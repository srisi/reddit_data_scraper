It is being sensationalised- that is the bread and butter of the media, plus there are people both on the side of the Chinese government and against them who wish to use this for their own advantage.

Proper measures are being taken, which is to say the very limited resources any authority can keep on hand for such an event are being used but won't make much of a difference.

It is definitely beyond containment given how it has behaved to date. Blockading cities will only slow it down, which will do some good in spreading the impact over time somewhat and buying time for a possible vaccine to be rolled out (though it will likely be poorly tested and will have its own potential negative impacts).

It is much worse than reported, not for its impact in terms of fatalities (apparently about 3 % of the 5 % of people that show enough symptoms to go to hospital, so about the same as measles but much less infectious and probably with less gnarly long term side effects). It also seems to mostly kill old and ill people, so that economic impact will be lessened there (and may even produce an economic benefit once the dust settles). The economic impacts of the morbidity and of measures to stop the spread may be the worst aspects of the disease. Shutting down large cities doesnt happen without its own costs. Kind of like amputating your arm to stop cooties spreading from your fingers."

The virus can land on the mask and while you don't immediately breathe it in, what happens when you get home? You bring the mask into your house with you. You can probably take the filter out and wash the mask but doing that in your house or even outside in front of your house brings the risk of becoming infected while you mess around with it. It's a very complicated situation that most people don't think about. 

\+ rumor is that it could also get into your eyes and infect you. Which does make sense really since your eye is an opening to your body. 

Wash your hands, do not touch your face, avoid people, eat healthy, drink lots of water, and if you do use a mask be very careful with it as ultimately like I said above - it could have virus on it and you'll be bringing that home with you. 

Viruses can survive a day to sometimes more outside of the body. I'm not an expert on the extreme specifics. I'm not sure if touching the reusable mask at home could stir the cells containing the virus off of the mask back into the air but that's a possibility, for sure touching the mask is a risk. You'll essentially have a mask with a possible virus on the front of it.

white people didnt even bring slaves to america... it was spanish jews, working with black tribes who sold  captured tribes to the slavers. 

white people are the only people in the world who have abolished slavery and they had to fight a war and give their lives to end it.  white republican northerners died by the thousands to end the southern democratic slavery in the united states. 

white people invented modern medicine, computers, planes, cars, cell phones, everything you are using in your blessed life was created by mostly white men who you hate so much.

all you want to do is focus on the bad things that some white people have done, and ignore everything good the majority of them have done  while at the same time  doing the opposite for every other color... except Asians who you seem to hate as well.

probably because Asians are very successful in america and it destroys you whole white people made america only for white people bullshit theroy.

you know who's theory that is? the white man bad theroy, its cultural Marxists, who killed 300 million people this century.  

you dont know history at all and you are carrying water for the biggest mass murdering ideology in the entire history of the world. 

you are ignorant, a bigot, and hateful and you are proud to promote the lies of an evil ideology.

This conspiracy game does not take you anywhere, and would only trap you inside a hole that is impossible to climb out of. Of course, take the Chinese gov't with a grain of salt, but these void speculations soothe no pain.

Bats are a major coronavirus carrier so it would be a top contestant for such research, and Wuhan's virus lab is the largest in China and among the top-funded in the world so it would not be strange for a Chinese scientist who wants to work back home to choose that facility. It is literally a ""State Key Lab,"" he would work there just like how American physicists would like to use facilities in the National Lab System like the Argonne or Fermilab.

Wuhan is a key city in the Chinese economy with 11.6M people living according to gov't data, as well as undocumented resident workers at least in hundreds of thousands if not 1M. This city also has insufficient medical infrastructure and standards in procedures. It is more likely for this disease to start in the wildlife and spread to the urban population than to leak from a highly secure lab.

But at least we have a good start on some new novel. Hope Alex Jones doesn't see this... Can't imagine what he'll say to those Rednecks after stuff like the ""frogs are turning gay..."""

It is highly likely Lyme disease is a bio weapon that escaped a lab in the USA. It spread along the migratory bird paths. 

The lab in Wuhan was a source of concern in 2017, with experts fearing diseases could accidentally escape into a dense population.

I have no issue with the fact that China is probably experimenting with biological weapons - so what - nearly every major country on Earth is doing the same.

The only way to make that shit better is investing in your local community, getting to know your local community and building it. There are three reasons why people to things, they think they are justified, their needs arent met or they have picked up on bad behaviors due to the inequality of the society they live in forcing them to do things for survival.

I find it funny how you hold the notion that humans are by nature corrupt which means governments are too. But you would rather be complicit and stay on the same path that obviously isnt working and is actively contributing to the suffering of others especially the less fortunate. Instead of being open at all open to the idea that maybe the solution is a new way of governing like idk self government. It's all about direct action. If there is a problem deal with it yourself and with the help of your neighbors and community. If people would operate like that there would be no need for police.

 Police are useless and are the enforcers of the bourgeoisie."

Your body \*does\* inactivate a lot of the viral particles you're exposed to upon entry. Just not all of it. If the viral load entering your body is low enough, you'll never know you ever came into contact with it. Antibody floating around your body binds viral particles, or killer cells recognize your own body cells that have been infiltrated with the virus and either kills the cells or your cells kill themselves. If the viral load you're exposed to is a moderate amount, you might feel sluggish for a bit as your immune system mounts a larger attack in order to get rid of infected cells. If the viral load is high enough, that's when your immune system mounting a large response affects you. Immunology is a really fascinating course and I implore people to take it every couple of years if possible.

I've been doing a mental exercise with people lately, I ask, can you name me anything good Trump has done and nobody can name shit cause all they hear all day long is how bad Trump is. I mainly just think people saying we almost went to WW3 over us killing a terrorist is ridiculous, I'm not saying whether it was right or wrong to do what we did, how we did it, but we were never even close to WW3 and people spreading that shit are just fear mongering and/or stupid

The last two videos I saw maybe an hour or two ago have set this in my mind that that's what is going on there. 
If you haven't seen them already, you can find them all over Twitter. 
One is a woman in a hazmat suit saying there are at least 100,000 infected with 90,000 dead already. 
The other video is a voice chat from another doctor who also says there are around 100,000 infected. If they're acting, sign them up for the next oscar because their videos were downright compelling. 
The other thing is, there have been bits and pieces of rumors coming out of Wuhan to the rest of us in China. And it is a way different story than what the government is pushing out. 
You also have to keep in mind that if people are choosing to die at home, the numbers are going to be severely under reported.

1. Researcher in BL-4 Wuhan facility did not decontaminate properly, went to the food market 8 miles away, an infection spread.
2. North Korea was testing Bio Chem Weapons on joint Chinese NK prison/labor camps. They tested on live subjects. The female subject escaped at around 1 a.m. and made her way to the Chinese border. The sex trafficker had sex with her and was contaminated. He went near the market in Wuhan and also aided in the spreading. 
3. BL-4 Junior researcher was trying to make extra money and instead of incinerating infected bats, he sold them. Specifically vampire bats. 
4. China did steal a strain from the Canadian BL-4 facility and were mandated to be removed from the facility. 
5. This was developed to mutate over and over, China has had issues since its 1 child policy in a predominated Male only order.  Hence demographic rates in china are so messed up.

My writing is a little messy srry
1. Today 20/1/25 the number of infected ppl i has reached 100,000and its getting bigger and bigger yesterday was 90,000
2.A lot of ppl in my country  are pretty sure that Chinese govermant is hiding numbersand actually much more serious
3. There has been exposure by a chinese doctor  that virus’ secondary mutation has begun. It means that at this current time where we have no vaccine it is VERY dangerous 
4.China(Especially wuhan districts) is running out of masks medical equipments etc there is a video where a chinese nurse is asking ppl to donate clothes and masks etc
5.From yesterday, China has started its biggest holiday and millions are on their way to different countries for vacations Which means that ppl who is from Wuhan has already left the town before blockade order and the govermnat is letting go of ppl who claims to go to their hometown
6.That means we have to pay attention to the airport but some of them are taking fever reducer to pass the thermal detection camera(This was proven by a Chinese who went to FR)
7.Countries cannot stop Chinese from coming because of international law matters so we need WHO to order emergency but they are not doing shit Although ppl all over the world are infected
8.The head doctor who manahed SARS is estimating that this is ten times more dangerous than SARS in2003
9.This started from a market taht sells animals illegally in Wuhan but the market sellers has already washed away everything so we cant know the actual source
10.Doctors has said that its portable through eyes.
11.Watch these videos to realize how much serious it is [Chinese nurse asking for help](https://youtu.be/yQflXs0jZ9w) [Corona Birus from Wuhan](https://youtu.be/hhFdSzU6hR4)

They dont understand the germs that spread animal to animal. China is holding responsibility for the virus too. Remember, their people are the main ones dying from it. That's why they're trying their best to control it and giving information about the virus to other countries. ""Its about health codes so people dont die"" China did do that!

Frankly that video looks really fake.  The fact that the person isn't showing their surroundings in combination with the fact they are wearing yellow overalls (most videos show nurses wearing white) suggests to me that it is a fake.

Let's say that it is real though.  We only need to apply some fairly basic critical thinking here to see that it's not a reliable source.  Why should I accept the word of one nurse?  Nurses deal with patients in the tens, maybe up to a hundred at most.  What makes this one nurse an authority to say that it's any more than what they and their immediate colleagues are handling?  how does this one nurse know that it is 90,000?  Nobody reports to them.  It's very probable that this person (if they are a real nurse) is overestimating the real number.

It actually really irritates me that there are people out there spreading this crap.  I live in China and these lies affect my life.  It puts fear into the people around me, including my pregnant wife who may need to go to a hospital soon.

US chartering flight to evacuate citizens from Wuhan

The US is beginning an operation to evacuate American citizens and diplomats from Wuhan, the Wall Street Journal (WSJ) has said.
There are around 1,000 Americans in Wuhan, the epicentre of the coronavirus outbreak, and the embassy is in the process of contacting them to arrange seats on a plane back to the US. Plans are in place for the consulate to close temporarily, the newspaper said.
There are only 230 seats on the plane, according to the WSJ report, and those on board will have to pay the costs entailed. American medical personnel will be on board to treat suspected cases of the coronavirus, and any available seats may be offered to non-US citizens.

I never said that mutated virii REPLACE unmuted virii. I understand how mutations work, and that pathogens can and do die out in a host population due to random mutation. This has been illustrated in history in humans and animals many times. The more virulent mutations increase the odds of the death, and at an inflection point the population of the more virulent strains is reduced or eliminated due to these deaths, and in the modern world, medication and/or quarantine. Meanwhile, stronger survivors may have or develop varying levels of resistance, adding to herd resistance or immunity. The weaker mutations continue to circulate (i.e. common cold), potentially continuing to *improve* herd resistance or immunity, because they don't critically affect the host, such as the four common corona viruses.

I maintain that your original statement about mutations getting worse is just spreading FUD. This outbreak is just that - an outbreak, and could turn quickly in either direction."

This is a lab made virus in a lab in wuhan do your research people the funds from this chemical bio test facility is funded by the one and only Bill Gates and his wife. Who gave us warning about a pandemic with a coronavirus.  Also this lab was cleaned not to long ago and this is possibly how the virus got out. Not just from the weird shit they are eating. Have you ever heard of a government locking down towns with 20 million people if it's just a damn flu? I have been watching videos of people in the streets falling. Hospital's with dead patients on cots in hallways streets with dead people.  The hospital's are running out of supplies they have nothing in their stores. No medical supplies and the medical staff are not becoming sick and dying as well. This was made to be a weapon what for ask Trump and his people. This is one hell of a trade deal and sure is taking the attention away from his impeachment hmmm.

Or it could have been a coincidence that an outbreak started in the city they were working in. 

Or it could have been orchestrated by Iran to destabilize the major political powers. 

&#x200B;

See. Thats where the 'could have' game gets you. Its another way of confirmation bias where people come up with something that still fits in their presumptions so their crazy talk still might be reasonable. 

&#x200B;

Its not. When you do that. Everything becomes possible and depending on your particular level of crazy, more probable. 

&#x200B;

If this happened in Foshan where SARS originated. People would be searching for connections between that city and people studying viruses who were working there. Its just an outlet for anxiety, but a dangerous one because its contagious.

Its not a time for downright crazy Hollywod type hypotheticals."
