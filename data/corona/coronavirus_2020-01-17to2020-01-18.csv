A virus outbreak in such a densely populated country like China or Japan is the worst. Let’s hope they can beat it before antivaxx dipshits can spread it even further.
2020-01-17,snikrepab_,news,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/news/comments/eq52ue/travelers_at_3_us_airports_to_be_screened_for_new/fenqh45/,"CDC staff will ask travelers about symptoms, places they have visited in Wuhan, and take temperatures. Suspected cases of illness will be transported safely to pre-designated facilities in those cities, Cetron said. Many will likely end up being referred for further evaluation, and that may take hours and up to a day, officials said. As a result, “it’s unlikely they will make immediate connecting flights,” Cetron said.

CDC officials acknowledged that in the middle of winter, it’s far more likely that symptoms will be caused by common winter viruses than the new virus, he said. At airports in Asia, authorities have screened thousands of people before they identified the one or two individual cases, he said.

The three cases outside China include two Chinese tourists who flew to Thailand. The first tourist is in stable condition. The second arrived in Thailand on Monday with a fever, Thai authorities said. The third case is a Chinese resident of Japan whose case was confirmed on Thursday. He has recovered. All three travelers flew from Wuhan.

New information from China[ late Friday](http://wjw.wuhan.gov.cn/front/web/showDetail/2020011809065) about additional infections among people who had close contact with initial patients, but did not go the animal market believed to be the origin of the outbreak, provides more evidence for human to human transmission. The patient in Japan also had not been to the Wuhan animal market but had “potential close contact with unspecified pneumonia patients in China,” according to the [Japanese Ministry of Health](https://www.mhlw.go.jp/stf/newpage_08906.html).

One reason for concern is that the new pathogen is in the family of viruses that includes severe acute respiratory syndrome, or SARS. The[ SARS epidemic](https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/politics/2003/04/24/thousands-flee-beijing-fearing-sars/da04ce95-058d-408c-ad97-a8f2017e4058/?tid=lk_inline_manual_23) began in China in November 2002 and over eight months, infected more than 8,000 people, killed 774 and sparked mass panic as it spread across more than two dozen countries before it was contained in the summer of 2003.

SARS spread to humans through infected civet cats sold in live animal markets. Most patients in the Wuhan outbreak also worked or had some other exposure to a [large live animal and seafood market](http://wjw.wuhan.gov.cn/front/web/showDetail/2020011509040) that Chinese authorities shut down Jan. 1.

The airport screening is the first time such monitoring has been deployed for an infectious disease since the Ebola epidemic in 2014, when officials screened travelers arriving at U.S. airports from three West African countries: Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone.

Since Wednesday, passengers at the international airport in Wuhan have been required to pass through electronic temperature sensors at each of its doors, according to the South China Morning Post. Anyone with a temperature over 100 degrees is required to undergo a manual check and if high temperature is confirmed, “spend a period of time in a quarantine facility.”

Health officials say they don’t yet have enough information to draw conclusions about whether the new virus can spread easily from person to person, or describe its clinical features. The source of the virus also remains unknown.

But the emergence of a new respiratory illness that originated from an animal has raised concerns among health officials and infectious disease experts. If an infected person gets on a plane, “they have the potential to transmit the virus on the way, and the more people who are infected, the more chances the virus has to replicate in people and mutate,” said Matt Freiman, a virologist and associate professor at the University of Maryland School of Medicine who studies [coronaviruses](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/index.html).

Human coronaviruses, known for their crown-like spikes on their surfaces, cause illnesses of differing severity. Some transmit easily. Novel coronaviruses emerge periodically, with SARS emerging in southern China in 2002 and MERS, or Middle East respiratory syndrome, a decade later.

With cases of the new virus found in Japan and the most recent case in Thailand, there is increased worry of spread to a wider area, Freiman said.

“This also suggests that either animals shedding the virus are still in Wuhan or that there is more human-to-human spread than is recognized,” he said. “Both of these scenarios are problematic for control of this new virus.”

Of 45 confirmed cases in China, most were male, middle-aged and elderly, with early symptoms of fever and cough, Wuhan health authorities said. The patients included a man who worked at the closed market and his wife, who had never visited it. The two who died were both men over 60 with underlying chronic diseases. The first had been a regular customer at the market, but health authorities have not said whether the second had contact with it. Five others are reported to have severe illnesses.

Of the 45 cases, four — all men — were reported late Friday, Wuhan health authorities said. Their condition is stable. In addition, of 17 close contacts of the first confirmed patient in Thailand, at least one has low fever and mild cough, authorities said.

The number of serious illnesses indicate this “is a big worry, this is a legitimate infection and that this is really going to cause problems,” Freiman said.

Controlling transmission and finding the animal source are key, say health officials. Chinese authorities said specimens collected from the closed market tested positive for the new virus.

Several countries in Asia have increased surveillance and entry screening at airports and other transport hubs. Suspect cases with pneumonia and recent travel history to Wuhan have been detected in Hong Kong, Macao, Singapore, South Korea and Taiwan.

Analysis of air travel patterns to map the potential spread of the new virus found that the top 20 destinations for travelers from Wuhan are in Asia. Bangkok, Hong Kong, Tokyo and Taipei had the largest volume, according to a study in the Journal of Travel Medicine, based on 2018 travel data."

Federal health officials said Friday they will begin screening airline passengers arriving at three U.S. airports for a [new virus from central China ](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/asia_pacific/china-identifies-new-strain-of-coronavirus-as-source-of-pneumonia-outbreak/2020/01/09/f2625650-329f-11ea-971b-43bec3ff9860_story.html?tid=lk_inline_manual_2)that has sickened dozens of people with pneumonialike illnesses and killed two.

Starting immediately, the screenings will be conducted at specially designated areas of Los Angeles, San Francisco, and New York’s John F. Kennedy international airports. Those airports receive most of the travelers on direct and connecting flights from the central Chinese city of Wuhan, a major transportation and business hub where a cluster of pneumonialike illnesses was first identified last month, officials said. Staff from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention will administer questionnaires and check for fever and other symptoms.

The announcement comes as millions of people in China are already traveling across the country and overseas for [Lunar New Year](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/asia_pacific/specter-of-possible-new-virus-emerging-from-central-china-raises-alarms-across-asia/2020/01/08/3d33046c-312f-11ea-971b-43bec3ff9860_story.html?tid=lk_inline_manual_4), which officially starts Jan. 25. There are direct flights several times a week from Wuhan to San Francisco and JFK airports, including one scheduled to arrive Friday in New York at 10 p.m.

Three additional cases have also been reported in other parts of Asia, the most recent Friday in a Chinese tourist who traveled to Bangkok, according to Thai officials. There are no known U.S. cases.

The World Health Organization said in [a statement ](https://www.who.int/csr/don/16-january-2020-novel-coronavirus-japan-ex-china/en/)Thursday that additional cases in other countries are likely, given global travel patterns, a sentiment that CDC officials echoed Friday.

“This is a serious situation,” said Nancy Messonnier, who oversees CDC’s National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases. Referring to previous epidemics of acute respiratory outbreaks that were serious and complex, she said it was crucial for the United States to be proactive and prepared.

At the start of an outbreak, the earliest cases tend to be the most severe, she said. “As we do more testing, we’re likely to see more cases, and I think we’ll see at least a case in the United States,"" she told reporters during a Friday news briefing. “That’s why we’re moving forward so quickly with this screening.”

About 5,000 people arrive at the three airports weekly, said Martin Cetron, director of CDC’s division of global migration and quarantine. Only JFK and San Francisco airports have direct flights. About 60,000 to 65,000 people arrive on direct and connecting flights from Wuhan every year in the United States, he said.

The risk to Americans is low, officials said. “But the earlier we detect, the better we can protect,” Cetron said."

The announcement comes as millions of people in China are already traveling across the country and overseas for [Lunar New Year](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/asia_pacific/specter-of-possible-new-virus-emerging-from-central-china-raises-alarms-across-asia/2020/01/08/3d33046c-312f-11ea-971b-43bec3ff9860_story.html?tid=lk_inline_manual_4), which officially starts Jan. 25. There are direct flights several times a week from Wuhan to San Francisco and JFK airports, including one scheduled to arrive Friday in New York at 10 p.m.

Three additional cases have also been reported in other parts of Asia, the most recent Friday in a Chinese tourist who traveled to Bangkok, according to Thai officials. There are no known U.S. cases.

The World Health Organization said in [a statement ](https://www.who.int/csr/don/16-january-2020-novel-coronavirus-japan-ex-china/en/)Thursday that additional cases in other countries are likely, given global travel patterns, a sentiment that CDC officials echoed Friday.

“This is a serious situation,” said Nancy Messonnier, who oversees CDC’s National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases. Referring to previous epidemics of acute respiratory outbreaks that were serious and complex, she said it was crucial for the United States to be proactive and prepared.

At the start of an outbreak, the earliest cases tend to be the most severe, she said. “As we do more testing, we’re likely to see more cases, and I think we’ll see at least a case in the United States,"" she told reporters during a Friday news briefing. “That’s why we’re moving forward so quickly with this screening.”

About 5,000 people arrive at the three airports weekly, said Martin Cetron, director of CDC’s division of global migration and quarantine. Only JFK and San Francisco airports have direct flights. About 60,000 to 65,000 people arrive on direct and connecting flights from Wuhan every year in the United States, he said.

The risk to Americans is low, officials said. “But the earlier we detect, the better we can protect,” Cetron said."

Having more infections than the official confirmed cases will be true of practically all diseases and epidemics. This is just because no matter which disease in question, not all cases can be identified by health officials. The official tally contains only confirmed cases. This is even more challenging in cases where the disease cause nonspecific symptoms, often described as flu like. Plus, it's also flu season and that masks some of the nCoV (novel coronavirus, the temporary name given to this new virus) infections and attributed to influenza instead. I've got flu like symptoms right now, how do I know it's not the new CoV? It's unlikely and I've never been to Wuhan, but I won't know for absolute sure unless I get tested and the causative agent gets sequenced. That's a lot of time and resources and it's not feasible to do that for everyone showing flu like symptoms in the middle of flu season. 

If there are indeed some person to person transmission, it's likely that the virus has also spread to other cities. It's just that it's super hard to detect because the resources for the tests are typically reserved for those risk groups that traveled in Wuhan. 

What is most likely happening is that sequencing tests for potential cases are typically done to patients that progress beyond the nonspecific symptoms, likely those that progress to pneumonia. Also keep in mind that not everyone will respond the same way to the same infectious disease agent. For all diseases, there will be a spectrum of host symptoms, ranging from absolutely nothing at all to full blown disease. Those with nCoV but with mild symptoms would probably just recover by themselves at home, and thus never be detected as a confirmed case and noone's the wiser.

To be honest, it's likely for some person to person transmission to have occurred, given the recent data. I'd be concerned about superspreading events like with SARS, that for some damn reason, some hosts are just super efficient at spreading the disease, often without severe symptoms themselves. R0 value for the spreaders are magnitudes higher that the background R0 value of the disease. Plus, it's near lunar new year and everyone disperses in China to go home and be with family. Lots of movement makes contact tracing and containment policies highly difficult if not impossible. 

The data extrapolation that the scientists in the article used to estimate the number of infections isn't without merit but I can't help but wonder if all it does right now is just spreading unnecessary concern. At least, at this time."

2020-01-17,Bushuazoo,news,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/news/comments/epyfz2/japan_and_thailand_confirm_new_cases_of_chinese/femhcel/,"BEIJING — Thailand and Japan each reported new cases of a coronavirus that has left two people dead and at least 40 sick in China, adding to concerns about the spread of the virus beyond Chinese borders ahead of a major holiday.

Health officials in Thailand on Friday said they had found a second case of the mysterious pneumonialike coronavirus in that country, in a 74-year-old Chinese woman. The woman is in good and stable condition, said a spokesman for Thailand’s public health ministry, Rungrueng Kitphati.

The woman entered Thailand through Bangkok via a flight from the central Chinese city of Wuhan, the epicenter of the outbreak. Investigators were still trying to gather information from the woman but have been hindered by a language barrier, Mr. Rungrueng said.

On Thursday, Japan’s Health Ministry said that a Chinese man in his 30s tested positive for the coronavirus. The man, a resident of Kanagawa Prefecture, just south of Tokyo, returned to Japan on Jan. 6 after traveling to Wuhan. The man, who came down with a fever on Jan. 3, was hospitalized on Friday but was discharged five days later because he had recovered, according to the Health Ministry.

The World Health Organization said it was highly likely that the virus had spread from a seafood market in Wuhan that also sells live birds and other animals. But Japan’s Health Ministry said the patient had not visited any seafood markets in China, adding that “it is possible that the patient had close contact with an unknown patient with lung inflammation while in China.”

Malik Peiris, a public health virologist at the University of Hong Kong, said, “If that was the case, that there had been no direct exposure to animals, then that is very concerning, for sure.
The disclosures on Thursday and Friday brought to three the total number of confirmed cases of the new coronavirus reported outside of China in the last week.

On Monday, the authorities in Thailand detected the virus in a 61-year-old Chinese woman who was visiting from Wuhan, the capital of the central Chinese province of Hubei.

Dr. Sopon Iamsirithaworn, director of the communicable diseases division at Thailand’s Ministry of Public Health, said the woman had not visited the Wuhan seafood market, and had come down with a fever on Jan. 5. However, the doctor said, the woman had visited a different, smaller market in Wuhan, in which live and freshly slaughtered animals were also sold.

The woman is in good health now, according to Dr. Suthat Chottanapund, a senior official in the disease control department of Thailand’s Public Health Ministry. But, he said, the health authorities were waiting for laboratory results to confirm that the woman is free of the coronavirus before discharging her. She said that she wanted to do some sightseeing after she leaves the hospital, he said The revelation that neither the patient in Japan nor the first one found in Thailand had visited the Huanan Seafood Market, to which most of the cases have been linked, is a troubling sign that the outbreak could be spreading in Wuhan. The market was shut down and disinfected on Jan. 1, but new cases have appeared since, suggesting the virus has not been eradicated.

Concerns have grown across the region since the Chinese health authorities announced the discovery of the mysterious new virus, which has sickened dozens of people in Wuhan with pneumonialike symptoms. The city’s health commission said on Wednesday that the risk of human-to-human transmission is low but possible. Officials also said they detected the first cluster of the virus involving members of a single family.

The new virus has stirred memories in China of the 2003 outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome, or SARS. That virus, which is believed to have jumped to humans from animals at markets, originated in China and killed more than 800 people worldwide in 2002 and 2003. At the time, the Chinese government tried to cover up the problem, resulting in a backlash among its people. While flu experts have said the Chinese government is trying to be more transparent now, many in China are skeptical.

The local authorities in Wuhan and the W.H.O. have reiterated for weeks that no cases of human-to-human transmission have been confirmed.

Last week, researchers in China said they had “initially identified” a new coronavirus as the pathogen behind the mysterious respiratory illness. Of the 40 cases diagnosed in Wuhan, the majority of patients are middle-age and older men, the city’s health commission said on Wednesday. Five people are in critical condition, officials said.

Two deaths have been reported in China, both in Wuhan: a 69-year-old man who fell ill on New Year’s Eve and died Wednesday, and a 61-year-old man who died last week and had previously been diagnosed with abdominal tumors and liver disease.

The most recent case in China was detected on Jan. 3. The minimum incubation period for some viral infections is 15 days, suggesting that it could be a few more days before the authorities are able to determine the full extent of the outbreak.

That timeline has fueled concerns among governments across the region, especially ahead of the Lunar New Year holiday, which begins next week. Hundreds of millions of people in China are expected to travel during the holiday. Thailand expects more than 300,000 Chinese visitors during the holiday, according to local tourism officials. 

Hong Kong, Singapore, Thailand and South Korea have taken precautionary measures, quarantining patients with flulike symptoms and increasing temperature screenings at their airports. Japan said it was investigating who the patient there had been in contact with since he returned from China and has asked people who experience symptoms to report them.

While the new coronavirus appears to be less virulent and deadly than SARS, many questions remain, including the source of the virus and its transmission route. Infectious disease experts say the source is very likely to be a mammal because coronaviruses spread easily from mammals to humans.


Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses that infect animals and people. Symptoms of different coronaviruses can include those that resemble the common cold, influenza or pneumonia.

“There’s no need to panic but I think there needs to be an urgency to address these questions,” said Dr. Peiris of the University of Hong Kong. “The problem is that most of these animals are illegally sold, so that might not be so easy to do.”

Dr. Peiris said he was encouraged that there were no cases of hospital workers falling ill, reducing the likelihood of a widespread outbreak within the community, as there had been with SARS.

Guan Yi, a professor of infectious diseases at the University of Hong Kong, said he was also reassured that the Wuhan government had not reported any new cases in recent days.

“If there are no new cases in the next few days, the outbreak is over,” said Dr. Guan, who was part of a team that successfully identified the coronavirus that caused SARS.

Thats what i was wondering. So even if you have just normal  flu you will be quarantined huh?

But we come back to my original question again, How do you determine what it is that the aprient has? How do you deteermine that its the coronavirus (Wuhan disease) and not just a normal flu? Is there like specific knwon symptoms for it? 

>Thailand in particular, that tourist didn't show symptoms until they arrived in Thailand. Chinese officials missed them.

Yupp. Thats another thing . Lets say you are in Wuhan today and you catch the WUhan disease and you fly to US tomorrow. You probably wouldnt show any symptoms when going through  the customs right?

I think so too. It could easily turn into a Spanish flu Episode 2 if it was more infective as an airborne disease."
2020-01-17,snikrepab_,EverythingScience,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/EverythingScience/comments/eq51f5/travelers_at_3_us_airports_to_be_screened_for_new/fenpuf1/," CDC staff will ask travelers about symptoms, places they have visited in Wuhan, and take temperatures. Suspected cases of illness will be transported safely to pre-designated facilities in those cities, Cetron said. Many will likely end up being referred for further evaluation, and that may take hours and up to a day, officials said. As a result, “it’s unlikely they will make immediate connecting flights,” Cetron said.

CDC officials acknowledged that in the middle of winter, it’s far more likely that symptoms will be caused by common winter viruses than the new virus, he said. At airports in Asia, authorities have screened thousands of people before they identified the one or two individual cases, he said.

The three cases outside China include two Chinese tourists who flew to Thailand. The first tourist is in stable condition. The second arrived in Thailand on Monday with a fever, Thai authorities said. The third case is a Chinese resident of Japan whose case was confirmed on Thursday. He has recovered. All three travelers flew from Wuhan.

New information from China[ late Friday](http://wjw.wuhan.gov.cn/front/web/showDetail/2020011809065) about additional infections among people who had close contact with initial patients, but did not go the animal market believed to be the origin of the outbreak, provides more evidence for human to human transmission. The patient in Japan also had not been to the Wuhan animal market but had “potential close contact with unspecified pneumonia patients in China,” according to the [Japanese Ministry of Health](https://www.mhlw.go.jp/stf/newpage_08906.html).

One reason for concern is that the new pathogen is in the family of viruses that includes severe acute respiratory syndrome, or SARS. The[ SARS epidemic](https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/politics/2003/04/24/thousands-flee-beijing-fearing-sars/da04ce95-058d-408c-ad97-a8f2017e4058/?tid=lk_inline_manual_23) began in China in November 2002 and over eight months, infected more than 8,000 people, killed 774 and sparked mass panic as it spread across more than two dozen countries before it was contained in the summer of 2003.

SARS spread to humans through infected civet cats sold in live animal markets. Most patients in the Wuhan outbreak also worked or had some other exposure to a [large live animal and seafood market](http://wjw.wuhan.gov.cn/front/web/showDetail/2020011509040) that Chinese authorities shut down Jan. 1.

The airport screening is the first time such monitoring has been deployed for an infectious disease since the Ebola epidemic in 2014, when officials screened travelers arriving at U.S. airports from three West African countries: Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone.

Since Wednesday, passengers at the international airport in Wuhan have been required to pass through electronic temperature sensors at each of its doors, according to the South China Morning Post. Anyone with a temperature over 100 degrees is required to undergo a manual check and if high temperature is confirmed, “spend a period of time in a quarantine facility.”

Health officials say they don’t yet have enough information to draw conclusions about whether the new virus can spread easily from person to person, or describe its clinical features. The source of the virus also remains unknown.

But the emergence of a new respiratory illness that originated from an animal has raised concerns among health officials and infectious disease experts. If an infected person gets on a plane, “they have the potential to transmit the virus on the way, and the more people who are infected, the more chances the virus has to replicate in people and mutate,” said Matt Freiman, a virologist and associate professor at the University of Maryland School of Medicine who studies [coronaviruses](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/index.html).

Human coronaviruses, known for their crown-like spikes on their surfaces, cause illnesses of differing severity. Some transmit easily. Novel coronaviruses emerge periodically, with SARS emerging in southern China in 2002 and MERS, or Middle East respiratory syndrome, a decade later.

With cases of the new virus found in Japan and the most recent case in Thailand, there is increased worry of spread to a wider area, Freiman said.

“This also suggests that either animals shedding the virus are still in Wuhan or that there is more human-to-human spread than is recognized,” he said. “Both of these scenarios are problematic for control of this new virus.”

Of 45 confirmed cases in China, most were male, middle-aged and elderly, with early symptoms of fever and cough, Wuhan health authorities said. The patients included a man who worked at the closed market and his wife, who had never visited it. The two who died were both men over 60 with underlying chronic diseases. The first had been a regular customer at the market, but health authorities have not said whether the second had contact with it. Five others are reported to have severe illnesses.

Of the 45 cases, four — all men — were reported late Friday, Wuhan health authorities said. Their condition is stable. In addition, of 17 close contacts of the first confirmed patient in Thailand, at least one has low fever and mild cough, authorities said.

The number of serious illnesses indicate this “is a big worry, this is a legitimate infection and that this is really going to cause problems,” Freiman said.

Controlling transmission and finding the animal source are key, say health officials. Chinese authorities said specimens collected from the closed market tested positive for the new virus.

Several countries in Asia have increased surveillance and entry screening at airports and other transport hubs. Suspect cases with pneumonia and recent travel history to Wuhan have been detected in Hong Kong, Macao, Singapore, South Korea and Taiwan.

Analysis of air travel patterns to map the potential spread of the new virus found that the top 20 destinations for travelers from Wuhan are in Asia. Bangkok, Hong Kong, Tokyo and Taipei had the largest volume, according to a study in the Journal of Travel Medicine, based on 2018 travel data."

[Press Release:] (https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2020/p0117-coronavirus-screening.html?deliveryName=USCDC_1_3-DM17441)

>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the Department of Homeland Security’s Customs and Border Protection (CBP) will implement enhanced health screenings to detect ill travelers traveling to the United States on direct or connecting flights from Wuhan, China. This activity is in response to an outbreak in China caused by a novel (new) coronavirus (2019 nCoV), with exported cases to Thailand and Japan.

>Starting January 17, 2020, travelers from Wuhan to the United States will undergo entry screening for symptoms associated with 2019-nCoV at three U.S. airports that receive most of the travelers from Wuhan, China: San Francisco (SFO), New York (JFK), and Los Angeles (LAX) airports.

>“To further protect the health of the American public during the emergence of this novel coronavirus, CDC is beginning entry screening at three ports of entry. Investigations into this novel coronavirus are ongoing and we are monitoring and responding to this evolving situation,” said Martin Cetron, M.D., Director of CDC’s Division of Global Migration and Quarantine.

>Based on current information, the risk from 2019-nCoV to the American public is currently deemed to be low. Nevertheless, CDC is taking proactive preparedness precautions.

>Entry screening is part of a layered approach used with other public health measures already in place to detect arriving travelers who are sick (such as detection and reporting of ill travelers by airlines during travel and referral of ill travelers arriving at a US port of entry by CBP) to slow and reduce the spread of any disease into the United States.

>CDC is deploying about 100 additional staff to the three airports (SFO, JFK, and LAX) to supplement existing staff at CDC quarantine stations located at those airports.

>CDC is actively monitoring this situation for pertinent information about the source of outbreak, and risk for further spread through person-to-person or animal-to-person transmission. CDC may adjust screening procedures and other response activities as this outbreak investigation continues and more is learned about the newly emerging virus. Entry screening alone is not a guarantee against the possible importation of this new virus but is an important public health tool during periods of uncertainty and part of a multilayered government response strategy. As new information emerges, CDC will reassess entry screening measures and could scale activities up or down accordingly.

>On Jan. 11, 2020, CDC updated a Level 1 Travel Health Notice (“practice usual precautions”) for travelers to Wuhan City and an updated Health Alert to health care professionals and public health partners with new and updated guidance is forthcoming.

>China health officials report that most of the patients infected with 2019-nCoV have had exposure to a large market where live animals were present, suggesting this is a novel virus that has jumped the species barrier to infect people. Chinese authorities additionally report that several hundred health care workers caring for outbreak patients are being monitored and no spread of this virus from patients to health care workers has been seen. They report no sustained spread of this virus in the community, however there are indications that some limited person-to-person spread may have occurred. CDC is responding to this outbreak out of an abundance of caution, ready to detect people infected with 2019-CoV.
