2020-03-05,IrritableIrvin,Coronavirus,116,https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/fe39kx/pretty_stark_statement_from_a_kaiser_nurse_in/fjlij6n/,">I volunteered to be on the care team for this patient, who we knew was positive. I did this because I had all the recommended protective gear and training from my employer. I did this assuming that if something happened to me, of course I too would be cared for. Then, what was a small concern after a few days of caring for this patient, became my reality:  
>  
>I started getting sick.  
>  
>When employee health told me that my fever and other symptoms fit the criteria for potential coronavirus, I was put on a 14-day self-quarantine. Since the criteria was met, the testing would be done. My doctor ordered the test through the county.  
>  
>The public county officer called me and verified my symptoms and agreed with the testing. But the National CDC would not initiate testing. They said they would not test me because if I were wearing the recommended protective equipment, then I wouldn't have the coronavirus.

This is absolutely outrageous. Can you imagine the response if the US government refused to pay death benefits to soldiers because ""if they were doing their job, they wouldn't have died?""

If we can't even take care of the nurses who are literally risking their lives to fight this thing while no one else is even taking it seriously, what are we doing?

This makes me sick to my stomach."

>What kind of science-based answer is that?  What a ridiculous and uneducated response from the department that is in charge of our health in this country. 

>Later, they called back, and now it’s an issue with something called the “identifier number.” They claim they prioritize running samples by illness severity and that there are only so many to give out each day. So I have to wait in line to find out the results.

All signs point to the CDC being caught with its pants down and not having nearly enough test kits to respond to these outbreaks, despite two months of advance notice. They're using bureaucratic red tape to disguise the complete logistics fuckup."

Sure, obviously, China f'ed up bigtime at first but they got it under control quick and now it's almost completely back to normal here.

And Hubei is a different story.... Not included in my viewpoint here

Edit:  i live in Kunming. It's been 2 full weeks since the last new case. This was the milestone they have been waiting for to start opening places again.

KIRKLAND, Wash. — The hardest day of Debbie de los Angeles’s life had been the day she put her mother into a nursing home. That was before coronavirus.


As fatal infections spread through the Life Care Center in suburban Seattle, where her 85-year-old mother lived, Ms. de los Angeles had tried not to worry. Nurses were monitoring her mother’s temperature. They reassured Ms. de los Angeles that her mother had no fever, cough or other signs of infection.


But at 4:15 a.m. on Tuesday, a nurse called with troubling news. Her mother, Twilla Morin, had developed a 104-degree fever. They were giving her Tylenol. Then the nurse confirmed her do-not-resuscitate orders.


“We anticipate that she, too, has the coronavirus,” a voicemail message from a nurse said. “We do not anticipate her fighting this.”


Moving into a nursing home can be a wrenching choice for aging parents and their adult children. But families said they never imagined facing a public health crisis in the quiet hallways where they once believed their loved ones would be safe.


In the week since the Kirkland nursing facility became the focal point of an unfolding coronavirus outbreak in the Pacific Northwest, daily life has stalled into a sleepless, slow-motion agony. With visits restricted, families now call and call for updates from the overworked nursing staff. The families wonder whether they should demand a visit, risking their own health and wider contamination. Some want their parents moved to the hospital or to a different facility but have no idea who else would care for fragile patients potentially exposed to a deadly disease.



“I just feel ill that my mom could be dying alone,” said Vanessa Phelps, whose 90-year-old mother has chronic breathing problems and has lived at the facility for four years. “It’s pure panic and I can do nothing. I have no control.”


Some families now call twice a day to ask how their octogenarian parents are feeling and reassure them about the alarming television news transmitted into their rooms, much of it featuring the crisis right there inside the center. Some video chat on tablet computers designed for older users. One woman stood outside her mother’s window to catch a glimpse between the slats.


It has been like seeing a ship sink without lifeboats. “We are watching from the shore and not being able to do anything,” said Alex Stewart, whose 95-year-old grandmother lives in the nursing center and has been crocheting a small blanket in anticipation of Ms. Stewart’s baby — her first great-grandchild. “It is a very helpless feeling.”


Nobody knows for sure how the coronavirus first entered the facility, which has become a grim warning of how the virus can spread particularly quickly inside nursing homes. At least eight of the 14 coronavirus deaths in the United States have been Life Care residents, and at least a half dozen other people connected to the facility have been sickened by the virus.



Even amid intense scrutiny of the nursing center and its record of handling infections, families said they were struggling to get basic information from Life Care’s leaders and public health officials. They said they had spent untold hours on the phone, being shunted between county and state government offices and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.



One man said he called a federal hotline and introduced himself as the son of an octogenarian Life Care resident. The response, he said, was concerning: He was asked whether there had been any coronavirus cases in his area.


Many residents inside the 190-bed facility went days without being tested for coronavirus, families said, even as they and their roommates started coughing and feeling feverish. Families worry that the true number of infections may be higher than official totals.


Experts in infectious diseases say older people, many of whom have underlying health problems and respiratory problems, are particularly vulnerable to the virus and have a higher risk of death.



Continue reading the main story
“People keep saying, ‘Why don’t you just go and bust them out?’” said Kevin Connolly, whose 81-year-old father-in-law, Jerry Wall, has been at the home for about a year recovering from heart failure.


“It’s his home,” Mr. Connolly said. “He likes the food, he likes the care, he has friends there.”


At a news conference on Wednesday, Dr. Jeff Duchin, the officer for public health in Seattle and King County, said teams were now working to test every Life Care resident for the virus, and apologized for a breakdown in communication. A federal disaster medical assistance team was expected to arrive at the center on Thursday.

Ellie Basham, the executive director of Life Care, said in a statement that it was assigning every resident a representative who could answer questions from family members.

Families welcomed the promised help, and praised the nurses and caregivers who showed up to work even as the virus spread and as several employees tested positive. It appeared that the virus tests were underway on Thursday; one relative reported that her father had been swabbed.


On Wednesday night, Ms. Stewart said her grandmother had begun to feel chills and short of breath.


“She rang for the nurse, but they hadn’t come yet,” Ms. Stewart said. By Thursday, her grandmother was feeling better. “We’re hoping it was just a blip and not the virus,” Ms. Stewart said. “But we don’t know yet until she’s tested.”


Day by day, desperation has grown for families of sicker, weaker residents.


Bridget Parkhill’s 77-year-old mother had been ill for nearly a week inside the home. On Wednesday, she was taken to the hospital after her coughing worsened and she felt a heaviness in her chest. “We are devastated that it’s come to this,” Ms. Parkhill said. Her mother returned to the home on Thursday.
Ms. de los Angeles, 65, said that her mother, Ms. Morin, had never wanted to move into a nursing home.

Ms. Morin had been a numbers whiz, once halting an embezzlement scheme while working as a bookkeeper. She had also learned to day trade stocks and would get up early for the market open on Wall Street, three time zones ahead of her home in Kennewick, in southeastern Washington State.

Ms. Morin moved into her first nursing home about four years ago after she could no longer stand or walk by herself. As her dementia deepened, Ms. Morin sometimes confused Ms. de los Angeles, her only child, for her sister.

Her world at the Life Care Center, where she had lived for two years, had narrowed to her shared room, the wheelchair she rolled to the dining room and the table where she often ate by herself. She loved a cup of hot chocolate at night and cared for a doll as if it were a real child. In lucid moments, she knew she was proud of her grandsons, Ms. de los Angeles said.



Ms. de los Angeles wanted to race to the nursing facility this week when she heard that her mother’s condition was deteriorating. But she knew the risks of infecting her husband, who has lung problems, were too great.


She got regular updates from the nurses caring for her mother, and was comforted that mother’s favorite nurse was on duty, and that her mother appeared to be mostly sleeping. And yet.
“We wanted to be there,” Ms. de los Angeles said. “She was alone.”


Early on Wednesday morning, Ms. de los Angeles woke to a new voicemail message from Life Care. Her mother had died at 2:10 a.m., the message said. Because of the “unique situation” at the home, her mother’s remains had to be picked up by the coroner, a nurse said.


By late morning, Ms. de los Angeles and her husband, Bob, were sitting on living-room couches at their home in Monroe, Wash., surrounded by their four grown sons, looking at old photos and sharing memories of Ms. Morin.


They had to arrange her cremation and decide whether it was safe to pick up her ring, stuffed teddy bear and other belongings. They were waiting for test results to determine whether Ms. Morin had contracted the coronavirus. It had been a month since the family’s last visit, so they were not worried about being infected themselves. Ms. de los Angeles said she simply needed to know.

“I still question what’s going on in that nursing home,” Ms. de los Angeles said. “They gown up. They wear masks. But the virus is still making its way around"

I live in a pretty small city, by Chinese standards, 4 million+

We had 5 people get infected. They've all gotten better. And we have had zero cases since then. 

The virus here has mostly been boring. Weeks and weeks of sitting in your house. The only thing that was open were grocery stores and convenience stores - a lot of people were panick buying food stuffs, but there wad never any shortage. 

Thankfully, the beer never ran dry. This disease has not neen good for my liver. 

Now things are opening back up. 

Everyone wears a mask. Everyone. And the quarantine was taken very seriously. 

Maybe it is because of the government. When the government gets serious about something like this, you just don't fuck around. The hammer will come down. 

But I think the mentality is way different here too. People quarantined themselves, Fast. And they didn't need a carrot or a stick, they take plagues pretty fucking seriously. 
Also, public shaming is still a thing here. It has been part of their culture for centuries.

We assessed transmission reduction potential provided by personal respirators, surgical masks and home-made masks when worn during a variety of activities by healthy volunteers and a simulated patient.

Principal Findings

All types of masks reduced aerosol exposure, relatively stable over time, unaffected by duration of wear or type of activity, but with a high degree of individual variation. Personal respirators were more efficient than surgical masks, which were more efficient than home-made masks. Regardless of mask type, children were less well protected. Outward protection (mask wearing by a mechanical head) was less effective than inward protection (mask wearing by healthy volunteers).

Conclusions/Significance

Any type of general mask use is likely to decrease viral exposure and infection risk on a population level, in spite of imperfect fit and imperfect adherence, personal respirators providing most protection. Masks worn by patients may not offer as great a degree of protection against aerosol."

**Statement by a quarantined nurse from a northern California Kaiser facility**

*March 5, 2020*

As a nurse, I’m very concerned that not enough is being done to stop the spread of the coronavirus. I know because I am currently sick and in quarantine after caring for a patient who tested positive. I’m awaiting “permission” from the federal government to allow for my testing, even after my physician and county health professional ordered it.

I volunteered to be on the care team for this patient, who we knew was positive. I did this because I had all the recommended protective gear and training from my employer. I did this assuming that if something happened to me, of course I too would be cared for. Then, what was a small concern after a few days of caring for this patient, became my reality:
I started getting sick.

When employee health told me that my fever and other symptoms fit the criteria for potential coronavirus, I was put on a 14-day self-quarantine. Since the criteria was met, the testing would be done. My doctor ordered the test through the county.

The public county officer called me and verified my symptoms and agreed with testing. But the National CDC would not initiate testing. They said they would not test me because if I were wearing the recommended protective equipment, then I wouldn’t have the coronavirus.

What kind of science-based answer is that? What a ridiculous and uneducated response from the department that is in charge of our health in this country.

Later, they called back, and now it’s an issue with something called the “identifier number.” They claim they prioritize running samples by illness severity and that there are only so many to give out each day. So I have to wait in line to find out the results.

This is not the ticket dispenser at the deli counter; it’s a public health emergency! I am a registered nurse, and I need to know if I am positive before going back to caring for patients.

I am appalled at the level of bureaucracy that’s preventing nurses from getting tested. That is a health care decision my doctor and my county health department agree with. Delaying this test puts the whole community at risk.

I have the backing of my union. Nurses aren’t going to stand by and let this testing delay continue; we are going to stand together to make sure we can protect our patients—by being protected ourselves."

To show how skewed those numbers can be when such a large amount of cases are unresolved, the recovery rate right now is of 2.2% using the same calculations as they're doing with the mortality rate. *(130 out of 5,766)*

40 people died *yesterday* in Italy from COVID-19.  There are far fewer than 832,000 official cases.

The UW Virology department has started testing and over a couple of days ramping up their testing capacity to 1,000 tests per day. So we're now testing many more cases than we were a few days ago—it's expected that the number of confirmed cases will grow rapidly.

MORE DEATHS ARE REPORTED NEAR SEATTLE, AND THE CROWDS ARE GONE

Washington State’s death toll from the coronavirus reached 13 on Thursday, driven by an outbreak at a nursing home in the Seattle suburbs, and the state’s overall number of infections rose to 75.

Eleven of the deaths have come at EvergreenHealth Medical Center in Kirkland, near where the nursing home is located. The state has had one other person die at a different hospital and another die at home.

On Thursday, Vice President Mike Pence visited the state and met with Gov. Jay Inslee. At a news conference, the two skipped sharing a handshake and instead bumped elbows — a greeting growing in popularity in the region as people try to keep their hands clean and avoid viral spread.

“Washington State is on the front lines of the coronavirus,” Mr. Pence said. Mr. Inslee, a Democrat, praised Mr. Pence for his work assisting the state, while Mr. Pence said the full resources of the federal government would be brought to help combat the coronavirus.

As government leaders in the region have taken escalating action to contain the crisis, public spaces in the region have emptied out. Seattle’s notorious traffic all but vanished, and the few cars on the highways raced along unimpeded.

In the South Lake Union area, where thousands of people work for tech companies and parking is usually a challenge, spaces were easy to find. One ride-share driver reported that her income has dropped by half since a week ago.Amazon and Microsoft, which both call the region home, have encouraged employees to work from home.

Government officials have recommended that older people also stay away from public places. One school district, Northshore, has announced that schools will be closed for two weeks and that staff will work to educate students remotely."

> The way coronavirus tests are being done is called a “test of cure” — a patient gets tested repeatedly until they consistently show negative results. This is also the way TB patients get tested before they can be released from isolation, Wroblewski said. This kind of testing is more difficult than, say, a more clear-cut flu test, especially when it’s being done for an emerging infectious disease whose behavior is still a bit of a mystery.  “Normally when you test someone for flu, it’s diagnostic — if it’s negative, it’s negative,” she said. “You’re not going to get these serial tests to get cleared. When you’re in containment phase and you’re trying to isolate people who might be transmitting the virus, you’re using diagnostic tests very differently than you do under normal circumstances. It’s challenging.”"

You could get infected with two strands of coronavirus

A new research paper says the new coronavirus has two distinct strains — and it's possible to be infected with both at the same time.

The study, which looked at 103 genomes of SARS-CoV-2, found the virus had evolved into two separate strains, known as ""S"" and ""L"".

The ""S"" type is older and seems to be milder, while the newer, more prevalent ""L"" type is more aggressive.

Viruses are known for constantly mutating — in fact, these mutations are so rapid that scientists can use them to trace where in the world patients might have picked up the virus — but these two types are so distinct they are classed into two strains.

Not only do these two strains exist, but it's possible to be infected with both at the same time. A male patient on the Gold Coast here in Australia ""might have been infected by at least two different strains"", the authors of the research paper wrote."

2020-03-05,One_Curious_Jay,Coronavirus,22,https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/fe2miv/the_coronavirus_by_the_numbers_a_mathematician/fjldmrl/,"Adam  Kucharski studies how diseases spread, but he’s not handling viruses in  the lab or treating sick people in the hospital. He’s a mathematician at the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine, and he uses  math to understand outbreaks of diseases like Ebola, SARS, influenza and  now Covid-19. His goal is to design better ways to control outbreaks.

In  a recent experiment for the 100th anniversary of the 1918 flu, he  worked with another mathematician and BBC presenter, Hannah Fry, of  University College London, to create a documentary, “Contagion: The BBC  Four Pandemic,” using a phone app to track social contacts and map how  an infection might spread.

The news of  coronavirus epidemics around the world involves a flood of numbers that  are a challenge for any nonscientist to digest. I asked Dr. Kucharski  to help us navigate some of these numbers, and to tell us which ones we  should pay attention to. We talked on the phone and corresponded by  email this week. This is an edited version of our back and forth.

**We hear a lot about the percentage of sick people who are dying. Is that the case fatality rate?**

The case fatality rate measures the risk that someone who develops symptoms will eventually die from the infection.

**And how is that rate calculated?**

Ideally,  we would monitor a large group of people from the point at which they  develop symptoms until they later die or recover, then calculate the  proportion of all these cases who had died.

**So can we just look at the total number of deaths and the current number of cases?**

The  problem with just dividing the total number of deaths and total number  of cases is that it doesn’t account for unreported cases or the delay  from illness to death. The delay is crucial: If 100 people arrive at  hospital with Covid-19 on a given day, and all are currently still  alive, it obviously doesn’t mean that the fatality rate is 0 percent. We  need to wait until we know what happens to them eventually.

Any deaths  will be people who got sick two to three weeks ago, so it’s not simply  deaths at the moment divided by cases at the moment. Plus some cases  might be missed: If you have two deaths from two cases, as happened in  Iran last month, that most likely means you’ve missed a bunch of cases.

**We’ve seen all sorts of numbers for fatality rates. Does the latest estimate of 3.4 percent globally make sense?**

Early  on, people looked at total current cases and deaths, which, as I said,  is a flawed calculation, and concluded that the case fatality rate must  be 2 percent based on China data. If you run the same calculation on  yesterday’s totals for China, you get an apparent CFR (case fatality  rate) of near 4 percent. People are speculating that something is  happening with the virus, where it actually is just this statistical  illusion that we’ve known about from Day 1. I’d say on best available  data, when we adjust for unreported cases and the various delays  involved, we’re probably looking at a fatality risk of probably between  maybe 0.5 and 2 percent for people with symptoms.

I had a [short Twitter thread explaining this (and predicting the rise) a couple of weeks ago](https://twitter.com/AdamJKucharski/status/1229708001243795458?s=20)

**What  about another number we hear about all the time, R, the reproductive  number, or how many people a given patient is likely to infect. Why is  it important and what goes into calculating it?**

At  its simplest, R is the answer to the question: How worried should we be  about infection? If R is above one, each case, on average, is giving it  to at least one other person. You’re going to see growth.

If  it’s less than one, then a group of infected people are generating less  infection. From a policy-planning point of view, it gives you a very  clear objective. For example, in the Ebola response in 2014, it was a  really prominent part of the response. The aim was to get R below one.

**That  seems very simple and straightforward, but you write that it’s more  complicated than it seems. In your book you say that to calculate R  you’ve got to know duration, opportunity, transmission probability and  susceptibility (the “DOTS”). Let’s take them one by one. What is  duration?**

How long someone is  infectious. If someone is infectious twice as long, then that’s twice  as long that they are around to spread infection.

**Do we know what the duration is for this coronavirus?**

On  average, we’d probably be looking at a week or two. Of course, if  people get hospitalized, then they’re not in the community spreading  infection in the same way.

**The second component is opportunity. How do you determine that?**

That’s  a measure of how many people you come into contact with for every day  you’re infectious. With something like flu, you’re not infectious very  long but a lot of your interactions could potentially spread it. Whereas  with something like HIV, the duration is much longer but the number of  sexual partners you have relative to the number of conversations you  have is obviously much lower.

**And transmission probability?**

This  is a measure of the chance the infection will get across during an  interaction. For example, during a sexual encounter, the virus won’t  necessarily get across.

**Finally there’s susceptibility. How do you determine that?**

Susceptibility  measures the chance the person at the other end of the interaction will  pick up the infection and become infectious themselves.

**Once you’ve got numbers for these four components, what’s the equation to come up with R?**

If  you multiply them together, you get the reproduction number. So if you  scale up or scale down any one of these things, it directly affects the  value of R.

**How does this knowledge help public health planning?**

Generally,  susceptibility is the easiest one to reduce if we have things like  vaccines. If we don’t, then we have to think about targeting the other  aspects of transmission, such as reducing opportunities through social  distancing, or probability of transmission during things like handshakes  by encouraging hand washing.

**What if you’re not in public health, but are thinking about your own personal chances and what your behavior should be?**

If  you imagine you’ve got a reproduction number of two, each person’s  infecting two others, on average. But some situations are more likely to  spread infection than others. We’ve found for things like Covid-19,  it’s close-knit interactions that seem to be most important.

What  we need to think about — and what a lot of our modeling is certainly  thinking about — is not just how much transmission is happening, but  where is that transmission happening. If you’re going to change your  behavior, think how to reduce those risky situations as much as  possible.

**If you were the average person, what would you pay attention to — in terms of the news and the numbers?**

One  signal to watch out for is if the first case in an area is a death or a  severe case, because that suggests you had a lot of community  transmission already. As a back of the envelope calculation, suppose the  fatality rate for cases is about 1 percent, which is plausible. If  you’ve got a death, then that person probably became ill about three  weeks ago. That means you probably had about 100 cases three weeks ago,  in reality. In that subsequent three weeks, that number could well have  doubled, then doubled, then doubled again. So you’re currently looking  at 500 cases, maybe a thousand cases.

I  think the other thing that people do need to pay attention to is the  risk of severe disease and fatality, particularly in older groups, in  the over-70s, over-80s. Over all we’re seeing maybe 1 percent of  symptomatic cases are fatal across all ages. There’s still some  uncertainty on that, but what’s also important is that 1 percent isn’t  evenly distributed. In younger groups, we’re talking perhaps 0.1  percent, which means that when you get into the older groups, you’re  potentially talking about 5 percent, 10 percent of cases being fatal.

In thinking about social behavior and thinking about your interactions,  the question should be, “How do we stop transmission getting into those  groups where the impact could be really severe?”"

So far, reports out of Italy say 10% of cases need ICU.  In China it was 5% of cases.

Consider that the US has 70k ICU beds.  Using China's 5% ICU rate, our ICU bed capacity gets exceeded with just  .5% of the population infected. (and btw, most of those beds are currently occupied by other patients not related to COVID-19)."

Trump also says that almost all the cases were from overseas. Some people think that is ridiculous because the U.S. only tested people who came in from outside the country and didn't even allow sampling of local viral pneumonia cases. 

However, this ignores the stable genius of Trump, who is well-versed in quantum mechanics. According to the principle of Schrödinger's virus, if we don't observe local transmission of the virus and its infection chains, then the possible patients and the all-important stock market remain in a live/dead superposition. Thus, by delaying the rollout of corona virus tests by almost three months, we won't observe a pandemic and can confidently state that the ""all the experts tell me the risk is low"" and we can look forward to April when the pandemic miraculously disappears as a result of Mike Pence's fervent prayer and obfuscation."

We Spoke to Six Americans With Coronavirus

It is one thing to be sick. It is another not to know your chances of getting well. Americans who have had the virus share their experiences.


Text messages exchanged between Dale Grizzle and John Haering while they were hospitalized separately in Japan.

By Amy Harmon

March 5, 2020, 2:51 p.m. ET

Late one night, after a test confirmed the stealth invasion of his cells by the new coronavirus, Dale Grizzle was seized with a violent fit of vomiting in his hospital room.
Until then, Mr. Grizzle, 69, of Rydal, Ga., had maintained his trademark good spirits. Like most people who have contracted the virus, he had experienced mostly mild symptoms. 

But in that moment, Mr. Grizzle, a retired house painter with 13 grandchildren, found himself unable to fend off the darkness. “I got to thinking about, ‘Is my life going to end here?’” he recalled in a recent interview. “‘Is this going to be it?’ I had severe anxiety.”


Anxiety is exactly what many Americans are feeling as a virus that has infected nearly 100,000 people and claimed more than 3,000 lives across the world over the last eight weeks finds its first footholds in the United States. With health officials preparing the public for a widespread outbreak here, six Americans who have already tested positive for the virus spoke to The New York Times about its predictable and unexpected consequences.



Some, like Mark Jorgensen, 55, of St. George, Utah, have experienced no physical discomfort from Covid-19, as the disease brought on by the virus is known. Others cannot shake its signature symptoms, such as Carl Goldman and his two-week-old cough.
Isolated in hospital rooms, quarantine units or their own homes, some early Covid-19 patients turned to prayer or meditation. Many expressed new appreciation for FaceTime and other video-call apps that let them stay connected to loved ones. And some found comfort among other members of the fast-expanding group of Americans in similar straits.



With a potentially fatal virus hijacking their respiratory tract, small pleasures, like tasting a favorite food or catching a glimpse of a family pet, took on heightened meaning. The notion of communal responsibility for public health gained new resonance. And some who divulged their disease to friends or clients had an inkling that it could become a new marker of identity. “They go, ‘Hey, I know someone with coronavirus!’ Like it’s a badge of honor,” noted Rick Wright, of Redwood City, Calif.



But that did not stop them from despairing over their own status as a reservoir of infection, or fearing ostracism. Nor did it make the defining uncertainty of the disease, which had never been seen in humans before it was detected in China in December, easier to bear.
They worried about dying. They worried about living, with unknown debilitating effects on their bodies. They worried about the tests required to prove that they were virus-free — the nasal swabs that made their eyes water and the throat swabs that made.

It is one thing to be sick. It is another not to know your chances of getting well, and to know that calculating those chances depended on how many others were sick, and to know that no one knew that, either.



Alone on that night in mid-February, Mr. Grizzle said, the fear that gripped him eased as he prayed. The next day, he texted John Haering, who, like himself, had contracted the virus on the Diamond Princess cruise ship last month as it was docked in Japan.

The two men, who had met on the ship with their wives, were among some 40 American passengers admitted to hospitals in Japan. Mr. Grizzle had been escorted off the boat on Feb. 11.


“What’s the word?” he typed to Mr. Haering two days later.
“Hey Dale,” came the reply. “In hospital too. Hate it already.”



“It’s fear, it’s every bad emotion you could have.” One woman fights to help her mother on lockdown in a virus-affected nursing home.



Before the ship entered quarantine mode, when the couples thought their cruise was coming to its regularly scheduled end, they had vowed to stay in touch.


But not until their wives were evacuated to a 14-day quarantine at a California military base while they remained hospitalized in Japan did Mr. Haering and Mr. Grizzle actually lay plans to take their families on another vacation together.



“We want to sit in the beautiful, un-diseased waters of the Caribbean,” Mr. Haering said during a joint interview with Mr. Grizzle over WhatsApp.
“We just want to float around,” Mr. Grizzle added.
It was a welcome distraction. Both men had recorded 104-degree fevers. Each received CT scans of their lungs that revealed pneumonia. Both were haunted by the death of a doctor in China who had been reprimanded for trying to alert people early on to the viral outbreak.

Mr. Haering, like Mr. Grizzle, also suffered some combination of gastrointestinal distress and existential angst. The coronavirus death rate, they knew, was about 2 percent, which sounded low. But then, the world’s case count kept mounting. So did the cruise ship’s. With over 700 infected passengers and crew members, the odds did not look as good. And they were worse for people over the age of 60.

“You start thinking, ‘Oh my gosh, do they really not know anything about this? Could I die?’” said Mr. Haering, who is 63.

Text messages Mr. Grizzle and Mr. Haering exchanged while they were treated in Japan for the coronavirus.

A recently retired operations manager for Union Pacific railroad, Mr. Haering said his fever had broken even before he reached the hospital. That soon made him eligible to take the first of two tests that would need to come back negative for the virus in order for him to leave.

“Have you ever had a nose swab?” he texted Mr. Grizzle on Feb. 21.
Mr. Grizzle, whose low-grade fever was lingering, had not. But he did have what he knew Mr. Haering craved: a hamburger. The food at their respective hospitals had provided much conversational fodder, and Mr. Grizzle had just learned how to order in. He texted back a photograph.
“I love french fries,” Mr. Haering replied, with a touch of envy. “Were they still warm? Salty, I hope.”

“Let’s live it up a little,” Mr. Grizzle replied sometime later. “Can I call?”
They celebrated the negative test result that Mr. Haering’s wife, Melanie, had received at the base in California, and the consistent reports from Mr. Grizzle’s wife, Sherry, that she had virtually no symptoms despite being hospitalized for the virus, first in San Francisco and then at a hospital in Spokane, Wash.
When Mr. Haering did get the all-clear on Saturday to return to his home in Tooele, Utah, Mr. Grizzle insisted that he was happy for his friend.

“We kind of have developed a brotherhood,” he said. “A brotherhood of the virus.”
Mr. Haering texted him a photograph of his dinner on Friday night as he awaited a flight. It included warm, salty french fries.
“Now that’s what I’m talking about!” Mr. Grizzle replied. “That’s a great-looking plate.""

No Symptoms, but Quarantined

The doctor from San Mateo County’s health department was waiting on Rick Wright’s front porch in Redwood City when the ambulance dropped him off.
From 30 feet away, the doctor indicated that Mr. Wright was to read the paperwork he had left before entering. Following instructions, Mr. Wright entered his home and called the doctor, who spoke to him from his car parked outside.
He was not to go outside. He was not to accept visitors.
The distancing protocol made sense for someone with a highly infectious disease for which there is no treatment. And Mr. Wright has tested positive for the virus three times since mid-February. First, when health officials seeking to assess the contagion on the Diamond Princess swabbed his throat and then twice more during his eight-day stay at a Northern California hospital."
