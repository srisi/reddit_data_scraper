Mohammad Haj Abolghasem, a senior commander, was known as the ‘butcher of Tehran’ for his role in the bloody suppression of pro-democracy protests that began in November 2019, the Iranian exile group said.

> Abolghasem’s Basij Forces took active part in crushing anti-regime protests. Over 1,500 Iranians were killed by the pro-regime forces during the clampdown. Basij and pro-regime forces were involved in gunning down unarmed protesters. They even used sharpshooters, as well as machine guns mounted on helicopters and pickup trucks, to shoot into crowds.

I can’t even get a call back from a nurse in my doctor’s office, let alone actually talk to the on-call doctor.  Self-isolating at home. 

I’m interested to see the details on this case.  The impression I’m getting is despite the change in CDC guidance on March 4th (saying a doctor can order a test for any patient with dry cough, fever, or breathing problems), it’s basically impossible to get tested unless you have verified contact with a confirmed case or traveled to one of the countries considered a hotspot.

An email came around from the chair yesterday saying that a commercial testing lab has come begging to the university looking for more rtPCR (real-time PCR) equipment, in order to run coronavirus tests for the state. Apparently one bottleneck now is just sufficient numbers of rtPCR machines. Anyway it turned out there has been an rtPCR sitting unused in the geneticist’s closed lab since he died, so our dept. is sending that out on loan asap (the request came in yesterday & I think the state picked it up today). So it’s gotten to the point of states contracting every commercial testing lab they can find, and those labs in turn are now going around asking universities for spare equipment.

Let me be clear that I completely disagree with this way of thinking *but* if you're really gonna take this idea into consideration, at the very least do so only after you've tried everything else. And we haven't tried everything, China did. Closing schools isn't good enough. Closing only *some* public spaces isn't good enough, especially when not much is done to enforce it and when we still have to go to work. Discouraging large gatherings of people by relying on our common sense isn't good enough because if this situation has proved anything is that we lack it. Choosing which zones to quarantine based on economics rather than actual danger isn't good enough (Milan's full infected, come on, who are they kidding). We have yet to build temporary hospitals. The ones in the South are still holding up and patients can be moved there but it's not gonna be an option for long if we keep on letting people travel from North to South and spread the virus here too. Soon even the southerns will go down and we're poorer and have less resources. 

This is not the moment for utilitarian thinking. This is the moment to do everything we can to slow this down and not crowd the hospitals, even if it includes making unpopular decisions. Even if it includes damaging the economy, something Italian politicians have always happily done anyway (not to mention that by doing fuck all to contain it, the economy will be damaged anyway eventually).

The healthcare system is ridiculously well-funded. we can run up to 12000 coronavirus tests per day as of today, but so far the number of samples to be tested is much much less than the capacity. Germany actually provides the WHO test kits for the world at least the recipes, which the USA refused to use. Most cases so far, from what I am aware of, are also in the business community rather than the elderly community. more than 60% of Germans live their lives in small villages and commute to work so spread is lower. The biggest city in the country of 80mil has only 3.5mil people and 15 cases.

I pay 270eu per month for public healthcare on a salary that is way above average, and I saw a doctor this week without an appointment within 20minutes. On the door, there was a sign warning not to enter if you suspect you have Covid. The receptionist told me not to go to the waiting room and instead go wait outside in a park and wait for a phone call - reducing the risk that someone might spread the disease in a waiting room. 

Thats why germany has succeeded, so far at least.

Every single country in the world should band together, demand all employees work from home, and ask all people over the age of 60 to stay inside while setting shopping intervals based on counties and days of the week with people in appropriate PPE / sanitation. This will allow life to mostly still continue without causing too much hysteria.

The below applies to Daegu (the epicenter of the outbreak, representing about 4/5 of all cases in SK) only. 

- Of those infected, 38.0% are in their 20s. This is a reflection of the younger demographic of the Shincheonji cult.

- 13.7% are in their 40s, and 18.3% are in their 50s

-  **only 6%** of the infected are 70+

- for reference, [here is the age distribution of South Korea ](https://www.indexmundi.com/graphs/population-pyramids/south-korea-population-pyramid-2018.jpg)

- 2/3 of the infected are women

- 3/4 of the infected in Daegu are from the Shincheonji cult.

- 1760 are hospitalized

- **Over 90% of cases are unresolved at this time.** Assuming a best case scenario where not a single additional person will be infected, a proportion of the existing cases will end in death. The CFR can only increase from here. 

- According to the WHO report, time from onset of symptoms to death ranges from **2 to 8 weeks**.

Overall, this provides a possible explanation for the relatively low mortality rate we've seen from Korea thus far. According to worldometers, women are less likely to die from COVID-19, likely correlating with a lower prevalence of vascular conditions and smoking history.

Once the number of resources for one patient would take away a resource for a less ill set of patients that would die with out the resource. 

Example
 One extremely ill patient takes 3 surgeons for 10 hours.  With out all 3 surgeons the patient will die.  Mean while 3 other patients cannot get a simple appendectomy which would only take 1 hour of time and 3 other patients cannot have a cardiac/lung/or other life saving surgery. 1 pt dies or 6 pt’s die.

  In most catastrophic situations the most injured will take too many resources from the less severe injuries that die by having to wait.  Triage in a true catastrophe requires that the sickest and with the least likely hood of surviving should only be given compassionate care in order to save many more people with a higher likely hood of survival."

2020-03-07,DocKoul,Coronavirus,52,https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/ff0jju/the_italian_society_of_anesthesia_resuscitation/fjuoz5n/,"I work as an intensive care specialist. This is a difficult situation and I’ll try to explain the thought process here. I doubt this will be limited to Italy as this progresses. 

Firstly, please understand intensive care is a limited resource - rooms, ventilators and staff are key. We can’t easily create these.

Secondly, a young person and an elderly person have VERY different trajectories once they become critically ill. Below is a generalisation, but fairly common scenario

A young person (let’s say 30-55 years) with very few medical issues becomes critically unwell and is put into an induced coma to overcome this illness. They are ventilated for a week, the endotracheal tube (breathing tube) is removed and they go to the ward for a few days to a week and make it home. This may be more or less complicated depending on complications. Staff/room/ventilator use is roughly a week. 

An elderly person (over 70- 75) with a few medical issues becomes critically ill and is put into an induced coma the same as above. Their heart doesn’t pump so well, so they end up with extra medication to support their blood pressure. They also are more likely to develop an arrhythmia (abnormal heart rhythm) and due to a heart working hard they have a small heart attack. Their kidneys don’t get the same blood flow (they don’t as well on a normal day due to age) causing fluid retention and make their lungs soggy making it harder to remove the ventilator. Their lungs don’t work overly well due to exposure to second hand smoke and just simply age related change. The medications to keep them sleeping for the ventilator cause hallucinations and delerium when they wake up. They have a lower amount of muscle than the young person and quickly waste away and become very weak in the space of a week. Two weeks on the breathing machine go by and there is a decision to do a tracheostomy (breathing tube for the neck) so they can be awake and still have the support of the ventilator. The reason they need this is because their lungs are still soggy and wet with fluid, they are too weak to breathe on their own and can’t even stand under their own power. They can’t cough well and get bacterial pneumonia on top of their viral pneumonia. They remain for another week. They finally get to the ward after nearly a month in the intensive care and into the ward. However they never recover enough to be independent and go to a nursing home. There are multiple variations here (strokes, heart failure, dialysis, pressure sores, other infections... the list is massive)

Those of us in the intensive care community are faced with this decision every day. It is our duty to protect and appropriately allocate this resource. During normal operation, if a relatively healthy 80 year old gets pneumonia and needs the support, we would admit and submit them to the treatment/torture of intensive with a hope of a good outcome (home and independent). We cannot admit hundreds of 70-80+ year olds to a tertiary hospitals with coronavirus and ventilate them for 2-3 weeks when there are hundreds of younger healthy people who need the resource. It’s an unpopular decision but it’s a medical decision. Not a government decision, not a patient decision, not a family decision (but we absolutely take all those opinions into account when making the decision). 

It is vital that the general community understands this. There is a HUGE difference between admitting a young person vs an elderly person with the same illness. 

Knowing what you know now, who would you admit to your last three ICU beds with the last three ventilators? How would you explain it to the six patients and their families?"

At the end, he was begging literally anyone to care for his son. The child died, probably from thirst. I have to assume that the other child was too young to provide his brother with water (which is also just a huge bag of exclamation and question marks). Apparently, the party official in charge was fired, although one article mentioned that they claimed that they had helped the children in some kind of way. I have to assume that if the child had been a newborn infant, it would also have been on it's own until Dad was released from quarantine.

There are great healthcare systems with largely private insurance, and great health systems with public insurance.

What is important is transitioning from fee-for-service to value-based care, and regulating prices.

Markets do not work for health care.  In almost any other part of the economy, I am a big supporter of markets.  But not healthcare.  Markets only work when there is strong competition, and consumers have enough information to assess value.

In health care, not only does the public have very little ability to assess the value of one treatment versus another, or one provide versus another, they don't even have any real information on the cost of a service until after it's been purchased, they don't even know what services are being sold to them, they often don't even directly pay for the services, usually they don't even directly pay for the insurance which pays for the services, and often they have no time to research any of this because the need for care is urgent.  This is not a fixable problem, markets are never going to work for health care.

The US highly regulates health care services and delivery, but the US is deathly afraid of price regulation.  But this is the only real solution.  Unit costs are just substantially higher in the US for every aspect of healthcare - provider payments, hospital charges, medical devices, diagnostics, and pharmaceuticals.  Insurance adds some cost, but it's much less than many assume.

The solution is to stop paying for every individual service, and instead pay for categories of treatment, and regulate those bundled prices.  This model works very well in countries like Japan."

 - The people they're treating aren't taking this seriously and are literally going out of their way to spread this (Disneyland, are you fucking serious, right now? Redditors whinging about losing $5,000, meanwhile ignorant on how many people might die because of their inability to differentiate between a *want* and a *need*).

 - The government is seemingly doing its best to keep this spreading, I mean, schools haven't even completely shut down yet, the President of all people outright denied it, and has been absolutely zero help. Not sure about this, but they probably barely have the equipment to deal with this as is, just wait a week when factories, shipping, and deliveries start shutting down. 

 - And let's not forget, it's not like we were taking great care of them in the first place. Nurses don't get paid neeeearly what they deserve, meanwhile we ask them to pull ungodly shifts while shoveling human land-masses into beds, completely ruining their back and such. They have to clean bedpans, deal with rude, ignorant patients all day who threaten, sexually harass, and fight them. We barely compensate them for this.

 These are the people we depend on to save our lives, and this is how we treat them. At some point, some people will get fed up, and offering more money short-term won't convince them this time. The reality is, (I honestly hope not), we might have a large-scale walk-out at some point.

They are not counted in the statistics and they aren't being monitored. She works for a major hospital system (but not in caregiving). They both missed work/school all of last week. They both have this crazy terrible cough, slight trouble breathing, and mild fevers that have been ongoing now for a little over a week. The symptoms have neither worsen or improved.

Today we found out that this cough she and my daughter haven't been able to get rid of probably came from a co-worker that went on a trip with another guy who had just come back from China. They both eventually had pneumonia of unknown cause and the timing of the onset of symptoms fits with the reported 5 to 6-day average.

She gets ahold of her boss that is an active ER doctor and he told her that their symptoms sound exactly like SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19 and that they should immediately self-quarantine, but she shouldn't expect to get tested. At the moment, only those who are bad enough to be hospitalized or have had contact with someone officially diagnosed is being tested.

So if what we believe is true and they have this, there is a chance that I and my other kids have it as well, asymptomatically. I have spent the past two weeks in various meetings at both of my kid's schools. I've been shaking hands with educators, caseworkers, and everyone else I've run into, bought groceries from, etc.

So, Vice President Generic White Politician #9368, tell me again how there is nothing to worry about here because I can't imagine a situation where we are the only family potentially walking around unknowingly with this virus and disease for over a week.

This started yesterday. I work with immune compromised patients everyday and I don’t want to get vulnerable populations sick. 

They said I don’t meet criteria for testing and to just follow normal protocol for feeling sick and going to work. I don’t have a fever and would probably normally wear a mask when in patient areas and suck it up and work. We are short staffed and are not encouraged to take care of ourselves when we are sick. It’s very upsetting that I can’t know if I have an innocuous cold or something that could literally kill patients. I only have so much sick time and just think they are putting millions of people in a horrible bind of not knowing what to do. Carry on with life as normal or lock yourself in your house using all your sick time for what could be a cold. It’s really troubling."

Messaging about masks is so off-point. They should be truthful:

\-Masks can work. These are the different types of masks, and most importantly, here's how to use them correctly.  
\-We don't have enough for everyone, please don't stockpile them so doctors can use them, because we need the doctors healthy for the good of us all.  
\-We also need them for the sick, so they don't spread around the virus as easy. That helps us all and reduces all of our risk.  
\-Masks help, but they also shouldn't make you feel you're invulnerable. If you do use them, still avoid high-risk situations.

Instead you get confusing, simplistic messaging that makes people confused and angry. I know people are stupid, but we can run through a few points instead of saying, ""They don't work, don't get them, other people need them."" It just instills distrust and panic."

Nursing needs are routinely ignored in favor of hospital profits even when it affects patient outcomes. I am so proud of National Nurses United for their relentless advocacy for nurses. They are definitely the best nursing organization. 

I  walked out of nursing completely in January because of how unsafe the environment for patients & nurses has become. It was absolutely gut wrenching knowing that your patients are suffering and you are not enabled to properly care for them. I worked in the best hospital in the world for years that actually cared about the safety of patient and nurse alike and I would have stayed in the profession if my personal life did not dictate a move away from where that hospital was located. I am not alone in leaving the profession. There are 3.8 million nurses in the US with only about 85% working as nurses.

The big picture: A truly global infectious disease event like COVID-19 can be every bit as transformative for the future as a global war or economic depression.

The impacts of major pandemics can be felt well beyond the sheer death toll.

* The Black Death, which killed as much as a third of Europe's population during the 14th century, led to severe labor scarcity. The resulting higher wages helped erode feudalism and encouraged the innovation of labor-saving technologies.

* More recently the 2003 SARS outbreak helped jumpstart China's nascent e-commerce sector.

What to watch: How lasting the changes created by COVID-19 will be depends on the extent of the virus's spread and its ultimate severity, neither of which can be known yet. But the longer the outbreak endures, the more likely it is that coping responses will remain with us.

/ 1. **Going remote**: Videoconferencing and remote work have exploded as the virus has spread.

* According to Kentik, a global provider of network analytics, videoconferencing traffic in North America and Asia has doubled since the outbreak began.

* Led by tech firms like Twitter and Facebook, companies are encouraging and even requiring their employees to work from home, both to slow the spread of the disease now and prepare for the worst should offices be closed in a quarantine.

* Many experts believe business leaders will come to see that central offices and face-to-face meetings are less vital than they thought. ""We're going to see that work can be tied to productivity anywhere rather than putting time in an office,"" said Peter Jackson, CEO of the digital collaboration company Bluescape.

/ 2. **The big decoupling**: After the travel industry, the companies that have suffered most from COVID-19 are those with just-in-time supply chains highly dependent on China.

* As a result, the coronavirus has already ""prompted a re-examination of the world's central reliance on China as ground zero for manufacturing,"" as Peter Goodman wrote in the New York Times.

* If the outbreak worsens, ""we'll definitely see accelerated decoupling of manufacturing out of China,"" said Ian Bremmer, president of Eurasia Group. ""Changes that may have been delayed until the next recession will happen right now.""

/ 3. **Nastier politics**: The ideal reaction to a global outbreak would be a globally unified response. Don't bet on it.

* Far-right leaders in countries like France, Italy and Spain have already taken advantage of the outbreak to call for tightening borders. As a result, wrote Pawell Zerka of the European Council on Foreign Relations, ""populism could flourish as the coronavirus spreads.""

* COVID-19 has already become politicized in the U.S. According to one online survey, nearly 70% of Republicans believe the nation is prepared for the outbreak, compared to just 35% of Democrats.

* While China badly mismanaged the start of the outbreak, more recently the country has tried to spin its apparent success in containing the virus as a triumph of its autocratic system. Expect that argument to gain force if the U.S. bungles its response.

/ 4. **Faster science**: While governments have struggled to respond to COVID-19, scientists are making the most of new tools to track and potentially counter the virus.

* Rapid analyses of the genetic makeup of the virus in Washington state indicated the outbreak there was likely underway well before the first official cases were confirmed in late January.

* Scientists at Stanford University developed a diagnostic test for the novel coronavirus that can deliver tests in as little as 12 hours, much faster than current models.

The bottom line: The year is less than three months old, but we have every reason to believe that COVID-19 will be one of the most significant events of the decade — if not beyond."

I have been having arguments with literal morons who think that because there are all these undiscovered cases all over the place that the mortality rate will go down so no big deal.

Then you try to help them understand how just because the mortality rate goes down doesn't mean the death count does when you start realizing 0.2% mortality rate of 2 billion cases over a year is exponentially greater than 4% of 100,000 cases.

It's amazing. The CDC, the WHO, the states of New York, Washington and California have declared states of emergency and these people will just say they don't believe it. End of story.

SC, by the way, is the 50th state out of 50 for education. I believe Puerto Rico has better public education.

You can’t save 99.5% without proper medical treatment. Which we won’t have considering the number of available beds needed to properly treat."

We do have the full blown hazmat type gear here as well but there's little point to it with coronavirus, it goes in through your mucosal surfaces so you're mainly trying to protect your eyes, nose, and mouth.

The actual problem is that there isn't anywhere near enough gear in US hospitals, so hospitals are rationing this gear in a way that's making it very hard to actually protect yourself when you're going to see a patient who may or may not have it. And the lack of any way to actually test for it makes this even more problematic.

Our testing abilities should be getting MUCH better this week, I'm not sure what the timeline is to actually get protective equipment into everyone's hands though-all the hospitals have ordered millions of dollars of PPE but who knows how long it'll take.

They're making people re-use disposable N95 masks now to try and make what we have left last longer."

After the leak, trains, buses, cars and planes also left packed for Switzerland, France and basically all other EU/Schengen countries? That’s a lot of people to contain and quarantine. But I agree it makes little difference today. But that is just because the quarantine is to late. It should have happened over a week ago, when Italy created a small red zone, while countries elsewhere where reporting cases linked only to Milan, Bergamo or mountain resorts, far from said zone. Don’t get me wrong, i’m not criticizing Italy itself, they were just unlucky with the spread. But the government acted way to late. And I’m nit basing my opinion on cases (as in testing issues) but rather on deaths and ICU patients (overwhelmed ICUs), as that is a clearer sign."
