Modern civilization is interconnected -- not only between countries, but far-flung industries.

China isnt manufacturing. Wuhan handles 1.5 million shipping containers a year. Two billion tons of cargo flow through Wuhan's port. Any country, major supplier or company that sources goods or coal, crude oil, steel, or fertilizer is royally fucked. Travel and jet fuel companies already feel it. Major shipping companies have already announced blank sailings.

Best case, pie-in-the-sky scenario is that we go back to BAU next week which still means significantly higher prices for any country that is a China trade partner. . . basically most of the civilized world.

Wrap your head around that. This will hit every nation in two months time because that's how long it takes to move through the system. The longer the shut down, the greater the pain. Even if they resumed today, it would still cause problems. We are talking at least a month of disruption in the supply chain.

This affects retailers around the globe (Amazon, Wal-Mart, Target) in addition to shipping companies (and UPS, DHL, FedEx), plus every other company that services those accounts. Every airline with routes to SE Asia is screwed. Every company that services those airlines, especially jet fuel suppliers, is screwed. This could very well push us into a global depression or collapse. There isn't any way to fix this either because no one can just step in and pick up the slack.

Imagine if Amazon stopped all business for one month. Think about all the companies that would go under because they are wholly dependant on Amazon for the lion share of their sales, or processing of payments, etc. Now think how long it would take one company to recover from that.

Got a good picture? Good, now multiply that by every major retailer, shipping, transport, electronics, travel, airline, and packaging company in the world and realize there is no alternative for them. They can't buy parts or product anywhere else in any remotely sizable volume. Consider all the countries selling raw materials to China. Hell, we won't be able to manufacture medical equipment without components if and when governments start building hospitals.

So when you say ""maybe in Wuhan"" understand that those 1.5 million shipping containers are not going on to ships, not being loaded onto trucks, not being delivered to manufacturers, not being stocked in retailer's warehouses, and not hitting your store shelves."

The general thought is that you have to be within 2m of an infected person to catch the virus. The latest information from China is saying different. It’s able to spread much further in the air. The Doctor didn’t give any figures but I suspect 2m is a huge under estimate. He as also worked out for 10000 people infected some 10% (1000) could develop a more serious condition.

Is this just a form of denial mixed with, frankly, racism, or is there any virus anywhere that affects one national/ethnic group more than others?

I understand that through population genetic effects or exposure history one group may be more susceptible to disease than others, e.g. when Columbus landed in the Americas and a huge percentage of natives died. But that was 500 years ago, inter-hemisphere travel was non-existent (hence the problem), and we have not had a chance to see how this virus behaves in the large outside of China (yet).

He is the most gentle creature and my only friend. 

And honestly.... Today I’ve been here thinking. Do i call a vet if i think i have it and have the virus and have him respectfully put down so he does not suffer starvation or worse become a stray? 

Would anyone care for him and i already know that answer is no if it has become that bad. 
Do i call the vet and ask fir advice for something i can buy and have sent to me if it comes to this in our country? 
God, I’m sobbing even thinking about this. I cant bare to even imagine having him put down or if he’s alone starving. 
 This little cat is innocent just as my family and i could not imagine my soul being good if i left him to suffer because i was taken away or if i died on him. No vet would come to an infected house.

It is unclear how many are currently infected. Not only because the numbers from China are inherently unreliable (lets not forget that China deliberately drove sick SARS patients around in ambulances to hide them from the World Health Organization back in 2003), but even if you trust China’s data it is clear they are hitting the limits of their testing capacity.
Officially, just over 40,000 people have been confirmed to be infected with the virus in China. However a study in the Lancet estimated back on January 25th that 75,000 people had already been infected and that the virus was doubling every 6.4 days — which would suggest that more than 300,000 people may now be infected with the virus. But no one knows the true number. Probably not even President Xi.
Even outside of China the numbers are unclear. The head of the WHO tweeted today that we may only be seeing the tip of the iceberg of infected cases:

It is unclear how exactly contagious the virus is.There is still a large range of possible R-nought values for the virus. The R-nought (R0) value, is a measure of how transmissible a disease is, it shows how many people each infected person infects in turn. Most estimates have put the R0 value between R2 and R4 (meaning that each infected person infects 2–4 other people). This is fairly high and does not bode well for hopes of containing the virus. But, it’s also still unclear if China has been able to lower the average transmission rate with their draconian lockdown and quarantine of entire cities.
Perhaps most crucially at this point, it is unclear what the mortality rate of the virus is. Estimates seem to range between 1% and 5%. But it is honestly impossible to determine the mortality rate at this point for a number of reasons.
Firstly, because it’s totally unclear how many people have been infected with only mild symptoms. If a million people have already been infected, the vast majority may never see severe symptoms and the mortality rate may be quite low. However, it’s also unclear if the deaths in China are being fully counted. There are many reports about patients dying before being tested and the deaths not counting on the official totals. We will have to wait to get a clear picture of the mortality rate.
That being said, Hubei province released their official fatality rates yesterday and some cities had rates as high as 4% and 5%. Although this number is fairly meaningless in objective terms for the reasons outlined above, it is telling that these rates are much higher than the official rates in other regions of China and suggests that the mortality rate may rise significantly if the healthcare system becomes overwhelmed as it has in these hardest hit regions of China. This is troubling given the WHO has stated that 15% of patients developed pneumonia and 3–5% required intensive care. Moreover, reportedly the virus does serious damage to people’s lower respiratory systems — supposedly it can take “…at least six months for patients to recover heart and lung function.” If this becomes endemic across the world, even developed nation’s healthcare systems will struggle to provide care.
Mortality Rate Based on Data Outside Mainland China
If we calculate the case fatality rate (CFR) based on the limited data outside of mainland china, we can arrive at our own — very tentative — fatality rate.
Outside of mainland China there have been 461 confirmed cases of coronavirus. Of these cases only 46 have been resolved. 44 cases recovered, and 2 died.
Using these numbers we would arrived at a case fatality rate of:
(2 * 46 )/100 = 4.34%
Obviously, there is too little data for this calculation to be meaningful, but this is the metric that should be watched if you do not trust the numbers coming out of china.
The Economic Impact
Even if the virus can be contained in China, the impact may be devastating for the economy of the country.
One thing that we do know about the outbreak is the unprecedented and draconian measures the Chinese government has taken to slow the spread of the virus. Some 400 million Chinese are now under some form of quarantine across China — in some of the most economically important regions of the country.

Red areas under some form of lockdown. Source: Wuhan Coronavirus Map by Fuuuuuuu · MapHub
Factories are shut down, inflation has already surged to an 8 year high(with food price inflation at 20.6%), and some economists are already predicting that China’s GDP growth will fall to 0% for the next quarter. And the economic damage will increase exponentially if the quarantines are maintained for much longer. To quote an excellent piece from The Telegraph:
…the more thoroughly China enforces this, the greater the global economic shock is likely to be. How can industrial plants really be reopened next week? Yet if it takes another month, it becomes progressively harder to contain the international economic damage, and raises the risk of a Minsky Moment within China’s own hyper-leveraged system keeps rising.
Possible Outcomes
Essentially we don’t know enough hard facts about the virus and China’s success (or failure) in containing the virus to predict the impact on the world.
However, we should be able to make some reasonable predictions within the next 3–4 weeks. By then we should get a better idea of the case fatality rate from cases outside mainland china. We’ll also be able to see if the virus continues to spread around the world over the next month despite china’s draconian quarantine measures.
A wide range of scenarios are plausible at this point of the outbreak. Everything from from slightly worse than the typical flu — to something on par with World War II. You could make a case that the mortality rate is likely to be on par with the seasonal flu — and anyway China is likely to contain the virus. Or, you could make the case that there’s some very troubling initial data coming out of China and the communist government is certainly going to unrepresented lengths (at a great economic cost) to try to contain the outbreak.
Case 1 — The Optimistic Scenario
In the optimistic scenario, a month from now we can calculate, from data outside mainland china, that the CFR is perhaps .3% or below. Moreover, the spread of the virus outside mainland china will stabilize and we will not see additional community spread in other countries. This would be a good indication that China’s containment measures worked at the R0 value has fallen to 1 or bellow.
In this case China will probably make a quick economic recovery, and the virus will be on par with the H1N1 (Swine flu) pandemic of 2009.
Case 2 — Pandemic with Low CFR
In the case two scenario we will be able to calculate that the CFR of the virus is fairly low. Somewhere between .1 % and 1%.
However, the virus is not contained to China and we see sustained community spread in multiple countries outside of China.
This means that the virus would spread — but it would be about as bad as the flu or perhaps 10X as bad as the flu. At the low range of this the economy would make a fairly quick recovery and at the high range it could be a moderate drag on global growth.
Case 3 — Pandemic with Moderate CFR
In this scenario the virus in not contained within China — and the CFR is somewhere around 2%. Anecdotally this appears to be the current base case assumption among the experts.
The closest historical analogy to this would be the 1918 influenza pandemic. This would almost certainly had a fairly large economic impact, hospitals might be overwhelmed, people would be wearing masks on the street. Millions could die in the United States and other developed countries.
Case 4 — Worst Case Scenario. Pandemic with High CFR.
In the worst case scenario the virus is not contained in China, and it in ends up having a CFR or somewhere between 3%–7%. Maybe the fatality rate is slightly worse than we hope — and healthcare systems become overwhelmed causing the mortality rate to rise substantially. In that case this is The Big One."

No matter what happens, the world keeps spinning. We're all going to die some day, whether it's because of some virus from halfway around the world, or old age, or a car accident, or a ham sandwich. Time stops for no one, not presidents, not kings, not emperors, not me, not you.

Worrying about this to an extent that you're wracked with anxiety does nothing but take away from your ability to enjoy each new day as it comes by. Being prepared is good, and it sounds like you've done what you can. Now you can take the Gestalt approach and observe life as it is; the macro instead of the micro. Find some music that you love to listen to, or go for a hike. Take in the beauty and the scenery. Remind yourself that it will be there tomorrow and the next day.

Remember that you can die two deaths from this thing: when this virus stops your heart, it stops you from breathing; but this virus also kills you when it takes over your life and makes it devoid of joy and meaning. Don't let it do that. Inoculate yourself by living now, and by experiencing life as it is."

The reality is the TSA does fuck all except rummage around our bags occasionally. I think the TSA have stopped exactly 0 terrorist attacks since it's inception. They're there as a deterrent at most, not an actual solution to stopping a determined enemy of the state. Same with the police, they respond to a fraction of the actual crime that occurs around the country. They're just there to keep the rest of society in line.

The problem is the US is applying this same logic to stopping nCoV. nCoV is not a sentient being. It does not get intimidated by thermometer checks/quarantine checks/virus checks. Even if you stop 75% of the suspected cases, there's still 25% leaking into the rest of the country where they will sit and fester. 

This is a virus, it will continue to hurl bodies at these check points until something gets through. Once that happens we're fucked. And that's assume this hasn't already repeatedly happened by now."

But I'd say the same of the Swiss Alps and they have an outbreak of the coronavirus there now, and they're having to test schoolchildren because one confirmed case was in a school-aged child. Honestly, I really think if you have family in a safe rural area and you don't have your dream job/gf to give up, then I'd go there now, if I were you, for a few weeks, maybe. Call it a vacation. Give your roommate a couple of weeks and keep in touch by Skype to see if she gets sick. Only because with this kind of thing, by the time you get confirmation that it's bad enough to run away, that's when it's usually too late to run away. No countries who rely on tourism for their economic survival, or even just stability, are reporting real numbers. They're not testing in ways that would catch asymptomatic carriers who are in the incubation phase but contagious nevertheless, as a way of keeping numbers low. I suspect they're all hoping it's going to be mild and manageable, and the deaths will be among the sick elderly who, sadly, are seen as using up a large portion of countries' healthcare funding, in many countries (look up unfunded pension liabilities if you're skeptical of the resentment some bureaucrats might have towards seniors).

A little while ago, people were saying it was stupid to buy masks, that it was paranoia to stock up on them. Now they're sold out all over and governments themselves don't have enough if things get bad. Chinese nurses are complaining that hospitals have run out of masks and they're having to work without them.

Epidemiology is a fascinating field, and sometimes just eliminating main sources of transmission without entirely eliminating them, can do a virus in. 

Again, it really depends on the virus, but sometimes risk reduction goes a very long way. Imagine if the virus is sensitive to seasonal changes and declines in the summer. Quarantines and containment could buy us some time, allowing us to develop treatments before the next wave comes.

It's hard to say, but long story short, it could make a big difference."

5. Hospitals will be overloaded.

I think we’ve identified some fatal flaws with our way of thinking in regards to humanitarian issues in general in our society and I hope we can course correct before something really serious DOES happen. It’s also my belief that those of us who have experienced real violence are the ones who want to promote it the least. And because life is so “easy” these days those works of fiction really do guide our mentalities a lot of the time. People don’t quite understand what a panic situation is like and I truly don’t think a single person would enjoy living through it. I know at the end of the day we as a species will be fine but it bothers me to no end how we consistently place human lives below that of our standards of comfort. These things happen in spite of that however, and SHOULD act as a guidepost for our morality. Time will be the judge of whether or not that’s the case. I hope it is."

The thing is, this is a Novel Virus, which means it's something NEW that no human system has ever experienced until now. The human form doesn't know what to do with it. You also need to read between the lines in his videos. He is very professional and will not come out and say anything like ""don't trust what the WHO says"" but instead, he gives you the break down of what's going on.  


I highly recommend educating yourself on this through his videos. Sometimes fear will cause a person to shut down and they deny there is a problem. It won't hurt to gain some education and then possibly make a new decision for yourself re: whether or not you truly are an invincible human being, or not.

That doesn't mean word of some suspected cases (probably through word of mouth) won't get into the news, but the State is not releasing that info to the public.

IMHO this is negligent behavior by our local governments.  People's lives could be at risk due to a lack of information transparency during a public health crisis."

a) you believe it's widespread - the fact that hospitals outside hubei aren't flooded with pneumonia patients means it does in fact have a severity profile in-line with the flu  

b) it's not widespread - then the shoe hasn't dropped yet - and containment procedures are actually working or it isn't as contagious as has been suggested

Which do you believe?

If you want my opinion:

I believe a) because it seems like so few people are actually getting tested, and where I live random people with no connection to China or previous cases are getting diagnosed (e.g. taxi driver, cafe worker)

That said I'm concerned by global data outside China that so few have recovered in sense of testing negative for the disease yet... so even if get mild symptoms does the disease stay in your system a long time?"

LUSAKA, Zambia — At a Chinese-run hospital in Zambia, some employees watched as people who recently returned from China showed up with coughs but were not placed in isolation. A doctor tending to those patients has stopped coming to work, and health workers have been ordered not to speak publicly about the new virus that has killed hundreds around the world.

The virus that has [spread through much of China](https://www.statnews.com/2020/01/30/who-declares-coronavirus-outbreak-a-global-health-emergency/) has yet to be confirmed in Africa, but global health authorities are increasingly worried about the threat to the continent where an estimated 1 million Chinese now live, as some health workers on the ground warn they are not ready to handle an outbreak.

Countries are [racing to take precautions](https://www.statnews.com/2020/02/07/hospitals-harnessing-resources-brace-spike-coronavirus-cases/) as hundreds of travelers arrive from China every day. Safeguards include stronger surveillance at ports of entry and improved quarantine and testing measures across Africa, home to 1.2 billion people and some of the world’s weakest systems for detecting and treating disease.

But the effort has been complicated by a critical shortage of testing kits and numerous illnesses that display symptoms similar to the flu-like virus.

“The problem is, even if it’s mild, it can paralyze the whole community,” said Dr. Michel Yao, emergency operations manager in Africa for the World Health Organization.

Those growing worried include employees at the Sino-Zambia Friendship Hospital in the mining city of Kitwe in northern Zambia, near the Congo border. Chinese companies operate mines on the outskirts of the city of more than half a million people. One company is headquartered in Wuhan, the city at the center of the virus outbreak. Hundreds of workers traveled between Zambia and China in recent weeks.

“We’re definitely not prepared. If we had a couple of cases, it would spread very quickly,” physiotherapist Fundi Sinkala said. “We’re doing the best we can with what resources we have.”

The Sino-Zambia Friendship Hospital, or Sinozam, a low-slung facility near the city’s train station, has taken some precautions, including checking patient temperatures with infrared thermometers and establishing isolation areas. Employees wear masks. Gloves, disinfectant and oxygen inhalers have been stockpiled. Sinozam treats many Chinese in Kitwe and its precautions go further than other hospitals in the area.

But the employees and others familiar with the matter, some of whom spoke anonymously under the new rules, say some Chinese patients checked in with coughs and fevers but did not get placed in isolation.

Visiting Zambian health officials concluded the patients did not merit special treatment and did not take samples to test for the virus. After the people recovered, they were sent home with antibiotics, employees said.

On Wednesday, the hospital set up a new fever clinic, to which people arriving with a high temperature are now ushered to right away. It’s “unfortunate” the ward wasn’t set up earlier, Sinkala said.

Two people familiar with the matter say a doctor tending to the sick has fallen ill. Dr. Yu Jianlan has not come to work in the past week and hospital administrators have not explained her absence, Sinkala said. The other person spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of retribution.

Hospital administrator Li Zhibing said there were no patients with a fever and said Yu had a urinary tract infection, not a fever. But a notice posted by the Zambia-China Cooperation Zone, which manages the hospital, quoted an employee as saying on Jan. 27 that the facility “probably sees 120 fever patients a day, and at least 70 of them are carrying germs” of various diseases.

Earlier this week, a Zambian official acknowledged for the first time that his country was following up on an unspecified number of suspected cases. Zambia is one of 13 African countries identified by WHO as a high priority because of busy travel links with China.

Copperbelt provincial health director Dr. Robert Zulu, who oversees Kitwe and the surrounding region, told The Associated Press he would not discuss details, citing privacy. But he added, “when any case is confirmed, you will be informed.”

Crucially, no one in Zambia has been able to test for the virus so far. Like most African countries, it has been waiting for a substance known as a reagent, which labs require to confirm whether a patient is infected. Labs in just six of Africa’s 54 countries were equipped as of mid-week. That means a wait of two or more days to know whether a sample shipped to South Africa or even outside the continent tests positive.

Without testing, officials are “just relying on the symptoms” and whether they persist. “But from what we are learning right now, some people show hardly any symptoms at all,” Sinkala said, calling that the hospital’s biggest worry.

Zambia is one of the additional countries WHO planned to equip by the end of the week. As of Friday, WHO emergencies chief Dr. Mike Ryan said 28 labs across the continent could diagnose the new virus.

Adding to concerns at Sinozam, three employees say Zambian health officials visited on Tuesday and have been testing the bodies of two Chinese patients that have been in the morgue for days, though some added it was out of an overabundance of caution.

Li, however, dismissed the accounts of testing the bodies as “rumors.” He said one died last month of malaria and the other of a heart attack. The bodies are still there because family members in China wish to come and pay respects but cannot because of the outbreak, he said.

Zambia’s health ministry spokesman, Dr. Abel Kabalo, called the employee accounts of events at the hospital “very strange.” He vowed that if Zambia confirms a case, authorities “will definitely inform the world.”

It’s “pointless to hide information,” Kabalo said.

The WHO says countries are obligated to inform it of any confirmed cases and are requested to report suspected cases as well. The WHO chief has publicly urged countries to share information. So far, African countries appear to be complying, a WHO adviser on health security, Dr. Ambrose Talisuna, told reporters.

Several African nations such as Ghana, South Africa and Ethiopia have announced their precautions, including updates on negative test results for suspected cases and demonstrations of surveillance and quarantine capabilities. Ethiopian Airlines, however, faces questions by some in Africa about why it continues to operate more than 30 China flights a week while other African airlines have suspended theirs.

Adding to the difficulties in diagnosing the new virus are numerous diseases in Africa with symptoms that include fever or coughing or both.

It’s impossible to diagnose the new virus by symptoms alone, Gates Foundation CEO Mark Suzman said, adding that there is a “significant likelihood” that the virus will be confirmed in Africa. And there is a risk that “panic overtakes good public health and good science.”

The foundation has committed up to $20 million to help health authorities in Africa and South Asia, another vulnerable region, improve their disease surveillance, isolation and treatment for the virus.

Concerns are high among some in Kitwe. A local pharmacy manager, Edward Goma, estimated that his business had sold more than 800 face masks in the past few days.

“So far everyone is scared,” he said. And yet he has not noticed the stricter surveillance measures seen in other countries, beyond temperature checks at the international airport an hour’s drive away.

The 15th Metallurgical Construction Group, based in Wuhan, said on its website that its overseas operations in Zambia and Congo must purchase masks, disinfect living quarters and workspaces daily and check workers’ temperatures three times a day.

Chinese employees are temporarily barred from returning to Africa, while those in Zambia are not allowed to go to China, said Li, the hospital administrator.

Chinese embassies in Zambia and elsewhere in Africa have been unusually outspoken, giving news conferences and television interviews to discuss their response to the outbreak. Embassies require arriving Chinese citizens to declare where they have been in China. They also urge citizens to voluntarily isolate themselves for 14 days.

“We are now practicing hygiene, even in the mines,” said the Kitwe-based president of the Mine Workers Union of Zambia, Joseph Chewe. “Any report of a person with coronavirus here will be very disastrous.”"

Once you have the sequence it is fairly simple to design custom reagents that will be sensitive to that sequence. I routinely make reagents for other respiratory viruses (including other corona strains) in 2000 reaction batches and I work in a fairly small lab.

That being said, I very much doubt that the testing of the deceased is as high a priority as testing the living. So in that area we may not be getting accurate figures. If someone has died I doubt that you would waste time testing them if you have living patients that you need to apply infection control measures to."

It was very stressful i was so scared i quit soon after from the fears i had from it. Honestly i got ptsd from how bad i felt in that fear for months on end it seriously took its toll and i crumbled mentally. Seeing this flare up and what i saw of SARS and i know this is a LOT worse and now not really contained- being in other countries. I am heading back to the drs today for medication to try and calm as its repeating a very scary past for me.  I know very well how fast this can go out of control and how amazing the world tried to contain the SARS outbreak once they knew. There was a lot of pressure. I’m not saying my work was mean. They handled it expertly and tactfully with respect. Just... The information was scary and very real. This virus... you would not wish on your worst enemy and at this point imo.. we will know in a month how bad this will get. Be safe ok.

80% of infected people have symptoms that could be mistaken for the normal flu, or the common cold. Those people aren't very likely to be tested, even, as we're seeing now, in severely affected areas such as Wuhan. 

We seem to be somewhat certain that the CFR is about 2% (but could be much more, or less), and death is a very obvious symptom that should require testing, so if we see X dead people, we can assume 50X ish infected.

But, there are so many factors playing into this. With limited testing kits, testing people who are dead, or can't be saved, might not be the norm everywhere.

But if I did, I would suspect an environmental group, or scientist to be behind this because this will slow down industry and consumption so much. In fact I suspect we will hear that this has helped reduce CO2 emissions massively: no one is going anywhere and tourism is getting hit really, really hard. It will make us rethink globalisation too.

The only thing we knew at the time was a surge of patients at hospitals in certain provinces in southern China. By the time China couldn't hide SARS anymore, they reported their total infected amount was like 1,500 people, which everybody knew was bullshit.

China was *insanely* poor and isolated and closed off back then. Its GDP PPP Per Capita was 2,900, around half the level of modern day Nigeria, whereas today China's level is 17,000. Its possible that 100,000 people got infected and 15,000 died from SARS in those months, we simply have zero idea because China was so closed off. Even within China, travel between provinces was far, far less common simply because people were too poor to travel. 

Today, China is much more interconnected with the global community, both on a society level and a government level. They simply cant hide things like this anymore. They also have their reputation on the line, as SARS severely damaged China's reputation, and they are desperate to avoid another situation like that."

So couponing, discounts etc are how I feed my family. I don’t go crazy and stick to the buy what we would use policy with all my shopping. I also have a terrible immune system so I shop online as much as I can, especially with risks of seasonal flu right now. and so I’m pretty used to seeing deals sell out etc. however this week when doing my normal shopping was going to pick up corn, and veggies Walmart was running a deal for some for .48 which is wicked awesome, then I had a promo code for $10 off 50. So I went online about 2am EST and buy about 60 bucks worth of groceries, got some great deals. Told my mom about the sales when she woke up at 5am, she went and checked the site and they are sold out. I don’t know if this is area specific, but I have never seen regular canned goods fly off the “shelf” that quick. Walmart’s site is showing most of the veggies double the price I bought them for less than 24 hrs ago. Pretty much if it comes in a can, or a box it’s been selling out in crazy rates here. I’ll post some screen shots below of some of the items that are sold out here, and what I paid yesterday.

Another similar and deadly coronavirus, MERS, is carried by camels.  Zoonotic diseases are common. The last major pandemic (spanish flu) was no bioweapon (hell we barely new anything about genetics or cellular biology back then) and also came from live animals. HIV also for that matter. The most likely explanation at the moment is zoonotic disease from a wet market. All novel zoonotic diseases go through a list of various potential animal carriers as scientists conduct research (SARS: Civets and then bats, MERS: bats and then camels and then maybe again bats, Ebola: monkeys and then bats...lots of bats).

I think there is some poetic justice to this being natural. Every year diatom plankton bloom in our oceans. Massive exponential growth. Then they all die...killed by viruses. Our bloom will come to an end one way or another. Nature tends to find a way to correct imbalances."

>The second wave of the 1918 pandemic was much deadlier than the first. The first wave had resembled typical flu epidemics; those most at risk were the sick and elderly, while younger, healthier people recovered easily. By August, when the second wave began in France, Sierra Leone, and the United States,[74] the virus had mutated to a much deadlier form. October 1918 was the deadliest month of the whole pandemic.[75]

>**This increased severity has been attributed to the circumstances of the First World War.[76] In civilian life, natural selection favors a mild strain. Those who get very ill stay home, and those mildly ill continue with their lives, preferentially spreading the mild strain. In the trenches, natural selection was reversed. Soldiers with a mild strain stayed where they were, while the severely ill were sent on crowded trains to crowded field hospitals, spreading the deadlier virus.** The second wave began, and the flu quickly spread around the world again. Consequently, during modern pandemics, health officials pay attention when the virus reaches places with social upheaval (looking for deadlier strains of the virus).[77]

Don’t drink or get drunk. The amount of times I’ve had an epic booze session only to come down with a cold after a hangover as my body immune system got hit is a lot.

Get good sleep. So no reddit at night :) a well rested body is best at fighting of a virus. 

Possibly increasing zinc intake might help with immune system.

Other natural remedies don’t have the same scientific basis but could help or give you a placebo that might help with your positive mental outlook. 

Personally I like to eat garlic when I have cold or the flu. Possibly there is some evidence allicin in raw garlic is an antiviral (although don’t know about its impact on this type of virus). 

Drink lots of water. You can include electrolytes with water to ensure your body regains salts you might be losing in a fever sweat.

You can freeze some nutritious meals now so if you are sick you can just heat them up easily.

 Finally I’d say ensure you are getting enough Vit D as well. Especially if you live in somewhere without much sun where it is the winter ATM

I read a story the other day where they quarantined the sole caregiver for a disabled boy, and the poor boy died (he was paralyzed). I would hope in most countries, even if a quarantine was necessary, they would offer the proper auxiliary services to family members who rely on them. What is happening in China right now is absolutely disgusting, and they should become the black sheep of the world for what they are doing."

2020-02-10,spaceddolphin,Coronavirus,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/f1u1xq/wuhan_doctor_conversation_leaked_hospital_turned/fh9e93i/,"If that interview holds any truth, then in Wuhan alone, nearly 30,000 people have died. 

24 hours in a day
60 minutes per hour
= 1140 min/ day
Each body takes 50 min 

1140/50 = 28.8 bodies per day per furnace 
* 11 furnaces = ~319 bodies per day per funeral home 

Assuming each funeral home services 8/23 hospitals in Wuhan and are just as busy, that means there are three funeral homes in Wuhan. At least one is more busy than the one the worker interviewed works at. 

So let’s say every day there are about 1035 bodies that the funeral homes are dealing with daily. 

If going back to 01/20 when it started getting bad (per the interview), about 22800 people have died (22 days). If we go back to account for the likely deaths before it got “bad”, and calculate at 27 days instead of 22. Then the number rises to 28,000.

Is my math right here?"

What you'll find, if you look a little, is a breakdown by ethnicity of the distribution of the ACE2 receptors.  Asians seem to have the most, while certain Middle Eastern people seem to have the least.  To the extent this makes a difference with regard to the ease of infection, it may be some answer as to why the virus seems to be spreading more rapidly in China."

There are not enough test kits, not enough doctors, and too many patients to truly have a accurate depiction of how many people are actually affected by this disease, and have died. 

There are numerous accounts from the people of China, and Wuhan especially, that claim people are dying at an unmanageable rate. These people who died are also not being tested for the 2019-nCov virus, they are just being cremated and the evidence destroyed. 

It’s a mass coverup by the CCP... also the WHO, HHS, CDC, etc are using these numbers because they are a government body who can ONLY REPORT THE STATISTICS THEY ARE GIVEN, and who do they receive these numbers from? The CCP.

We don’t know the death rate, the R0 is higher than reported, and the number of infected is vastly underreported do to lack of resources.

It’s bad, and to make matters worse, the US hasn’t reported any new cases, even though all other countries affected have. But there have been reports of massive “quarantine sites” being constructed in multiple states. This leads me to believe that the US government is trying to contain the virus, but also is preparing for the worst, because it is much worse than they are telling us.

And we won’t know until it’s too late."

A lot of what OP says is standard infection control procedure and not that hard to do.  I do what you do most of the time, except the mask. I do the mud room thing too. I've been called OCD because I have this outside/home thing going on and I don't care. Haven't had a cold or flu in 5 years. 

But once I'm home, I relax, I have livestock and dogs, I take no precautions whatsoever, I think sheep and cattle dung are especially protective (good bacteria). Never get infections either. I never even cover a cut with a plaster. Dogs lick the plates and pots, sit on the couch, shed hair and lick their bums, as does my cat. No worries. We're on roof water, it's not even filtered. I never even get an upset stomach.

Outside, humans: danger

Home, traditional livestock: safe"

The main reason there are so many deaths is, in my belief, that the Wuhan medical infrastructure is completely overwhelmed. Meaning many of the people needing intensive care are failing to obtain it. If there was only 100 people infected in Hubei province instead of the roughly 32 thousand they probably would all have an extremely high chance of survival. That isn't the case in Hubei but it is in other areas with infected individuals right now. Focus on the ""right now"", this is what is worrisome for other parts of the world that have large populations and poor medical care. I'm looking at Pakistan and India at the moment. So far so good but if this virus breaks free in a country like that it could be even deadlier than in Hubei. Developed countries should be able to handle this much better as long as they recognize the danger and stay on top of it, like they seem to be.

Edit: at the moment 974 deaths out of the 1013 are in Hubei province."
