* The president also said he’ll take “emergency action” to provide relief to workers who are affected. He said he’s asking Congress for $50bn for small business loans. He also called for “immediate” payroll tax cuts.

* He also downplayed warnings of a potential recession: “This is not a financial crisis, this is just a temporary moment of time that we will overcome as a nation and as a world,” he said.

* Trump temporarily suspends travel from Europe to the US The restrictions will not apply to the UK, he said. The travel restriction will start Friday, and last for 30 days amid virus outbreak.

* Trump also encouraged older Americans to avoid all travel if possible. He reviewed other measures his administration is taking to address the pandemic.

* Trump also encouraged older Americans to avoid travel if possible. Older people “must be very, very careful,” he said, calling on nursing homes to suspend “medically unnecessary visits.”


* “The vast majority of Americans, the risk is very, very low,” he said. But he said that older Americans should avoid travel, and endorsed social distancing and avoiding large gatherings. “Every community faces different risks,” he noted and encouraged Americans to listen to local officials.

* In his brief address, the president continued to signal that the pandemic is mainly a threat outside American borders, without fully acknowledging that the coronavirus is spreading within the US.


* Trump said that the US is doing better than Europe. “The EU failed to take the same precautions and restrict travel from China and other hot spots,” he said. “As a result, a large number of new clusters in the United States were seeded by travelers from Europe.”

* Trump said that the US is doing better than Europe, but whereas European nations have rolled out widespread testing, it’s still unclear how many cases we’ve had in America."

I think the best guidance to ask yourself is: if this were any other disease, would I go to the hospitals with the symptoms I am having? If I have what feels like a Flu, I may have muscle aches and feel crummy, but if I’m still able to eat and drink and get some rest, I should stay home.  If, instead, I get really short of breath and can’t keep any food down, I’d definitely head in.  The same is true with suspected COVID. We don’t have the tools to treat the virus, as clinical trials are still underway. But we do have the tools to treat your body and its symptoms when you’re ill and getting dehydrated. 

There is still no objective clear definition, but to me it's if you are having a hard time breathing or feel awful. We are happy to see you and assess you in real-time, but keep in mind that the danger of this virus is that it causes Acute Respiratory Distress syndrome. 

TL;DR: come to the hospital if you feel really bad."

* hemoptysis (coughing up blood) (0.9%)
* conjunctival congestion (0.8%) 

**Things we classified as very severe disease (about 13.8% have this)**

* dyspnea (shortness of breath while speaking)
* Breathing more than 30 breaths a minute
* blood oxygen saturation ≤93%, 
* Some lab data: PaO2/FiO2 ratio <300, and/or lung infiltrates >50% of the lung field within 24-48 hours)

**6.1% are critical** (respiratory failure, septic shock, and/or multiple organ dysfunction/failure)


**TLDR Mild really does mean mild, and runny nose/ runny eyes probably means you dont have COVID. If you're breathing fast or can't catch your breath while speaking, that is severe**"

Yesterday there is a case in Zhengzhou where someone traveled back from Italy, hide his travel history, and tested positive. 

As soon as the government know this, they sent out free msg to every citizens warning them about this new case and where he have been recently. 

Meanwhile, all his neighbors are going to do the virus test and forced to take 14 days quarantine. The companies these neighbors working in decide to take one day off immediately to wait for the test results. 

This person who intentionally hide the travel history is also waiting to be arrested(after he fully recover) for violating the laws. He's also a contractor for a small agency under the government and get fired directly. 

That's only a small part of all approaches we've done. The information is collected from social media and a story shared by his neighbor in a Chinese forum."

I'd bet many people have gotten coronavirus and were not aware they got it, which is both good and bad news. There are actually already reported cases in China where workers were tested positive for coronavirus and many of them *were* entirely unaware that they had it due to feeling close to no symptoms (I can search for the link if you want it).

Those would be the ""mild"" cases. Experiencing pneumonia and difficulty breathing is, according to the CDC, experienced with 'moderate' cases and is much less common than mild. Even less common is 'severe', which can include organ failure and requires immediate medical care. 

It's scary, and I mean no offense to the author, but making this seem like the general experience is exaggerated and will only spread more fear. Stay out of large public spaces or unneeded social gatherings and wash your hands, the odds of this happening to you are slim."

We sometimes see reinfection in patients who are ill or immunocompromised, but even that is rare.  With the flu, it actually has multiple strains so when there is “reinfection” it’s often a second infection with a different strain.  So, based on what we know so far, it should be very hard to be reinfected with COVID-19.  However, it’s important to emphasize that we really haven’t seen enough data to rule this out since not enough patients have fully recovered and then been re-exposed, and we’re all extrapolating at this point.

Job losses have begun in ports, bakeries and travel agencies. Economists worry more layoffs are coming as businesses see plummeting sales.

The coronavirus outbreak is taking a deep toll on the U.S. economy, prompting hundreds of layoffs over the past week alone and halting a historic 11-year bull market in stocks.
Strong job growth and soaring financial markets have fueled the U.S. economic expansion over the past decade. Now the rapid market decline and initial layoffs are heightening fears that the longest economic expansion in U.S. history could come to a sudden end, just a month after unemployment stood at a half-century low.

The Dow Jones industrial average lost 1,465 points, or 5.9 percent, Wednesday with every sector slumping after the World Health Organization designated the coronavirus a pandemic. The Dow closed in bear market territory, meaning it had shed more than 20 percent from its high less than a month ago.

Airlines, hotels, travel agencies and event companies have all been suffering, but interviews with more than two dozen firms and workers reveal that the pain is now translating into layoffs in a wider circle of industries, including a bakery and a chain restaurant.

At the Port of Los Angeles, 145 drivers have been laid off and others have been sent home without pay as massive ships from China stopped arriving and work dried up. At travel agencies in Atlanta and Los Angeles, several workers lost their jobs as bookings evaporated. Christie Lites, a stage-lighting company in Orlando, laid off more than 100 of its 500 workers nationwide this past week and likely will lay off 150 more, according to chief executive Huntly Christie. Meanwhile a hotel in Seattle is closing an entire department, a former employee said, and as many as 50 people lost their jobs after the South by Southwest festival in Austin got canceled.

Economists fear more layoffs in the coming weeks as supply chains come to a halt and people stay home and spend less.

We will definitely see an effect on jobs from the coronavirus, and it could be pretty large in leisure and hospitality,” said Julia Pollak, labor economist at ZipRecruiter. “The first thing we’ll see is a reduction in hours. We hear many reports of employers canceling staff everywhere except in health care.”

Monday in Los Angeles, Sam Creighton and about 20 colleagues were fired from the China Visa Service Center. Creighton helped Americans get travel documents to China, but business plummeted as groups and individuals canceled trips to Asia out of virus fear. The company processed around 400 visas a month; in February, that number fell to 22. The visa center did not return a request for comment.

“This job was my paycheck,” said Creighton, 27, who worked at the company for about three years. “I really don’t know what to do next.""

Baiden King lost her job at Carson’s Cookie Fix bakery in Omaha on Tuesday because online sales and customer traffic dried up dramatically — especially after the state’s first case of covid-19 was reported nearby. The company didn’t return a request for comment. King said her manager told her when she showed up for her shift that morning she had no choice. King made $11 an hour.

If my job’s laying off people, I can only imagine other employers are as well,” said King, who is preparing to move back in with her parents. “I’m not sure anyone will be hiring.”
These early coronavirus-related jobs cuts appear to have mostly affected younger, entry-level employees and gig workers. Workers receiving pink slips said they have no idea whether these layoffs will be permanent and that it is nearly impossible to look for another job right now, with many companies instituting hiring freezes. Uncertainty is high, and as people lose jobs — or fear losing jobs — they typically scale back spending even more, which has a ripple effect on local economies.

For example, the Port of Los Angeles, the busiest port in the United States, has become a “ghost town,” four workers said. They said the port has never been this quiet, not even during the Great Recession.

The ongoing lack of cargo prompted Shippers Transport Express to send layoff notices at the end of February to 145 drivers who transport containers from the port to corporate warehouse hubs. The company told workers there is a “near shutdown” of its operations at the port “for the foreseeable future.” Many factories closed in China, stunting shipments to the United States.

I’ve been working the ports for 13 years, and I’ve never seen anything like this,” said Randy L. Williams, a trucker for Shippers Transport Express. “I’m glad I didn’t buy a house yet.”

He said the port typically handles over 1,000 containers a night at his part of the operation, including some Walmart products, but is down to 200. He didn’t work at all last week and it’s been spotty this week.
Williams has dipped into his savings, and money is tight with a son in college. But he has union benefits and is applying for unemployment insurance. He also saved from years of $29-an-hour pay. Not everyone at the port has that situation.

Josue Alvarez drives for another company operating at the port, XPO Logistics, but is classified as an independent contractor, meaning he gets no vacation, sick days or health insurance. He pays for his truck and all related expenses. He typically makes $2,000 a week, but since mid-February has made $300 a week, an income he cannot survive on for long.

There’s a lot of uncertainty right now. My dispatchers say it will get worse before it gets better,” said Alvarez, who is 26 and lives with his parents. His father is also a trucker at the port. They show up early every day hoping for work but in the past two weeks almost always get sent home with no pay.
“The disruption to trade will be felt well beyond the dock workers,” said Stephen Levy, senior economist at the Center for Continuing Study of the California Economy. “Half of China’s goods come to the Port of Los Angeles. That will be felt by warehouse workers, truckers and people in the wholesale trade.”

The slowdown of goods moving across the country is hitting United Parcel Services hard, as drivers in Los Angeles have had their hours and pay scaled back. Ron Herrera, director of the Teamsters Port Division, the union representing UPS drivers, cited a decline in shipments because of coronavirus. A UPS spokesman said it was a “routine” staffing adjustment and that those drivers “are allowed to work at either a full- or a part-time” UPS facility.

Major airlines, weathering a massive decline in travelers, have not started layoffs, but nearly all have canceled routes and many have put on a hiring freeze, said Sara Nelson, international president of the Association of Flight Attendants-CWA, AFL-CIO, which represents about 50,000 flight attendants at 20 airlines.

“It’s just like a factory,” Nelson said. “When it slows down, and they cut all of the overtime hours, that is a massive pay cut for people right off the top.”

As consumers and businesses begin to pull back on spending, gig workers and independent contractors are having a particularly tough time. They are caught in limbo: Work is drying up, meaning they are effectively laid off, but they do not get to collect unemployment insurance. A payroll tax cut President Trump has proposed would not help them.

It’s kind of like I’m laid off but I’m not,” said Chad Denick, 35, who was told Monday he no longer needed to report to his job as a catering contractor for a tech company because employees would be working from home for the rest of the month. “But this is what I know: I don’t have a job at least until April.”
Denick stopped going out to restaurants and scaled back on purchases, like the $20 phone-charging mat he picked up a few days ago.

Spending behavior changes like that are one of the reasons, restaurant chains are starting to feel the crunch. Buca di Beppo, the Italian restaurant chain owned by Planet Hollywood, has begun laying off sales managers around the country, according to a former employee. Neither Buca di Beppo nor Planet Hollywood responded to a request for comment.

The cancellation of major conferences, including South by Southwest, Austin’s annual tech, music and film festival, also has created ripple effects of lost gigs. For Elle Mahoney, a freelance stage manager and producer, the South by Southwest cancellation knocked out 10 percent of her income. She just got engaged but is not planning or picking a wedding date.

“Everything is just on hold,” said Mahoney, 35, who is reaching out to people she used to nanny for to help make up lost pay. “It’s just really hard for us to depend on money from gig to gig.”

The economic strain is also starting to slow down and even freeze hiring that was in the works. In Kansas City, Mo., Sherry Caserta owns Travel Employment Agency, and she’s fielding a flood of phone calls, telling potential applicants their chances of landing a new job “are limited right now” as job postings are evaporating.
“The layoffs are already happening,” she said. “Most of these are last-hired, first-fired situations, but I’m really seeing it pick up this week in big cities: Atlanta, New York, Chicago.”"

The thought is that it is transmitted via large droplets, which a mask should help prevent.  HOWEVER, we have a shortage of masks worldwide, so rather than making a large purchase of masks if you are young and healthy, it’s best to try to leave them for older patients or those with significant medical illnesses. Thats why you may be hearing mixed messages. We really need them for people who are at high risk of death and contracting COVID.

The reports about masks not working are really based around the fact that - at this time - the evidence is that more restrictive N-95 masks are necessary to prevent the virus’ transmission (this may change - we’ll be watching the CDC’s webpage for those of us in the U.S.).  These require specific fitting, as there are different sizes.  The surgical masks you see most people wearing don’t actually limit much airflow and may - instead - offer a false sense of security.

Ironically the effective containment of SARS 1 was a reason for the major spread of COVID-19 in the first place. Instead of learning from that time, it created, together with fline- and birdflu, aswell as ebola, the illusion and complacency in europe and  the US that ""this is not goint to be a big deal and it is overhyped"". I think this thinking was a major factor for allowing the spread. Public was super duper slow to react, as well as (most) governments."

By David C. Unger  

March 11, 2020  
1:44 PM

Camogli, Italy — 

Under  other circumstances, being homebound here might not seem a bad thing.  Not for nothing is this stretch of the Italian Riviera  called the Golfo Paradiso, the Gulf of Paradise. From our apartment, my wife and I look  out at the Mediterranean, the nearby city of Genoa and the snow-capped  mountains beyond. Now, with no one supposed to leave home, there are no  errands to run, grace periods have been granted on mortgage, utility and  tax bills. My shelves bulge with books that I now have more time to  read.

But these circumstances are horrific. Italy is living  through a national tragedy of incomprehensible proportions. More than  10,000 people here are ill with the [coronavirus](https://www.latimes.com/california/liveblog/coronavirus-live-updates) and more than 800 have died. Things could get worse, much worse, before they get better.

And no one knows when this will end.

This region, known as Liguria, is not the worst hit, but is just  south of the areas that are. On Saturday, March 7, our streets and  beaches teemed with tourists from the colder cities of the north. On  Sunday morning, the government ordered the northern regions most  affected by the virus sealed off. Two days later [the whole country](https://www.latimes.com/world-nation/story/2020-03-10/coronavirus-has-turned-italy-into-a-beautiful-prison) was locked down.

On  Wednesday night, Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte announced the nationwide  closure of all shops, except food stores and pharmacies. Now our  streets and beaches are deserted, with most of the locals behind closed  doors.

It has come to this even though Italy moved early and  aggressively against the coronavirus threat with what it thought were  strict measures of containment. When two travelers, who arrived in Italy  from Wuhan, China, tested positive, they were quarantined and further  flights from China were banned. When a new cluster of cases emerged in  northern Italy in late February, the government moved quickly to  blockade all areas of known infection, sealing off some 50,000 people in  11 northern municipalities. But what seemed unusually strict soon  turned out to be not strict enough.

The virus had moved beyond a limited number of locations with a  limited number of people who had been in direct or indirect contact with  China or other foreign hot spots. It had turned into “community  spread,” infecting people who had not traveled anywhere but had picked  up the virus at the end of a longer chain of transmission.

Now the  Italian government asks everyone in Italy to stay home, keep a distance  of at least one meter from others,  to not shake hands or hug  when  greeting people. It also advises washing hands frequently because the  virus can stay alive outside the body and is present in droplets from  coughing or even exhaling. A main route of transmission is when people  touch surfaces that have virus-laden droplets and then touch their eyes,  noses or mouths.

To be extra cautious, I chat with my neighbors  mainly by Facebook Messenger to avoid face-to-face contact. Yet I am  able to do full and frequent advisory sessions with graduate students at  my university, hundreds of miles away, with Apple’s FaceTime. In the  age of the internet and social media, isolation is not what it once  would have been, at least for those with online connections.

There are huge economic and social consequences to shutting down a  whole country of 60 million people, telling everyone to stay home and  enforcing restrictions on even short-range travel.

But the most  profound crisis, and the one that is driving the government toward all  these restrictions, is the potential overwhelming of Italy’s hospital  system, particularly intensive care. If not soon checked, this epidemic  could lead to triage decisions that would potentially require rationing  emergency care to those with the best underlying health and with the  longest remaining life expectancy.

There is special concern about  the virus spreading to southern Italy, with its lower number of current  coronavirus cases but much thinner medical infrastructure. But local  officials report that areas of the north, like Lombardy, are already  close to being overwhelmed. And with Italian hospitals stretched to  capacity caring for coronavirus victims, other medical needs are going  unattended.

Italy is now a test case for the rest of Europe and  perhaps the U.S. as well. Learning the right lessons from Italy’s  current trials is now a matter of life and death."
