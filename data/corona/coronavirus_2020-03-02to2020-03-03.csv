Lipsitch: This is not an existential threat. This is, qualitatively, it's very much like a bad pandemic of influenza, which we experienced arguably twice or three times in the 20th Century. It's worse than the one that we experienced in 2009. But none of those brought civilization close to its knees. They made things awful for a while.

1/ Pence speaks: White house meets daily w/ head of VA and head of Medicare/Cedicaid

2/ 43 domestic cases, 48 returning cases. 29 out of 43 are from CA/WA state. Expert says there may be clusters.

3/ 4 fatalities today, 6 Americans fatalities total

4/ Risk of coronavirus to American people remains 'low' according to all people

5/ President says we are ready for everything. President's effort to bring the best minds and leadership at every level.

6/ Meeting with governors from 50 states and territories occured this morning. President sends gratitude to states who have repatriated. 'Seamless' relationship between state and federal government.

7/ Met today with pharmaceutical companies. Trump spoke about vaccine and therapeutics. Vaccine going into clinical trials within the next 6 weeks, but won't be available until late this year, early next year. Therapeutics might be available this summer or early fall. Pharmaceutical companies have worked together to form a consortium.

8/ Implementing travel advisories from SK and Italy. Implementing screening for 100% within 24 hours for all flights from South Korea and Itality.

9/ President has directed us to bring the best minds and leaders.

10/ Deborah Birx, ambassador at large, will be Pence's right hand (wo)man. Birx has served as scientist, physician combating HIV/AIDS with 3 decades of public health experience, interagency coordination.

11/ Birx speaks: she arrived from South Africa. She got computer and phone in 'record time', ie showing efficiency. Praising Trump about speed and efficiency of response.

12/ Azar speaks: Azar is fluffing Birx. Empty talk about productive relationships and efficiency.

13/ 43 'confirmed' or 'presumptive' cases. 17 out of 43 are travel related. 26 are from 'person to person' spread. Praises Pence's strong leadership. Immediate risk has been and continues to be low.

14/ Degree of risk has potential to change. Could become pandemic. Community spread may occur in the United States.

15/ May use 'mitigation efforts' learned from Singapore and Hong Kong, closing schools, online classes.

16/ Medicare/Medicaid services is important, blah blah old people. Seema Verma is speaking fluff about Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services roles.

17/ Working with CDC to update healthcare deadlines. Trying to figure out the types of services Medicare/Medicaid will pay for.

18/ Anthony Fauci from NIAID speaks: praising Trump and pharmaceutical CEOs. Praising Birx.

19/ Robert Redfield from CDC: Working with public health partners to identify new cases. Confirm cases, isolate, do contact tracing, limit spread of virus. Despite seeing new community cases, the risk to the American people is low.

My mom got it too, expect she has asthma so her cough is worse. But they both had a high fever for over a week...every day. Doctor said it was the flu but didn’t test them or anything. They were so sick after a week that they dragged themselves to the urgent care becuase the nurse on the phone said they needed to be tested for pneumonia, which the doctor didn’t end up doing because “everyone has these symptoms right now.” 

I have never seen them so sick in my life. We were joking about it being the coronavirus at first, but now they both are questioning if that’s what they had/have.  I was legitimately concerned for their well being, especially because I have seen my parents gets sick many, many times but never to this extent.  Is that really what the flu is like..?

He also ordered the state authorities to let a cruise with suspected infected people disembark (no other country wanted them). He said not accepting the cruise is “against human rights” and just opened Mexico to every single cruise with infected people.

Federal health officials botched an initial diagnostic test and restricted widespread screening. Critics fear the virus may gain a toehold in the U.S.


By Roni Caryn Rabin, Knvul Sheikh and Katie Thomas
March 2, 2020
Updated 6:31 p.m. ET

The coronavirus has found a crack in the nation’s public health armor, and it is not one that scientists foresaw: diagnostic testing.

As of Monday afternoon, there were at least 98 people infected with the new coronavirus in the United States — a sharp rise from the 65 known to be infected on Friday. Six deaths have been reported.

Several patients, in more than one state, had not traveled to China or other epidemic centers and may have caught the coronavirus in their communities, suggesting that it already may be circulating locally.

The case numbers are rising not just because the virus is spreading, but because testing has been expanded. And the persistent drumbeat of positive test results has raised critical questions about the government’s management of the outbreak.
How is it possible that the world’s most medically advanced nation has struggled to diagnose this infection? Why weren’t more Americans tested sooner? How many may be carrying the virus now?

Most disturbing of all: Did a failure to provide adequate testing give the coronavirus time to gain a toehold in the United States?

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s first attempt to produce a diagnostic test kit fell flat, after it had shipped hundreds out to the states. A promised replacement still does not permit state and local laboratories to make final diagnoses. The C.D.C. essentially ensured that Americans would be tested in very few numbers by imposing stringent and narrow testing criteria.

“Clearly, there have been problems with rolling out the test,” said Dr. Thomas Frieden, former director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which has struggled to make its diagnostic test widely available.

“There are a lot of frustrated doctors and patients and health departments.”

Dr. Frieden said he thought the situation was improving.
“The incompetence has really exceeded what anyone would expect with the C.D.C.,” said Dr. Michael Mina, an epidemiologist at Harvard University. “This is not a difficult problem to solve in the world of viruses.”

In February, the C.D.C. rolled out a three-step diagnostic test kit and distributed hundreds of kits to state and local health laboratories. But the third step in the diagnostic process was flawed, and produced some inconclusive results.

A full three-step replacement was promised but never arrived; the agency has not fully explained why, except to say that there was a manufacturing defect. As a result, diagnostic testing was only conducted at the agency’s labs in Atlanta, not state and local labs.


Getting results took days, and the C.D.C.’s criteria for testing were strict — among them, the patient must have recent travel to China or contact with someone known to be infected.

Doctors nationwide complained of a bottleneck, both because of the restrictive test criteria and because of the agency’s limited testing capacity. The agency said it had the capacity to test about 400 specimens a day.

The test criteria were “too stringent, and people aren’t getting tested,” said Lauren M. Sauer, an assistant professor of emergency medicine at Johns Hopkins Medicine.
“I’ve heard from so many colleagues that tests were turned down,” she added.

By the end of last week, as the first cases of possible community transmission began to emerge in California and Washington State, the C.D.C. broadened the number of patients who qualified for testing to include travelers returning from places like South Korea and Italy, and those with symptoms that could not be otherwise explained.

Late last week, the Food and Drug Administration broke the logjam, authorizing state and local laboratories to do initial testing on their own.

The move greatly expanded the nation’s testing capacity, as the C.D.C. also said it was shipping out new tests kits to the states as well. But final confirmatory tests must still be done at the C.D.C.

By that time, the C.D.C. had tested roughly 500 Americans with suspected infections identified by public health officials in the United States.


Other nations have tested patients by tens of thousands. China has tested millions.

“How come the South Koreans can do 10,000 tests a day and we can’t?” said Ralph Baric, who studies coronaviruses and emerging diseases at University of North Carolina.

“Once you knew you had asymptomatic spread and community spread in China, why is it that the United States of America hasn’t created tens of thousands of tests?”"

how seriously the #coronavirus is taken in #Hessen, I am currently experiencing first-hand: Yesterday I learned from the Portuguese press that a writer, with whom I worked in Póvoa de Varzim, has fallen ill with #COVID19. I immediately call 0800- 5554666 

on the official #Corona - Hotline they tell me it is Sunday and I should call my health office on Monday. More could not be done for me. The health department is responsible. 

But I'm worried, not about me, but mainly about the people I had contact with in the meantime. So I would like to know whether I have been infected. So I'm calling 116117 to tell them I'm on call. 

First of all, 116117 plays a minute-long soundtrack about Corona and that you should wash your hands. I've already washed my hands. I'd still like to take a test. For reasons. 

Meanwhile, the administration of the Portuguese town of Póvoa de Varzim is calling everyone, the publisher of the infected writer is releasing his staff. I'm waiting for a call back from the medical emergency service 

I get a call back with the promise of a ""great doctor."" When I have not received a call until 4:45 pm, I call again. My name was on the list... Meanwhile I receive anxious calls from all over the world 

Around 17:30 a person calls me and tells me to go to the family doctor on Monday. There is no official body in Hessen that would do #Corona tests. Meanwhile I should not leave the house. Whether my family may leave the house is my decision. 

It's Monday, 8:00 a.m., I'm being transferred to the health department. They tell me that my family doctor is in charge. But they do not have the necessary equipment. 

I call the public health department again. Now they promise to help me there, they call me back after half an hour and give me the number of a doctor I could turn to. 

They also send me an Excel list by a-mail, in which I should enter people I have had contact with. After all. 

I call the doctor whom the health department has given me and get a laugh: ""Are you a patient here? No, I'm not, but I had contact with a confirmed #Corona case and I want to get tested. ""We'll call you back."" 

Now I can understand why there are so few ""confirmed"" cases. In several places I could have given up trying to get in touch. I might have developed a slight fever and infected hundreds of others.

\#corona #coronavirus 

my #quarantine is voluntary so far, my son is skipping school, and my working day is wasted trying to find some place that is not only responsible but also takes the problem with #corona seriously. 

update, neither my family doctor nor the doctor I was told by the health department has the material for the #Corona test. Not available. In short: No test, no Corona case. 😆 

It is 13:08 Since 24 hours I know that I am the ""contact person"" of a ""confirmed Covid 19 sufferer"" and I try to get tested. All I have is an Excel list in which I am supposed to write down the names of the people I have met since 

A call to the University Hospital in Frankfurt shows that they allegedly do not test for #Coronavirus. I call 116117 again and they tell me that I should try the university hospital and that my family doctor should call the health department ..."

With chefs idle and vegetables rotting, China’s virus-hit restaurants say their goose is cooked

BEIJING — In the remote subtropical hills of southwest China, 80 miles from the Laos border and 1,200 miles from the heart of the coronavirus outbreak in Wuhan, Yao Tonghua is facing a serious cash crunch.

Yao borrowed heavily two months ago to put down $10,000 for a five-story building she hoped would become a palace of Sichuan cooking. Then came the epidemic. Her seven cooks now lounge around empty tables meant for 100 diners. Vegetables rot in the yard. Fish bob inside tanks, neglected.

“I thought the disease was confined to Wuhan and would have little impact on a small and far-flung city like ours,” said Yao, who is contemplating laying everyone off and selling the restaurant to stem mounting losses but is worried she wouldn’t find a buyer. “This is getting more and more hopeless by the day.”

Several weeks into an epidemic that brought the country to a standstill, Chinese officials and economists are increasingly worried about the devastation wrought on a crucial part of the economy: restaurants and retailers, karaoke halls and family-owned factories — countless small and midsize businesses that collectively employ 80 percent of China’s workers and produce 68 percent of the country’s business revenue.

“Only 30 percent of small and medium businesses nationwide have resumed work,” Shu Chaohui, an official at the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology, told reporters Tuesday. “It’s a pretty severe situation.”

In China’s ‘war’ on coronavirus, hospitals turn away other patients — with dire results

How severe is it? A nationwide survey led in February by Peking University found half the country’s small businesses will run out of cash within three months, and 14 percent might not survive past mid-March. Unlike large state conglomerates or multinational companies that could weather the storm, China’s small businesses say they simply do not have cash reserves to continue paying wages and rent.

And while manufacturing giants that mass-produce gadgets such as Apple iPhones can rely on the government to charter buses and trains to shuttle migrant workers back to their factories, nearly 40 percent of smaller businesses say they cannot get their workers back to Chinese cities because of transportation bottlenecks and quarantine restrictions, according to the Peking University study.

The Chinese government has been trying to prop up these small, vulnerable businesses — but with uncertain consequences. Ministries and bank regulators have been pressuring banks to extend loans to cash-strapped businesses. They have asked lenders to push back repayment deadlines or look the other way when payments are late. They have also waived requirements for businesses such as paying for social security.

Beyond that, experts say, policy options are limited when swaths of the country are effectively under lockdown and a cloud of anxiety. People simply do not want to go out and spend.

“If people don’t eat at restaurants, that doesn’t just affect the restaurant but also the seafood supplier or farmer. If people don’t shop for clothes, that affects the silkmaker and weaver,” said Dai Ruochen, a Peking University economist who helps lead the survey group. “The economic impact isn’t contained; it sends ripples up level by level.”

Then there is the effect on employment. In recent weeks, companies across the country have posted online notices apologizing to customers for closing and to employees for mass layoffs.

A debt cloud darkens

In the once buzzing metropolis of Shenzhen, Cao Tianfei closed a roast-fish restaurant and paid a $36,000 penalty to break his rental contract in a mall that was shut down for two weeks in February. He laid off 15 workers.

“I felt like I abandoned my kids,” he said. “But I had no choice. Every morning I wake up, rent and salaries just get sucked out of me.”

Cao said the unpredictable nature of the epidemic had scrambled his planning. “I’ve never considered borrowing money from the bank, because I can’t see the end of the virus,” he said. “Even if it ended today, it would still be a long way for us to get out of this.”

To counter the uncertainty, China’s leaders have tried to project calm. National authorities have set a late-April target for the virus to be fully contained, and a central-bank official took to international media to tout how China has rolled out no less than 30 policy measures, many of which specifically target “small and micro” businesses, to ensure a quick rebound.

“The most likely scenario is a V-shaped curve, which means a decline in economic activities followed by a rapid recovery, with the total economic impact relatively contained,” People’s Bank of China deputy governor Chen Yulu predicted in a Financial Times op-ed.

But there are risks to China’s desperate attempt to restart its economy, and many businesses will inevitably die off, economists predict.

Chinese authorities’ hands are tied when it comes to asking banks to forgive late payments or issue even more risky loans to bail out faltering businesses, said Andrew Collier, a managing director at Orient Capital Research who frequently speaks to Chinese bank executives.

The coronavirus hit at a time when many Chinese banks were already wobbling with bad loans and households and businesses were burdened by massive levels of debt.

China’s economy, having weathered the trade war, is now jolted by coronavirus

China’s leaders “are trying to straddle between having an economic meltdown and crashing the banks,” Collier said. He added, “They will rather let some businesses go belly up than watch banks collapse.”

Survival mode

Across the country, a few small businesses are hoping to survive by creative means rather than government bailout.

Owspace, a chain of bookstores and cultural spaces that is popular with China’s urban literary and art crowd, is asking book lovers to make online donations of between $7 and $1,100 as revenue plunges 80 percent. Expatriates in Beijing recently launched a GoFundMe crowdfunding campaign to raise $330,000 to save Comptoirs de France, a long-established bakery chain with 16 locations.

Holed up in an apartment in Wuhan, Zuo Weiwei, an entrepreneur who has been selling cosmetics and nutritional supplements online, said the congestion and breakdown in China’s shipping industry forced her to end her business.

“Dozens of customers who had preordered products from me asked for refunds,” she said. “I simply couldn’t take it anymore.”

Hundreds of boxes of beauty masks, dietary supplements and silver-coated Buddhist amulets lay piling up in her house. Under these circumstances, Zuo said, she is drastically downsizing her ambitions.

“I’ve given up hopes of selling stuff and making a fortune,” she said. “My wish for this year is for me and my family to stay healthy and not get infected.”

Translation of NHK story:

""The Japanese Association for Infectious Diseases (JAID) have published a report on their website detailing the symptomatic improvement and recovery seen following administration of inhaler-type medication used in the treatment of asthma to patients suffering from pneumonia as a result of the novel coronavirus.

The report is being published to the JAID website by a group which includes Kanagawa prefectural Ashigarakami hospital, one of the facilities that has carried out treatment on passengers of the cruiseliner Diamond Princess, which saw a mass outbreak of the novel coronavirus.

According to the report three patients suffering pneumonia and confirmed by PCR testing to be infected with the novel coronavirus were administered, upon their consent, an immunosuppressive inhaled steroid *Ciclesonide* typically used in the treatment of asthma.

Of the three all were over the ages of 65, and though not in critical condition all were receiving supplemental oxygen. However, after Ciclesonide treatment was administered on February 20th, noticeable improvements were seen within two days and a 73-year-old female patient has since been discharged in good health.

The clinical group has stated choosing the treatment protocol based on information received from the National Institute of Infectious Diseases, with the hope that by aerosol delivery it will prove effective in suppressing the severe inflammation in the lung tissue where the virus prevalently grows. 

The group says that their findings can't yet be fully evaluated with the small number of patients, and plans to partner with other healthcare facilities going forward to investigate the results further."""

Hold on to your butts, this drink centers around regret in a bottle: Tequila. If they were to sell a wine based on Peter's season, ""Bottled Regret"" sounds like a pretty appropriate name. This week we've got the **Spill Your Guts** in honor of this week's \#speakyourtruth session (working title was ""Spill the Tea-quila""). Honestly, I really only care to hear about how bad Peter's frankenstein face looks in person. 

  
* 1 oz Tequila  
* 1 oz Smoky Mezcal  
* 1 oz Lime Juice  
* 1 oz Blackberry Liqueur  
  

Start with the salt rim, regular salt works just fine but smoked salt is even better. Put on a swimsuit and serve it over crushed ice if you've already canceled your trip to cabo because of coronavirus. Unfortunately I'm not as good at crushing ice as I am at crushing dreams, so I just shook it with ice and nursed it like a little bitch. Strain into a fancy glass and garnish with a lime wheel. Down that bad boi and tell your totally platonic friend how many times you've pictured them naked."
2020-03-02,TRFilune,Anxiety,11,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/eupik4/coronavirus_megathread/fjb5amq/,"Hey there.

I've been checking this thread every single day since the beginning of the spread of the virus outside of Wuhan, China. I want to provide the impression we got from Spain, which is one of the countries affected by COVID-19, ever since the big cluster in Italy has been identified.

Unfortunately, yes, we could not hold the spread of the virus to the mainland. But it was meant to happen, a virus this infectious can't be held off forever. However, life is still going on, even in Torrejon de Ardoz, where a cluster was identified (the town I live in). Here in Spain, people have already emptied the pharmacies from all of the masks. It makes me cringe and facepalm hard, because we know that the masks that the pharmacies offer are only useful to prevent the infected from spreading the disease. 

Truth be told, I was still anxious about this, but at one point, I have realized that it is useless to worry needlessly. This thing is beyond our control, but all we can do is to take control of the things we can do. Keep washing your hands properly, avoid large crowds if possible. If you have to use public transportation, find a secluded spot, or wait till a more empty transport shows up. I've been doing this for a while, and believe me, I have to take public transportation all the damn time to get to my college in Madrid.

The thing that has helped me cope with this is regular contact with several friends that have worked in the medical field. And they have been a very good help. So was this thread. 

I am not sure if that german virologist was speaking the truth, when he mentioned that the real case fatality ratio would fall off to 0.5%, but I would rather trust his word, than the word of the local media here, who has done nothing but compare the Coronavirus to the Spanish Flu of 1918. 

If you guys want, I can keep providing regular updates with the situation at my hometown. Currently, the Ministry of Health is thinking whether we should close schools for a time in Torrejon de Ardoz, but we'll see what comes out of it. Tomorrow I will go to the doctor to check on my raspy throat, been having it for 2 weeks. But since I got a runny nose and sneezes, doubt it can be Corona-Chan for this case, ey?"

Dear Family and Friends, as some of you may recall, when I was a professor of pathology at the University of California San Diego, I was one of the first molecular virologists in the world to work on coronaviruses (the 1970s). I was the first to demonstrate the number of genes the virus contained. Since then, I have kept up with the coronavirus field and its multiple clinical transfers into the human population (e.g., SARS, MERS), from different animal sources. The current projections for its expansion in the US are only probable, due to continued insufficient worldwide data, but it is most likely to be widespread by mid to late March and April. Here is what I have done and the precautions that I take and will take. These are the same precautions I currently use during our influenza seasons, except for the mask and gloves.: 
1) NO HANDSHAKING! Use a fist bump, slight bow, elbow bump, etc.
 2) Use ONLY your knuckle to touch light switches. elevator buttons, etc.. Lift the gasoline dispenser with a paper towel or use a disposable glove. 
3) Open doors with your closed fist or hip - do not grasp the handle with your hand, unless there is no other way to open the door. Especially important on bathroom and post office/commercial doors. 
4) Use disinfectant wipes at the stores when they are available, including wiping the handle and child seat in grocery carts. 
5) Wash your hands with soap for 10-20 seconds and/or use a greater than 60% alcohol-based hand sanitizer whenever you return home from ANY activity that involves locations where other people have been. 
6) Keep a bottle of sanitizer available at each of your home's entrances. AND in your car for use after getting gas or touching other contaminated objects when you can't immediately wash your hands. 
7) If possible, cough or sneeze into a disposable tissue and discard. Use your elbow only if you have to. The clothing on your elbow will contain infectious virus that can be passed on for up to a week or more! 
What I have stocked in preparation for the pandemic spread to the US: 1) Latex or nitrile latex disposable gloves for use when going shopping, using the gasoline pump, and all other outside activity when you come in contact with contaminated areas. 
Note: This virus is spread in large droplets by coughing and sneezing. This means that the air will not infect you! BUT all the surfaces where these droplets land are infectious for about a week on average - everything that is associated with infected people will be contaminated and potentially infectious. The virus is on surfaces and you will not be infected unless your unprotected face is directly coughed or sneezed upon. This virus only has cell receptors for lung cells (it only infects your lungs). 
The only way for the virus to infect you is through your nose or mouth via your hands or an infected cough or sneeze onto or into your nose or mouth. 
2) Stock up now with disposable surgical masks and use them to prevent you from touching your nose and/or mouth (We touch our nose/mouth 90X/day without knowing it!). This is the only way this virus can infect you - it is lung-specific. The mask will not prevent the virus in a direct sneeze from getting into your nose or mouth - it is only to keep you from touching your nose or mouth. 3) Stock up now with hand sanitizers and latex/nitrile gloves (get the appropriate sizes for your family). The hand sanitizers must be alcohol-based and greater than 60% alcohol to be effective. 4) Stock up now with zinc lozenges. These lozenges have been proven to be effective in blocking coronavirus (and most other viruses) from multiplying in your throat and nasopharynx. Use as directed several times each day when you begin to feel ANY ""cold-like"" symptoms beginning. It is best to lie down and let the lozenge dissolve in the back of your throat and nasopharynx. Cold-Eeze lozenges is one brand available, but there are other brands available. I, as many others do, hope that this pandemic will be reasonably contained, BUT I personally do not think it will be. Humans have never seen this snake-associated virus before and have no internal defense against it. Tremendous worldwide efforts are being made to understand the molecular and clinical virology of this virus. Unbelievable molecular knowledge about the genomics, structure, and virulence of this virus has already been achieved. BUT, there will be NO drugs or vaccines available this year to protect us or limit the infection within us. Only symptomatic support is available. I hope these personal thoughts will be helpful during this potentially catastrophic pandemic. Good luck to all of us, James Robb, MD FCAP"

That is .000003% of people. You have a higher chance of winning the lottery than meeting someone with it right now. Even then you might not get infected. Similar rates occur in almost every country across the world. Unless they’re coming in from China or another country with a lot of cases, it’s completely ridiculous to take this sort of action right now.

Even China which has the most cases by far only has .0008% of their population infected. 

The mass hysteria created by the virus is a much much bigger issue than the virus itself is right now. 

Eventually the virus may be something to worry about. Right now it’s not if you’re just a person in the US, or in almost any country.

Taking “every health caution” is not reasonable at all unless the disease has an very high infection rate, very high mortality rate or your country has a lot of cases. None of those things are true in the US. 

Do not ask people to do anything because they’ve travelled on a plane unless it’s from China or another highly infected country. Completely ridiculous. If you’re that worried, then You need to stay home and not bother other people with this outlandish paranoia. 

New viruses like this spring up every few years and everyone loses their shit. Only now people are realllly reallllllly losing their shit. Remember swine flu?... no one even gives a shit about it now.

I’m not saying coronavirus isn’t a threat, but it’s not something that the everyday US citizen needs to take action on at this point. The chances of you dying on the way to your gym today are much higher than your chance of seeing someone with the virus any time soon. Are you going to stop driving to take “every health caution”?...

If the infection rate gets a lot higher then we can start taking steps. Right now relax and stop reading news articles about it. They get paid to scare you."

Practical steps to get ready, without hitting the panic button.

Harvard epidemiology professor Marc Lipsitch told The Atlantic last week. “I think the likely outcome is that it will ultimately not be containable.” Yikes. But he also said this: even though he predicts some 40 to 70 percent of people around the world will be infected with the virus that causes COVID-19, “it’s likely that many will have mild disease, or may be asymptomatic.”

The California Department of Public Health agrees. In a statement yesterday it said, “While COVID-19 has a high transmission rate, it has a low mortality rate. The international data we have, of those who have tested positive for COVID-19, approximately 80% do not exhibit symptoms that would require hospitalization.”

In other words, there’s no need to panic.

Another class is in a room outfitted with all the latest tech for panoptos (CSE2 Amazon G20) and the teacher all quarter hasn't used panopto because they dislike wearing a mic. Concerns have been brought up in online discussion boards and they said that they would look into adding panopto for this reason but said there was nothing they could do for this week's classes that haven't happened yet. This is of concern for me cause I (like the psych 334 prof) have all the symptoms of a healthy person contracting coronavirus and can't afford to miss class in week 9 that I can't watch online. And I highly doubt I'm the only person in this boat as everyone in my house has the same symptoms and none of them skipped school today for the same reason. And I haven't talked to anyone today that wasn't sick in class today. 

It largely seems like UW is ignoring the issue. In the daily article released today:
""There are no coronavirus cases on the UW campus, with four students testing negative for the virus earlier this quarter, and the university and health officials saying the risk to the community is low.""
this seems to be ignoring the reality of the matter. While no one has a confirmed case, between the medical expenses of the test and other factors I'm not going to the hospital unless it gets serious. And I think many other UW students are in this boat. So I and many others might have it and just have no idea. 

And the assumption that COVID-19 hasn't made it to UW in the 6 weeks that people were walking around with unknown COVID-19 is a bad one. As I see it, UW is a massive hub for the entire state of Washington. If it's in Washington then there is little doubt in my mind that it is on campus and I think UW officials should stop making their poor assumptions.

Overall I'm not worried for myself because I'm a healthy young adult but there are a lot of populations that don't have that privilege and UW is just fostering bad practices right now amongst their students. However, I am worried that (if I don't have COVID-19) walking around as sick as I am right now is putting me into one of those high-risk groups."

It wouldn’t address the underlying problems of disruption to the supply chain and the potential economic impacts of quarantine and other virus containment measures, and, given the starting point, can only really have an impact at the margins. I mean, if businesses aren’t borrowing at a ten-year rate of around 1%, why would they at 0.75%, or even 0.5%?

As someone who in general believes that the market’s dependence on the Fed is almost as dangerous as it is pathetic, I want to agree with both arguments, but neither of them is valid.

The flu varies from season to season, but it's much less than that. [This article says the flu is at 0.095%](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/02/03/the-flu-has-already-killed-10000-across-us-as-world-frets-over-coronavirus.html).

To put that in perspective, if 30 million people got the flu, and a different 30 million people got COVID-19, then we would see this amount of deaths using the above fatality rates:

Flu - 28,500 deaths

COVID-19 - 690,000 deaths

Moreover:

> A total of 81% of cases in the JAMA study were classified as mild, meaning they did not result in pneumonia or resulted in only mild pneumonia. Fourteen percent of cases were severe (marked by difficulty breathing), and 5% were critical (respiratory failure, septic shock, and/or multiple organ dysfunction or failure).

So, up to 19% may require hospitalization. 

Given how serious that is, you and your boyfriend should follow the CDC advice of [staying the fuck away from people](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/about/transmission.html). Being within 6 feet of an infected person is enough for them to transmit virus to you. So, stand at least that far back and avoid crowded locations as this disease spreads."

This was an unfortunate weekend for Ontario as we have confirmed another 11 positive cases, pushing us into the double digits. We have a lot to talk about today so lets start with the cases that popped up. 

The first we'll talk about is actually a case that happened on Friday, but it was at [9:56pm] (https://news.ontario.ca/mohltc/en/2020/02/ontario-confirms-new-positive-case-of-covid-19-1.html) and was not clear on the daily update at 10:30am. The unfortunate 8th case is a man in his 80s, that presented himself to Scarborough Health Network's General Hospital. The noticeable thing is that this man didn't not have a travel history to China or Iran like the previous cases, but rather had a travel history to Egypt instead. The fortuante thing is that his condition seems well and he was discharged from the hospital and is now in self-isolation. 

Now let's move to Saturday, we had an increase of [3 cases] (https://news.ontario.ca/mohltc/en/2020/02/ontario-confirms-new-positive-cases-of-covid-19.html). The 9th case is a 34 year old woman with a travel history to Iran and presented herself to Mackenzie Health Hospital. Whilst the 9th case did have some symptoms of the virus such as dry cough, runny nose, shortness of breath and headache, her condition was deemed to be light and she was sent to self-isolation. 

The 10th and 11th case are a couple who have presented themselves at Lakeridge Health Ajax Pickering. The 10th case is a 51 year old woman who had a travel history to Iran and she also had some symptoms of a cough, body aches and chills. It seems her condition also seems light as she was discharged from the hospital and is now in self-isolation

The 11th case is a 69 year old man and is the husband of the 10th case. However, the 11th case did not have a recent travel history to Iran. He only has a cough and was discharged from the hospital to be placed in self-isolation. Due to the fact that he did not have a travel history to Iran, it is likely that the 10th case infected the 11th case, making this the first H2H transmission in Ontario (officially).

Now let's move to Sunday where we have [our 4 new cases] (https://news.ontario.ca/mohltc/en/2020/03/ontario-confirms-new-positive-cases-of-covid-19-1.html). The 12th case is a man in his 50s and is the brother to one of the previous cases who had a travel history to Iran (the article didn't specify which case). He was assessed, tested and discharged from Mackenzie Richmond Hill Hospital and is now in self-isolation. 

The 13th case is a man in his 40s who is the husband to the 9th case (The article actually just says ""*the spouse of York Region's first Iran travel-related case announced yesterday.*"" Like seriously? Is it so hard to just say the 9th case? Why make is so hard to figure this out, I feel like I'm playing detective here, lol.). He was travelling with his wife from Iran so its unsure if he and his wife were both infected in Iran or if the wife infected the husband (doesn't really matter in the end). He was asymptomatic and was in self-isolation before prior to developing symptoms so perhaps he realized the possibility after his wife developed symptoms. 

The 14th case is a man in his 60s who returned from Iran. He was presented to North York General Hospital and was discharged the same day to be put in self-isolation. 

The 15th case is a woman in her 70s who was a 'contact' of the 8th case. She was tested at Southlake Regional Health Centre and is now in self-isolation. 

To safeguard the public against the increasing COVID-19 cases, Ontario has implemented [enhanced measures] (https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/fcm8d5/ontario_canada_implementing_enhanced_measures_to/fjbln0w/). 

The small silver lining from the large rise of cases is that rise in the tested cases for Ontario. We have now reached over 1000 people tested and hopefully this growth continues to increase.

I'm immunosuppressed, and I work on the same floor as our international departments who travel to China and Italy on the regular; as well as the fact that I have a kid in 4th grade that catches everything and brings it home...and an elderly father that I take care of.

And let say that you are a very healthy male with strong immune system.  And on top of that, you have taken your flu vaccine shot.  All of the above make you a super human to fight against most of the common flu, because over time our body have build up enough immunity to fight off against most of the common flu.  However, the coronavirus is a totally new virus that just suddenly shows up and no one on earth has any immunity against it.  That means anyone can catch this virus and pass it to anyone else.

So while most uneducated people love to shout ""I'm almost certain that this virus is far, far less deadly than people think.""  And they are partially right, because even if you were to catch this virus, you will be 99% fine.  But if your poor grandmother is unlucky enough to catch the virus from you.  Then she is most likely to die as a result.  If you don't believe me, then just read up on what happen at ""Life Care Center of Kirkland Washington.""

edit: I didn't even mention that about 20% of the people will need to be hospitalized because of this virus.  And if the hospital is full, that takes space away from other people who are sick with something else that required care.  And if they don't get the care they need, then they might die also.

Anywhere from 12,000-61,000 people die of the regular flu in the US every year. Coronavirus appears to be more deadly. while the regular flu only has a mortality rate of about 0.1%, covid19 appears to be anywhere between 0.5%-2%. 

So much is very uncertain. If the mortality rate ends up being on the low side and governments take quick drastic action to prevent the spread, it could be less deadly than the regular flu. 

If the mortality rate ends up on the high side and not enough action is taken quickly to stop the spread, then we could easily end up surpassing those numbers.

When people say it’s just a “bad flu” they are dramatically underselling how bad the flu is. Flu deaths in the US in some years have surpassed deaths from motor vehicle accidents. But the regular flu is predictable, it is containable, and we know the rules it plays by. Coronavirus is what is described as “novel”, which means we don’t have standard treatments for it, and we are basically just guessing. 

No matter what, the economic impact of this will be huge. Schools, businesses and transportation will be shut down in many places, and it already is shut down in some.

Fear of contracting the COVID-19 coronavirus is impacting Sydney brothels with predominantly Asian establishments reporting loss of business while Australian sex workers experience a rise in demand.

**Exclusive:** The coronavirus has hit the sex industry with some brothels reporting an eye-watering 80 per cent fall in clients.

Fears of contracting the COVID-19 disease has put punters off visiting Sydney’s predominantly Asian establishments, forcing owners desperate to drum up business to bar Chinese sex workers returning from virus-hit Wuhan for two weeks, the time it can take to develop symptoms.

Some brothels say their Australian sex workers have experienced a rise in demand, leaving the majority of Asian girls twiddling their thumbs.

Business has been so slack at Pyrmont 200, where ten ladies in their 20s predominantly from Bali, Japan and China work the roster, the manager is toying with closing the club’s narrow door in Harris Street.

“If this was my only business, I’d shut it down, we used to have around 23 clients a day, now we have about 15, it’s been like this for six weeks and each week gets worse,” said manager Bing Wang.

“Regulars are panicking and calling asking ‘does anyone have the coronavirus?’ because we do people-to-people touching.

“I’m checking the girls’ Uber apps and bank statements to make sure they’ve been travelling and shopping in Australia for the past 14 days. They’re not allowed back here if they’ve been to China, unless they’ve been in Australia 14 days.

“We’ve lost around 35 per cent of business and I want to assure our regulars it’s safe here. Everyone’s worried, the girls are worried about clients and the clients are worried about the girls.

“On the flip side our Aussie girls are doing great, they’re getting 80 per cent of the business because customers are turning to them.”

Penny’s 77 gentleman’s club in Newtown is still switching on the neon sign beckoning customers up a narrow staircase but business has dropped a staggering 84 per cent in recent weeks, from an average 26 customers a day to four.

“Business is very quiet, we are still getting customers but people are scared,” said the owner of two years who asked not to be named.

“Sunday, we only had four, or five clients, it’s always quiet on Sundays and Mondays but it’s never been like this – customers are ringing up asking ‘are any of your girls sick?’

“I say ‘no, we don't have any sick girls in my shop’. If any of the girls are sick I tell them not to come in.”

Bellevue 12 bordello in Surry Hills, with just a dozen Taiwanese, Chinese and Thai women on its books, says Sunday trade has plummeted from 20 punters a day to an average seven.

“It’s very, very quiet but people are still coming,” said owner Ton Li.

“Customers are worried and don’t want to part with their money – we don't have the virus here.”

Sex worker Claudia at Tiffany’s, perhaps Sydney’s best-known bordello offering standard full service, said: “Touch wood, it’s business as usual here, we haven't been affected.”

Amanda at Kelly’s Asian Flowers in Five Dock says customers are still trickling in.

“It’s very quiet, the virus has made customers nervous,” she said."

That they would not at a minimum take immediate action to contact their fellow passengers is a shameful reflection ignorance or incompetentness.

Authorities are trying to track the movements of a Chinese university student who has been confirmed with [coronavirus](https://www.theaustralian.com.au/topics/coronavirus) after “self-quarantining” in Dubai, under a [mechanism being used to bring Chinese students into Australia](https://www.theaustralian.com.au/nation/coronavirus-1500-chinese-students-able-to-beat-travel-ban/news-story/2b9eea2f956159c849a624be2d7c1e3f).

The 20-year-old University of Queensland student had been in Dubai for at least 14 days – without supervision – before he entered Australia via Brisbane on February 23.

He started showing symptoms two days later.

The man is currently in a stable condition in isolation in the Royal Brisbane and Women’s Hospital.

Sources told The Australian that authorities did not believe he had attended lectures at UQ because “he was so unwell”.

“His flatmate is now in isolation but is not showing any signs of the virus,’’ the source said.

The sick student lives in Toowong, nearby to the UQ campus.

Queensland health minister Steven Miles is expected to do a press conference about the case in the next hour.

Dr Jeannette Young, Queensland Chief Health Officer said authorities were working to determine where the man may have contracted the virus and to determine who he came into contact with.

“The male has recently returned to Brisbane and we are working closely with relevant authorities to undertake contact tracing.” Dr Young said.

“The male lived with one other housemate in Toowong. We are in contact with the male’s housemate, who is undergoing assessment.

“Our contact tracing methods are tried and trusted and we will take every opportunity to raise awareness of this case in the community if there has been any community exposure.”

The man is the tenth person to be confirmed with the COVID-19 virus in Queensland, including the three people from the Diamond Princess Cruise Ship."

Jobs will be lost, some theaters may close and it will take weeks or months before people feel comfortable out in public again."

>Today, Christine Elliott, Deputy Premier and Minister of Health, announced Ontario is implementing an enhanced response structure that formally brings together a wide range of partners to review, strengthen and implement provincial and regional plans and ensure their responsiveness to the specifics of COVID-19.

>""Our local public health units, hospitals, emergency health services, nurses and primary care providers, among others, have been critical in managing the early phases of this new coronavirus,"" said Elliott. ""This new structure will tap into an even broader network of clinical expertise, experience and capacity across the health sector to ensure extensive plans are in place to quickly and effectively respond to any and every possible scenario.""

>The new response structure will comprise a number of tables with specific mandates:

>A new Command Table will be the single point of oversight providing executive leadership and strategic direction to guide Ontario's response to COVID-19. The Command Table reports to the Minister of Health. The table will be chaired by the Deputy Minister of Health, Helen Angus, and include Dr. David Williams, Ontario's Chief Medical Officer of Heath; Matthew Anderson, Ontario Health's President and Chief Executive Officer; with representation from Public Health Ontario, the Ministry of Long-Term Care and Ministry of Labour, Training and Skills Development.

>Five regional planning and implementation tables, led by Ontario Health with support from local public health units, will be responsible for reviewing regional plans to proactively ensure local readiness and implementing provincial strategies in areas such as assessment, testing and care, supplies and equipment, surveillance and communications.

>The Ministry's Emergency Operations Centre, also known as MEOC, will continue to provide situational awareness and perform an overall coordination function among the components of the response structure.

>A Scientific Table, led by Public Health Ontario, will support the provincial and regional components of the response structure with the provision of evidence, and scientific and technical advice to inform planning and response.

>An Ethics Table, led by the University of Toronto Joint Centre for Bioethics, will assist in providing ethical guidance and representation at both provincial and regional tables to support decision-making throughout the response.
Sector or Issues Specific Tables, which would have a specific focus like supporting the coordination of repatriated Canadians or local case and contact management as well as sector-specific coordination such as paramedic services, First Nations health partners and others as needed.

>A Collaboration Table with members from key health sector organizations which will provide advice to the Command Table.

>This new response structure will build on the definitive steps that Ontario has already taken to address COVID-19, including:

>Designating novel coronavirus as a disease reportable under Ontario's public health legislation to strengthen the province's ability to detect, monitor and contain potential cases;

>Creating a dedicated web page, with links and resources, to help Ontarians learn how to protect themselves, what to do if they are sick after they travel and how to recognize possible symptoms;

>Developing guidance for the health system to guide actions during the initial stages of the containment phase; and,

>Deploying Ontario's Emergency Medical Assistance Team to support repatriation efforts at CFB Trenton and the NAV Centre.

>""Although the risk to Ontarians remains low, it is important that we take decisive steps to prepare for any scenario as this is a quickly evolving situation globally,"" said Elliott. ""As we enter this next phase of preparedness, every Ontarian should have full confidence that these efforts by our dedicated public health professionals and health care leaders will continue to keep them safe."""

Washington state announced four more coronavirus deaths on Monday, bringing the total death toll in the the United States to six, officials said, as the virus continues to spread despite travel restrictions aimed at curtailing it.

As the global death toll passed 3,000, South Korea on Monday confirmed 599 new cases, far higher than the daily tally reported in China. With 4,335 confirmed infections and at least 22 deaths, South Korea has the second-largest national caseload. However, it has tested more than 100,000 people, far more than most nations.

In the United States, tests have taken place at a far slower pace. A genetic analysis suggested that the coronavirus, which causes a highly infectious respiratory disease called covid-19, has been spreading undetected for about six weeks in Washington state. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration on Saturday took steps to sharply expand testing.
Italy has more than 1,600 confirmed cases, while Iran surpassed 1,500, with 66 deaths. Travelers from both countries appear to have spread the virus to other nations in the Middle East and Europe. A French citizen was diagnosed with the virus in Senegal on Monday, marking the country’s first known case and only the second in sub-Saharan Africa. Elsewhere, Indonesia, one of the few large nations thought to be free of the virus, said Monday it had two confirmed cases, while others were reported from Australia to India to Portugal.

Here are the latest developments:

•	In China, 202 new cases brings the total to there 80,026, including 2,912 deaths.

•	There are at least 18 confirmed cases of coronavirus in Washington state. Kirkland, Wash., has become a hub for the coronavirus response, as evidence suggests the virus may have spread undetected in the state for weeks.

•	Texas Gov. Greg Abbott called on the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to cancel the planned release of dozens of people from quarantine in his state after a patient tested positive for the virus after she was mistakenly released and spent 12 hours in the community, visiting a mall and a hotel.

•	After heavy losses on global markets last week, stocks recovered slightly Monday as comments by the Bank of Japan chief stoked speculation of a coordinated global response from central banks. The turnaround comes amid fears that prolonged economic disruption due to the virus could trigger a worldwide recession."

It is important that we are doing all we can as contributing members of society to help mitigate strain on healthcare systems and supply chains so they function as well as possible to help those who need it. Getting the flu shot could prevent you from needing medical attention that will be strained with an influx of covid-19 patients. Buying small quantities of food here and there for 3 days supply, (not a week or a month) will be absorbed into our supply chain without causing shortages. It will also prevent you from needing to go to the store filled with people during panic buying. 

I don’t blame people reacting on their anxiety, it is hard not to, but if we all succumb to it can be paralyzing and unhelpful to ourselves and society. You don’t need bottled water. Our water treatment will not be affected. You don’t need 50 rolls of toilet paper. 



TLDR; don’t do nothing, but don’t be unreasonable or irresponsible in preparing."

WE’RE FUCKING PEOPLE GOD DAMNIT! 

WE ARE HUMAN FUCKING BEINGS!

Why can’t they see that? Why do they hate us so much? How come they would rather their toddlers die than grow up to be one of us.

As an Autistic, I hate the anti-vax movement and the ableist shit bags who started it. I hate anti-vaxxers with the deepest regions of my fucking soul.

There is not enough bile, pestilence, and disease in the world that could adequately match the billowing gurgling hatred I feel for these upper middle class shitravens and the garbage ideology they peddle.

These people turn my heart into an aluminum ball covered in porcupine quills.

They’re termites eating away at an old fungus covered log, they’re rats swimming around a gaseous toxic sewer. They’re like a diseased Frog covered in festering boils hungrily devouring its own offspring.

They’re the real plague. Anti-vaccination advocacy is a sickness of the personality. They resent children with Autism. They resent adults with Autism. And there’s literally nothing us Autistics can do that will make them acknowledge our personhood.

I mean, they just compared us to the fucking coronavirus! AND THEY CONCLUDED THAT OUR EXISTENCE IS WORSE. THEY THINK THAT WE’RE WORSE THAN THE FUCKING CORONAVIRUS. 

Words can not describe how much this rhetoric scares me. There’s already cases of anti-vaccine parents literally killing their Autistic children. And of course they do; with language like THAT, comparing the population of a group of thinking, feeling human beings to a VIRAL PANDEMIC is absolutely dehumanizing and disgusting.

If you are an anti-vaxxer, I hate you. Full stop. Period. If you believe that people with Autism are “sick” or “damaged” I do not want to share even a room with you. Simple as that. Fuck you.

You may say that it’s unfair to judge your entire personality based on one single belief. You know what I say? Fuck you. You don’t even treat me like a person. You call me a plague. You imply that I’m hopeless, and that to be me is a fate worse than Coronavirus, worse than Measles, worse than SARS, worse than Polio; and you have the audacity to call ME disrespectful? To call ME unfair? To say that I’M the one being unreasonable? Am *I* the one who’s completely invalidating someone based on one detail about them? Fuck you. I think your beliefs make you a shitty person. You literally think that I’m a defective human being. 

I am entitled to the right to hate you. I am allowed to think and say what I want about you. If you don’t like it, then become a better person. Stop spreading propaganda that makes parents kill their Autistic children.  But you won’t. You never do.

And don’t EVEN tell me about how you’re the mother of an Autistic child, and that you’re grieving their ‘ruined’ future or whatever. Your Autistic child deserves a better parent. One who actually has their best interests at heart. One who will actually love them, get them proper medical care. One who will treat them like a human being. One who *SEES* them as a fully functional human being.

Again, as someone with Autism, I can’t *IMAGINE* growing up in the family of someone who considers me a ‘case’ in an ‘outbreak.’

And don’t even get me started on the ones who claim they’re doing it for the ‘rights’ of Autistic children as I’ve had an anti-Vaxer condescendingly explain to me. If you view people with Autism as having a ‘condition,’ you are not fighting for our rights. 

Even if you aren’t as extreme as some of the literal eugenicists in the movement, how fucking dare you claim to champion our rights while brushing shoulders with people who think that we should be sterilized and removed. How dare you try and crown yourself our representative while showing us pity at best, and outright contempt at worst.

1.54 million ‘cases’ Jesus fucking Christ. 

I am genuinely struggling to put into words how much I despise these people. It feels like there’s a giant, bile-filled catfish living in my soul; gargling and thrashing about. Just reading these posts turns my stomach into a boiling, tar-filled lagoon.

I’ve spent hours of my life explaining to soccer moms and alternate medicine cranks that I am a person. I have never once convinced them of this. I have never once seen even a shred of empathy from them.

You know what I have seen? Contempt. Hatred. I’ve been told that if Autism means that their children will grow up to act like me, then they would rather their child die.

I’m sorry for such a long rant. It’s just that I’m a human being, and it’s so exhausting having to defend my own personhood to theses people. They will never truly see me as a human being, so they do not deserve my or any Autistic’s respect."

Close to a Million Could Be Tested for the Coronavirus This Week, Health Official Says

Looser regulations on who can conduct tests for the virus will allow for a significant increase in the number of Americans who can be screened, the F.D.A. commissioner said.

By Noah Weiland and Emily Cochrane
March 2, 2020
Updated 10:01 p.m. ET

WASHINGTON — The Trump administration said on Monday that nearly a million tests could be administered for the coronavirus in the United States by the end of this week, a significant escalation of screening as the American death toll reached six and U.S. infections topped 100.

Private companies and academic laboratories have been pulled in to develop and validate their own coronavirus tests, a move to get around a government bottleneck after a halting start, and to widen the range and number of Americans screened for the virus, Dr. Stephen Hahn, the commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration, said Monday at a White House briefing.

The testing expansion comes as the world moves in a more coordinated fashion to confront the virus and its threat to health and the global economy. The Group of 7 industrialized nations is expected to hold an emergency call on Tuesday to synchronize a multinational effort to stimulate economic growth, the first such effort since the global financial crisis more than a decade ago.

The World Bank and the International Monetary Fund signaled they were also ready to provide assistance, particularly to poor nations. Monetary policymakers from Japan to Europe on Monday pledged to act as needed to stem any economic fallout as infections spread. And U.S. stock prices soared, in part on expectations that the Federal Reserve Board could soon cut interest rates.
“We’re very excited about that,” President Trump said on Monday afternoon on his way to a campaign rally in North Carolina. “Our country is in great shape.”

But the virus’s spread was gaining speed, exceeding 90,000 infections and 3,000 deaths worldwide. An expansion of testing in the United States would undoubtedly raise the number of confirmed infections, administration officials said. King County, Wash., where four residents of a single nursing home have died, declared an emergency on Monday, and with more than a dozen schools in the region closed, the virus’s effect was beginning to be felt more broadly.

“We expect to have a substantial increase in the number of tests this week, next week and throughout the month,” Dr. Hahn said, flanked by Vice President Mike Pence and top federal health officials.

White House officials tried to project calm. “The risk to the American people of the coronavirus remains low,” Mr. Pence, who oversees the Trump administration’s coronavirus efforts, told reporters at the White House.

Those reassurances contrasted with warnings delivered on Monday by top officials across the federal government. Officials at the F.D.A. and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention told congressional staff that the coronavirus death rate “won’t be as bad as the Spanish flu of 1918,” which killed as many as 50 million people worldwide, according to one person on the call and a person briefed on the discussion.
In the briefing, which was conducted by phone, the officials said that only 337 additional C.D.C. test kits were made available for distribution on Tuesday and Wednesday, according to two people on the call and the person briefed on the discussion who were not authorized to discuss it publicly. Each of those tests would cover about 350 people, officials said.


The officials added that they hoped that a private manufacturer could step in and provide 2,500 more kits by the end of the week. A spokesman for the Department of Health and Human Services said that public health labs currently can test 15,000 people, and could test up to 75,000 by the end of the week, numbers that fall well short of what Dr. Hahn indicated private labs could handle.

Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said in an interview with NBC on Monday that the virus had “reached outbreak proportions and likely pandemic proportions.”

Yet in several appearances on Monday at the White House, the president continued minimizing the risks of the outbreak.

In an Oval Office meeting with President Iván Duque Márquez of Colombia, Mr. Trump suggested that there could be a “cure” for the new coronavirus. But that assertion has been widely disputed by scientists, who have warned the public that it could linger globally for many years without one, much like the common cold, a closely related illness. The president also claimed that there were “not very many” cases of the coronavirus in the United States.

Later Monday, at a meeting with pharmaceutical executives, Mr. Trump said that “we will continue to do exactly what we’re doing,” even as he hinted that he may announce new travel restrictions from a number of unnamed nations. Mr. Pence said that the Trump administration would screen all travelers on direct flights to the United States from Italy and South Korea, where thousands of coronavirus cases have appeared in recent weeks."

The uncertainty that it is creating is also likely to affect domestic spending. As a result, GDP growth in the March quarter is likely to be noticeably weaker than earlier expected. Given the evolving situation, it is difficult to predict how large and long-lasting the effect will be. Once the coronavirus is contained, the Australian economy is expected to return to an improving trend. This outlook is supported by the low level of interest rates, high levels of spending on infrastructure, the lower exchange rate, a positive outlook for the resources sector and expected recoveries in residential construction and household consumption. The Australian Government has also indicated that it will assist areas of the economy most affected by the coronavirus.” 

They say central banks often take the path of least regret (according to AFR this morning at least). 

Will be interesting if that will be enough combined with what ever stimulus the government announces.

They asked me if it was because of the coronavirus, I said yes, and they issued a full refund immediately.  I talked to a very nice woman, and it took about three minutes total, once I got on the phone with them.

I ALSO called about my rail passes/limousine bus/pocket wifi, and the pocket wifi was refunded, the limousine bus will be a 10% fee, and the rail pass will be a 15% fee.  The person I talked to told me to check back in a couple of weeks, as it sounded like they might be waiving these fees.  So, if you're not in a rush to return those (they are valid up to a year), it might be worth holding off for a little bit, especially if you're in a big group.

I created a power-law model for the death probability as a function of days-since-diagnosis.  I then did a least-squares fit of the model against the death statistics and achieved a very good fit.  My model indicates that among the population that tests positive, 4.12% will not survive 30 days from the diagnosis

Some comments:

* I am not accounting for the large population of people who are infected but have not been tested.  I don't think the frequently quoted 2.3% does either.  I am just modeling the fatality rate among the people who have tested positive, since that's the only data we have
* I do not account for relevant parameters like age, location, preexisting co-morbidity factors, etc.  So this model is not useful for predicting the response of an individual, but appears to be accurate for the entire population of confirmed cases.
* The dataset is the[Johns Hopkins data](https://data.humdata.org/dataset/novel-coronavirus-2019-ncov-cases)
* I do a scaling correction for the pre-2/14 confirmed cases to account for the classification methodology change by China on 2/14

Question: Why is this not a better method than just the ratio of deaths/confirmed?

Update 2-27-20 3:42PM CST:
It’s been 24 hrs so let’s bring this full circle. That last post really made the rounds and it sparked a lot of opinions, emotions, and touched some tender spots. Unfortunately it spawned some rather personal commentary too.

Just to give you some history, we have actually experienced people report their illegal drugs being stolen, being ripped off in a drug deal, being sold a look-a-like illegal substance, etc. We have even experienced drunk drivers coming to pick up arrested drunk drivers as their ""sober responsible party"". So this attempt, although a long shot, still had some possibility behind it. We will take those easy grabs at removing poison from our community whenever we can. That is our role which we un-apologetically must fulfill. It is our hope that an arrest would be the positive catalyst someone may need to start recovery. It is our hope that every drug arrest both works to hold offenders accountable for their deeds and provides them with a path toward treatment options. It is truly heart-warming when we see people succeed in such circumstances. It does happen!
The previous post commentary was filled with experiences, expertise, successes, fears, and much more. It's all good conversation and, we hope, catalyst for getting people into a better place. If you know anyone that needs some help in this community there is a local resource guide attached. If you or someone else need a hand, a phone, or just a little help taking that step, WE ARE ALWAYS HERE FOR YOU!

Managing and mitigating the spread of disease is really something that requires some amount of central governance. Individuals can't be counted on to act in their own interests and, more importantly, pose health risks to each other just by going about their lives. The private sector doesn't have the market motivation nor the needed authority to set and enforce good public health policies. Especially since good epidemiology is proactive and tries to get out ahead of diseases to contain them and not just swoop in once everyone is sick/dying."

China is only slowing the rate of infection down because they shut down a lot of their economy. A few weeks after people start going back to work, you can expect it to explode again, especially with the long incubation period. The White House has ordered gag orders on top doctors, and the WHO has ordered large social media companies such as Facebook, Twitter, Google, etc. to censor ""rumors"" and ""fearmongering"" that keep turning out to be true. Even Reddit received said marching orders, and they quarantined a coronavirus subreddit that we aren't even allowed to mention due to potential ""misinformation.""

You will notice it’s all about how corporations and governments should work together to protect the economy. For example, number 3 says that border closures and stopping flights should be avoided at all costs to protect the economy. They have a point that the economy is important and that a breakdown in supply lines could be dangerous, but I can’t help but think that they are putting percentage points on stock market investment portfolios over human lives.

Usually you don’t want to use steroids too much during infections because steroids suppress your immune response, but with inhaled steroids maybe they think that there will be little systemic absorption and you can reduce inflammation locally in the lungs.

I am a bit suspicious of this. It seems like normal supportive care for pneumonia would be sufficient as I perceive there to be risks involved with administering a steroid in this situation and the steroid most certainly does not cure the infection at all. If anything I would think it would delay resolution. While systemic absorption is definitely reduced by going the inhalation route, the site of infection is the lungs and so I think the point is moot. Wish the case report was in English so I could read more about it.

Take it with a grain of salt because I don’t work in ID.

But as I just said on an Atlanta post, it's being super dramaticized by the media because of a lack of medication to fight it. 

Look at how people around you are talking about it. I keep hearing from people about ""The Coronavirus is coming!"" 

It's not The Coronavirus, it's A Coronavirus, specifically called COVID-19. There are multiple strains of this virus out there and people have probably had a previous strain before when they had the flu. 

More people die from the normal strands of the flu than this strain every year. 

Its affecting 0.0005 percent of Chinas population and slowly but surely about to be contained there, where 90 percent of the cases exist. 

It won't spread quickly elsewhere because the people who are finding out they have it are being quarantined and they probably don't interact with a huge number of people per day to spread it quickly. 

It spread in that Chinese city because it broke out there at the food market where many people went to. 

Mostly old people and those with preexisting conditions are dying from it. More people are recovering just fine than anything, like with the usual strains of the flu. 

Wash your hands often, stay away from sick people and their coughs and sneezes, and use germ-x.

You should have all the information before you make a decision, so please read this carefully.

First, you should know that confirmation of employment is, under Japanese labor law, the same as a legal contract. That means if you show up in Japan on the date you were originally asked to be here, the company is legally obligated to employ you as per their original offer.

In addition, Japanese labor law mandates that companies give employees 60% of their salary if the company asks the employee not to come to work. See this post to find out if you may be eligible: [http://www.generalunion.org/featured/88-english-root/other/information-and-rights-at-work/2254-coronavirus-update-2137-on-thursday-27-february](http://www.generalunion.org/featured/88-english-root/other/information-and-rights-at-work/2254-coronavirus-update-2137-on-thursday-27-february)

However.

It is highly likely the company will try to lie and try to manipulate their way out of the contract so as to avoid being obligated to pay you during this period. In order to get the money you are owed, you would have to sue them in labor court. This is not easy, especially when you don't speak Japanese and don't know the system; and it takes a LONG time - up to five months, in my personal experience.

I would suggest, then, that you not come to Japan at this time.

You are highly unlikely to find another job, because the corona outbreak has destabilized many industries, in particular English teaching, because parents are keeping their kids at home as the government has suggested schools close. This means most parents won't be sending their kids to English school, either.

People are \*very\* paranoid right now, and many are even panic-buying. If things worsen, and I suspect they will, the government will make school closings mandatory.  That would mean companies are no longer obligated to pay you, and as a newbie, you could even be let go entirely.

Never forget this point: language teaching companies in Japan are \*all\* SHADY AF and employ all kinds of manipulative and dirty business practices to reap profits and take advantage of the young grads (like you) whom they recruit from overseas.

If I were you, I'd wait at least a month to see if the situation improves. Otherwise, you'll find yourself in a foreign country jobless and maybe homeless (if the company provides your apartment, you won't be able to live in it).

For context, I have been living in Japan for nearly 30 years, and have seen it all. Trust me on this - if your company tells you not to come, don't do it."

The next time someone says ""the flu is much worse"", ask them how bad the flu is. If they give you a number like ""50,000 deaths per year"" or whatever, tell them that that's the wrong answer because you need to know how many people are infected before that is meaningful. Explain that if 50,000 people get the flu and 50,000 die, that's very different from if 500,000,000 get the flu and 50,000 die. 

After walking them through those stats, ask them how many people have died of coronavirus. Then ask them how many people got infected. Then ask them how those two numbers compare.

And then point out that the flu stat is yearly and the coronavirus stat is monthly

And then point out how exponential growth works (ie if we see 5000 deaths in march, we should not expect to see 5000 deaths in april, more like 50,000 (number (probably) exaggerated for effect))"

Twitter thread:

https://twitter.com/firefoxx66/status/1233666678841597952?s=21

It is important that we are doing all we can as contributing members of society to help mitigate strain on healthcare systems and supply chains so they function as well as possible to help those who need it. Getting the flu shot could prevent you from needing medical attention that will be strained with an influx of covid-19 patients. Buying small quantities of food here and there for 3 days supply, (not a week or a month) will be absorbed into our supply chain without causing shortages. It will also prevent you from needing to go to the store filled with people during panic buying. 

I don’t blame people reacting on their anxiety, it is hard not to, but if we all succumb to it can be paralyzing and unhelpful to ourselves and society. You don’t need bottled water. Our water treatment will not be affected. You don’t need 50 rolls of toilet paper. 



TLDR; don’t do nothing, but don’t be unreasonable or irresponsible in preparing."

>Median time from symptom onset to ARDS = 9 days

>Median time from symptom onset to ICU admission = 10.5 days

>Median time from symptom onset to mechanical ventilation = 10.5 days

The incubation period is around 5 days, therefore it takes 2 weeks from infection to ICU. The ICU number we are looking at now is based on the cases 2 weeks ago. From this data we can also guess the minimum median time from symptom unset to death is 10.5 days.

https://www.healio.com/infectious-disease/emerging-diseases/news/online/%7B686f7316-c3e1-454d-971e-b131b74c388a%7D/evidence-shows-human-transmission-of-coronavirus-since-mid-december

It takes 7 days to double the infected, If there was 1 patient 6 weeks ago, there would be 16 patients 2 weeks ago, among whom 1 need ICU.

With current death number (6 in total) and mortality rate (using the one for older population with underlying conditions, 10%), there was 60 people infected 2 weeks ago (240 by now), and 4 people infected 6 weeks ago."

2020-03-02,ExcellentWeather,berkeley,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/fchf2q/189_coronavirus_email/fjbmlcc/,"That's what I've been saying. He is taking all of the upper limits for the estimations and citing them as facts without any sources. As you say, the WHO has reported a much more likely R0 of around 2. This is also the widely accepted number - I have no idea where this professor got his from. He also deliberately calls out the outlier cases (the 29 year old doctor, for example). In South Korea, which has had a better chance to gain comprehensive data on the outbreak, only one person below the age of 40 has died. He was 35 and already had a chronic liver disease before getting the coronavirus. 

As for his supposed timeline of symptoms, much of it is speculation and, again, uses the worst estimations. 

I've been watching this thing since early January and have talked to one of the infectious disease professors extensively on the matter. To see someone come out like this and exaggerate the point so extensively is disheartening and does nothing productive beside call attention to it.

This is not to say the nation's, state's, or school's responses are at all acceptable. The number of people we, as a nation, have tested for the virus is utterly appalling. We either should have already canceled classes and there should be more people under quarantine or we shouldn't be worried at all at this point. But instead our government opted to stick its head in the sand and pretend everything was going to be alright in the face of overwhelmingly contrary evidence and professional opinion. It is upon their shoulders that the eventual blame for this all must rest. 

As for the school, what do you all propose they do instead? Cancel classes before it's confirmed the virus is here and you act in direct contradiction to what the state and federal governments are advising. And if we, the number one public university in the world, subscribe to simple fear mongering then what is the rest of the country supposed to do? All we can do now is prepare and to hope that by some miracle is doesn't get here. And that sucks, it really does. Nobody wants to sit and wait in fear of the unknown. But we have to acknowledge that this is a more complex issue and can not be remedied by a blanket postponing of the semester. 

Appendix of my own: 

As of this morning, 4,212 people have been infected in South Korea and 22 have died. That brings the fatality rate all the way up to a whopping 0.5%. The vast majority of these, 15 of them, were people who were older than 60 and many of them had underlying conditions. 

Italy has fared a bit worse in terms of deaths, with 2,040 confirmed cases and 52 deaths. This is the 2.5% fatality rate which seems to be the much more agreed upon number. Again, many of these deaths are from the elderly or from those with preexisting conditions. At this point, though, I'd like to stress the importance of mild and non-reported cases. It's quite likely the number of infected is far, far above that. While disturbing in its own way, that would imply the mortality rate is far lower. 

And as for the data which shows the virus has already been spreading in American communities for a few weeks, which seems very likely, it again only shows the possible mildness of the disease. It's utterly abhorrent that the government has allowed it to spread unchecked for so long, but if so many have gotten in and yet so few have died from it, some silver lining may be seen. 

I'd also like to point out that respiratory diseases as a whole tend to die out with warmer weather and in general as summer comes. It's why there are flu/cold seasons. We're not entirely sure why it happens (there are many convincing theories, but it doesn't much matter for us), but you might be able to find some hope in that as well. 

So yes, be worried. Maybe not for yourselves, if that may be the case, but at least for your parents and grandparents. Wash your hands thoroughly and regularly.

But nobody really says what they mean. Maybe you can elaborate?

People are transmitting the disease before they show symptoms. Do you mean for everyone to avoid all human contact for next 6-8 weeks or longer? Most people can't do that, for a lot of reasons. Very few people have two months of food for their family stored, and attempting to get that now would... Expose you to the virus, potentially, and result in extreme shortages as local stores are not equipped to handle that level of demand.

Most people can't afford to not work for that long, but even if they could, that would have serious consequences. My mom is a nurse, my sister is a nurse, my wife is a veterinarian and my brother in law is a surgeon... If they all stop working for two months, a lot of things will die. There are lots and lots of jobs that, collectively, are critical for society to function. The harm of not doing these jobs outweigh the harm of the coronavirus, based on what we know about it.

There are already confirmed reports all over the US and almost certainly many times more that simply weren't tested or didn't have symptoms. It was likely already in the US before anyone in China knew what they had. Roughly 8,000 Americans visit China in any given day, and I would guess a lot of Chinese visit the US every day too.

Even if we had shut down all the US borders as soon as the first report from China came in, we might still have the same problem we do now.

What changes do you advocate? The same basic, 'anti-flu' stuff we all hear each year? Wash hands, cover your mouth, get plenty of sleep, stay home if you feel sick, etc etc? Because, most people already do that, to the degree that they are able."

>Mohammad Mirmohammadi , a member of a top council that advises Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei, died Monday of Covid-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus. His death follows those of two other Iranian leaders — a former ambassador and newly elected member of Parliament — who also succumbed to the illness.

>Reports indicate there are a total of about seven top officials who are sick, including Iraj Harirchi, the head of the regime’s coronavirus task force, and Iranian Vice President Masoumeh Ebtekar.

>The disclosure of Ebtekar’s illness last week was particularly troubling for Iran’s leadership, as it came only one day after she attended a Cabinet meeting where she was in close proximity to regime officials, including the 80-year-old Khamenei. That he and other Iranian leaders are elderly means they are at increased risk of dying from the disease, though there is currently no evidence to show Khamenei is sick.

>Still, it’s clear the Iranian government is in crisis even as it contends with nearly 1,000 confirmed cases of coronavirus in the country. It’s gotten so bad that Minister of Foreign Affairs Javad Zarif has tweeted out calls for assistance, asking for medical equipment to help treat the nation’s outbreak. On Monday, three European countries offered about 5 million euros in support, but it’s unclear if that will make a big difference at this point. The US has also offered to help , though its sanctions on the country remain.

>That the virus has been able to spread to the highest levels of Iran’s government is further evidence of the country’s astonishing failure to manage the outbreak so far.

>“It’s symptomatic of the revolutionary state’s highly ideological and often inept approach to governance,” Suzanne Maloney, an Iran expert at the Brookings Institution, told me. “What’s maddening is that Iran has enormous scientific capabilities and a well regarded public health system. So this is entirely a leadership failure.”

>Indeed, as the number of confirmed infections ticked upward in recent weeks, Tehran either didn’t understand the severity of the problem or, more likely, quashed evidence of the outbreak altogether . 
>The lack of alarm allowed hundreds to go untreated in Iran, while millions of workers, religious pilgrims, and others who travel to and from the country every day likely continued to spread the disease.

>Which means Iran’s problems — as bad as they are — are only likely to get worse."

We advised that early reports are often frantic and incomplete, and that noise level wouldn’t necessarily match risk level, and that if the CDC says don’t worry, don’t worry. This week, after a CDC official told the press and the public to prepare for ""significant disruption of our lives,"" that script flipped. 

Such a disruption here would come as a shock to many Americans. Not so for Pulitzer Prize–winning science writer Laurie Garrett, author of The Coming Plague, who has observed many outbreaks up close, and whose mission lately is to inform her fellow Americans about the nature of contagions and to provide fact-based advice to a people more accustomed to being, as she calls them, “epidemic voyeurs.” In this segment, Brooke and Garrett discuss what to expect as COVID-19 makes its way through a ruptured body politic, caught off-guard. 

Further reading: ""The Wuhan Virus: How To Stay Safe,"" by Laurie Garrett, published by Foreign Policy on January 25, 2020. Garrett also recommends reading coronavirus coverage and commentary from STAT's Helen Branswell, Science Mag's Jon Cohen and Kai Kupferschmidt, and John Hopkins's Tom Inglesby.

Five Dallas police officers have been told to stay home after potentially being exposed to a man with possible coronavirus on Sunday.

At about 9 a.m., Dallas officers responded to a disturbance call at an apartment in the 5900 block of Hudson Street in East Dallas. When officers arrived, Dallas Fire and Rescue had taken a 24-year-old man to a local hospital for injuries he sustained from an assault, according to a Dallas police statement.

Medical staff treated the man and released him back to Dallas officers, who drove him to jail and charged him with assault of a family member, police said.

At around 10:30 p.m., jail officers notified Dallas police of a possible case of COVID-19 involving the man, who was taken by private ambulance to Parkland Hospital.

“Per our contagious disease policy, all five officers that came in contact with the arrested person were notified of the potential exposure and advised not to return to work until further notice,” the police statement said.

The police cars involved were immediately removed from service for cleaning, police said.

Members of the department are currently working with medical professionals to draft a protocol to ensure officer safety.”"

1) Is the virus a concern on my clothes? Like if I go in public and make contact with other people, could I conceivably catch the virus from clothes after I get home from work? Does washing the clothes resolve this?

2) I know that touching my face is off limits, but how do I handle the (frequent) itchy nose/booger?

>Even though Taiwan has not been kept officially informed by the WHO about the epidemic, the Taiwanese government promptly undertook measures to [prevent the spread of the virus](https://international.thenewslens.com/article/130867) in Taiwan in late December last year, and organized the Central Epidemic Command Center (CECC) in January 2020. Since the set-up of the CECC, it has been [holding a press conference](https://www.straitstimes.com/asia/east-asia/coronavirus-taiwan-to-pass-bill-to-lessen-impact-of-outbreak) almost every day to announce the latest policy and information on the epidemic, and to clarify rumors that are circulating on social media. The Taiwanese government also uses digital tools to communicate with the public amid the virus outbreak. For example, Taiwan’s Ministry of Health and Welfare and many Taiwanese politicians of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) have used their official social media accounts on outlets like Facebook, LINE, and YouTube to keep the public well informed on everything from the number of available face masks to the updated policy.  
>  
>Taiwan’s active civil society also plays a critical role in this crisis. To save people time in looking for stores selling face masks, a Taiwanese software engineer [built an online real-time map](https://www.straitstimes.com/asia/east-asia/health-minister-gains-fans-even-as-taiwan-grapples-with-evacuation-quandary-new) that can show where masks are stocked in convenience stores and drugstores across the island. Following this idea, Digital Minister Audrey Tang, a coordinator between the government and private sector, rapidly developed a better version of the information platform with government data.  
>  
>Another case of civic participation is the engagement of Taiwanese fact-check institutions and groups, including Taiwan FactCheck Center (TFC) and MyGoPen. They make an effort to fact-check and correct disinformation or misinformation on the epidemic, which mostly circulates online, meanwhile disseminating the right information to the public as third-party independent institutions.  
>  
>Armed with transparent and sufficient information on the coronavirus epidemic, Taiwanese people actively follow the government’s policies and take actions to curb the spread of virus individually by washing hands and wearing masks. Therefore, even though the self-ruled island is very close to China, the number of infection cases in Taiwan is still low (32 cases, as of February 26) compared to neighboring countries like South Korea (1,261 cases) and Japan (885 cases). Even though the [community spread of the virus](https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/3878832) in Taiwan is looming and seems inevitable, the Taiwanese government and people have shown that they are determined to work together to fight against COVID-19.  
>  
>[Some might argue](https://www.insider.com/chinese-tech-companies-artificial-intelligence-surveillance-coronavirus-2020-2) that China, as the digital authoritarian powerhouse, has the cutting-edge AI technology and surveillance system to track all its people, not to mention infectious patients. Indeed, these [high-tech tools](https://edition.cnn.com/2020/02/23/tech/china-tech-coronavirus-outbreak/index.html) are used to monitor and surveil people in the cities under lockdown. But that does not translate to public knowledge. As the number of infectious cases climbs, China’s government ramped up propaganda, covering pro-government and pro-Chinese Communist Party stories, rather than communicating with the public. Due to the lack of transparency and accountability, the authoritarian regime’s propaganda and regulatory departments tend to take actions to censor and control information. And the results prove that this is definitely not the best public health strategy.  
>  
>To counter and control a viral epidemic, both government and civil society need sufficient information. The characteristics of a democratic society are openness and transparency, which promise the public access to information. On the other hand, a democratic government also has to take responsibility for communicating with people because leaders are accountable to the public. Only when we ensure the free flow of information in a democracy can we construct [a healthy society](https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/guest-blog/the-free-flow-of-scientific-information-is-critical-for-democracy/). Besides its strong public health infrastructure, Taiwan proves that the democratic strategy is successful in curbing the spread of the new coronavirus – which is why Taiwan is outperforming its authoritarian neighbor, China."

>**Evangelicals consider ""very serious"" that Health pointed to a religious group as a possible focus**

>Spanish evangelicals consider “very serious” that a group of their religious confession has been “pointed out” by the Ministry of Health, because they consider that it leaves [all of] them in a state of “defenselessness and signaling”.

>As they have indicated to Europa Press sources of the Federation of Evangelical Religious Entities of Spain (FEREDE), ""pointing"" to an evangelical group leaves them in a ""state of defenselessness and signaling"" because it extends a ""cloak of suspicion"" over Evangelical churches.

>Spanish evangelicals understand that this statement may be due to ""media pressure"" to offer news about the spread of the coronavirus in Spain. Although, they do not believe that this justifies it and they request “responsibilities” to the authorities or some type of “apology”.

The fact that you are a Massive Dickhead is irrelevant here, and I’m not really sure why you needed to mention it.

The reason why people are freaking out about it (and I’ll put this in terms that even a Massive Dickhead) can understand, is thus:

1. Coronavirus is MANY TIMES more contagious than the flu. This means that more people will catch it.

2. If more people catch it, then it starts to grow exponentially - especially since there are no symptoms at first.

3. Because of the shitty state of the US economy which has ensured that low paid service workers don’t get sick leave, they will keep coming into work and infect more people.

4. Who will infect more people.

5. Some of these people (by no means all) will then be hospitalized and face bills they can’t afford (Trump is actively destroying the health care system).

6. As more and more people get infected, more and more businesses will shut (I live in Asia and formerly busy places are going out of business like crazy).

AAPL calls at open didn't get in before RH went $ROPE. 

Remain fairly convinced this'll be a short-term bounce followed by another significant leg down, but given the 10 yr shifts and worldwide CB action -- and little market reaction to 100 infected, 6 dead today vs. AAPL getting an analyst upgrade -- I'm less sure the next leg down will be within 2-4 weeks. April earnings could be rough but I don't think would set the market to lows. 

Based on current projections, I expect Biden to win Tuesday, so looking at green to horizontal this week barring bad news. Could see a dip starting at the end of the week due to weekend uncertainty, but if China really is on the other side of coronavirus (as the market wants to believe), the CBs may be able to buy our way to summer. May GLD calls, April/May SPY, AAPL puts, weekly/monthly SPY/AAPL/QQQ calls, May TSLA calls. 

Otherwise, continuing to put 25% of profits in SCHB to go into long-term investing, and 25% in SWAN (which becomes my backup source of cash when positions I like dip). Has worked well so far."

Out of the 1,000 cases of Coronavirus you identify 970. However, because you tested 50 million people with cold viruses, your total pool of false positives from those tests is 1.5 million. This means that a positive test result means that person only has a 970/1.501 million chance of actually having Coronavirus. A positive test means there's a 0.06% chance you actually have the virus.

Translation of NHK story:

""The Japanese Association for Infectious Diseases (JAID) have published a report on their website detailing the symptomatic improvement and recovery seen following administration of inhaler-type medication used in the treatment of asthma to patients suffering from pneumonia as a result of the novel coronavirus.

The report is being published to the JAID website by a group which includes Kanagawa prefectural Ashigarakami hospital, one of the facilities that has carried out treatment on passengers of the cruiseliner Diamond Princess, which saw a mass outbreak of the novel coronavirus.

According to the report three patients suffering pneumonia and confirmed by PCR testing to be infected with the novel coronavirus were administered, upon their consent, an immunosuppressive inhaled steroid *Ciclesonide* typically used in the treatment of asthma.

Of the three all were over the ages of 65, and though not in critical condition all were receiving supplemental oxygen. However, after Ciclesonide treatment was administered on February 20th, noticeable improvements were seen within two days and a 73-year-old female patient has since been discharged in good health.

The clinical group has stated choosing the treatment protocol based on information received from the National Institute of Infectious Diseases, with the hope that by aerosol delivery it will prove effective in suppressing the severe inflammation in the lung tissue where the virus prevalently grows. 

The group says that their findings can't yet be fully evaluated with the small number of patients, and plans to partner with other healthcare facilities going forward to investigate the results further."""

Politicians also interact with public a lot. Their aids constantly interact with public. So even if they try to minimize personal interaction, they're only 1 degree separated. This is an election year. 

So seems feasible our political class could have close to 100 percent infection rate in next year if population in general is infected at 60 percent. 

So seems feasible that 20 to 40 percent of Congress and administration could be hospitalized in next year with about 4 to 8 percent passing away?

I made no changes to my 401k last week, it's got ongoing contributions to a stock-heavy portfolio.  I made some active purchases with my self-managed account last week.  I held back a good amount of money though.  With regard to the self-managed portfolio, I've got a lot in cash right now, but I've also got cash earmarked for expenses for the year (wife is giving birth in a few months).

The CDC has confirmed person-to-person transmission in the U.S., but notes that so far, the virus is not spreading in the community here.

> Doctors say the most important route of transmission is likely close contact (six feet or less) with sick patients who spread respiratory droplets when they cough or sneeze. The risk of spread from asymptomatic people and from touching surfaces and objects contaminated with virus is much lower than droplets spread from sick patients.
