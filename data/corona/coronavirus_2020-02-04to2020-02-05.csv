If the coronavirus issue passes with little pain in your home country,  that's great,  and maybe the new folks will learn some of the value in being prepared.

Personally I'm not nearly as worried about getting the virus as I am about disruption in our supply chain.   It's terrifying to have validated how many of our daily supplies come from China and it is very likely that if the virus cannot be contained it will be years before they are back to full production.

Secondly, the Chinese govt is untrustworthy and we simply cannot trust the information they give us, nor our own media. This was proven when we were told the burning of bodies was fake news and fear mongering since we now know they have indeed been burning the dead.

Washing hands and sneezing into elbows is... ineffective. People who are dealing with the virus first hand are in hazmat suits. The best way to prevent transmission is to get the fuck away from people who have it, and keep those who have it the fuck away from everyone else.

The last two points may as well have been written by an intern at vox. Its not racism or xenophobic, its preventative measures from potential plague-level situations. The nation where it originated is barring people inside their homes and arresting people without masks as well as whistleblowers.

It was the second death from the new coronavirus outside mainland China and brought the toll from the fast-spreading outbreak to 427.

""It is important that the public health authorities in Ireland are well prepared. I spoke to Tony Holohan, the Chief Medical Officer, a few days ago, looking at Ireland's preparations. Ireland did a very good job during the last SARS epidemic. They were able to host the Special Olympics slap bang in the middle of a SARS crisis and they did that extremely well.""

Dr Ryan said the spread of the coronavirus ""does not constitute a pandemic"" because he said the transmission intensity has not been seen outside of Wuhan and Hubei province.

""There are still so many unknowns. It is unclear why the disease has behaved the way it has despite the massive efforts made by China. It is still way too early to declare defeat in the face of trying to stop the virus. We believe the virus can still be contained and at a very minimum slowed down to allow us to be prepared with the drugs and vaccines to combat it.""

Earlier, the World Health Organization said that the outbreak of the deadly novel coronavirus, which has spread from China to two dozen countries, does not yet constitute a ""pandemic"".

""Currently we are not in a pandemic,"" Sylvie Briand, head of WHO's Global Infectious Hazard Preparedness division, told reporters in Geneva.

Instead, she said, ""we are at the phase where it is an epidemic with multiple foci.""

The disease has killed more than 425 people and infected a further 20,000 in China, nearly all of them in central Hubei province - the centre of the outbreak - and spread to two-dozen countries since it emerged in December.

Ms Briand said that while there is rapid spread of transmission in Hubei, outside the province there are mainly ""spillover cases"" with sporadic clusters of transmission.

""In these other places in China, the strategy currently is to stop transmission,"" she said, adding that the same was true for affected countries outside of China.

""We would like to make sure that we don't have a second Hubei type of scenario,"" she said."

If it does anything, it will get less fatal over time

>But SARS has a molecular proofreading system that reduces its mutation rate, and the new coronavirus’s similarity to SARS at the genomic level suggests it does, too. “That makes the mutation rate much, much lower than for flu or HIV,” Farzan said. That lowers the chance that the virus will evolve in some catastrophic way to, say, become significantly more lethal.

>The coronavirus “may not change [genetically] at all” in a way that alters function, said biologist Andrew Rambaut of the University of Edinburgh, who has been analyzing the genomes of the 2019-nCoV’s from dozens of patients. “It is transmitting quite well already so it may not have to ‘evolve’ to be endemic.”

>Any evolution that does take place in an endemic coronavirus, including one that spikes seasonally, might well be toward less virulence. “It doesn’t want to kill you before you transmit it,” Farzan said. “One would therefore expect a slow attenuation” of virulence if the virus becomes like seasonal flu. Dead people don’t transmit viruses, “and even people sitting in their beds and shivering” because they are seriously ill “don’t transmit that well,” he said.

(edit... SARS not H1N1, although H1N1 is another low mutation rate virus, for what its worth.)"

There are seven other coronaviruses in humans, and four cause the common cold. (The other two are MERS and SARS).

Viruses usually evolve over time to be less deadly to the host, as the virus is just a replicator. Killing you is a side effect of replicating, and generally if the virus is too lethal, it doesn't spread as well. So it's theoretically possible for 2019-nCoV to evolve into an endemic disease like the common cold or flu.

So the short answer is that it's definitely possible this is how the common cold started but we don't know for sure."

The two doctors I went to see looked at me like I was crazy even though I showed all the symptoms  and brought my passport and the news articles stating the virus was discovered on the island when I was there. One doctor even had to google Zika and reference the Mayo clinic on symptoms, then told me to go home and take ibuprofen too. 

I then contacted a scientist at a local university here who had been quoted in the newspaper about his team creating a vaccine for Zika and asked what I should do or if he needed volunteers to study and was brushed off AGAIN. 

My concern was that we were trying to start a family and we should wait to get the all clear but the doctors told me not to worry about it. We waited two and a half years anyway and I still had a miscarriage  (but I think and hope it was due to other extenuating circumstances rather than Zika.)

(Reuters) - The European Medicines Agency (EMA) said it was taking steps to speed up the development of vaccines and treatments to combat the new coronavirus that has killed more than 400 people.

The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared the flu-like virus a global emergency and experts say much is still unknown, including its mortality rate and transmission routes.

“EMA is ready to support medicine developers with all available regulatory tools to advance and expedite the development of effective measures to fight and prevent the spread of this virus,” the agency said.

It said it was looking for potential antivirals or vaccines to treat or prevent the virus outbreak and that it was analyzing all available information on developers’ drug pipelines.

British drugmaker GlaxoSmithKline ([GSK.L](https://www.reuters.com/companies/GSK.L)) has said it was working with the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI) in an effort to develop a vaccine.

“EMA has activated its plan for managing emerging health threats,” EMA Executive Director Guido Rasi said, adding that the agency would provide fast-track scientific advice and give prompt feedback on any proposed medicine developments."

Not in China/Hong Kong. Hong Kong and Singapore Disney have closed. The Casinos in Macau are closed. Theaters closed. Etc. Etc. Etc.  

Then look at all the cruise ships banning China Nationals or people recently in China. 

But realistically, its too early to tell. I think things will get worse in the coming weeks, and its a big question mark on if things will settle by the summer or if it will spread further. If it does spread further there then could be concerns of the Tokyo Summer Olympics. 

Then there are the fears of an economic downturn the longer this Virus lasts. Smaller businesses that rely on Chinese tourists might not survive. Some airlines might have issues as the demand for oil will dip, and if they've paid more for oil for hedge/futures they could be in trouble. Also expect less long hall flights to Asia now and until the market stops feeling the panic once this is all resolved. So less Supply, Less demand might keep prices relatively stable.

> Chinese businesses across the GTA have been reporting slumps in business due to unfound fears of catching the coronavirus. Social media and certain news outlets haven’t helped, spreading misinformation and resurfacing old racist tropes that when it comes to food, Chinese people are dirty, uncivilized and will eat anything including bats, cats or foods that fall outside the norms of Western diets. Last week, The Star reported that Wuhan Noodle 1950 (3621 Hwy 7, Unit 119), a tiny noodle shop in the Liberty Square plaza/office complex in Markham, was getting inundated with prank calls and was the subject of memes and racist videos shared on social media. I felt inclined to give the business a bit of a boost this past weekend, and it turns out I wasn’t the only one.

Sauce:  [https://news.llu.edu/health-wellness/flu-2020-there-time-still-get-shot](https://news.llu.edu/health-wellness/flu-2020-there-time-still-get-shot) 

That's a little more than 0.0005% mortality rate.

The Lancet (probably THE most trustworthy medical source) reported that in contrast, they estimate 75,000 have been infected, and we know that at least 426 people have died (number is likely MUCH higher). That works out to 0.005%.

So, if only 15,000,000 get this (keep in mind, the vast majority of people get the flu vaccine - there is no coronavirus vaccine), then we'll see at least 75,000 deaths.

There's two kinds generally, a very fine grain usually in green, and a rougher grain.  They're usually used in flower arrangements, the wire pokes into the foam and gets held.  The finer grain foam gets dusty after use, the bigger grain foam has much less dust from poking sticks in and out over and over.

Basically this:

In a statement to RTÉ News this evening, the department said that citizens should contact their travel agency or airline regarding available routes out of China before any further restrictions may be imposed.

It comes as China has adopted what is described as ""forceful measures"" to halt the spread of the coronavirus, according to China's envoy to the United Nations.

The department said that the situation remains very fluid and it is likely that increasing containment measures will be deployed by the Chinese government.

It said that due to this environment, the advice of the department is ""to avoid non-essential travel to and within China"".

Citizens with underlying medical conditions should not travel to China at this time, the department also said.

The Executive Director of the World Health Organization's Health Emergencies Programme has said he has been speaking with public health authorities here in relation to Ireland's preparations for the coronavirus.

Speaking on RTÉ's Drivetime, Dr Mike Ryan said he was in contact with Ireland's Chief Medical Officer, Tony Holohan, a few days ago to look at the country's readiness for the possibility of the disease arriving in Ireland.

Dr Ryan, who is originally from Curry, Co Sligo, said Ireland has proved its ability to deal with incidents like this, as it was able to ""host the Special Olympics during the SARS outbreak""."

As I said on my last post, they are doing RT-PCR tests, basically transcribe the RNA into DNA and multiply it several times so the scientists can “read” it and check if it has the genetic code of coronavirus. But it can give false negatives, if they suspect the sample might have it even being negative, they run a genetic sequencing (100% reliable, but takes more time, is more expensive and can’t test a lot daily).
Next week they will be able to produce about 200,000 RT-qPCR kits daily, they are much more reliable than the current ones.  With the increasing of production, tests becoming more accurate and labs running at max capacity, they will for sure be able to test at least 20x more than now, and that might be enough to test all pending people and then test everyone they suspect daily.

Even CDC is running those tests to confirm their samples though, they have a part of the site specifically to scientists that are doing the tests (public access though) and they admit there that it is possible to have false negatives. Principally due to improper collection, transport, handling.

> Notably, two compounds remdesivir (EC50 = 0.77 μM; CC50 > 100 μM; SI > 129.87) and chloroquine (EC50 = 1.13 μM; CC50 > 100 μM, SI > 88.50) potently blocked virus infection at low-micromolar concentration and showed high SI (Fig. 1a, b).

> Remdesivir has been recently recognized as a promising antiviral drug against a wide array of RNA viruses (including SARS/MERS-CoV5) infection in cultured cells, mice and nonhuman primate (NHP) models. It is currently under clinical development for the treatment of Ebola virus infection.6 Remdesivir is an adenosine analogue, which incorporates into nascent viral RNA chains and results in pre-mature termination.7 Our time-of-addition assay showed remdesivir functioned at a stage post virus entry (Fig. 1c, d), which is in agreement with its putative anti-viral mechanism as a nucleotide analogue. Warren et al. showed that in NHP model, intravenous administration of 10 mg/kg dose of remdesivir resulted in concomitant persistent levels of its active form in the blood (10 μM) and conferred 100% protection against Ebola virus infection.7 Our data showed that EC90 value of remdesivir against 2019-nCoV in Vero E6 cells was 1.76 μM, suggesting its working concentration is likely to be achieved in NHP. Our preliminary data (Supplementary information, Fig. S2) showed that remdesivir also inhibited virus infection efficiently in a human cell line (human liver cancer Huh-7 cells), which is sensitive to 2019-nCoV.2

> Chloroquine, a widely-used anti-malarial and autoimmune disease drug, has recently been reported as a potential broad-spectrum antiviral drug.8,9 Chloroquine is known to block virus infection by increasing endosomal pH required for virus/cell fusion, as well as interfering with the glycosylation of cellular receptors of SARS-CoV.10 Our time-of-addition assay demonstrated that chloroquine functioned at both entry, and at post-entry stages of the 2019-nCoV infection in Vero E6 cells (Fig. 1c, d). Besides its antiviral activity, chloroquine has an immune-modulating activity, which may synergistically enhance its antiviral effect in vivo. Chloroquine is widely distributed in the whole body, including lung, after oral administration. The EC90 value of chloroquine against the 2019-nCoV in Vero E6 cells was 6.90 μM, which can be clinically achievable as demonstrated in the plasma of rheumatoid arthritis patients who received 500 mg administration.11 Chloroquine is a cheap and a safe drug that has been used for more than 70 years and, therefore, it is potentially clinically applicable against the 2019-nCoV.

> Our findings reveal that remdesivir and chloroquine are highly effective in the control of 2019-nCoV infection in vitro. Since these compounds have been used in human patients with a safety track record and shown to be effective against various ailments, we suggest that they should be assessed in human patients suffering from the novel coronavirus disease.

The vaccine is like Nintendo Power for the immune system to give it a heads up on how to defeat the boss, but the immune system will eventually learn without Nintendo Power with enough exposure.

I believe that raising the birth survival rates for children and infants have an exponential effect on human behaviour. Because cultures can now be sure their children survive, their planning for life, especially the number of children they have, drammatically changes. A lot of people joke how no child can survive without vaccines, and that's untrue. In fact, most children can survive without a single vaccination. The difference is that the few % of survival rate difference makes the whole difference in how a society prioritizes its resources.

As a result, I believe a culture with a slightly less security in child survivability will take actions that will drastically lower life expectancy. They will prioritize less in education, therefore making people more vulnerable to poverty and ignorance, and it goes downhill from there.

So, I'm not saying that people cannot survive without vaccines. 90% of people probably can. But vaccines have a snowball effect on making our lives better.

I still believe in my body my choice. If the united nations want to force everyone to take the coronavirus vaccine, I will oppose it, because my body my choice. No government has the right to inject me, a non-consenting adult, with any forced injection because:

1. Like you said, survival isn't 0%. The survival of the coronavirus is actually 99%. Also, the vaccine isn't 100% effective.

There are patients in beds in the hallways toe to head, vertical hold is full, the waiting rooms are full and there’s no rooms for patients to be admitted to in order to clear the ER.

A few years ago when there was a bad flu year we were transporting patients in acute respiratory distress whom the hospitals had previously had in patient and whom they’d discharged to make room for others. 

I’m totally floored seeing the response and disdain about concern from our government officials, Especially given the way this strain of Coronavirus is behaving, the immense unknowns re transmission capabilities, amount of time it survives on surfaces, the possibility of asymptomatic transmission and the clear and documented lack of accurate information from Chinese officials.

We might not have anything to be concerned about as far as an epidemic in the US, but our system is already at max capacity. An ounce of prevention and some science based caution seems far more than wise. I just don’t get the “meh” I’m seeing from the WHO and CDC."

The post claimed it was a case of coronavirus, and a screenshot of an email from the Lorenzo’s manager, Chance Kidd, seemed to confirm that.

The news that the first reputed coronavirus case in the center of Los Angeles had been detected near USC immediately went viral. A lot of people tweeted panicked, performative posts about hand-washing and the threat of disease. One poster claimed a friend’s roommate’s brother’s girlfriend had been infected.

The last 24 hours has seen a decline of new cases versus the previous three days. The novel coronavirus outbreak seems to have stalled out in China.


The Johns Hopkins University tracking system shows a leveling off of new case loads, and they are now on par with where they were a week ago following big jumps since last Thursday.

In addition, China’s National Health Commission (NHC) predicted on Tuesday that the mortality rate would start to taper off in the days ahead. Meanwhile, the World Health Organization said early this morning that the viral outbreak has not reached a rate for them to consider this a global pandemic.

I’ve known that the IPCC underpredicted the rate of climate change for decades, and even just recently scientists have found that the same climate models the world has been using to frame policy are showing much higher and far scarier rates of warming—up to 5 degrees Celsius.  
The world has already past 9 important tipping points.  Water scarcity is getting worse.  Agriculture has been taking a hit.  The Arctic’s sea ice is melting fast, and it’s a train that we won’t be able to turn around.  When it melts away entirely (likely very soon) there’ll be nothing to stop global warming from ravaging unhinged across the earth.  Combine that with a likely shut down of air travel from the coronavirus or any other pandemic the world is inadequately prepared to deal with without a dramatic slowdown of economic activity, and then the aerosols in the air fall away and allow temperatures to soar rapidly as well.  It’ll be a nightmare for humans.

The reason that the ""Spanish flu"" in 1918 killed so many is that it didn't just kill the elderly and children. It was a strain of influenza that was particularly harsh for young, healthy adults. 

There is no perfect vaccine against influenza. It's a rapidly mutating virus. The seasonal vaccine is comprised of a mix of strains that doctors believe will be present during the flu season. 

There isn't herd immunity when we have an emerging strain of influenza. The vaccines only protect against the strains that have been selected that year, which are a fraction of the strains known.

Elderberry extract in the body has been shown to help block the viruses from being able to enter cells. They then also can't replicate in the cells as well. So there's multiple parts of the viral life cycle that get inhibited. That's much more effective than if it only helped with a single part, because it makes it much harder for the virus to infect a cell and if it does, it doesn't reproduce as much, and the other cells still have enhanced resistance to infection. So it works synergistically to reduce viral loads. It's why for things like HIV drugs, they'll do a cocktail of antiretrovirals, because they attack different weaknesses in the virus at different points in the life cycle so it needs pass multiple hurdles to be able to infect other cells. 

In studies in the lab, it's been shown that elderberry syrup had antimicrobial properties - it's been shown that it kills bacteria and viruses outside of the body.

The study with the air travel, they gave elderberry from 10 days in advance for prophylaxis (preventing getting infected), it's also been shown to reduce the time you are sick if you take it when you get infected.

It's worth noting if you're going to use it, it's way cheaper to buy dried elderberry and brew it yourself, the syrup is very expensive. It's also super bitter, so add honey (also antimicrobial) generously. We use it before international flights along with garlic.

Garlic also has antimicrobial properties and works as an immunomodulator, meaning it changes how the immune system works. It works by boosting white blood cells, and making them effective. (Specifically, stimulating lymphocyte production, NK cells, and increasing macrophage cytotoxicity).

Protip: Elderberry is part of our nCoV2019 (coronavirus) strategy if there's an outbreak here. It seems like it will probably help with that based on its effectiveness against other coronaviruses."

> SINGAPORE: A patient who was infected with the novel coronavirus has recovered and was discharged from the National Centre for Infectious Diseases (NCID), the Ministry of Health (MOH) said on Tuesday (Feb 4).

> The patient, a 35-year-old man from Wuhan who was Singapore's seventh confirmed case, has been ""comprehensively tested negative"" for the virus, the ministry added.

> 

> Advertisement

> ""We discharged one patient today ... all his symptoms had fully resolved and he's had consecutive tests over three days where the tests were all negative,"" MOH's director of medical services Kenneth Mak said at a press conference.

> 

> ""We are quite confident that, in fact, he has no longer got any infection there.""

> The man had tested positive for the coronavirus on Jan 27. He had arrived in Singapore on Jan 23 and went to Raffles Hospital after he developed symptoms on Jan 24. He was then transferred to NCID by private ambulance.

> 

> Doctors are continuing to watch the infected patients closely, Assoc Prof Mak said, adding that another patient is being prepared for the ""possibility of discharge over the next few days"".

> 

> Advertisement

> ""We cannot commit just yet, because it is a decision that the doctors (will have to) make as they review the patient on a day-to-day basis. And therefore it would be premature for me to say that he would definitely be discharged,"" he said.

> 

> PATIENTS WELL, NONE IN ICU

> There are a ""number of patients"" who are well, Assoc Prof Mak said, noting that at least three patients have no symptoms.

> 

> Five of the patients have been given ""some oxygen"" to support their breathing, he said, adding that this is ""not surprising in view of the fact that they had pneumonia"".

> ""This is basically to support them,"" he said. ""None of them are in the ICU (Intensive Care Unit), none of them are critically ill at this point in time.""

> 

> On Tuesday, MOH announced Singapore's first locally transmitted cases among six new cases of the novel coronavirus, bringing the total to 24.

> 

> Four people with no recent travel history to China have tested positive for the coronavirus, MOH said. The other two cases are Singapore residents who had been evacuated from Wuhan on Jan 30.

> 

> As of noon on Tuesday, 289 suspect cases have tested negative for the novel coronavirus, MOH said. Test results for the remaining 20 cases are pending.

> 

> Contact tracing for the confirmed cases is ongoing. As of noon on Tuesday, MOH has identified 311 close contacts. Of the 239 who are still in Singapore, 234 have been contacted and are being quarantined or isolated.

> 

> ""Efforts are ongoing to contact the remaining five close contacts,"" the ministry added.

> 

> Singapore on Saturday widened travel restrictions to stop all new visitors of any nationality with recent travel history to mainland China from entering Singapore. These visitors are also not allowed to transit in Singapore.

> The coronavirus has killed more than 420 people and infected more than 20,000 around the world. The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared the virus outbreak a global emergency.

In HIV the antivirals suppress much of the virus to the point where it only survives in a small number of cells and can't really reproduce all that much making it undetectable and transmittable.  But in HIV the virus still does in fact survive.  The last I heard the theory is there are some cells that act as deep 'reservoirs' for the virus where the antiviral does not get to. I haven't read up on recently to see if that is refined at all, it wouldn't surprise me if research has gone beyond what I read a few years ago.   Regardless the immune system never fully 'cleans' it up and remains susceptible to it so if you stop the antivirals or the virus does still manage to mutate despite the antivirals it will flair back up.

The cornavirus as far as we know if it doesn't kill you the immune system will successfully attack it given enough time to adapt.  So giving antivirals assuming they do work on coronavirus I would expect it to drastically decrease the viral load reducing their symptoms and give the patient's own immune system a chance to successfully negate the remainder of it.

I'm not an expert on HIV, antivirals or viruses though I do know a fair amount of immunology from my job and took biology in college. Hopefully someone who is comes along and gives a more detailed answer."

Answer: Hello!

The use of fetal tissue in vaccine development is the practice of researching, developing, and producing vaccines through the use of cultured (laboratory-grown) human fetal cells. The vaccines themselves contain none of the original cells and very slight traces of human DNA.Most vaccines currently available were developed using cell strains cultured from two fetuses aborted for other purposes in the 1960s. This has led some to oppose vaccination on religious or moral grounds. However, vaccine experts and manufacturers state that vaccines do not contain any of the original fetal tissue or cells, that the abortions occurred decades ago and replenishment with new tissue has not occurred.

I won't claim to be an expert or even intermediate on this subject since my networking knowledge is trash and I seldom go back to mainland. I almost never need to bypass GFW and put my setup to proper testing, especially during ""sensitive time"" such as June 4th (where nothing happened in Tienanmen Square), Oct 1st (~~national~~ ccp day), and even the recent coronavirus shitstorm. These are the time when the GFW engine start pumping and most of the usual method fail.

Most of the time people outside of China will simply say ""VPN"" or whatever, but common VPN protocol like OpenVPN can be easily identified and can be either outright blocked or drop packet. SOCKS5 is not an option as well for the same reason.

TOR without bridge is completely useless in mainland. Even with bridge, it is mostly a cat and mouse game since the ccp can just keep blocking bridges if they ~~find~~ suspect one. Add that on top of the 3 layer of onion routing and you can already see it is pretty unusable on daily basis. TOR is normally reserved for aforementioned sensitive times and you are also doing very lightweight browsing. Have fun traversing the modern web with TOR when even 4 GB of ram is considered bare minimum requirement due to the stupendous amount of script.

I2P seems to be on the same boat as TOR, although I am not familiar with it so I cannot say for certain

I've heard story of my friend using SSH tunnelling but that was ages ago. It also seems to be rather annoying to setup so I didn't bother trying.

The most commonly used bypass technologies nowadays are [Shadowsocks](https://shadowsocks.org/en/index.html), [V2Ray](https://www.v2ray.com/en/index.html), [Wireguard](https://www.wireguard.com/), [Trojan](https://trojan-gfw.github.io/trojan/). Some old players include [Freegate](http://dit-inc.us/freegate.html), [Psiphon](https://psiphon.ca/), [Lantern](https://github.com/getlantern).

If you are really tech illiterate, you can even buy from some ""questionable"" service providers that provide out-of-the-box configuration and all you need to do is simply login. (questionable both from the ccp's perspective as in this is illegal, and from our perspective since 10 times out of 10 those are honeypot)

None of the tech above is 100% reliable. All of which require certain amount of technical knowledge to set up yourself and even more paranoid mindset and technical skill to prevent you from being traced back. And depends on where you live (especially Xinjiang, and now Wuhan), all these techs above might not even work at all due to much stricter enforcement of GFW. Also, literally cutting you off from the outside world is always an option.

Yeah, these are pretty much the hoops mainlanders have to jump through just to have a breath of fresh air."

This virus has a 96% similarity to a coronavirus found in **bats.** While most research has pointed towards bats, research at Peking University **implicated snakes as the most likely 'reservoir'** of the rapidly spreading virus. 

The progenitor virus itself was almost certainly one that circulates harmlessly in bats (as SARS does) but has an “intermediate reservoir” in one or more animals that come into contact with people. Presumably, that reservoir is one of the species of animals at the Wuhan market thought to be ground zero for the outbreak. The ancestor of 2019-nCoV existed in that species for some unknown time, never infecting people, until by chance a single virus acquired a mutation that made it capable of jumping into and infecting humans. **The genome sequences suggest that was a one-time-only jump.** “The genomes \[from the 24 samples\] are very uniform”. “If there had been multiple introductions,” including from many different animals, “there would be more genomic diversity. This was a single introduction.” ([Link](https://www.statnews.com/2020/01/24/dna-sleuths-read-coronavirus-genome-tracing-origins-and-mutations/))"

Hours later, officials from the health department summoned the doctor and sanctioned him for sharing information. He was then compelled to sign a statement of secrecy and told his warning constituted “illegal behavior,” according to the Times’ reconstruction of the seven weeks between the first occurrence of the virus and the government’s decision to lock down the city of Wuhan. “In those weeks, the authorities silenced doctors and others for raising red flags,” the Times reports. “They played down the dangers to the public, leaving the city’s 11 million residents unaware they should protect themselves.”*"

However a lot of these meat markets in China have very bad health standards so often times these viruses make their way from the animal (like a small bat) to the person. Then sometimes the virus is able to mutate to pass from person to person and have a effect on people. 

The reason it isn't as bad here is cause they either eat animals that very rarely carry dangerous viruses and ones that can potentially spread to humans and have better health standards.

This whole system was the exact reason SARS started back in 2002 and why the meat markets in china really need to either be stopped or controlled much better cause a lot of them are taking animals and stuff from the streets."

The month before, then-White House National Security Advisor John Bolton pressured Ziemer’s DHS counterpart, Tom Bossert, to resign along with his team. Neither the NSC nor DHS epidemic teams have been replaced. The global health section of the CDC was so drastically cut in 2018 that much of its staff was laid off and the number of countries it was working in was reduced from 49 to merely 10. Meanwhile, throughout 2018, the U.S. Agency for International Development and its director, Mark Green, came repeatedly under fire from both the White House and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo.

WHAT CAUSES THE COMMON COLD?

The common cold is a contagious viral infection caused by roughly 200 different strains of virus. Around 50% of the time, the common cold is caused by the rhinovirus, but other cold-causing viruses include influenza, coronavirus, and adenovirus.

When these viruses enter the body, they attack the mucous membranes of the nose, throat, and mouth. After a few days, the virus might also make its way to the lungs. The body’s immune system will fight the virus in all of these areas, causing inflammation and an overproduction of mucus, which carries dead, infected cells and expels them from the body. This is what ultimately causes the telltale symptoms of a cold, like a runny nose and nasal congestion, a sore throat, coughing and sneezing, and (in case of the flu) fever.

How Cannabis Can Fight the Flu

CANNABINOIDS AND TERPENES CAN FIGHT INFLAMMATION

If you’re reading this, you may already be familiar with the anti-inflammatory effects of cannabis. Research shows that cannabinoids like THC, CBD, CBG, and CBC can all help drive down inflammation all around the body. Some of the terpenes in cannabis, including linalool, limonene, and eucalyptol, all have anti-inflammatory potential too.

Our body’s attempt to fight cold and flu viruses automatically causes inflammation in the throat, sinuses, nose, and lungs. The cannabinoids and terpenes found in cannabis may help drive down inflammation in these areas, and therefore relieve symptoms like a runny or congested nose.

RELATED STORY
Cannabis Can Help Regulate Inflammation
CANNABIS AFFECTS THE IMMUNE SYSTEM

Current research has made it clear that cannabis affects the human immune system. How it does so, however, isn’t 100% clear.

Some studies show that cannabinoids help suppress the immune system, which is what ultimately gives them their anti-inflammatory effect. This is good news for people suffering from conditions characterised by chronic inflammation. However, it’s also important to remember that acute inflammation is a necessary bodily process and a sign that our immune system is actively fighting a threat in our body (like a virus, for example).

However, other studies show that cannabis can boost the immune system when necessary. HIV/AIDS, for example, is underlined by immunodeficiency that gets worse over time. Research indicates that cannabis can help strengthen the immune system of people with HIV/AIDS by increasing their number of T cells. This suggests that cannabis may be able to help strengthen the immune system when needed, such as when fighting an immediate threat like a cold virus."

Where flu strains vary year to year to some degree but most of it has been around the block before in one form or another. 

This particular bug (it remains to be seen) may have been engineered and escaped containment at a level 4 biolab that's literally 20 miles away from the alleged seafood market that was closed but that's a whole nother theory.

Up to 2 week incubation period which means we all failed in screening people going out from CHina and 5 million people fled Wuhan when CHina started to close the doors around them.

In simple English: They let the cat out of the bag. Way out.

Approx 3 million CHinese visit US every year - or about 8k a day. IN the time it took CHina to close all the doors, approx 200k Chinese are in the USA (this is a guess based on 3MM a year divided by 365 days)

If even a couple dozen of those 200k are sick and walking around LA, SF, NY, DC Boston, etc  we may see what happened there happen here. 

And what happened in CHina?  I'll show you. 

BELOW is the patient track from Johns Hopkins tracking. This thing exploded at 10x growth per week and in little over a month they have 20k cases and over 400 dead. 

If this continues to grow at even a 5x rate per week for the next 3 weeks it looks like this:

25k / 250k / 1.5 MM / CASES

If you figure 3-5% mortality thats 45k - 75k Dead.

Now take it out another 8-12 weeks and you could have many many millions sick worldwide and  who even knows? dead. 

[JOHNS HOPKINS CASE DBASE](https://gisanddata.maps.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html#/bda7594740fd40299423467b48e9ecf6)

1/15/2020 Total Cases 47 Dead 1

DAY SIX: 2/3/2020 Total Cases 20,613 Dead 427

DAY SEVEN 2/4/2020 Total Cases TBD Dead TBD

Where it gets scary is the widespread belief CHina has not been completely honest with us about actual case and death counts. MOst math models say that the actual number of cases ranges from 4x to 8x what is being reported. 

Wuhan has essentially fallen into the 7th layer of hell and basic services are breaking down - you may not get a clear count until May/June when the SAR teams go door to door and remove the dead.

In normal days before this outbreak, this system has implications on healthcare, education and hence social mobility -- e.g. if you come from the rural villages and move to Beijing to work, you will not be eligible for state sponsored education for your children in Beijing since you lack a Beijing hukou and ur child can only go to school in the correct province that their hukou is from. 

While this system certainly breeds resentment/animositt (due to the social stratification it causes), I don't believe current animosity towards people from Hubei stems from that. The fear of anyone from Hubei is probably due to concerns that they carry the Coronavirus. However, the Hukou system makes it easy to trace the origins of a person (think: American driving license that is issued by individual states) which is why the case above is occuring against those with Hubei origins."

For confirmed cases, the number is capped due to limited supply of Coronavirus testing kits. Patients with virus symptoms can only be categorized as suspicious cases before they can be tested by the testing kit. Overflowing hospital with limited medical personnel can be another limiting factor.

Furthermore, many people can die before they get a chance to be diagnosed. The deaths will not be included in the number of death due to coronavirus.

The Chinese government did lie when SARS broken out in 2003 because they wanted to prevent mass panic and discontent against the government. That decision led to massive backlashes. I think they learnt their lesson and you can see big differences between how they handle and report the current epidemic and what they did 17 years ago."

2020-02-04,Gayfetus,boxoffice,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/boxoffice/comments/eyj2se/with_cinemas_possible_not_opening_back_up_until/fghvwbh/,"There have already been [a slew of domestic tent poles](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/enter-fat-dragon-cancels-china-release-moves-streaming-coronavirus-epidemic-1275268) that have been pulled from theaters as a result of the virus. And that's during the peak cinema-going period in China! So I'd say movies like ""Lost in Russia"" and ""Enter the Fat Dragon"" are the most affected.

As for Hollywood releases, we can look at films from franchises that traditionally have a considerable percentage of grosses from the Middle Kingdom: F9 (as others have mentioned), Minions, Black Widow are some of them, Mulan isn't from a franchise per se, but it's clearly aimed at the Chinese market, so that's another one that takes a hit.

It's not a perfect comparison, but ""Detective Pikachu"" made 93 million of its 431 million WW take in China. So ""Sonic the Hedgehog"" might lose out on a chunk of Yuan as well.

Pixar films have traditionally under-performed in China compared to other territories. Except... ""Coco"" became an unexpected runaway hit there. It's hard to say if ""Onward"", the upcoming Pixar caper, would find similar success. ""Coco"" connected in China because of its ancestor theme, it's possible that ""Onward""'s dead dad plot would resonate, too. If so, it could make a hefty difference for ""Onward""'s ultimate WW take, but we may never know! On the other hand, Pixar's ""Soul"" is probably too high concept to play well as an animated feature in China, where people expect cartoons to be aimed primarily at kids, and seem to reject anything that tries to do more (thus Pixar's many flops in China).

They love The Rock in China. So if the viral crisis is still ongoing when ""Jungle Cruise"" comes out, that's another one that could hurt. Doubly so because Disney is undoubtedly counting on the movie to help promote its Hong Kong and Shanghai Disney parks.

Paul W.S. Anderson's last theatrical release, ""Resident Evil: Final Chapter"", made more than half of its 312 million WW gross in China (by contrast, that film only made 26 mil in the US). So his upcoming ""Monster Hunter"" adaptation could take quite the hit if theaters are still down. But one would seriously hope and expect that things have improved by September, which is when that movie is coming out."

-Shopping agents working from home from the 3rd (with limited ability to work I’d imagine). 
-Order processing should be delayed 1-2 days, 
-And they’re opening the warehouse on the 10th. 


(I don’t know how to format nicely so here’s the full email below)

Dear Superbuy users:

Due to the need of prevention and control of the coronavirus outbreak, the Chinese government stipulates that enterprises cannot resume work earlier than 10 Feb.(no earlier than 13 Feb. in Wuhan), therefore our Spring Festival Holiday will be extended to [9 Feb., 2020] (Beijing Time), . The resuming time of our services is as follows (subject to further update):

Order Processing: In consideration of users’ demand, our shopping agents will start to work at home from 9:00 on 3 Feb., but due to difficulties such as office being in remote areas, poor equipment and internet connection, etc., the purchasing timeliness will be affected (expected to be delayed by 1-2 days). The shopping agents will process all orders in turn according to the time of order submission, and priority will be given to orders with Speedy Response without additional charge. Service fee already charged for Speedy Response will be refunded to your account. Due to the delayed resumption of business for sellers of e-commerce platforms including Taobao and JD.com, the purchase and domestic delivery will be greatly affected. Thank you for your understanding and please wait patiently! For shipping timeliness, please see The Updated Adjustment of Shipping and Transaction Process of Taobao during the Spring Festival in 2020 (in Chinese).

Customer Service: it will be resumed from 9:00 on 5 Feb., and enquiries will be processed in turn by customer service staff via remote operation. The working hour will be 9:00-18:00 instead of 24 hours (subject to further update);

Warehousing and Logistics: they will be resumed from 9:00 on 10 Feb.

Likewise there was no information about when this occurred or where. The body of the post was literally just the video without context.


So I went and looked a bit, finding [this tweet](https://twitter.com/ASBreakingNews/status/1224378532706603010) on [another sub](https://www.reddit.com/r/China/comments/eyk33d/chinese_authorities_pressuring_citizen_to_delete/). I'm not sure on the credibility of this Twitter account, however it suggests that this it's *""presumably before the outbreak happened on large scale.""* This throws into doubt the timeline of this posts title which suggests it's a current event.


Looking at that other post, [the OP of that post himself mentions](https://www.reddit.com/r/China/comments/eyk33d/chinese_authorities_pressuring_citizen_to_delete/fgiaeek/) that the video references ""疫情"" which they say to mean *""Epidemic Information""*. However in the video itself the English subtitles are *""Coronavirus Outbreak""*. Unless I've misunderstood, it seems that there is contention on the translation & that it may just be assumed the Coronavirus Outbreak.


The OP of this post hasn't sought to provide any context that challenges the context provided elsewhere, so now the time, location & subject could be unknown. Coupled with not knowing what the post made by the citizen was the whole video has barely any credible ground to stand on until proven otherwise. This isn't the first time OP has shared these types of videos with loaded titles, so excuse me if I don't like to take these videos at face value. I'm sick of the anti-China circle-jerk here, that's not what this place is meant to be. Yeah, I dislike the Chinese government too but it's frustrating that so many here wish to use this outbreak as a means to push their anti-China agenda. Leave the assumptions at the door, this sub is supposed to be about the analysis & discussion of credible information."

If you can only run a few thousand tests a day, that is how fast the confirmed cases can be rising as the sickest people tend to be tested first. We can only guess at the actual number of infected.

Ars technica has a nice [write up](https://arstechnica.com/science/2020/02/how-does-one-test-for-coronavirus-anyway/) of what is involved in testing the samples

>... To make a diagnostic test specific to 2019-nCoV, researchers had to look for areas of its genome that don't change rapidly over coronavirus evolution but have changed enough in this branch of the family that they can be viewed as its distinctive signature. Those sequences can be used to design a means of amplifying a piece of the 2019-nCoV genome using a technique called the polymerase chain reaction, or PCR.   
>  
>We won't go into all of the technical details of how PCR works, in part because [we've already done so](https://arstechnica.com/science/2009/11/dna-sequencing-part-2-ligases-and-pcr/). For the purposes of understanding the diagnostic test, all you have to know is that you need to design two small pieces of DNA that match (meaning they can base pair with) two sections of the genome a few hundred base pairs apart. These small pieces of DNA are called ""primers."" PCR will amplify the section of DNA between the two primers. ...  
>  
>... If the right sequence for the primers is present—meaning 2019-nCoV is present in the sample—amplification will typically start with the very first cycle and grow rapidly. Errors, in contrast, may take a few cycles to occur and amplification therefore lags for a bit. To figure out when 2019-nCoV is really present, we have to identify when the amplification happens quickly and when it lags. We have to observe the progress of the PCR cycles in real time.  
>  
>To do so, scientists developed a dye that only fluoresces if double-stranded DNA is present....

There are even few more steps to complicate things even further."

> SINGAPORE - The Singapore Airshow will go ahead as planned next week despite the withdrawal of 16 exhibitors and fewer visitors expected as travel disruption grows from the spiralling coronavirus outbreak.

> Experia Events, the airshow's organiser, said the biennial event will proceed as planned from Feb 11 to 16 with enhanced precautionary measures ""to safeguard the well-being and safety of all attendees"" in view of the evolving coronavirus situation.

> This includes additional temperature screening at access points at Singapore Expo and Changi Exhibition Centre, as well as provision of hand sanitisers and a team of doctors and medics to attend to visitors who are feeling unwell, it said in a statement on Tuesday (Feb 4).

> Mr Leck Chet Lam, managing director of Experia Events said: “The health and well-being of our attendees is of the utmost priority. Alongside these additional measures, we will also continue to take reference from guidelines provided by the authorities such as Singapore’s Ministry of Health.”

> The firm confirmed on Tuesday the cancellation of a key aviation conference, involving 300 government officials, civil aviation authorities, airport operators and airline executives.

> ""This will allow many of the aviation leaders who are deeply involved in working out the responses to the novel coronavirus outbreak to focus on exigencies related to the ongoing situation,"" it said.

> Of the 16 exhibitors who have pulled out, 10 are from China and six from four other countries, including aerospace companies Gulfstream, Textron Aviation and Bombardier .

> Experia Events said Singapore’s recent travel restrictions in response to the virus outbreak and company policies on employee travel bans during this period is also expected to reduce the number of visitors.

> Ten of the companies which have exited are Chinese, while six are from other countries. They include Canadian aerospace firm Bombardier, as well as US-based business jet manufacturers Gulfstream and Textron Aviation.

> South Korean air force’s aerobatic team, the Black Eagles also confirmed its withdrawal from this year’s airshow.

> Related Story Coronavirus: Get latest updates

> Related Story Interactive: Places impacted by the coronavirus so far

> Independent aviation analyst Brendan Sobie noted that it is a ""very fluid situation"", with large aviation companies like Airbus and Lockheed still expected to attend but with a reduced presence.

> Experia said it remains ""ready and prepared to implement further enhanced measures as required by the authorities"", and that it will be providing further updates leading up to the airshow.

> There were more than 20,600 confirmed cases of the coronavirus as of Tuesday, with more than 420 deaths. The World Health Organization has declared the crisis a global health emergency.

While the flu is underestimated, the new Coronavirus could cause a lot more harm than flu has caused in the last 100 years. Comparing it to the flu is not putting the level of attention of the flu on a reasonable level, but underestimating the threat represented by the Coronavirus. Albeit that some countries have a better health system than 100 years ago, many countries still have poor health systems and we have a lot more elderly people out there. Imagine this in Japan (old population), or in Africa and Latin America (poor health systems). This could overwhelm Healthcare systems easily if it spread out of China, it's more spreadable than the flu and it kills according to estimates, a several times higher proportion of those who get it. If it really spread, like the flu, even the health care systems in rich countries would fail and that's what the fuss is all about.

""It's just the flu"" is bullshit

I you know the structure of the lung, you know they are like trees. Your trachea branches off into smaller tubes which branch off into smaller tunes which end in alveoli where oxygen is absorbed

Flu causes pneumonia. It makes alveoli in one node of your lung fill with fluid. It also inflames it so it is incapable of drawing in air

Coronavirus causes this to happen to *both of your entire lungs*

Saying it is the same is the flu is like saying a paper cut is the same as slashing your femoral arterty

When they do, you better be in the ER with your insurance card out because it moves fast

This new guidance from the UK may reflect the possibility that the quarantine will either continue to expand until it reaches the nation's borders, or that the quarantine is likely to remain in effect for an uncomfortably long time with concomitant restrictions on civil liberties and difficulty accessing aid from embassies etc. Supply lines and basic necessities are [already threatened](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/04/business/china-coronavirus-food-prices.html), and even very lucrative businesses [are suspended](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/04/business/coronavirus-macau-gambling.html). The intensity of the instructions from the Chinese government has significantly increased and the language seems to set the scene for extreme action:

>Mr. Xi warned officials not to resist orders or to let ""bureaucratism"" slow government efforts to bring the outbreak under control. ""Those who disobey the unified command or shirk off responsibilities will be punished,"" Mr. Xi said, the Xinhua news agency reported."

I completely see your point, and of course I think it’s ridiculous that they wouldn’t even consider her specific circumstance. 

I’m just saying that from their perspective the virus is insanely transmissible. It is not like the regular flu which each infected person transmits to just one other person. Each coronavirus is passed on to 4 other people. The difference is that with 1 the number never increases, it maintains at 1. At 4 the number grows exponentially and within a month you have thousands of sick people from just one visitor.

A Briton quarantined onboard a cruise ship in Japan amid coronavirus fears, said the ship resembles a “ghost town”.

David Abel, who is onboard the Diamond Princess with his wife Sally, is one of 3,000 passengers being screened at the port of Yokohama after a tourist from Hong Kong tested positive for coronavirus.

Mr Abel was due to fly home to the UK on Monday but had to cancel their flight after they were not allowed to leave.

The couple, from Woodford Halse in Oxfordshire, now have an open return, as they do not know when the quarantine will be lifted.

“We didn’t get much sleep last night, as we were waiting for that knock on the door to be checked,” he said.

Whereas China is a hybrid Communist/Capitalist shit hole with Orwellian surveillance, Orwellian social credit, and the Chinese are basically a singular Hive mind like Ants, there is very little difference from one person to the next. Luckily some of the Chinese that are here, have broken the Chinese conditioning and become much more looser and happier to be free

LMFAO!!!!!!!!!!! Those camps for the millions of Muslims sure are spectacular!

>You might want to contrast Toronto's status with the fate that's befallen Buffalo, Detroit and Chicago 

I actually agree with here but this is more so a problem because of Democrats who are some of the most retarded people in the world. Liberalism is causing a self implosion, its the same liberalism that allowed you fools to colonize Toronto and price out the locals. Liberalism basically allows a Hive Mind like China to come and destroy it.

>that either have or else are in the process of falling into wrack and ruin despite the similarity in their origins but not in their attitudes about what it takes to actually maintain a sane, heathy, and well adjusted modern society and city and keep it that way.

I actually agree with you here. I would rather live in Toronto with the Chinese than in any of those Liberal cities of decay. 

>You can scoff all you like but it doesn't change that by one iota, it merely demonstrates just how ignorant you really are 

Actually I'm not ignorant at all. I understand geopolitics and I also am very interested in how you guys will manage the African and Australian Colonization takeover. I also predict there will be a future war between Islam and China and I would side with you guys in that war in a heart beat. But you guys are still horrible in a lot of ways with your spying and theft.

>and contribute to it being that very way in those as well as countless other US cities.

My ideology, being strict on crime and fixing the cities the way Giuliani did in New York and being an Independent Libertarian is a minority view, and because of that, I have very little say and hardly any contribution to have its all imploding

>You won't find anything like that anywhere in Canada.

Yeah you do, crime is increasing in many cities like Toronto, the country is importing Muslims and 3rd worlders, Trudeau is such a spineless bitch he would rather let sick Chinese fly in endlessly instead of closing down all flights and doing a quarantine on Chinese and that spinelessness is part of Canada's problem.

In fact, I can verify my claim to brighten your cynical day: Meet [Elijah Daniel](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/D2y_2auU8AAUsoM?format=jpg&name=medium), a gay comedian/rapper (rapper alias ""Lil Phaggot"") known for ironic jokes and for public trolling, e.g. for [his Amazon best-selling erotic Trump fanfic](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Trump-Temptations-Billionaire-Elijah-Daniel-ebook/dp/B01AX111Q2) and for renaming Hell, Michigan ""Gay Hell"" and for [outlawing heterosexuality](https://i0.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/elijah-daniel-2-d69c.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&zoom=1&resize=540%2C534&ssl=1).

This tweet [\(and it really is his tweet\)](https://pics.me.me/elijah-daniele-elijahdaniel-depression-tip-if-ur-feeling-sador-eggs-46752025.png) is right up his alley of ironic takes on mental health, sexuality, that sort of stuff.

Also, hate to break it to you, but from the three last corona viruses that have caused panic for killed people, this is by far the weakest.

The original reply to OC was what should happen to the guy if OC's story was true.

You're literally getting worked up over hypotheticals. Not a single person has stated anything as fact.

And in this specific hypothetical, if it were to be true, the guy is absolutely attempting murder by spitting in the face of a doctor while sick with coronavirus.

In conclusion, i give your reading comprehension a 3/10."
2020-02-04,chodapp,freemasonry,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/freemasonry/comments/ey296x/grand_lodge/fgjgsrr/,"Lance has given you excellent advice. It's interesting that you say you want to wait until 30 – the average joining age for Freemasons since about 1930 when they started paying attention to this stuff has almost uniformly been 39-50. I joined at 40, and I honestly don't believe I was mature enough before that, even if becoming a Mason had occurred to me earlier in life.

Fast track, one-day events? Avoid them like the coronavirus. And not just because it's like slurping from a burst fireplug. Freemasonry always was and always will be about building close, personal relationships with the men in your lodge, while the wider fraternity is designed to shortcut the issue of dealing with total strangers by giving us all common ground where none might otherwise exist. Almost everyone who went through a one-day event (myself included) will advise you not to do it, even though a one-day Mason is every bit as likely to be active and participate as guys who go through traditionally. The issue is what you miss. You miss the time needed to contemplate the words and lessons of the degrees. You miss the lifelong bonding of a mentor relationship that was deliberately designed into the degree system. You miss learning and understanding the common language of the degrees that extend worldwide, despite the many variations that exist. You miss the slow ramp-up in meeting and getting to know individual lodge brothers as true friends you'd trust quite literally with your life, and then expanding fraternity wide. You miss life skills no one ever taught you before because you never encountered so many men who differ from you on every level. Etc, etc.

As for the Scottish Rite, as Lance alluded, it sounds like you have a misconception of what it is. This is basic stuff, but it's no lie that the Master Mason degree is the most important degree you can have conferred, and the other 29 degrees of the Scottish Rite (or all of the related degrees and orders of the York Rite) must be considered as continuing education, NOT more important.  I absolutely counsel waiting several years before joining the SR and experiencing its numerous degrees. In fact, you may never see any reason to join it. Or as you research it, the York Rite may appeal to you more deeply (as it CAN be experienced one-on-one in a lodge-like setting, and not a massive auditorium event of the SR). Or you might decide the lodge and its three Craft degrees are enough. Or you may want to join EVERYTHING, which is fine, too. But seeing degrees once through and never again is a VERY different situation than repeated viewings, active participation in their conferrals, private or group contemplative study, and more. Experienced Masons will repeat it to you again and again - do it the slow way.

Let me put it another way - if, as you say, you ""want [your] name to mean something in Freemasonry"" with admiring men ""proud to call you Brother,"" you achieve that by regular participation in the groups you belong to as an officer, cast member, regular and enthusiastic sideliner, volunteer worker, helping hand, attentive and sympathetic ear, or even dispensing sage wisdom in time. You DON""T achieve that by joining everything, volunteering for everything, stretching yourself to the limit, and quickly burning out because your enthusiasm ran out of steam. We've all seen it, and many of us have done it ourselves. 

You've got a lifetime to experience all that Freemasonry has to offer (and the list is absolutely endless). Concentrate on being a Mason, brother, friend and improving your own habits first. The rest will take care of itself."

Stop. You have no evidence for this, just speculation designed to hurt democrats.

This. If anyone wants to know what the Russians want just go to rt (dot) com and see what narratives they're pushing. Not saying you can't necessarily happen to agree with any of the views they push, but just know that their disinformation machine is very strong so always take that into consideration with what you read online.

For instance, I'm a Bernie supporter but you'll see a lot of positive coverage on RT for Bernie both now and in the 2016 primary. The reason is because the Russians wanted to help sew discord within in the democratic party to ultimately help elect Trump, and they knew that amplifying the narrative that Bernie was got shafted by the DNC was a great way to do that. While it's true that the DNC doesn't exactly love Bernie with him being an independent in the past, they try to amplify this to the extreme to cause chaos and discord.

We ultimately need to unite and never lose sight of the ultimate goal of removing Trump from office.

Just as a sidepoint, here's a basic summary of the frontpage of RT right now:

* Iowa Democrats incompetent.
* Iowa caucus app linked to Clinton and Buttigieg.
* Greta Thunberg bad.
* Brexit good.
* Macron bad.
* Neolibs literally satan.
* Coronavirus scary.
* Hollywood is a bunch of triggered libs.
* China Bad."

Then explain? Calling it stupid does not make it so. Death/recovery is often used as a means of projecting the true case fatality rate - flu has a ''recovery rate'' of around 99%. Likewise, I'd assume that implying that the 20,000 people infected right now are all going to survive is also rather 'stupid'. The current mortality rate circulating about assumes 1. all of the 20,000 infected now will survive and 2. that the virus kills you instantly, which it does not.

Right now the coronavirus has a very low recovery rate relative to the death rate. That is concerning no matter how you try to spin it and dance around it."

TOKYO, Feb 5 (Reuters) - Japan’s military prepared a chartered ferry on Wednesday to use as a quarantine ship that could house hundreds of suspected coronavirus cases as the number of infected people in the country rises.
The 17,000 ton Hakuo was docked at the Yokosuka naval base near Tokyo, which is also the home port of the U.S. Navy’s Ronald Reagan carrier. If put into service, the ship will initially take up to 94 people, but can accommodate more.
“Around 300 people could comfortably live on the ship and it has a maximum capacity for 500, although that would mean queues for the baths and other facilities,” a Japan Self Defense Force official told Reuters.

Preparations aboard the Hakuo come as health authorities placed more than 3,500 people on two weeks quarantine on a cruise liner anchored off Japan after health officials confirmed that 10 people on the ship had tested positive for coronavirus and more cases were possible.

Japan’s government has come in for criticism that it has been too slow to respond to the health crisis. Unlike other countries, Japan has not yet forcibly quarantined people who may carry the coronavirus, including Japanese returning on evacuation flights from Wuhan in central China where the epidemic began.

Japan has 33 confirmed coronavirus cases so far, including 17 people who had been in Wuhan and the 10 on the cruise liner.
Since Saturday, Japan has refused entry to foreigners who have been in Hubei province, where Wuhan is located, and may widen the ban to other parts of China.

People quarantined aboard the Hakuo will be confined to quarters for around 10 days and provided with a tablet computer and Wifi to help them pass the time, the Japanese defence official said. Each will be provided with toiletries and other necessities during their stay, with meals brought to their rooms, he added. (reporting by Tim Kelly; Editing by Raju Gopalakrishnan)"

Some have mentioned that a lot of Wuhanese men may be more prone to smoking and that may be true, but I believe it could be their air quality or certain types of air pollutants, their specific diet there (yes, possibly less clean eating in that specific region), specific gut biomes, certain water microbes they ingest, their specific DNA and/or blood composition, etc, that may mean the Wuhan Coronavirus is more prone to affecting them than others.

De negen landgenoten zijn gisteren uitgebreid getest in het militair hospitaal in Neder-Over-Heembeek. Een van hen blijkt dus besmet te zijn met het nieuwe coronavirus. Het gaat om het eerste Belgische coronageval. “Het was duidelijk een goede beslissing om deze mensen in quarantaine te plaatsen. En ook om stalen te nemen bij mensen die geen symptomen hadden, want dit was een daarvan"", zegt viroloog Marc Van Ranst.

Vanwaar komt het coronavirus? En hoe besmettelijk is het? Een antwoord op de meest gestelde vragen

](https://www.vrt.be/vrtnws/nl/2020/01/31/coronavirus-q-a/)De betrokken persoon is gisteravond meteen overgeplaatst naar het Sint-Pietersziekenhuis in Brussel, een van de twee referentiecentra in ons land voor patiënten met het coronavirus. Viroloog Van Ranst benadrukt dat we ons geen zorgen moeten maken. ""Dit is geen positief geval waar andere gevallen kunnen uit voortkomen. De betrokken persoon is geïsoleerd en binnen een paar dagen is die persoon virusvrij. De patiënt zal wel nog voor de volle 14 dagen onder quarantaine blijven en dan is dit voorbij.""
De testresultaten van de andere landgenoten waren negatief, zij zijn dus niet besmet met het coronavirus. Wereldwijd zijn al meer dan 20.000 mensen besmet met het virus, vooral in China, waar het virus uitbrak. Daar zijn nu ook al meer dan 420 doden gevallen."

So until the facts on the ground are reported thoroughly enough that national governments' insurance/banking regulators will be forced to publicly admit the need/requirement for force mejeur, private industry is hedging risk as fast as possible.

That doesn't mean the actuaries are correct, it means their risk models are now beyond the guidelines of their companies.

Contrary to popular notions, outbreak did not start from wild life trade in huanan seafood market. 17/41 first confirmed cases no exposure to the market. 3/4 earliest cases had no exposure to market. First confirmed case did not have any contact with later cases.

From https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(20)30183-5/fulltext ""Clinical features of patients infected with 2019 novel coronavirus in Wuhan, China."" by Prof Chaolin Huang, MD et al.

This indicates more than one patient 0, which suggests a bioweapon scenario. The virus failed to spread with the first group of targets, so they tried again with the wild life market.

Virus not originating from the illegal wild life trade is a new development that will never be expounded upon by Western media.

The fact that sinophobic trolls and CIA disinformation agents everywhere are preempting with that ludicrous ""China infecting its own people"" conspiracy theory just makes things more suspicious. China is self destructing its own economy at the most sensitive moment in recent history given the US-China confrontation, for what? 

The virus lab leak theory is even more ludicrous for anyone that knows Wuhan geography. The lab is half a city away and separated from the seafood market by the largest frickin river in China. There is no way the virus can magically swim across that river with a width more than a kilometer.

All sign points to biowarfare. It wouldn't be the first time. US used unit 731 technology and dropped specially designed insect filled disease bombs against Chinese and North Korean troops in 1952. Considering that US government tested syphilis on its own black citizens, plausible deniable biowarfare against a foreign communist country of a different race is very possible."

Unfortunately one of them died (in the Philippines) and another one in HK died today, which actually does follow the numbers that have been released from China, I think?

Also Biorxiv releases papers that not peer reviewed.  These are all preliminary.  There's even a notice on the top:

bioRxiv is receiving many new papers on coronavirus 2019-nCoV.   A reminder: these are preliminary reports that have not been peer-reviewed. They should not be regarded as conclusive, guide clinical practice/health-related behavior, or be reported in news media as established information.

It's good to be informed but you have to be careful with taking the word of these papers as gospel.  This is the same site that accepted that Delhi IIT paper that suggested that the coronavirus has similar ""looks"" to HIV and some folks were taking the conclusions of that paper to be possibly bioengineered, which was patently false.

Regarding the asymptomatic thing:

https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2020/02/paper-non-symptomatic-patient-transmitting-coronavirus-wrong

The situation with the virus is volatile and it's important to be informed and up to date.  I do think we should remain skeptical, but the one thing that's shielded us from the worst aspects of the virus is that we have no direct flights to Wuhan.  We have direct flights to other parts of China but those other areas aren't as hard hit (yet).

Seeing how we're all supposed to be ready for things like hurricanes we should be halfway there with our preparedness kits.  Good idea to have a small supply of surgical masks with the proper antiviral filter.  Everyone should have spam and vienna sausage on hand in case SHTF right?"

There's no proof for such claim, and the complementary video doesn't give much information . I searched related keywords ""jail"" ""seven years"" or anything possible in Chinese but nothing came up on People Daily newspaper's social media.

Instead, I searched for more of this author's articles, and similar ones came up: 

[‘FINAL WARNING’ China cops threaten to jail people for seven years if they share news on social media about killer coronavirus spread](https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/10882566/china-threaten-7-years-jail-talk-virus-spread/) 

The video in this article is good: it shows three cops talking to a woman asking her to delete her WeChat message on social media, and also to explain her ""misinformation"", she can send another message saying she ""got it wrong"" in the first place. Otherwise, they will deal with this case in accordance to the law (probably misinformation related).

However, there is no trace of the ""7 years in jail"". And this author never gives proof of ""7 years"" in any of his articles. 

Thus I claim:

What is true: China will jail citizens for sharing information that are not confirmed or released by officials (related to the coronavirus)

What is false: No proof for the claim ""China will jail them for up to 7 years"".

To end on a more positive tone, people in the sub are correct and tell to the OP to go make legal pursuit about it, especially given thé fact that his mother and her friends think that they know who wrote it.

However, the same person is expected to be more sick with this than they would have if they had the flu so the chance of complications is, on average, higher for every age group. The other thing to consider is that even if you are in an age/health group that is extremely unlikely to die from this (despite it being worse than the flu), you still have to be careful not to contact it or transmit it to someone else if you already have it because others who may not be as lucky/healthy/young as you could be at much bigger risk. It kills usually from respiratory complications.

2020-02-04,CosmoPhD,AMD_Stock,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/AMD_Stock/comments/eyfjk1/vmware_caps_percpu_fees_at_32_cores_amds_epyc/fgibf42/,"Speed is important to the desktop market.

Stability and reliability are important to the server market.

Investors here are taking their experience with a personal computer and superimposing those expectations on the server market.

And then when AMD misses the sales they blame it on Intel manipulation because they’re unable to determine why companies aren’t jumping at what is clearly better hardware.  

AVX512 has been beating AMD on its head for about a decade. This 512bit optimization code has insinuated itself in some major server software like Oracle.  I don’t know why AMD CPUs don’t support or benefit from it, but it has become a sales factor. As has AMD drivers and software in general.  

Drivers and software is enough to cause a person to switch from AMD to nVidia and even to Intel in some cases for personal computing. There are plenty of stories popping up on The AMD forum. I’d say that for most Ross isn’t an issue, but that’s for personal computers.  It’s a different game in servers where a bug or bad software can ok was to many hours of downtime, or worse if the company is forced to seek a consultant to get It working.  Before they even css as led the consultant, that server has lost them money.

Due to this, AMD , despite its hardware advantage does not have an advantage in traditional servers.  Their advantage is limited to new customers requiring a sever for the first time and to web servers where Intel’s software and AVX512 advantage doesn’t exist. If you look at AMDs server wins, they all fit that bill.  If you look at sales though, that market doesn’t seem big, but it could be the ramp. 

Anyway, I think the coronavirus changed the game. Since, due to the tarrif war and the corresponding discussions we’ve gad about on here, it’s established that 40% of AMD business is shipped to China for assembly and sales elsewhere. All of that has been disrupted with a large delay due to an absent workforce in China. It’s also been disrupted due to uncertainty around the world. In my experience companies will delay investments under these conditions because they don’t know when full production and full sale revenue will resume, so that money is saved to keep the business running as is 

The actions Chiba took in the market yesterday was for that reason alone. To provide liquidity for companies in China that would have folded due to the stress that coronavirus has on their ongoing operations. That’s why banks were orders not to collect on outstanding loans.

Under those conditions how can you expect AMD to meet guidance? How can you expect similar companies to meet guidance, or more affected companies.  Apple shuttered all of their stores in China during what is one of the most lucrative shopping seasons. How are they going to meet guidance?

What about the people at home under forced quarantine, how are they making money, and if they aren’t how will they buy computer parts? How will they buy computer parts?

The market is at that extreme point where sentiment is so high that we’re sitting at the delusional/ denial phase of the stock market phases.

As a growth stock though it’s not as dangerous as AMD will eventually make the sales to support this stock price again, but damage caused by the reaction to this virus will delay everything by an amount of time dictated by how far this thing spreads before a vaccine is created. 

It’s important to note that rna inhibitors are dangerous. They prevent/mess up/damage the creation of protein in the body and are linked with mitochondrial damage that may be inherited. Compared to death it’s a solution, but compared to a virus that has a ~2% mortality rate, people will take those chances, those are good odds (if it’s at ~2%) as statistics is telling us.
The vaccines represents confidence. The people’s are not confident they can go to work and carry back n their lives safely until they’re vaccinated. This is all about fear. Fear in the market is a recession. This hasn’t been priced in because we’re sitting at the denial stage in the market. 

AMD current evaluation is way ahead of sales, we know this because of the high PE compared to other stocks in the same sector and other companies. It requires a perfect execution to maintain its value.  Look at what I just wrote. Can AMD make those sales if 40% of their market is in jeopardy?

To be clear, a long term hold strategy is good. I think the virus may cause a ~6-9 month delay in sales once this thing blows over after a vaccine is developed.... assuming that the reason MERS doesn’t have a vaccine is because that virus is affecting the middle east. If it’s because MERS has thwarted efforts, then that’s horrible news and things will be much worse."

> Should that happen, Singapore will consider additional measures to reduce human-to-human interactions, such as cancelling mass gatherings, suspending schools, and paring down non-essential care services, to slow the spread of disease.

> The country has been preparing for such clusters, and measures implemented so far have been directed towards preventing and containing the risk of spread beyond such local clusters, to the broader community, MOH said.

> As surveillance has been stepped up, more such local clusters are expected, including more cases of local transmission, it added.

> The ministry has also started contact tracing so as to ringfence the cluster and limit further spread.

> Cases with limited community transmission are not unexpected, said Mr Gan, who co-chairs a multi-ministry task force to defend the country against the virus.

> ""This is a scenario which we are prepared for,"" he said, noting that efforts will help reduce the risk of escalation.

> ""As the situation evolves we will step up our posture accordingly to further contain the situation in Singapore.""

> With local transmission happening here, the Government is stepping up cleaning of public areas, as well as measures to lower the risk for vulnerable groups such as young children and the elderly.

> To keep students safe, for instance, schools will implement staggered recess times, and stop activities such as mass assemblies and school camps. Eldercare facilities will also suspend excursions and large-scale gatherings.

> As an added precaution, the authorities said they are also contacting people with similar profiles to the four cases of local transmission, who have had recent close contact with individuals with travel history to China.

> In addition, all patients with pneumonia at public hospitals have been tested for the 2019-nCoV, as the virus is called, since last week.

> Current evidence suggests that the virus can be spread by droplets from infected individuals, and the best way to prevent this is through personal hygiene and social responsibility. Businesses and organisations are also advised to clean their premises more often, especially high-traffic areas.

> The earlier 18 confirmed cases of the virus here were all imported, comprising 16 Chinese nationals and two Singaporeans who had all travelled recently to Wuhan, the capital of China's Hubei province.

> One has been discharged, said the ministry on Tuesday.

> The update was given after a two-day lull on Sunday and Monday, when no new cases were reported.

> The coronavirus outbreak shows no signs of abating, and while Singapore has put in place multiple lines of defence to check cases coming in from abroad or being passed within the community, it must prepare for a long fight against the virus, Mr Gan told Parliament on Monday.

> It was first reported in Wuhan late last year. As of Monday, it had infected more than 20,000 people and claimed over 420 lives, mainly in China.

> Outside mainland China, there have been close to 300 cases and two deaths, one each in Hong Kong and the Philippines.

> Global authorities have warned of more person-to-person spread, with the United States, Thailand, South Korea and Hong Kong all reporting local transmission.

> On Tuesday, Malaysian health authorities also confirmed the first citizen to be infected with the new coronavirus, bringing the total number of confirmed cases in the country to 10. They said the 41-year-old Malaysian had travelled to Singapore for a meeting last month with colleagues from China - including one from Wuhan. But he showed symptoms only on Jan 29, nearly a week after he returned to Malaysia.

> Chinese data suggest that the new virus, while much more contagious than Sars, is significantly less lethal, although such numbers can evolve rapidly. It very likely passed from certain wild animals to humans at the Wuhan's South China Seafood Market and then evolved into human-to-human transmission.

> Singaporeans are advised to defer all travel to Hubei and all non-essential travel to China, while visitors with recent travel to China or those with Chinese passports will not be allowed entry.

> The six new cases:

> - The 19th case is a 28-year-old Singapore resident, a woman who had no recent travel history to China. She works as a salesperson at health product shop Yong Thai Hang at 24, Cavan Road in Jalan Besar, that primarily served Chinese tourists.

> She developed a sore throat and fever last Wednesday (Jan 29) and was taken to Tan Tock Seng Hospital (TTSH) last Thursday, but was discharged from hospital after her chest X-Ray result came back negative for pneumonia.

> She did not leave her home at Jalan Bukit Merah from Friday to Sunday and was admitted to the Singapore General Hospital (SGH) on Monday.

> - The 20th case is a 48-year-old Singapore resident, a woman who also had no recent travel history to China. She lived at Hougang Street 61 and also worked at Yong Thai Hang.

> She reported symptoms on Jan 25 and was admitted to the National Centre for Infectious Diseases (NCID) on Monday.

> - The 21st case is a 44-year-old Indonesian woman who also had no recent travel history to China. She is the domestic helper of case 19, and stayed with her employer in her home at Jalan Bukit Merah. She reported symptoms on Sunday and did not leave her home since then.

> She was admitted to SGH on Monday.

> The 22nd and 23rd cases are Singapore residents evacuated from Wuhan on Jan 30. They did not have symptoms when they boarded the flight and were quarantined when they landed in Singapore.

> The two cases tested positive for the coronavirus on Monday even though they still showed no symptoms.

> They are now warded in isolation rooms at NCID.

> All Singaporeans evacuated from Wuhan were, as an added precaution, tested for the coronavirus.

> Case 24 is a 32-year-old Singapore resident who has no recent travel history in China.

> She is a tour guide who brought tour groups to Yong Thai Hang, the same shop where cases 19 and 20 worked.

> The tour guide did not show any symptoms when she went to NCID on Monday. She was immediately isolated and is now warded in an isolation room in the centre.

> She tested positive for the virus on Tuesday afternoon.

> Discharged:

> One of the confirmed cases, case seven, a 35-year-old Wuhan resident, has recovered and has tested negative for the virus. He was discharged from NCID on Tuesday.

The medical uses of silver include its use in wound dressings, creams, and as an antibiotic coating on medical devices. Wound dressings containing silver sulfadiazine or silver nanomaterials may be used on external infections. The limited evidence available shows that silver coatings on endotracheal breathing tubes may reduce the incidence of ventilator-associated pneumonia. There is tentative evidence that using silver-alloy indwelling catheters for short-term catheterizing will reduce the risk of catheter acquired urinary tract infections.Silver generally has low toxicity, and minimal risk is expected when silver is used in approved medical applications.

> SINGAPORE - Singapore has recorded its first cases of local coronavirus transmission, with four women here infected who had not travelled to Wuhan, the epicentre of the outbreak.

> Two work at Yong Thai Hang, a Chinese health products shop in Cavan Road in Lavender which caters to Chinese tour groups.

> The third is a maid of one of the women, while the fourth is a tour guide who had taken groups to the same shop.

> The tour group in question has since returned to China.

> In addition, another two confirmed cases were announced on Tuesday (Feb 4).

> The two were among a group of 92 people flown back to Singapore from Wuhan on a Scoot flight last Thursday. Before this, another two on the same flight had been reported as confirmed cases.

> In total, there are now 24 confirmed cases in Singapore.

> The new cases constitute ""limited local transmission"", the Health Ministry said on Tuesday.

> ""There is however no widespread evidence of widespread community transmission,"" said Health Minister Gan Kim Yong at a press conference.

> ""It is possible that there could be broader community spread despite our best efforts,"" he told reporters.

> Should that happen, Singapore will consider additional measures to reduce human-to-human interactions, such as cancelling mass gatherings, suspending schools, and paring down non-essential care services, to slow the spread of disease.

> The country has been preparing for such clusters, and measures implemented so far have been directed towards preventing and containing the risk of spread beyond such local clusters, to the broader community, MOH said.

> As surveillance has been stepped up, more such local clusters are expected, including more cases of local transmission, it added.

> To keep students safe, for instance, schools will implement staggered recess times, and stop activities such as mass assemblies and school camps. Eldercare facilities will also suspend excursions and large-scale gatherings.

> As an added precaution, the authorities said they are also contacting people with similar profiles to the four cases of local transmission, who have had recent close contact with individuals with travel history to China.

> In addition, all patients with pneumonia at public hospitals have been tested for the 2019-nCoV, as the virus is called, since last week.

> Current evidence suggests that the virus can be spread by droplets from infected individuals, and the best way to prevent this is through personal hygiene and social responsibility. Businesses and organisations are also advised to clean their premises more often, especially high-traffic areas.

> The earlier 18 confirmed cases of the virus here were all imported, comprising 16 Chinese nationals and two Singaporeans who had all travelled recently to Wuhan, the capital of China's Hubei province.

> One has been discharged, said the ministry on Tuesday.

> The update was given after a two-day lull on Sunday and Monday, when no new cases were reported.

> The coronavirus outbreak shows no signs of abating, and while Singapore has put in place multiple lines of defence to check cases coming in from abroad or being passed within the community, it must prepare for a long fight against the virus, Mr Gan told Parliament on Monday.

> It was first reported in Wuhan late last year. As of Monday, it had infected more than 20,000 people and claimed over 420 lives, mainly in China.

> Outside mainland China, there have been close to 300 cases and two deaths, one each in Hong Kong and the Philippines.

> Global authorities have warned of more person-to-person spread, with the United States, Thailand, South Korea and Hong Kong all reporting local transmission.

> On Tuesday, Malaysian health authorities also confirmed the first citizen to be infected with the new coronavirus, bringing the total number of confirmed cases in the country to 10. They said the 41-year-old Malaysian had travelled to Singapore for a meeting last month with colleagues from China - including one from Wuhan. But he showed symptoms only on Jan 29, nearly a week after he returned to Malaysia.

> Chinese data suggest that the new virus, while much more contagious than Sars, is significantly less lethal, although such numbers can evolve rapidly. It very likely passed from certain wild animals to humans at the Wuhan's South China Seafood Market and then evolved into human-to-human transmission.

> Singaporeans are advised to defer all travel to Hubei and all non-essential travel to China, while visitors with recent travel to China or those with Chinese passports will not be allowed entry.

> The six new cases:

> - The 19th case is a 28-year-old Singapore resident, a woman who had no recent travel history to China. She works as a salesperson at health product shop Yong Thai Hang at 24, Cavan Road in Jalan Besar, that primarily served Chinese tourists.

> She developed a sore throat and fever last Wednesday (Jan 29) and was taken to Tan Tock Seng Hospital (TTSH) last Thursday, but was discharged from hospital after her chest X-Ray result came back negative for pneumonia.

> She did not leave her home at Jalan Bukit Merah from Friday to Sunday and was admitted to the Singapore General Hospital (SGH) on Monday.

> - The 20th case is a 48-year-old Singapore resident, a woman who also had no recent travel history to China. She lived at Hougang Street 61 and also worked at Yong Thai Hang.

> She reported symptoms on Jan 25 and was admitted to the National Centre for Infectious Diseases (NCID) on Monday.

> - The 21st case is a 44-year-old Indonesian woman who also had no recent travel history to China. She is the domestic helper of case 19, and stayed with her employer in her home at Jalan Bukit Merah. She reported symptoms on Sunday and did not leave her home since then.

> She was admitted to SGH on Monday.

> The 22nd and 23rd cases are Singapore residents evacuated from Wuhan on Jan 30. They did not have symptoms when they boarded the flight and were quarantined when they landed in Singapore.

> The two cases tested positive for the coronavirus on Monday even though they still showed no symptoms.

> They are now warded in isolation rooms at NCID.

> All Singaporeans evacuated from Wuhan were, as an added precaution, tested for the coronavirus.

> Case 24 is a 32-year-old Singapore resident who has no recent travel history in China.

> She is a tour guide who brought tour groups to Yong Thai Hang, the same shop where cases 19 and 20 worked.

> The tour guide did not show any symptoms when she went to NCID on Monday. She was immediately isolated and is now warded in an isolation room in the centre.

> She tested positive for the virus on Tuesday afternoon.

> Discharged:

> One of the confirmed cases, case seven, a 35-year-old Wuhan resident, has recovered and has tested negative for the virus. He was discharged from NCID on Tuesday.

Suffice to say the probability of someone infected with it was higher than I expected it to be, whether it's because I screwed up the math or because we're doomed, I'm not sure.

There is a lot of data I had to make up to be able to do the math though, such as the percentage of the Beijing population (since apparently most of our tourists are from Beijing which is interesting and I did not know^[source](https://www.travelchinaguide.com/tourism/2019statistics/) ) that had the virus over the last two months. I could not find the date of the first coronavirus case confirmed in Beijing, so I do not know when it first spread there. To do the math I assumed that the current confirmed case count for Beijing - 228 - has been a static number for the whole two months this adventure has been going on. Realistically the probability would be significantly lower if I had that date to go by, though of course that still wouldn't account for the number of cases that were never reported since most people just have standard flu symptoms. That 228 number is a really important one and significantly skews the probabilities when adjusted in either direction.

I also operated under the assumption that all people from Beijing were equally likely to visit, and equally likely to have the virus based on the 228 number. Obviously those are huge, obviously false assumptions. Some of the underlying numbers I did source from actual facts did not seem to add up correctly, either, such as the number of visitors from Beijing to the US compared to the numbers specific to Hawaii.

Let's all just wash our hands in boiling hot water and not worry about it, okay?"

An eight-year-old boy has been confirmed as Queensland's third case of the potentially deadly coronavirus.
The child, who is Chinese and from the virus epicentre of Wuhan, was confirmed to have the virus by Queensland health officials on Tuesday night.

He was travelling in the same tour group as the 44-year-old man and a 42-year-old woman who have been confirmed as Queensland's other cases of coronavirus.
The child remains in isolation at the Gold Coast University Hospital and is currently stable.
More to come."

Ändert halt trotzdem nichts an dem was ich dazu schlussfolgernd geschrieben habe. 

> DLF Der Tag Podcast, ebenfalls vom Donnerstag:

Der Titel der Sendung war **""Die irrationale Angst vor dem Virus""** 

> Wie Chinesen mit dem Ausbruch der Coronavirus umgehen, wie sie an ihrer Regierung zweifeln und im Ausland angefeindet werden.

In der Einleitung sagt sie: ""...wir widmen uns gleich den **politischen und gesellschaftlichen** Aspekten der Ausbreitung""

Darum ging es und es ist durchaus interessant auch diese Aspekte zu beleuchten. Dazu gehört dann auch die Tatsache, dass die Presse in China staatlich zensiert wird da das ja Teil des Problems vor allem in den ersten Tagen war. Ironischerweise ist das auch ein Krenaspekt des Unterschieds zwischen China und uns (siehe oben). 

Warum du denkst, dass dieser spezielle Beitrag (im negativen Sinne) repräsentativ wäre für die Berichterstattung hier ist mir weiterhin gänzlich unverständlich. Sie ist nicht einmal repräsentativ für die Berichterstattung beim Deutschlandfunk. Siehe z.B. [hier](https://www.deutschlandfunk.de/lungenkrankheit-wie-gefaehrlich-ist-das-neuartige.2897.de.html?dram:article_id=468313). 

> Mir geht es übrigens nicht darum Panik zu verbreiten, auch wenn du mir das unterstellst. 

Naja, du meintest z.B. die Medien würden die Krankheit als ""harmlos"" darstellen. Das ist nicht wahr. Daraus schließe ich logischerweise, dass du dir eine drastischere Darstellung wünschen würdest. Angesichts der Tatsache, dass die Berichterstattung meiner Meinung nach größtenteils ausgewogen ruhig gewesen ist, wäre die die du sehen wollen würdest eine die man an den Randbereichen der deutschen Presse findet. Eine die von eben Panik und dramatisierter Darstellung geprägt ist."

He never posted anything about the Coronavirus or China and a bio weapon until the news started coming out, yet he now magically has articles on his site dated as far back as 2013 in an effort to make it look like he had been covering aspects of the story for years, and especially through mid to late 2019.

In fact, he just backdated the posts in the WordPress database, unfortunately for him there are 2 problems:

1. He does not know that WordPress will still arrange them in the order they are written unless you modify it in a particular way. Because of this, the posts are listed in the real order on his blog and it’s obvious that the date was simply edited. There are old articles mixed in with new ones, and the rest are all sorted properly by date.

2. archive.org has several snapshots of his site throughout 2014 to the Present - none of these posts existed! The only post even remotely related would have been one from August 19th about the “Thousand Talents” program, but did not specifically mention anything that would tie it to this story at the time - note that it has now been edited as recently as Feb 3rd, 2020.

He did not post a single story about Coronavirus or a Chinese Bioweapons program until January 24th, 2020!

But don’t take my word for it, here’s a snapshot from late October:

https://web.archive.org/web/20191020163059/http://greatgameindia.com/

Yet he now has posts including “Canadian Lab Acquires Coronavirus Sample” dated May 16, 2013, to the alleged theft of the virus July 23, 2019, and other Coronavirus stories sprinkled around including more posts in August, and October.

Here you can see that even in November 2019 there were no posts related to Coronavirus:

https://web.archive.org/web/20191128042808/http://greatgameindia.com/category/science-society/

Also look at his Twitter. Historically there are ZERO posts regarding the Coronavirus or a Chinese Biowarfare Program before January 2020."

Which means they’re not expecting there to be any complications with the other 87% of the population. If we take the numbers from the lanclet study that showed 15% of people that came in with pneumonia died, and apply that here, then that would be an additional 390.


And again, this doesn’t count mild and asymptomatic cases that aren’t sending people to be tested. The current estimate for total infections is 75000.

That would give us a death toll of 815 out of a total population of 75K... which is a hair over 1% mortality. Maybe throw in a few more deaths in that larger undiagnosed group, but at a lower rate, because their cases aren’t as severe for the most part."

The Wuhan links with Harvard are far more interesting to me than Winnipeg - it suggests a systematic program by the Chinese to overtake the US on Biotech warfare research and development - independent of whether it is directly related to the coronavirus. Also don't expect accurate reporting from any country that is actively involved and heavily spending on research and development in this area.

"" By Walter Russell Mead

Feb. 3, 2020 6:47 pm ET 

The mighty Chinese juggernaut has been humbled this week, apparently by a species-hopping bat virus. While Chinese authorities struggle to control the epidemic and restart their economy, a world that has grown accustomed to contemplating China’s inexorable rise was reminded that nothing, not even Beijing’s power, can be taken for granted.

&#x200B;

We do not know how dangerous the new coronavirus will be. There are signs that Chinese authorities are still trying to conceal the true scale of the problem, but at this point the virus appears to be more contagious but considerably less deadly than the pathogens behind diseases such as Ebola or SARS—though some experts say SARS and coronavirus are about equally contagious.

&#x200B;

China’s initial response to the crisis was less than impressive. The Wuhan government was secretive and self-serving; national authorities responded vigorously but, it currently appears, ineffectively. China’s cities and factories are shutting down; the virus continues to spread. We can hope that authorities succeed in containing the epidemic and treating its victims, but the performance to date has shaken confidence in the Chinese Communist Party at home and abroad. Complaints in Beijing about the U.S. refusing entry to noncitizens who recently spent time in China cannot hide the reality that the decisions that allowed the epidemic to spread as far and as fast as it did were all made in Wuhan and Beijing.

&#x200B;

The likeliest economic consequence of the coronavirus epidemic, forecasters expect, will be a short and sharp fall in Chinese economic growth rates during the first quarter, recovering as the disease fades. The most important longer-term outcome would appear to be a strengthening of a trend for global companies to “de-Sinicize” their supply chains. Add the continuing public health worries to the threat of new trade wars, and supply-chain diversification begins to look prudent.

&#x200B;

Events like the coronavirus epidemic, and its predecessors—such as SARS, Ebola and MERS—test our systems and force us to think about the unthinkable. If there were a disease as deadly as Ebola and as fast-spreading as coronavirus, how should the U.S. respond? What national and international systems need to be in place to minimize the chance of catastrophe on this scale?

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Epidemics also lead us to think about geopolitical and economic hypotheticals. We have seen financial markets shudder and commodity prices fall in the face of what hopefully will be a short-lived disturbance in China’s economic growth. What would happen if—perhaps in response to an epidemic, but more likely following a massive financial collapse—China’s economy were to suffer a long period of even slower growth? What would be the impact of such developments on China’s political stability, on its attitude toward the rest of the world, and to the global balance of power?

&#x200B;

China’s financial markets are probably more dangerous in the long run than China’s wildlife markets. Given the accumulated costs of decades of state-driven lending, massive malfeasance by local officials in cahoots with local banks, a towering property bubble, and vast industrial overcapacity, China is as ripe as a country can be for a massive economic correction. Even a small initial shock could lead to a massive bonfire of the vanities as all the false values, inflated expectations and misallocated assets implode. If that comes, it is far from clear that China’s regulators and decision makers have the technical skills or the political authority to minimize the damage—especially since that would involve enormous losses to the wealth of the politically connected.

&#x200B;

We cannot know when or even if a catastrophe of this scale will take place, but students of geopolitics and international affairs—not to mention business leaders and investors—need to bear in mind that China’s power, impressive as it is, remains brittle. A deadlier virus or a financial-market contagion could transform China’s economic and political outlook at any time.

&#x200B;

Many now fear the coronavirus will become a global pandemic. The consequences of a Chinese economic meltdown would travel with the same sweeping inexorability. Commodity prices around the world would slump, supply chains would break down, and few financial institutions anywhere could escape the knock-on consequences. Recovery in China and elsewhere could be slow, and the social and political effects could be dramatic.

&#x200B;

If Beijing’s geopolitical footprint shrank as a result, the global consequences might also be surprising. Some would expect a return of unipolarity if the only possible great-power rival to the U.S. were to withdraw from the game. Yet in the world of American politics, isolation rather than engagement might surge to the fore. If the China challenge fades, many Americans are likely to assume that the U.S. can safely reduce its global commitments.

&#x200B;

So far, the 21st century has been an age of black swans. From 9/11 to President Trump’s election and Brexit, low-probability, high-impact events have reshaped the world order. That age isn’t over, and of the black swans still to arrive, the coronavirus epidemic is unlikely to be the last to materialize in China."""

As far as the coronavirus goes, I'm in touch with old colleagues at Johns Hopkins. It's definitely a pandemic at this point and they're scared shitless. Reported cases are a fraction of the reality because of the lag factor. It's not 'here' in the U.S. to whatever extent yet, but the ICU's and respirators are already in use with the usual flu cases that winter brings. Anything more will completely flood the system with people that cannot be treated in any definitive sense, and since medical personnel realize what 'novel virus' means, AKA 'something no one on the planet has immunities to' the percentages that will be martyrs about it will be minimal.

""The export boom from that trade deal will take longer because of the Chinese virus, that is true,"" Kudlow said on Fox Business.
China has not formally asked for consultations on meeting a commitment to buy $200 billion in U.S. farm goods, energy products and other goods and services over the next two years. The deal, signed last month by President Donald Trump, will go into effect on Feb. 14.

Kudlow said he didn't ""wish China any ill whatsoever,"" but said the coronavirus could spur business investment in the U.S.

""You may get a step up in production here in the U.S., which would be very beneficial,"" he said.
The White House adviser said there could be a decrease in exports and production in China, particularly in the pharmaceutical sector, and ""some things kind of in the middle when you get to automobiles and auto parts, but there is a lot we don't know."""

In this sense he is not so different from Han Kuo-yu, only Ko has been able to dress up his populist rhetoric by appealing to fact-based science as his principle of governance.

Ko has previously criticized our government for not keeping secrets when the media leaked his plan to establish a new political party. He has also praised CCP bureaucrats for being “higher quality” than those in Taiwan and in the same context, questioned whether democracy is really the best political system. For these reasons, his current argument for transparency makes him look like a hypocrite who is simply jealous of the mostly positive public response so far to the Ministry of Health’s actions against the spread of coronavirus in Taiwan."

Wenjun Wang is a 33-year-old resident of Wuhan. Her entire family is there and has been sealed off from the outside world since January 24th. In this rare interview, she tells the BBC’s Razia Iqbal her family’s heart-breaking story.

**Transcript:**

**Wenjung Wang:** Since the outbreak of the Corona virus my Uncle has already passed away. My Father is critically ill now, and my Mom and Aunt have started showing some symptoms, and the CT scans shows their lungs are infected. My Brother is coughing too and has some breathing difficulties.

My Dad has a high fever now. His temperature was 39.3 yesterday and he's constantly coughing and having breathing difficulties. We bought him an oxygen machine at home and he relies on that 24/7.

There's no hospital for him to go to because his case hasn't been confirmed due to the lack testing kits in the hospitals. My Mom and Aunt walk to the hospital everyday in the hope of getting a bed for my dad, despite their own health situation. But no hospital will take them.

**BBC Newshour Interviewer:** Would you say that you are being supported by the authorities, because there is no hospital bed for your family members who are clearly struggling? Are you getting the help that you need from the authorities?

**Wenjung Wang:** Well the situation here now in Wuhan is there's many quarantine points to accommodate patients who have slight symptoms or who are still in the incubation period. There are some simple and really basic facilities there. But for people who are critically ill, like my Father, there are no beds for them. My Uncle actually died in one of the quarantine points because there are no medical facilities for people with severe symptoms.

I really hope my father could get some proper treatment, but no one is in contact with us or helping us at the moment. I got in touch with the community workers several times, but the response I got was there's no chance of us getting a bed in the hospital. The quarantine point that they asked my Uncle and my Dad to go... we thought it was a hospital at the beginning, but it turned out to be a hotel. There was no nurse or doctor, and there was no heater. They went in the afternoon and the staff there served them a cold dinner that evening. My Uncle was very ill then with severe respiratory symptoms and started losing consciousness, but no doctor came to treat him. He and my dad stayed in separate rooms, and when Dad went to see him in the morning at 6:30, he had already passed away (voice cracking).

**BBC Newshour Interviewer:** I-I'm so sorry to hear how distressed you are. Um, the authorities are saying that there is a 1000 bed hospital which has already been built, and there is a 2nd hospital with 1600 beds that will be operational later this week. Do you believe them?

**Wenjung Wang:** I don't know if other people believe that or are hopeful for that, but I don't. Because those new build hospitals are for people who are already in other hospitals at the moment, and who are going to be transferred to the new ones. But for people like us, we can't even get a bed now, let alone get one in the new hospitals. If we follow the government guidelines, the only place we can go now is those quarantine points. But if we went, what happened to my Uncle would then happen to Dad, so we'd rather die at home.

**BBC Newshour Interviewer:** Um, that all sounds pretty bleak for you... I wonder if you would just describe for us the atmosphere in Wuhan?

**Wenjung Wang:** There are many families like us around, all facing the same difficulties. One of my friend's Fathers was even refused by staff at the quarantine points because he had a high fever. Resources are limited, yet the infected population is huge. We are afraid. We don't know what will happen next.

**BBC Newshour Interviewer:** Is there a single message that you have for your own government, and the rest of the world?

**Wenjung Wang:** What I want to say is...if I knew that they were going to lock down the city on the 24th of January I would definitely have taken my whole family out of the city, because there is no help here. If we were somewhere else, there might be hope. I don't know whether people like us, who listened to the government and stayed in Wuhan, made the right decision or not...but I think my Uncle's death has answered that question."

2020-02-04,CLO_Junkie,Coronavirus,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/eyx6fh/hedge_funds_hold_their_nerve_on_china_seek/fgjsxtb/," SHANGHAI/NEW YORK (Reuters) - Hedge funds are holding their nerve on China’s ability to rebound quickly from a coronavirus outbreak that has rattled global markets, but many are also adding caveats as they try to predict the potential economic fallout.  

Mainland China stocks tumbled on Monday, when Shanghai and Shenzhen markets opened after an extended Lunar New Year break, wiping out nearly $700 billion in market capitalization.

But the broad blue-chip CSI 300 [.CSI300](https://www.reuters.com/finance/markets/index?symbol=.CSI300), which fell almost 8% on Monday, rose 2.5% on Tuesday. European and U.S. markets followed later in the day: the S&P 500 [.SPX](https://www.reuters.com/finance/markets/index?symbol=.SPX) benchmark U.S. index was up more than 1% in early trading.

“In a crisis, everyone feels the sky is falling. But the sky does not fall in the end,” said Gu Weiyong, chief investment officer at Shanghai-based hedge fund manager Ucom Investment Co."

Try ibuprofen(Advil/Motrin) for infants(make sure you dose according to weight!) works much better than acetaminophen(Tylenol). Does he become his normal self  when the fever goes down? If yes that's a good sign.
The mucus and phlegm is really tough on the little ones so you have to do something about it. Get yourself some Salinex or saline water drops for babies and clean his nose at least twice per day. Also, put a humidifier in their room if you are using heat, it will help with the stuffy nose.
Finally what really helps my kids to sleep better when they have a runny nose is a tiny bit of menthol rub for infants on the chest(Baby Vick's or Mentholatum). I hope there are suitable alternatives in China and please make sure that you use medications for infants.
Don't forget that despite the seriousness of the coronavirus, a hospital is still the best bet if your little one is really not doing well. Godspoed to you both!"

It’s true we need to increase our capacity for testing and lower the threshold of suspicion. To be fair, even if they did have the capacity to test everybody who got a fever and cough, the system would be quickly overloaded dealing with every case and the health system would deteriorate very quickly.

It sounds at this stage you’ve no reason to suspect Coronavirus - you mention you have musician friends to play packed arenas, have any of them been ill? Most people would have contact with people who have contact with large crowds, so again, it’s not necessarily a reason to suspect coronavirus or to absorb a resource with lack of any other reason.

In times like this, we obviously will all panic if we get a cough or fever, but we won’t beat this if we all expect tests to reassure as for each cough or fever, when there are going to be very many people with far more reason to suspect he virus and very soon, far more need of intensive treatment.

If we are to beat this, as a global community we have to rely on each other thinking of the wider impact of everything we do. We want that test to reassure ourselves. But at this stage, the suspicion you are infected is incredibly low according to your history, you’re not showing pneumonia signs or serious illness, and it is very safe at this stage for you to elect to self isolate and see how your fever and cough go for now. 

If you are not seriously ill, the most important thing is not to infect anyone else. If you start to get seriously ill or have atypical symptoms, then there would be cause for concern for your wellbeing and I’m sure the health community would also show more concern at that stage. I don’t feel alarmed at all that they’re not suspecting coronavirus from your history or a same day onset of fever and cough. I would be alarmed if they tested everyone who got a fever and cough that day, especially at this stage with no real history of confirmed or even suspect contact with another ill person."
2020-02-04,Dickyknee85,worldnews,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/eui9ui/live_thread_wuhan_coronavirus/fgjts6j/,"Well coronavirus is a very common virus found in multiple animals, particularly bats. It is essentially a common cold virus.

The unhygienic conditions of the wet meat markets, which have always been a threat for outbreaks like this, and is the epicenter of the first few dozen cases.

There is very little to no evidence that this was engineered, apart from circumstantial, which is how your typical conspiracy theory begins. Like I said, it's fair to speculate that it might be, but there is no real evidence...yet."
