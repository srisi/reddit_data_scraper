It's that this virus has an extremely high infection rate, and causes pneumonia.  
Pneumonia is not really serious in most cases, and the cases it is serious in, it is treatable with care from staying in a hospital.  


This being said, the first few cases, it is no big deal, then the infection spreads and more people get pneumonia, filling up the hospitals... Once they are filled... It is game over. Now you have people with pneumonia in the middle of winter with no medical care."

You can be infected for up to 2 weeks and have no symptoms.

Then you can have a week of mild symptoms. No reason to get upset.

After this point is where you either improve, or start to get worse. People might wait another week before going to a hospital.

Ask again in a month.

Edit: For reference, the first known case was around Dec 8th. The government didn't start taking it seriously until 3 weeks later, at which point only around 40 people had actually been diagnosed. The number of diagnoses didn't change for another 2 weeks while they kept things on the down low (some say they ran out of test kits). Then all hell broke loose. So yeah, give it a month or so."

The market hasn't crashed because they pumped a ton of money into it.  China put in Billions. The next day Chinese stocks rose higher than they should have.  Stocks I have been tracking or seeing for years moved much higher on this large amount of money being injected into the markets and China guaranteeing purchases.

I do not know which way this will go, and I cannot predict it.  Scientists and Experts are trying using estimates and models.

The action of our country is either being done privately or are non-existent as far as I am concerned we are not doing enough to stop the spread of the virus

Right now its a wait and see,  we must wait to see what information comes out.

I have never seen anyone go to their Dr. with the Flu Symptoms and it shut down entire Cities and Countries.  Nor have I ever been to my local Dr and or hospital to see an entire medical staff in Hazmat Suits.

We don't need Conspiracy as the truth is plain to see for those who are able to understand what they are seeing.

A city of 11 Million with hospitals Full and people waiting to get in them, they build 11 More Hospitals and those are full now.  Next patients will just be abandoned because the staff is exhausted and cannot handle the influx or they too get sick and die. Which evidence suggests this is already happening. 

On top of entire economies, countries, and cities all beginning to shut down people are so readily able to believe it is all being done for only 600 or so deaths?

I have to question the person who cannot see this.

If folks aren't educated on how bad things could get it will simply be business as usual and this thing will spread exponentially.

History is repeating itself. Both made their way up into a wealthy superpower. The problem is that system is inherently broken. There was a huge toll on the populace for them to get industrialised and bring people into the middle class. Once they reached a certain point, the system begins to run its course. Since it is a top-down system (meaning everything always depends on the guy higher up than you), people start not doing their jobs, or can fake doing their jobs and when things go wrong, no one claims responsibility. When everyone starts scrambling to get things done, they can't because its already broken from the bottom up. All those times they told their superiors that everything was fine, and going well, suddenly begins to fall apart. The guy at the top assumes everyone is doing their job because of how powerful and strong-armed he or she is. Now to keep their positions and preserve the party (because they believe no one else can run the country correctly other than them), everyone from top down has to crack down on people to show they actually are doing something and keep everyone in line. They start doing crazy things or doing the wrong move, but none can say anything for fear of being reprimanded. Then you enter the shit show. People now see through their bullshit, and there is nothing they can do it about now. With the world and its own people not having confidence, the system inevitably crumbles because you can only hold the pile of bullshit up for so long.

Coronavirus is dominating the headlines due to the primal, inherent fear of contagion that unites humanity. In this case, our fears are warranted.

Recent coverage has been walking a fine line between simultaneously reporting the facts and seeking to calm the waters. The risk of coronavirus to the U.S. is low. You have a much greater chance of dying from the flu. And so on.

This is true at the moment. But we are clearly in the early stages of a global pandemic, and coronavirus is much nastier than the flu. Exactly how much nastier remains to be seen, but we are at the mercy of forces largely beyond our control now.

The current best estimates place the [mortality](https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/coronavirus-death-rate/) of coronavirus [between 1% and 3%](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/world/asia/china-coronavirus-contain.html#virulence) with modern medical care. This only sounds low; in fact, it is a very high number. Seasonal influenza kills about 0.1% of patients with the virus, which translates to roughly 650,000 deaths around the world every year.

Coronavirus is more infectious than the flu, and possibly a lot more infectious. If the current numbers are to be believed, it is at least 10 times as lethal as the flu today, which puts it close to the virulence of the influenza strain that killed 50 million people in 1918. Despite medical advances, the world is far more crowded, and hence more vulnerable, than it was in 1918.

Coverage of the conditions in Wuhan has, at times, taken a faintly patronizing tone. Hospital footage of people lying in hallways and masked crowds waiting for days has been shown with the subtle though distinct implication that such scenes would not happen here.

This implication is wrong. This is exactly what would happen here, because the U.S. is not remotely prepared for a coronavirus pandemic. The reason for this is simple: there is hardly any excess capacity built into the U.S. health-care system.

American medicine is designed for profit, not for public health. Hospitals are kept as full as possible all of the time. Empty beds are expensive, and hospitals lose money on them. So there aren’t many empty beds.

In normal circumstances, this rationed market-driven approach works almost well enough. But any significant surge in seriously ill patients will quickly grind our already overloaded system to a halt, and cause secondary effects far beyond the impact of this particular virus.

On any given day, the emergency room where I work can have 40 or 50 patients waiting for many hours in the lobby to be seen, and often a greater number than that.

The emergency room itself is often filled with admitted patients waiting for beds to open in the hospital above us. In many cases, they wait in the ER for days.

When overcrowding like this occurs, which is common everywhere in the U.S., we have no place to see new patients, and try to examine them in the hall or even the lobby itself. Both efficiency and patient safety plummet as a result.

ICU beds are already at a premium, and are already precious things That’s business as usual."

-China is struggling to keep Wuhan alive while claiming all is under control by feeding us fake numbers of infected and dead. Their numbers are, as of right now: 639 dead, roughly 5500 in serious and critical condition (which could mean 2500 on life support). The city is on the edge of turmoil. Forced quarantine by desperate measures. 

-61 on one cruise ship positive for NCov, rest of ship quarantined 14 days.

-Another ship as well is under quarantine.

-on 2/6 there are 268 Known Positive Coronavirus cases across 26 countries. The timeframe for these cases becoming “critical” is just starting. Expect more “critical” patients in the next few days. International as well as China’s case are still moving at a high exponential trajectory.

This virus is related to SARS and MERS, but new to medical science.

There are estimates that this virus has been circulating the population starting somewhere between October and November 2019. The Chinese government did everything they could (it seems) to keep it under wraps.

The virus causes pneumonia and presents with flu like symptoms otherwise. Once exposed it takes between 4 and 14 days to incubate and for the carrier to show symptoms. It is likely that the virus can be spread without the carrier showing symptoms.

We currently do not know the total number of cases or deaths, as it's been suspected / exposed the Chinese government is concealing the true numbers. We can only guess by their know reaction / internal measures that the situation in China is likely very bad.

How bad is the virus? Well, also not fully known. *It appears* at this stage to be very survivable if you have access to modern medical treatment. The biggest issues / risks are twofold: the virus is highly contagious. Estimates show on the high end that it is 4 times more contagious than the flu. The second risk is if it continues to spread, it will strain medical systems degrading the standard of care as supplies are quickly exhausted. This is where the instances of death begin to skyrocket, as we are seeing glimpses of from China.

That is about all we know / professionals can guess."

I've been paying very close attention to the other signs (for example, stock market and investor behavior, military actions across the world, supply line status, various information leaks from various countries, government actions based on economic impacts vs protective measures etc) and all of them are starting to paint a very clear picture and that is a big deal. Bigger than any officials are letting on in terms of informing the public.

The first cases of a new type of swine flu are reported in California and Texas in late March. Subsequent genetic analysis suggests that it may have started circulating in humans in January.

April 2009
On 27 April, with 900 cases of suspected swine flu reported in Mexico, the World Health Organization (WHO) upgrades the pandemic warning level from 3 to 4 on a six-point scale. Intensive efforts to understand the virus and develop a vaccine begin immediately.

The US government advises against travel to Mexico, although research suggests that travel bans will not stop the virus spreading.

Although swine flu seems to be spreading slowly, it is still progressing quickly enough to justify preparing for a pandemic. However, the WHO delays declaring a pandemic, partly because there is not enough evidence that the virus is spreading in the general population outside the Americas, where it originated.

New Scientist reveals that Europe is not testing people with flu symptoms unless they have recently travelled to an affected area in the Americas, or have had close contact with someone who did. As a result, Europe cannot detect spread in the general population. These restrictions may be making the pandemic “invisible” to the monitoring authorities.

..WE ARE HERE..

As concerns mount, it transpires that many countries are poorly prepared for this scenario and that supplies of H1N1 vaccine cannot be prepared in time to catch the second wave.

June 2009
The UK and other countries change their rules and start testing people who have flu but no North American contacts. Cases of swine flu are soon detected.

On 11 June the WHO officially declares swine flu to be a pandemic.""

2020-02-06,Cosmicpixie,Coronavirus,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/ezvs2k/how_are_young_people_dying_from_this/fgpt8bx/,"Coronaviruses typically cause colds. This particluar one, 2019-nCoV, is more than a cold. It's a fairly lethal viral pneumonia. It has an affinity for certain ACE receptors, which are prominent in the lungs, intestines, and kidneys. It hits those tissues hardest, culminating in respiratory and kidney failure in the worst cases. Because it has an affinity for the gut, there can be GI symptoms. The virus is not just shed from mucosa of the respiratory tract, it is shed by the gut and spread through vomit and the fecal-oral route as well. It is rumored to have an affinity for the epithelia of the eye but I'm not well read on that yet. 20% of the infected require ICU care and roughly 4% die. 

It has an R naught of about 4, meaning each infected person goes on to infect 4 others. R naught is not deterministic--it is impacted by quarantines and isolation. These measures will help. Incubation period of up to 14 days but usually shows up in 5. Unclear if it can spread when asymptomatic. Some cases indicated that could happen, later turns out the case subject was taking fever reducers (so was actually symptomatic). 

Air travel is a slow rolling nightmare. We are weeks behind the data because of a lag in test results and lack of testing kits in China. China is not at all transparent about the actual number of cases or dead. The mortality rate can rise over time, especially if hospitals become overwhelmed. The mortality rate of SARS rose over time from 3.5% at the start to 10% at the end of its run. Only time will tell how this goes. So far it is more infectious than flu and SARS. It has infected more people in one month than SARS did in 9 months.

This is not a flu."

1) almost all of the cases outside of China are people who travelled directly from Wuhan. Now that the city is on lockdown and flights to and from China are being grounded, there is no rational reason to expect the number of cases in other countries to continue to increase at the same rate as they have up until now.

2) expecting the number of cases outside of China to follow the same trend as the cases inside China makes no sense at all. The country is on lockdown. People in Wuhan cannot leave and so are forced to stay trapped in their petri dish, greatly increasing the risk of infection for those people. Meanwhile, outside of China, confirmed cases are quarantined and isolated from the population at large in healthcare facilities which are not overwhelmed to the point of collapse, as they are in the worst affected areas in China."

As soon as a 3rd world country / country with shit health and hygiene standards gets hit if travel isn't instantly stopped with that country it could spread. And considering how long it takes for the virus to show symptoms, if we don't preemptively stop travels with potentially infected countries we will never react in time.

IMO we're already there with India. Their one region that has good health infrastructure standards is identifying cases as we speak with several thousands suspected cases on standby. If that's their best region, imagine their worst.

For this to be contained by 5th of March it would have needed to start in a non-totalitarian country with good health monitoring, the opposite of China. nCoV got too much of a headstart because of the way the CCP deals with issues so now we can only do damage control imo.

I'm a data analyst and you can't use the number of confirmed tests to be your total population you're comparing because those people are still incubating.  And since we've been told the incubation cycle is anywhere between 2-14 days, if we look at the confirmed cases just 14 days ago, we were just between 1,000-2,000 positive-tested civilians.    


As you say, you need to divide the deaths by the sum of the deaths and the recovered to find the current fatality rate.  Now, that is not a fixed rate and the numbers will change and the % will fluctuate.  From what I've been seeing since the beginning of this month, we've been seeing a 28-35% fatality rate against the numbers, which is quite alarming.  


Though, as others have pointed out, China is not publishing completely accurate counts, so this data we have is not really helpful except the deaths and recovered outside China.  Since it went worldwide not long ago, we have to give the data more time before we start drawing conclusions about ratios and death rates and only compare the reported cases outside China.   


And that brings up another problem, the CDC is no longer publishing their counts/statistics for us to use. There is a petition floating around to force the CDC to provide us with the facts. The CDC does not want to stir an economy crisis through fear and chaos during this time without a vaccine, so that is my guess as to why they stopped reporting numbers.  I could be wrong but my city (Houston) was screwed when the government told us not to worry about Hurricane Harvey and a leaker told us what the government knew and we were going to be hit hard, and the mainstream media said not to listen to the leaker and she was fake news.  The government NOR media apologized for lying to us Houstonians."

edit: I read in a survival book this recommended portion should be eaten once a day and then the rest of the day no food because everytime when you eat your body needs resources for suggestion so less frequent eating will take less resources of your body.

Fear will drive people to unheard of atrocities. An informed public is essential to that. Unfortunately in today's environment people are rightfully questioning the accuracy of what we hear. The media sensationalizes everything so much these days. The thought of an illness can be so much greater than the sickness. I had Renal Cancer 4 years ago and a heart attack 2 years ago and I learned how much a good attitude helps when you are really sick. They took my right Kidney for the cancer and I exercised my way back from the heart attack.  This is bad but if you are healthy to start and don't give up you will be fine. If  your like me you just need to be careful, extra sanitary and keep up your health and I will be fine too. Listen to the news but with a grain of salt and do what the doctors tell you. It will end and your life will give you plenty to really worry over."

TOKYO (Reuters) - Another 41 people on a cruise liner off Japan tested positive for coronavirus, bringing the total confirmed from the ship to 61, Japan’s health minister said on Friday.

***The new cases were out of the 171 remaining test results, he said.***

The drastic jump in infected passengers on the cruise vessel comes as the cruise ship was under the two-week quarantine with about 3,700 people inside.

And tobacco cigarettes (but not the nicotine vapes, I \_think\_) have a nasty thing called ""tar"" in it (this is what turns walls and shit yellow), and THAT stuff will gunk up your lungs something bad.

Marijuana smoke lacks the tar, but it's still particulate; using a bong can help, but I'm sure some of the gunk you get on your bong gets into your lungs, too.  Not to mention additives or whatnot that can be found in badly made concentrates and vapes.

&#x200B;

As for vapes, well, it's not quite smoke, and though I love to vape honey oil, I would never say it's ""safe"" in any way, but like anything, done in moderation, you're probably OK.  The recent kerfuffle about killer vape carts had to do with dumbasses using edible oils as a base.

Living for years and years in really bad air pollution will do a number on your lungs, too.

2020-02-06,multiple4,Coronavirus,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/f00fwd/turning_coronovirus_into_racial_issue/fgqppeg/,"I don't have any problem with somebody just simply trying to avoid sitting next to or having heavy contact with Chinese people right now if there are other seats available or whatever. The overwhelming majority of people with the virus are Chinese. That's just a fact. Many Chinese people left the country before flights were stopped. That's a fact. So just simply keeping distance from somebody isn't racist. Like you said, it is a normal reaction. When it becomes racist is when people begin to directly reject someone from sitting next to them or refusing to serve them just because they're Chinese. Directly acting rude to somebody just bc they're Chinese isn't ok. But I choose not to sit beside people for all kinds of reasons. There's nothing wrong with that

If you saw a person wearing all black with a hood on and they looked intimidating and they made you feel uncomfortable, then you wouldn't sit next to them. So if you're concerned that a Chinese person is coughing or looks kind of sick then why would you sit next to them?"

From what I've read about infections it's all about the first days. If the threat is confirmed to be very infectious (like this nCoV is) then containing it is basically all about making sure it doesn't spread outside the epicenter or that if it does contacts are easily trackable. For nCoV we got the exact opposite: the first days were nothing but denial and information suppression from China, the virus spread outside the epicenter very fast with no hope of tracking contacts and, cherry on the deadly cake its inherently very infectuous with a high R-0, asymptomatic transmission and the usual coronavirus stuff like the ability to live on surfaces for days.

I'll add that imo, and that's pure speculation, the reason the WHO seems to give 0 fucks about actually making sure we contain this thing is because they know it's too late, so might as well keep China happy by not advising travel bans left and right."

what they need to do is enforce the quarantine for 14 days AFTER THE LAST person tests positive.  so if someone tests positive on day 13, they institute another 14 day quarantine.  if another persons tests positive on day 26, they institute another 14 day quarantine.  rinse and repeat.

They always have to. Even if you thought we missed, you still prepare for the worst; there is little downside to being overprepared in this case.

The US is likely at a ~25% detection rate so there could be cases spreading but we interdict and treat at a much higher level and have more resources. We are also far more spread out than China.

I am not optimistic we will have no impact in the US or globally in countries it has spread to. I am optimistic it will not be nearly as bad as Wuhan where they were blindsided and in a very poor situation (high density, low health care per capita, slow reaction, no understanding of disease pattern out of the gate, etc.)."

I can start off by putting it into perspective by telling you I often get asked — we have an influenza outbreak here.  We have about 8,000 deaths already.  We have about 100,000 hospitalizations.  Why are we paying such attention?  And why are we doing the kinds of things we’re doing here right now?

Well, the reason is, **despite the morbidity and mortality with influenza, there’s a certainty**, for example, of seasonal flu.  I can tell you all, guaranteed, that as we get into March and April, the flu cases are going to go down.  You could predict pretty accurately what the range of the mortality is and the hospitalizations, as we’ve done over the years.

**The issue now with this is that there’s a lot of unknowns.** As you can see just from the media, the number of cases have steeply inclined each and every day.

at risk of downvotes raining down upon me:

i am not a conspiracy theorist by nature, and i believe very firmly in occam's razor.  unfortunately, in this case, i think occam's razor benefits the conspiracy theorists.

i have to admit, at least two weeks ago, i vibed more strongly this was a test virus that escaped than that it originated in a wet market.  ""oh, chinese people were eating weird shit; that's where this originated.""  what, they started eating 'weird shit' six weeks ago?  fuck outta here with that.  especially considering the government was arresting journalists (and apparently doctors) reporting it in the early weeks.

i won't say i think china intended this - i absolutely do not - but i do think their government knows WAY more than they're admitting... especially since they've been proving that all along.  and, you know, biolab in wuhan.

a 'handful' of cases and they quarantine tens of millions? 

this doesn't add up to a random virus that sprung up out of nowhere.

my guess is that it's working exactly as intended.  it just wasn't intended to work NOW.

(also, the terror of the chinese healthcare workers' texts and calls most definitely belies the horseshit numbers we're being fed.)"

The bottom line is, no one on here really knows what the fuck is gonna happen. It might spread across the country, it might stay as isolated cases. There are a ton of differences between china and the US that'll factor into whether or not it spreads, so who knows.

If you'd like a list, let me know.

ETA:  this was Dettols statement regarding the latest strain of Corona virus:  

""As this is an emerging outbreak RB, like all manufacturers, doesn’t yet have access to the new virus (2019-nCoV) for testing and, as a result, are not yet in a position to confirm levels of effectiveness against the new strain.

“Our products have been tested against other coronaviruses (such as MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV) and have been found to kill those.”

So, bottom line is there are no products that have been clinically proven to kill the 2019 novel Corona virus.  It would be impossible to obtain this evidence at this point.  The best we can do is use products proven effective against prior strains."

One disease in particular on a cruise ship where people are being quarantined exactly because of that ONE virus. You think that everyone is just strolling about the ship like usual? No, they are stuck in their rooms... it must be horrible, but it actually is a fairly good, if uncomfortable, experiment.

It is a good experiment for Case Fatality Rate (CFR) if we can trace all the positives to their endpoint, but a very poor experiment for R0, because a cruise ship is notorious for tight quarters spreading all forms of disease. Your standard norovirus is roughly 5x more likely to spread on a cruise ship.

People were transmitting the disease before the quarantine began so the idea that the quarantine gives you a true R0 is false in this case, also given not all the quarantined people are isolated and some are in close quarters; if one person was infected in a cabin of 2-3, you have guaranteed an infection for the others with how this quarantine is working."

I am not undermining the severity of this virus, but at the end of the day it is already occurring and there is nothing we, an individual of a country, can do other than raise awareness and practice hygiene. 

Having said that, most of us in this sub are incredibly lucky to be living in the country we do - with great health facilities, great doctors, etc. Our health system has not been overloaded with this virus at this point in time, unlike China. I don't mean to upset you, but I was just listening to a video on Twitter (unconfirmed sources) and the nurse/doctor/health professional rejected a son from bringing his already diagnosed father in. The man was devastated and this lady said: ""we can do nothing, there is already a lady who has been diagnosed and is 35 weeks pregnant and we can't admit her in"".

It would take a few hundred cases before things really started ramping up as it has in China. To my knowledge this virus was detected in Nov or December, and I believe on Jan 22nd there was 579 confirmed cases. If this thing really does explode it's going to take a few weeks before that starts to become a reality or not. Also with so few cases all the resources can be devoted to just a handful of people. Again if this starts ramping up in areas with large clusters there may be 1000's in need of medical assistance at which point it will be impossible for most to get the help they require meaning the the percentage of people who die will likely increase."

They are on the sales floor all day dealing directly with the public and probably not practicing good personal hygiene, i.e washing hands often and not touching face etc. (Not saying Walmart workers are dirty) Since nobody seems concerned about this in the least bit. All your food picked up at curbside will be infected. Your best bet is to go yourself, write a good list, grab items from the back of the shelf that weren't heavily handled and be in and out quick. Wipe down the shopping cart handle and wash/sanitize your hands before getting in your car. I'd much rather trust my own personal hygiene precautions than someone elses.

Edit: I would also start avoiding fresh produce. Everyone in the store has to touch and inspect every single apple or lettuce head before the find the perfect one."

Thing is, you're seeing a sample bias in how it affects other nationalities.

Almost 99.999% of infected are Chinese. Therefore it looks like Chinese get it worst. But at the same time, 99.999% of the people in China are Chinese.  Most westerners who were visiting there GTFO right away.. and I don't think Wuhan is a tourism destination.

And cases coming to Western nations right now are getting the absolute top A++ hospital treatment because it's 1 or 2 cases here or there.  So as soon as someone needs oxygen they're getting it. They're getting things like unapproved antivirals because hey, can't hurt right?

If a lot of cases occur here, standards of care will unfortunately be sacrificed in order to accomodate the load of patients. But I doubt it would reach the levels of Wuhan in terms of lethality just because they have more stuff stocked up here. At least I have hope.

All that being said, wearing a surgical mask may prevent you from touching your face but will not protect against airborne pathogens. An N95 mask can prevent 95% percent of airborne pathogens that are larger than 300 nm (0.3 microns) and is recommended for TB, measles, chicken pox, and even SARS (although as noted above, not sure how effective it would be). A HEPA filter blocks 99.97% of airborne pathogens that are larger than 300 nm. Wearing any of these can help protect against self-contamination and more than likely block some of the airborne pathogens you may be around. Only way to block 100% is to be in your own containment suit (haz-mat, etc).

Additionally, the N in N95 refers to NOT resistant to oil. If you have sweaty palms and touch the front of your mask (which you should never do), your mask is now contaminated on its surface possibly making it more porous to other pathogens as well as a potential breeding ground for them. Wear masks, change frequently if possible, and always wash your hands."

It's spreading like wildfire. 

Chinese communist party lied and delayed information to the world, including their own people, and are still lying and also not cooperating with other governments. 

Mortality rate is unknown because the country that has the most infections (China) has data that is too unreliable. They don't have enough testing kits and their healthcare system is collapsing. Safe to say though it's easily 2% or higher. 2% seems like a small number, but the flu is 0.1% mortality rate, so this is *significantly* worse. Given the extreme measures CCP is using to try and contain it, it's probable that it could be even higher than 2%.


It seems if you have access to quality healthcare your outcomes are better, the problem is obviously given how contagious this is, even the 'best' healthcare systems (in the west) will easily become overwhelmed.

There is a concerted effort from governments and media (public and private) to downplay the situation, to avoid mass panic. As bad as the situation is, it will be 10x worse once people start panic buying, profiteering, and overloading the hospital systems with unlikely cases, so they are trying to delay this as long as possible.
