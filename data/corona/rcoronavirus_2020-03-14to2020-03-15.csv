The teen suspect surrendered with his mother Friday and was charged with assault and aggravated harassment for kicking the 59-year-old victim to the ground earlier this week, police said.
The man was walking down Madison Ave. near E. 103rd St. when the teen kicked him from behind about 7:50 p.m. Monday and yelled “F--- you, Chinese coronavirus!” as the victim fell to the sidewalk, cops said.

The man suffered cuts to his knees and hands, but was otherwise uninjured, police said. Cops put out surveillance images of the suspect Thursday.

The teen is being charged as a juvenile. His name was not released because he is a minor, police said.
Meanwhile, cops in Queens are investigating another hate crime attack fueled by panic over the disease.

The 47-year-old Asian victim and his 10-year-old son were near the corner of 70th Ave. and Queens Blvd. in Elmhurst about 6:50 a.m. Thursday when a man wearing a camouflage coat and pants approached and asked why the dad wasn’t wearing a mask.

The suspect cursed at the victim then pushed his head before walking away. The victim was not harmed.

Thursday’s incident is the fourth attack against Asians to plague the city during the coronavirus crisis.
On Tuesday, a 23-year-old Asian woman was punched in the face in Midtown by another woman who demanded to know why she wasn’t wearing a mask.

On Mar. 4, an unhinged straphanger was caught on video spraying what looked like a bottle of Febreze at an Asian man on a Brooklyn train. No arrests have been made."

Originally I was going to write this as a response to a short thread between us talking about the reaction to SARS-COV 2 by the media and people in general compared to the 2009 H1N1 pandemic. He didnt seem to have an agenda and genuinely saw the events surrounding right now as simple overreaction, BUT it's clear there are many with political reasons to compare H1N1 and SARS COV 2 (will use COVID from here forward, I am aware COVID refers to the disease not the virus itself).  

Certain groups have attempted to downplay the clear mishandling of the COVID pandemic by comparing it to seasonal flu as well as the 2009 pandemic. Repeatedly people have pointed at the number of deaths caused by influenza to suggest that the reaction to COVID is ridiculously overblown. ""Up to 60,000 people have died from this flu season in the US alone"", ""no one attacked Obama as harshly/people didnt react as extremely even after H1N1 killed 12,000 people"". Such comments are often followed or preceded by pointing to the current case count and death toll of COVID. 

Now many people have already pointed out basic flaws with such arguments, the most obvious being it makes no sense to compare the deaths of seasonal flu OR H1N1 over the course of an entire year to the short time COVID has been spreading. 

BUT some people have said even taking that into consideration, people were not freaking out as much during the H1N1 pandemic as what has happened recently. 

Im not old enough to remember the reaction to H1N1, but yes it is probably correct to say that the reaction is more extreme. What little reading I could do I'll get use to write as close to a fair comparison solely from a media perspective. I'll be comparing case totals from 1st confirmed case of swine flu to as close to 54 days after that first confirmed case. I chose 54 days as it's the number of days it has been since the first confirmed case of COVID was reported. To have more data samples, I'm counting 54 days from first cases confirmed in Italy and South Korea as well; this is to have a better picture of the spread given the lack of testing in the US as well as getting an idea of what COVID could become based on the difference in response between South Korea and Italy. I'm not including China due to the lack of reliable info on the early spread of COVID. 

The CDC confirmed the first case of swine flu H1N1 on April 17, 2009 (CDC). There were 3000 cases of H1N1 confirmed and 3 deaths on May 12, 2009, 25 days after the first confirmed case (Univ. Of MN). By June 2, 2009 there were at least 17000 cases confirmed and over 100 dead worldwide, 46 days after the first confirmed case (Reuters). By June 10, the WHO reported 26563 cases worldwide, and 140 dead, 52 days after the first confirmed case (TIME).

The first confirmed case of SARS COV 2 in the US was on Jan 20, 2020 (New England Journal of Medicine). As of March 14 2020 theres been 2170 cases confirmed and 48 deaths in the US alone, 54 days after the first confirmed case in the US (New York Times).

The first two confirmed cases of COVID in Italy were on Jan 31, 2020. On Feb 22, 2020 the first death from COVID occurred, 22 days after the first confirmed case. (Corrier della Serra) As of today, 17660 cases have been confirmed and 1266 deaths, (Aljazeera), 42 days since the first confirmed case of COVID in Italy. 

The first case of COVID in Korea was confirmed on Jan 24, 2020. As of March 11 2020 there were 7800 cases confirmed and 61 deaths, 46 days from the first confirmed case. (Wikipedia).

To me it makes sense that there is a more extreme reaction to COVID than there was with H1N1. Now again I do fully understand the point that many people are overreacting, but closing of schools etc isn't an overreaction, its proper action. 

Children can be carriers and especially in a school environment multipliers. Children aren't high risk, but that's not why schools are being closed. It's to prevent the spread to people significantly more vulnerable. 

Beating people with wine bottles is overreaction.
Stocking up on enough toilet paper for an elephant is overreaction. 
Closing schools and postponing events isnt.

No, it's not the end of the world. But people need to seriously stop with this ""it's just a flu, it's just a cold mutation"" bullshit as you are factually incorrect.

1. Incubation period of 2-14 days, people can unknowingly spread it for days
2. Infection rate higher than the flu but difficult to see due to asymptomatic carriers and long incubation period
3. Initial symptoms make it difficult to differentiate between many different ailments
4. The symptoms largely affect older individuals with health problems sparing the young while using them as vectors to reach distant locations
5. Mortality rate is low enough, that fear of death only impacts a small number of individuals

We have thirteen healers, this is very good information - said on Saturday the Chief Sanitary Inspector Jarosław Pinkas during a press conference about the coronavirus and the epidemic threat introduced in Poland on Friday. The number of coronavirus-infected cases diagnosed in Poland is 103, of which three have died.

\- We will have better results because we can consolidate. We have really dedicated doctors and nurses. Our services are more and more efficient because they are more and more experienced. This is a new challenge - Pinkas emphasized.

The Chief Sanitary Inspector emphasized that ""true cure for coronavirus is"" responsibility, prudence and reasonableness "". He also noted that the introduction of an epidemic threat is an action adequate to the current situation. - We're doing what we should do. We set the direction of what to do to ensure a sense of health security for all citizens - he added, adding that other countries will follow the footsteps of Poland.

The number of diagnosed is consistent with the estimates

""We estimated that by the end of the week we would have about 100 infections,"" said Pinkas. The number of infected in Poland made public on Saturday is 103 cases."

One student spent six periods crying in a department office out of concern that she would spread the virus to her grandmother living with cancer.

For instance, if you count the number of dead over the number dead+recovered we are sitting at a 7.2% CFR. However, there are a lot of unknowns at play here. If we assume that the number of cases (150K+) is actually double and the other 150K never experienced symptoms then we could be sitting at a 2.5%. But perhaps we missed deaths, especially early, referring to them as deaths from pneumonia. If we missed 25% of the deaths to date then it could be a 3.1% CFR. 

&#x200B;

In the end there are so many variables at play. For instance we still only have rough estimates on H1N1 of the number of people who were infected and who died. What we do know is that even in the most drastic of scenarios where you assume only 10% of cases worldwide have been reported you are sitting at a 0.4% CFR. If we get as many cases of COVID-19 as we did H1N1 then the world could see over 5 million deaths worldwide vs 200K from H1N1 and 10 times higher than the seasonal flu. That is on the super optimistic low end of the CFR which is why we need to do everything we can to avoid the infected numbers of H1N1 or the Influenza."

2020-03-14,miamiherald,Coronavirus,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/fim7k1/coronavirus_testing_wont_count_against_immigrants/fkhy3g2/,"From immigration reporter [Monique O. Madan](https://twitter.com/MoniqueOMadan):

When immigration officials rolled out their [“public charge” rule last month](https://www.miamiherald.com/news/local/immigration/article240486616.html), people who were sick were deemed a “burden” to the U.S. and their health conditions were counted against them when applying for a green card.

Late Friday, however, part of that changed— at least when it comes to coronavirus, [United States Citizenship and Immigration Services announced](https://www.uscis.gov/greencard/public-charge). Any immigrant who gets tested or treated for the virus will not be negatively impacted.

“USCIS encourages all those, including aliens, with symptoms that resemble coronavirus (COVID-19) (fever, cough, shortness of breath) to seek necessary medical treatment or preventive services,” [the agency said in a statement](https://www.uscis.gov/greencard/public-charge). “Such treatment or preventive services will not negatively affect any alien as part of a future public charge analysis.”

The agency continued: “To address the possibility that some aliens impacted by COVID-19 may be hesitant to seek necessary medical treatment or preventive services, USCIS will neither consider testing, treatment, nor preventative care (including vaccines, if a vaccine becomes available) related to COVID-19 as part of a public charge inadmissibility determination, nor as related to the public benefit condition applicable to certain nonimmigrants seeking an extension of stay or change of status, even if such treatment is provided or paid for by one or more public benefits, as defined in the rule (e.g. federally funded Medicaid).”

[Fear among immigrant communities](https://www.miamiherald.com/news/local/immigration/article240805776.html) nationwide to get tested for the virus if symptoms developed has been rampant, advocates say. People in line for green card considerations have worried that if contracting the virus and seeking treatment for it would impact their chances of getting their permanent residency in the U.S."

2020-03-14,RedJohnIsBacc,Coronavirus,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/fim5ls/the_power_of_exponential_growth_explained_how/fkhxyom/," 

In early December, Britta Jewell, an infectious disease epidemiologist at the MRC Centre for Global Infectious Disease Analysis, Imperial College London, began researching some of the novel respiratory viruses that were then circulating.

Before long, she and her father, Nick Jewell — also an infectious disease epidemiological statistician, at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine — were in constant conversation about Covid-19. He was in bed, recovering from something like a severe flu. (He had tested flu-negative, which was unusual — and what motivated her research.) They talked over email and WhatsApp and the phone about the grim situation evolving in Wuhan, China, where the virus originated.

“In mid- to late January we started developing a plan for our family in case one of us became infected, and preparing supplies for two weeks of isolation,” she said. They also started calculating the numbers and sharing frustrations over their inability to convey to people the seriousness of the coronavirus’s exponential spread.

“We were listening to people, such as President Trump, saying, ‘What’s the fuss, it’s just like the flu,’ and ‘There are only 15 cases, and only one death in the U.S., much fewer than everywhere else, we’re doing great,’” Dr. Nick Jewell said. “But every epidemiologist knew what was coming inexorably toward us.”

On Tuesday, they noticed a [tweet by Mike Baker](https://twitter.com/bymikebaker/status/1237588549362278400?s=12) of The New York Times, in which he noted the cumulative number of coronavirus cases in the U.S. by date:

Jan. 14 — 0

Jan. 21 — 1

Jan. 28 — 5

Feb. 4 — 11

Feb. 11 — 14

Feb. 18 — 25

Feb. 25 — 59

Mar. 3 — 125

Mar. 10 — 1,004

“That is exponential growth,” Dr. Nick Jewell said. (He noted that the latest increase was also likely a reflection of increased testing.)

“We started discussing what actions to take in the face of exponential growth,” he said. “Obviously, we need to slow the rate of growth ([flatten the curve](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/11/science/coronavirus-curve-mitigation-infection.html)) through government and individual responses — effectively based on increased testing and heightened social distancing. But in order to accomplish that, we first need to convince people to take this outbreak seriously, which is no small task. It’s as if humans can only think linearly. But for epidemic modelers, exponential growth is the very nature of the beast.”

Dr. Britta Jewell wondered whether the power of exponential growth could be turned to a collective advantage. “The answer was yes, but only if we intervene early,” she said. “That means now.”

The exponential effect was now on other minds as well. Yaneer Bar-Yam, a physicist and systems scientist and the founding president of the New England Complex Systems Institute, convened a YouTube chat with Nassim Nicholas Taleb, a probability flâneur and risk analyst, to discuss “[Why It’s Better to Panic Early](https://www.youtube.com/watch?reload=9&v=e2Kga5HeAqk),” following up on [a paper](https://necsi.edu/systemic-risk-of-pandemic-via-novel-pathogens-coronavirus-a-note) they put out in late January. And on Tuesday, Tomas Pueyo, a Silicon Valley entrepreneur, posted what amounted to a lengthy white paper on Medium titled, “[Coronavirus: Why You Must Act Now](https://medium.com/@tomaspueyo/coronavirus-act-today-or-people-will-die-f4d3d9cd99ca),” which has been viewed 18 million times already.

“The graph that really grabbed my attention was the one showing a model of daily new cases of Covid-19 with social-distancing measures starting just one day apart,” Dr. Britta Jewell said. “It only takes a one-day difference in action to see a 40 percent reduction in cases — that’s enormous. It really conveys the urgency of the situation.”"

Many people ignored the danger of these markets. But these improvements cannot be achieved in one day: they need those consumers to change their habit; they need the whole society to form a strong opposition; and then the government should put more resources into policy implementation.

Even after this disaster, I would say it is difficult to 100% banning these businesses. A similar case is drug dealing. The good thing is the society seems to realise its danger and more strict policies have been made.  I do not know any consumers personally, so I do not know if they are charging.

Another example just come to my mind. If un-protected sex are banned, we will reduce the spread of AIDS greatly. That is right, but not easy to do, and I won't assume that it should be done quickly enough."

Likewise, if you were to study the number of infected and look at how long they have been infected for, half of them would be very recent admissions with a long way to go in their care cycle.

I am not a behavioral economist, psychologist, or anything related, but I would imagine that it is because people just naturally make more daily decisions based on raw totals, and not exponential rates of growth. So while the growth rate may be constant people wouldn't conclude that something growing exponentially is growing rapidly until the raw total growth hits a certain point."

[It is commonly assumed that the social contract is tenuous at best and that major natural disasters and other crises trigger mass disruption, disorder, and social breakdown. While there were well-documented instances of brutal hijacking, rioting, and looting in New Orleans after the deep flooding caused by the hurricane, there were many more reports of altruism, cooperativeness, and camaraderie among the affected population.The overall cooperative, prosocial, and altruistic individual and community response following Hurricane Katrina was similarly observed after the Asian tsunami of December 2004, and the July 7, 2005, terrorist bombings in London, and may have been reflected in the transient 40% to 60% drop in the homicide rate in New York City after September 11, 2001. In support of de Goyet's thesis, it is well documented that natural and man-made disasters are followed by increases in altruistic behavior and social solidarity.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2496928/)

[Following Hurricane Katrina, many residents of Baton Rouge, for example, invited someone to stay in their home; hotels housed displaced families, extended families, and pets; and nearly every large shelter created a clinic run by local doctors and nurses.9 At New Orleans' Charity Hospital (the Medical Center of Louisiana), people of different races, old and young, patients and providers, both rich and poor, held hands and prayed for rescue. Notwithstanding the chaos and confusion, the medical staff remained calm and communicated coherently, dispensing care and comfort. A flashlight-illuminated talent show was held in which everyone was invited to participate, including patients with masks donned to prevent the spread of tuberculosis.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2496928/)"
