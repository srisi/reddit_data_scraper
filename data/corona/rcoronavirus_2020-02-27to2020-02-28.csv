2020-02-27,milkybread,Coronavirus,96,https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/faifsg/i_have_read_everything_from_this_is_apocalyptic/fiyaqbl/,"Far more dangerous than the flu. From /u/Hafomeng


The virulence (R0) of SARS-CoV-2 is estimated between 1.4-6.49, with a mean estimate of 3.28[[1](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/coronavirus-may-spread-faster-than-who-estimate#Higher-estimates-than-WHO-predict)] . This mean estimate is much higher than the seasonal flu, which has an R0 of 1.3[[2](https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2020/01/how-fast-and-far-will-new-coronavirus-spread/605632/)] . What this means is that SARS-CoV-2 spreads signficantly faster than the seasonal flu. 

 1. The Case Fatality Rate (CFR) of SARS-CoV-2 is at least 2-3%[[3](https://academic.oup.com/ajcp/advance-article/doi/10.1093/ajcp/aqaa029/5735509)] . This is 20-30 times higher than the CFR of the season flu, which is around .1%[[4](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/02/03/the-flu-has-already-killed-10000-across-us-as-world-frets-over-coronavirus.html)] . 

 2. SARS-CoV-2 can be transmitted without the infected showing any symptoms[[5](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2762028)] . This makes it much more difficult to control. 

 3. Roughly 20% of SARS-CoV-2 infections result in serious symptoms that require medical intervention[[6](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/coronavirus-81-of-cases-are-mild-study-says#80.9%-of-the-cases-are-mild)] . This is more than 10 times the hospitalization rate of the seasonal flu[[7](https://www.cdc.gov/flu/about/burden/index.html)].

 4. Symptoms from SARS-CoV-2 can persist over a month[[8](https://www.thelancet.com/pb-assets/Lancet/pdfs/S2213260020300795.pdf)] compared to the seasonal flu where symptoms typically tend to clear after 5 days[[9](https://www.emedicinehealth.com/flu_in_adults/article_em.htm)] .

 5. There is no vaccine for SARS-CoV-2[[10](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/about/prevention-treatment.html)] whereas people regularly get annual flu shots. 

 6. There is no [herd immunity](https://www.ovg.ox.ac.uk/news/herd-immunity-how-does-it-work) for SARS-CoV-2 which means that it can theoretically infect the entire population. See, for example, a [Korean psychiatric department where the virus infected 99/102 people](https://twitter.com/covid_19news/status/1231581727438467072?s=21). 

Now, consider the multiplicative effect that all of these attributes have for the virus. Compared to the seasonal flu, SARS-CoV-2 (1) spreads faster; (2) kills far more; (3) is harder to control; (4) requires use of far more medical resources; (5) for far longer a period of time; (6) has no effective treatment; and (7) can infect entire populations. 

These factors mean that SARS-CoV-2, if left unchecked, is far more likely to overwhelm a country's medical infrastructure. Additionally, when medical infrastructure is overwhelmed, the CFR will skyrocket because we know that 20% of cases require medical intervention. 

This virus is potentially devastating if containment measures fail. Far worse than the seasonal flu."

• will get fired if they try to take sick leave

***Edit*** 

• also, many people cannot afford healthcare, and with tests costing over $1000 *with insurance*, many who think they're infected will forgo testing.

• Without a confirmed COVID-19 lab test, employers / landlords will be far less forgiving."

The workers did not show symptoms of infection and were not tested for the virus, according to lawyers for the whistleblower, who is a senior HHS official based in Washington who oversees workers at the Administration for Children and Families, a unit within HHS.
The whistleblower is seeking federal protection because she alleges she was unfairly and improperly reassigned after raising concerns about the safety of these workers to HHS officials, including those within the office of Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar. She was told Feb. 19 that if she does not accept the new position in 15 days, which is March 5, she would be terminated.

I'm in Korea and things are starting to look dicey over here. It went from normal everyday life to everything getting canceled better not leave your house reeaaal quick. It was over maybe a 48 hour span that things started getting serious. If you are not prepared before that panic phase hits you will be out in public scrambling for supplies in crowds of people, and they are likely panicking because there are numerous infected people confirmed in the local area... not the best situation to be shopping in. 

The reason this sub is talking doom and gloom is because some of us are actually living in the middle of outbreak areas and are experiencing this first hand. To be honest I'm not that afraid of getting infected. I am afraid of supply chain disruptions and not being able to buy basic food and supplies for my kids. The impact on the supply chain is a delayed effect. The biggest export here in Korea is cars, several major manufacturers have already had to completely shut down manufacturing due to supply shortages from China. On top of that our biggest port city Busan is getting slammed with infections and will likely see spreading shutdowns as well soon. 

If you don't think this will have massive global economic impact you simply aren't paying attention. That being said it isn't all doom and gloom, I can still go to the local grocery store and buy plenty of food for now. People have mostly been panic buying masks, hand sanitizer, and disinfectant wipes. It's not like the whole infrastructure will collapse overnight... there's no need for hysteria. But things could get pretty bad. Each population and government will react differently, but obviously it's much better to be prepared now. The threat is real.

The CDC is working closely with President Trump. A group of experts from the CDC are briefing him and part of his team.

Here are a couple on stage with Trump who appeared with him and are part of his team of experts:


Robert Ray Redfield Jr.[1] (born July 10, 1951) is an American virologist. 

He is the current Director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and the current Administrator of the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry... 

Before joining CDC, he was a tenured professor of medicine and microbiology at University of Maryland, Baltimore, chief of infectious disease, vice chair of medicine and a co-founder and associate director of the Institute of Human Virology (IHV) at the University of Maryland School of Medicine.[4] Dr. Redfield is known for his pioneering contributions in clinical research, and in particular for his extensive research into the virology and therapeutic treatments of HIV infection and AIDS. 

Anne Schuchat (born 1960) is an American medical doctor who serves as the Principal Deputy Director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)... She is an Assistant Surgeon General holding the rank of rear admiral in the United States Public Health Service Commissioned Corps. Having worked with the CDC on immunization, respiratory, and other infectious diseases since 1988, she served as the Interim Deputy Director for Science and Public Health at the CDC from February 2009 to June 2009. She has also held other posts in the CDC.... During the 2001 anthrax attacks, Schuchat served on CDC's Anthrax Emergency Response Team, which was tasked with investigating the attacks.[1]

(note: The CDC has gotten billions of dollars for emergency preparation and has 15,000 employees/contractors.)"

2020-02-27,Taellion,Coronavirus,14,https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/fa7lu2/need_help_explaining_why_this_is_more_serious/fiwezbk/,"The virulence (R0) of SARS-CoV-2 is estimated between 1.4-6.49, with a mean estimate of 3.28[[1](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/coronavirus-may-spread-faster-than-who-estimate#Higher-estimates-than-WHO-predict)] . This mean estimate is much higher than the seasonal flu, which has an R0 of 1.3[[2](https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2020/01/how-fast-and-far-will-new-coronavirus-spread/605632/)] . What this means is that SARS-CoV-2 spreads signficantly faster than the seasonal flu. 

 1. The Case Fatality Rate (CFR) of SARS-CoV-2 is at least 2-3%[[3](https://academic.oup.com/ajcp/advance-article/doi/10.1093/ajcp/aqaa029/5735509)] . This is 20-30 times higher than the CFR of the season flu, which is around .1%[[4](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/02/03/the-flu-has-already-killed-10000-across-us-as-world-frets-over-coronavirus.html)] . 

 2. SARS-CoV-2 can be transmitted without the infected showing any symptoms[[5](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2762028)] . This makes it much more difficult to control. 

 3. Roughly 20% of SARS-CoV-2 infections result in serious symptoms that require medical intervention[[6](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/coronavirus-81-of-cases-are-mild-study-says#80.9%-of-the-cases-are-mild)] . This is more than 10 times the hospitalization rate of the seasonal flu[[7](https://www.cdc.gov/flu/about/burden/index.html)].

 4. Symptoms from SARS-CoV-2 can persist over a month[[8](https://www.thelancet.com/pb-assets/Lancet/pdfs/S2213260020300795.pdf)] compared to the seasonal flu where symptoms typically tend to clear after 5 days[[9](https://www.emedicinehealth.com/flu_in_adults/article_em.htm)] .

 5. There is no vaccine for SARS-CoV-2[[10](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/about/prevention-treatment.html)] whereas people regularly get annual flu shots. 

 6. There is no [herd immunity](https://www.ovg.ox.ac.uk/news/herd-immunity-how-does-it-work) for SARS-CoV-2 which means that it can theoretically infect the entire population. See, for example, a [Korean psychiatric department where the virus infected 99/102 people](https://twitter.com/covid_19news/status/1231581727438467072?s=21). 

Now, consider the multiplicative effect that all of these attributes have for the virus. Compared to the seasonal flu, SARS-CoV-2 (1) spreads faster; (2) kills far more; (3) is harder to control; (4) requires use of far more medical resources; (5) for far longer a period of time; (6) has no effective treatment; and (7) can infect entire populations. 

These factors mean that SARS-CoV-2, if left unchecked, is far more likely to overwhelm a country's medical infrastructure. Additionally, when medical infrastructure is overwhelmed, the CFR will skyrocket because we know that 20% of cases require medical intervention. 

This virus is potentially devastating if containment measures fail. Far worse than the seasonal flu.

Short answer -- we do not know. Data is messy.

Consider the SARS example. Final reported death rate out of China was around 6%, lower compared to something like 9.6% rate reported in other regions of the world. We will never know the true rates experienced or be able to verify, data is messy.

No intent to single out China. All countries face limitations of manufacture of test kits, actual testing of all infected, and time spent processing those kits. Reliability of the test, some things may be harder than others to test for, you've got false positives or false negatives. From perspective of centralized government the incentives differ from outside that body.

With flu we have had a very long time to study the virus and slowly over time improve our data.

Accurate numbers will require careful collection of data with tests designed to minimize bias. Aggregating experience from numerous countries will help zero in on the actual parameters of COVID-19. That takes time."

While still serious, it also means nature is taking it’s course and all rules apply, as they do to other viruses, the easier the spread the lower the mortality rate (generally) and a Hollywood style pandemic of a very infectious disease with an Ebola mortality rate is not possible.

That being said, 2% (which experts seem to hope is exaggerated, but as for now we don’t have proof) is bad. The Spanish Flu had such a rate. Sure, the healthcare was waaaay worse back then, but still not something to ignore."

2020-02-27,Jesenjin,Coronavirus,11,https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/faj5r7/us_workers_without_protective_gear_assisted/fiyg0oz/,"Asked whether any protocols may have been broken, given the urgency on the ground, Azar replied that urgency was never a reason for breaking safety protocols.

“I don’t believe that has taken place,” Azar said said, adding that health and safety protocols “should always be followed.” He said that he did not personally know the names of the team, but that other department officials did. Pressed by Gomez what the department would do if untrained employees were exposed to the virus, Azar said: “I’d want to know the full facts, and we’d take appropriate remedial efforts.”

The whistleblower said she received an email Jan. 25 about a potential deployment within ACF to support repatriation of the evacuated Americans, according to her lawyer. She initially supported the efforts because they had the “appearance that this was within ACF’s scope,” lawyer Lauren Naylor said. But later, she discovered the personnel were dispatched without her knowledge by other senior officials at HHS. It was part of the agency’s “all-hands-on-deck” mission, Naylor said, but it broke agency protocol about what kinds of employees should respond to health emergencies. The whistleblower said she later found out about the deployment when she heard directly from some employees and other senior officials at HHS.

Some workers [expressed concern about the lack of protective gear](https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/shortages-confusion-and-poor-communication-complicate-coronavirus-preparations/2020/02/25/d9e56396-575d-11ea-9b35-def5a027d470_story.html?tid=lk_inline_manual_33&itid=lk_inline_manual_33) to the ACF team leader on the ground. That person joined ACF in September and had “no training or experience in any federal emergency management, public health emergency response, or safety or operational protocols to run the mission,” the complaint states.

ACF personnel typically deal with supporting people recovering from natural disasters, such as floods and fires, and helping victims apply for temporary assistance, all of which are under the category of human services, the whistleblower’s lawyers said. HHS officials broke established protocols for emergency support by sending ACF workers to a health emergency, for which they have no training, Naylor said. The Administration for Children and Families, which has about 1,300 employees, [has come under attack in recent years because of its role in sheltering and taking custody of migrant children](https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/immigration/ig-trump-administration-took-thousands-more-migrant-children-from-parents/2019/01/17/c05f51e6-19c6-11e9-8813-cb9dec761e73_story.html?tid=lk_inline_manual_34&itid=lk_inline_manual_34) who crossed the U.S.-Mexico border who were separated from them by the Department of Homeland Security.

The workers’ concerns were not addressed, the whistleblower’s lawyers said.

“She was involuntarily assigned to a position in a subject matter where she has no expertise,” said Wilkenfeld, her lawyer, in an interview Thursday. The agency said the reason for the reassignment was “necessary to meet the needs of the department,” according to a memo she received. “If I did not accept involuntary reassignment, I would be terminated from federal service through adverse personnel action,” according to her complaint.

Officials at the Department of Health and Human Services sent more than a dozen workers to [receive the first Americans evacuated from Wuhan, China, the epicenter of the coronavirus outbreak,](https://www.washingtonpost.com/video/world/plane-arrives-in-california-from-wuhan/2020/01/29/b20abf1a-c7a0-481d-8adf-db7141b1fae6_video.html?tid=lk_inline_manual_2&itid=lk_inline_manual_2) without proper training for infection control or appropriate protective gear, according to a whistleblower complaint.

The workers did not show symptoms of infection and were not [tested for the virus,](https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2020/02/25/cdc-coronavirus-test/?tid=lk_inline_manual_3&itid=lk_inline_manual_3) according to lawyers for the whistleblower, who is a senior HHS official based in Washington who oversees workers at the Administration for Children and Families, a unit within HHS.

The whistleblower is seeking federal protection because she alleges she was unfairly and improperly reassigned after raising concerns about the safety of these workers to HHS officials, including those within the office of Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar. She was told Feb. 19 that if she does not accept the new position in 15 days, which is March 5, she would be terminated.

The whistleblower has decades of experience in the field, received two HHS department awards from Azar last year, and has received the highest performance evaluations, her lawyers said.

The complaint was filed Wednesday with the Office of the Special Counsel, an independent federal watchdog agency. The whistleblower’s lawyers provided a copy of a redacted 24-page complaint to The Washington Post. A spokesman for the Office of the Special Counsel said he could not comment on complaints filed with the office.

The complaint alleges that HHS staff were “improperly deployed” and were “not properly trained or equipped to operate in a public health emergency situation.” The complaint also alleges that the workers were [potentially exposed to coronavirus](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/asia_pacific/coronavirus-china-updates/2020/02/22/72dd19de-54ea-11ea-b119-4faabac6674f_story.html?tid=lk_inline_manual_9&itid=lk_inline_manual_9) because appropriate steps were not taken to protect them, and staff were not trained in wearing personal protective equipment, even though they had face-to-face contact with returning passengers. The workers were in contact with passengers in an airplane hangar where evacuees were received and on two other occasions: when they helped distribute keys for room assignments and hand out colored ribbons for identification purposes.

“We take all whistleblower complaints very seriously and are providing the complainant all appropriate protections under the Whistleblower Protection Act. We are evaluating the complaint and have nothing further to add at this time,” HHS spokeswoman Caitlin Oakley said.

In her complaint, the whistleblower states that “appropriate steps were not taken to quarantine, monitor, or test \[the workers\] during their deployment and upon their return home.” The repatriated Americans were [among those evacuated](https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/coronavirus-diamond-princess-cruise-americans/2020/02/20/b6f54cae-5279-11ea-b119-4faabac6674f_story.html?tid=lk_inline_manual_13&itid=lk_inline_manual_13) from Wuhan and [quarantined on military bases in California and Texas](https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/for-americans-a-nightmare-escaping-wuhan-then-14-days-of-quarantine/2020/02/05/d303daca-4859-11ea-8124-0ca81effcdfb_story.html?tid=lk_inline_manual_13&itid=lk_inline_manual_13) because they were considered at high risk for contracting the flu-like illness.

About 14 ACF personnel were sent to March Air Force base in Riverside County, California, and another team of about 13 ACF personnel were sent to Travis Air Force in Fairfield, California, according to the complaint and the whistleblower’s lawyer, Ari Wilkenfeld. Several people within HHS voiced objection to sending the ACF personnel to receive passengers, according to a person familiar with the conversations, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss private deliberations.

A second person familiar with the situation said the workers were not tested for coronavirus because none of them met the criteria for testing, which only calls for testing people who had recent travel to China or contact with a confirmed case. The workers also did not exhibit any symptoms, the person said. If they had, appropriate protocol would have been followed.

The deployments took place Jan. 28 to 31, around the time when the first planeload of evacuees arrived at March, and Feb. 2 to Feb. 7, during the time when additional flights were arriving at Travis. The planes each carried about 200 Americans who were repatriated from Wuhan.

After their deployments, the workers returned to their normal duties, some taking commercial airline flights to return to their offices around the country, the lawyers said.

“Our client was concerned that ACF staff — who were potentially exposed to the coronavirus — were allowed to leave quarantined areas and return to their communities, where they may have spread the coronavirus to others,” said Lauren Naylor, one of the whistleblower’s lawyers.

The whistleblower is also seeking assistance from the office of Rep. Jimmy Gomez, (D-Ca.), a member of the House Ways and Means committee and vice chair of the House Oversight Committee, according to a Gomez spokesman.

During a hearing Thursday, Gomez asked Azar whether any employees from the Administration for Children and Families could have been sent to help with the repatriation of Americans from Wuhan, China without any training in emergency response. Azar replied that some ACF employees were involved.

Asked what sort of health and safety training the personnel received, and whether any of them were exposed to high-risk evacuees from China, Azar said: “They never should have been without P.P.E,” referring to personal protective equipment.

An economic crisis was in the making for a long time, could have been a failing bank in Europe or something else."

More comparable to SARS, but SARS never got out of hand. SARS was also more in that scary ebola category. Like you really don't want to get this and it's far away for the most part.

This is not as dangerous and scary for the individual, but for society this is completely different as we're seeing an uncontained pandemic unfold with potentially enormous consequences and we're not able to control it. We have to take the pain. That is new. Few alive have been in a similar situation. Maybe  comparable to hong kong flu and asian flu but those weren't quite as dangerous.

People saying this is just like SARS, Ebola and swine flu are just wrong. Though swine flu probably comes closest as that one was also uncontained, but no where near as dangerous."

1. The virulence (R0) of SARS-CoV-2 is estimated between 1.4-6.49, with a mean estimate of 3.28\[[1](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/coronavirus-may-spread-faster-than-who-estimate#Higher-estimates-than-WHO-predict)\] . This mean estimate is much higher than the seasonal flu, which has an R0 of 1.3\[[2](https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2020/01/how-fast-and-far-will-new-coronavirus-spread/605632/)\] . What this means is that SARS-CoV-2 spreads signficantly faster than the seasonal flu.
2. The Case Fatality Rate (CFR) of SARS-CoV-2 is at least 2-3%\[[3](https://academic.oup.com/ajcp/advance-article/doi/10.1093/ajcp/aqaa029/5735509)\] . This is 20-30 times higher than the CFR of the season flu, which is around .1%\[[4](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/02/03/the-flu-has-already-killed-10000-across-us-as-world-frets-over-coronavirus.html)\] .
3. SARS-CoV-2 can be transmitted without the infected showing any symptoms\[[5](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2762028)\] . This makes it much more difficult to control.
4. Roughly 20% of SARS-CoV-2 infections result in serious symptoms that require medical intervention\[[6](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/coronavirus-81-of-cases-are-mild-study-says#80.9%-of-the-cases-are-mild)\] . This is more than 10 times the hospitalization rate of the seasonal flu\[[7](https://www.cdc.gov/flu/about/burden/index.html)\].
5. Symptoms from SARS-CoV-2 can persist over a month\[[8](https://www.thelancet.com/pb-assets/Lancet/pdfs/S2213260020300795.pdf)\] compared to the seasonal flu where symptoms typically tend to clear after 5 days\[[9](https://www.emedicinehealth.com/flu_in_adults/article_em.htm)\] .
6. There is no vaccine for SARS-CoV-2\[[10](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/about/prevention-treatment.html)\] whereas people regularly get annual flu shots.
7. There is no [herd immunity](https://www.ovg.ox.ac.uk/news/herd-immunity-how-does-it-work) for SARS-CoV-2 which means that it can theoretically infect the entire population. *See*, for example, a [Korean psychiatric department where the virus infected 99/102 people](https://twitter.com/covid_19news/status/1231581727438467072?s=21).

Now, consider the multiplicative effect that all of these attributes have for the virus. Compared to the seasonal flu, SARS-CoV-2 (1) spreads faster; (2) kills far more; (3) is harder to control; (4) requires use of far more medical resources; (5) for far longer a period of time; (6) has no effective treatment; and (7) can infect entire populations.

These factors mean that SARS-CoV-2, if left unchecked, is far more likely to overwhelm a country's medical infrastructure. Additionally, when medical infrastructure is overwhelmed, the CFR will skyrocket because we know that 20% of cases require medical intervention."

The virulence (R0) of SARS-CoV-2 is estimated between 1.4-6.49, with a mean estimate of 3.28[[1](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/coronavirus-may-spread-faster-than-who-estimate#Higher-estimates-than-WHO-predict)] . This mean estimate is much higher than the seasonal flu, which has an R0 of 1.3[[2](https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2020/01/how-fast-and-far-will-new-coronavirus-spread/605632/)] . What this means is that SARS-CoV-2 spreads signficantly faster than the seasonal flu. 

 1. The Case Fatality Rate (CFR) of SARS-CoV-2 is at least 2-3%[[3](https://academic.oup.com/ajcp/advance-article/doi/10.1093/ajcp/aqaa029/5735509)] . This is 20-30 times higher than the CFR of the season flu, which is around .1%[[4](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/02/03/the-flu-has-already-killed-10000-across-us-as-world-frets-over-coronavirus.html)] . 

 2. SARS-CoV-2 can be transmitted without the infected showing any symptoms[[5](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2762028)] . This makes it much more difficult to control. 

 3. Roughly 20% of SARS-CoV-2 infections result in serious symptoms that require medical intervention[[6](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/coronavirus-81-of-cases-are-mild-study-says#80.9%-of-the-cases-are-mild)] . This is more than 10 times the hospitalization rate of the seasonal flu[[7](https://www.cdc.gov/flu/about/burden/index.html)].

 4. Symptoms from SARS-CoV-2 can persist over a month[[8](https://www.thelancet.com/pb-assets/Lancet/pdfs/S2213260020300795.pdf)] compared to the seasonal flu where symptoms typically tend to clear after 5 days[[9](https://www.emedicinehealth.com/flu_in_adults/article_em.htm)] .

 5. There is no vaccine for SARS-CoV-2[[10](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/about/prevention-treatment.html)] whereas people regularly get annual flu shots. 

 6. There is no [herd immunity](https://www.ovg.ox.ac.uk/news/herd-immunity-how-does-it-work) for SARS-CoV-2 which means that it can theoretically infect the entire population. See, for example, a [Korean psychiatric department where the virus infected 99/102 people](https://twitter.com/covid_19news/status/1231581727438467072?s=21). 

Now, consider the multiplicative effect that all of these attributes have for the virus. Compared to the seasonal flu, SARS-CoV-2 (1) spreads faster; (2) kills far more; (3) is harder to control; (4) requires use of far more medical resources; (5) for far longer a period of time; (6) has no effective treatment; and (7) can infect entire populations. 

These factors mean that SARS-CoV-2, if left unchecked, is far more likely to overwhelm a country's medical infrastructure. Additionally, when medical infrastructure is overwhelmed, the CFR will skyrocket because we know that 20% of cases require medical intervention. 

This virus is potentially devastating if containment measures fail. Far worse than the seasonal flu.

I assume it is both. 

But regardless of how forthcoming China may be with the real numbers of infected, their central government is very stable and can take drastic measures (like they did in Hubei) without fear of rebellion/revolution. 

Iran is much less stable and with the US trying to enact regime change, I assume their government is very scared of taking any action besides lying about the numbers of infected and threatening doctors and journalists to keep their mouths shut. So yes, I do believe the people of Iran are in a much more dangerous situation than the Chinese people."
