For those in countries who deal with health care in a humane fashion: 

In the US you usually have a copay, or a portion of a particular expense you're responsible for. So, for example, if you have a 20% copay on a $4,000 Coronavirus test, you owe $800. 

The problem is, you also have something called a deductible, which is an amount of money you must pay out of pocket in a given year before -any- insurance benefits kick in. 

As such, if I have a $5,000 deductible (which is lower than common), if I recieve a $4,000 Coronavirus test, I pay all $4,000. ""Copay"" only kicks in once I've paid my whole annual deductible."

Why? 1) The virus can be very mild like a cold or flu in probably the vast majority of young people, 2) Because it is relatively mild, people don't bother to seek medical care (how often do people go to the doctor even with the flu? healthcare is expensive), 3) At least as of last week, testing has only been offered at the hospital for people who have recently traveled to one of the CDC Level 3 countries (what about community spread?)

Personally, I've already had the flu and a common cold this season for a cumulative total of 3 weeks. But about 2.5 weeks ago, I had a fever for a few days. Ever since about 1.5 weeks ago, I've had on-and-off symptoms ranging from low fever to difficulty breathing to dry cough that come and go, where much of the time I seem completely healthy and fine. Am I getting a weird prolonged version of the flu again, or is this potentially the coronavirus? Add to that the fact that I know a chain of approximately 4-5 people that have gotten flu-like symptoms and had to stay home, ALL in the past week or so. I've called STAMPS and there seems to be no contingency plan for testing. I called the Emory University Hospital, and they said you need to be admitted to the ER and they will test if you traveled to a high risk country. Maybe nobody is being diagnosed because ... umm ... the infrastructure isn't there?

Just my personal opinion, but I feel that every day the school delays moving classes online is extremely irresponsible. What happens after Spring Break when people return to campus? Also.....can we please make COVID-19 tests more accessible to students, faculty, and staff?"

>	Robinhood Maxed Out Credit Line Last Month Amid Market Tumult

>	In the throes of frantic market uncertainty, traders using Robinhood Markets Inc. faced the ultimate frustration: Their accounts kept malfunctioning. Behind the scenes, the online brokerage was already bracing for financial strains.

>	Robinhood drew its entire $200 million credit facility from Barclays Plc, Citigroup Inc. and JPMorgan Chase & Co., according to people familiar with the matter. It made the move just as fears of the coronavirus set off more than two weeks of violent market swings and heavy volume, during which Robinhood’s trading platform suffered three significant outages.

>	“Our capital position remains strong,” the Menlo Park, California-based firm said in an emailed statement, saying the decision to borrow predated and was entirely unrelated to the outages. “We determined it was prudent to draw on our credit line during the week of Feb. 24 in light of market volatility. That capital was returned in full last week.”

>	It said it’s not unusual for companies to take precautionary measures during such market conditions.

>	“Companies don’t tap their credit line unless they need to,” said David Ritter, an analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence, who spoke generally about the issue without commenting directly on Robinhood. When companies do, it’s “perhaps not a good signal with regard to their cash burn, which could make creditors nervous.”

>	Repeated Outages

>	In the days since it tapped the line of credit, Robinhood’s platform has repeatedly gone dark for more than an hour at a time, including an outage March 2 that spanned an entire U.S. trading session, in which the S&P 500 surged 4.6%.

>	Robinhood said last week that a confluence of factors -- record account sign-ups along with highly volatile and historic market conditions -- led to unprecedented stress on the firm’s infrastructure.

>	That heavy load caused the so-called Domain Name System, or DNS, to fail. The system is essentially the phone book that computers use to turn a domain name into an IP address, and it’s how users access websites around the world.

>	On Monday, Robinhood faced a fresh breakdown as U.S. stocks plunged. Stocks tumbled so hard they set off a market-wide trading halt minutes after the open. And by day’s end, the S&P 500 was down 7.6%, the worst performance since the depths of 2008’s financial crisis.

>	“We know this interruption was frustrating for our customers -- especially after last week and on a day that trading was halted,” the company said in the statement. “Our platform is now fully operational and we’re working hard to improve our service during these historic and volatile market conditions.”

>	The firm declined to comment further on what sparked Monday’s disruption.

>	Engineering Focus

>	Robinhood, founded in 2013 by Vlad Tenev and Baiju Bhatt, pioneered commission-free trading, a move that’s since been copied by larger online brokers including Charles Schwab Corp. The startup has attracted 10 million users and is now backed by venture capital firms including Index Ventures, Andreessen Horowitz and Sequoia, garnering a valuation of $7.6 billion.

>	The company has been increasingly focused on improving the reliability of its service in recent years, and in mid-2018 hired Adam Wolff from Facebook Inc. to lead its squad of engineers.

>	When Wolff joined, Robinhood’s entire engineering workforce was the size of the group of specialists he’d led at Facebook, he previously said. He has been focused on adding staff and last month hired former Facebook colleague Paul Tarjan.

>	“An area where we plan to focus is one we continue to invest in heavily as a company -- compliance,” Wolff said in a blog post announcing the hiring. “It’s fundamental to our focus on our customers and our ability to safely and confidently move forward as a firm.”

>	Shaken Confidence

>	Software mishaps have rocked Robinhood before. In late 2018, the company’s options trading service had an outage that locked consumers out of their accounts and stopped them from closing positions. Employees had to call affected clients to apologize, according to people familiar with the matter.

>	For its latest outages, Robinhood has created a dedicated customer service team to work directly with customers, the company said in a statement. The impact among customers “varies significantly due to the nature of our business,” it said.

>	The latest technology problems have drawn the attention of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, which has been in touch with Robinhood on the matter, according to a spokeswoman for the brokerage regulator. The firm previously agreed to pay $1.25 million to the watchdog for allegedly failing to ensure customers received best prices for securities orders. It didn’tadmit or deny the allegations when settling the complaint.

>	Financial technology startups can risk eroding customer trust with outages, said John Bartleman, president of TradeStationGroup Inc., a rival online trading firm.

>	“If you’re a smaller fintech startup, your reputation is everything,” he said “If you can’t get in, you lose all trust in a brand.”

>	A growing number of Robinhood users on social media have been reporting trouble with closing their accounts. They’re also criticizing the $75 fee associated with the transferring to another platform.

>	Pankaj Sharma, a New Jersey IT professional with a $70,000 Robinhood account, said he sent an email to the company when he realized the site was down March 2, but didn’t receive a response until after the market closed. He’s now considering moving his money to a different brokerage.

>	“It’s really shaken my confidence,” he said by phone."

Homemade masks absolutely work and they're a scalable and low cost solution to protecting yourself! [A cotton t-shirt or tea towel fashioned into an improvised mask](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/258525804_Testing_the_Efficacy_of_Homemade_Masks_Would_They_Protect_in_an_Influenza_Pandemic) has been shown to be ~60% as effective as a surgical mask. It's not ideal but it's far better than nothing and something most people can make with material on hand. [There are videos on Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJaVBt8q6g8) on how to make masks from everyday materials (I just picked the first one I could find, I can't vouch for it's quality. Please suggest better resources and I will update this post).

If you don't have access to commercial masks, make sure every time you go out in public, you have at least something covering your nose and mouth (if only to prevent you from touching them). 

Avoid eating out as much as you can as it's the one time where it's impractical to be masked. If you must eat out, sit at the table so nobody is directly facing each other and find the table the furthest away from other tables if possible. Otherwise, takeout (better), delivery (even better) and cooking at home (best) should be your preferred strategies for nutrition.

Also, if you wear both glasses and contacts, go outside with your glasses on, they've been shown to help you avoid touching your eyes. If you don't wear glasses, a simple pair of drugstore ""fashion"" glasses (with lenses in them) is a cheap form of insurance. Goggles like you see in a science lab are better if they're still available where you are.

When you arrive home, wash your hands, take off any PPE and then wash your hands again. If your PPE is made from cloth only, then boil/steam your PPE and let it completely dry before using again. Otherwise, figure out the best way to sterilize with materials you have on hand but always allow to air dry until completely dry and then wait a few more hours before reusing. If absolutely necessary and for fragile materials such as N95 masks, you can hang in a well ventilated place and allow to air dry for 5 days before using again if this is your best option (although the science is still unclear on whether the virus can last for 5 days on a dry, fabric surface). 

All of this is simple, basic stuff that can reduce your chances of getting sick, not to zero, but to a substantial enough margin that it's a no-brainer not to do it.

At this point the game is too small. Our goal shouldn't even be to win the white house. But to stop climate change. Maybe with Coronavirus breathing down our neck, and our economy grinding down to a halt, maybe we'll rethink our approach to business, to daily working life. But besides that, where are we to agitate, to direct our energy? Into public transport? community clinics? health care assistance? Medical and Student loan jubilees? Is that what we got left?

A series of missed chances by the federal government to ensure more widespread testing came during the early days of the outbreak, when containment would have been easier.
By Sheri Fink and Mike Baker

Updated 10:06 p.m. ET

A research project in Seattle tried to conduct early tests for the new coronavirus but ran into red tape before circumventing federal officials and confirming a case.Grant Hindsley for The New York Times
Dr. Helen Y. Chu, an infectious disease expert in Seattle, knew that the United States did not have much time.
In late January, the first confirmed American case of the coronavirus had landed in her area. Critical questions needed answers: Had the man infected anyone else? Was the deadly virus already lurking in other communities and spreading?
As luck would have it, Dr. Chu had a way to monitor the region. For months, as part of a research project into the flu, she and a team of researchers had been collecting nasal swabs from residents experiencing symptoms throughout the Puget Sound region.
To repurpose the tests for monitoring the coronavirus, they would need the support of state and federal officials. But nearly everywhere Dr. Chu turned, officials repeatedly rejected the idea, interviews and emails show, even as weeks crawled by and outbreaks emerged in countries outside of China, where the infection began.
By Feb. 25, Dr. Chu and her colleagues could not bear to wait any longer. They began performing coronavirus tests, without government approval.
What came back confirmed their worst fear. They quickly had a positive test from a local teenager with no recent travel history. The coronavirus had already established itself on American soil without anybody realizing it.
“It must have been here this entire time,” Dr. Chu recalled thinking with dread. “It’s just everywhere already.”
In fact, officials would later discover through testing, the virus had already contributed to the deaths of two people, and it would go on to kill 20 more in the Seattle region over the following days.
Federal and state officials said the flu study could not be repurposed because it did not have explicit permission from research subjects; the labs were also not certified for clinical work. While acknowledging the ethical questions, Dr. Chu and others argued there should be more flexibility in an emergency during which so many lives could be lost. On Monday night, state regulators told them to stop testing altogether.
The failure to tap into the flu study, detailed here for the first time, was just one in a series of missed chances by the federal government to ensure more widespread testing during the early days of the outbreak, when containment would have been easier. Instead, local officials across the country were left to work blindly as the crisis grew undetected and exponentially.
Even now, after weeks of mounting frustration toward federal agencies over flawed test kits and burdensome rules, states with growing cases such as New York and California are struggling to test widely for the coronavirus. The continued delays have made it impossible for officials to get a true picture of the scale of the growing outbreak, which has now spread to at least 36 states and Washington, D.C.
Dr. Robert R. Redfield, director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said in an interview on Friday that acting quickly was critical for combating an outbreak. “Time matters,” he said.
He insisted that despite the rocky start, there was still time to beat back the coronavirus in the United States. “It’s going to take rigorous, aggressive public health — what I like to say, block and tackle, block and tackle, block and tackle, block and tackle,” he said. “That means if you find a new case, you isolate it.”
But the Seattle Flu Study illustrates how existing regulations and red tape — sometimes designed to protect privacy and health — have impeded the rapid rollout of testing nationally, while other countries ramped up much earlier and faster. Faced with a public health emergency on a scale potentially not seen in a century, the United States has not responded nimbly.
The C.D.C.’s own effort to create a system for monitoring the virus around the country, using established government surveillance networks for the flu, has not yet built steam. And as late as last week, after expanding authorizations for commercial and academic institutions to make tests, administration officials provided conflicting accounts of when a significant increase in tests would be available.
In states like Maine, Missouri and Michigan, where there are few or no known infections, state public health officials say they have more than enough tests to meet demand.
But it remains unclear how many Americans have been tested for the coronavirus. The C.D.C. says approximately 8,500 specimens or nose swabs have been taken since the beginning of the outbreak — a figure that is almost certainly larger than the number of people tested since one person can have multiple swabs. By comparison, South Korea, which discovered its first case around the same time as the United States, has reported having the capacity to test roughly 10,000 people a day since late February.
A prime mission
As soon as the genetic sequence of the coronavirus was published in January, the C.D.C.’s first job was to develop a diagnostic test. “That’s our prime mission,” Dr. Redfield said, “to get eyes on this thing.”
The agency also released criteria for deciding which individuals should be tested for the virus — at first only those who had a fever and respiratory issues and had traveled from the outbreak’s origin in Wuhan, China.
The criteria were so strict that the sick man in the Seattle area who had visited Wuhan did not meet it. Still, worried state health officials pushed to get him checked, and the C.D.C. agreed. Local officials sent a sample to Atlanta and the results came back positive.
Officials monitored 70 people who were in contact with the man, including 50 who consented to getting nose swabs, and none tested positive for the coronavirus. But there was still the possibility that someone had been missed, said Dr. Scott Lindquist, the state epidemiologist for communicable diseases.
Around this time, the Washington State Department of Health began discussions with the Seattle Flu Study already going on in the state.
But there was a hitch: The flu project primarily used research laboratories, not clinical ones, and its coronavirus test was not approved by the Food and Drug Administration. And so the group was not certified to provide test results to anyone outside of their own investigators. They began discussions with state, C.D.C. and F.D.A. officials to figure out a solution, according to emails and interviews.
Dr. Scott F. Dowell, a former high-ranking C.D.C. official and a current deputy director at the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, which funds the Seattle Flu Study, asked for help from the leaders of the C.D.C.’s coronavirus response. “Hoping there is a solution,” he wrote on Feb. 10.
Later, Dr. Lindquist, the state epidemiologist in Washington, wrote an email to Dr. Alicia Fry, the chief of the C.D.C.’s epidemiology and prevention branch, requesting the study be used to test for the coronavirus.
C.D.C. officials repeatedly said it would not be possible. “If you want to use your test as a screening tool, you would have to check with F.D.A.,” Gayle Langley, an officer at the C.D.C.’s National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Disease, wrote back in an email on Feb. 16. But the F.D.A. could not offer the approval because the lab was not certified as a clinical laboratory under regulations established by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, a process that could take months.
Dr. Chu and Dr. Lindquist tried repeatedly to wrangle approval to use the Seattle Flu Study. The answers were always no.
“We felt like we were sitting, waiting for the pandemic to emerge,” Dr. Chu said. “We could help. We couldn’t do anything.”"

I don't feel like we're at Italy level, BUT I don't work at the hospital that is taking the LifeCare patients (who are the vast majority of the deaths.) Testing has been a huge issue here - it's been an uphill battle trying to get patients, let alone those not admitted, tested, and testing that does get OK'd seems to be inconsistent (in terms of how strict to the criteria they're following.) My employer has no interest in offering testing for employees who have been exposed - we have been told to perform twice-daily self-monitoring at home and call out [with no extra PTO offered] if we spike a fever or have an uncontrolled cough. There are others who have made it easily accessible to staff - see [the UW's drive through testing service](https://www.kiro7.com/news/local/uw-medicine-creates-drive-through-coronavirus-testing-employees/FKCHXANUPJETHF6EYHTVBH22GI/). Our ED is typically hopping all day and most of the night - a LOT of people coming in for respiratory complaints. Still seeing a lot of flu and rsv + swabs result from it. Would be easier on them if public testing was more accessible. It's common knowledge at this point that there are probably hundreds, if not thousands, of cases out in the public that simply haven't been tested for d/t a lack of access. The guidelines for everything have been changing constantly and it's a struggle to keep up with it and enforce consistently - morale is pretty low. 

Most hospitals and SNFs/nursing homes have implemented visiting hour restrictions, although I know ours is struggling in terms of enforcement (people seem to get *why* we're doing it, but still protest and stomp their feet and try to get around it, especially where the ICU is concerned.) Everyone I know across multiple facilities is reporting that PPE supply is dwindling, and corners are starting to be cut to stretch it out. Lots of people in the public protesting that they can't find masks/hand sanitizer/cleansing wipes. Hoarding is commonplace - stores frequently have empty shelves, despite restocking, of anything non-perishable and the, of course, coronavirus cure, toilet paper. Some school districts are still open (Seattle Public Schools); others have shut down individual schools with known cases, or shut down altogether (Northshore.) The traffic in the area has lightened significantly as more businesses have instituted mandatory work-from-home policies and some events have been canceled."

So this weekend was actually really interesting because despite the fact that there was a big blockbuster family movie released (Pixar's Onward) it actually underperformed expectations by alot. There's probably reasons beyond Coronavirus for that - the movie's trailers haven't been getting big buzz and it has one of the lowest audience ratings ""Cinemascores"" for a Pixar movie since Cars 2 - but another factor was that there were far fewer ""walkups"" than normal, basically business from people that didn't buy tickets in advance. In fact, Sunday had unusually low business, resulting in the film's gross going almost a million below estimates. It implies that at least some families started getting hesitant to go to the theatre as the weekend got nearer, which is notable considering the fact that official case numbers only really started to grow  during and after the weekend. 

That having been said, a couple of movies thats relatively big with older audiences - The Way Back and Invisible Man - did pretty good/okay-for-the-kind-of-movie-it-is business over the weekend, so that's also something to look out for."

Please listen to public health experts who strongly suggest social distancing to help mitigate the spread. For a good justification, see [1]. Ignoring the death rate, the hospitalization rate alone is worrisome. Did you see how quickly stores ran out of Purell? Now imagine CVS = hospital and Purell = ventilators.

Second, this virus spreads exponentially [2], meaning that even if another country has many more cases, the US could be only days or weeks behind [3]. The virus is almost certainly currently spreading in NYC. Now is the time to act. Please read this report from a doctor in Lombardy, Italy, which is maybe a week or two ahead of the US in terms of number of infected [4]. That report is obviously hearsay, but it matches more traditional sources [5].

Finally, ""I'll probably be fine"" is not an ethical argument. Imagine this: you currently have COVID-19 but you do not know it. You will live, no problem. However, if you practice social distancing, every person who would have gotten it from you will not. Every person those people would have given it to will not. You break the chain. This is why exponential growth, while powerful, can be slowed down dramatically. The goal is simple: buy doctors and researchers time.

How should you act? Do not listen to me. The World Health Organization has very good, up-to-date resources [6].

That's literally a quote from the Philadelphia Department of Public Health spokesperson, made earlier today on our very own subreddit.  It was a rhetorical question, I guess.  Because their answer, based on their inaction, is:  ""Nah, what does a day or two matter in the context of a city-wide pandemic?  Think of all those Irish pubs that are going to miss out on an extra busy Sunday!""

Meanwhile, the top post currently on /r/all is demonstrates how delaying an infections (which are, in all likelihood, inevitable at this point) is [absolutely critical to flattening the curve of cases](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/fgi2pi/even_if_covid19_is_unavoidable_delaying/) and keeping our health system from becoming overwhelmed.  

I hope that this all blows over without many cases or deaths in our area.  Maybe it will, maybe it won't.  The actions that city leaders take in the next few days are going to affect how severely we are affected.  But if it hits us hard because we didn't take the appropriate precautionary measures, we should remember that our health department chose increased Guinness sales over the possible containment and delay of the most significant viral outbreak in the past 100 years."

A prepared city would be open and honest with their citizens, while maintaining patient confidentiality. They would inform public if it was community spread or travel related, and where from. In the community, they would alert people where that person has been. Other countries are doing it. Other cities and states are doing it.

In late January, the first confirmed American case of the coronavirus had landed in her area. Critical questions needed answers: Had the man infected anyone else? Was the deadly virus already lurking in other communities and spreading?

As luck would have it, Dr. Chu had a way to monitor the region. For months, as part of a research project into the flu, she and a team of researchers had been collecting nasal swabs from residents experiencing symptoms throughout the Puget Sound region.

To repurpose the tests for monitoring the coronavirus, they would need the support of state and federal officials. But nearly everywhere Dr. Chu turned, officials repeatedly rejected the idea, interviews and emails show, even as weeks crawled by and outbreaks emerged in countries outside of China, where the infection began.

By Feb. 25, Dr. Chu and her colleagues could not bear to wait any longer. They began performing coronavirus tests, without government approval.

What came back confirmed their worst fear. They quickly had a positive test from a local teenager with no recent travel history. The coronavirus had already established itself on American soil without anybody realizing it.

“It must have been here this entire time,” Dr. Chu recalled thinking with dread. “It’s just everywhere already.”

In fact, officials would later discover through testing, the virus had already contributed to the deaths of two people, and it would go on to kill 20 more in the Seattle region over the following days.

Federal and state officials said the flu study could not be repurposed because it did not have explicit permission from research subjects; the labs were also not certified for clinical work. While acknowledging the ethical questions, Dr. Chu and others argued there should be more flexibility in an emergency during which so many lives could be lost. On Monday night, state regulators told them to stop testing altogether.

The failure to tap into the flu study, detailed here for the first time, was just one in a series of missed chances by the federal government to ensure more widespread testing during the early days of the outbreak, when containment would have been easier. Instead, local officials across the country were left to work blindly as the crisis grew undetected and exponentially.

Even now, after weeks of mounting frustration toward federal agencies over flawed test kits and burdensome rules, states with growing cases such as New York and California are struggling to test widely for the coronavirus. The continued delays have made it impossible for officials to get a true picture of the scale of the growing outbreak, which has now spread to at least 36 states and Washington, D.C.

Dr. Robert R. Redfield, director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said in an interview on Friday that acting quickly was critical for combating an outbreak. “Time matters,” he said.

He insisted that despite the rocky start, there was still time to beat back the coronavirus in the United States. “It’s going to take rigorous, aggressive public health — what I like to say, block and tackle, block and tackle, block and tackle, block and tackle,” he said. “That means if you find a new case, you isolate it.”

But the Seattle Flu Study illustrates how existing regulations and red tape — sometimes designed to protect privacy and health — have impeded the rapid rollout of testing nationally, while other countries ramped up much earlier and faster. Faced with a public health emergency on a scale potentially not seen in a century, the United States has not responded nimbly.

Get an informed guide to the global outbreak with our daily coronavirus newsletter.

The C.D.C.’s own effort to create a system for monitoring the virus around the country, using established government surveillance networks for the flu, has not yet built steam. And as late as last week, after expanding authorizations for commercial and academic institutions to make tests, administration officials provided conflicting accounts of when a significant increase in tests would be available.

In states like Maine, Missouri and Michigan, where there are few or no known infections, state public health officials say they have more than enough tests to meet demand.

But it remains unclear how many Americans have been tested for the coronavirus. The C.D.C. says approximately 8,500 specimens or nose swabs have been taken since the beginning of the outbreak — a figure that is almost certainly larger than the number of people tested since one person can have multiple swabs. By comparison, South Korea, which discovered its first case around the same time as the United States, has reported having the capacity to test roughly 10,000 people a day since late February.

A prime mission
As soon as the genetic sequence of the coronavirus was published in January, the C.D.C.’s first job was to develop a diagnostic test. “That’s our prime mission,” Dr. Redfield said, “to get eyes on this thing.”

The agency also released criteria for deciding which individuals should be tested for the virus — at first only those who had a fever and respiratory issues and had traveled from the outbreak’s origin in Wuhan, China.

The criteria were so strict that the sick man in the Seattle area who had visited Wuhan did not meet it. Still, worried state health officials pushed to get him checked, and the C.D.C. agreed. Local officials sent a sample to Atlanta and the results came back positive.

Officials monitored 70 people who were in contact with the man, including 50 who consented to getting nose swabs, and none tested positive for the coronavirus. But there was still the possibility that someone had been missed, said Dr. Scott Lindquist, the state epidemiologist for communicable diseases.

Around this time, the Washington State Department of Health began discussions with the Seattle Flu Study already going on in the state.

But there was a hitch: The flu project primarily used research laboratories, not clinical ones, and its coronavirus test was not approved by the Food and Drug Administration. And so the group was not certified to provide test results to anyone outside of their own investigators. They began discussions with state, C.D.C. and F.D.A. officials to figure out a solution, according to emails and interviews.

Dr. Scott F. Dowell, a former high-ranking C.D.C. official and a current deputy director at the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, which funds the Seattle Flu Study, asked for help from the leaders of the C.D.C.’s coronavirus response. “Hoping there is a solution,” he wrote on Feb. 10.

Later, Dr. Lindquist, the state epidemiologist in Washington, wrote an email to Dr. Alicia Fry, the chief of the C.D.C.’s epidemiology and prevention branch, requesting the study be used to test for the coronavirus.

C.D.C. officials repeatedly said it would not be possible. “If you want to use your test as a screening tool, you would have to check with F.D.A.,” Gayle Langley, an officer at the C.D.C.’s National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Disease, wrote back in an email on Feb. 16. But the F.D.A. could not offer the approval because the lab was not certified as a clinical laboratory under regulations established by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, a process that could take months.

Dr. Chu and Dr. Lindquist tried repeatedly to wrangle approval to use the Seattle Flu Study. The answers were always no.

“We felt like we were sitting, waiting for the pandemic to emerge,” Dr. Chu said. “We could help. We couldn’t do anything.”

Sense of exasperation
As Washington State debated with the federal officials over what to do, the C.D.C. confronted the daunting task of testing more widely for the coronavirus.

The C.D.C. had designed its own test as it typically does during an outbreak. Several other countries also developed their own tests.

But when the C.D.C. shipped test kits to public labs across the country, some local health officials began reporting that the test was producing invalid results.

The C.D.C. promised that replacement kits would be distributed within days, but the problem stretched on for over two weeks. Only five state laboratories were able to test in that period. Washington and New York were not among them."

- COVID19 is ""just beginning""

- Airborne disease discussion // ""it's just the breathing""

- It's not going away tomorrow, or the day after, more like months and months

- Masks aren't as effective as you might think

- It's not just a ""old person's disease""

- Thinks those cruise ships should be brought in and quarantined for testing, not abandoned at sea so the disease can keep spreading and infecting

- A lot of misinformation out there from everywhere

- No vaccines anytime soon, don't get your hopes up

- Closing schools is a big challenge, as it would put huge stress on the parents who rely on schools --- these parents are your nurses and health care workers. Majority of workers don't have sick leave- so no income, yet have to stay home (for their kids)

- Spoke about a health worker contact they have in Milan-- they are being forced to choose who lives/dies. Workers are overloaded as fuck

- We import/rely on other countries for prescription drugs, outages are real

- Rumor #1 debunked: no evidence that saunas help prevent viruses/diseases

- Rumor #2 debunked: no evidence that it's a biological weapon/man-made disease

- *(convo steers off to Chronic Wasting Disease)*

- ""don't worry"" and ""end of humanity"" are both incorrect

- COVID19 is not going away when the weather ""warms up"". Example #1: SARS --- it didn't go away from the ""seasons"", just overlapped timings due to testing. Example #2: MERS coronavirus - weather is hot as all hell and virus transmitted just fine

- It's about 10x as bad as the ""seasonal flu"". Primarily older population, those with underlying health problems (obesity, high blood pressure, etc) will be impacted the most

- Are we really prepared to close all schools and cancel all major public events until this goes away?

- Ultimately, the more people infected will result in slowing down the overall infection as transmission is less likely to occur- huge price to pay of course

- Joe Rogan inquires about the spanish flu--- (0.1% seasonal flu infected die/year), (C19 in China - 2-3%), (spanish flu - 3-3.2% == hardest hit group were 18-25 year olds). Says we may end up around 2% range

- Our only defense? Bulk up your health. Don't miss your medications, eat right, sleep right

- No evidence suggests ""immune system boosters"" are of much help

- Need long term plans re: work, food, etc

- Hand sanitizers: they are great but don't think you're invincible just because you use them

- Says the whole face-touching thing has kinda weak data backing it

- Hand-washing is fine but again, you're not invincible

- Re: the surgeon masks = not really made to protect you from outside sources at all but it does help if you ARE already sick as it shields your coughs from transmitting to the outside

- Re: the n95 respirators = the real good shit but huge shortage; hospitals are running low

- When we realize our front-line healthcare workers are in deep shit due to lack of resources (like proper protection) --> might serve as a public ""hey, what the fuck?""

- Joe asks about White House: Trump hasn't reached out to him(Michael) personally but many white house officials have. He has also consulted those in the CDC and such

- People forget/don't understand we can't mass produce things at a moment's notice. We're already working at a 110% capacity. We should have had our defenses up way in advance. Says we prep for a lot of things, but not our healthcare industry

- On the topic of vaccines: we could've had vaccines at the ready, maybe not for this strand of corona, but something. Unfortunately public interest ""faded away"" once SARS cleared up. Even a imperfect 50% vaccine would've been a world's difference right now.

- Our health industry budget is like .0001% of our defense budget; points to how a freaking virus is bringing the world's economy to it's knees and not a missile

- Goes back to the school-closing stuff: might cause more deaths as our nurses/health workers are taken away

- Criticizes the lack of planning

- Dismisses ""public panic""--- people just want the truth

- Joe: vaccines are so so so important- hopes this serves as a wake up call to many (such as the anti-vaxxers). Example: during ebola outbreak, thousands of kids died from measles at the same time-- totally preventable. The convo goes off to vaccines for a bit

- Michael talks about his book for a bit, which had an excerpt about China. So why China? Huge population and food source that is predominately wild life; crowded society by nature; huge viral melting pot. Talks about his (Michael's) first-hand experience with the ""wet markets"". Talks about the bush meat situation during the ebola outbreak. Jamie pulls up wet market stuff

- They talk about the actual flu/influenza for a bit

- They talk about vitamins, supplements, and stuff like that- not necessarily about COVID19

- They talk about Lyme Disease for a bit"

There’s an old brain teaser that goes like this: You have a pond of a certain size, and upon that pond, a single lilypad. This particular species of lily pad reproduces once a day, so that on day two, you have two lily pads. On day three, you have four, and so on.

Now the teaser. “If it takes the lily pads 48 days to cover the pond completely, how long will it take for the pond to be covered halfway?”

The answer is 47 days. Moreover, at day 40, you’ll barely know the lily pads are there.

That grim math explains why so many people — including me — are worried about the novel coronavirus, which causes a disease known as covid-19. And why so many other people think we are panicking over nothing.

During the current flu season, they point out, more than 250,000 people have been hospitalized in the United States, and 14,000 have died, including more than 100 children. As of this writing, the coronavirus has killed 29 people, and our caseload is in the hundreds. Why are we freaking out about the tiny threat while ignoring the big one?

Quite a number of people have suggested that it’s because the media just wants President Trump to look bad. Trump seems particularly fond of this suggestion.

But go back to those lily pads: When something dangerous is growing exponentially, everything looks fine until it doesn’t. In the early days of the Wuhan epidemic, when no one was taking precautions, the number of cases appears to have doubled every four to five days.

The crisis in northern Italy is what happens when a fast doubling rate meets a “threshold effect,” where the character of an event can massively change once its size hits a certain threshold.

In this case, the threshold is things such as ICU beds. If the epidemic is small enough, doctors can provide respiratory support to the significant fraction of patients who develop complications, and relatively few will die. But once the number of critical patients exceeds the number of ventilators and ICU beds and other critical-care facilities, mortality rates spike.

Daniele Macchini, a doctor in Bergamo, Italy, recently posted a heart-stopping account to Facebook of what he and his colleagues have endured: the hospital emptying out, the wards eerily silent as they waited for the patients they couldn’t quite believe would come … and then, the “tsunami.”

“One after the other the departments that had been emptied fill up at an impressive pace. … The boards with the names of the patients, of different colors depending on the operating unit, are now all red and instead of surgery you see the diagnosis, which is always the damned same: bilateral interstitial pneumonia.”

A British health-care worker shared a message from a doctor in Italy, who alleged that covid-19 patients in their hospital who are over 65, or have complicating conditions, aren’t even being considered for the most intensive forms of supportive treatment.

The experts are telling us that here in the United States, we can avoid hitting that threshold where sizable regions of the country will suddenly step into hell. We still have time to #flattenthecurve, as a popular infographic put it, slowing the spread so that the number of cases never exceeds what our health system can handle. The United States has an unusually high number of ICU beds, which gives us a head start. But we mustn’t squander that advantage through complacency.

So everyone needs to understand a few things.

First, the virus is here, and it is spreading quickly, even though everything looks normal. Right now, the United States has more reported cases than Italy had in late February. What matters isn’t what you can see but what you can’t: the patients who will need ICU care in two to six weeks.

Second, this is not “a bad flu.” It kills more of its hosts, and it will spread farther unless we take aggressive steps to slow it down, because no one is yet immune to this disease. It will be quite some time before the virus runs out of new patients.

Third, we can fight it. Despite early exposure, Singapore and Hong Kong have kept their caseloads low, not by completely shutting down large swaths of their economies as China did but through aggressive personal hygiene and “social distancing.” South Korea seems to be getting its initial outbreak under control using similar measures. If we do the same, we can not only keep our hospitals from overloading but also buy researchers time to develop vaccines and therapies.

Fourth, and most important: We are all in this together. It is your responsibility to keep America safe by following the CDC guidelines, just as much as it is House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s or President Trump’s responsibility to lead us to safety. And until this virus is beaten, we all need to act like it."

And yes it does prove that this virus is a challenge. However, take the action also with a grain of salt and know that it is not an indication that the virus has suddenly become more severe. The virus is still the same severity as when it broke out in Italy. In fact, statistics of case fatality rates  (CFR) are largely in line with the information coming out of China, with the highest being in the 80+ age range at \~14% (meaning that almost **80% of the elderly DO recover**, though!), and that, for the age range such as 20-29, it is **\~0.2%**. Even age ranges such as in the 40s and 50s is still hovering around **\~1-1.5%**.  Italy's Lombardy region is one of the nation's most developed and affluent. They were signaling h[ow their healthcare facilities are swamped](https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/09/europe/coronavirus-italy-lockdown-intl/index.html) because of the fear of the virus and the many reporting to clinics and hospitals because they are worried they have it. As a result, outlets like CNN and BBC reported that some doctors across Italy actually *asked* for the lockdown to be nationwide -- because if Lombardy's facilities couldn't handle it, the rest of the nation certainly couldn't handle a surge. This is preventative and proactive. It is not (entirely) a reactive measure. I.e. the Italian government has taken this step to prevent it from becoming Lombardy-scale across the whole nation. If anything, it is good news. We all hope for a speedy recovery for those in Italy who are ill and wish the absolute best for all its citizens in this difficult period. Reframing the way these developments are presented can help a lot with the anxiety that surrounds them. It is a serious event, no doubt, but serious doesn't automatically mean bad and doesn't mean everyone should panic.

P.s. I know people living in Italy, and everyone I've spoken to says overall things are okay, they're spending more time at home and the streets are much emptier. Stores have food and emergency services are available and functional. Hope this helps"

The Association of Public Health Laboratories made what it called an “extraordinary and rare request” of Dr. Stephen Hahn, the commissioner of the F.D.A., asking him to use his discretion to allow state and local public health laboratories to create their own tests for the virus.

“We are now many weeks into the response with still no diagnostic or surveillance test available outside of C.D.C. for the vast majority of our member laboratories,” Scott Becker, the chief executive of the association, wrote in a letter to Dr. Hahn.

Dr. Hahn responded two days later, saying in a letter that “false diagnostic test results can lead to significant adverse public health consequences” and that the laboratories were welcome to submit their own tests for emergency authorization.

But the approval process for laboratory-developed tests was proving onerous. Private and university clinical laboratories, which typically have the latitude to develop their own tests, were frustrated about the speed of the F.D.A. as they prepared applications for emergency approvals from the agency for their coronavirus tests.

Dr. Alex Greninger, an assistant professor at the University of Washington Medical Center in Seattle, said he became exasperated in mid-February as he communicated with the F.D.A. over getting his application ready to begin testing. “This virus is faster than the F.D.A.,” he said, adding that at one point the agency required him to submit materials through the mail in addition to over email.

New tests typically require validation — running the test on known positive samples from a patient or a copy of the virus genome. The F.D.A.’s process called for five. Obtaining such samples has been hard because most hospital labs have not seen coronavirus cases yet, said Dr. Karen Kaul, chair of the department of pathology and laboratory medicine at NorthShore University HealthSystem in Illinois.

She said she had to scramble to obtain virus RNA from a laboratory in Europe. “Everyone is trying to figure out what we can get to help us gather the data that we need,” she said.

The F.D.A. has disputed that it moved too slowly, saying that it provided emergency authorization for two laboratory-developed tests within 24 hours of a completed submission — one was the C.D.C.’s test and the other a test developed by New York’s Wadsworth laboratory after it had trouble verifying the C.D.C.’s test.

‘What do we do?’
On the other side of the country in Seattle, Dr. Chu and her flu study colleagues, unwilling to wait any longer, decided to begin running samples.

A technician in the laboratory of Dr. Lea Starita who was testing samples soon got a hit.

“I’m like, ‘Oh my God,’” Dr. Starita said. “I just took off running” to the office of the study’s program managers. “We got one,” she told them. “What do we do?”

Members of the research group discussed the ethics of what to do next.

“What we were allowed to do was to keep it to ourselves,” Dr. Chu said. “But what we felt like we needed to do was to tell public health.”

They decided the right thing to do was to inform local health officials.

The case was a teenager, in the same county where the first coronavirus case had surfaced, who had a flu swab just a few days before but had no travel history and no link to any known case.

The state laboratory, finally able to begin testing, confirmed the result the next morning. The teenager, who had recovered from his illness, was located and informed just after he entered his school building. He was sent home and the school was later closed as a precaution.

Later that day, the investigators and Seattle health officials gathered with representatives of the C.D.C. and the F.D.A. to discuss what happened. The message from the federal government was blunt. “What they said on that phone call very clearly was cease and desist to Helen Chu,” Dr. Lindquist remembered. “Stop testing.”

A silent spread
Still, the troubling finding reshaped how officials understood the outbreak. Seattle Flu Study scientists quickly sequenced the genome of the virus, finding a genetic variation also present in the country’s first coronavirus case.

The implications were unnerving. There was a good chance that the virus had been circulating silently in the community for around six weeks, infecting potentially hundreds of people.

On a phone call the day after the C.D.C. and F.D.A. had told Dr. Chu to stop, officials relented, but only partially, the researchers recalled. They would allow the study’s laboratories to test cases and report the results only in future samples. They would need to use a new consent form that explicitly mentioned that results of the coronavirus tests might be shared with the local health department.

They were not to test the thousands of samples that had already been collected.

The same day, the F.D.A. said it would relax its rules and allow clinical labs to begin using their own coronavirus tests as long as they submitted evidence that they worked to the agency. Under that new policy, according to an agency representative on Tuesday, it had heard from 14 labs, with 10 already beginning patient testing.

On March 2, the Seattle Flu Study’s institutional review board at the University of Washington determined that it would be unethical for the researchers not to test and report the results in a public health emergency, Dr. Starita said. Since then, her laboratory has found and reported numerous additional cases, all of which have been confirmed.

As new samples came in, Dr. Starita’s laboratory also worked their way backward through some older samples that had been sitting in the freezers for weeks, finding cases that date back to at least Feb. 20 — seven days before public health officials had any idea the virus was in the community.

The scientists said they believe that they will find evidence that the virus was infecting people even earlier, and that they could have alerted authorities sooner if they had been allowed to test.

But on Monday night, state regulators, enforcing Medicare rules, stepped in and again told them to stop until they could finish getting certified as a clinical laboratory, a process that could take many weeks.

In the days since the teenager’s test, the Seattle region has spun into crisis, with dozens of people testing positive and at least 22 dying — many of them infected in a nursing home that had unknowingly been suffering casualties since Feb. 19.

The availability of testing for coronavirus remains uneven, with some people able to easily obtain tests in certain parts of the country while others have been turned away. Some state officials fear that the virus is spreading far faster than the capacity for testing is increasing.

Looking back, Dr. Chu said she understood why the regulations that stymied the flu study’s efforts for weeks existed. “Those protections are in place for a reason,” she said. “You want to protect human subjects. You want to do things in an ethical way.”

The frustration, she said, was how long it took to cut through red tape to try to save lives in an outbreak that had the potential to explode in Washington State and spread in many other regions. “I don’t think people knew that back then,” she said. “We know it now.”"

This can be a huge deal, and will probably be worse than it could have been because of an underfunded public health system and an Administration who is downplaying it for political reasons. At an individual level, for most people, it is not life threatening, and like others have said, will be sort of like the flu. However, from what we can tell, the mortality rate from COVID-19 may be as high as 3% (but at least 1-2%), compared to a flu mortality rate of 0.1%.   

  

On a population level, however, things get much worse. It's not about individuals feeling sick - it's that our hospital system is does not have the capacity to hold and care for the amount of people that would need to be in the ICU if it spreads rapidly. We don't have enough ventilators in the U.S. to treat those with respiratory problems if it spreads too rapidly. And this is just for the coronavirus - if this overwhelms the hospitals (like in Italy right now), there will be shortages of staff, space, and equipment to handle the regular load a hospital usually has.  

  

This doesn't mean that you should be overly anxious in your day-to-day life. If there are no cases in your area, if you wash your hands thoroughly, disinfect surface, stay out of work when you feel sick, and keep an eye out for symptoms, and only travel when you have to in the next few weeks, you will probably be fine. All of the gatherings (concerts, conferences, etc) that are being cancelled now are good ways to prevent the spread going forward. However, we just don't know how bad it's going to get yet. Don't overly worry, but there's no evidence at this point that this *won't* become a huge deal for a large portion of the population."

Why did their cases skyrocket while ours seem to slowly be growing? Size? Population density? It can’t be cleanliness, can it?

Oh man!  I am not a scientist or doctor or statistician, but I am high, so let's take this journey together because I also ask dumb questions!

Alright, so I googled and found this site:

[https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/country/italy/](https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/country/italy/)

[https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/country/us/](https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/country/us/)

Italy:

First case: Feb 15th (3 cases)

Breaking 100 cases: Feb 23rd (157 cases) - 8 days from start

Breaking 500 cases: Feb 27th (655 cases) - 12 days from start

US:

First case: Feb 15th (15 cases)

Breaking 100 cases: March 2nd (100 cases) - 16 days from start

Breaking 500 cases: March 8th (541 cases) - 22 days from start

&#x200B;

So, obviously this is not scientific or statistically accurate on any scale, but you're right - it was slower to start here in the states than in Italy.  We don't really have enough data yet to compare, but it took us 200% longer to get to 100 as Italy, but only 50% longer to get to 500.  If that trends continues, we'll overtake Italy pretty soon.

Now, one key difference is that Italy seems to have been aggressively testing and reporting from the beginning, and the US appears to be avoiding testing or accurate reporting.  So our numbers could actually already be worse than Italy, it just isn't being reported.  Anecdotally, a CDC family friend said we should assume there are many, many more cases than have been reported.  Take that with a grain of salt.

Now, let's get morbid.  Deaths.

Italy:

First Death: Feb 21st

Breaking 10 deaths: Feb 25th (4 days from start)

Breaking 20 deaths: Feb 28th (7 days from start)

Breaking 30 deaths: Mar 1st (9 days from start)

US:

First Death: Feb 29th

Breaking 10 deaths: Mar 4th (4 days from start)

Breaking 20 deaths: Mar 8th (8 days from start)

Breaking 30 deaths: Mar 10th (10 days from start)

&#x200B;

Again, I am not a mathmagician, I'm just high.  It looks to this layman like we're tracking a lot like Italy, just about 7-9 days behind them.

You get the milk, I'll get the bread.

COVID-19 Security Assessment (Small Business, personal contact with clients)

10 Mar 20

**Virus Facts**

**\*Not comprehensive; the following is collected from public sources, and is subject to frequent change\***

COVID-19 is the disease that is contracted when a person is infected by the coronavirus “SARS-CoV-2”

Experts predict 40% to 70% of the world’s population will be infected by end of 2020

Considered by some experts to be easier to contract than the Flu; the virus is believed to enter the body through the mouth, nose, eyes and other mucus membranes in the body. People are typically infected after touching a contaminated surface then unknowingly introducing the virus into their own body.

Present number of infected persons is 114,952 in 112 countries and is currently trending as increasing with an unknown exponential growth rate. The number of infected persons is widely considered as being under-reported, due to a lack of tests for the virus, poor virus test performance or restrictive testing policies within the regions.

Experts have calculated that approximately 5 % of infected people have required hospital intervention to survive. The likelihood of hospitalization increases with increased age, and when any other health issues are present in the person.

Multiple reports indicate that the virus may be spread without any recognisable symptoms by the carrier.  It may be aerosolized which means it is spread into the air by any cough, sneeze or toilet flush containing the virus and air currents within the area may carry the virus to another contamination area but it is unknown exactly how far it may travel. Medical reports indicate a previous infection is believed to have originated from a fellow bus passenger approximately 5 meters away.

Severe Infection by COVID-19 reported to last up to 1 month, some causing death.

Coronaviruses may survive for 4 to 5 days on paper at room temperature, 9 days on other inanimate objects.

Coronaviruses are inactivated within one minute of sodium hypochlorite solution (Commonly sold as commercial bleach, only specific brands use Sodium Hypochlorite within the solution) and hand sanitizer containing 60%- 70% ethanol but the virus remains on the contaminated surface. Common Soap and detergents surround microscopic particles on contact, including coronavirus, so it can be removed from the surface with water and common hygienic cleaning practices.

Voluntary Quarantine of 14 days has been recommended for anyone that has been in contact with an infected person during the window of infection.  Reports from China indicate the quarantine period directed by the Chinese government has increased to 28 days, due to numerous accounts of transmission after the 14-day period.  Local guidance may increase the recommended quarantine period in the future.

Statistically, everyone should expect to be in quarantine at some point during the course of this virus. There is expected to be at least one other wave of infections, in fall 2020.  There is also a very high likelihood of local school, public gathering place, etc. closures in the near future due to containment measures.

Additionally, a UV light sanitizer box can be used to decontaminate cell phones and paperwork if used within the manufacturers’ instructions. Specifically, commercially available, certified UV sterilizers, or UV lights specifically designed for biological decontamination, installed within the manufacturers directions and operated within a container that is sealed from light seepage while in use, because UV sterilizers destroy any living cells, including human tissue.

**COVID-19 Contingencies and Recommendations**

Virus in area

\-Order office sanitizing supplies

\-Heightened sanitizing and microbe consciousness

\-Monitor known community infections

\-Monitor information of possible client infections

\-Ensure staff knowledge of sanitizing procedures and microbe safety

\-Ensure staff knowledge of COVID-19 symptoms

\-Procure office supplies for contingency planning

\-Sanitize parcels/client paperwork before use and ensure frequent hand washing during work

\-Notify clients of new policies, possible changes to business procedures and what to expect if a client is sick/quarantined or if the staff are sick/quarantined

\-Expect reduced productivity from employees, due to decontamination procedures, a greater frequency of psychological distractions and increased anxiety in the workplace

&#x200B;

Area in quarantine

\-No travel in the area

\-Work remotely, use of cloud network and home teleconferencing 

\-forward office phone to employee 

\-Ensure ability for clients to sign documents remotely, (licence online identification verification) 

\-Business operations are halted except for business functions that can work remotely or from a home business

\-Expect employees that can work during the quarantine to have extremely reduced productivity 

&#x200B;

Office Supply Problems

\- Due to the interruption of regular business operations in China, there is a significant and ongoing disruption in the fabrication and export of goods from that country. Because a large percent of goods worldwide depends on Chinese exports; the cost of office supplies is expected to increase and the availability of many goods is expected to be interrupted during the global course of the virus. 

\-Stock office supplies in the event of an extended interruption. (Business has been halted for two months in some large cities in China)

&#x200B;

Employer Infected

\-Predetermine if office closed or remain open

\-Establish procedures for work flow if employer is unable to work for extended period

\-Quarantine of staff is likely for a minimum of 14 days

\-Detailed decontamination of home and office is required prior to return to business

&#x200B;

Employer household Infected

\-Home quarantine of infected family member is very resource intense and will likely result in household infection to various degrees. Quarantine likely for a minimum of 14 days after the last family member tests negative for the virus. 

\-Expect to not work for the duration of the illness’ course through the household.

\-Expect greatly reduced productivity from employees who are able to work.

\-Detailed decontamination of office is required prior to return of business.

Employee/employee family member sick

\-Global procedure for people in close contact with any person infected with COVID-19, including colleagues, family members and their households, has been to voluntary quarantine for 14 days.  

\-Expect employees will not return to work for a minimum of 14 days after a sequence of tests indicating the infected person is no longer infected and no other family members have symptoms of infection.  

\-Detailed decontamination of home and office is required prior to return to business.

\-Expect greatly reduced productivity from the employees that are able to work.

**Priority items to consider:**

\-UV light sterilizer 

\-Office decontamination supplies

\-Set office infection control policy

\-Is Document Drop Box outside the office practical in order to reduce contact with clients

\-Pre-establish Skype/Facetime accounts for staff and client meetings

\-Obtain video conference equipment for staff and familiarize everyone with the functions. Practice operating remotely during regular business operation 

\-Determine if a secure office cloud network is appropriate and functional for remote business operations and verify it is working properly

\-Determine the requirements and employ a secure document transport/transfer system, such as a courier, encryption software, or USB security keys to allow for remote inter-business and client mail. Verify that the documents transfer system is functional during regular business operation.

\-Determine the applicability for remote identification verification, in the event that personal signatures are required for business operations during a quarantine. Employ a remote identification verification system that is appropriate to your business operations and will satisfy any local legal requirements. 

\- Send and post a newsletter within the office, updating clients and employees of any changes to your business practices."

""I think the coronavirus coverage just sucked all the wind out of the Presidential primary.

So  basically if you're Sanders, your base is college students whose  institutions are going online only and some are beginning to cancel  classes or tell students to leave campus. As well, localities are  beginning to discourage and outright ban gatherings.

Next  weeks results will likely be bad for Sanders and they almost have to  improvise to make up for the lack of physical campaigning possible.

You're starting to see top Dems openly talking about wanting to end this right now, which could backfire on them.

If  the media coverage is anywhere close to accurate, somebody is gonna  mention the concept of postponing primaries scheduled for March or April  since a certain percentage of people will be reluctant to vote due to  the coronavirus.

Now if Trump wins  in November, the consolidation of the Dem establishment and the  coronavirus will be turning points for the Dem primary."""

*All the second houses were open, many Piedmontese and Lombards have chosen to move in anticipation of the blockade, but there are also those who returned in a hurry for fear of being locked out.*

*Sanremo. ""We can't force you to go back, unfortunately. But if you really want to stay here with us, then - please - stay locked in your homes."" The appeal of the Ligurian mayors to the 60,000 tourists who in these days of coronavirus found refuge in the second homes of the Riviere is dramatic, so much so that it ends up being codified in the ordinance issued by the Liguria Region. And it is surreal at the same time. Today the arrival - and the stay - of the guests have become a problem. A danger. The government decree, which has quarantined Lombardy and 14 other provinces - with a ban on entry and exit - has had uncontrollable consequences in the last few hours: people running away from the red and orange areas to hide along the coasts of Liguria, or instead after a weekend at sea they return quickly for fear of remaining isolated forever. The walks, the beaches and the ""guts"" crowded as not even in Ferragosto. The kilometric queues on the motorway. The looted supermarkets. Alassio and Rapallo, Varazze and Portovenere. Small exemplary stories - of ""displaced"" families as at wartime - in all 4 provinces. For a weekend of ordinary madness. ""It's no time for outings,"" suggests Giovanni Toti, the Governor.*

*""I appeal to all the citizens who from Lombardy or the other 11 municipalities in the red zone have come here to Liguria, so that they have the civic sense and the responsibility of not leaving their homes"": Alberto Biancheri, first citizen of Sanremo, tries to keep calm. It is not easy. Since Friday, about ten thousand people - fifteen thousand, according to others - have occupied the second homes of the city of the Riviera dei Fiori and its surroundings. It is better to stay here, where there is sun and good air. With grandparents and small children, as schools are closed and offices are also closed. Yesterday morning the cycle path was swarming, the promenade was a baker. Yes, but these people come from the 'at risk' areas. And the people from Sanremo are understandably worried. ""But what do I do? Do I pick up the tourists one by one, and order them back to Milan?"", Biancheri asks. ""Shocking"", he repeats, disconsolate. He's waiting for communications from the prefecture. Meanwhile, he closed the Casino, and launched a care plan for the elderly. There are 9 positive cases in the hospital, 2 in critical condition.*

*Saturday around noon, 4 kilometers of queue on the A26 at Masone. Piemontese on their way to Western Liguria. In Alassio, with the hotels almost deserted, the presences compared to the second homes are almost ten thousand. ""Welcome visitors,"" said Angelo Galtieri, vice-mayor. ""Woe betide you to treat them as if they were plagued. And we can certainly not force them to go home: but I hope that they too behave with common sense, because the situation is not easy"". No 'witch hunt', he points out. ""But it's important that our guests know how to handle themselves. In the Savona area we're on the edge of the yellow alert, because of sick tourists"".*

*Translated with* [*www.DeepL.com/Translator*](https://www.DeepL.com/Translator) *(free version)*

\*Alassio town, 10.000 inhabitants, now have 20.000.

\*\* Borghetto town have a suspected dead. He is still in the house with her wife, suspected case too. She is alive, spending her time on a terrace outside. His husband body is still untouched on the floor, paramedics who tried to save him are under quarantine. We didn't manage to test them yet, we're waiting for the dead man swab. Liguria is not able to perform many tests, only 694 done since the start of the emergency."

> The guidelines were issued over the weekend, one day after the South by Southwest festival in Austin was canceled and a day before tens of thousands gathered for the Los Angeles Marathon.

> Despite the spread of coronavirus exposure across the state, which has confirmed more than 100 cases, the protocols do not explicitly instruct organizers to cancel any events.

> If a gathering takes place where coronavirus cases have been confirmed, the onus has been on individual participants to refrain from attending if they’re sick, have traveled to a country with an outbreak in the last 14 days or are vulnerable to illness.

> Essentially, it’s up to the organizers to decide what steps to take during a situation that remains fluid, officials have said. The BNP Paribas Open at Indian Wells, one of the top tennis tournaments in the world, was canceled Sunday amid growing concerns over the coronavirus. The fate of the nearby Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival in Riverside County remains unclear.

> When there is no evidence of community spread, officials have advised event organizers to create contingency plans. They should coordinate with community partners, including local public health departments, hotels, airlines and event venues. The state public health department also advises organizers to create a refund policy or institute a remote participation ability.

> Individuals should have access to soap, hand sanitizer and tissues, officials advised. Any person who may fall ill with symptoms seemingly related to coronavirus should be isolated.

> In areas where community spread is confirmed, the state’s public health department is not suggesting outright cancellations. Instead, the most explicit suggestion is that organizers consider canceling nonessential events attended primarily by older individuals or those with a higher risk for illness.

> “People with underlying medical problems, including cardiovascular disease, diabetes, cancer, chronic lung disease and immunosuppression are also likely at higher risk for severe illness,” officials said.

> At least 114 cases of coronavirus have been reported in California, and there has been one death connected to the outbreak. Twenty-four of those cases include individuals who were evacuees from the Diamond Princess cruise ship or were repatriated from flights from Wuhan, China, the epicenter of the virus. A growing number of cases are tied to another Princess Cruises ship, the Grand Princess.

> Gov. Gavin Newsom declared a state of emergency last week as at least 20 counties have been affected.

> Health officials have continued to stress that the public take precautions by hand-washing, and for individuals to stay home if sick. That instruction is especially critical to help protect vulnerable individuals. Younger and healthy people who contract the virus may have mild symptoms. But taking steps to self-isolate when sick helps protects others — including the elderly or those with underlying health issues — who are most at risk for developing serious symptoms."

Except for wrapping duct tape around my head, I’m trying not to get hysterical over the coronavirus.

I know, it’s not funny. If you’re elderly, it’s potentially serious. Maybe. Sometimes but not always. We don’t actually know. Yet, to follow news reporting on the elaborately named coronavirus disease 2019, or covid-19, is to conclude that WE’RE ALL GOING TO DIE. To avoid dying, we’re told, we should wash our hands, steer clear of sick people and stay away from cruises. No problem whatsoever.

If you’re over 60, which until now was the new 40, you should consider “social distancing.”

For something so potentially lethal, at least more than the usual flu but not as much as SARS or MERS, two other coronaviruses, hand-washing seems bland advice considering that people really ought to wash their hands frequently under any circumstances. An aunt of mine gave her nieces, nephews and cousins an early jump on obsessive-compulsive disorder with her greeting whenever we entered the house: “Go wash your hands,” she’d sweetly command. As such things go, I’ve become my aunt.

Social distancing, meanwhile, is my specialty, so I think I’m all set for the duration. I tend to avoid crowds as a personal policy and otherwise have never minded solitude.

On the other hand, what if I’ve been surrounded by sick people without realizing it? We now know that the incubation period of coronavirus, which can be as much as two weeks, means people can be infected and contagious without being symptomatic. And, without adequate tests, we have no way of knowing how many people are infected. The latest number reported Tuesday — more than 750 cases in the United States — is surely far below the actual number.

Self-quarantine is the state of nature for an at-home writer in residence. It comes with the job. And there may be to some a certain appeal to the notion. Imagine the quiet, the calm, the serenity, if everyone stayed indoors for a few weeks. Or, alternatively, the domestic disputes, disorder and dysfunction when cabin fever peaks.

Many of my former Georgetown neighbors in Washington are being asked to self-quarantine after discovering that the rector of Christ Church was unknowingly infected as he shook hundreds of parishioners’ hands over the past couple of weeks. Some of those congregants are well within the designated demographic — we’ll call them older — that covid-19 can hit hard.

The latest entry in the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s advice column is that people over 60 should “stock up,” in case they’re forced to stay home for a long period, and to avoid crowds. But stocking up means what, exactly? And how much is enough? Naturally, I’ve made my list. For some reason, I thought ramen noodles should be on it, though I’ve never bought them before. Other items not usually in my cart — a gallon jug of Clorox, popsicles and saltines. One might think I was planning to get sick.

But do I do the shopping myself or order online? Am I being ridiculously paranoid or sensibly cautious? The constant media coverage, for which we are alternately grateful and resentful, begins to feel like an invitation to hysteria. Given that hand sanitizers and masks are out of stock everywhere, I’m buying 190-proof alcohol and glycerin to make my own sanitizer and avoid the busy checkout lines. Down South, of course, pollen coats everything, which is making lots of people cough and sneeze without having the bug.

The order of the day, then: Wash those hands, per usual. Check on your elderly neighbors, as we should anyway. Be prepared, but don’t panic. But even that message kindles paranoia. Or worse: some eye-rolling. In South Carolina, where I’m holed up at an undisclosed location, I’ve heard several people call the virus scare a nuisance to be ignored. With President Trump, normally a germaphobe, still shaking hands and promising that everything is just fine, it’s little wonder that some are skeptical.

My view is different: hope for the best, prepare for the worst.

And, no matter what, keep plenty of duct tape on hand. It’s more comfortable than you might think."

\*\*Beginning Text\*\*

There’s an old brain teaser that goes like this: You have a pond of a certain size, and upon that pond, a single lilypad. This particular species of lily pad reproduces once a day, so that on day two, you have two lily pads. On day three, you have four, and so on.

Now the teaser. “If it takes the lily pads 48 days to cover the pond completely, how long will it take for the pond to be covered halfway?”

The answer is 47 days. Moreover, at day 40, you’ll barely know the lily pads are there.

That grim math explains why so many people — including me — are worried about the novel coronavirus, which causes a disease known as covid-19. And why so many other people think we are panicking over nothing.

How things are scary now, just wait six months down the line when there are mass layoffs. We talked about how the price of literally everything has gone up, like rent (which he called satanic (based)) and food - he pointed out how in 2008 dollar menus were still a thing. 

We talked about how 90% of Americans are loaded with debt, and what the fuck are they (meaning we) gonna do when a stalled economy keeps stalling and people lose their jobs AND have to pay for basic necessities. It was really depressing hearing the serious fear in this guy's voice and only being able to nod along and say, uh yeah dude, you're fucking right, I work in fundraising that is reliant on stocks (grantwriting (kill me)), I'm honestly scared for my job too.

Interestingly, he said he doesn't give a shit about the coronavirus because what's it gonna do, kill a couple old people? That's a drop in the bucket and we're looking at a possible depression that will destroy peoples' lives.

Bully yang pertama sudah nonjok kamu ratusan kali selama 12 tahun kamu sekolah. Kamu tahu trik2 supaya kamu tidak dipukul dan trik supaya guru bisa bantu kamu hadapin itu bully.

Bully yang kedua baru pindahan 3 bulan yang lalu, namun kerjaan dia tiap hari ngehajar kamu. Tipe mukulnya beda dengan bully pertama, dan trik2 yang kamu pakai buat bully pertama ga semuanya bisa bantu hadapin bully kedua, dan guru karena ini bully masih anak baru belum tahu bagaimana bagusnya hadapin itu bully.

Nah bully mana yang lebih berbahaya. Also, sebenarnya kamu bisa nge-gym karate buat hadapin bully pertama namun sayangnya bully kedua itu gayanya MMA, dan belum ada klub MMA di kotamu.

Also, yang bilang flu ga berbahaya mesti di infeksi pakai influenza virus kalau dia udah umur 50an, let's see how harmless influenza will be for him. Fact: influenza is dangerous for children and the elderly and any people with immunocompromised. That's why if you are freaking have a Flu, stay away from children and the elderly and wear a mask you sick sunovagum. Influenza virus is dangerous so is Coronavirus. You know that the number of death if previous pandemics? Spanish influenza in 1918 (17–100 million deaths), Asian influenza in 1957 (two million deaths), Hong Kong influenza in 1968 (one million deaths), 2009 Swine Flu (575000), even normal flu season have 600000 mortalities per year. Influenza virus is a killer and saying that Coronavirus is like influenza virus is a compliment not an underestimation.

TLDR: You don't underestimate influenza virus and the new Coronavirus, they are both cold and hardened killers and they are out there! They can't be bargained with. They can't be reasoned with. They doesn't feel pity, or remorse, or fear! And they absolutely will not stop replicating, ever, and you might be dead while they doing it!"

> Graduate and professional students involved in individual rotations or doing individual research may continue their programs but must limit travel and group activities consistent with our other policies.

> We are tightening our policies for group events to prohibit all nonessential events of more than 100 people, on and off campus, even when they include only members of the Cornell community.

We must not panic, but we must not expose our fellow citizens to possible danger"" - was appealed in Tuesday's message by President Andrzej Duda.

In a message broadcast by all major Polish TV stations, President Duda said that the situation is serious due to thousands of deaths caused by coronavirus in the world. ""The virus has also reached Poland in recent days. We were expecting it. We know that the number of people infected will increase in the coming days. I assure you that the authorities of the Republic of Poland have already taken the appropriate steps to prepare for this challenge."" - said the president.

""Now, necessary, decisive action is being taken to protect the Poles as effectively as possible. Sanitary checks have been introduced at the borders of our country. A decision has been made to ban mass events. In the next few days, further necessary steps will be taken"" - he added.

The President assured that Polish authorities want to prevent infections and protect people. He stressed that he is in constant contact with the Prime Minister, the head of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the head of the Ministry of Interior. ""The government and local government administration, sanitary, medical, police, fire brigade, border guards, army, work with dedication to protect Poles. I highly appreciate the actions taken in this case and thank you very much for them"". - stressed Andrzej Duda.

""Fighting the coronavirus has no political colours.""

The President appealed for understanding of the authorities' actions in connection with the coronavirus epidemic, and for all recommendations issued by the services to be closely followed.

""While appealing for calm and common sense, let us also remember, taught by the experiences of other countries, that the matter is serious. It must not be underestimated. The coronavirus is not just a government matter. It's a matter for all of us. It's a matter for every Pole today. - said the president, emphasizing that it is the rulers who bear the greatest responsibility in connection with the epidemic.

He reminded that at his request, a special session of the Sejm was held in connection with the coronavirus, and on Tuesday a meeting of the National Security Council was held so that - as he said - the government and the opposition could talk together about ways to ensure the safety of Poles. He also thanked all participants in the meeting of the NSC for ""constructive dialogue"" and the opposition for ""responsible attitude"".

""The fight against the coronavirus has no political colours. Fighting it is our common task and duty"". - stressed Andrzej Duda.

""We must not panic.""

He also called for responsible behaviour.

""In an emergency, responsible behaviour is important. We must not panic, but we must not expose our fellow citizens to possible danger. Let us remember that. Therefore, as president, I ask all my countrymen, all citizens, that in the face of the coronavirus threat, we remember that only by acting together can we effectively fight it.

The Waffle House Index is an informal metric used by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to determine the effect of a storm and the likely scale of assistance required for disaster recovery.

If you get there and the Waffle House is closed? That's really bad... 



The measure is based on the reputation of Waffle House for having good disaster preparedness and staying open during extreme weather, or reopening quickly afterwards.

Another difference: The mouse coronavirus is usually not lethal, but for mice lacking Ly6e, it was deadly.

However :

Because LY6E is a naturally occurring protein in humans, we hope this knowledge may help in the development of therapies that might one day be used to treat coronavirus infections.""

I’ve read a few articles that explain the psychology behind panic buying but I haven’t seen anything that actually isolates why TP is the white ticket item.

This craze appears to have begun in Australia, then herd mentality followed as we began to see low shelf stock, pictures were being posted, media coverage instigated fear then international coverage on our strange choice of stockpiling sparked a world wide trend.

The same advice is being echoed over and over to try to stem this unusual stockpiling.

Toilet paper will not protect you from Coronavirus.
We will not run out of toilet paper.

This is not why toilet paper is flying off the shelf, so this advice is not working.

Australia has just come off the back of an extreme bushfire season.
It was traumatic and still very fresh in our mind.

Many of us evacuated with little in the way of supplies, many were evacuated from their evacuation safe zones once or twice, perpetually trying to out run this out of control event that was threatening lives and lively hoods. 

It lasted months, not days, not weeks... months!

Some of us were prepared, some of us were not. We shared what we could but access was a real issue, even with so many people working together.

We are not used to preparing for emergencies, we are a pretty laid back bunch “she’ll be right”.

I was fortunate, despite fires raging to the north south and east of our town, I was packed and ready but we didn’t need to leave.

It was scary though.

Not feeling in control of our situation I set about trying to maintain some semblance of control.
We discussed escape plans, when we would leave, who we would check in with.
We prepared our home, filled the cars, packed a variety of food, water, med kits, smoke masks, fire blankets, toy boxes, clothes, important documents, sentimental items, and 1 toilet roll in each car... what was I thinking!

Thousands of people spent long periods either on the run or trapped in dangerous places with little to no access to basic goods, 1 toilet roll was not going cut it if we ended up in the same position.

So, coming directly off the back of a traumatic period, still nursing our wounds and remembering how much control we lost and how we couldn’t even wipe our scared butts because toilet paper was the one thing we didn’t think to pack a plentiful supply of and we had limited access to even obtain said rolls, what do you expect us to do to try to reclaim some sense of control of our butts?

Stockpile the one thing we all missed while dealing with our crisis.

Why we are hearing it won’t protect us from the virus is beyond me, this is not why we are stockpiling.

The fact that we won’t run out of toilet paper is a little more reasonable, but again does not address why we are doing it so that advice will not help.

We are afraid of becoming isolated and that is not being addressed, at all.

We have just been through terrifying isolation and even the most coordinated efforts were not able to bring enough supplies when they were needed.

How are we going to access food, medicine, and the coveted toilet paper if we are told to isolate or our towns enter lockdown.

We don’t know what isolation looks like for us in the face of a pandemic.
How will supplies be made available to us if our towns are in lockdown?
Will deliveries of stock still be allowed in? Who will even be willing to make that delivery?
How will supplies be made available to us if we are ordered into home isolation?
Will online deliveries for anyone with a positive test be made a priority so we don’t go a week without?
And what about the casual workers who won’t have money to buy supplies if they become isolated? Will there be a package to assist them?

If our real concerns were addressed rather than floating advice that is as absurd as our panic buying appears to be then maybe we would calm down a little because we will feel secure that our country has a plan to maintain control after so months we have already faced feeling out of control."

 And health care…..  as unwanted as this coronavirus is, my feeling is this is a very likely tipping point. Just think about this: the caregivers who help the elderly & infirm – the people who may die from virus – work at min wage with no health insurance. Just think about a low-wage hourly worker with no insurance who comes to work feeling sick because he has no option, and then everyone at workplace gets it and their parents get it etc etc. Lists like these are endless.

My personal guess is that the number is in the dozens because 3 is the number of CAUGHT cases and almost no one who has normal cold/flu symptoms is getting tested. Just look around campus and see how many people are coughing/sneezing and are feeling down.

True I’m speculating anecdotally, but my point is not everyone is getting tested, and 80% of cases are mild so for some it could be a very minor ordeal that lasts 3 days but they’ll be spreading it in the meantime. The state/CDC don’t even want everyone experiencing minor or harsher symptoms to get tested or go to the doctor’s anyway, they just told everyone to stay home in isolation

TLDR; Not everyone is getting tested and lots of people seem sick right now, so the number of cases is probably way higher than 3 considering 80% of cases are mild."

> •	Winter Quarter final exams will be offered remotely. Instructors are asked to communicate with students how final exams, if applicable, will be offered without the need to assemble in person (for example, take home, online or other alternative formats).
> •	Students are encouraged to start the Spring Quarter remotely from home. University housing will remain open through Spring Break and beyond for those who need it.
> •	We’re transitioning over the next few days to cancel nonessential gatherings of more than 100 people.
> •	Campus remains open, including housing, hospitals, clinics and research laboratories.
> •	We will be in touch before April 10 as facts change and we reevaluate these plans.

> If you are a student or faculty member and have specific questions or concerns, reach out to your department chair or dean. Schools will communicate more specific guidance and information, building on our plan for academic continuity. If you are an employee, please contact your manager and further guidance will be forthcoming. Please continue to check UCLA’s dedicated COVID-19 website for updates.
> I know this raises a lot of questions about courses, like performance courses, that are difficult to teach remotely and, for our staff who support campus operations, what their roles will look like. We understand there will be questions around many issues. Please be assured that answers and additional information will be forthcoming over the next few days.
> 
> Our new policy regarding nonessential in-person events with more than 100 people will mean that organizers must work toward canceling conferences and large events through April 10. Attendance at all UCLA Athletics home events will be largely spectator-free through April 10 and limited to individuals essential to safely and effectively managing events.
> 
> I know these changes may cause some stress and uncertainty. Please bear with us while we manage this complicated transition. Counseling services are available for students through UCLA’s Counseling and Psychological Services. Staff and faculty may seek services at the Staff and Faculty Counseling Center. If you develop flu-like symptoms — fever, cough and difficulty breathing — and are concerned that you may have been exposed to COVID-19, seek medical attention. Students should call the Ashe Center Infection Control Line at 310-206-6217 and faculty and staff should call their health care providers. Please always call ahead before arriving.
> 
> Students: I know you will miss your friends and all of the activities you enjoy on campus. I want to thank you in advance for your cooperation, flexibility and academic integrity during this time. Please read more online about resources available to you.
> 
> Faculty: I know these transitions will require you to transform how you deliver instruction and conduct final exams. Please know that we will work to provide the support and training you need to make this change as smooth as possible. Watch the Academic Senate homepage for further guidance.
> 
> Staff: Please work with your supervisors to be flexible in these uncertain times and know that additional information about business continuity will be provided. You can find the UC Office of the President updated leave policy (PDF) online.
> 
> And, finally, for our entire community, please also remember that COVID-19 is clearly going to disrupt and change our schedules, habits and lives for the foreseeable future. This will not be a perfect transition; however, it will not change who we are and what we do. It will also never compromise UCLA’s impact in our community and the broader world. How we react and work together in times like these help define who we are, and I have no doubt that the Bruin community will once again rise to the occasion as we transition to our second century.

*By Tom Bossert*

March 9, 2020 at 5:04 PM EDT

*This column has been updated.*

*Tom Bossert served as homeland security adviser to President Trump from 2017 to 2018.*

The first phase of the coronavirus outbreak was a domestic challenge for China and a border containment one for the United States and others. Now we are in the second phase: community mitigation. Math and history must guide our next steps.

The near-term objective should be to reduce the acute, exponential growth of the outbreak, in order to reduce suffering and the strain on our health-care system. That will require significant effort, but it can work, as we have seen: Hong Kong and Singapore have achieved linear growth of covid-19 cases, staving off the terrifying exponential upward curve confronting Italy and pushing both the infection rate down and new cases out on the timeline.

The United States needs to take note.

This virus is such a threat because it is both highly infectious and lethal, and not enough people are being tested, despite significant recent effort by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. By the time cases are confirmed, significant community transmission has likely already occurred. This is a classic tip-of-the-iceberg phenomenon. It’s also akin to looking at a star; the light we see today was emitted some time ago. But the most useful comparison now is to a fire that threatens to burn out of control. It is one we can still contain, even extinguish — if we act.

The best way to put out the fire is a vaccine, but that is over a year away. In the meantime, we must focus on reducing the height of the outbreak curve. This requires coordination and implementation of non-pharmaceutical interventions. School closures, isolation of the sick, home quarantines of those who have come into contact with the sick, social distancing, telework and large-gathering cancellations must be implemented before the spread of the disease in any community reaches 1 percent. After that, science tells us, these interventions become far less effective.

Simply put, as evidence of human-to-human transmission becomes clear in a community, officials must pull the trigger on aggressive interventions. Time matters. Two weeks of delay can mean the difference between success and failure. Public health experts learned this in 1918 when the Spanish flu killed 50 million to 100 million people around the globe. If we fail to take action, we will watch our health-care system be overwhelmed.

Starting now, public health messaging should be framed in light of this clear objective. Community-based interventions are needed to delay the outbreak peak. On this, the 1918 flu taught us a lot. The difference between the steps taken in Philadelphia, which waited too long back then, and St. Louis, which acted quickly, is staggering. Aggressive interventions put off and ease the peak burden on hospitals and other health-care infrastructure. Ultimately, these measures can also diminish the overall number of cases and health impacts.

Consider the actions taken in Italy. On Feb. 20, Italy reported three instances of infection and no known deaths. On Feb. 21, Italy had 20 cases and its first attributed death. Officials implemented interventions, including school closures, the following day and instituted a cordon sanitaire affecting 50,000 people. That’s aggressive, but it was too late. On Feb. 22, Italy reported 63 cases and a second death. A little more than a week later, there were 2,036 cases, with 140 patients in serious condition and 52 deaths. Today, the numbers continue to climb, with more than 9,100 cases and 460 dead, and on Monday the government expanded travel restrictions to the entire country.

By contrast, Hong Kong and Singapore acted immediately and are still holding the line, literally. Through isolation, quarantines, contact tracing, canceled gatherings and widespread surveillance, they have achieved linear growth of the virus, meaning a reproduction number close to one. What they are doing is working.

Working parents without child care have a legitimate concern, and we must find ways to help one another. But school closings can be the single most effective intervention. Amid an influenza pandemic, schools would be closed to protect the students themselves. Because children are not among the groups most vulnerable to coronavirus, schools should be closed in an effort to reduce community transmission and to protect the children’s parents and grandparents. How long? Epidemiologists suggest eight weeks might be needed to arrest this outbreak. Administrators, students, teachers and parents need to get busy figuring out how to continue the education of our children while contributing to this community-wide public health effort.

The United States and other liberal societies must mount a significant, coordinated response with public buy-in. Panic must, of course, be avoided. Most people who become infected are likely to get what feels like a mild case of seasonal flu. Many will not develop symptoms. But the elderly and otherwise infirm are at risk, and the number of Americans likely to be hospitalized and the subset of those who will require some form of critical care could still be significant.

The rates will be worse if the disease is not aggressively countered early. But I know we can all work together for the greater good."

People aren't traveling as much (or at all in those countries), which is fucking with OPEC's production and bottom line; which is fucking with the markets because Saudi Arabia and Russia got into a pissing contest over disagreements; Which caused the rest of the markets to drop the sharpest rate since the 2008 *Great Recession*. Tangentially, the Federal Reserve dropped the interest rate to hopefully get people moving money confidently a week before the OPEC influenced run on the markets. So that Fed change is probably a bit vain right now, though ""nice"" once the recovery period begins... whenever that will be.

But no, Trump insists all is well, the markets are fine and people are fine. Because to Trump, ""market strength = approval rating"" which directly impacts his re-election bid (which is all the Chucklefuck in Chief cares about: how COVID affects *him*). Trump reminds me of [Greg Marmalard in Animal House.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zDAmPIq29ro) Speaking of Trump, ""did you know Influenza has killed more people than COVID-19?"" *Clearly* there's nothing to worry about when the less-deadly flu bug kills people... his gross misunderstanding of percentages and vaccines is a huge problem right now.

Oh and Coronavirus testing kits in the states are wayyy behind other countries. We've tested ~1500 people while the UK (less than 1/5th our size) has tested over 20,000 people. *That* is a legit problem, and we're slow on the uptake. I'm not considering the medical costs and financial impacts on people given our health insurance system specifically because insurers are waiving the costs. The problem is we don't have testing kits, which makes it harder to track the bug and quarantine the bug should the need arise.

In an era where we need doctors to tell us what's up, where people want & need accurate information from the CDC... listening to the President of the United States downplay the bug and contradict his VP's task force is incredibly frustrating. I didn't think anything would piss me off more than the impeachment proceedings... you'd think I'd have learned better by now that this presidency finds new ways to fuck with us. :/

'We are 10 days away from the hospitals getting creamed,' warns former homeland security adviser The U.S. is a little more than a week away from a health care crisis related to the new coronavirus, according to the man who once advised President Donald Trump on how to respond to pandemics.

""We are 10 days from the hospitals getting creamed,” Tom Bossert, who was Trump’s homeland security adviser until he was ousted in 2018, told NBC News. **Bossert was never replaced, and Trump eliminated the national security council jobs related to disease outbreaks.**

In an op-ed in The Washington Post published Monday, Bossert said that unless the U.S. closes schools, halts public gatherings and takes other steps to reduce community transmission, the country is headed for the sort of crisis Italy is now facing, with hospitals overwhelmed by elderly people in need of critical care.

“Simply put, as evidence of human-to-human transmission becomes clear in a community, officials must pull the trigger on aggressive interventions,” Bossert wrote. “Time matters. Two weeks of delay can mean the difference between success and failure. Public health experts learned this in 1918 when the Spanish flu killed 50 million to 100 million people around the globe. If we fail to take action, we will watch our health-care system be overwhelmed.”"

Swap ""feelings"" for ""political ideologies"" and make the arbitrary distinction be closeness to the Overton window and you're there. Jreg is currently being drawn towards that (overlay of son with coronavirus towards the end), but per the father's advice, that ideology is changeable, and as he learns to create art through this framework, he learns to create art in general. Eventually he'll drop the schtick and move onto something else as he becomes closer to reaching self-actualization, where the ""meta-modern man"" fades in the face of beauty and simply becomes a man (I fucked up that quote but there you go), but for now he's gonna keep producing his current political content.

Just the beginning of virus, it will be 10-15 times worse than flu.

Based on the data so far estimate there will be 48million hospitalisations, 96million cases, over 480,000 deaths in America

Will last atleast 3-6months.

Smoking, obesity and high blood pressure increase risk.

Number of cases seem to double every four days.

In the first hours of contracting there are incredibly high levels of the virus making you infectious before any symptoms show.

Kids are not getting sick from it. In China only 2% under the age of 18.

30% of nurses in America have kids(Whose going to look after them if they close schools), One quarter of Americans don’t have sick leave.

690,000 Americans have end stage renal disease get their drugs from China. Most of the drugs come from China.

No evidence this is a bioweapon.

No evidence Virus is seasonal.

Influenza transmission is like “trying to stop the wind”, isolation won’t stop it, only a vaccine.

No data anything can fight the virus besides factors that improve your immune system (exercise,good sleep, not missing medication)

Hand sanitizer is good for stopping a lot of infectious diseases but weak evidence that this virus will be transmitted that way(through hands,face) but should still use it. People want to feel like they’re doing something by washing their hands, the data says it is transmitted by breathing.

Surgical mask not effective at all from stopping virus from getting in. They were made for stopping bugs going out. N95 respirator mask are very effective.

Over 4,000 health workers in China infected. We have to protect our health workers, they are on the front line who cannot be replaced.

There might have been a vaccine for coronavirus if after SARS and MERS in 2003 everyone continued to find a vaccine but after it went away nobody had interest.

He did a Briefing with over 400 major financial investors around the world they reminded him of a scared child, he’s worried for the market, no plans in place again for this virus.

Have to prioritise a vaccine.

He predicted in his book that a virus would come out of China because of the large population and food supply that is largely wild life that comes into the markets, close contact with the animals, bugs on animals. China has been a “bacterial and viral soup vessel for a long time”


A vaccine will most likely take years, there was an antibody dependent enhancement component to SARS (A little bit of the antibody actually made you more sick)"

But it carries an abnormal risk to enter the country."" used expressions. On the other hand, Minister Koca announced that President Recep Tayyip Erdogan may issue a circular so that public personnel cannot go abroad unless it is compulsory.

Stating that a circular, which is updated and prepared to be prepared, is published every year in the Official Gazette, ""I am talking about a general pandemic board where all ministries and related units are in line with what is planned and what should be done in September-October. . All provinces had made all preparations for the evaluation meeting on 24-25 September 2019 and the action plan. this, in any case of an outbreak that may be unrelated to the choir with a plan of action plans to Turkey What should I do. "" he spoke.

Koca also said that the World Health Organization's Chinese office reported the first case of pneumonia in Wuhan on December 31, and that they quickly created an operation center with 15 people in Public Health on January 6, and started to follow the usual developments instantly. He also stated that they have activated the Scientific Committee, and also expanded the board in the process.

Husband also reminded that this epidemic started in the city of Kum and Mashhad, and stated the following statements:

We have seen that we have a very intense relationship and traffic with Iran. If these strict rules were not applied at that time, if only 3 days were delayed, the number of people to enter would not be less than 20 thousand. Currently one of the official 3 in Tehran Considering that infected as well, he would have entered Turkey with these secretions much of the 20 thousand people, quickly how to deploy, how it will affect the country Guess you. ""

Stating that Italy does not take measures on coronavirus in general , and Europe does not cut its relations with Italy, Koca insists that ""It is too late to take European measures. It is still late, I insist. It has not taken any precautions, it has not restricted any passage. Every day Europe We see that the number is rising in. Increasingly, this number has also started to increase in the Scandinavian countries. Italy is experiencing a big problem now, but Germany will have a bigger problem in the coming days, France will have a bigger problem, and in other countries, including Switzerland, this problem will be increasing. "" used expressions.

Her husband, the head of the commission Senel Yediyıldız ""There is no such outbreaks in Turkey,"" also said, he said:

""I hope so. This pandemic is currently likely to be in Turkey is very high. At the moment we can only say that this virus is not able to be determined. There are of us close to 100 people in this hall, jaundice or not as accurate as what I also do not have hepatitis carriers, If I have to say this by conducting an examination, in the same way, there is no coronavirus detected in this sense, that is, it is not diagnosed and diagnosed, but this may even appear before the analysis is being made, or it may come out after 3 hours a day. This is the reality. We have people who go abroad intensely. Who can say that they did not get the infection from there and did not come into contact with the person who has any signs of disease. ""

Stating that the problem is global but the struggle is national, Koca stated that this global problem can only be solved with the citizen.

Andrew M. Cuomo of New York on Tuesday announced a targeted containment strategy to halt the spread of the virus.

The state’s plan focuses on a “containment area” in New Rochelle with a one-mile radius centered around a synagogue believed to be at the center of the cluster, officials said.

Schools and other large gathering facilities like community centers and houses of worship within the area will be closed for two weeks beginning on Thursday, Mr. Cuomo said. Businesses such as grocery stores and delis would remain open. The state did not plan to close streets or implement travel restrictions, he said.

“You’re not containing people,” he said. “You’re containing facilities.”

The state also planned to deploy the National Guard to the containment area to clean the schools and deliver food to quarantined residents, Mr. Cuomo said.

The cluster in Westchester County first came to the authorities’ attention last week, when a lawyer who lives in New Rochelle and works in Manhattan, Lawrence Garbuz, became the second person in New York to be diagnosed with coronavirus last week."

In this [New York Times article](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/04/health/coronavirus-china-aylward.html) (put a period after the .com in the address and you can read it through the paywall), a man who works for the World Health Organization explains the things China did right & how they have begun reducing the amount of daily confirmed cases, and one of the major points is the prevalence of wearing face masks. 

In the US, face masks are not a common thing when people get sick - unlike in Asia. There are many, many fewer masks available here, in part because of that. Most households don't normally have masks as home, like a lot of households in Asia might. Also, China and other Asian countries have already been experiencing shortages in the last couple months because of the coronavirus, so there are potentially even fewer masks available for the US. If authorities told everyone to wear masks, it would become apparent very quickly that there are not enough and that would really scare people. Also, many mask production facilities are located in China and are struggling to meet demand because so much of the Chinese population is either sick or under quarantine. There are a lot of complicated aspects about masks shortages (having to do with economics & governments managing people and markets) and that results in some authorities claiming that masks don't really help. 

The bottom line is they DO help, either by PREVENTING people from touching their nose/mouth because there's a thing on their face so it raises their awareness, or by actually blocking/catching viruses - that's why they are used my medical personnel, that's why they have been being used heavily in Asia, that's why they are in high demand, that's why there are shortages, etc. etc. 

There is a lot of conflicting information out there, for various reasons. People in positions of authority sometimes value preventing potential panic and economic hardships over spreading safety awareness. Other people truly believe the misinformation they spread because they are scared or in denial and unable to face the realities of what's going on. Other people just have their hands full trying to live their lives and can't even think about this stuff, and they feel validated to read, share, spread incorrect information. 

I hope this helps. I can provide more links if you'd like to look at credible sources confirming this stuff. My husband is a researcher and has been eyeball deep in this stuff for the last several weeks.

Edit: I also want to say good on you for taking this seriously and taking your health and your community seriously. I felt compelled to write a reply to you because I see myself in your words - wanting to understand things, seeking the truth, wanting to protect yourself, wanting to be open to whatever the truth may be.

It’s *still important* even if it isn’t enough (and was never enough) by itself. In the US people don’t as often cough or sneeze without covering their mouth (as in Asia) or kiss each other hello (like in much of Europe). We sneeze/cough into our hands and we are a handshake culture, on top of that research shows that washing hands reduces your chances of contracting respiratory illnesses in general.

Not saying it’s enough. It isn’t. But anything we can encourage people to do to prevent the spread even a little bit slows the rate at which hospitals are going to be overwhelmed or people are going to die for lack of treatment.

We won’t know because we aren’t testing, we may have already surpassed it overall but we’re a bigger country. I wouldn’t be surprised though if we had a growth rate more like Germany’s 20% (which is still rapidly unsustainable). It’s already been circulating here since January.

The plan has been approved by the Faculty Senate. 

The first marker is when there is one confirmed case of COVID-19 in Broome County (not on campus). At that point, faculty are encouraged to move to an online format for instruction. Staff will be expected to report to work as usual and buildings, including residence halls will remain open and accessible. All campus operations including classes will continue as usual.

The second marker is when one confirmed case of COVID-19 is confirmed among Binghamton faculty, staff, or students or there is significant increase in confirmed cases in Broome County. At that point, all courses will move to an online format. Students will have the option to leave campus if they so choose. Staff will be expected to report to work as usual and buildings will remain accessible. Essential services for student housing and dining will be maintained.

The third marker will be met if Gov. Andrew Cuomo takes any action to suspend campus physical operations. All faculty will then continue to teach online, only designated critical employees will be required to come to work, and students will determine whether they remain on campus or leave.""

Anti-HIV Drug, a cure for coronavirus **?**

A combination of lopinavir and ritonavir, both second-line HIV drugs, was used on an elderly Italian couple in Jaipur undergoing treatment at the SMS Hospital. This combination, along with other drugs, was popularly used in clinical trials in China, where the coronavirus first emerged and rampantly spread. It was also used in Thailand for treating COVID-19 patients.

The Drug Controller General of India approved the “restricted use” of these medications for treating coronavirus-affected people after the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) sought their emergency approval.

The Italian man and his wife had reportedly developed severe respiratory problems following which a decision was taken to put them on the combination. As a result, the drugs were administered after taking consent of the patients, SMS Hospital Medical Superintendent Dr DS Meena said.

I would just like to make my concern known regarding the continuation of face-to-face classes on campus and face-to-face final exams. With over a hundred confirmed cases in California and Washington each, and a case within 25 miles of Oregon State, I'm becoming very uncomfortable attending class.

Some infected individuals are asymptomatic and the incubation time for the virus exceeds a week. Further, many individuals who are sick are not necessarily being tested for Coronavirus.

I fear that physical final exams and continuation of classes may facilitate rapid spread of the virus, and that once a case is confirmed, it has already spread.

I can only hope that Oregon State intends to handle a potential outbreak proactively."

>March 9, 2020 at 5:04 p.m. EDT

>This column has been updated.

>Tom Bossert served as homeland security adviser to President Trump from 2017 to 2018.

>The first phase of the coronavirus outbreak was a domestic challenge for China and a border containment one for the United States and others. Now we are in the second phase: community mitigation. Math and history must guide our next steps.

>The near-term objective should be to reduce the acute, exponential growth of the outbreak, in order to reduce suffering and the strain on our health-care system. That will require significant effort, but it can work, as we have seen: Hong Kong and Singapore have achieved linear growth of covid-19 cases, staving off the terrifying exponential upward curve confronting Italy and pushing both the infection rate down and new cases out on the timeline.

>The United States needs to take note.

>This virus is such a threat because it is both highly infectious and lethal, and not enough people are being tested, despite significant recent effort by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. By the time cases are confirmed, significant community transmission has likely already occurred. This is a classic tip-of-the-iceberg phenomenon. It’s also akin to looking at a star; the light we see today was emitted some time ago. But the most useful comparison now is to a fire that threatens to burn out of control. It is one we can still contain, even extinguish — if we act.

>The best way to put out the fire is a vaccine, but that is over a year away. In the meantime, we must focus on reducing the height of the outbreak curve. This requires coordination and implementation of non-pharmaceutical interventions. School closures, isolation of the sick, home quarantines of those who have come into contact with the sick, social distancing, telework and large-gathering cancellations must be implemented before the spread of the disease in any community reaches 1 percent. After that, science tells us, these interventions become far less effective.

>Simply put, as evidence of human-to-human transmission becomes clear in a community, officials must pull the trigger on aggressive interventions. Time matters. Two weeks of delay can mean the difference between success and failure. Public health experts learned this in 1918 when the Spanish flu killed 50 million to 100 million people around the globe. If we fail to take action, we will watch our health-care system be overwhelmed.

>Starting now, public health messaging should be framed in light of this clear objective. Community-based interventions are needed to delay the outbreak peak. On this, the 1918 flu taught us a lot. The difference between the steps taken in Philadelphia, which waited too long back then, and St. Louis, which acted quickly, is staggering. Aggressive interventions put off and ease the peak burden on hospitals and other health-care infrastructure. Ultimately, these measures can also diminish the overall number of cases and health impacts.

>Consider the actions taken in Italy. On Feb. 20, Italy reported three instances of infection and no known deaths. On Feb. 21, Italy had 20 cases and its first attributed death. Officials implemented interventions, including school closures, the following day and instituted a cordon sanitaire affecting 50,000 people. That’s aggressive, but it was too late. On Feb. 22, Italy reported 63 cases and a second death. A little more than a week later, there were 2,036 cases, with 140 patients in serious condition and 52 deaths. Today, the numbers continue to climb, with more than 9,100 cases and 460 dead, and on Monday the government expanded travel restrictions to the entire country.

>By contrast, Hong Kong and Singapore acted immediately and are still holding the line, literally. Through isolation, quarantines, contact tracing, canceled gatherings and widespread surveillance, they have achieved linear growth of the virus, meaning a reproduction number close to one. What they are doing is working.

>Working parents without child care have a legitimate concern, and we must find ways to help one another. But school closings can be the single most effective intervention. Amid an influenza pandemic, schools would be closed to protect the students themselves. Because children are not among the groups most vulnerable to coronavirus, schools should be closed in an effort to reduce community transmission and to protect the children’s parents and grandparents. How long? Epidemiologists suggest eight weeks might be needed to arrest this outbreak. Administrators, students, teachers and parents need to get busy figuring out how to continue the education of our children while contributing to this community-wide public health effort.

>The United States and other liberal societies must mount a significant, coordinated response with public buy-in. Panic must, of course, be avoided. Most people who become infected are likely to get what feels like a mild case of seasonal flu. Many will not develop symptoms. But the elderly and otherwise infirm are at risk, and the number of Americans likely to be hospitalized and the subset of those who will require some form of critical care could still be significant.

>The rates will be worse if the disease is not aggressively countered early. But I know we can all work together for the greater good."

# Takara Bio ramps up production of coronavirus test reagent 50-fold

Thu, 02/06/2020

KYOTO -- Takara Bio is preparing to produce 50 times more of a coronavirus testing reagent at its plant in Dalian in response to an urgent request from the Chinese city, where the Japanese drugmaker's main factory is located.

Takara Bio aims to churn out 250,000 units of the reagent per week and will supply it to 30 test kit manufacturers in 10 Chinese cities, including Wuhan, the epicenter of the outbreak.

Dalian authority informally requested Takara Bio's subsidiary to provide a ""stable supply"" of the reagent in late January. It made the request formally on Tuesday. Under special permission, Takara's main factory in Dalian continued operating through the Luner New Year holidays, with its workforce increased to 100 employees working overtime to achieve the ramped-up times more production.

With the spread of the new coronavirus, supplies of test reagents have been running short."

The people in the study had all recovered from SARS an average of 41.3 months ago when it was conducted.

It’s Not 9/11 or a Housing Crash. So What’s the Coronavirus Fiscal Playbook?

Policymakers can’t prevent economic damage from the outbreak, but they can limit it and make a quick rebound more likely.

The government can’t prevent the coronavirus from damaging the U.S. economy.

The usual tools that economic policymakers rely on, like tax cuts and stimulus spending, won’t restore canceled conferences, unclog supply chains or persuade wary consumers to go out to bars and restaurants. Even if such policies would help, they conflict with the advice of health officials who are urging “social distancing” to slow the spread of the virus.

But that doesn’t mean policymakers are powerless. Economists say well-designed programs could limit the damage and help ensure a quick rebound.

President Trump said Monday that he would meet with congressional leaders to discuss a “very substantial” payroll tax cut and other measures. Many economists are skeptical of that approach, arguing that a payroll tax cut would be too small and too poorly targeted to be of much help.

Instead, they recommended a variety of other steps, some narrowly aimed at addressing the outbreak and some intended to bolster the broader economy. One lesson from the last recession is that the government has to move quickly.
“You’ve got to go big, and you’ve got to go fast,” said Claudia Sahm, a former Federal Reserve staff member who is now director of macroeconomic policy at the Washington Center for Equitable Growth, a left-leaning research organization. “If you don’t go fast, you’re not going to short-circuit it.”

Here are some forms that such intervention could take.

Fight the disease.

The surest way to limit the economic damage, of course, is to limit the spread of the disease itself. That is mostly the responsibility of health officials. But policymakers can take steps to make the job easier, said Jay Shambaugh, director of the Hamilton Project, an economic policy arm of the Brookings Institution.

The federal government, for example, could offer to cover some of the Medicaid costs that states usually bear. That would make it easier for states — which, unlike the federal government, generally must balance their budgets each year — to respond forcefully to the virus. It would also make it less likely that states would have to raise taxes or cut programs to pay for coronavirus spending, which could further damage the economy.

“The front lines in all of this is going to be at the state level, and so anything we can do to free up their budgets a little bit will help,” Mr. Shambaugh said. “You want to make sure the states aren’t making choices that are fiscally constrained.”

More generally, Mr. Shambaugh and others said, the federal government should spend whatever it takes to address the outbreak. Yields on government bonds have fallen to record lows in recent days, meaning the government can borrow money at little cost.
Cushion the blow.

The early stages of the coronavirus outbreak have had an acute impact on a relatively narrow set of industries and places. Airlines are warning of huge losses. Cruise operators are reeling. Restaurants are losing business in cities with substantial outbreaks, or where large events have been called off.

There are clear humanitarian reasons for helping the people who will lose jobs or income because of the outbreak. But there are also economic reasons. The clearest way for the virus to cause a recession is for the impact to spread beyond directly affected sectors, as people who lose jobs are forced to cut spending, leading to further job losses. Government programs could help prevent that.

“What a fiscal stimulus can do is try to erect firewalls as much as possible and try to make sure it doesn’t ripple out and affect the rest of the economy,” said Josh Bivens, director of research for the Economic Policy Institute, a progressive think tank.

Those programs could take various forms. Mr. Trump on Monday floated the idea of offering loans through the Small Business Administration to affected businesses, something that economists said could help minimize layoffs and keep companies from going out of business. The Federal Reserve on Monday also indicated it would allow banks to be flexible with customers if they fell behind on loan payments because of virus-related disruptions.

Adam S. Posen, president of the Peterson Institute for International Economics, likened the situation to the financial freeze-up after the collapse of Lehman Brothers in 2008. Back then, the Fed provided liquidity so that financial institutions could ride out the crisis. The federal government could play a similar role now.

“You got a bunch of people, small businesses — particularly in retail, transportation, hospitality, tourism — that are going to be temporarily disrupted and might go out of business and shed jobs, but that’s only because of this one-time shock,” Mr. Posen said. “So fiscal policy should be the bridge to get them over that shock.”

Other programs could focus on individuals. The unemployment insurance system, for example, generally requires people to be actively searching for work to receive benefits, something that could be difficult if they are quarantined or are avoiding in-person interactions. Food stamps and other anti-poverty programs have work requirements, meaning people can lose benefits if they don’t work enough hours. Waiving or changing those rules could help people affected by the virus, and support efforts to contain the outbreak by making it easier for people exposed to the virus to stay home from work.
Stimulate the broader economy.

The trouble with carefully tailored stimulus efforts is that they could take time to design and carry out, and might not reach all the affected people and industries. Airlines and cruise operators are easy to identify, but it is harder to identify the Uber driver in Austin, Texas, who lost out on business when the South by Southwest conference was canceled, or the coffee cart owner in Midtown Manhattan who is suffering because people are working from home.

“Lots of people will be affected in lots of ways, and you can’t find them quite as perfectly as you’d like,” said Jason Furman, who led the Council of Economic Advisers under President Barack Obama.

Mr. Furman, in a Wall Street Journal opinion piece last week, proposed an immediate, one-time payment of $1,000 to every adult, plus $500 for every child. For families hurt by the virus, such payments would provide a cash infusion to help cover rent, food and other costs, without having to determine exactly who those people are.

That kind of broad-based program would also serve as a stimulus, helping to kick-start the economy once the outbreak passed. Targeted programs aren’t big enough to affect the overall economy, but a program like the one Mr. Furman is proposing — he estimated the cost of it and some other stimulus proposals at $350 billion — would be.

Stimulus efforts like Mr. Furman’s are an established part of economic firefighting. President George W. Bush tried a similar, albeit somewhat smaller, cash rebate program in 2008.

But not all economists are convinced that such a program makes sense when the damage is still unclear. Despite the turmoil in financial markets, there has been almost no hard data suggesting an economic collapse.

Michael R. Strain, an economist at the American Enterprise Institute, a conservative think tank, said Congress could pass a stimulus now that would take effect only if economic indicators showed signs of trouble.
“We don’t know what the impact of this is,” Mr. Strain said. “We don’t know what the impact is going to be. And we aren’t in a situation where our only choice is to act today or not to act at all. That’s just not the choice.”

Glenn Hubbard, a Columbia University economist who led the Council of Economic Advisers under Mr. Bush, said the biggest economic damage so far had been to confidence. The best remedy for that, he said, would be for the government to make clear that it was ready to act to support the economy if necessary. He suggested a long-term infrastructure program, something that both parties have supported in the past and that would be comparatively inexpensive given low interest rates.

“You want to persuade businesspeople that demand isn’t going to go off a cliff,” Mr. Hubbard said. “You need to make a commitment that demand will be there and will continue to be there.”

What about payroll taxes?

In his comments to reporters on Monday, Mr. Trump highlighted a different way to put cash in consumers’ pockets: a payroll tax cut. That approach has been tried in the past, including under Mr. Obama.

Studies conducted since the financial crisis, however, have found that small, gradual tax cuts were less effective at stimulating the economy than larger lump-sum payments. Consumers are more likely to spend a one-time windfall, these studies have found. And crucially for forestalling a recession, they are more likely to spend it right away, when the economy needs the boost.

“Whatever they’re going to spend out of the $1,000, you want them to spend it now,” said Ms. Sahm of the Washington Center for Equitable Growth.

The most imminent threat to the economy, she said, is that people start to worry they will lose their jobs and pull back on spending as a result. A few extra dollars in each paycheck won’t change that calculus. A larger lump sum might.
“That would be the bigger problem right now, is people just stop buying cars and washing machines,” she said. “You give them money, and they will spend it.”

There are other potential downsides to a payroll tax cut as well. Because the payroll tax is calculated as a percentage of earnings, the biggest tax cuts would go to people who need the money the least. And people who lose their jobs or whose hours are cut to zero wouldn’t get any benefit."

**All countries are on the same path when they don't adopt effective countermeasures.**  All of Europe is on its way to Italy, on the same growth path. We're all Italy, in a few weeks.

# We can stop it but it won't be easy

The only measures that we know work right now is **social distancing** [here's a great article on the Atlantic about it](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2020/03/coronavirus-cancel-everything/607675/). **Without social distancing, the spread of the virus does not slow.** That means closing schools and universities, gyms, cinemas, football games. Working from home. In South Korea and China wearing masks is either mandatory or encouraged because it stops the asymptomatic from spreading it.

[South Korea has stopped the growth curve.](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/fggo6d/new_sarscov2_cases_in_south_korea_continue_to/)

China has stopped it - with some very drastic measures - [this is a (confirmed) testimony  from someone living in Shanghai during the outbreak.](https://www.reddit.com/r/China_Flu/comments/febv3t/what_its_like_in_china_0306/)

Both China and South Korea implemented a ""foursquare"" type system for covid19. Every time you went to a public location, you would either login or be tracked. If anyone was later tested positive and you were in the same place, you got notified. This helped with keeping people informed and detecting even mild cases. [BBC Report on China system](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-51439401). [Report on Korean system - the BBC knocks it on privacy, but it worked](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-51733145)

They also had widespread use of hand disinfectant all over public places.

**There is no reason I can see not to implement the same systems here. It would stop the growth of the virus and we have the evidence it works.**

# But I'm young? My case will be mild?

Most people get symptomatic. Asymptomatic is usually a temporary condition.

Source - [a WHO doctor who was part of the mission to China.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/04/health/coronavirus-china-aylward.html)

>Many people are asymptomatic when tested, but develop symptoms within a day or two.

Most people have ""mild"" cases, but mild cases might not mean what you think.

>“Mild” was a positive test, fever, cough — maybe even pneumonia, but not needing oxygen. “Severe” was breathing rate up and oxygen saturation down, so needing oxygen or a ventilator. “Critical” was respiratory failure or multi-organ failure.

**Most infected are ""mild"". Mild cases are a really bad flu to pneumonia. You just don't REQUIRE hospitalization, because you can survive outside of a hospital and the beds are needed.**

[20% of people go into severe condition - That means 1 in 5 people have to be hospitalised. - WHO report](https://www.reddit.com/r/China_Flu/comments/fbt49e/the_who_sent_25_international_experts_to_china/)

[SARS-like virus also can have long-term consequences](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41413-020-0084-5). And then there's the potential of suffering - Here's the report of healthy 25-year-old nonsmoker who felt like he was going to suffocate [from the virus](https://news.sky.com/story/fighting-coronavirus-one-of-the-first-british-sufferers-describes-his-ordeal-11950631).

>By the afternoon, I feel like I am suffocating. I have never been this ill in my life. I can’t take more than sips of air and, when I breathe out, my lungs sound like a paper bag being crumpled up. This isn’t right.

# The real problem is the number of cases quickly overwhelming the health system

After a certain point, the healthcare system does not have extra capacity. After that point, you enter into a crisis.

[Here's a graph that shows why it's important to mitigate the disease. Without mitigation, the disease can overwhelm health care system capacity](https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/DW7Ef4vGboMTtawP1iO4DxAeudk=/0x0:1497x841/920x0/filters:focal(0x0:1497x841):format(webp):no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19780273/flattening_the_curve_final.jpg)

That's exactly what is happening in Italy. **Hospitals in Italy are overwhelmed and they are implementing triage. That means they choose who lives or dies depending on who is easier to treat and how long they have left to live. Triage is something you usually implement during wartime.**

[Here's a frontline report of a doctor in Bergamo on how they were completely and quickly overwhelmed by the number of cases.](https://www.reddit.com/r/medicine/comments/ff8hns/testimony_of_a_surgeon_working_in_bergamo_in_the/)

[Here's a report from a doctor in Italy talking about how anyone over 65 is no longer even assessed. That means no assessment - no medical treatment - no nothing. They are left to die because the system is now overcapacity.](https://mobile.twitter.com/jasonvanschoor/status/1237142891077697538)

[Italy also does not have bad healthcare. In fact the North is the richest region and the OECD scored the health system there at 9.9 out of 10.](https://oecdregionalwellbeing.org/ITC4.html)

# Solutions I can do myself? How do I reduce risk

[Read the PSA for a very long list of things you can do.](https://www.reddit.com/r/sydney/comments/fg65kj/psa_regarding_covid19_a_warning/) Here are some key things.

* Practice [social distancing](https://globalnews.ca/news/6652654/social-distancing-coronavirus/).
* After *every* outing, wash your hands and disinfect your phone (the virus can likely [live up to 96 hours on phone screens](https://qz.com/1810508/covid-19-can-likely-live-up-to-96-hours-on-your-phone/)). And you're probably washing your hands wrong. [Here's a short 1.5 minute tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PmVJQUCm4E) by the WHO.
* Stay away from crowds.
* If you have a cough, a fever, wear a mask. It will stop you potentially spreading it.
* Pressure the government onto passing social distancing measures NOW. Not in one week when we will 10x the cases. [Closing schools has a well measured effect into epidemics - basically the sooner you do it, the better you do.](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/208354)
* Consider wearing gloves on public transport. [Follow WHO guidelines for disposal](https://www.who.int/gpsc/5may/Glove_Use_Information_Leaflet.pdf)
* Tell your employer you want to work from home. If you study, tell your teachers you want remote lessons.

# If you think this information is important, tell everyone you know and get them ready to protect themselves for as long as the government delays effective social distancing countermeasures."

Here is some actual information from an email Mayor Siddiqui sent out this afternoon:


March 10, 2020

Good afternoon everyone,
The risk of COVID-19 (Coronavirus) is evolving rapidly and changes day to day. We are closely monitoring the best practices and recommendations of the Massachusetts Department of Public Health and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to guide our decision making.  Gov. Charlie Baker is set to brief residents on the state's response to coronavirus later this afternoon. We have been meeting regularly with Chief Public Health Officer Claude Jacob and other city staff and have organized a COVID-19 working group that is assisting in guiding and coordinating the City’s response.

*There are currently no positive cases (presumptive or confirmed) among Cambridge residents.* The Cambridge Public Health Department’s nursing team, in partnership with the state health department, is *currently monitoring 12 Cambridge residents who are either (a) connected to the Biogen meeting in Boston or (b) have recently traveled from mainland China or Iran.* Please note: The number of people being monitored by CPHD nurses fluctuates on a daily basis as (a) monitored individuals complete their 14-day self-quarantine period and (b) the state health department identifies new individuals for local health department monitoring.

Currently, no school closures have been announced in Cambridge at this time, and  no city event cancellations have been announced at this time

I will be sharing additional information throughout the week and will be sharing the City's  Updated Plans & Procedures as soon as possible.  Meanwhile please join here for latest updates.

Please click here for specific Cambridge Public Schools guidance. We will continue to work in partnership with the Cambridge Public Health Department and our COVID-19 working group throughout this evolving situation. If you have individual health-related concerns or questions, please contact your health care provider’s office or the Massachusetts Department of Public Health at 617-983-6800.

On top of that, the RBa had a lot of movement to work with and help re-stabalise. Then we had a mining boom, that made Liberals look like they knew what they were doing, when in reality they squandered that to hell as well.

This time around, we were on the brink of recession, due to horrible government management- then the Bushfires hit, now Coronavirus is hitting, and the RBA is completely out of room to move with interest rates- and housing prices are 15 times larger than what they were back then even though wages have only increased by 3 times.

2020-03-10,8008135__,ABoringDystopia,8,https://www.reddit.com/r/ABoringDystopia/comments/fgbyws/lol/fk4szcl/,"> Trump proposed a wage tax cut

I'm sorry, but this is false. We need to make sure we're not inadvertently distorting reality.

What he proposed was a ***payroll tax cut*** which supposedly would help employers keep people employed through rough economic times. Employees would also get some relief from paying into Social Security and Medicare via their paychecks, but at the expense of... Social Security and Medicare. 

Employers pay taxes on those they employ via payroll taxes, and those taxes fund the worker safety net Social Security. Employees also pay a portion, but again... these taxes fund their safety net programs like Social Security and Medicare. It's taking from worker's savings/retirement/health account to give people cash now.

*This tax cut would be a benefit to high income employees and employers*. This is a form of trickle-down economics, and cutting payroll taxes is a form of entitlement reform conservatives have wanted for a long time. 

[What he *did* have to say about wages is... less clear](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/trump-proposes-payroll-tax-cut-other-measures-offset-coronavirus-economic-n1153691) (emphasis mine):

>Trump said he'd be discussing with Republicans in Congress ""a possible payroll tax cut, or relief, substantial relief, very substantial relief. It's a big number. **We're also going to talk about hourly wage earners' getting help so they can be in a position where they're not ever going to miss a paycheck.""**

>He said they'll ""also be working on loans for small businesses"" and working to help airlines and cruise lines, as well the hotel industry, which his company is involved in.

>""The American public will be taken care of,"" Trump said.

>***Trump has long advocated for a cut in the payroll tax — a tax paid by companies and employees to fund Social Security — to stimulate the economy.***


That quote about ""hourly workers getting help"" says absolutely nothing at all - just a platitude, yet he is very specific about wanting to cut payroll taxes."

The mortality rate so far has been about 3.4% with it being as high as 15% in the elderly and around 1% or a little less in young healthy people. And while this total mortality rate is expected to go down somewhat with further testing for mild cases, it is not going to be anywhere near 0.3%. This is a virus in the same family as SARS and MERS which had much much higher mortality rates but in some ways that was better because it prevents the virus from spreading quickly. With the current novel coronavirus, 80% of cases tend to be pretty mild which causes it to spread much more than SARS did because people do not know they are infected right away. For comparison, it is thought that the Spanish Flu which killed 30-50 million people only had a mortality rate of 2% which like this current virus allowed it to spread much further and infect more people. 

So while I agree that some of this is an overreaction, please do not spread fake news about it being some sort of hoax. Alert not panicked should be people's response. Let's leave this up to the scientists and doctors studying it."

edit: Michael T. Osterholm is a public health scientist and a biosecurity and infectious disease expert in the United States. Joe Rogan had him on his episode for his podcast and they discussed coronavirus. Osterholm is saying this is going to be 6-12 month issue that impacts older people and those with underlying health issues such as obesity. He predicted/studied this type of scenario playing out, how it would impact supply chain and wrote about it in his book. He doesn't believe its bio-weaponized and discredits other myths of using saunas, probiotics, etc to fight it. Osterholm also states that washing your hands and not touching your face hasn't been captured as affective prevention but that White House officials and public want something to be able to do. Furthermore, he mentioned that saying that the risk is low is a false assertion. Still going through the video but it's very informative.

So really I don't consider it scary and I always have options, but it is frustrating and also kind of existentially exhausting to never really having any money. I have pretty much become a hermit because I have no money to go out and it's kind of depressing heading out into the city when you have a negative bank balance.   


Anyway I am hardly the 'woe is me' type but I will say that I solely see the Coronavirus as a financial nuisance. I guess I should count myself lucky because I still have very good health and I'm still young, but that doesn't make it any less frustrating to not be able to afford regular daily meals that aren't vegemite sandwiches or two minute noodles. My biggest luxury is the occasional tub of $4 ice cream. But hey all things pass and many currently have things much worse either medically or financially, so I feel embarrassed bitching so much about it."

The tests take time and there just aren't very many of them. Therefore they're quarantining everyone. No, your mild fever and cough don't usually qualify for a doctor's visit, but this isn't a normal time. Most people with Coronavirus show NO symptoms whatsoever. You only *think* you haven't had exposure (as do we all). Doctor's waiting rooms are perfect places for viruses to spread - lots of people, some with compromised immune systems, all in one place. Plus doctors and nurses who get it will spread it to the rest of the population. That's why they want to be careful. You walked in with corona like symptoms and potentially put everyone else at risk. Sorry, but as they say on /r/aita YTA. You knew what you had, you ignored the signs (both literal and metaphorical) and put everyone else at risk. I was at the pediatrician's office this morning too (kid has strep) and they also had the same sign. Next time, read the sign and follow directions."

The point is, with a long enough timeline, it doesn’t matter. You bought stocks cheaper than they were yesterday. Than they are today. And they’ll (likely) be worth more in the future.
