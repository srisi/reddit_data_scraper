His original shipment was for more than a thousand ventilators, so overall this effort will probably save thousands of lives when it's all said and done.

I just wanted to clarify because Tesla/Musk have been acting extra douchy around this problem. Musk spent a while being a ventilator denier, pretending we don't need them. When asked to help make more he said ""why? no need"", then he later said he would help, then he bought extra from a stockpile.

People expect companies like Tesla and Ford that have the means of production to use their factories and ingenuity to produce these things for society, at a profit (fine by me if they make a buck doing it), but to get on it asap. I'm not sure Musk is taking this seriously.

So be aware that these ventilators are not the ones being made by Tesla, I'm not sure that douchebag has even begun making any, he might still be in ventilator denial mode. Musk seems to be planning to wait until it's too late and people are dying in droves before he actually makes some ventilators.

These ventilators he is giving away were just a means to appease the people begging him to help make new ones. Instead of taking the request seriously he bought some to give away, but what we need from him is producing new ones, not reshuffling a warehouse stock of existing ones. We could have done that ourselves, we don't need Tesla factories to buy and distribute existing ventilators."

Many people testing positive with CV19 who have mild symptoms are being sent home to self quarantine. A potential complication of CV19 can be pneumonia, which increases your chance for hospitalization. Nurses have some simple non-medical interventions that we do in the hospital setting to help prevent and treat pneumonia. I wanted to share these with everyone so that people have the option of trying some or all of these at home to be proactive in their healing if they feel inclined. With that being said, ALWAYS follow your physician's advice, always listen to your own body, and NEVER push yourself past your limits when ill. 

1) Get out of bed. Sit up in comfortable chair as you can tolerate while awake.  If you are unable to tolerate sitting up all day, at least try 3 times a day for 30-60 minutes.  This facilitates lung expansion and breathing. 

2) Ambulating (walking). Get up and take small walks to the restroom,  kitchen,  or throughout your quarantined area as you can tolerate. Be very careful not to overexert yourself. This will help expand your lungs as well as mobilize secretions (aka get the junk up and out of your lungs). 

3) Incentive Spirometry. Order an incentive spirometer (amazon has them) and use it 10-15 times per hour while awake. Follow instructions. This will help you to take slow deep breaths and pop open the little air sacks inside your lungs to keep them sufficiently inflated. If you are unable to obtain an incentive spirometer, do deep breathing exercises. See next.  

4)Breathing. Deep Breath every hour while awake. Breathe in deeply and slowly through your nose. Hold for 3 to 5 seconds. Breathe out slowly and completely through pursed lips. Don’t force your breath out. Rest and repeat 10 times every hour. Rest longer if you become dizzy or lightheaded.

5) Turning. While laying down,  switch positions every hour if possible to help mobilize secretions (again, move that junk out). 

6) Coughing. Breathe in deeply and cough firmly. If you cough up mucous, spit out into tissue and discard. Repeat the coughing until there isn’t any more mucous. If you have a lot of mucous, you may need to take a break so you don’t get too tired. If you are experiencing discomfort try firmly hugging a pillow against your chest while coughing to help. 

7) Fluids. Drink lots and lots of fluid (unless contraindicated) to prevent dehydration and also to help thin secretions so that they come up easier. 

8. Self isolate. Be sure to self isolate to protect your loved ones and flatten the curve, but also to prevent you from getting a secondary infection. 

9) Rest. Get plenty of rest and good sleep so that your body has time to heal and recover. 

These interventions are used in the hospital setting to compliment physician's orders. If you have any concerning symptoms please call your physician. If you have any emergency symptoms please call 911 and go to emergency room. 

This information isn't easily accessible through a quick Google search so please share with others to help spread the word to any who might be interested."

But efforts to curb the spread of the virus might mean that the planet itself is moving a little less. 

>Researchers who study Earth’s movement are reporting a drop in seismic noise — the hum of vibrations in the planet’s crust — that could be the result of transport networks and other human activities being shut down. They say this could allow detectors to spot smaller earthquakes and boost efforts to monitor volcanic activity and other seismic events.

>Just as natural events such as earthquakes cause Earth’s crust to move, so do vibrations caused by moving vehicles and industrial machinery. And although the effects from individual sources might be small, together they produce background noise, which reduces seismologists’ ability to detect other signals occurring at the same frequency.

Pretty interesting -- the reduction in human activity (industry, traffic, transportation etc) is causing there to be notably less seismic ""noise"" in the Earth's crust."

EDIT

Below is the portion of the article I am referring to which can be found in the discussion section. Based on their phrasing it sounds as if 1.1-1.2million is a best case scenario for the US. As a user mentioned below, there may be updated projections (I have not been able to find these yet though).

""Perhaps our most significant conclusion is that mitigation is unlikely to be feasible without emergency surge capacity limits of the UK and US healthcare systems being exceeded many times over. In the most effective mitigation strategy examined, which leads to a single, relatively short epidemic (case isolation, household quarantine and social distancing of the elderly), the surge limits for both general ward and ICU beds would be exceeded by at least 8-fold under the more optimistic scenario for critical care requirements that we examined. In addition, even if all patients were able to be treated, we predict there would still be in the order of 250,000 deaths in GB, and 1.1-1.2 million in the US."""

In choosing not to issue a statewide stay-at-home order, as more than 20 other governors have done, he has said it would be counterproductive to shut down parts of the state with only a few confirmed coronavirus cases.
>         
>On Monday, DeSantis continued to hold that line, issuing an executive order that reinforces stay-at-home decrees issued by local government authorities only in Monroe, Miami-Dade, Broward and Palm Beach counties. Despite projections that Florida may experience a peak in hospitalizations and deaths in early May, DeSantis said the order would last two weeks, because he believes the country will be rebounding before Trump’s current end-of-April social distancing recommendations expire.

It has been stuck off the coast of Panama for days after Chile, Argentina, Mexico, Peru, and Panama refused to let her dock. Healthy passengers have transferred to sister ship Rotterdam to try and stop the spread of sickness on the Zaandam. Both ships were allowed to sail through the Panama Canal after Panama initially refused. 

Florida officials aren't happy about the situation and haven't fully made up their minds on what they'll do when the ships get there. Right now Gov DeSantis and Ft. Lauderdale's Mayor have said that they don't want the ships to dock, but seem to have left the door open to allow them to dock with some major restrictions attached. Meanwhile Carnival also dropped the bomb on Florida officials that two MORE ships, from Princess Cruises, are also on their way to Ft. Lauderdale, this came as a complete surprise to Florida health offices. Holland America says that 4 people have already died on the Zaandam and there are some passengers so sick onboard that they don't know if they'll survive the journey to Florida

&#x200B;

 

This study examined homemade masks as an alternative to commercial face masks.

#### METHODS:

Several household materials were evaluated for the capacity to block bacterial and viral aerosols. Twenty-one healthy volunteers made their own face masks from cotton t-shirts; the masks were then tested for fit. The number of microorganisms isolated from coughs of healthy volunteers wearing their homemade mask, a surgical mask, or no mask was compared using several air-sampling techniques.

#### RESULTS:

The median-fit factor of the homemade masks was one-half that of the surgical masks. Both masks significantly reduced the number of microorganisms expelled by volunteers, although the **surgical mask was 3 times more effective in blocking transmission than the homemade mask.**

#### CONCLUSION:

**Our findings suggest that a homemade mask should only be considered as a last resort to prevent droplet transmission from infected individuals, but it would be better than no protection.**"

That is the first step in infection, after binding an enveloped virus like this coronavirus merges with the cell and deposits it's contents into the cell and starts the process of replication. 

The cell surface receptor used by the virus determines which cells within the host is will be able to infect. 

We had already determined that this coronavirus was able to use ace2 as an entry receptor, and this article implies that it can also use sialic acid. Both are widely expressed, so it doesn't change much, but if it's able to use more than one receptor then you cannot rely on inhibiting just ace2 receptor binding if you want to inhibit viral entry into host cells"

(Link: [https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/27/opinion/coronavirus-trump-testing-shortages.html](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/27/opinion/coronavirus-trump-testing-shortages.html))

Here are the first three paragraphs of this piece:

""Of all the resources lacking in the Covid-19 pandemic, the one most desperately needed in the United States is a unified national strategy, as well as the confident, coherent and consistent leadership to see it carried out. The country cannot go from one mixed-message news briefing to the next, and from tweet to tweet, to define policy priorities. It needs a science-based plan that looks to the future rather than merely reacting to latest turn in the crisis.

Let’s get one thing straight: From an epidemiological perspective, the current debate, which pits human life against [long-term economics](https://insight.kellogg.northwestern.edu/ARTICLE/ECONOMIC-COST-CORONAVIRUS-RECESSION-COVID-DEATHS), presents a false choice. Just as a return to even a new normal is unthinkable for the foreseeable future — and well past Easter, Mr. Trump — a complete shutdown and shelter-in-place strategy cannot last for months. There are just too many essential workers in our intertwined lives beyond the health care field — sanitation workers; grocery clerks, and food handlers, preparers and deliverers; elevator mechanics; postal workers — who must be out and about if society is to continue to function.

A middle-ground approach is the only realistic one — and defining what that looks like means doing our best to keep all such workers safe. It also means leadership. Above all, it means being realistic about what is possible and what is not, and communicating that clearly to the American public."""

But I do ascribe to the belief that ""all models are wrong and some provide helpful information."" :) 

Based on my own understanding of the likely impact of the pandemic on Minnesota (per its epidemiology in Asia and the EU) it is fair to say that we can expect up to 50-60% of all Minnesotans will become infected over the next 6-15 months. We can estimate that 1-2% of those who become infected will die from their infection. Based on the Minnesota population of 5.6 million, that means somewhere between 28,000 and 56,000 people will die from this infection. Last year, 41,854 people died in the state from all other causes, including influenza and other infectious diseases. 

It's unclear what time period that Tony Fauci was including in his estimates of deaths. On a nationwide basis, using our estimates here in Minnesota, I think that you can make an estimate of deaths in the US will be in the 1.4-2.8 million range. This includes deaths throughout the next 15 or more months. These numbers are my best guestimate at this time, and are subject to change with new data."

* 1109 recoveries vs. 837 deaths which is good in terms of both the rate and the ratio of recoveries to deaths.

March 21: 24.90% (6,557/26,336)

Based on my own understanding of the likely impact of the pandemic on Minnesota (per its epidemiology in Asia and the EU) it is fair to say that we can expect up to 50-60% of all Minnesotans will become infected over the next 6-15 months. We can estimate that 1-2% of those who become infected will die from their infection. Based on the Minnesota population of 5.6 million, that means somewhere between 28,000 and 56,000 people will die from this infection. Last year, 41,854 people died in the state from all other causes, including influenza and other infectious diseases.

It's unclear what time period that Tony Fauci was including in his estimates of deaths. On a nationwide basis, using our estimates here in Minnesota, I think that you can make an estimate of deaths in the US will be in the 1.4-2.8 million range. This includes deaths throughout the next 15 or more months. These numbers are my best guestimate at this time, and are subject to change with new data."
