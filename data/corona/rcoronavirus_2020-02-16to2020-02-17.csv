Truthful Japan has tripled from [20](https://www.nippon.com/en/news/l00263/japan-faces-crucial-moment-for-containing-coronavirus.html) to 62 (We're ignoring the poor bastards on the ship)

Probably bullshitting Thailand has almost doubled from [19](https://www.nytimes.com/reuters/2020/02/03/world/asia/31reuters-china-health-thailand.html) to 34.

Everyone had stock piled food, water, generators.. we were ready.  Batteries were charged, liquor was on the ready, and we thought we were good for a solid week in the neighborhood.  I was very wrong.

We lost electricity for 2 weeks, but half way through that we ran out of gasoline for the generators.  There were no gas stations open within an hour drive, no shipments of food going to the grocery stores because the electric was out, and cars were abandoned on the roads from running out of gas.  The heat in our house was out and my 6 month old was wrapped with blankets.  I live in a nice area, but people started looting houses... and neighborhoods put up signs saying that looters would be shot.  Some fed agency organized delivery of dry ice for helping prevent food from spoiling.  We were legitimately stuck, and it was terrifying.

All of these systems are connected.  If someone stays home, who is delivering your food?  Who is at your gas station?  Who is maintaining your water systems?  If the kids stay home from school then parents cant go to work.  Those same parents may be working at the factory  that makes medication or masks.  If the doctors have to stay home to watch their kids, who is at the emergency room?  You can see how this is all connected.

I considered myself ""prepared"" for the fallout of that hurricane.  I had guns, gas, and food... didn't matter.  1 week into a lock down without the community going to work and it all falls apart... fast.  First few days are kinda fun and different, but then your neighbor comes over asking for food or water and things change quickly.

I know this sounds crazy, but I actually had shared your view at one point in time.  Seeing it fall apart first hand in the most unexpected ways was eye opening for me."

1. First off, preparing for 50% of the population to be infected does not mean they think it will. This is most likely preparing for the absolute worst case scenario.
2. The death rate, even in a situation where hospitals are overwhelmed, would not be anywhere close to 20%+. The current rate of mild cases alone [is 80%](https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/most-coronavirus-cases-are-mild-complicating-efforts-to-respond/2020/02/12/213603a4-4dc2-11ea-bf44-f5043eb3918a_story.html), so unless literally every single person who doesn't have a mild case drops dead without medical attention, 20% is an overestimate. This is not to mention the fact that coronavirus seems to be milder outside China.
3. I wasn't going to be to harsh until you called WW1 and WW2 ""minor events"". Are you fucking trolling? WW2 alone killed \~80 million people. That's more than the population of the UK in the first place! If you seriously think coronavirus will not only kill more than 80 million people, but will kill so many people that it will blow that figure ""out of the water"", then I don't know what to say.

If you think that both of the world wars were ""minor events"", then you obviously have no sense of perspective. Stop it."

I personally think things may ease up in Ningbo and Qingdao before the rest as they are further from the worst of the outbreak. But that is based on nothing except knowing that the provinces are all acting independently of the others in the details of the response and restrictions."

The problem is that you are counting in weeks. It's about months.  In Wuhan the virus seems to have started in November, with first concerns in December and first official action in January.

I was at a concert with a ""no photos"" rule, and literally nobody had their phone out for photos because that might affect other people's enjoyment.

Whether their politeness is all an act or not, the enthusiasm and politeness you get from average convenience store worker is just incredible. It's believable at least. In America when the server says ""it's a pleasure to be your server today"", it's absolutely not believable, we all know that job is awful and you just hope I'm not an asshole customer. In Japan they don't really get many asshole customers, so I think their politeness is genuine.

Now like I said, it's not perfect. Lots of problems among men, suicide, lack of interest in relationships and family, extreme isolation etc. But man the level of social cohesion is insane - and their acceptance of foreigners is increasing, as long as you adapt.

She got home to the US, and there was a box with purse in it on her steps, along with a note in Japanese (she brought it to work for a native speaker to translate) apologizing that they couldn't find her in Tokyo, so they'd mailed the purse to the address on the passport. Not a dime was missing, not even some cash to cover the cost of the shipping.

(As a side note, she said it was only a few hundred dollars for the ER visit for a CT, stitches, crutches, and pain meds, and a taxi ride back to her hotel. A follow up doctor visit stateside cost her more. She had a nasty gash on her knee that needed stitches, and bruised ribs.)"

A less conspiratorial explanation, especially with the CDC saying outright it's ""[at some point in time it is highly probable that we’ll have to transition to mitigation](https://www.statnews.com/2020/02/12/cdc-director-more-person-to-person-coronavirus-infections-in-u-s-likely-but-containment-still-possible/)"" from containment is that, somewhat as you say, they have every expectation that it's here, and realized early on a real containment effort was both too late and would have been difficult or impossible to implement without enough cases here.

Basically, they would be getting ahead of the science, the CDC [has been saying since January 31th](https://otter.ai/s/V4P5IYwFTaOjefIQdbc1JQ) that testing is a mess:

> [...] I want to be clear the current tests that we developed at CDC, is not, we're not sure of the natural history of how the virus is isolated. Can you isolate it one day, then, three days later, you can and we are seeing in the cases that are in the hospital. We've seen people had detectable virus, then they didn't have detectable virus. Then three days later, they had detectable virus. We're using the virus cultures right now and these individuals more to help us learn about this virus. How much asymptomatic carriage in fact is there? So I want people to understand that distinction. We're not using it as a release criteria, because we don't know the natural history of how this virus is secreted. And this is what we're continuing to learn.

And since then we've heard this echoed in at least two other nations.  Best guess is not getting good samples, the test itself is very sensitive, here's the best discussion of this I've found [at the BBC](https://www.bbc.com/news/health-51491763?intlink_from_url=https://www.bbc.com/news/topics/cyz0z8w0ydwt/coronavirus-outbreak&link_location=live-reporting-story).  Anyway, after an initial mistake in the first batches sent out likely due to cross contamination, the CDC and four state public health services are starting to test for community transmission in five major metro areas.  Which should give us some reasonably high quality data.

But see that first link, or [this from Friday](https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2020/t0214-covid-19-update.html.html), to anyone who's willing to listen, the authorities, specifically cited here the director of the CDC, and the director of the relevant CDC center, Dr. Nancy Messonnier, are saying loud and clear, we expect this is going to be bad.

How bad?  They *can't* know, it's very likely it won't play out quite like it is doing in the PRC, different culture(s), different habits that are probably relevant to transmission, different medical systems (hospitals are pretty much the only Western medical establishments in the PRC, and they're very new as this goes), different population exposures to air pollution and smoking, etc."

I genuinely don’t see how we stop this becoming a pandemic. There’s nothing to suggest the R0 is going down. There’s no evidence to suggest mortality will be less than 2%. 

If this goes where people are predicting, with 50% of the UK getting infected, there aren’t even words. 

At a best case 1% fatality rate that’s 330,000+ dead. At a base 2% that’s 660,000 dead. With the NHS collapsing and the death rate jumping to 10% that’s 3.3 million dead. That doesn’t account for all the deaths caused by people unable to receive treatment for other conditions or road accidents etc. 

If infection goes beyond 50% population and/or 10% mortality the end result becomes even more horrific. 

I truly hope something changes and this can be stopped, because for the UK, which is objectively a state of the art rich country, the effects will be devastating. That says a lot for what this will do to less developed nations."

Prepare for the worst and hope for the best, as they say.  Nothing wrong with stocking up on stuff for any emergency.  I do think there's a chance that this could get bad outside of China.  It might not get bad but prepping is about preparing for the worst IN CASE it gets bad.  That's what non-preppers don't get.  They say things like ""Well, if it gets bad then I'll prep"" but if you wait too long then it's too late.  Already in my area in California masks and gloves are sold out.  So being PREpared means prepping BEFORE SHTF.  Not after. Follow your instincts and don't worry about what other people think.  We're being logical and looking at the situation and China and seeing that IF it happens here we might need to stay in our homes for a while.  The more people that prep, the fewer people will be out in stores and spreading the virus.

The cytokine storm is best exemplified by severe lung infections, in which local inflammation spills over into the systemic circulation, producing systemic sepsis, as defined by persistent hypotension, hyper- or hypothermia, leukocytosis or leukopenia, and often thrombocytopenia.

In addition to lung infections, the cytokine storm is a consequence of severe infections in the gastrointestinal tract, urinary tract, central nervous system, skin, joint spaces, and other sites. (Tisoncik, et. al, Into the Eye of the Cytokine Storm)(2012)

According to the 2012 study, ""Cytokine storms are associated with a wide variety of infectious and noninfectious diseases and have even been the unfortunate consequence of attempts at therapeutic intervention."""

This is a pandemic and virtually all of us are eventually going to be exposed to the virus.  82% will have mild or no symptoms, 18% get sick, 3-5 of those 18 die.

All the excellent testing in Singapore and Japan does is give us ideas of how fast it will happen, how transmissable, whether asymptomatic people are infectious, incubation times, etc.

China's trying desperately just to slow it down with quarantines, yet it keeps spreading.

Canada isn't even bothering to test people.

I went out for noodles yesterday. Yes it is very quiet but that is due to people staying inside to be safe and stop the spread, not due to the government saying we can't go outside.

Some places that have higher numbers then Shanghai like Zhejiang province are locked down and only one person per apartment is designated to leave the apartment complex every day or second day depending where you are. 

So far Shanghai seems to have it under control and people are doing what they can to get through this as fast as possible and get back to up and running. Currently there are 170 active cases in Shanghai with 161 recovered and out of hospital (if you believe the numbers). I am inclined to believe them for Shanghai or that they are close to this number because I work for a company with over 1000 employees and we all have to fill out a health report everyday. I receive this report every night and not of the employees has been infected yet. Some of them have unfortunately been in contact with people who have been infected so they must quarantine for 14 days. 

Anyways it's not all doom and gloom. I can still get pizza and burgers delivered and they test the people who prepare and deliver your food and let you know they are cleared with a note on every delivery stating their name and temperature.
I would feel pretty safe getting these deliveries because once a business has an infected staff member or a delivery person is infected they will have to shut down for the foreseeable future which would be bad for them.

That said a lot of small businesses and cafes will probably have to close after this because they can't afford to have a limited business and small number of customers for a month or more. The economic effect this has will be felt for a couple of years all over China and some of the world.

Also with reference to factories, yes a lot of them will remain closed till March. However the factory I get my custom Guitars out of did start up last Monday and has been sending me pictures of the newest model being made."

But I want to give you a bit of background about how so many people ended up under some form of quarantine, which will hopefully provide some perspective.

The way you wrote your post, it sounds like you think that these massive quarantine measures must be a rational, coordinated response to the problem, perhaps due to information we don't have access to, or some other factor. The gist is, ""how can you think it's not a huge thing when they're putting hundreds of millions under quarantine?""

I'm watching the measures roll out on the ground, and this is clearly not the case. We like to think of China as a centralized authoritarian monolith, where every action is controlled from the very top. [The fact of the matter is that while it certainly is an authoritarian country, decisions are often decentralized, and even uncoordinated, in surprising ways](https://www.scmp.com/comment/insight-opinion/united-states/article/2166576/how-chinas-balancing-act-between-centralised).

The central government has a habit of handing down goals to local governments without providing any specific instructions about how to go about achieving these goals, or funding for that matter. You then have officials at various levels across the country interpreting them in their own ways and taking matters into their own hands. That way, if things go well, the central government can take the credit for meeting said target, and if things go poorly, they can publicly censure the local official and wash their hands of any blame.

This is exactly what is happening right now, and it's happening on an unprecedented scale, all the way down to the village level.

I think a lot of observers from the west are imagining some giant nerve center in Beijing where all these decisions are being made. While I'm sure there is such a nerve center, they are clearly not going through every city's quarantine and lock-down policies with a fine-toothed comb, and probably are not even talking about the rural counties, towns and villages in anything more than a very abstract, generalized way.

Here are the factors officials on the local level are responding to:

\- A scary and poorly understood epidemic

\- The epidemic hitting in the middle of the [world's largest annual mass migration](https://www.scmp.com/news/china/society/article/2183049/3-billion-trips-40-days-china-begins-lunar-new-year-mass) (several hundred million people travel from the industrial centers and major cities, mainly to smaller towns and villages to visit family, and they were supposed to go back to work over a week ago)

\- Directives from the central government to go on ""wartime footing"" to ""defeat the epidemic""

\- [Contradictory directives from the central government to facilitate workers returning to the cities and getting back to work](https://www.facebook.com/ChinaLawBlog/photos/a.10152520838701109/10156634631961109/?type=1&theater) (while simultaneously ensuring that a new round of infections isn't sparked by this)

What we end up with is a crazy patchwork of measures. While the cities hit the hardest have been placed on almost total lockdown, you have a dizzying array of measures everywhere else. We'll often see, in a single city, some apartment complexes locking all entrances and issuing passbooks to residents, allowing each household only one trip every one or two days for supplies; meanwhile, neighboring apartment complexes aren't restricting the movements of their residents at all, and instead just taking everyone's temperature at the gate, and maybe barring entry to non-residents.

In Beijing, [some bars and restaurants are open and allowed to serve customers](https://www.chinalawblog.com/2020/02/chinas-damaged-economy-under-the-coronavirus-really-damaged.html), as long as they take temperatures and register them. As the capital, you would expect the city to be setting an example for an orderly return to work. But they have recently announced that anyone returning to the city [now has to undergo self-quarantine and monitoring for 14 days](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-china-51509248).

Meanwhile, in Kunming, where I live, all the bars are closed, and restaurants are only allowed to provide delivery and takeout. [QR codes have been posted at the entrance to every residential building, open business and public place](https://www.scmp.com/tech/apps-social/article/3050446/yunnan-province-plan-contain-coronavirus-tracking-residents-public), and you need to scan these codes when you enter and exit. BUT, there is no self-quarantine rule in effect unless you have recently visited a hard-hit epidemic region.

Many of the several hundred million currently on lockdown are stuck in villages. It's hard to get an accurate count, but there are probably [well over two million villages in China](https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2015/01/05/372491552/chinas-villages-are-dying-a-new-film-asks-if-they-can-be-saved). Many of them have set up makeshift barricades at the entrance to the village, barring anyone from entering or leaving. Some have banded together to create roadblocks along provincial and county roads to ensure that no one can bring the virus into their area. People have been stuck in these places for weeks now, many of them city dwellers who just came to visit grandma for a few days for the New Year. They can't get back because the roadblocks are not coordinated by one single authority, and drivers are worried about getting stuck between roadblocks, and being unable to either reach their destination or turn back and go home.

Anyway, the point of all this is that while the epidemic is certainly very serious, the number of people placed on one form of lockdown or another isn't necessarily a good gauge of exactly how serious it is. In fact, I wouldn't be surprised to see economists and policy wonks arguing next year about which ends up with the higher body count: the disease or the government's response.

**TL;DR:** The number of people on lockdown isn't a very good reference in deciding how much you should worry."

>Note: if a clinician determines that a person under investigation should be tested then that person must be managed as a suspected case.

>A close or casual contact with compatible symptoms, after discussion with the department, may be classified as a suspected case and tested for novel coronavirus.

>Close contact means at least 15 minutes face-to-face contact or the sharing of a closed space for more than two hours with a confirmed case.

Just to be clear though, tourists are accepted 100%. But if you move to Japan and don't act Japanese, you will struggle to make Japanese friends.

But I'm of the opinion that the world would be a better place if we were all more Japanese. The respect they have for their surroundings, their neighbours, strangers.

The CIA knows the real situation on the ground in China. It's what they are built to do. Learn things. Do the hardest mission regarding information and intelligence.

That's why Trump quietly issued an Executive Order telling the military to implement an off-the-shelf and preexisting plan to confront a global pandemic (or bio weapon). This is why Trump halted all flights from China. This is why he evacuated all Consulate personnel from the country.

I stand a distance away from customers, carry hand sanitizer and do everything by the book- and I’ve still managed to get sick. My company has explicitly banned staff from wearing masks because it gives off the impression that we’re unclean or we think our customers are dirty. A formal complaint was made by a customer who saw a staff member sanitising self serve checkouts and eftpos machines, so we can’t do that in view of the customer.

The number of cases, along with the media coverage of the virus, completely flatlined a couple of weeks ago. It was very obviously a matter of measures being put in place to control the narrative. Media coverage has picked up a bit more in the past week or so, but even then tends to focus on ""breakthrough's"" Australia is making, or diverting attention to economic issues that are arising out of this disease running rampant ""in China"".

I can't see how, after this, how we can trust a single thing they do or say with regards to this virus. If it does hit us, nobody would regard a single measure they tried to put in place to avoid mass chaos, as they've completely eroded any sense of confidence in the public"

akin to:

1. Use all means to partition and isolate people in infected areas from increasing the infection rate.
2. Build hospitals to host and treat existing patients as many as possible.
3. Use learnings during this time to increase efficiency/efficacy of treatments -- from drugs, to plasma treatments.
4. Allow hospital loads to stabillize.
5. Then slowly allow critical industries to restart in order to recover the damaged economy.
6. If infection rates increase, then restore the partitioning and isolation strategy to the affected areas.

They can keep on this strategy for 1 year or when a vaccine is found.

This strategy will prevent total social collapse, and buy time.

I think it will work.

Also real numbers don't really matter. If they report 10k deaths, critics will say they are lying and it is actually 100k.  

What really matters is keep society under control so that hospitals are able to process all the infected -- prevent the existing infection rates from exponential growth.  I think in these aspects they have achieved some success."

He's talking about people coming in to a hospital around Buffalo over the past month and testing positive for COVID19 (theres no way Buffalo has been testing for COVD19 for over a month) At least according to his wife and his many friends who work in local hospitals and (as I recall) social media posts by firemen. Moreover, did you not hear where he announced that the hospitals tested the patients then, when the test came back positive, they hid that diagnosis from hospital staff? This was the point where the host had to step in and reframe things, reminding him that nobody local had COVID19 tests at the time and suddenly the story is about people being released while waiting for CDC test results.
 
There's absolutely nothing about this that sounds trustworthy. Have actual whistleblowers with documentation and maybe there's a story.

Assume for worst-case scenario planning that sometime in the next 2-3 years, all your major markets and production centers will go into 3-to-6-month production (or purchasing) shutdowns to deal with COVID outbreaks.  

It's possible that AFTER the pandemic, people are going to be paranoid about germs. Furniture types that are hard to clean/disinfect could go out of style.  

Hospitals are likely to be major buyers of easy-to-disinfect furniture though.  Leather, wood, plastic? New textiles not made in China?  You can bet the textile business will be working on new production lines...

Yes!  SARS emerged naturally in 2006, and MERS jumped from bats to camels and made some half-ass attempts at infecting humans in 2012, so the odds of it happening again at any given time are pretty good.  Wuhan has a big wildlife market, and the animal trade grows with China's wealth, and pushes farther into the wild lands with unfamiliar viruses.  Entirely possible.  But it really happened right beside a bio weapon lab?  Does fate have a sick sense of humor?

I think either scenarios is entirely possible, based on what we know.  The truth may never come out.  But the people who are certain it is one or the other are overconfident."

I have no experience or idea what we have to do to prepare for a global supply chain disruption.

&#x200B;

Ill take a shot at it, but its likely not what you want to hear.

If you are around any populated area, just be ready to leave.  I always thought that people who left their houses when they had mandatory evacuations were a bunch of little babies for not toughing it out... and that is just not the case.  Its not about YOU being able to tough it out, its everyone else too.  The guy down the street who needs XYZ supplies and keeps coming to you, do you give it to him not knowing when your family will NEED it?  Would you let someone suffer, or even worse... get in some altercation?  None of this is worth it.  Just pack up and get out.

Unless you have isolated your existence and have been living that lifestyle, your neighbors become a liability.

I have a place that my neighbor has developed that is 4 hours away with total isolation.  That is my escape.  Our whole family knows how to get there.  If we can't go there, we will just drive west and get gas along the way until we find a place to wait out whatever shitshow is happening in NYC.  Bring a lot of cash.

Don't get me wrong, I would do exactly what I did before.... but I would NOT have used the gas from my car for my generator.  I would have kept a full tank, and many extra gas cans to get me at least 12 hours of driving away.  When we lost our ability to power that generator, we should have just left."

Never thought anything of it at the time.

Maybe it spread outside of China some time ago and just never got picked up because it was too close to flu unless you were looking for it specifically? Even the test kits designed to detect it struggle, and if local environmental factors like smog, smoking habits and poor understanding of how infections work  make the infection deadly it could explain the disparity."

We have several areas that are predominantly populated/frequented by Chinese people, and this is where locals and tourists go for authentic Chinese food and culture. The most common method of travelling to these areas is public transport, because there’s no parking. We have a market in Chinatown that gets crazy busy. Especially on the days when they sell produce and meat. People are packed in like sardines, there’s very little airflow and everyone is in close contact. Perfect conditions for viruses to spread. Given the time that the outbreak occurred (Chinese New Year) and the fact that people would have been travelling to/from China, it’s not impossible that one/some of them may have been exposed to the virus themselves or had contact with friend/relative with the virus. The cost of living and workplace culture means that most of us are expected to turn up to work when we’re sick, further increasing the likelihood that illnesses will spread."

That was very early research.

Later research suggests it's smokers who express the ACE2 receptor in large quantities.

But since there are so many smokers in China, it looked like a race thing.

https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202002.0051/v1/download

> Recently, studies found that 2019-nCov and SARS-nCov share the same receptor, ACE2. In this study, we analyzed four large-scale datasets of normal lung tissue to investigate the disparities related to race, age, gender and smoking status in ACE2 gene expression. **No significant disparities in ACE2 gene expression were found between racial groups (Asian vs Caucasian)**, age groups (>60 vs <60) or gender groups (male vs female). **However, we observed significantly higher ACE2 gene expression in smoker samples compared to nonsmoker samples.** This indicates the smokers may be more susceptible to 2019-nCov and thus smoking history should be considered in identifying susceptible population and standardizing treatment regimen.

I'm not saying this research is gold standard, but it seems safer to just say ""we think"".

So, let's not spread the race thing. Because it might well be dangerous (false sense of security) misinformation."

They take everyone from a temp agency, even bus people in from nearby cities. People take long breaks, don’t come back from lunch it’s an ongoing thing for years. They will hire anyone that’s a warm body. They are shutting down lines weekly from a lack of workers... keep in mind these jobs are union, pay well, free health insurance etc. it’s just hard work, they used to make all the parts in their factory but now some are made in China then shipped over. They still have all the machines and could easy open up the second floor and make everything at this location again, but there is just not enough people to cover what they do now let alone a ramp up. They are the only manufacturer of what they make in US. It has nothing to do with health care or anything it’s an ag product that also has nothing to do with food supply (not trying to cause panic their business has zero impact on this to be clear) but they have employed a ton of people I know and they all say the same thing they need people who can do manual labor. Who are willing to work in a factory, and willing to work hard. they have to pay crazy amounts for employees and have the best benefits because of the union but even then can’t find enough people to do the job, so instead they can spend a fraction of the cost and save on some parts ordered and still employee at least part of the local community without packing and completely going overseas."

I have clients that looked at moving out of China into either Korea, Vietnam, or Thailand when the tariffs first hit and I know the “up and running” time for getting everything switched over was 6 months at a minimum and even if everything went perfect they would only be beating out the chinese labor rate + tariffs barely if the tariffs stayed in place permanently.

(part of these cost benefit equations for cost also hinge on currency manipulation with China against the US but that’s a whole different discussion)

Additionally the concern was the fact they may move all production and then all of a sudden the tariffs disappear because it was “just a trade war” or the new factory they just invested all this time and energy into can’t produce the goods at the same quality China could.

Lots of folks like to complain about “cheap Chinese crap” in America but when it comes to industrial manufacturing some of the highest quality items in the world are produced there.

As for the US it is nightmarishly expensive to reopen your doors stateside and we have unions/labor laws/ cultural differences to boot. Not saying that’s right, just saying it’s the fact of reality when it comes to the bottom dollar."

3. The people that recover tend to take longer to recover than the people that die. So the percentage of people in the hospital that will recover is likely going to be a higher percentage than the current recovered percentage. 
 
4. Western hospitals are likely better equipped to handle patients with Coronavirus than the hospitals in China, especially the make-shift hospitals that popped up overnight.

I love the place, and I consider their people to be generally high character people. Of course every country has bad or crazy people, but the social trust in Japan is off the charts. You'd be surprised how much less stress you can have in life if you're not always worried about someone stealing stuff from you, mugging you, scamming you, or dealing with businesses that love to use underhanded tactics to get more money out of you like with fees.

I like the feeling that other people are willing to go the extra mile for you or give you the benefit of the doubt and reciprocating this in turn. Even the airport security is downright pleasant. It made me want to behave more kindly to others and be less selfish because I know the people around me have my back, and I'm just a foreigner so who knows what the Japanese feel.

Some drawbacks of their society is probably an over emphasis on work culture or the appearance of working culture. I can see the toll this takes on the faces of people on the train in the mornings. It was pretty rare to find openly happy adult men there because the stress must take a toll on them. Or maybe I'm just generalizing, it was just my impression."

A link to a news post is *not* evidence.  

I know the virus is very concerning, but it is very important that what you are learning is 100% TRUE. Otherwise, it is no better than a large circlejerk of conspiracies and stories. 

This is not China. If OP wants, they could easily partially cover their own identity in a picture or at least provide some logs of texts or something similar.

> To National Health Commission: On January 5th, 2020, Professor Zhang Yongzhen’s team from Shanghai Public Health Center, along with Wuhan Central Hospital and the CDC of Wuhan, detected a coronavirus similar to SARS-CoV from the bronchoalveolar lavage of an unexplained pneumonia patient from Wuhan South China Seafood Wholesale Market in Wuhan, Hubei.

> They obtained the full genome of the virus through high throughput sequencing. The result showed that the homology between this virus and SARS-CoV is up to 89.11% and therefore, the researchers named it Wuhan-Hu-1 coronavirus (WHCV). Because we only have samples from one critically ill patient, we analyzed their symptoms as well as the clinic features of other patients.

> We then came to the conclusion that unexplained pneumonia in Wuhan South China Seafood Wholesale Market is caused by WHCV. Because WHCV has a shared ancestory with SARS-CoV, it should also spread through the respiratory system. We hereby suggest taking corresponding prevention and control measures in public places and using antiviral treatment in clinical settings.

The CCP government knew of this outbreak at latest Jan 5, yet didn’t do anything until 2 weeks later. This is definitely a coverup that has gone horribly wrong"

Their work culture is definitely the biggest negative aspect, and it kind of comes from the whole respectful culture they have - but the younger generation are slowly changing things.
