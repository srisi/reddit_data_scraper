&#x200B;

""Today we learned a patient we are treating here at UC Davis Medical Center for the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) is being investigated by the CDC as possibly the first patient to have received the infection from exposure in the community. 

This patient was transferred to us from another Northern California hospital on Wednesday, Feb 19. When the patient arrived, the patient had already been intubated, was on a ventilator, and given droplet protection orders because of an undiagnosed and suspected viral condition. Since the patient arrived with a suspected viral infection, our care teams have been taking the proper infection prevention (contact droplet) precautions during the patient’s stay. 

Upon admission, our team asked public health officials if this case could be COVID-19. We requested COVID-19 testing by the CDC, since neither Sacramento County nor CDPH is doing testing for coronavirus at this time. Since the patient did not fit the existing CDC criteria for COVID-19, a test was not immediately administered. UC Davis Health does not control the testing process. 

On Sunday, the CDC ordered COVID-19 testing of the patient and the patient was put on airborne precautions and strict contact precautions, because of our concerns about the patient’s condition.  Today the CDC confirmed the patient’s test was positive. 

This is not the first COVID-19 patient we have treated, and because of the precautions we have had in place since this patient’s arrival, we believe there has been minimal potential for exposure here at UC Davis Medical Center.  

We are proud of our health care workers who have been working to care for this patient and are committed to saving this patient’s life.  Just as when a health care worker has a small chance of exposure to other illnesses, such as TB or pertussis, we are following standard CDC protocols for determination of exposure and surveillance.  So, out of an abundance of caution, in order to assure the health and safety of our employees, we are asking a small number of employees to stay home and monitor their temperature.  We are handling this in the same way we manage other diseases that require airborne precautions and monitoring.  We are in constant communication with the state health department and the CDC and Sacramento County Public Health about the optimal management of this patient and possible employee exposures. 

As we regularly handle patients with infectious diseases, we have robust infection control protocols in place to handle this patient and others with more frequently seen infectious diseases.  In this case, we are dedicated to providing the best care possible for this patient and continuing to protect the health of our employees who care for them. 

There are a number of informational resources, including a Q&A and background information on COVID-19 on The Insider and the UC Davis Health website."""

Officials have begun tracing the contacts of the resident to find out how the person may have been infected and who else might have been exposed..

This is a developing story. It will be updated.

A new case of coronavirus was confirmed in the United States on Wednesday as several other countries also confirmed new cases and deaths, and President Trump called for a 6:30 p.m. news conference with officials from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and others to discuss the spread of the virus. He accused the media of stoking panic about financial markets.

The Dow Jones industrial average endured its worst two-day slump in four years Tuesday. On Wednesday, it was up 300 points shortly after open, but closed down about 124 points.

On European and Asian financial markets, economic alarms continued to flash, however, with cases spreading and little sign that the epidemic was relenting after the CDC warned of the “inevitable” spread in the United States of covid-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus.

France reported the first death of a French citizen from the epidemic as cases grew rapidly across Europe, with Spain confirming eight new cases in the past 24 hours and new infections reported in Germany, Greece, France, Croatia, Austria and Switzerland. A new case in Brazil marks the first known case in Latin America. Although China announced a decline in new confirmed cases on Wednesday, the number of infected people soared in South Korea to more than 1,200, with more expected in the coming days as the state attempts to test 200,000 people<"

A person in California who was not exposed to anyone with the coronavirus and had not traveled to countries in which the virus is circulating has tested positive for the new coronavirus, representing what may be the first case of community spread here in the United States, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said on Wednesday.

“At this point, the patient’s exposure is unknown,” a C.D.C. statement said. “The case was detected through the U.S. public health system and picked up by astute clinicians.”

New York State announced that it has has local testing ready and validated, but the FDA is blocking them from putting it to use and forcing them to depend on the CDC.  WTF is going on?"

>  
>The health ministry confirmed the case was the first in Japan where a patient tested positive for coronavirus for a second time after being discharged from hospital, the Nikkei newspaper said.

That statement is confusing. So she tested positive in late January and was discharged after being recovered (whatever that means) and got seriously sick again and tested positive.

There could still be the case, that the initial sickness was a wrong positive (or the sickness now). 

Another possible explanation is delivered in the article:

>“Once you have the infection, it could remain dormant and with minimal symptoms, and then you can get an exacerbation if it finds its way into the lungs,” said Philip Tierno Jr., Professor of Microbiology and Pathology at NYU School of Medicine.

*The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said the patient doesn’t appear to have traveled to China or been exposed to another known case of the coronavirus. Health authorities are increasingly concerned about what’s known as community spread, where the virus begins circulating freely among people outside of quarantines or known contacts with other patients.*

*“At this time, the patient’s exposure is unknown,” the CDC said in a statement. “It’s possible this could be an instance of community spread of Covid-19, which would be the first time this has happened in the United States.” Covid-19 is the technical name for the disease caused by the virus.*

*The CDC said the case was picked up by doctors in California, and that the patient may have been infected by a traveler who brought in the disease. It didn’t give more information on the patient’s status. The new case brings the total of known infections in the U.S. to 15, not counting repatriated Americans.*

*The California Department of Public Health said the patient is a resident of Solano County, an area between San Francisco and Sacramento, and that the person was receiving medical care. The patient didn’t have a close contact with a known case or a travel history to China, the state said, a sign that health workers are examining the patient’s history to try and find out how they may have caught the virus and whether other people may be infected without knowing it.*

*“We have been anticipating the potential for such a case in the U.S., and given our close familial, social and business relationships with China, it is not unexpected that the first case in the U.S. would be in California,” Sonia Angell, the director of the California Department of Public Health, said in a statement. The state said the risk to the general public remains low.*

### Trump Press Conference

*The announcement came minutes after President Donald Trump finished a* [*news conference*](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-02-26/trump-seeks-to-ease-virus-concerns-as-lawmakers-fault-response) *describing the virus as largely contained.*

*“Because of all we’ve done the risk to the American people remains very low,” Trump said Wednesday at the White House. Markets have been roiled by increasing concerns that an outbreak that began in China, infecting more than 75,000 people there and killing over 2,700, has slipped through global efforts to contain it and is now propagating around the world.*

*“Whatever happens we’re totally prepared,” Trump said Wednesday evening, adding later: “There’s a chance it could get worse; there’s a chance it could get fairly substantially worse, but nothing’s inevitable.”*

*The new case in the U.S. may upend that hope. Health experts inside the government and out have* [*called a global pandemic likely*](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-02-26/virus-is-contained-in-the-u-s-why-are-officials-still-worried)*, pointing to the virus’s flu-like ability to spread, its long period of incubation, and the fact that most people have mild symptoms. While it has a relatively low mortality rate -- some estimates put it around 2% -- infections in large numbers of people could create a significant number of severe cases or deaths.*

*The expansion of outbreaks to Italy, South Korea and Japan has made the spread of the virus to the U.S. more likely, brought in by people traveling to and from those countries.*

*“The chances that there will be more importation of the virus into the U.S. has increased in a noteworthy way,” said William Schaffner, a professor of preventive medicine and infectious diseases at Vanderbilt University School of Medicine. “With the virus spreading in those countries, that just means there are more opportunities for the virus -- which doesn’t need a passport -- to get onto those planes and come to the United States.”*"

Reddit’s Profane, Greedy Traders Are Shaking Up the Stock Market

 Chatter on message boards is reshaping the options market and sparking wild rallies.

By 

Luke Kawa

26. Februar 2020, 11:00 MEZ


In a dingy corner of the internet is a message board, soaked in profanity, bro-speak, and greed, where posters with handles such as OverthrowYourMasters and yolo_tron campaign for their favorite stocks, putting up screenshots from their online brokerage accounts of their moonshot victories—or showing off their massive losses like badges of honor. Some of them think they’ve found the key to fast wins on the stock market. Wall Street doubts they’re right, but it’s getting nervous about what it sees there.

History hasn’t been kind to people claiming to have a magic hand. The latest sell-off, driven by a new wave of coronavirus fears, shows how quickly markets can turn on you. But even veteran traders have trouble dismissing a 900,000-user Reddit forum called r/wallstreetbets, or r/WSB for short, whose tips and tactics have shown an uncanny ability to push prices, at least for the short term. Hitherto sleepy companies such as Virgin Galactic Holdings Inc. and Plug Power Inc. went crazy shortly after being mentioned there. The board may have added a little froth to Tesla Inc.’s $90 billion rally.

The do-it-yourself traders of r/WSB are waging a kind of guerrilla warfare in the markets, trying to exploit what they see as weaknesses in the system to move prices where they want them. For anyone who wondered about where the small day traders who made the 1990s so wild went, meet the 2020 version. After years of indifference, individual investors seem to be finding their way back to stocks, for better or worse. They’re flexing muscles in ways that can easily call to mind excesses from the dot-com era.

“There is no denying the fact that in the month of February 2020, the public is back,” says Julian Emanuel, chief equity and derivatives strategist at BTIG LLC. He thinks the S&P 500 can jump an extra 10% because of small-investor enthusiasm. “This bull market is not going to end until the public falls in love with stocks, and that process may just be beginning.” Of course, timing the moment when irrational exuberance gives way to a mass exit isn’t so easy. Chatrooms where stocks were hyped are seminal artifacts of the 1990s boom and the following bust. They were a setting for bare-fisted digital brawls among all manner of hustlers and promoters, many of whom could move shares on a dime—sometimes just enough so they could get out and leave others holding the bag.

Twenty years later, one thing that’s changed is the nomenclature. It’s frequently both juvenile and objectionable. For Reddit’s band of self-styled “autists”—a term of endearment, relatively speaking, that crudely leans into stereotypes surrounding extremely online people—the chief prize is “tendies” (chicken tenders, the treat an overgrown man-child receives for being a “Good Boy”). Figuratively speaking, tendies are the financial rewards that follow from a successful bold wager. Bears are usually referred to in homophobic terms.

What this moment shares with 1999 is a rising belief that someone else will come along to buy a surging stock at an even higher price, regardless of fundamentals. But while traders at the end of the millennium were willing to wait around for a “greater fool” to show up, this generation believes it can conjure up those buyers through its own trading sleight of hand.

Members of r/WSB believe they’ve discovered a kind of perpetual motion machine in the interplay of stocks with options contracts, which offer a cheap way to bet on whether shares will rise or fall without buying the stock itself. It goes like this: Members make bets that rely on market makers, the professional middlemen who sell you a “call” (a bet on shares rising) or a “put” (a wager on a decline). Market makers, like good bookies, don’t want to go out on a limb. When taking a bet, they lay off the risk. If someone buys a call, for instance, speculating on a rally, the dealer buys stock in the underlying company. If the stock rises, the dealer may have to pay out on the option—but that’s offset by the gain on the shares.

When shares keep rising, managing the hedge entails buying more stock. That’s where the Reddit set perceives a weakness. A favorite tactic on r/WSB is to swamp the market with call purchases early in the morning in an attempt to force dealers to keep buying stock. Up and up everything goes—supposedly. As the stock price rises, so does the value of the calls, often by far more.

In this worldview, the only constraint on success is the force of one’s own conviction and willingness to act upon it. An added attraction: It’s all relatively cheap in terms of an option’s simple dollar cost. For the price of one share of Amazon.com Inc.—about $1,965 on Feb. 25—a decent-size campaign can be waged in long-shot options trading for pennies. That matters nowadays, when the rise of exchange-traded funds and mutual funds has convinced U.S. companies that they no longer need to split their stocks to keep the share price manageable for retail investors. Many companies now trade for three or four figures a share.

To be clear, there’s no magic money machine in options. The middlemen of the market are hardly the only players buying and selling stocks. If the rest of the market sees a reason to sell a company, it won’t matter that r/WSB is pushing it. While options can produce eye-popping gains, they frequently expire worthless.

But suddenly bullish individual investors are putting their mark on the options market. How influential have they become? Typically puts are in higher demand than calls because traders are more interested in hedging against losses. That’s often not the case now—with some stocks, demand for the bullish calls is higher. “This is not normal,” said Amy Wu Silverman, an equity derivatives strategist at RBC Capital Markets, on Bloomberg TV recently.

Benn Eifert, chief investment officer at QVR Advisors, was initially skeptical that the money behind these online message boards could sway anything. He changed his mind. “At least from the dealers”—the middlemen—“they’ll tell you in big tech names, flows are substantial, and it’s moving things,” he says. Smaller stocks are even more sensitive to sudden bursts of attention.

BTIG’s Emanuel says it’s hard to say whether today’s chatrooms or those in the late 1990s have bigger sway. “When I was sitting in a proprietary trading room in 1999, you would see certain stocks be mentioned on message boards, and the process would then be one person saying to another, ‘Hey, this looks interesting,’ ” he says. “Now you see something on a message board, and you might not necessarily see a continued discussion.” Instead, computerized traders automatically jump in. “As a human you never actually see the flow because it’s going electronically,” Emanuel says. In other words, don’t just wag a finger at message boards—look at the supposedly sophisticated algorithmic traders that are following them.

Members are aware that questionable thinking underpins their bets, to the point of self-deprecation. After user SolTrainRnsOnHolGran wondered whether r/WSB’s activities might constitute insider trading, a user named recentlyunearthed replied, “How can we have insider knowledge when we don’t have any knowledge?”

The forum’s zest for call options is a key force behind a broad market trend. By one measure, the value of options traded rose 77% over the first six weeks of 2020. Much of this expansion was concentrated in a handful of stocks popular among individual investors, says John Marshall, head of derivatives research at Goldman Sachs Group Inc. “The size of the increase in options volumes is definitely moving the needle,” he says.

The average number of contracts purchased in a single-stock option trade shrunk to just 6.7 contracts in 2020, roughly half what it was in 2015, says Henry Schwartz, president of Trade Alert LLC. Looking at the combination of small orders and heavy trading volume, he concludes, “Really, retail is the only audience.”

Lumber Liquidators Stock Price

As the swashbuckling day trader’s imprint on the market becomes more pronounced, moderators are getting stricter in their policing of the board—or “sub,” for subreddit. One user, who’d been a member for three years without posting, laid out the bull case for Lumber Liquidators Inc. and promised another pick the following morning. Call volumes in the company jumped to 71 times the previous one-month average, with shares rising 18.6%. This user was promptly banned from r/WSB upon providing the next tip, with a moderator claiming that the poster “tried to use the platform for personal gain.” Members were warned that any interactions with the user on Reddit or discussion of the user’s latest recommendation would also get them kicked out. “This sub is a travesty,” wrote user Deftech1, complaining about the influx of those looking for—or pushing—get-rich-quick schemes. “Can we just go back to losing inordinate amounts of money?”

BOTTOM LINE - Chatter on a Reddit message board is pushing up prices on some stocks and reshaping the options market. Retail traders are back—for better or for worse.

Even if you or your family catch this it's not the end of the world.  The fatality numbers are likely not reflective of the broader lethality per infection because so many cases go unreported and data are still a bit suspect.  Could it be worse than 1-2%?  Maybe.  But also maybe not.  And even then a 1-2% lethality figure reflects people *most at risk* to succumbing to the *most severe* manifestation of this illness.  It isn't a biological black box.  It's a respiratory virus and unless it has magical properties that means most people will have cold like symptoms ranging from general malaise and sniffles to flu like pneumonia (worst cases).  It's an annoying bug, potentially costing work hours in the healthy population, but it isn't mystical.

If people don't look at this with clear eyes, however, and are fed a stream of muddy information that leads them to panic, we are in worse shape.  That *is* a larger threat.

So take a step back and do a self assessment.  Do you have some food and water on hand for a week or so?  Great.  Do you have some OTC pain killers and fever reducers?  Great.  You're probably fine even if things get 100x worse than is expected for a coronavirus pandemic.

Now consider that we have the most advanced medical science in history bearing down on this bug, and the ability to mobilize a (growing) global capacity for small molecule and biologics synthesis with GMP standards.  We already have its genome sequenced, have started mutation/pedigree tracing, and generated some structural information for this bug.  We are going to be fighting it back soon - especially since it affects us all, and because it appears to resemble viruses we understand pretty well.

So don't panic.  Wash your hands.  Maybe curb travel plans to risky areas if you're an older person or have a compromised immune system.  Cut back on public gatherings if community transmission is an issue where you are.

We can handle this, folks."

C.D.C. Confirms First Possible Community Transmission of Coronavirus in U.S.

A case in California may be the first infection without a known link to travel abroad.

By Roni Caryn Rabin
Feb. 26, 2020, 7:55 p.m. ET
A person in California who was not exposed to anyone with the coronavirus and had not traveled to countries in which the virus is circulating has tested positive for the new coronavirus, representing what may be the first case of community spread here in the United States, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said on Wednesday.

“At this point, the patient’s exposure is unknown,” a C.D.C. statement said. “The case was detected through the U.S. public health system and picked up by astute clinicians.”

Please check back for updates on this developing story."
2020-02-26,Not-The-Government-,wallstreetbets,16,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f9rm6p/daily_discussion_thread_february_26_2020/fiusmbi/,"A new case of coronavirus was confirmed in the United States on Wednesday as several other countries also confirmed new cases and deaths, and President Trump called for a 6 p.m. news conference with officials from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and others to discuss the spread of the virus. He accused the media of stoking panic about financial markets.

The Dow Jones industrial average endured its worst two-day slump in four years Tuesday. On Wednesday, it was up 300 points shortly after open.

On European and Asian financial markets, economic alarms continued to flash, however, with cases spreading and little sign that the epidemic was relenting after the CDC warned of the “inevitable” spread in the United States of covid-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus, which has been designated as SARS-CoV-2.

France reported the first death of a French citizen from the epidemic as cases grew rapidly across Europe, with Spain confirming eight new cases in the past 24 hours and new infections reported in Germany, Greece, France, Croatia, Austria and Switzerland. A new case in Brazil marks the first known case in Latin America. Although China announced a decline in new confirmed cases on Wednesday, the number of infected people soared in South Korea to more than 1,200, with more expected in the coming days as the state attempts to test 200,000 people.

Here are the latest developments:

● A new case of coronavirus was confirmed in the United States on Wednesday, bringing the country’s total to 15.

● France reported the first coronavirus death of a French citizen amid a dramatic uptick in cases within Europe. Most new cases are connected to an outbreak in northern Italy, still the largest on the continent.

● Brazil confirmed its first case, which also marks the first known case in Latin America.

● Europe’s benchmark Stoxx 600 index was down 0.6 percent in midday trading Wednesday, while Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index closed down 0.7 percent and Japan’s Nikkei 225 closed down nearly 0.8 percent, as the coronavirus’s rapid spread in Italy, Iran and South Korea seemed to reinforce investor fears that the worst is yet to come.

● Statistics released by the Chinese government showed a decline in the number of new cases in mainland China; an additional 406 cases were reported Wednesday morning, along with 52 deaths. All but five of the new cases and all of the new deaths were in Hubei province.

● South Korea reported 284 additional cases of the coronavirus Wednesday, raising the national tally to 1,261. That number is expected to rise in coming days as the country begins the mass testing of more than 200,000 members of a messianic religious movement at the center of an outbreak in the city of Daegu.

It’s my thoughts about current price action in response to someone with a bearish outlook and a little advice for any newcomers and some general advice. Also, I know my writing isn’t as articulate as others in this sub like DC but here goes anyway:

I’m not totally convinced. Now don’t get me wrong, I see where you’re coming from and like your reasoning here but for me there’s just one major issue for me which makes me skeptical of this. I’m talking about the halvening/ETH 2.0 🥓 chain launch. Now many people might say “the halvening is priced in” whatever the 🐬 that means. But I disagree. The halvening changes the fundamental supply and demand of bitcoin. With equal demand and half the supply of freshly mined (and usually immediately sold) bitcoin means that the price must go up in response. Now sure, the price may rise before the halvening due to hype making the resulting pump from a supply and demand shift less significant since it was already “priced in” (I assume that’s what people mean by that). But the price hasn’t doubled in the 6 months going up to the halvening and that’s what’ll be needed to offset the change in supply and demand when it comes. So expecting the price to drop before then is a bit crazy IMO. 

*Side note: Many people say that if the price of BTC is below X when the halvening kicks in then miners will stop mining because they are unprofitable and the chain will die in a death spiral as miners cant mine profitably so they stop mining/sell bitcoin to offset costs resulting in a further price drop and so on. This is 🐮💩 as the mining difficulty will adjust and there will always be someone who has super cheap power (I was mining ETH for free for a while in my university dorm since we didn’t pay for power!)*

On top of the bitcoin halvening price action, I think that ETH’s ratio gains will continue as 🥓chain and 🥩ing is on the horizon. Especially considering it will come shortly after the halvening, I think we’ll be stealing some of bitcoin’s thunder.

Now this is not to say that I think the price can only go up. Quite the opposite, short to mid term price movement will continue to be an enigma which nobody can accurately predict. However, I do think that macro trends can be predicted with a reasonable level of accuracy. Just don’t get caught up in the day to day or the week to week. Whether you blame this pullback on Coronavirus/traditional market fears or if you put it down to crypto just doing crypto (my money is on the second one), I think the best thing anyone can do (**especially new comers**) is to look at the fundamentals of a project, buy into the best ones and hold long term. Don’t trade, you may think you’ll be good at it but trust me you won’t. You’ll lose money trading unless you have years of experience (unless you’re trading big macro movements such as selling BTC back near 14k on its way to 20k and not FOMOing back in when you see it go up another 50% because you’re not buying back in for a year or longer. But in this case you need balls of steel). Don’t use leverage. HODL your own keys, don’t use an exchange. I feel like anyone who does this will be sitting pretty 10 years from now.

Sorry this kind of deviated off of what I was replying to but I’ve been wanting to say this for a while now since we have had some newcomers arriving and the bull hype is returning."

Such community transmission is worrisome because a virus is much harder to control once is spreads in offices, schools, churches and other public sites. It differs from other cases currently in the U.S., where infection was detected in known travelers who were safely quarantined or in close contacts of those travelers.

Officials have begun tracing the contacts of the resident to find out how the person may have been infected and who else might have been exposed..

This is a developing story. It will be updated.

A new case of coronavirus was confirmed in the United States on Wednesday as several other countries also confirmed new cases and deaths, and President Trump called for a 6:30 p.m. news conference with officials from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and others to discuss the spread of the virus. He accused the media of stoking panic about financial markets.

The Dow Jones industrial average endured its worst two-day slump in four years Tuesday. On Wednesday, it was up 300 points shortly after open, but closed down about 124 points.

On European and Asian financial markets, economic alarms continued to flash, however, with cases spreading and little sign that the epidemic was relenting after the CDC warned of the “inevitable” spread in the United States of covid-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus.

France reported the first death of a French citizen from the epidemic as cases grew rapidly across Europe, with Spain confirming eight new cases in the past 24 hours and new infections reported in Germany, Greece, France, Croatia, Austria and Switzerland. A new case in Brazil marks the first known case in Latin America. Although China announced a decline in new confirmed cases on Wednesday, the number of infected people soared in South Korea to more than 1,200, with more expected in the coming days as the state attempts to test 200,000 people.

Here are the latest developments:

● A new case of coronavirus was confirmed in the United States on Wednesday, bringing the total number of cases in the country to 60. The CDC did not specify Wednesday how that person contracted the virus.

● France reported the first coronavirus death of a French citizen amid a dramatic uptick in cases within Europe. Most new cases are connected to an outbreak in northern Italy, still the largest on the continent.

● Brazil confirmed its first case, which also marks the first known case in Latin America.

● Statistics released by the Chinese government showed a decline in the number of new cases in mainland China; an additional 406 cases were reported Wednesday morning, along with 52 deaths. All but five of the new cases and all of the new deaths were in Hubei province.

● South Korea reported 284 additional cases of the coronavirus Wednesday, raising the national tally to 1,261. That number is expected to rise in coming days as the country begins the mass testing of more than 200,000 members of a messianic religious movement at the center of an outbreak in the city of Daegu."

 A recap of what went down at the Trump Presser as per [Amanda Holepuncher:](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/feb/26/coronavirus-donald-trump-us-response)

* Vice-president Mike Pence will lead and coordinate the US’s response to the coronavirus.
* Trump said the risk to Americans is “very low” but that plans are in place for a spread of the virus, which he doesn’t think is inevitable.
* Anne Schuchat, deputy director of the US CDC said authorities should “dust off” their pandemic preparedness plans. “The trajectory of what we are looking at over the weeks and months ahead is very uncertain.”
* Secretary of health and human services, Alex Azar, says “we can expect to see more cases in the US”, and while containment is working, “the degree of risk can change quickly”.
* 15 cases of coronavirus in the US, as well as three cases from Americans repatriated from Wuhan and 42 from the Diamond Princess cruise ship.
* Trump says of the 15, eight have returned home, five have fully recovered, one is in hospital, and one is about to go home.
* Trump defended the low testing rate in the US (fewer than 500 so far).
* Trump said the illness was “like the flu”, except with far fewer deaths, and people just need to exercise usual hygiene measures like washing their hands. “We’ll essentially have a flu shot for this in a very quick manner.”
* The National Institute of Health said a vaccine is at least 12-18 months away, so will not help this current outbreak, but may assist a seasonal return. The answer right now is containment.
* Trump said “it’s not the right time” to extend travel restrictions to other affected countries like Italy and South Korea.

This passive, laissez-faire, mitigative, \`things happen\` attitude to big challenges will ultimately erode trust in democratic institutions, especially if covid-19 numbers coming out of China (which show steep reductions in cases) are true or partially true and this continues to escalate in Europe.

The biggest dimension of this failure is the fact that next to no countries have introduced universal screening for Covid-19 for all patients with serious respiratory infections. This has allowed this thing to escape out of control. It is not just Italy. Un-traced cases have appeared in France, Germany and Spain as well today. A few thousand extra test kits could have made a huge difference, but they likely won't now (unless we see a strong shift in the response patterns, which I doubt).

Economic crashes, supply chain disruptions, possible long term effects such as  infertility. No doubt there are panels of experts being convened by governments to look at the 1, 5, 10 year outlook for this. The only people getting a fully accurate picture are world leaders, such as the classified briefing given to the US senate a few days ago.

Sen. Blumenthall said after the hearing-

"" This morning’s classified coronavirus briefing should have been made fully open to the American people—they would be as appalled & astonished as I am by the inadequacy of preparedness & prevention. ""

&#x200B;

They know that it wont peak and let up like a seasonal virus. They know that it lays dormant after 'recovery' and re-emerges in some patients. They know that it has a high rate of mutation and re-infects easily. If these things we are hearing about this virus are true, its a truly terrifying pathogen.

&#x200B;

I also think its possible that they know this is a lab-escaped pathogen, so they know *exactly* how bad it is, rather than just what their experts have deduced from studying the spread. I lean towards a natural species jump, but anything is possible.

&#x200B;

In my humble opinion, this is the big one. This is the keystone which pushes humanity over the brink into the depths of the unknown, chaos re-asserting itself into the natural order. But hey, thats just like, my opinion. Empires come and go, and our industrial civilization has only been here for the blink of an eye.

Consider also that those in that age range in the United States tend to be in poor health and our healthcare system is already overtaxed, expensive, and poor performing.

Number 1: USA

Hopefully this will calm people down a bit.

Edit: rolled out an NIH guy who's saying we'll have a vaccine in prototype phase within 3 months, but the containment of the virus has to be done before that. This vaccine will work to stop it next time, not this time.

Now my opinion: this time we just have to let it run its course just like influenza does. It starts going away in the spring and it's almost gone by summer. His statement on vaccine in 3 months is exactly what my father (doctor for over 30 years, has been telling me since the beginning).

Edit2: Trump: ""The numbers are levelling off and going down in China, which is good news""

Edit3: on question wether Americans should be buying masks right now: ""I don't believe we'll ever get to that point"".

Edit4: on stock market: ""the markets will recover... this ends this is gonna end"".

Edit5: on the possibility of starting to prepare schools for the epidemic: ""not yet, and probably we'll never get there""

Edit6: on the comparisons with the flu: ""the flu is much worse""

Edit7: on the markets: he's splitting the blame between coronavirus and the Democratic debate being terrible and scaring Wall Street (my opinion: political spin... disregard... it's obviously coronavirus)

Edit8: blames CNBC for the panic

Edit9: justifies his decision on the travel ban from/to China. (my opinion: this was a great move... getting called racist for this is just dumb)

Edit10: on testing more people for the virus: ""we're testing everyone who we need to test... wash your hands often... and if you feel sick, stay home and don't go to work"".

Edit11: on virus impact on GDP: ""health and safety is more important than GDP right now""

Edit12: on the market again: ""the DOW will be at 30,000.""

Edit13: ""the CDC is very professional and they're incredible people""

Edit14: ""wash your hands, stay clean, and don't grab door handles unless you have to... you wanna treat this like you treat the flu""

My opinion: I've never watched a full Trump press conference... having only seen soundbites before, I didn't know he could be this professional. I honestly expected some kind of train wreck.

Edit15: on doing more press conferences like this to talk about the virus: ""yes, we're gonna do more, and more often""

The fear is not what the coronavirus is now, it's the idea of what it could be come with mishandled or mismanaged border protection and health systems. And also it's the fear of a New method in which people are dying that Americans have not become accustomed to. Sure driving, gang activity, cancers, etc., As bad as they are, are all things we have been dealing with for years. It's something new that scares people. And even if it gets very bad in America and only 1,000 people die, the huge push you see now in the government and pumping money into the health organizations is because it is a new disease, a new unknown pathway to death. If the virus was completely sequenced and the vaccine already developed and nobody took it in America yet, there would not be such a large panic if the disease came to America. It's the fear of the unknown that is driving people.

Edit: if you think that's trash or BS, consider this. If I told you there was a cave that you must walk through and you had no way to object or resist, and that the death rate was 3% of people who walked through the cave. Are you telling me you would just be as scared the hundredth time walking through it as you were the first?...... This directly relates to the insecurity people have when they first start driving. A lot of people are very scared only because they've never done it before. Yes the 100% way to stay safe on the road is to not be near a road ever. So we subconsciously accepted the probability of death from accidents and moved on with our lives. The coronavirus will be the same in a few years, just as influenza is now."

Combined with the massive quarantine, lockdown and vast amount of human, medical and monetary resources pumped into this problem by the Chinese government, it better be working.

Newer, improved and quicker coronavirus test kits are been developed and used. These kits help doctors detect the virus easier and so they can provide help to patients earlier.

In 2021 between 40% to 70% of the world will be infected by the coronavirus
 FEBRUARY 26, 2020
 But coronavirus is particularly dangerous because it may not cause any symptoms in many carriers.  So the chances of the infection becoming a global pandemic are very high as Marc Lipsitch, a professor and epidemiologist at the T.H. School of Public Health, has been warning.  Harvard's Chan, who points out that the current levels of contagion are just the tip of the iceberg.  That is why Lipsitch recently predicted that in just one year, between 40% and 70% of the world's population will be infected with the virus that causes COVID19.

 However, this does not mean that half of the world's inhabitants will have a serious or fatal disease, but many will have a mild or asymptomatic disease.  In fact, more than 80% of those infected will not even notice and the vast majority of the rest will only have mild symptoms.  Lipsitch is not alone in his warnings since even WHO has asked the world to prepare for a ""potential pandemic.""  From the beginning, epidemiologists warned that the appearance of a new disease opened several scenarios: it was best to control the focus of Wuhan and Hubei province;  and the worst that the virus was transformed into a new seasonal disease, an endemic coronavirus, a ""new flu.""  It is what has been known since the crisis broke out.  But what has changed now is that outbreaks in Italy, Iran, South Korea and Japan seem to mean that you are getting closer to the worst scenario.

 At the moment, experts are wondering how serious the panic will be if there is a massive global pandemic.  Something is already being seen in Italy where after the reported cases the store shelves in some areas of the country have already begun to empty.  It is worth remembering that the SARS epidemic of 2003 began at the end of 2002 in southern China, but it developed mainly between the end of March and the beginning of July 2003. While COVID19 is already evolving differently from the SARS epidemic,  provides the most applicable, but imperfect, comparison available to understand how COVID19 can affect markets and the economy.

 It is worth remembering that the 2003 epidemic coincided with the beginning of the US invasion of Iraq and a weak dollar period.  If the epidemic spreads further and continues to affect the sentiment of investors, global leakage flows towards quality, amid concerns of a global slowdown, may have a more sustained impact on the price of refuge assets such as  gold.

 Who is very worried is the World Bank because in 2017 it launched a catastrophe bond issuance for US $ 425 million to support its pandemic emergency financing service (Pandemic Emergency Financing Facility, PEF).  There are two pending tranches of PEF bonds, which expire in July, and this means that the holders will obtain massive profits if the bonds are not activated or they will lose everything if the COVID19 outbreak continues to escalate.  Bondholders have seen two years of above-average returns without worrying about virus outbreaks worldwide.  They are now at risk of default.  A Bonds were issued that pay 6.9% annually and according to the prospectus do not pay if a pandemic is identified and the deaths reach more than 2,500 in one country, with 20 additional deaths in another.

 B bonds with an annual payment of 11.5%, have a much lower level of deaths, hence the high yield.  The activation of the bonds is determined by Boston-based AIR Worlwide.  If activated, bondholders would lose their money, the funds would be transferred to developing countries to fight the virus.  To date, the bonds have not yet been activated, as it is increasingly obvious that WHO can delay the pandemic rating until the bonds expire in July."

You are wrong. There are literally ZERO credible sources of information ANYWHERE, from any health organization, that state people need to be wearing N95 masks. None. Unless you have some magical sources of information about how this is like some zombie movie outbreak (and it isn't), you need to STFU. 

Seriously, I don't know what your collective problem is and why you are buying into the hysteria, rather than science, of this virus. Masks won't do anything. That isn't from me, it's from the fucking CDC and every international health organization that actually know what they're talking about. 

If you've never worn one before, they are very hot, stuffy, and annoying. 

The flu is exponentially more deadly than novel coronavirus is. If you aren't wearing a N95 mask during flu season, all the time in public, every year...then there is no logical reason to wear a N95 mask on an airplane or abroad in Europe. You have a way higher chance of contracting a lethal flu infection, just living here in RVA, than you do of contracting and dying from novel coronavirus. 

You have a much higher chance of dying in a car crash to or from the airport than catching and dying of novel coronavirus on a flight to/from Europe. In case people haven't noticed, there are hundreds of flights to and from Europe daily to/from the US. The thousands of daily passengers on these aren't catching or spreading it, and it isn't going to magically start on your flight unless you have some extremely bizarre bad luck. 

You don't need a N95 mask, and trust me, you don't want to wear one for like 12+ hours of travel.

I'm not just pulling this out of my ass. We aren't worrying about it at hospitals right now, beyond asking people if they traveled to certain countries recently, and the CDC reaffirms that n95 masks won't do anything to help you that common sense and handwashing won't do better. 

It's not the black death. It has a mortality rate, according to the WHO, of 0.7%. The higher end of estimates are 2-3%, and essentially all of these are in vulnerable populations like children, the elderly, and those with preexisting conditions weakening their bodies already. If you are 18-60ish, and healthy, you really shouldn't be worrying much about this. 2100 people have died from novel coronavirus since the outbreak began; influenza kills 250,000 to 300,000 people per year. 

You do not need N95 masks."

Employees of UC Davis Health in Sacramento received this email just a couple hours ago:

""Today we learned a patient we are treating here at UC Davis Medical Center for the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) is being investigated by the CDC as possibly the first patient to have received the infection from exposure in the community. 

This patient was transferred to us from another Northern California hospital on Wednesday, Feb 19. When the patient arrived, the patient had already been intubated, was on a ventilator, and given droplet protection orders because of an undiagnosed and suspected viral condition. Since the patient arrived with a suspected viral infection, our care teams have been taking the proper infection prevention (contact droplet) precautions during the patient’s stay. 

Upon admission, our team asked public health officials if this case could be COVID-19. We requested COVID-19 testing by the CDC, since neither Sacramento County nor CDPH is doing testing for coronavirus at this time. Since the patient did not fit the existing CDC criteria for COVID-19, a test was not immediately administered. UC Davis Health does not control the testing process. 

On Sunday, the CDC ordered COVID-19 testing of the patient and the patient was put on airborne precautions and strict contact precautions, because of our concerns about the patient’s condition.  Today the CDC confirmed the patient’s test was positive. 

This is not the first COVID-19 patient we have treated, and because of the precautions we have had in place since this patient’s arrival, we believe there has been minimal potential for exposure here at UC Davis Medical Center.  

We are proud of our health care workers who have been working to care for this patient and are committed to saving this patient’s life.  Just as when a health care worker has a small chance of exposure to other illnesses, such as TB or pertussis, we are following standard CDC protocols for determination of exposure and surveillance.  So, out of an abundance of caution, in order to assure the health and safety of our employees, we are asking a small number of employees to stay home and monitor their temperature.  We are handling this in the same way we manage other diseases that require airborne precautions and monitoring.  We are in constant communication with the state health department and the CDC and Sacramento County Public Health about the optimal management of this patient and possible employee exposures. 

As we regularly handle patients with infectious diseases, we have robust infection control protocols in place to handle this patient and others with more frequently seen infectious diseases.  In this case, we are dedicated to providing the best care possible for this patient and continuing to protect the health of our employees who care for them. 

There are a number of informational resources, including a Q&A and background information on COVID-19 on The Insider and the UC Davis Health website."""

The UC Davis Medical Center is treating a patient who may be the first person in the country to have contracted the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) from community exposure.

The California Department of Public Health reported Wednesday the individual is a resident of Solano County who had no known exposure to the virus through travel or close contact with a known infected individual.

An email sent out Wednesday by two UC Davis officials said the patient arrived at the medical center in Sacramento last Wednesday but was only tested for the virus on Sunday despite a request made by med center officials that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention conduct a test when the patient was admitted.

“Today the CDC confirmed the patient’s test was positive,” said the email from David Lubarsky, vice-chancellor of human health services, and Brad Simmons, interim CEO of UC Davis Medical Center.

“This is not the first COVID-19 patient we have treated, and because of the precautions we have had in place since this patient’s arrival, we believe there has been minimal potential for exposure here at UC Davis Medical Center,” the email said.

Nevertheless, a small number of medical center employees have been asked to stay home and monitor their temperatures.
Lubarsky and Simmons said the patient was transferred to UC Davis from “another Northern California hospital” on Wednesday, Feb 19.

“When the patient arrived, the patient had already been intubated, was on a ventilator, and given droplet protection orders because of an undiagnosed and suspected viral condition,” the email said.

“Since the patient arrived with a suspected viral infection, our care teams have been taking the proper infection prevention precautions during the patient’s stay.

China acknowledged that temperature scans are not sufficient to detect carriers who are asymptomatic, this means global testing capacities need to improve as soon as possible. 

* Co-diagnostics's (**CODX**) CDI test is able to detect 2019-nCoV in asymptomatic patients, which is critical for preventing spread as the incubation period can be as long as 14 days, and takes around 45 minutes. Additionally, the test is high-throughput with the ability to run 48 samples at once, which is important, considering that governments are target clients, it is cost efficient. One of the reasons the development for 2019-nCoV has been so rapid is the CoDx design software, which automates the discovery process and helps design the CoPrimers faster than could be done by hand.

> “There is no denying the fact that in the month of February 2020, the public is back,” says Julian Emanuel, chief equity and derivatives strategist at BTIG LLC. He thinks the S&P 500 can jump an extra 10% because of small-investor enthusiasm. “This bull market is not going to end until the public falls in love with stocks, and that process may just be beginning.” Of course, timing the moment when irrational exuberance gives way to a mass exit isn’t so easy. Chatrooms where stocks were hyped are seminal artifacts of the 1990s boom and the following bust. They were a setting for bare-fisted digital brawls among all manner of hustlers and promoters, many of whom could move shares on a dime—sometimes just enough so they could get out and leave others holding the bag.

> Twenty years later, one thing that’s changed is the nomenclature. It’s frequently both juvenile and objectionable. For Reddit’s band of self-styled “autists”—a term of endearment, relatively speaking, that crudely leans into stereotypes surrounding extremely online people—the chief prize is “tendies” (chicken tenders, the treat an overgrown man-child receives for being a “Good Boy”). Figuratively speaking, tendies are the financial rewards that follow from a successful bold wager. Bears are usually referred to in homophobic terms.

> What this moment shares with 1999 is a rising belief that someone else will come along to buy a surging stock at an even higher price, regardless of fundamentals. But while traders at the end of the millennium were willing to wait around for a “greater fool” to show up, this generation believes it can conjure up those buyers through its own trading sleight of hand.
> 
> &nbsp;

> 
> Members of r/WSB believe they’ve discovered a kind of perpetual motion machine in the interplay of stocks with  options contracts, which offer a cheap way to bet on whether shares will rise or fall without buying the stock itself. It goes like this: Members make bets that rely on market makers, the professional middlemen who sell you a “call” (a bet on shares rising) or a “put” (a wager on a decline). Market makers, like good bookies, don’t want to go out on a limb. When taking a bet, they lay off the risk. If someone buys a call, for instance, speculating on a rally, the dealer buys stock in the underlying company. If the stock rises, the dealer may have to pay out on the option—but that’s offset by the gain on the shares.
> &nbsp;
> When shares keep rising, managing the hedge entails buying more stock. That’s where the Reddit set perceives a weakness. A favorite tactic on r/WSB is to swamp the market with call purchases early in the morning in an attempt to force dealers to keep buying stock. Up and up everything goes—supposedly. As the stock price rises, so does the value of the calls, often by far more.
> 
>  &nbsp;
> 
> In this worldview, the only constraint on success is the force of one’s own conviction and willingness to act upon it. An added attraction: It’s all relatively cheap in terms of an option’s simple dollar cost. For the price of one share of Amazon.com Inc.—about $1,965 on Feb. 25—a decent-size campaign can be waged in long-shot options trading for pennies. That matters nowadays, when the rise of exchange-traded funds and mutual funds has convinced U.S. companies that they no longer need to split their stocks to keep the share price manageable for retail investors. Many companies now trade for three or four figures a share.
> &nbsp;
> To be clear, there’s no magic money machine in options. The middlemen of the market are hardly the only players buying and selling stocks. If the rest of the market sees a reason to sell a company, it won’t matter that r/WSB is pushing it. While options can produce eye-popping gains, they frequently expire worthless.
> &nbsp;
> But suddenly bullish individual investors are putting their mark on the options market. How influential have they become? Typically puts are in higher demand than calls because traders are more interested in hedging against losses. That’s often not the case now—with some stocks, demand for the bullish calls is higher. “This is not normal,” said Amy Wu Silverman, an equity derivatives strategist at RBC Capital Markets, on Bloomberg TV recently.
> &nbsp;
> Benn Eifert, chief investment officer at QVR Advisors, was initially skeptical that the money behind these online message boards could sway anything. He changed his mind. “At least from the dealers”—the middlemen—“they’ll tell you in big tech names, flows are substantial, and it’s moving things,” he says. Smaller stocks are even more sensitive to sudden bursts of attention.
> &nbsp;
> BTIG’s Emanuel says it’s hard to say whether today’s chatrooms or those in the late 1990s have bigger sway. “When I was sitting in a proprietary trading room in 1999, you would see certain stocks be mentioned on message boards, and the process would then be one person saying to another, ‘Hey, this looks interesting,’ ” he says. “Now you see something on a message board, and you might not necessarily see a continued discussion.” Instead, computerized traders automatically jump in. “As a human you never actually see the flow because it’s going electronically,” Emanuel says. In other words, don’t just wag a finger at message boards—look at the supposedly sophisticated algorithmic traders that are following them.

>  &nbsp;
> 
> Members are aware that questionable thinking underpins their bets, to the point of self-deprecation. After user SolTrainRnsOnHolGran wondered whether r/WSB’s activities might constitute insider trading, a user named recentlyunearthed replied, “How can we have insider knowledge when we don’t have any knowledge?”
> 
> &nbsp;
> The forum’s zest for call options is a key force behind a broad market trend. By one measure, the value of options traded rose 77% over the first six weeks of 2020. Much of this expansion was concentrated in a handful of stocks popular among individual investors, says John Marshall, head of derivatives research at Goldman Sachs Group Inc. “The size of the increase in options volumes is definitely moving the needle,” he says.
> &nbsp;
> The average number of contracts purchased in a single-stock option trade shrunk to just 6.7 contracts in 2020, roughly half what it was in 2015, says Henry Schwartz, president of Trade Alert LLC. Looking at the combination of small orders and heavy trading volume, he concludes, “Really, retail is the only audience.”

> As the swashbuckling day trader’s imprint on the market becomes more pronounced, moderators are getting stricter in their policing of the board—or “sub,” for subreddit. One user, who’d been a member for three years without posting, laid out the bull case for Lumber Liquidators Inc. and promised another pick the following morning. Call volumes in the company jumped to 71 times the previous one-month average, with shares rising 18.6%. This user was promptly banned from r/WSB upon providing the next tip, with a moderator claiming that the poster “tried to use the platform for personal gain.” Members were warned that any interactions with the user on Reddit or discussion of the user’s latest recommendation would also get them kicked out. “This sub is a travesty,” wrote user Deftech1, complaining about the influx of those looking for—or pushing—get-rich-quick schemes. “Can we just go back to losing inordinate amounts of money?”

2020-02-26,johntempleton,Coronavirus,8,https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/fa5iu7/canada_must_take_immediate_steps_to_prepare/fiw1kb8/,"The new coronavirus is spreading in more countries and is likely to be declared a pandemic in the coming days, prompting infectious disease experts to say Canada must take immediate steps to ensure the country is ready to handle it.

Governments should issue clear directives to health-care institutions on all aspects of managing a pandemic, they say, from the appropriate use of isolation rooms and masks to the safe transfer of patients between hospitals to the guidance given to family health teams and walk-in clinics.

“We are trying to do as much as we can to try and prepare at the hospital level,” said Janine McCready, an infectious diseases physician at Michael Garron Hospital in Toronto. “That window is closing on us.”

Dr. McCready said officials need to begin immediately to do what is known as sentinel surveillance to detect COVID-19, the disease the virus causes.

This would involve testing a large number of people, such as patients who visit clinics in major cities, those who go to the hospital with unexplained severe respiratory illness, or those who test negative for the flu, Dr. McCready said. Doing that would help determine if and when COVID-19 starts spreading in Canada, and could help prevent the type of situations unfolding in Iran and Italy, where the disease is being widely transmitted and health officials are struggling to figure out how it started.

“We definitely want to be ahead of it and we don’t want to be playing catch up,” Dr. McCready said.

Currently, most COVID-19 tests are done on people who have a cough, fever or other symptoms who recently travelled to China or other affected countries, including Singapore, Iran, Italy and Japan.

Another crucial issue is a potential lack of ventilators, said David Fisman, an epidemiologist at the University of Toronto’s Dalla Lana School of Public Health. If the virus starts spreading freely in Canada, ventilators will be important in the treatment of patients, particularly those over the age of 65, who appear to experience the worst effects, he said.

“There aren’t enough,” said Dr. Fisman, who is also an attending physician at Toronto Western Hospital. “There’s not a lot of clarity and there’s not a lot of leadership and there’s not a strong voice … in terms of how do you prepare in hospitals.”

Dr. McCready said she believes hospitals may have enough ventilators, but need guidance on how to make difficult choices about how to assign priority to patients who are critically ill with COVID-19.

“We need to be thinking about these decisions now, before I have 10 people in my emergency department who range from 30 to 90 years old who all need a ventilator and we only have five ventilators,” she said.

Evidence shows the coronavirus spreads through droplets from such things as sneezes or coughs. Health professionals can protect themselves by wearing surgical masks, gowns, gloves and eye guards. Precautions against airborne transmission include disposable respirator masks, known as N95 masks, and isolation rooms.

Dr. McCready said Ontario health-care institutions should stop using airborne precautions against the virus and move to droplet precautions.

Without such a change, N95 masks and isolation rooms, which are needed in many areas of health care, could be in very short supply soon, which is why hospitals need to use them wisely, Dr. McCready said.

David Williams, Ontario’s chief medical officer of health, said the province is looking at increasing its testing capacity and whether it has enough supplies, such as protective equipment, ventilators and beds. Ontario announced its fifth case of the virus on Wednesday, in a traveller from Iran. It’s Canada’s 12th, and the third linked to Iran.

Federal Health Minister Patty Hajdu said on Wednesday that Canadians should prepare for a possible pandemic by ensuring they have an adequate supply of food and their prescription medications and follow advice about frequent hand washing and staying home when sick.

Isaac Bogoch, an infectious diseases physician at Toronto General Hospital, said it’s important to remember that, based on the existing data, most cases of COVID-19 will be mild.

“There’s reacting to this situation and then there’s overreacting to this situation,” he said. “We will have to live our lives, but we also have to be prepared for this as well and appreciate this might have some disruption in our day-to-day life.”

For Dr. Bogoch, preparing doesn’t mean stockpiling food. Rather, it means people with chronic conditions should ensure they have enough medication and are getting their health issues managed.

Health-care officials must also consider how they would handle an influx of new patients, considering most hospitals are already overcrowded, he said. The good news is that flu season is winding down, and that should free up some capacity, Dr. Bogoch said."

Osaka Prefecture announced last month that a woman in her 40s in Osaka who had been infected with a new type of coronavirus but had recovered and had been confirmed negative had become sick again. Osaka Prefecture expressed the view that the virus remaining in the body may have multiplied or may have been re-infected.

The new coronavirus test was confirmed again by a female guide in her 40s who lives in Osaka.

According to Osaka Prefecture, the woman took a guide on a bus touring a tourist from Wuhan in China in the middle of last month, and was confirmed hospitalized with the virus on 29th of last month, and was hospitalized at a medical institution in the prefecture. .

The patient was discharged from the hospital on the 1st of this month and his test performed on the 6th proved negative because his symptoms improved.

However, on the 19th, she felt throat discomfort and chest pain. After that, she visited a medical institution several times, and was examined on the 26th, and as a result, she was again confirmed to be positive.

She said that she was wearing a mask and resting at home every day after she was discharged, and she was not working.

According to the prefecture, there are no close contacts, and women are currently hospitalized in medical facilities in the prefecture.

The government has expressed its opinion that the virus that remained in the body may have multiplied or may have been re-infected as to why the woman became positive again.

On the other hand, he revealed that he was observing the health status of a man in his 40s in Osaka who was infected on a business trip and was confirmed to be infected, assuming that there were four close contacts.

**Experts: Antibodies may not have been made enough**

Last month, a woman who was infected with the new coronavirus and had a negative test in the past became positive again and confirmed that the infection was confirmed.Professor Kazunori Asano of the Office of Infectious Disease Control, Osaka University Hospital, who is familiar with infectious diseases, said ""I don't know the detailed situation yet, but it is generally unlikely that the virus will reinfect the same virus because the virus makes antibodies in the body. It is possible that the virus may become infected again or that the amount of the virus lurking somewhere in the body may have increased. ""

**Possibility of ""persistent infection""**

\`\` Because antibodies were not produced enough and the virus could not be completely eliminated, even if the symptoms disappeared, the virus could be found somewhere in the body, There may have been a latent ""persistent infection."" The virus may have grown again in non-respiratory areas, such as the intestine, and returned to levels that could be detected by testing. ""

On the other hand, regarding the possibility of re-infection with the new coronavirus, ""it is unlikely that the possibility is low given that he had been treated at home since he was discharged from the hospital.""

# ""In this case, it means that we can't be careless even after the symptoms have subsided, so we can say that there was a major challenge in responding to the new coronavirus. The virus will be detected again."" The government and municipalities will be required to monitor patients who have been discharged more carefully in the future, as they may infect nearby people.

A: It is not yet known whether weather and temperature impact the spread of COVID-19. Some other viruses, like the common cold and flu, spread more during cold weather months but that does not mean it is impossible to become sick with these viruses during other months.  At this time, it is not known whether the spread of COVID-19 will decrease when weather becomes warmer.  There is much more to learn about the transmissibility, severity, and other features associated with COVID-19 and investigations are ongoing.


Si poate..

Theoretically, the COVID-19 virus -- part of the coronavirus family that also includes SARS and MERS -- is sensitive to temperature. All viruses are made up of a nucleic acid molecule inside a protein shell called a capsid. Some viruses, such as coronavirus, have an external membrane outside the shell. The membrane is relatively sensitive to heat.
COVID-19 remains stable at 4 degrees Celsius and can survive for several years at 60 degrees below zero, according to the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention. In higher temperatures, its resistance declines, but the temperature affects only the virus' survival time, not its ability to infect, the center says.
Similar results were found with the SARS coronavirus. SARS remains stable at 4 degrees Celsius, but will lose its activeness in three days at 37 degrees and can survive for only 15 minutes at 70 degrees Celsius below zero, according to research by Bao Zuoyi and Liu Yongjian at China's Academy of Military Medical Sciences.

Mass transit will have to be shut down.  Workspaces will have to grow to ten times the size and require major air handling changes.  Dense cities will have to be abandoned, because everyone will need plenty of space and their own transport and sharing elevators and sewer lines and air ducts and even sharing elevator buttons will have to be stopped.  What if it can be transmitted by mosquitoes?

And now 20% of the population will be out of work for 8% of each year.  That's a 1.6% reduction in output amid a big increase in costs.  Entire industries won't survive.

People will start to realize you can't survive this in old age, where you start getting it every year after age 65 until it kills you and they will want to retire 10 years earlier, for a 20% reduction in output.  People who get it 5 times in their lives may be unable to work at all, causing another 20% reduction in output.   A 41.6% reduction in GDP?  Amid skyrocketing health care costs as 5% of the population will be in ICU each year?  The economies of the world will collapse.

They've been working on coronavirus vaccines for the common cold for 50 years and not one has ever been successful.  This could shake our economies to their foundations.  In ten years, there could be mass starvations, looting, the end of civilization, as roving gangs fight to take away what little there is left in the world, and the police and military have no choice but to join them when tax revenues disintegrate.

The car you own now may be the last one you'll ever own because the world economy will no longer support the income needed to own it.  When your computer or cell phone breaks, there will be nothing to replace it with because it will be too expensive.  Our lives may have just peaked until we descend into packs of feral dogs, living with stone tools, and drawing on caves.  And the cold.  My god, it will be cold."

1, A doctor’s general description of symptoms for the Covid’s first three weeks of illness.

2. A day by day description of symptoms (from day 1 through day 12) and treatment for the first patient in the USA. He began feeling ill on Jan. 15, was admitted to the hospital on Jan. 20th, and was released from the hospital Feb. 3rd/4.

Symptoms explained by Doctor ihttps://www.straitstimes.com/asia/east-asia/reporters-notebook-life-and-death-in-a-wuhan-coronavirus-icu: 

“I've observed that the breakout period of the novel coronavirus tends to be three weeks, from the onset of symptoms to developing difficulties breathing. Basically going from mild to severe symptoms takes about a week. There are all sorts of mild symptoms: feebleness, shortness of breath, some people have fevers, some don't. Based on studies of our 138 cases, the most common symptoms in the first stage are fever (98.6 per cent of cases), feebleness (69.6 per cent), cough (59.4 per cent), muscle pains (34.8 per cent), difficulties breathing (31.2%), while less common symptoms include headaches, dizziness, stomach pain, diarrhea, nausea, vomiting.

But some patients who enter the second week will suddenly get worse. At this stage, people should go to the hospital. The elderly with underlying conditions may develop complications; some may need machine-assisted respiration. When the body's other organs start to fail, that's when it becomes severe, while those with strong immune systems see their symptoms decrease in severity at this stage and gradually recover. So the second week is what determines whether the illness becomes critical.

The third week determines whether critical illness leads to death. Some in critical condition who receive treatment can raise their level of lymphocytes, a type of white blood cell, and see an improvement in their immune systems, and have been brought back, so to speak. But those whose lymphocyte numbers continue to decline, those whose immune systems are destroyed in the end, experience multiple organ failure and die.

For most, the illness is over in two weeks, whereas for those for whom the illness becomes severe, if they can survive three weeks, they're good. Those that can't will die in three weeks.”


2. And, this:

Symptom Progression Day 1 to Day 12 From
First Case of 2019 Novel Coronavirus in the United States 

35 year old male

https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2001191

On January 19, 2020, a 35-year-old man presented to an urgent care clinic in Snohomish County, Washington, with a 4-day history of cough and subjective fever. On checking into the clinic, the patient put on a mask in the waiting room. After waiting approximately 20 minutes, he was taken into an examination room and underwent evaluation by a provider. He disclosed that he had returned to Washington State on January 15 after traveling to visit family in Wuhan, China. The patient stated that he had seen a health alert from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) about the novel coronavirus outbreak in China and, because of his symptoms and recent travel, decided to see a health care provider....

Given the patient’s travel history, the local and state health departments were immediately notified. Together with the urgent care clinician, the Washington Department of Health notified the CDC Emergency Operations Center. Although the patient reported that he had not spent time at the Huanan seafood market and reported no known contact with ill persons during his travel to China, CDC staff concurred with the need to test the patient for 2019-nCoV on the basis of current CDC “persons under investigation” case definitions.8 Specimens were collected in accordance with CDC guidance and included serum and nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swab specimens. After specimen collection, the patient was discharged to home isolation with active monitoring by the local health department.
On January 20, 2020, the CDC confirmed that the patient’s nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabs tested positive for 2019-nCoV by real-time reverse-transcriptase–polymerase-chain-reaction (rRT-PCR) assay. In coordination with CDC subject-matter experts, state and local health officials, emergency medical services, and hospital leadership and staff, the patient was admitted to an airborne-isolation unit at Providence Regional Medical Center for clinical observation, with health care workers following CDC recommendations for contact, droplet, and airborne precautions with eye protection.

On admission, the patient reported persistent dry cough and a 2-day history of nausea and vomiting; he reported that he had no shortness of breath or chest pain. Vital signs were within normal ranges. On physical examination, the patient was found to have dry mucous membranes. The remainder of the examination was generally unremarkable. After admission, the patient received supportive care, including 2 liters of normal saline and ondansetron for nausea.


On days 2 through 5 of hospitalization (days 6 through 9 of illness), the patient’s vital signs remained largely stable, apart from the development of intermittent fevers accompanied by periods of tachycardia (Figure 2). The patient continued to report a nonproductive cough and appeared fatigued. On the afternoon of hospital day 2, the patient passed a loose bowel movement and reported abdominal discomfort. A second episode of loose stool was reported overnight; a sample of this stool was collected for rRT-PCR testing, along with additional respiratory specimens (nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal) and serum. The stool and both respiratory specimens later tested positive by rRT-PCR for 2019-nCoV, whereas the serum remained negative.

Treatment during this time was largely supportive. For symptom management, the patient received, as needed, antipyretic therapy consisting of 650 mg of acetaminophen every 4 hours and 600 mg of ibuprofen every 6 hours. He also received 600 mg of guaifenesin for his continued cough and approximately 6 liters of normal saline over the first 6 days of hospitalization.


A chest radiograph taken on hospital day 3 (illness day 7) was reported as showing no evidence of infiltrates or abnormalities (Figure 3). However, a second chest radiograph from the night of hospital day 5 (illness day 9) showed evidence of pneumonia in the lower lobe of the left lung (Figure 4). These radiographic findings coincided with a change in respiratory status starting on the evening of hospital day 5, when the patient’s oxygen saturation values as measured by pulse oximetry dropped to as low as 90% while he was breathing ambient air. On day 6, the patient was started on supplemental oxygen, delivered by nasal cannula at 2 liters per minute. Given the changing clinical presentation and concern about hospital-acquired pneumonia, treatment with vancomycin (a 1750-mg loading dose followed by 1 g administered intravenously every 8 hours) and cefepime (administered intravenously every 8 hours) was initiated.


On hospital day 6 (illness day 10), a fourth chest radiograph showed basilar streaky opacities in both lungs, a finding consistent with atypical pneumonia (Figure 5), and rales were noted in both lungs on auscultation. Given the radiographic findings, the decision to administer oxygen supplementation, the patient’s ongoing fevers, the persistent positive 2019-nCoV RNA at multiple sites, and published reports of the development of severe pneumonia3,4 at a period consistent with the development of radiographic pneumonia in this patient, clinicians pursued compassionate use of an investigational antiviral therapy. Treatment with intravenous remdesivir (a novel nucleotide analogue prodrug in development10,11) was initiated on the evening of day 7, and no adverse events were observed in association with the infusion. Vancomycin was discontinued on the evening of day 7, and cefepime was discontinued on the following day, after serial negative procalcitonin levels and negative nasal PCR testing for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus.

On hospital day 8 (illness day 12), the patient’s clinical condition improved. Supplemental oxygen was discontinued, and his oxygen saturation values improved to 94 to 96% while he was breathing ambient air. The previous bilateral lower-lobe rales were no longer present. His appetite improved, and he was asymptomatic aside from intermittent dry cough and rhinorrhea. 

As of January 30, 2020, the patient remains hospitalized. He is afebrile, and all symptoms have resolved with the exception of his cough, which is decreasing in severity.

Coronavirus is scary and I've had anxiety about it as well, but it's not like a plague that's going to kill you and everyone you know.

Try closer to 3.5% vs. the flu's 0.1%

US flu season so far 15 million infected

With a 3.5% fatality rate, over 500,000 would die

It is more contagious and hospitalizes more people and there is no vaccine, and there are early reports of people being reinfected, anyone saying ""it's just the flu"" doesn't have basic cognitive ability

Cuomo went on to say that he believes the case that is pending is in Nassau County on Long Island, NY. 

“It is highly probably that you will see a continuing spread of this virus. It is highly probable that we will have people in New York State who test positive,” Cuomo said

Additionally Gov. Cuomo said that he is submitting an emergency supplemental appropriations bill to the state legislature asking for $40 million additional dollars for the New York Department of Health to respond to the virus. 

Cuomo said that New York State is currently in the “containment phase” of dealing with the virus. “Our operating paradigm is always prepare for the worst and hope for the best,” he said.

Greater New York Hospital Association President Kenneth Raske joined Cuomo at the press conference and said that hospitals have been working on preparing for coronavirus for weeks.

He said that the resources that the system has to deal with possible cases are “significant.”"

The Corona virus is only going to shift the demand for the products and services a month or two forward. This combined with the market pricing in the lost revenue (the recent dip) means that as soon as the companies start posting their Q1 2020 earnings the stocks are going to pump to ATH. This correction is just an overreaction to the virus (market didn't price it in before), and people looking for a reason to sell (stocks were too hot).

New cases of the virus have also started decreasing in China meaning the worst is over. (source - https://www.economist.com/china/2020/02/22/in-china-newly-confirmed-cases-of-coronavirus-infection-are-falling )

The new year holiday just got extended for a week. (source https://www.china-briefing.com/news/china-extends-lunar-new-year-holiday-february-2-shanghai-february-9-contain-coronavirus-outbreak/ ). Right now Xi is trying to get the factories back in production and considering the circumstances they're doing quite well (some provinces have 90%+ of their businesses and factories reopened) (source - https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2020/02/25/as-its-covid-19-epidemic-slows-china-tries-to-get-back-to-work ). The virus hit during Chinese new years, when the factories were already shut down, and a lot of them are already back up. This means that the impact on production will not be as bad as people are predicting.

We only lost a few weeks of production (which could potentially be made up for) and a few weeks of consumer/business demand (demand will shift from Jan and Feb to March and April). Unless a companies quarter ends in March or earlier you'll be fine.

If you're calls are a few months out you'll be fine.

I might be retarded tho since I put half of my portfolio in TQQQ and the other half in QQQ June 30 $240 calls.

TL:DR - Buy long term calls (a few months out)."

If your problem is that the elderly and those with preexisting conditions in affected areas are not able to access a life saving apparatus, agreed. If you're buying into the media frenzy that we're all gonna die because of something severely less deadly, in the big picture, than the seasonal flu, you gotta climb down off that hill.

The Italian financial police have confiscated documents and computer data from the online retailers Ebay and Amazon because of profiteering around the new corona virus with horrendous prices for respiratory masks and disinfectants. The Italian consumer association UNC welcomed the investigation by the authorities on Wednesday.

""It is a national disgrace to speculate on the Italians' back,"" said UNC President Massimiliano Cona. Criminals and traders in Italy had used the fear of the virus to their advantage. ""The problem is not just the astronomical price of the products, but also the sale of masks that don't comply and wouldn't even protect if worn by a person infected with the coronavirus,"" added Cona.

Because of the continuing spread of the lung disease Covid-19 from China, the Italians had put on protective masks and disinfectants in the past few days - the articles could hardly be found in pharmacies and supermarkets. The fear of the virus led to brazen price demands: On Tuesday morning, an Internet user on Ebay, for example, offered a one-liter bottle of disinfectant for 300 euros.

Italy is now the largest focus of infection of the novel corona virus in Europe. To date, more than 370 infections have been detected within a few days. Twelve infected people died of the pathogen by Wednesday. In China, where the corona virus started in December, authorities have so far counted more than 78,000 infections and more than 2,700 deaths."

In regards to your question, it proved to be ineffective to prophylactically get people in quarantine such as in Japan in Diamond Princess since what this does is if someone there is sick but 99% of the other travelers are not, it's the perfect ground for the virus to spread and get more traction. Then the perfect scenario would be each time someone new gets infected the clock would reset and wait another 14 days, so people would stay there for how long? What ended up happening is people got infected inside the cruise ship and then left for Japan under the impression they were in the clear and then they started infecting the general population. 

If you already know there's multiple people who are sick on this plane/boat it makes sense to test them and then evaluate if you are going to send them home or keep them in the hospital

The point is, at this stage of the epidemy there's no point on keeping people locked up at bay since there's a huge chance people will get inside with the virus one way or the other. The overall number of infected world wide is too wide to do this sort of stuff and so far it's proven to be ineffective. CDC who are rigidly enforcing borders already said that this is futile and the virus is going to spread inside the United States one way or the other, people need to be ready for it. 

If it's inevitable that the virus is going to get in, from what I've read and people who are far more knowledgeable on this than me have said, the best way is to keep the spread of the virus by minimizing the chance of contamination to the general population. Home quarantine if done right can isolate a case and no one else is going to be infected"

Trump has appointed Mike pence as the spearman for the ongoing pandemic, which I believe could be part of a plan to branch out the Vice Presidents resume so that he may potentially run for office in 2024, or alternatively, take the downfall in the event that containment plans do not succeed, which would help the president to remain in the good graces of public opinion. Additionally, Trump deflected questions multiple times regarding the impact of the virus on the overall economy and US Equity markets. /ESH20 price action throughout the conference was skiddish with higher than traditional volume (as to be expected) and overall increased volatility in price actions. Trades did briefly reach a new local minima at the 3078.00 level and maintained an overall downward momentum, although with significant chop, suggesting that despite the overall optimism from Mr. Trump, the markets did not see any significant change in sentiment or trading objectives from the event.

Same odds, but reversed to get your thinking past the fear factor. People see any non zero risk and get more worked up because that's how our minds evolved.

98 out of a hundred people will get this and they'll be fine. Most of the 2% will be people with risk factors or weakened immune systems.

>What can the individual do about this?

>Nothing, really.

Your whole write up therefore qualifies as a self negating... and incorrect. You can:

* Wash hands every time you come home.

* Start wearing a mask (surgical or N95) You might look goofy at first. But you should have plenty of company in a few weeks.

* Take vitamin D (1000 iu) every day. This optimizes your immune function and will reduce the likelihood of progressing to a serious case if/when you do catch cv19.

Possible medications include: 

* remdesivir, made by Gilead Sciences, is a broad-spectrum antiviral that Francis Collins, head of the National Institutes of Health, says he’s “optimistic” about. The drug forms a misshapen version of a nucleotide that the virus needs to build new copies of itself, thus preventing it from multiplying. 

*According to some social-media posts, the cure for coronavirus is already known, and it’s the old anti-malaria drug chloroquine. Actually, that’s not proven. But studies of the cheap, well studied, and readily available compound are under way in China, with patients getting 400 milligrams a day for five days. Initial laboratory tests suggest the drug, discovered in 1934, may be highly effective.

Once again, we're talking about medications that might be effective against something that only has 2% mortality to begin with. If someone can explain to me how this equals either the Spanish Flu or ""the end of the world""... I'm all ears.

A new case of coronavirus was confirmed in the United States on Wednesday as several other countries also confirmed new cases and deaths, and President Trump called for a 6 p.m. news conference with officials from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and others to discuss the spread of the virus. He accused the media of stoking panic about financial markets.

The Dow Jones industrial average endured its worst two-day slump in four years Tuesday. On Wednesday, it was up 300 points shortly after open.

On European and Asian financial markets, economic alarms continued to flash, however, with cases spreading and little sign that the epidemic was relenting after the CDC warned of the “inevitable” spread in the United States of covid-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus, which has been designated as SARS-CoV-2.

France reported the first death of a French citizen from the epidemic as cases grew rapidly across Europe, with Spain confirming eight new cases in the past 24 hours and new infections reported in Germany, Greece, France, Croatia, Austria and Switzerland. A new case in Brazil marks the first known case in Latin America. Although China announced a decline in new confirmed cases on Wednesday, the number of infected people soared in South Korea to more than 1,200, with more expected in the coming days as the state attempts to test 200,000 people.

Here are the latest developments:

● A new case of coronavirus was confirmed in the United States on Wednesday, bringing the country’s total to 15.

● France reported the first coronavirus death of a French citizen amid a dramatic uptick in cases within Europe. Most new cases are connected to an outbreak in northern Italy, still the largest on the continent.

● Brazil confirmed its first case, which also marks the first known case in Latin America.

● Europe’s benchmark Stoxx 600 index was down 0.6 percent in midday trading Wednesday, while Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index closed down 0.7 percent and Japan’s Nikkei 225 closed down nearly 0.8 percent, as the coronavirus’s rapid spread in Italy, Iran and South Korea seemed to reinforce investor fears that the worst is yet to come.

● Statistics released by the Chinese government showed a decline in the number of new cases in mainland China; an additional 406 cases were reported Wednesday morning, along with 52 deaths. All but five of the new cases and all of the new deaths were in Hubei province.

● South Korea reported 284 additional cases of the coronavirus Wednesday, raising the national tally to 1,261. That number is expected to rise in coming days as the country begins the mass testing of more than 200,000 members of a messianic religious movement at the center of an outbreak in the city of Daegu."

Within the last week, the city we were to be based near has become a hot spot for the Coronavirus so I was tasked with making an emergency purchase of a case of N95 masks to take with us.  Can't find the damned things anywhere (locally or online); even through the Army medical supply system and contacting 3M direct.

We were about to raid our subordinate medical units' medical sets for masks until luckily, our general cancelled the trip after being informed we'd have to be in quarantine for 2-3 weeks after the return flight.

> Under President Trump’s leadership, the full weight of the U.S. Government is working to protect the health and safety of the American people.
 
> Tonight at 6:30 p.m. ET, the President and members of the Coronavirus Task Force will hold a news conference to update Americans on the federal response to the coronavirus. 
 
> Decisive action from President Trump at the beginning of the outbreak—including prudent travel restrictions and an early containment strategy—has given local officials time to prepare. Last month, the President formed a Coronavirus Task Force, led by Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar and comprised of subject-matter experts, to organize a whole-of-government response.
 
> As a result, America has been able to stay ahead of the outbreak as it develops abroad.
 
> The Trump Administration also recently requested new funding authorities from Congress. With this action, the Administration expects to allocate at least $2.5 billion to fight the coronavirus. That funding will go toward public health preparedness, laboratory testing, quarantine costs, the development of vaccines, and other healthcare priorities. 
 
> One principle in particular has defined President Trump’s approach: radical transparency. Rather than keep Americans in the dark, the Administration wants citizens to be able to see inside each step of the process. The President also wants all Americans to understand how their government is working hard to keep them safe. 
 
> “We’re taking this incredibly serious here in the United States,” Secretary Azar said. “We are doing the most aggressive containment efforts in modern history to prevent further spread in the United States. We’re going to continue taking those measures.”"

I walk to work, and I work with the same 30-50 people every day. I know if they’ve visited Wuhan/China because if they’re not at work, I’ve had to approve it. My likelihood of exposure Monday to Friday is very minimal. 

If I suddenly caught a train/Uber to the airport and then milled around an airport with hundreds of people from unknown destinations and then get on a plane with a hundred strangers, my likelihood of exposure has increased significantly. 

There’s also a perception (and maybe somebody sciencey can confirm or deny) that airplanes are basically huge Petri dishes, circulating germy air around. 

I don’t know if any of this is reality backed by hard science or my perception based on my fundamental ignorance of science. The most important thing I’ve learnt in my 16 year career is that perception is reality.

I was admitted to a makeshift hospital where they have given me traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) every day which was developed by Hunan province.

The hospital gives us two bags of TCM every day for pneumonia. Many patients are healed by just taking this, no Western medicine.

To be honest the environment is not bad. Food is nutritious, even better than at home. After the state help, you actually feel China is not that bad.

Our treatment and food are free. Every morning they organise fitness exercises too, like tai chi.

It's not like we are stuck inside all day. Air is fresh. There are portable toilets. There are sinks and showers.

People are recovering from the virus

My dad is getting better. Actually people say the virus is serious, but if you start treatment early and work with doctors, you will recover.

Many people have been discharged. It's not like everyone thinks - you get it and you will die. My father is not young. He had a high temperature for six days and fell into a coma, and was sent to A&E. Even he survived and he's recovering.

Yesterday his test result came back negative. Although his lungs still show infection, he is expected to leave the hospital soon. It is the same with my neighbours. Some of them had to use oxygen for a while but now they have all recovered and are discharged.

I've been infected for a long time and the condition is recurring.

But the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests [which detects HIV's genetic material and is being used to confirm COVID-19] show I'm positive. It just can't change to negative.

I'm anxious, but I'll just stay at this makeshift hospital and take traditional Chinese medicine.

Now don’t get me wrong, I see where you’re coming from and like your reasoning here but for me there’s just one major issue for me which makes me skeptical of this. I’m talking about the halvening/ETH 2.0 🥓 chain launch. Now many people might say “the halvening is priced in” whatever the 🐬 that means. But I disagree. The halvening changes the fundamental supply and demand of bitcoin. With equal demand and half the supply of freshly mined (and usually immediately sold) bitcoin means that the price must go up in response. Now sure, the price may rise before the halvening due to hype making the resulting pump from a supply and demand shift less significant since it was already “priced in” (I assume that’s what people mean by that). But the price hasn’t doubled in the 6 months going up to the halvening and that’s what’ll be needed to offset the change in supply and demand when it comes. So expecting the price to drop before then is a bit crazy IMO. 

*Side note: Many people say that if the price of BTC is below X when the halvening kicks in then miners will stop mining because they are unprofitable and the chain will die in a death spiral as miners cant mine profitably so they stop mining/sell bitcoin to offset costs resulting in a further price drop and so on. This is 🐮💩 as the mining difficulty will adjust and there will always be someone who has super cheap power (I was mining ETH for free for a while in my university dorm since we didn’t pay for power!)*

On top of the bitcoin halvening price action, I think that ETH’s ratio gains will continue as 🥓chain and 🥩ing is on the horizon. Especially considering it will come shortly after the halvening, I think we’ll be stealing some of bitcoin’s thunder.

Now this is not to say that I think the price can only go up. Quite the opposite, short to mid term price movement will continue to be an enigma which nobody can accurately predict. However, I do think that macro trends can be predicted with a reasonable level of accuracy. Just don’t get caught up in the day to day or the week to week. Whether you blame this pullback on Coronavirus/traditional market fears or if you put it down to crypto just doing crypto (my money is on the second one), I think the best thing anyone can do (**especially new comers**) is to look at the fundamentals of a project, buy into the best ones and hold long term. Don’t trade, you may think you’ll be good at it but trust me you won’t. You’ll lose money trading unless you have years of experience (unless you’re trading big macro movements such as selling BTC back near 14k on its way to 20k and not FOMOing back in when you see it go up another 50% because you’re not buying back in for a year or longer. But in this case you need balls of steel). Don’t use leverage. HODL your own keys, don’t use an exchange. I feel like anyone who does this will be sitting pretty 10 years from now.

Sorry this kind of deviated off of what I was replying to but I’ve been wanting to say this for a while now since we have had some newcomers arriving and the bull hype is returning."

At the moment. Do you think time has frozen?

Also, while the US is no longer 40% of global trade the EU is shrinking even faster. And that's despite adding new countries. 

The US is 330 million people with a $20 trillion economy that is growing steadily. The EU 27 are 450 million people with an economy that is only $15 trillion and it's stalling. 

Even before the coronavirus you had France and Italy reporting shrinking economies. 

They're going backwards - they are technophobic. See their ""faith-based"" ban on bioengineering in 2003, that shifted all bioengineering jobs to the US. Turns out that GM food is perfectly safe and the EU's voodoo-religious ""belief"" that it was harmful was a load of bollocks that simply stifled a promising industry. The same thing is going on in other industries. See how the Commission agreed to defeat devices for diesel (even though they knew these would lead to car companies flouting air pollution regs) because their ""faith"" led them to believe that it was impossible to make electric cars. See how they lag in all manner of tech because anti-science ""faith"" people block advances. It's a dying continent, which hates science and progress, which is full of anti-vaxxers, and whose economy is subsequently shrinking as a result.

If we tie ourselves to this anti-scientific-anti-tech quack union, we'll end up performing as badly as them. 

In the meanwhile there is the whole wide world abroad that isn't a quack anti-science union, where we can prosper."

They cannot keep up due to constraints on logistics and resources, regardless of the price point. The problem is time and capacity, not money.

https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/06/business/coronavirus-face-masks.html

You're also negating to realize that price-gouging creates artificial market conditions, not ""free market"" conditions. A handful of resellers hoarding large quantities of products to sell at much higher price points during emergencies is not indicative of supply/demand. 

You're also not considering the fact that countries with the most production capacity for masks are limiting exports so they can have enough domestically. Therefore, companies like Italy cannot just say ""let the free market make more masks"".... there literally isn't anybody in Italy who can make them...and other parts of the world who can make them, won't sell it to them.  It takes time to build a factory, train staff, etc. We don't have that time."

Many of my friends, my family included, have barely any masks left and just bought 10 for 60 dollars online. With huge lines in front of stores, it's clear that the average Korean citizen does not really have any PPE left. 

It seems entirely inappropriate in this case for Moon to be sending over so many masks and medical equipment that could be used to better protect our own domestic citizens. I understand the concept of aid and all, but Taiwan has banned exports of masks, why can't we do the same.

The Corona virus is only going to shift the demand for the products and services a month or two forward\*. This combined with the market pricing in the lost revenue means that as soon as the companies start posting their Q1 2020 earnings the stocks are going to pump to ATH. This correction is just an overreaction to the virus (market didn't price it in before), and people looking for a reason to sell (stocks were too hot).

If you're calls are a few months out you'll be fine.

I might be retarded tho since I put half of my portfolio in TQQQ and the other half in QQQ June 30 $240 calls so don't listen to me.

Adding on my other reply.

The virus hit during Chinese new years when the factories were already shut down. The new year holiday just got extended for a week. (source [https://www.china-briefing.com/news/china-extends-lunar-new-year-holiday-february-2-shanghai-february-9-contain-coronavirus-outbreak/](https://www.china-briefing.com/news/china-extends-lunar-new-year-holiday-february-2-shanghai-february-9-contain-coronavirus-outbreak/) ).

New cases of the virus have also started decreasing in China meaning the worst is over. (source -  [https://www.economist.com/china/2020/02/22/in-china-newly-confirmed-cases-of-coronavirus-infection-are-falling](https://www.economist.com/china/2020/02/22/in-china-newly-confirmed-cases-of-coronavirus-infection-are-falling) )

Right now Xi is trying to get the factories back in production and considering the circumstances they're doing quite well (some provinces have 90%+ of their businesses and factories reopened) (source - [https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2020/02/25/as-its-covid-19-epidemic-slows-china-tries-to-get-back-to-work](https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2020/02/25/as-its-covid-19-epidemic-slows-china-tries-to-get-back-to-work) ). We only lost a few weeks of production (which could potentially be made up for) and a few weeks of consumer/business demand (demand will shift from Jan and Feb to March and April). Unless a companies quarter ends in March or earlier you'll be fine.

- the first case was a [78yo man](https://www.corriere.it/cronache/20_febbraio_22/coronavirus-italia-nuovi-contagi-lombardia-veneto-245e72d4-5540-11ea-8418-2150c9ca483e_preview.shtml?reason=unauthenticated&cat=1&cid=-sJ0dz5k&pids=FR&credits=1&origin=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.corriere.it%2Fcronache%2F20_febbraio_22%2Fcoronavirus-italia-nuovi-contagi-lombardia-veneto-245e72d4-5540-11ea-8418-2150c9ca483e.shtml) from the suburban area of Milan that was hospitalized for 5 days in a hospital in the city before he tested positive. No news of him infecting someone came out.
- a [soldier stationed in the city](https://www.secoloditalia.it/2020/02/il-coronavirus-attacca-lesercito-contagiato-un-militare-a-milano-ora-gli-agenti-in-strada-sono-preoccupati/) resulted positive,but since his residence is in Cremona, article tell us We shouldn't worry about it
- a dermatologist resulted positive, and short after [two collegues](https://milano.corriere.it/notizie/cronaca/20_febbraio_25/coronavirus-milano-nuovi-contagi-policlinico-positivi-due-medici-1a37073e-57bc-11ea-a2d7-f1bec9902bd3.shtml) resulted positive too

The total should be 5 cases. No discussion about finding out how and if the cases are related and where did they come from is made.

I live in the city and tomorrow I have a medical appointment for unrelated reasonsin a private clinic. The clinic called me today and told me I had to move my visit because the government asked them to free ambulatories from 2pm.

Not even close. 

The spanish flu infected about 500 million people and killed about 50 million, with some estimates going as high as 100 million. That makes the fatality rate 10% at best, and 20% at worst. ^1

It's too soon to get an exact fatality rate for Corvid-19, but the best estimate is probably around 2-3% (and no that's not just based on possibly manipulated data from China, the numbers from other countries look roughly similar if not lower although it has to be noted that the total number of cases elsewhere is too low to be conclusive), but the real number could very well be lower given how many cases there are that go unnoticed because the infected show either none or just minor symptoms. ^2

Might have something to do with the mass knife attacks we saw in the 1990s and mid 2000's.  Chinese aren't immune to stereotypes just as other humans.  The East Turkestan Militia or whatever it was called was going around killing people and a lot of Chinese saw all Uyghurs as a big problem.  Urumqi was definitely not a safe place 15 years ago.

Hell, even know people are talking about racism because of the new coronavirus.  Human beings aren't that advanced."

(Alleged) email sent out by UC Davis Health CEO to UC Davis 

Says a patient was transferred there on Feb. 19 from another hospital (probably Solano county where case originated) bc of “undiagnosed & suspected viral condition”.  ( Patient already intubated & on ventilator) 

Team at UC Davis inquires with health officials if case could be COVID-19 - was denied testing by CDC as patient did not fit all CDC requirements. 

Come Sunday feb. 23rd, CDC gives the go to order a test (probably bc now patient fits requirements) 
Today, feb. 26th, confirmed positive. 

If this is how events played out, explains why they finally went ahead and tested. Sure we’ll hear more"

In a briefing on Tuesday (Feb 25), Dr Song Tie, deputy director of the Guangdong Centre of Disease Control and Prevention, reportedly said there is no clear conclusion on why this happens and whether such patients could still be infectious.

According to Caixin, Dr Song said that from preliminary assessments, experts believe these patients were still recovering from lung infections and were not yet fully healthy.

At the same briefing, Dr Li Yueping from the Guangzhou No.8 People's Hospital in Guangdong province reportedly said the hospital had found 13 discharged patients who tested positive again, although none showed renewed symptoms. Tests for the virus on close contacts of the patients were also negative.

Dr Cai Weiping from the same hospital reportedly said that the positive results were found using anal swabs, a method of testing that is rarely used in other parts of China.

China’s national treatment guidelines only require tests from throat or nose swabs, as the virus is believed to spread mainly through respiratory droplets, although some research has found that the virus could be transmitted through human faeces.

Dr Cai said that it is still unclear whether the virus detected in recovered patients is still active and there could be a discrepancy in the samples, reported Caixin.

Dr Song reportedly added that the patients who tested positive again would be placed under concentrated observation, and that health authorities would step up monitoring of discharged patients.

Similar cases of patients testing positive after being discharged have been reported in other parts of China.

In Wuhan, the city at the epicentre of the outbreak, authorities introduced a mandatory 14-day quarantine on Saturday for recovered patients after some tested positive after being discharged, reported the South China Morning Post.

Cases of patients testing positive for the virus after being discharged were also found in the city of Chengdu as well as Hainan province in China.

According to China’s national treatment guidelines, patients are considered to have recovered from Covid-19 and can be discharged from hospital when their throat or nose swabs are negative in two consecutive tests, when their CT scans indicate no lung lesions and when they are free from symptoms such as fever.

Discharged patients are then asked to monitor their health, limit outdoor activities and to undergo retests in the following weeks. AGENCIES

2020-02-26,Taellion,Coronavirus,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/fa4j2x/can_someone_explain_what_the_big_deal_is/fivutls/,"The virulence (R0) of SARS-CoV-2 is estimated between 1.4-6.49, with a mean estimate of 3.28[[1](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/coronavirus-may-spread-faster-than-who-estimate#Higher-estimates-than-WHO-predict)] . This mean estimate is much higher than the seasonal flu, which has an R0 of 1.3[[2](https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2020/01/how-fast-and-far-will-new-coronavirus-spread/605632/)] . What this means is that SARS-CoV-2 spreads signficantly faster than the seasonal flu. 

 1. The Case Fatality Rate (CFR) of SARS-CoV-2 is at least 2-3%[[3](https://academic.oup.com/ajcp/advance-article/doi/10.1093/ajcp/aqaa029/5735509)] . This is 20-30 times higher than the CFR of the season flu, which is around .1%[[4](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/02/03/the-flu-has-already-killed-10000-across-us-as-world-frets-over-coronavirus.html)] . 

 2. SARS-CoV-2 can be transmitted without the infected showing any symptoms[[5](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2762028)] . This makes it much more difficult to control. 

 3. Roughly 20% of SARS-CoV-2 infections result in serious symptoms that require medical intervention[[6](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/coronavirus-81-of-cases-are-mild-study-says#80.9%-of-the-cases-are-mild)] . This is more than 10 times the hospitalization rate of the seasonal flu[[7](https://www.cdc.gov/flu/about/burden/index.html)].

 4. Symptoms from SARS-CoV-2 can persist over a month[[8](https://www.thelancet.com/pb-assets/Lancet/pdfs/S2213260020300795.pdf)] compared to the seasonal flu where symptoms typically tend to clear after 5 days[[9](https://www.emedicinehealth.com/flu_in_adults/article_em.htm)] .

 5. There is no vaccine for SARS-CoV-2[[10](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/about/prevention-treatment.html)] whereas people regularly get annual flu shots. 

 6. There is no [herd immunity](https://www.ovg.ox.ac.uk/news/herd-immunity-how-does-it-work) for SARS-CoV-2 which means that it can theoretically infect the entire population. See, for example, a [Korean psychiatric department where the virus infected 99/102 people](https://twitter.com/covid_19news/status/1231581727438467072?s=21). 

Now, consider the multiplicative effect that all of these attributes have for the virus. Compared to the seasonal flu, SARS-CoV-2 (1) spreads faster; (2) kills far more; (3) is harder to control; (4) requires use of far more medical resources; (5) for far longer a period of time; (6) has no effective treatment; and (7) can infect entire populations. 

These factors mean that SARS-CoV-2, if left unchecked, is far more likely to overwhelm a country's medical infrastructure. Additionally, when medical infrastructure is overwhelmed, the CFR will skyrocket because we know that 20% of cases require medical intervention. 

This virus is potentially devastating if containment measures fail. Far worse than the seasonal flu.

2020-02-26,bippityboppityFyou,Wuhan_Flu,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/Wuhan_Flu/comments/f9u1o5/im_a_nurse_and_we_are_not_ready/fiuxu0f/,"My hospital (in the US) has been overrun with just our normal winter illnesses. The ED goes on red diversion fairly regularly (this means no ambulances can come to our ED unless they are a stroke, heart attack, or trauma since we are designated as those centers). We are in gridlock because all of our inpatient beds are full so we are boarding admitted patients in the ED. When we board people in the ED it means we can’t free up those ED beds for new patients in the waiting room, and the whole flow of the hospital stops. It’s been this way since mid-November. I’m in a major city, I’ve never seen a winter this busy.

If coronavirus gets bad here I have no idea how sick people will get medical care. We are already at max capacity, staff is already picking up overtime. We have a finite number of nurses and doctors, we have a finite number of beds and rooms. If there is a huge surge in patients, I don’t know what we would do because we can’t just pull those resources out of nowhere.

I have heard nothing from my hospital about how to manage these patients. The only thing I’ve heard is that there is a shortage of face masks and we need to “conserve them.” With Ebola they asked for staff to volunteer to be part of the response team- these volunteers were taught how to properly put on and take off isolation gear and how to care for those people and prevent the spread of the virus. We never had to activate that team, but at least they had a plan and people were educated. Now we are told by the CDC that it’s”not it but when” coronavirus arrives and we have heard absolutely nothing. 

I can tell you that if staff fear for their safety at work because we aren’t educated on how to protect ourselves and aren’t given the proper PPE, then a lot of staff won’t come in. They will be thinking “if I go to work and catch this I have a statistically significant chance of dying and/or infecting my spouse and kids. I’d rather just quit.” I’m not saying that’s right, but I’m saying people have an innate sense of self-preservation. If staff don’t come to work then there’s no one to care for the sick and then those patients can die. All I want to hear is what I need to do to protect myself at work so that I can protect my family and my other patients. If my hospital doesn’t provide information and PPE, I will always choose my kids safety and health over my job. It’s time hospitals step up and start communicating"

-----------------------------------------------

Dr. Pierre Talbot of the Institut national de la recherche scientifique in Laval, a scientist who has worked with the coronavirus for more than 30 years and an acknowledged expert in the field, said in an interview Monday that he believes the epidemic will be contained within the next few weeks.

The Chinese response to the epidemic has been “amazingly thorough,” with major cities in Hubei province, where the virus originated, locked down, he said. In countries including Canada, where two cases of the new virus have been identified in Toronto and there could be more, measures are in place in airports and hospitals to identify people who have the virus and to isolate those who do, he said.

The influenza virus spreads far more effectively than the coronavirus, he said, with tens of thousands of people dying each year of flu. Although the death rate from influenza is “extremely variable,” it is higher than SARS.

Yet people seem anxious about the new coronavirus in a way that they do not about the flu.

**“The reaction to this new coronavirus is strange, to my mind,”**Talbot said.

-  He own a boxing gym, where he acts as a [2nd for matches](https://www.reddit.com/r/hajimenoippo/comments/e3xg2q/miscmorikawa_working_as_a_2nd/).  Some of his boxers have been lucky to have title matches, where he been involved with it.  Right now, he has two boxers with a OPBF title defense happening in the next few months, and one boxer is going to fight for the JBC title in April.  However, those might get delay since the JBC decided to suspend all the boxing matches in Japan during March because of Coronavirus.

- Morikawa made a few poster/artworks that probably requires sometime to do.
Examples - [Ring Magazine cover](https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/ippo/images/3/3f/Morikawa_-_The_Ring_-_Naoya_Inoue.png/revision/latest?cb=20190708200902), [G-shock](https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/ippo/images/5/5b/G-Shock_Watches_ad_-_Poster_-_01.png/revision/latest?cb=20200222164116), Stage Play poster, M-League related stuff, [Book Cover](https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/ippo/images/3/31/Morikawa_-_2020_-_Ken_Sonoda_and_Zero_-_Booklet.png/revision/latest?cb=20200124180007), and [other stuff](https://ippo.fandom.com/wiki/Morikawa_Jouji/Artwork).

Then Morikawa been doing stuff for the [30th Anniversary](https://ippo.fandom.com/wiki/Morikawa_Jouji/30th_Anniversary), where he does stuff for it.  Examples:

- [Featherweight Boxing Tournament](https://ippo.fandom.com/wiki/Hajime_no_Ippo_30th_Anniversary_Featherweight_Tournament) that he sponsored.  Started on November 19, Semi-Final is tomorrow (Feb 27) and Finals in May.

- [Art Exhibit](https://ippo.fandom.com/wiki/Hajime_no_Ippo_Art_Exhibit) in Tokyo (Nov 16 to December 1st).  Where Morikawa did a live drawing/autograph session.  Then from Feb 22 to April 12, it will run in Ishinomaki City, where Morikawa expected to do things for it too.

- [Stage Play](https://ippo.fandom.com/wiki/Real_Fighting_Hajime_no_Ippo:_The_Glorious_Stage!!) 1/30/2020 to 2/9/2020, where Morikawa attended a few shows, and took part in the after show session.

Then Morikawa been doing Mahjong stuff lately, where he done games and an online video thing, where that takes up his time too.

He probably does other stuff that we don't know about yet, but might find out about in a few weeks or months later.  

He has been sick in the past, but the last two year, it seems like he been trying to take care of himself.  Where he lost weight, or been looking better."

Critics, though, are pointing out that money might not be necessary if the administration hadn’t spent the past two years largely dismantling government units that were designed to protect against pandemics.

> The cuts started in 2018, as the White House focused on eliminating funding to Obama-era disease security programs. In March of that year, Rear Adm. Timothy Ziemer, whose job it was to lead the U.S. response in the event of a pandemic, abruptly left the administration and his global health security team was disbanded.

> That same year, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) was forced to slash its efforts to prevent global disease outbreak by 80% as its funding for the program began to run out. The agency, at the time, opted to focus on 10 priority countries and scale back in others, including China.

> Also cut was the Complex Crises Fund, a $30 million emergency response pool that was at the secretary of state’s disposal to deploy disease experts and others in the event of a crisis. (The fund was created by former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.)

> Overall in 2018, Trump called for $15 billion in reduced health spending that had previously been approved, as he looked at increasing budget deficits, cutting the global disease-fighting budgets of the CDC, National Security Council (NSC), Department of Homeland Security (DHS), and Health and Human Services (HHS) in the process.

A case in California may be the first infection without a known link to travel abroad.

By Roni Caryn Rabin

Feb. 26, 2020

Updated 9:03 p.m. ET

A person in California who was not exposed to anyone known to be infected with the coronavirus, and had not traveled to countries in which the virus is circulating, has tested positive for the infection.

It may be the first case of community spread in the United States, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said on Wednesday.

“At this point, the patient’s exposure is unknown,” the C.D.C. statement said. “The case was detected through the U.S. public health system and picked up by astute clinicians.”

The case was announced shortly after President Trump concluded a news briefing in which he said that aggressive public health containment measures and travel entry restrictions had successfully limited the spread of coronavirus in the United States.

It brings the number of cases in the country to 60, including the 45 cases among Americans who were repatriated from Wuhan, China — the epicenter of the outbreak — and the Diamond Princess cruise ship, which was overwhelmed by the virus after it docked in Japan.

The Coronavirus Outbreak

Answers to your most common questions:

&#x200B;

Updated Feb. 26, 2020

What is a Coronavirus?

It is a novel virus named for the crown-like spikes that protrude from its surface. The coronavirus can infect both animals and people, and can cause a range of respiratory illnesses from the common cold to more dangerous conditions like Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome, or SARS.

How worried should I be?

New outbreaks in Asia, Europe and the Middle East are renewing fears of a global pandemic. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention warned this week that Americans should brace for the likelihood that the virus will spread to the United States.

How do I keep myself and others safe?

Washing your hands frequently is the most important thing you can do, along with staying at home when you’re sick.

What if I’m traveling?

The C.D.C. has warned older and at-risk travelers to avoid Japan, Italy and Iran. The agency also has advised against all non-essential travel to South Korea and China.

How can I prepare for a possible outbreak?

Keep a 30-day supply of essential medicines. Get a flu shot. Have essential household items on hand. Have a support system in place for eldery family members.

Where has the virus spread?

The virus, which originated in Wuhan, China, has sickened more than 80,000 people in at least 33 countries, including Italy, Iran and South Korea.

How contagious is the virus?

According to preliminary research, it seems moderately infectious, similar to SARS, and is probably transmitted through sneezes, coughs and contaminated surfaces. Scientists have estimated that each infected person could spread it to somewhere between 1.5 and 3.5 people without effective containment measures.

Who is working to contain the virus?

The World Health Organization officials have been working with officials in China, where growth has slowed. But this week, as confirmed cases spiked on two continents, experts warned that the world is not ready for a major outbreak.

Until now, public health officials have been able to trace all of the infections in the country to a recent trip abroad or a known patient, and to identify the sources of exposure.

Though C.D.C. officials said it was possible the patient was exposed to a returning traveler who was infected, the new case appears to be one of community spread — one in which the source of infection is unknown.

“The thing that would immediately make all of us uneasy is if this person has no direct contact with someone who comes from an affected country,” said Dr. William Schaffner, an infectious disease specialist at Vanderbilt University.

“That would suggest there are other undetected cases out there, and we have already started some low-grade transmission.”

Public health officials said the infected individual was a resident of Solano County, Calif., and was receiving medical care in Sacramento County, but they have not disclosed any other information to protect the patient’s privacy.

Doctors in the patient’s community may want to expand testing for the coronavirus among their patients in order to identify other infected individuals there, Dr. Schaffner said.

“Physicians are going to want to start testing everybody with a fever and a cough,” he said. “They’re going to want to do that and the patients are going to want to do that.”

Right now, however, testing capacity is limited in the United States.

The C.D.C. developed a diagnostic test and distributed testing kits to local health departments around the country.

But the kits were flawed, and the agency must manufacture new ones. Although a dozen states are capable of testing for coronavirus infection, confirmatory tests must still be done by the C.D.C., a process that can take days.

Every country except those with active infection tests based on similar criteria.  The US and EU have similar criteria.   Read it yourself!   

Now China is testing people IN THEIR COUNTRY that present with symptoms because they know they had a problem.   South Korea wasn't testing until they had a problem.  And now they are only testing those who had contact with a person who tested positive.  They are not testing everyone.  

So what do you propose?    Do you want us all to line up at our local hospital every morning before work for the next 8 months so they can test every single person one every day.

> Coronavirus Test Kits Sent to States Are Flawed, C.D.C. Says
Some tests distributed by the agency deliver “inconclusive” readings. The C.D.C. will need to ship new ingredients, further delaying results.

Some of the coronavirus testing kits sent to state laboratories around the country have flaws and do not work properly, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said on Wednesday.
The kits were meant to enable states to conduct their own testing and have results faster than they would by shipping samples to the C.D.C. in Atlanta. But the failure of the kits meant that states that encountered problems with the test should not use it, and would still have to depend on the C.D.C.’s central lab, which could cause several days’ delay in getting results.

“Obviously, a state wouldn’t want to be doing this test and using it to make clinical decisions if it isn’t working as well, as perfectly, at the state as it is at C.D.C.,” Dr. Nancy Messonnier, director of the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, said at a news conference on Wednesday.

The C.D.C. recommends testing for people who have symptoms like fever, cough or shortness of breath, and who, within the past 14 days, have traveled to China or have been in close contact with someone who is infected with the coronavirus. Doctors with patients in that category are supposed to consult their state health department about whether the individuals should be tested for the virus.

LIVE UPDATESRead the latest developments in the coronavirus outbreak here.
The C.D.C. announced late Wednesday that another evacuee quarantined at a military base in California had tested positive for coronavirus. The latest individual who was diagnosed among the evacuees from Wuhan, the epicenter of the outbreak, brings the total of confirmed cases to 14 in the United States. A previous case was diagnosed at the Miramar base in San Diego on Sunday.

The first and second patients arrived on different planes and were housed in separate facilities at Miramar, according to the C.D.C. Dr. Chris Braden, an expert on the site, said in a statement that “At this time there is no indication of person-to-person spread of this virus at the quarantine facility, but C.D.C. will carry out a thorough contact investigation as part of its current response strategy to detect and contain any cases of infection with this virus.”

Who is working to contain the virus?
The World Health Organization officials have been working with officials in China, where growth has slowed. But this week, as confirmed cases spiked on two continents, experts warned that the world is not ready for a major outbreak.
The C.D.C. announced last week that it had begun shipping about 200 kits to laboratories in the United States and roughly 200 more to labs in more than 30 other countries. Each kit can test about 700 to 800 specimens from patients, the agency said.

Kits were shipped to every state, but officials did not say how many of the kits were faulty.

At a news conference on Wednesday morning, Dr. Messonnier said that test kits had been shipped to more than 30 other countries, but later in the day said that she was mistaken, and that the international shipments had been held back because of the flaw.


Before the kits were shipped to the states, Dr. Messonnier had emphasized repeatedly at news conferences that the kits would not go out until the C.D.C. was sure they were as accurate as possible.

Dr. Jeanne Marrazzo, director of the infectious diseases division at the University of Alabama at Birmingham, said accurate diagnostic tests were invaluable.

“The test is the only way you can definitely know you have the infection,” Dr. Marrazzo said. “You absolutely need it for case counting. It allows you to know who’s infected. You can treat those people, if a treatment is available, and you can isolate them.”

Doctors in China said there was an urgent need for a simpler, quicker diagnostic test, officials from the World Health Organization said during a news briefing on Wednesday.

On trial runs in some states, the C.D.C. kits produced results that were “inconclusive,” Dr. Messonnier said. The tests did not involve samples from potential patients, but were part of the routine quality-control procedures that labs followed before using a test to make real diagnoses.

“Things may not always go as smoothly as we may like,” Dr. Messonnier said.

The problem appeared to come from one ingredient involved in the test, Dr. Messonnier said, adding that the C.D.C. would make a new supply of that ingredient to send to all of the laboratories. Officials did not say when the ingredient would be shipped, but said the process was being expedited and the material would be made available as soon as possible.

States that did not have trouble with the kits could keep using them, Kristen Nordlund, a spokeswoman for the C.D.C., said, adding that those states would still receive the newly made ingredient from the agency.

The flawed test kits are a separate issue from the mislabeled samples in San Diego that had led officials to discharge a woman, who was sick from the coronavirus, from a hospital.

More than 1,380 people have died, nearly all of them in China, where there are more than 55,000 confirmed cases.

The C.D.C. does not recommend testing for people who may have been exposed to the virus but have no symptoms. Even if they are infected, if they are still in the incubation period, there may not be enough virus in their bodies for the test to detect.

The inability to detect very early infections is one reason for keeping planeloads of people from Wuhan in quarantine instead of just testing them and letting them go if the results are negative. A person could test negative and still be infected.

For the same reason, health authorities say there is no benefit to testing symptom-free people on cruise ships.

Because there is an unknown window of time between when a person becomes infected and when the test can find the virus, health officials have determined that a quarantine of two weeks — believed to be the incubation period of the illness — is the best way to make sure that people who may be infected do not transmit the virus to others.

Tests for other infectious diseases can also fail to detect some cases. A panel of tests used to screen for respiratory viruses when pneumonia is suspected can give negative results even if a patient is infected, Dr. Marrazzo said. So can rapid tests for flu and strep throat. Blood tests for H.I.V. can miss the diagnosis in people who were recently infected."
