The problem with being a patient in the front of this disease is you get treated like an idiot by doctors.

No.  If you tell them you think it is Covid19, do you think they will laugh at you?  Yeah probably.

Yesterday a guy showed symptoms and they tested him for Covid, test came back as positive. They've been tracking down every single person he had any contact with, even in different regions, and this is why they found so many people in such a short timespan. Same thing happened in a different region (Veneto) even though the number of confirmed cases isn't as big as Lombardy's. 

No one knows who the first patient is, they're tracking them down, but they pretty much have no clue.

What I'm trying to say is, up until now western countries were doing a piss poor job at trying to discover who could have been infected. For all we know Canada might have more infected than Italy, or we might all have been infected at some point but our immune system managed to fight it off, nobody knows and nobody will until western countries get their shit together and start treating this as a serious issue.

Here in Italy the virus has pretty much become the priority #1 f or the government, everything else has been put aside and the media **only** talks about the virus.

Globalization currently is largely about wealthy nations exploiting the poor worker's rights of poorer nations.

Instead of globalization allowing nations to find production niches that can then be sold globally, it is currently centralizing production in poorer nations at an artificially low price and unsustainable rate.

Everything isn't made in China and India because it is the best place to manufacture these items. They are produced there because of the poverty and huge populations creating a workforce that can be financially exploited for their work. Creating an unsustainable system where production gets concentrated in the countries that has the lowest protections for its workers.

Poverty, population density, and lack of education is what drives these outbreaks.

We need higher standards for the nations we allow to participate in the global market."

But many msm science and medical professionals think 2% or higher is also likely. 

Also its CAR (case attack rate) is possibly as high as 60-80% which will overwhelm medical systems very quickly, thus increasing the CFR in regions where this happens due to 20% of infected being classed as ""serious"" or ""critical"".

It was grim.

It has a CFR of only 0.075%.

This from the New York Times

>Government statistics released this week showed that 102 people in  England and Wales died of illnesses related to flu in the first week of  December, bringing the total such deaths so far this year to 276. In the  corresponding week last year, there were seven flu-related deaths.

Mortality is more like 0.05% for 30 and under, possibly lower if we could properly count all the mild cases circulating. But don’t kid yourself, it is certainly more deadly than the flu.

I don’t disagree with those scenarios but they will play out over months and years.  Remember this was thought to have started in mid November with the first cases maturing in early December. So it took a month or two to overtake Wuhan and spread in China.

We can slow it down, but we can’t stop it.

""low probability of dying""
Age. 2-5% under 30 yr olds over 15% for over 60 years old. (Don't quote me on the numbers). Pair with high infectivity, that is high overall.

Mutate?
Yes.

Cure?
1 year minimum.

What are the most likely scenarios?

- 60% of the population infected.
- health care systems overwhelmed, cure only critical cases (at best)
- the rest infected: stay at home and pray

- world economic recession
- production disrupted
- perhaps (distribution) food shortages"

It’s just too dangerous to rely on one single country/source for the vast majority of products or parts of products... as we are learning first-hand.

We were trained to sing our hymns loudly.”

Many outbreaks of COVID-19 right now around the world are in a stage where we don’t have knowledge of all cases so it is much too early to tell for them.

As for the released patients It’s seeming like hospitalization is based on severity. They’re still a threat to the population but since their symptoms don’t really require intensive care they are sent off to just let the immune system do it’s job. It’s happening because hospitals are so overwhelmed. They need to mainly focus on cases which are very severe since without medical intervention the chances of death are even higher."

2020-02-22,Mook1971,Coronavirus,8,https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/f81nfj/infections_increase_among_repatriated_cruise_ship/fii9hrc/,"Twenty-eight U.S. residents flown home from the Diamond Princess cruise ship are infected with coronavirus, and health officials expect to see more positive cases among the evacuated passengers in coming days, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said Friday.
The passengers from the ship, along with three infected people previously returned from Wuhan, China, bring the total number of evacuees with the virus in the United States to 31. An additional 13 people in the United States either picked up the infection by traveling to China or from close contact with a family member who had been in China.
The passengers, who had been quarantined aboard the cruise ship in Japan, are “considered at high risk of infection and we do expect to see additional cases,” Nancy Messonnier, director of the CDC’s National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, said in a media briefing.
AD
The sharp rise in the number of U.S. patients came on a day of grim news about the spread of covid-19, the viral respiratory disease that has afflicted more than 76,000 people and killed more than 2,300, mainly in China.
The number of cases in South Korea surged to 346, with more than half linked to a secretive religious movement with a messianic leader. Iran confirmed 18 cases, including four deaths, centered in Qom, a Shiite holy city south of Tehran. In Beijing, two hospitals were put under quarantine amid fears of a coronavirus outbreak in China’s capital, with one district reporting an “infection density” second only to Wuhan, the epicenter of the epidemic.
Messonnier said 18 of the Americans who were quarantined aboard the Diamond Princess in Yokohama harbor had positive results in CDC tests. Ten others were positive in tests conducted by the Japanese. The CDC won’t formally add those people to its count until U.S. tests confirm the findings, but Messonnier announced them Friday.
AD
The Japanese government quarantined 3,700 passengers and crew members aboard the Diamond Princess for nearly two weeks, a decision that allowed the virus to sweep through the ship, which one Japanese expert has said was plagued by poor infection control. Now, 634 of those onboard have tested positive — the second-
largest number in any place outside China.
Last weekend, the State Department flew 329 U.S. residents home from the ship on two chartered flights. The Washington Post reported Thursday that the evacuation was delayed for hours by a last-minute disagreement among government officials. As the passengers arrived at the airport in buses, test results came back indicating 14 people waiting to evacuate were infected with coronavirus.
CDC officials did not want to put sick people on the plane with uninfected passengers, but they were overruled by the State Department and another top government health official.
AD
At Friday’s briefing, Ian Brownlee, principal deputy assistant secretary in the State Department’s Bureau of Consular Affairs, said the tests for those 14 people were conducted 48 to 72 hours before they boarded the buses, indicating they were infected on the ship.
A plane carrying 129 Canadians and their family members from the Diamond Princess also arrived in Canada on Friday.
It’s not clear where all the infected Americans are being treated. Eleven are receiving care at the University of Nebraska Medical Center. Five are receiving care at hospitals around Travis Air Force Base near Sacramento, where one plane landed, and two are being treated near Lackland Air Force Base near San Antonio, where the other flight arrived.
Dozens of other Americans from the cruise ship who tested positive were taken off the ship before the evacuation and are still in Japanese hospitals. They include Wayne and Susan Hidalgo of Kansas City, Kan., who wondered why the ship continued to allow people to mingle freely onboard, even after a passenger onboard was diagnosed with the virus. One of the people Wayne Hidalgo regularly dined with had shared a bus with the infected passenger.
AD
“As time went on, after a day or so, I wondered, why are we eating dinner with these people? Why is everybody out dancing? Why are they having these shows going on?” the 77-year-old said in a telephone interview from his hospital bed in Tokyo.
Japan’s Health Ministry said 88 Americans aboard the ship have been diagnosed with covid-19. Most have been taken to hospitals on land.
The Hidalgos’ children want them brought home, arguing that it’s “not fair” they’ve been left in Japan while other Americans were evacuated. Wayne Hidalgo said he knows the couple can’t leave until they are given the all-clear by Japanese doctors. They each need two consecutive negative tests.
Wayne Hidalgo said he is suffering from mild pneumonia and has been put on oxygen, but had only a fleeting fever. He’s taking antibiotics, but doctors haven’t felt it necessary to put him on anti-viral medication given to the most severely ill patients. Susan Hidalgo has no symptoms.
AD
Wayne Hidalgo said he has become “more and more confident” with the medical care he is receiving as time goes by, and is “totally impressed” with his hospital, his doctor — who speaks fluent English — and nurses who are “wonderful and funny.”
“Susan, my wife, and I have both accepted the fact that we’ve got to stay mentally healthy, and exercise some, and stay here,” he said.
An official from the U.S. Embassy has visited, bringing them clothes and local currency, while Princess Cruises, the cruise line that operates the ship, has been in contact every day.
On Feb. 1, a Diamond Princess passenger from Hong Kong, who had left the ship Jan. 25, was diagnosed with the virus. Princess Cruises said it learned about this on social media the next day and reached out to Hong Kong authorities. On Feb. 3, the captain told passengers the ship would wait in Yokohama while Japanese Health Ministry officials assessed the situation. But passengers still mingled, including at a buffet dinner on Feb. 4. It was only later they were told to stay in their cabins.
AD
John Haering, 63, from Tooele, Utah, said he came down with a fever that reached 103.6 degrees on Feb. 10, but was not seen by a doctor until 5 p.m. the following day. For 2 ½ days, his wife, Melanie, put wet cloths on his forehead to keep him cool, replacing them every 20 minutes.
He wasn’t evacuated from the ship to a Tokyo hospital until Feb. 13. His fever had subsided by then. He has been in isolation ever since, with very little human contact. He takes his own temperature, and meals are passed through a stainless-steel cabinet with doors on two sides. Once a day, a nurse in full protective gear comes in to clean his room.
He said he has received just one phone call from the U.S. Embassy and no contact with Carnival Corp., the British-American company based in Doral, Fla., that owns Princess Cruises.
AD
“I have, as my doctor described it, bad pneumonia. I’m fighting each day to stay positive and healthy,” he said. “I don’t need the uncertainty of what will happen to me weighing on my thoughts.”
In a statement, the U.S. State Department said “the welfare and safety of U.S. citizens abroad” is one of its highest priorities, including providing “all appropriate consular assistance” to U.S. citizens remaining in Japan, and visiting those who have been hospitalized from the Diamond Princess.
But Haering said he needs much more information.
“I’m worried and scared and frustrated with what I have seen and NOT heard so far,” he said in a statement.
Denyer reported from Yokohama. Lena Sun in Washington, Amanda Coletta in Toronto, Anna Fifield in Beijing and Min Joo Kim in Seoul contributed to this report."

I guess it does as this is a proven perception phenomenon. Whenever new and interesting things happen, we save more moments of these time periods into our long term memory, thus we have access to a longer list of memories which makes the time feel much longer. And as a child you'll experience much more things that are new to you than when you're older. Now the COVID situation is new and very intense to most of us people following these subs, so the same phenomenon will apply."

* The article states ""that tests are arranged""

* Per their website, they have tested some 500+ cases
* But this article as many have known says we have ""thousands in monitoring"" 
* The public was told testing would be pushed out on 2/5, it wasn't. 
* We are not told what the daily capacity of testing is at the CDC but we are told its essentially unlimited and no gaps. 
* Why is it crazy to think that ""anyone who makes the qualification of needing monitoring"" should be tested?
* The CDC could state (hypothetically), there are \~7,000 person's of interest being self quarantined throughout the US.  We have tested 500 of them, we are testing 2000 of them per day and will have a handle on this in 3 days...
* Then (hypothetically) follow it up with, the reagents will be in the 100 distributed local labs by March 1st, until then, we will use all the testing capacity we have at the CDC.

There are some biological differences between people of differing skin color - namely, their skin color genes are different, maybe their eye color genes. But immune system genes tend to pretty well conserved between all humans (there might be slight differences between all non-Sub-Saharan Africans and Sub-Saharan Africans, because of admixture with neanderthals and denisovans in the non-SSA).

The biological differences between ethnicities boils down to mutations in non-coding sections rather than genes (there might be a handful of genes that differ in relatively isolated populations, but what is that out of 25k genes?). Non-coding sections are more likely to mutate than genes and not spread out of isolated populations because they aren't as important for survival as genes are.

Viruses don't attack non-coding sections of genes, they attack cells via receptor sites on the cell walls, so it's difficult for me to imagine genes that target ""race.""

So I don't believe so. I see no reason that people will differ at the cellular level because of their apparent, socialized race.

Keep in mind, there are differences in health outcomes because of all kinds of social reasons, like racism, stress, poverty, lack of access to healthcare. These wear down the body and immune system and make infections easier to catch and more deadly. So if everyone caught the disease, those at the bottom will suffer disproportionately. And if those people are of a ""race,"" then it will certainly look like their race is being targeted by the disease."

There is no wtf. This is the US government intentionally hiding that fact that the virus is in the US now and spreading.  This is their strategy to reduce panic.   

It's super obvious. The heads of the US CDC have said it's already here and will spread in the US.  

Just the general public is in denial because they see the small number infected officially and don't see the spread in the US on the news.   

Over 6000 in the US are in quarantine.  Clearly there are 30+ cases in the US and soon we will have over 100. In a few months it will be in the thousands and go above 100,000 infected here.  This is literally what the CDC chiefs are saying. But again, US government is hiding the numbers, and US media is not reporting this story.  

The US should be doing what other countries are doing, but they are not.  Saying it is inevitable that it will be widespread here."

This sub seems to love to say there are a) tons of mild and asymptomatic cases unaccounted as people don’t seek help yet spread and b) a higher death rate. And a+b is impossible, cases the mild cases should be added before counting mortality rate, so it woukd drive the rate significantly down.

So there are two options: either we know about most of the cases, and than with a mortality rate of about 2% it’s significantly worse than the flu, so we should exercise caution. Or there are tons, maybe millions as some say of mild cases, which would drag mortality down to flu levels and it would be just another bug we have to learn to live with."
