Emergency rooms represent a busy intake point for hospitals, where patients come in with symptoms but no diagnosis. As the coronavirus spreads during the typical flu season, emergency physicians are triaging large numbers of patients around the country with symptoms that could be the virus.

From Berkeley economist and AER co-editor Pierre-Olivier Gourinchas ([see: flattening the pandemic and recession curves](https://sites.google.com/view/pgourinchas/home)):

>	In a perfect world, people would self-isolate until infection rates decline sufficiently and public health authorities give the all-clear. At that point, the economic engines would re-start: workers would go back to work, factories would turn back on, ships would load their cargo and planes would take off.

>	The first thing to note is that, even in that perfect world, the economic damage would be considerable. To see this, assume that, relative to a baseline, containment measures reduce economic activity by 50% for one month and 25% for another month, after which the economy returns to the baseline. Such a sharp but short-lived decline in activity does not seem unreasonable if one thinks that a majority of the labor force is currently shuttered at home in places like Italy or China. In fact, we could anticipate a much more drawn out process. **Yet, that scenario would still deliver a massive blow to headline GDP numbers, with a decline in annual output growth of the order of 6.5% relative to the previous year.** 

>	Extend the 25% shutdown for just another month and the decline in annual output growth (relative to the previous year) reaches almost 10%! As a number of economists have pointed out, most of this lost GDP will not be coming back, so it is reasonable to assume a return to the baseline, rather than a later surge in activity - although one could expect a post-recession surge in spending on postponed durable goods purchases. 

>	As a point of comparison, the decline in output growth in the U.S. during the 2008-09 Great Recession was around 4.5%. **We are about to witness a downturn that could dwarf the Great Recession.**

>	Why are the numbers so much larger now? The short answer is that - **even at the peak of the financial crisis when the U.S. economy was shedding jobs at the rate of 800 thousand workers per month, the vast majority of people were still employed and working.** The unemployment rate in the U.S. peaked at ""just"" 10%. By contrast, the coronavirus is creating a situation where - for a brief amount of time - 50% or more of people may not be able to work. The impact on economic activity is comparatively that much larger.

>	**Yet, this is the optimistic scenario. We do not live in the perfect world described above.** Instead, a downturn of this magnitude will send shock waves through the economy that could do serious damage. Improperly managed, the economic cost could be much larger and longer lasting."

I am an ICU RN in a large metro area in the midwest USA (>2 mil population). What I'm about to type is not true for every region or hospital, but I assume it is what is happening in most hospitals right now or over the last week and a half in the US. Our specific facility has not been hit hard (yet), only 3 patients were being ruled out in my unit when i last worked (Friday), but are not critical (I cared for one). We have a plan in place to handle the suspected increase in patients as this goes on. Most hospitals probably have plans in place to be ready to handle increased patient load. We have also implemented very strict visitation for loved ones limiting it to only a single person for the duration of the patients stay.

In the US system, the ER is going to be hit the hardest initially because too many people are going to be coming in with a cough or sore throat and no other symptoms, which in turn puts them in contact with countless other people who probably have more significant illness/injuries happening increasing their risk of severe illness. This also slows the system down.

If you have mild symptoms that are like a cold or flu. Stay home and manage it like you would a flu (rest, hydration and fever (>100.6 degrees F) management. Wash your hands and isolate yourself as best you can for the full 14 days. Call your primary MD if you are still concerned.

Only call 911 or come to the hospital if you are having severe symptoms such as shortness of breath, chest pain, intractable nausea and vomiting etc. ( [https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/symptoms-testing/symptoms.html](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/symptoms-testing/symptoms.html))

While testing is important to monitor the spread and better identify people who need to stay isolated it doesn't change anything in the management of the illness. Testing is unfortunately slow here. Hospitals in my area of the country were only testing the potential severe cases or high risk patients due to the slow turnaround on tests (in my area) and limited availability at this time (again in my area). When testing centers start opening soon (I hope), by all means go get tested there because hopefully there will be limited contact with people and you'll know if you need to isolate for the full 2 weeks and we can use that data to monitor this after the pandemic is over.

Why this is serious.

This is a time of year (in my area anyway) where hospitals are busy and often have limited beds as is, so even a 5-10% increase in bed need (especially in ICU where different training is required to safely care for severely ill people) can put a strain on the system. That is the real danger of this illness, not the illness itself (for most people).

The measures in place are not an overreaction due to how easily the virus seems to spread. 1 person at a sports event comes into contact or close proximity to 100's. They are in place to slow down the volume of patients entering the healthcare system at once. We are trying to avoid Italy's situation where a lot of people became seriously ill at once causing a significant crisis and increased mortality. They were kind of a perfect storm, but responded amazingly by locking down.

The data on this pandemic can be misleading because it is still happening and constantly changing. Like all things with humans, illness is heavily dependent on so many factors. Data is also easily manipulated and can be skewed to push any personal agenda. China is the best statistical data to look at for the general run of the illness because it started there and was reacted to as a new disease and even that mortality rate will be high because they didn't know what they were dealing with for a time.. But again too many factors effect it because air quality, age general health of population etc. impact the number of severe illnesses/deaths blah blah blah.

Anyway, stop the panic, the media did a pretty good job initially, but now are back to fear mongering and pushing agendas and creating panic. Continue to practice social distancing, isolate if ill, avoid elderly or at-risk people. Wash your hands and quit buying all the goddamned toilet paper.

Good news is that I am on a 5 day stretch off work and haven't received a single call for help from the hospital yet, so going to enjoy it while it lasts.

Throwaway account because everyone has something to say. Much love and respect to my fellow nurses and MD's dealing with, and about to deal with the progression of this, especially in Italy. Stay safe out there.

If anyone is interested I will try to update in a week if I am able to leave the hospital."

2020-03-15,Wynardtage,Coronavirus,9,https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/fj62ul/us_government_is_rolling_back_protection_for/fkl3nze/,"The Trump administration has been working to relax regulations governing America’s nursing homes, including rules meant to curb deadly infections among elderly residents.

The main federal regulator overseeing nursing homes proposed the rule changes last summer, before the coronavirus pandemic highlighted the vulnerability of nursing homes to fast-spreading diseases. The push followed a spate of lobbying and campaign contributions by people in the nursing-home industry, according to public records and interviews.

The coronavirus has killed 13 residents at a nursing home in Washington State; dozens more residents and employees there have fallen ill. Seeking to prevent further contagion, some states, including New York, have banned most nonmedical personnel from setting foot inside nursing homes and other long-term care facilities, which nationally have about 2.5 million residents.

Last July, the federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, or C.M.S., set in motion a plan to weaken rules imposed by the Obama administration that required every nursing home to employ at least one specialist in preventing infections. The proposed rules — which the agency is completing and has the power to enact — eliminate the requirement to have even a part-time infection specialist on staff. Instead, the Trump administration would require that anti-infection specialists spend “sufficient time at the facility.”

Critics say the proposed requirement is so vague that it would be essentially meaningless — and dangerous.

“It adds up to less time, less infection control,” said Anthony Chicotel, a staff lawyer for California Advocates for Nursing Home Reform. He said the proposed change was “alarming.”

Attorneys general in 17 states have called the proposed rules a threat to “the mental and physical security of some of the most vulnerable residents of our states.”

The White House referred questions to the Medicare and Medicaid agency. In an interview on Saturday, the agency’s administrator, Seema Verma, said the proposed rule changes were not about easing up on nursing homes but “about not micromanaging the process.” The proposed changes to the infection-prevention rules, she said, could actually result in a “higher level of staffing.”

“We have to make sure that our regulations are not so burdensome that they hurt the industry,” she said.

Ms. Verma emphasized that the rules were still in the proposal stage and not yet complete. “We have to make sure that we get it right for the sake of patients,” she said.

Infection-prevention specialists are supposed to ensure that employees at nursing homes properly wash their hands and follow other safety protocols. They are widely considered the front line for stopping infections, among the leading causes of deaths in nursing homes.

Each year, about 380,000 residents are killed by infections, according to the Medicare agency. Failure to prevent them is also the leading cause of citations that state inspectors bring against nursing homes.

The coronavirus has laid bare such problems, most starkly at the Life Care Center of Kirkland, Wash., where 13 residents have died after being infected with the virus, and more than a third of the facility’s roughly 180 employees have contracted the illness.

The Kirkland facility, which scored a top quality rating of five stars from the federal government, has had problems before. In April 2019, the Medicare agency wrote it up for failing to “consistently implement an effective infection control program.” In its report, the agency described the concerns of a resident’s daughter, who said that nurses allowed her mother’s heel, which had an open wound, to touch the ground, calling the practice “unhygienic.” The agency found that the facility’s shortcomings put residents “at risk for harm and transmitting/acquiring infections.” The agency, which levied a $67,000 fine, said the problems were quickly fixed.

In recent weeks, nursing home operators nationwide have been cracking down on visitors. Ronald Silva, whose company manages two dozen nursing homes in Indiana and Georgia, said his facilities began screening all workers and vendors three weeks ago.

The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services provided new guidance for nursing homes this month, telling inspectors to scrutinize whether employees were following key safety precautions, like regularly washing their hands. Vice President Mike Pence echoed that guidance, emphasizing that all federal inspectors should focus, at least for now, on making sure that facilities are working to prevent and control infections.

“We’re going to put all inspection resources, at the state level, focused on infectious disease, looking at nursing homes being a focal point of vulnerability and a vulnerable population,” Mr. Pence said at a press briefing on March 3.

Mr. Pence did not mention the Trump administration’s proposals to relax the Obama-era rules. The proposed changes are part of a broader effort by the Trump administration to unfetter businesses from regulations. In the case of nursing homes, relaxed regulations are projected to save the industry about $640 million a year, according to estimates from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid.

In its first year, the Trump administration changed how nursing homes were fined when they violated rules. Previously, they were typically penalized for every day in which a violation persisted. But the agency changed the guidance for inspectors, encouraging them to hand out a single fine — rather than a series of daily penalties — for most infractions. Under the Trump administration, the average fine imposed on a nursing home has dropped more than 30 percent from $41,260 to $28,405, according to an analysis of federal data by Kaiser Health News.

Ms. Verma said the changes to how nursing homes are fined were meant to increase consistency across the industry.

The agency also weakened a rule that would have made it easier for nursing home residents and their families to sue over claims of elder abuse, sexual harassment and wrongful death.

“Together these changes gut enforcement,” said Toby Edelman, a senior lawyer at the Center for Medicare Advocacy, a nonprofit legal assistance group for the elderly. “They are a gift to the industry.”

The administration’s moves came after intense lobbying by the nursing home industry, including by the firm run by Brian Ballard, Mr. Trump’s friend and a fund-raiser. Parlaying his personal connections to Mr. Trump, Mr. Ballard has become one of the most powerful lobbyists in Washington, with the most clients of any registered lobbyist last year, according to an analysis by the Center for Responsive Politics. His firm has lobbied on behalf of nursing homes in his home state, Florida, for years, according to public records. (He was also a lobbyist for Mr. Trump’s Florida golf course, the Doral.)

After Mr. Trump was elected, Mr. Ballard was retained by a leading trade group for the nursing home industry, the American Health Care Association. His firm, Ballard Partners, has earned $930,000 in lobbying fees from the group since Mr. Trump took office, records show.

Ms. Verma, who emphasized that she didn’t even know Mr. Ballard, said she didn’t like to hear from lobbyists. “I tell folks I am not going to meet with D.C. insiders,” she said. “I want to meet with people on the front lines.”

A spokeswoman for the nursing home trade group said that loosening the requirement to have an infections specialist on staff would allow facilities to “provide greater flexibility to meet” to thwart infections.

In November, Mr. Trump was honored by a group of nursing home operators at a fund-raising event at a packed ballroom at the InterContinental hotel in Midtown Manhattan. The event drummed up more than $3 million for his re-election campaign through a political action committee called America First Action.

Flanked by two American flags onstage, Mr. Trump singled out one of the executives, Eliezer Scheiner, who donated $750,000, the most of any attendee.

“I want to thank Eli Scheiner for doing such an incredible job,” Mr. Trump said.

Mr. Scheiner, who owns 22 nursing homes across the country, received a round of applause.

Mr. Scheiner’s nursing homes have received subpar ratings from federal regulators. Since 2017, they have been cited more than 40 times for slipshod infection control. In 2018, inspectors at one of Mr. Scheiner’s nursing homes in Balch Springs, Texas, spotted a staff member who failed to wash or sanitize her hands before cleaning a resident’s anal area. During the same inspection, another staff member was written up for allowing a resident’s feeding tube to touch the inside of a bathroom trash can.

Two years ago, Mr. Scheiner was accused of fraud by a federally appointed bankruptcy court trustee in Connecticut. The trustee accused Mr. Scheiner and his partner of transferring more than $1 million of assets out of one of their nursing home companies into other entities they controlled, a few months before the nursing home company filed for bankruptcy.

Mr. Scheiner didn’t respond to requests for comment. He and the bankruptcy trustee agreed to a settlement this year.

In addition to no longer requiring nursing homes to designate at least one part-time “infection preventionist,” the Trump administration also has proposed adjusting a requirement that facilities must assess what they might need for patient care, from staffing levels to medical equipment. Under the proposal, facilities would have to do such assessments every two years instead of every year."

**Round-up of all the actions taken by the Fed to combat virus slowdown**

The Federal Reserve on Sunday cut its federal funds rate by a full percentage point, having delivered an emergency 50 basis point rate cut earlier this month.

Here is a round up of all the actions taken by the central bank to support markets that have recently been roiled by the coronavirus outbreak and the oil price war.

1. Lowered federal funds rate to zero

2. Announced $700bn in asset purchases -- $500bn in Treasury securities and $200bn in agency backed mortgage securities

3. Depositary institutions can borrow from discount window for periods of as long as 90 days

4. Worked with five global central banks to lower pricing on US dollar liquidity swap arrangements by 25bps, effectively giving these banks access to dollars in exchange for their own currency. The actions were in coordination with central banks of Canada, England, Japan, Switzerland and the European Central Bank.

5. Said it would lower primary credit rate by 150 basis points to 0.25 per cent by March 16

6. Will reduce reserve requirement ratios to zero per cent, effective March 26

As of Saturday afternoon, there were 642 confirmed cases and 40 deaths in Washington state.

Pointing to the way the coronavirus has spread in other countries, Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease, said that the US can still expect more cases and deaths, primarily among older and vulnerable people.

""We have not yet reached our peak,"" Fauci said at a White House briefing Saturday.

As of Sunday morning, there were at least 3,010 coronavirus cases in 49 states, Puerto Rico, the US Virgin Islands and Washington DC. At least 61 people have died. West Virginia remained the only state without any confirmed cases.

With the threat of further spread on the horizon, officials across the country have imposed a slew restrictions to curb the spread of the virus. Local governments have encouraged residents to stay home and practice social distancing. Some states, including California, New York and Washington state have banned large gatherings.

Schools across the country have closed, worship services have been canceled and recreational and entertainment events are at a near-halt, bringing dramatic changes to the everyday lives of Americans.

And the restrictions and closures keep coming.

Hoboken, New Jersey, announced a citywide curfew starting Monday. Residents will be required to stay in their homes from 10 p.m. to 5 a.m., with exceptions for work, Mayor Ravinder Bhalla said.

Bars and restaurants in Hoboken won't be allowed to serve food inside their locations as of Sunday at 11 a.m. They ""will be permitted to conduct food takeout and food delivery service only,"" Bhalla said.

In Colorado, Gov. Jared Polis issued an executive order Saturday requiring downhill ski resorts close for a week due to the presence of coronavirus in the mountain communities with limited care capacity.

Polis said he was directing ""downhill ski resorts to suspend operations for one week to slow the spread of COVID-19 and conserve medical resources in our mountain communities.""

The governor said officials will continue to monitor the course of the outbreak and may amend the executive order.

And Los Angeles County will temporarily suspend all jury trials through March 30, according to a source and an internal police memo obtained by CNN. Los Angeles Police Department spokesman Josh Rubenstein confirmed the contents of the memo to CNN.

The hiatus would include the murder trial of multi-millionaire Robert Durst, pending a final approval from the judge presiding over his case.

""The courts will re-examine the suspension decision continuance prior to March 30th,"" the police memo states. ""Personnel will be resubpoenaed through the courts for new jury trial dates."""

This is the the confusing bit. After 14 days I'm no longer infectious if I had it?  I thought the 14 days was to see if symptoms show up. 

I asked healthlink but they said call back if I'm still sick after 7 days from now.

On Sunday morning, Matt Colvin, an Amazon seller outside Chattanooga, Tenn., helped volunteers from a local church load two-thirds of his stockpile of hand sanitizer and antibacterial wipes into a box truck for the church to distribute to people in need across Tennessee.

Officials from the Tennessee attorney general’s office on Sunday took the other third, which they plan to give to their counterparts in Kentucky for distribution. (Mr. Colvin and his brother Noah bought some of the supplies in Kentucky this month.)

The donations capped a tumultuous 24 hours for Mr. Colvin. On Saturday morning, The New York Times published an article about how he and his brother cleaned out stores of sanitizer and wipes in an attempt to profit off the public’s panic over the coronavirus pandemic. Mr. Colvin sold 300 bottles of hand sanitizer at a markup on Amazon before the company removed his listings and warned sellers they would be suspended for price gouging.

As a result, Mr. Colvin was sitting on an enormous cache of sanitizer and wipes while much of the country searched in vain for them.

The article immediately sparked widespread outrage, with thousands of people posting angry comments across the internet about his actions.

Many of those people also contacted Mr. Colvin directly with hate mail and death threats, while one man even banged on the door at his home late Saturday night, according to Mr. Colvin and several messages he shared with The Times.

In an hourlong interview on Sunday, Mr. Colvin expressed remorse for his actions and said that when he decided to hoard the sanitizer and wipes, he didn’t realize the gravity of the coronavirus outbreak or the severe shortage of sanitizer and wipes.

“I’ve been buying and selling things for 10 years now. There’s been hot product after hot product. But the thing is, there’s always another one on the shelf,” he said. “When we did this trip, I had no idea that these stores wouldn’t be able to get replenished.”

He said the outpouring of hate has been scary for him and his family. He said people have incessantly called his cellphone, posted his address online and sent pizzas to his home. His inbox was flooded with ugly messages, he said. One email he shared with The Times said: “Your behavior is probably going to end up with someone killing you and your wife and your children.”

“It was never my intention to keep necessary medical supplies out of the hands of people who needed them,” he said, crying. “That’s not who I am as a person. And all I’ve been told for the last 48 hours is how much of that person I am.”

Now Mr. Colvin is facing consequences. On Sunday, Amazon and eBay suspended him as a seller, which is how he has made his living for years. The company where he rented a storage unit kicked him out. And the Tennessee attorney general’s office sent him a cease-and-desist letter and opened an investigation.

“We will not tolerate price gouging in this time of exceptional need, and we will take aggressive action to stop it,” Attorney General Herbert H. Slatery III of Tennessee said in a news release.

Tennessee’s price-gouging law prohibits charging “grossly excessive” prices for a variety of items, including food, gas and medical supplies, after the governor declares a state of emergency. The state can fine people up to $1,000 a violation.

The language of the law could benefit Mr. Colvin. Gov. Bill Lee of Tennessee declared a state of emergency on March 12, activating the price-gouging law. The Colvin brothers bought all of the sanitizer and wipes in question before that date, and Mr. Colvin said he did not sell anything after it.

A spokeswoman for the Tennessee attorney general’s office said that even if the Colvin brothers did not buy or sell any of the supplies after March 12, state authorities “will weigh all options under consumer laws.”"

I am Dr. Riciu Andrei, moderator at r/Dermatology, board certified dermatologist from Europe with a strong interest in infectious diseases and rookie web designer - please be kind :). I've been keeping a close eye on the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic since it only numbered a few cases in the Wuhan - Hubei province. 


I remember reporting on a medical website I had back in 2011 about a Dutch Researcher that created a superinfluenza virus as a research project, that was hypothesized to be able to infect millions simply by combining five distinct natural mutations into one H5N1 strain. The times we live in right now aren't pretty much different (except this time the virus is not in a cell culture locked in some research facility). The emergence of SARS-COV-2  that  has spread from animals to humans gave birth to a true pandemic in a matter of months. 

The new  Coronavirus / SARS-CoV-2  demonstrates a strong human-to-human transmission rate coupled with higher mortality rates especially in the elderly group when compared with the regular seasonal influenza. 
The abundance of fake news and claims being spread over the internet as we speak  generate a lot of panic and irrational behavior that obviously does more harm than good. 


I managed to get a team of dedicated medical professionals, data scientists and programmers and we decided to create a resource website namely CoronaWiki  dedicated to the new Coronavirus / SARS-CoV-2 pandemic in order to help as many people as we can gain access to reliable medical information ( documented sources) as well as statistics regarding the COVID-19 disease outbreak. 


Please let us know what other new  features you would like to see on the website. We are really keen on helping as much people as we can gain access to safe and reliable medical information in order to better fight this horrible outbreak.


I am also quite active in the dedicated CoronaVirus Discord server where I try to reply to as much COVID-19 related questions as I can.


Current features:
SARS-CoV-2 real time statistics on:
Number of confirmed cases
Number of recoveries
Number of confirmed deaths
Daily Change of these 3 parameters
Number of cases by country
Statistics for each country for confirmed cases, recoveries, deaths, daily change.
Mortality Rate based on Age, gender and pre-existing medical conditions

Plus if they don’t take it seriously, they’ll be the primary drivers of spreading the disease to those at-risk populations with a mortality rate closer to 13-14%.

Also, we simply don’t know the long term effects of the disease, since it’s caused by an entirely new and unknown virus. Why risk it? Might be nothing, but might cause permanent tissue damage. Critical patients who have recovered have sustained what appears to be permanent lung damage [(see this source for example)](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.businessinsider.com/coronavirus-recovery-damage-lung-function-gasping-air-hong-kong-doctors-2020-3%3famp) Why mess around?

While no one should be blamed for getting ill or be held responsible for the emergence of a new disease. 

China has actively chosen to prioritise CCP over Human Lives, over the whole world.

- Their poor response to their own doctors alert about an emerging viral infection.
- They delayed informing the WHO when they realized the magnitude of the issue.
- Downplaying every aspect of this pandemic to protect their image.
- Their indecisive stance on wet markets.
- Their Propaganda Machine, Trying to point the blame to the US by Saying that COVID19 was manufactured by the USA.

Giving Italy 1000 Ventilators or Helping Iran doesn't erase the above.

Unless they help guide every low and low middle Income countries, build the hospitals and ICUs needed to handle this. 

Supply them with the needed CT machines, mechanical ventilators and testing. 

Then don't get to erase the above.
They don't get to play the hero and they shouldn't convince anyone of this.

When this is over, the vast majority of the world will have been severally impacted. 

Health Systems strained, millions of lives lost and Coronavirus driven recession.

And China will be one of the few countries who comes out of this relatively unscathed.

China shouldn't be allowed to play the hero.

Not while my friend who are a doctor in the high risk group tell me with certainty that she is going to die. 
When I asked if they have mechanical ventilators in the ICU where she works, she said that when people need Oxygen they go to Tunisia. I'm not even sure what she means by ""oxygen"". 

Libya has Zero COVID19 Confirmed Cases and it is certainly not because there aren't any.

The majority here are from High income countries with a functioning health system. And you are all suffering to handle this.

What do you think is going to happen in less off countries ?

Remember, Don't forget and Don't let other forget. 

China is not the Hero, CCP is not the Hero.

And COVID19 is not the USA fault or whoever other country China try to shift the blame to."

Nessel said owners who do not adhere to this will be at risk of losing their liquor license down the road, or possibly even facing closure. ""You may not be getting arrested on St. Patrick's Day but that doesn't mean there won't be significant consequences for you later,"" she said.

2020-03-15,jeneexo,Coronavirus,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/fjdd8n/spring_break_officially_over_in_fort_lauderdale/fkmcc9v/,"Spring break may be in full swing, but now it’s getting a buzz-killing dose of coronavirus reality.
Both Fort Lauderdale and Miami Beach, where spring breakers were expected to flood into town through early April, are closing their beaches in an attempt to contain the spread of COVID-19. Both cities are also ordering bars and restaurants to close by 10 p.m. and cap crowds at 250 people to get a grip on the pandemic.

“We cannot become a petri dish for a very dangerous virus,” Miami Beach Mayor Dan Gelber said Sunday during a joint news conference at Miami Beach City Hall. “Spring break is over. The party is over.”
Fort Lauderdale beach — the sandy section — will be closed from Harbor Drive north to Oakland Park Boulevard. Miami Beach will close the beach from Fifth Street to 15th Street —the uber trendy section known as South Beach. Even its public parking garages will close and an 11 p.m. curfew will be strictly enforced.
Fort Lauderdale’s rules are in effect now through April 12.
Miami Beach officials say their regulations will remain in effect until March 19 and might continue beyond that if necessary.

Violators can risk a $500 fine or 60 days in jail.
“We clearly want to encourage voluntary compliance, but we could arrest or issue notices to appear if necessary,"" Fort Lauderdale City Manager Chris Lagerbloom said.

Gelber and Fort Lauderdale Mayor Dean Trantalis said the two cities worked together on coming up with a plan so that any new rules enforced by one city would not send a crush of spring breakers to the other one.
“We have to do everything we can to minimize crowds and stop further cases of COVID-19,” Trantalis said. “We have to do everything possible to minimize crowds and unfortunately, our beautiful beaches must be part of that plan. I want to be clear that this is not an overreaction, but a way for us to help stop further cases of COVID-19 in our community. We must all do our part to save lives. This includes protecting our residents, visitors and our first responders.”

Gelber had a message for spring breakers who have been descending en masse on South Beach: ""You have a mother, you have a grandmother and maybe a great-grandmother. That virus can be extremely dangerous to them.”
The two mayors announced the measures as the number of new cases in Florida keeps growing and is expected to continue to increase over the next couple months, experts say.

Gov. Ron DeSantis said he applauds Fort Lauderdale and Miami Beach's decision to ""pull the plug"" on large spring break gatherings. 
""Florida is not going to be a place where you are going to be out until 2 a.m. with 500 people in some bar,"" DeSantis said. ""Those gatherings present high risks."" 
Although younger people are not high risk from the disease, they can carry the virus to vulnerable people, he said. 
DeSantis said bars and restaurants are not being ordered to close tonight to protect public health, but he will be reviewing guidance Monday morning that will be issued by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. 

On Friday, Trantalis called a state of emergency in response to the spreading virus, canceling all city events and meetings for the next 30 days, through April 12.
The following events in Fort Lauderdale are postponed:
• All meetings of the commission and city boards, including advisory boards, city committees and City working groups;
• All special magistrate, code enforcement, board of adjustment and nuisance abatement board hearings;
• All homeowners association and civic association meetings held on city property;
• All city events and city-approved events; and
• All city recreational programs, facility rentals, pools and organized sports leagues. Parks facilities and community centers remain open during normal business hours; however, all programming is postponed.
In addition, all organized public gatherings must now be capped at 250 people, Trantalis said.
Exemptions include grocery stores and land or facilities managed by Broward County, the Broward County School District, the North Broward Hospital District, the state or federal government, as well as hospitals and healthcare facilities.
Fort Lauderdale is requiring every public place, including all businesses, restaurants, bars and retail shops to have alcohol-based hand sanitizer at every entrance.
Hollywood Mayor Josh Levy says he got a call from Trantalis on Sunday before the news conference to let him know what was happening.
“Hollywood beach has not experienced the ‘shoulder-to-shoulder’ spring break crowds seen in Fort Lauderdale and Miami Beach,” Levy said. “People have been spread out on our sandy beach. Nonetheless, the county’s situation with COVID-19 is evolving daily, and we will need to do whatever necessary to protect the public from putting themselves at greater risk of contracting the virus.”
Levy declined to say whether Hollywood might consider closing its beach."

So what can the Fed do? For one possible answer we go to Zoltan Pozsar who last week laid out precisely why the coronavirus pandemic (and subsequent oil crisis) would led to a historic run on the dollar (as he so aptly put it **""the supply chains is a payment chain in reverse... and so an abrupt halt in production can quickly lead to missed payments elsewhere""**), and concluded that to offset the dollar scramble, the Fed would need to ""**combine rate cuts with open liquidity lines that include a pledge to use the swap lines, an uncapped repo facility and QE if necessary.**""

So far the Fed has already launched stealth QE, which will likely transform into an official, full-blown QE5 this week when the FOMC meets, and all that's missing are swap lines and an uncapped standing repo facility, both of which cross beyond the purely monetary realm and have political implications. Whether those are also announced today will depend on if the Fed will pursue another intermediate step first, in the form of a Commercial Paper facility, which Bank of America believes will be [unveiled in just a few hours.](https://www.reuters.com/article/health-coronavirus-fed/fed-may-announce-commercial-paper-facilities-sunday-bofa-idUSL1N2B70EB)"

‘There Is Plenty of Food in the Country’

By Michael Corkery, David Yaffe-Bellany, Amelia Nierenberg and Quoctrung Bui
March 15, 2020
Americans have been alarmed by empty grocery shelves, but while food suppliers and retailers say they are struggling with surging demand, they insist the supply chain remains strong.

Grocery stores have been working long hours to restock as a wave of panic buying has spread.

The aisles and aisles of empty store shelves give the appearance that the United States, improbably and alarmingly, is running out of food.

But the nation’s biggest retailers, dairy farmers and meat producers say that isn’t so. The food supply chain, they say, remains intact and has been ramping up to meet the unprecedented stockpiling brought on by the coronavirus pandemic.

Even so, shoppers can most likely expect to see empty shelves intermittently, as the nation’s network of food producers, distributors and retailers are stretched as never before. Industries that are calibrated to supply consumers with just enough of what they need on a given day cannot keep up with a nationwide surge of relentless shopping fueled in large part by fear.

Food suppliers and retailers are now not only struggling to satiate crushing demand for canned soup and oat milk, they are battling a perception that the scary scenes at the grocery store reflect a fundamental breakdown.

“There is food being produced. There is food in warehouses,” said Julie Anna Potts, chief executive of the North American Meat Institute, a trade group for beef, pork and turkey packers and producers. “There is plenty of food in the country.”

“Our stores are getting stocked every day,” Ron Vachris, chief operating officer of Costco, said in an interview on Saturday. “Transportation is functioning, our suppliers are working around the clock and the flow of goods is strong.”

The National Chicken Council said it was not seeing any disruptions in production and noted that there were “ample surplus supplies of chicken in cold storage” — totaling more than 950 million pounds, according to government data.

Still, the fear is palpable. The more empty shelves people see, the more panic-buying ensues, the more food is out of stock.

The panicky buying is testing the food system’s capacity in the near term. Over the past few weeks, sales of rice have increased more than 50 percent, according to data from the research firm Nielsen. Canned meat is up more than 40 percent. And sales of other essentials like beans, pasta, peanut butter and bottled water have also risen substantially, with a sharp spike this month. Kroger told its suppliers that demand had surged 30 percent across all categories in recent days. (For comparison, the company’s sales for all of last year rose about 2 percent.)

Orders for hot dogs at Walmart and Costco increased by as much as 300 percent, meat suppliers say. In response, some hot dog plants have added Saturday and Sunday shifts and have started shipping packages they were storing for Memorial Day cookouts. And hot dog makers say they have a year’s supply of spices like garlic.

Another strategy that is helping ease the strain: Some food supply is being diverted to grocery stores from the restaurants, school cafeterias and college campuses that have closed.

“The food is there. It’s just going into different spots,” said David McInerney, the chief executive of FreshDirect. “Cruise ships are not using up all of the avocados. We have a giant surge of avocados.”

Retailers say the frenzy started about two weeks ago, when customers could not find hand sanitizers and wipes, which were actually in short supply. But that set off a wave of panic buying that spread in recent days to include bread, canned goods, milk and frozen food.

These items are moving through the supply chain, but cannot reach the stores quickly enough so retailers have asked suppliers to produce more.

But even as farmers and slaughterhouses ramp up, producing food takes time. In the poultry industry, it takes 10 days for a chicken egg to incubate and hatch, and then five to six weeks for the bird to grow to maturity. For some chicken suppliers, the process takes even longer, depending on the type of bird.

Across the industry, “you’re talking about 50 days to get to a customer,” said Matthew Wadiak, who runs Cooks Venture, a chicken supplier based in Arkansas and Oklahoma. “Fifty days ago, we didn’t know this was even on the horizon. There was essentially no way to plan for it.”

Mr. Wadiak said some of Cooks Venture’s customers — like the Berkeley Bowl grocery stores in California — had quadrupled their orders in recent days.

“People are very short today. Retailers are short on products,” Mr. Wadiak said. “So we’re helping out where we can, and I know that we’re not meeting the full demand.”

It’s clear that the modern supply chain, for all its efficiency and speed, is not equipped to deal with this kind of surge.

Algorithms, perfected by Amazon, can pinpoint exactly how much inventory a warehouse or particular store must keep on hand during a typical week, right down to the soup can. But no algorithm could predict this extraordinary moment, leading to widespread out-of-stocks of hundreds of household necessities.

“When the shelf is emptied in the course of 24 hours and the safety stock was built intent upon protecting a week or two of demand, you get this tremendous dislocation,” said Mark Cohen, director of retail studies at Columbia Business School.

“The trouble is that the hoarding hasn’t abated. We’re just seeing the very beginning of this kind of behavior,” he added. “The question is: How long will it take for industry to catch up?”

If the illnesses surge, of course, there could be a slowdown in production and distribution, food industry official say. But the extent of any problems could vary across the food chain. Slaughterhouse workers tend to work side by side, possibly making them at a higher risk of spreading the virus. But many dairy farmers operate in sparsely populated rural areas, improving their chances of staying healthy.

Still, industries are starting to make contingency plans in case large numbers of workers producing and delivering food are incapacitated by the virus or roads are shut down as part of the effort to control the pandemic. Representatives for companies that deliver food in refrigerated trucks, for example, are working with local and state officials to make sure they can still make deliveries during quarantines. Some refrigerated warehouse workers could rotate in 14 day shifts to make sure there is backup.

On Friday, officials from every part of the food chain — from fresh produce suppliers to refrigerated warehouses — met outside Washington, D.C., to discuss responses to the pandemic, including ideas for how to bolster parts of the system against disruptions.

For now, the most pressing issue is getting more food on the shelves, while the supply chain is largely unaffected by illness.

“Will there potentially be some hiccups, and might you go to the store and not see everything every time?” said Lowell Randel, vice president for government and legal affairs at the Global Cold Chain Alliance, a trade group representing the refrigerated warehouse and delivery industry. “Yeah. But that’s a short-term disruption and not an indicator that the overall supply chain is not functioning.”

As this cycle continues, however, there is less chance suppliers can catch up with demand, stressing retail workers, who are already vulnerable to contracting the virus because of their constant interaction with the public.

Starting on Monday, the grocery chain Stop & Shop will reduce its hours in stores to give employees more time to restock shelves, but also to allow the workers to get more rest and stay healthy, a spokeswoman said.

Many Walmart stores will also no longer be open all night. The company said it was reducing hours at its stores, starting Sunday, to “help ensure associates are able to stock the products our customers are looking for and to perform cleaning and sanitizing.”

Even if these efforts help slow down the current frenzy, retailers are expecting that the panic buying could come in waves, as the illnesses spike.

“Shopping for food is something that makes you feel in control,” said Blake Waltrip, chief executive of the a2 Milk Company’s United States operations, which has increased production in recent days. “Even when everything else feels totally out of control.”

The common stereotype of East Asians in western culture is that we're all obedient collectivists who would pull a Spock if the government tells us it will improve society. In my experience, that's really inaccurate. Yes, compared to your average American, the average East Asian in their day-to-day life probably has a stronger sense of duty. But that duty doesn't extend far beyond family, and when push comes to shove, it will fall away and reveal pure self-interest. This is actually the basis for most East Asian authoritarian apologia; we aren't naturally cooperative, so a strong government is needed to keep us all in line and working for the common good. The supermarket runs and hoarding have a lot of uncles and aunties in chat groups tsk-tsking about why American governments are too soft.

I think a better explanation for East Asian behavior in crisis situations like the coronavirus pandemic is that we're more willing to see ourselves on the receiving end of calamity, and we're more willing to change behavior in response. *Foreign Policy* editor James Palmer had a [take](https://twitter.com/BeijingPalmer/status/1239025863771009029) about how Americans don't believe bad things can happen to them in group catastrophes, and that matches my experience. Americans think more about inconvenience, while East Asians think more about what's at stake. The East Asian reaction to the pandemic that I've seen in my Bay Area community -- social distancing that well preceded the Americans that have been doing it in the past few days -- matches that. It's more about trying to keep ourselves and our families safe than it is about ""everyone in society doing their part."""

I have a dental appointment in 2 weeks for treating my three cavities. I’ve been self-isolating for days (healthy) and avoided almost all social contact. Location: NYC.

Given the worsening situation and the fact dentists are one of the most high risk occupations during this outbreak, should I put off my appointment and risk having very bad teeth to be fixed afterwards? This outbreak could last months. The appointment is also very hard to get, I reserved mine one month ago.

1. Ignorance (""ha ha, stupid China and their virus panic again!"")

2. First infected (""meh, it's just one guy, who cares"")

3. Small clusters of patients

4. Large clusters all around the country - people start to worry

5. Government panics and shuts down the country 

6. Two weeks go by, the number of new infections starts trending towards zero

7. Quarantine is slowly relaxed (China is here)

8. Things go back to normal, with incomers being forced to take a COVID-19 test at the airport (China will reach that stage soon)

Meanwhile ""flatten the curve"" means that we'll spend many months waiting for everyone to get infected and not being able to go back to normal life. Whoever came up with that idea had good intentions, but didn't bother running the actual numbers."

Germany is to impose controls on its borders with France, Switzerland, Austria, Denmark and Luxembourg as of Monday morning, while Portugal will clamp down on its frontier with Spain.

Austria is banning gatherings of more than five people from Monday, and the Republic of Ireland is asking pubs to shut until 29 March.

I’m in California. I’m hesitant to post about this but I have no one else to talk to.

First, my rational and logical side, and the only one I’ll ever act on and speak about publically says that the chief citrus fruit is a massive fucking failure, schools should close, nonessential businesses should close, we should pull a China as long for as many months or years as it takes. 

However, second and personally I’m four months into a new job that has been the best thing in my working life to date. Prior to this job I worked upwards of 60 hours a week for a boss that was never pleased, commuted 3 hours a day or more to job sites, was repeatedly criticized for taking time off for my mother’s cancer treatments and was eventually put on a firing plan before I just up and quit. I had been getting used to the idea of dating, socializing, going out, etc after 3 years of working and making looking for new work my only interest. So the selfish part of me is feeling cabin fever and California isn’t locked down yet. 

Thirdly, when I feel cabin fever of any sort I immediately feel like I can’t express it since it’s an incredibly entitled and selfish feeling. People might lose their jobs and/or die or have loved ones die, so any amount of cabin fever for me personally should be immediately surpressed. My favorite small businesses probably will go under and all I have to deal with is some insignificant feelings.

Also, I might have told one of my former friends all about this, but the coronavirus has exposed him as an ardent trump supporter so I’m on my way to cutting him out. My other close friends are in relationships and I suspect it’s  actually a good thing for them to have quarantine and close time. 

Let the downvotes begin as I go about stress repairing clothes and houseware."

More important data would be the status of those patients. Can you create/deploy a legitimate, standard identification system of mild/moderate/severe cases?
We had a local headline of “4 patients test positive for Coronavirus, treated and released”. So, mild.

I was trying to give the most conservative estimate possible. Most experts put it between 40 and 70 percent of the world getting coronavirus over the next year. So that's likely closer to 150 million people in the U.S.

>Between 160 million and 214 million people in the United States could be infected over the course of the epidemic, according to a projection that encompasses the range of the four scenarios. That could last months or even over a year, with infections concentrated in shorter periods, staggered across time in different communities, experts said. As many as 200,000 to 1.7 million people could die.

2020-03-15,John_Charles_Fremont,neoliberal,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/neoliberal/comments/fixgbg/discussion_thread/fklx4im/,"From Berkeley economist and AER co-editor Pierre-Olivier Gourinchas ([see: flattening the pandemic and recession curves](https://sites.google.com/view/pgourinchas/home)):

> In a perfect world, people would self-isolate until infection rates decline sufficiently and public
health authorities give the all-clear. At that point, the economic engines would re-start: workers
would go back to work, factories would turn back on, ships would load their cargo and planes
would take off.

> The first thing to note is that, even in that perfect world, the economic damage would be
considerable. To see this, assume that, relative to a baseline, containment measures reduce
economic activity by 50% for one month and 25% for another month, after which the economy
returns to the baseline. Such a sharp but short-lived decline in activity does not seem
unreasonable if one thinks that a majority of the labor force is currently shuttered at home in
places like Italy or China. In fact, we could anticipate a much more drawn out process.
**Yet, that scenario would still deliver a massive blow to headline GDP numbers, with a decline in
annual output growth of the order of 6.5% relative to the previous year.** 

> Extend the 25% shutdown for just another month and the decline in annual output growth (relative to the previous year) reaches almost 10%! As a number of economists have pointed out, most of this lost GDP will not be coming back, so it is reasonable to assume a return to the baseline, rather than a later surge in activity - although one could expect a post-recession surge in spending on postponed durable goods purchases. 

> As a point of comparison, the decline in output growth in the U.S. during the 2008-09 Great Recession was around 4.5%. **We are about to witness a downturn that could dwarf the Great
Recession.**

> Why are the numbers so much larger now? The short answer is that - **even at the peak of the
financial crisis when the U.S. economy was shedding jobs at the rate of 800 thousand workers
per month, the vast majority of people were still employed and working.** The unemployment
rate in the U.S. peaked at ""just"" 10%. By contrast, the coronavirus is creating a situation where -
for a brief amount of time - 50% or more of people may not be able to work. The impact on
economic activity is comparatively that much larger.

> **Yet, this is the optimistic scenario. We do not live in the perfect world described above.**
Instead, a downturn of this magnitude will send shock waves through the economy that could
do serious damage. Improperly managed, the economic cost could be much larger and longer
lasting."

""Large events and mass gatherings can contribute to the spread of COVID-19 in the United States via travelers who attend these events and introduce the virus to new communities. Examples of large events and mass gatherings include conferences, festivals, parades, concerts, sporting events, weddings, and other types of assemblies. These events can be planned not only by organizations and communities but also by individuals.

Therefore, CDC, in accordance with its guidance for large events and mass gatherings, recommends that for the next 8 weeks, organizers (whether groups or individuals) cancel or postpone in-person events that consist of 50 people or more throughout the United States.

Events of any size should only be continued if they can be carried out with adherence to guidelines for protecting vulnerable populations, hand hygiene, and social distancing.  When feasible, organizers could modify events to be virtual.

This recommendation does not apply to the day to day operation of organizations such as schools, institutes of higher learning, or businesses. This recommendation is made in an attempt to reduce introduction of the virus into new communities and to slow the spread of infection in communities already affected by the virus.  This recommendation is not intended to supersede the advice of local public health officials.""

I’m over here watching the Nickelodeon ninja turtles channel with my kids. It’s way overhyped. I tested positive for Influenza B and was diagnosed with bronchitis a month or two ago and it was one of the most excruciating illnesses (aside from viral meningitis) that I’ve ever had. The doctors sent me home giving zero f**cks, gave me a breathing treatment, some prednisone (which I had a severe reaction to mentally) and some cough suppressants and lectured me about not getting a flu shot.(Despite the CDC always talking about how millions of people die from the flu each year) 

I couldn’t breath without my lungs burning and my heartbeat pounding through my chest. I couldn’t sleep, even though my normal Xanax prescription knocks me out. (And that was before the prednisone that gave me insomnia and hallucinations) my right arm and wrists weren’t functioning properly. My kids caught a milder version and they said their feet and wrists felt like elephants (I’m assuming really heavy like my arm and wrists did) 

On one hand they’re saying it’s mostly mild symptoms. On the other hand they’re saying in other countries, the bodies are piling up.

To not hold a commencement ceremony sort of diminishes that feeling of accomplishment and makes it feel cheap when you're just given a piece of paper and a letter or email that says congratulations.

I won't deny that there are some people who might not care too much about commencement ceremonies whether that be students who straight up think that it's worthless (such as yourself, no offense) or students who may be working full time or have kids. I'm not saying this is a bad thing at all and you are entitled to have your own opinion, but just keep in mind that there are some students that wish it didn't get cancelled since it is still a special day after working their ass off.

In regards to the coronavirus, I can't deny the importance of staying safe and clean out there. There's not much to counter there since it's better safe than sorry to not travel around often if you don't need to. The matter of the fact is we're not really sure how much worse it can get by the time graduation day comes around, but the media somehow contrives the numbers and exaggerates just how bad it is where people are in a state of panic.

So overall, I agree that it may not be a bad idea to call off or delay the commencement ceremony if coronavirus gets much worse than before (note that this is hypothetical since it can be an either or situation at this point in time), but also that some students want to be able to have a few days just to celebrate their college graduation in a special way and not just get sent home a diploma along with a letter/email."

I have crippling anxiety, especially when it comes to health issues. I’ve lost countless people to unexpected health issues, and it has destroyed me in unusual ways. 2 weeks ago today, in Florence, I got engaged to my best friend of 5 years. That night, he came down with a flu and I was PETRIFIED. I haven’t had a full blown panic attack in 4 years until that night, and every night since, I’ve had at least 1 per day. We came home and we were tested for coronavirus and luckily we were tested negative. I am still nervous because we have to go to work still and there are chances we could still catch coronavirus, and the main thing I worry about is losing him. However, yesterday I realised that I’m worrying about something that might never happen, and I’m worrying to the extent where I am in a separate room shaking on the floor in tears over losing him, when he is in the other room watching a movie on the couch with a quilt. Why am I not in there with him??? What was I doing!? I know it’s not possible to just simply turn off anxiety, but in that moment I thought all I can do is spend time with him now. If we do get poorly, I’m putting myself through the trauma twice. I may as well spend time with him. So I put my phone down, I cuddled on the couch and today is my first day in 2 weeks panic attack free.

The move follows weekend talks in which the central banks co-ordinated the moves for fear that global liquidity would disappear as confusion reins on the extent of the virus.

Traders say in Australia late Friday demand for Australian government bonds disappeared.


The federal government had committed to spending 2 per cent of the country’s GDP to boost the economy forcing the budget into deficit.

Coronavirus is very widely known. You would have to go to a deadzone somewhere in the planet just to hope to bump into someone who's never heard of COVID-19 by now. So if you have potentially thousands of people that could visit a grocery store at a moment's notice, they're going to think to pick up something to help wait out the pandemic. The vast majority of people aren't wheeling carts full of toilet paper to the checkout. In fact, stores are straight up enforcing ""limit X per customer"" for items such as TP, bread, pasta, soap, and whatever is in high demand.

Any country that has introduced it in response to c19 has seen an immediate leveling off of total infections where before there was a doubling every two days. If Hubei had locked down on 1/22 instead of 1/23 it would have prevented twenty thousand infections - at the death rate of ~4% that's found in countries with overwhelmed medical systems, that's eight hundred deaths because of ONE DAY of inaction.

2020-03-15,RatinSweet,Coronavirus,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/fj1m3e/daily_discussion_post_march_15_questions_images/fkm3zej/,"Given Reddit's doom and gloom outlook on this, can I ask someone to point out some of the flaws in what I researched and saw today?

So we know South Korea's first case came 1 day before the US's. They've done tens of thousands of tests per day. The vast, vast majority (\~98%) come back negative, and they only tested about 0.6-0.7% of the population -- you have to remember that 10,000 a day for a country with millions of people is a small percentile.

South Korea reports roughly 80 deaths.

The US reports around 60-70 deaths. We have far fewer cases than South Korea, for obvious reasons. Reddit seems to claim that the US's numbers should be 10 to 100 fold the official number of 3,500 today. That means we should have somewhere in the range of 35,000 to 350,000 real cases. We can draw two conclusions...

(1) Suppose that's true. We have 60 odd deaths, and right now, a couple hundred in the hospitals. Suppose everyone in the hospital dies. If we have 35,000 cases, our mortality rate is in the range of 0.5%. If we have 350,000, the mortality rate is 0.05%. The actual case mortality rate is around that of the flu, possibly lower.

(2) We go by the WHO case mortality rate of 3.4%. Now, I understand that not everyone who has the disease right now will recover, and that there may be many more deaths. But the percentage of the critically ill is very low (10% globally) and among those that are critically ill, half survive. If we go by mortality rate, there should be about 5,000 to 10,000 total cases, not too far off that of Korea.

Basically, either (1) millions of people will get it, many hardly even batting an eye to the symptoms leading to CFR of something similar to the flu, or (2) the number of cases is NOT 10 or 100 fold what is reported, and the death percentage is accurate in that this disease is quite a bit more deadly than the flu.

I know you can hide cases really easily. But hiding deaths is a totally different ball game. Also, we are NOT putting people who died of COVID19 as a flu related death, as anyone suspected of dying of flu-like symptoms are tested for coronavirus as well prior to death. Also, the flu deaths is not too different this year than previous years.

I'm not trying to attack anybody, but please, can I get exactly where I went wrong with my logic?"
2020-03-15,redlollipop,nycCoronavirus,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/nycCoronavirus/comments/fjbg1l/new_york_bars_restaurants_and_gyms_should/fkm3i56/,"""New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo on Sunday called on nonessential businesses such as bars, restaurants and gyms to close voluntarily as the new coronavirus continues to spread.

New York now has 729 confirmed cases of the virus, which is more than any other state, Mr. Cuomo said at a press conference. Almost half of New York’s cases were in New York City. Mayor Bill de Blasio said the city has recorded five virus-related deaths.

Mr. Cuomo’s said that if businesses didn’t heed his request and if the spread of the virus doesn’t slow, he would tighten recent mandatory guidelines that ban most gatherings of more than 500 people and limit businesses to half their legal occupancy.

“We have never fought a virus like this with this potential consequence,” Mr. Cuomo said.

Mr. Cuomo said that in the coming weeks he expects the state’s hospital system to be overwhelmed. He said the state had only 3,000 intensive care beds with the ventilators necessary to help people infected with the virus. Already, 80% of those beds are occupied by patients with other health issues, he said.

Public-health experts say that the best way to slow the spread of the virus is for people to socially distance themselves from others. Still, many New York City bars and restaurants were busy over the weekend.

New York City elected officials on Sunday called on the mayor to close such businesses.

Councilman Brad Lander, a Brooklyn Democrat, said in an interview that collective action would be more effective at slowing the spread of the virus than the current reliance on people’s personal actions. “It’s got to be done at a mass scale,” Mr. Lander said.

He added that some services, such as food delivery, might need to be omitted from any actions because they provide a vital service for some people who cannot cook for themselves.

Mr. de Blasio said Sunday evening that the city would crack down on businesses not abiding by the rule limiting businesses to half their legal occupancy. “In terms of the future of bars and restaurants, that is an ongoing discussion that will continue this evening,” he said.

Meanwhile, the Metropolitan Transportation Authority announced Sunday that one of its workers on the Long Island Rail Road had tested positive for the virus. Officials said the worker’s role didn’t involve interaction with customers."""

The 58 year old was living in a facility for individuals with developmental disabilities.

I looked up Touro Hospital and came across a phone interview with a patient not identified but in his ""mid 50s"" from March 11--not sure if it could be the 53 yr old, but also not sure how many are at this facility at this point because originally it wasn't as many, but I'm not sure how many are hospitalized now. In his interview he said he checked in the prior Monday with flu-like conditions, but when he tested negative (and informed staff he drove a bus in which he had contact with international passengers) they tested him for COVID-19, and it was positive. He was put into a quarantined room, but he said he felt much better and was just waiting to go home. The staff said they wanted to monitor him for a few more days due to him having a few underlying health conditions. He told the reporter he wanted to stress importance to taxi/lyft/bus/uber drivers the importance of getting tested if they have symptoms since they have contact with tourists. If it *was* the same guy, it's really scary, because he was feeling better and just waiting to go home.

&#x200B;

Governor Charlie Baker announced Sunday that all bars and restaurants in Massachusetts would be [shut down to on-premise consumption](https://www.mass.gov/doc/march-15-2020-large-gatherings-25-and-restaurants-order) starting Tuesday until April 6, and banned gatherings larger than 25 people, in an effort to stem the coronavirus outbreak in the state. He also ordered [a three-week suspension](https://www.mass.gov/doc/march-15-2020-school-closure-order) of all public and private schools, effective Tuesday until April 6. (Baker originally said at a press conference that restaurants would be closed through April 17 and schools through April 7, but a statement from his office said otherwise.)

There is also now evidence of community spread in seven Massachusetts counties, including Berkshire, Essex, Hampden, Norfolk, Middlesex, Suffolk, and Worcester, said Monica Bharel, commissioner of the state’s Department of Public Health.

“The facts on the ground have changed,” Baker said. “Now that we have evidence based on the testing results that we have community transmission in seven counties in Massachusetts, I think at this point in time it’s particularly appropriate we not only move on the school closures, but also that we get a lot more aggressive around other places and spaces that people gather.”

Baker said he was amending earlier guidance banning gatherings of 250 people or more to 25, including all community, civic, public, leisure, and faith-based events, as well as sports games with spectators, concerts, and conventions. It also covers fitness centers, private clubs, and theaters.

Retail stores can stay open as long as they have 25 people or less in them, Baker said.

Baker said that bars and restaurants can continue to offer food for takeout or delivery, and noted that the order does not apply to grocery stores or pharmacies. This means people cannot sit inside restaurants, Baker said.

“If we take decisive steps now and everyone plays their part by following the best medical guidance, we can slow down the spread,” Baker said at a press conference Sunday night, adding that the coronavirus is “incredibly contagious. It is more contagious than the seasonal flu.”

Baker also implored people, especially those of a younger age, to adhere to social distancing practices, saying they could unwittingly infect older people they come in contact with.

“It’s important that young people appreciate and understand that in respect to this, it’s not just about them,” he said.

Earlier on Sunday, Massachusetts officials reported [26 new cases of coronavirus](https://www.mass.gov/files/documents/2020/03/15/covid-19-case-report-3-15-2020.pdf), bringing the total in the state to 164, up from 138 the day before. That includes 45 confirmed cases, and 119 presumptive positive tests, according to state numbers.

State health officials also said that 799 individuals have been tested for coronavirus as of Sunday morning, according to a statement, less than two days after local leaders said Massachusetts would be able to increase the pace of testing.

The state’s Department of Public Health said the new CDC protocols allows clinicians to only submit one nasal swab, rather than a requirement to submit a nasal swab and throat swab as part of testing."

My doctor treated me for flu as yours did. Follow her directions carefully. Take your Tamiflu, sleep, drink plenty of fluids and monitor your symptoms. 

Yes, I had the flu twice this year. Tamiflu worked well because I began taking the drug within 36 hours of the start of my symptoms. It’s effectiveness was a sign that I indeed had the flu—not COVID-19. I remained ill for the rest of the week but my symptoms eased considerably.

Keep a diary of your symptoms. Pay especially close attention to your respiratory symptoms. Log your temperature. If your respiratory symptoms worsen call your doctor immediately. If you need help right away head to the emergency room.

From what I've seen -- and I've been following this topic pretty intensely -- there is still a lot of confusion about this amongst the medical community.

What is undeniable, however, is that several people in several different countries who were originally infected and later recovered, all tested negative for the virus at some point and at a later date tested positive yet again (sometimes days, sometimes weeks later).

WASHINGTON — The latest from the Sunday night Democratic debate between former Vice President Joe Biden and Sen. Bernie Sanders (all times local):

8:30 p.m.

The first clash of the head-to-head debate between Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders is coming in the form of a dust-up over whether Sanders' signature health care plan is the best way to respond to the coronavirus.

After Sanders said the Trump administration's response to the outbreak laid bare the weaknesses of the nation's current health care system, Biden pointed out that Italy - where the virus has essentially quarantined the country, has a government-run health care system that hasn't alleviated the problem.

“With all due respect to 'Medicare for All,' you have a single-payer system in Italy,” Biden said. ""It doesn't work there.""

Sanders responded by noting that experts say “one of the reasons that we are unprepared ... is that we don't have a system.”

Sanders argues his single-payer health care system would provide free treatment for those diagnosed with COVID-19. Biden says he would authorize government funds to cover treatment.

8:20 p.m.

Bernie Sanders says President Donald Trump needs to stop ""blabbering"" with inaccurate information about the novel coronavirus.

Sanders and Joe Biden are addressing how they'd respond to the new virus during the first questions in Sunday's Democratic presidential debate. It's the first debate between just the two Democratic presidential contenders and the first since the U.S. dramatically increased its response to the virus.

Sanders says if he were president he would make sure no one has to pay for coronavirus testing or treatment. Biden later said he also believes no one should have to pay.

Biden says every state needs to have at least 10 drive-thru testing locations and that the Defense Department and the Federal Emergency Management Agency need to be making plans to set up additional hospital beds.

___

8 p.m.

Former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders have taken the stage for the first one-on-one debate of the Democratic primary.

The leading Democratic candidates are facing off Sunday night in Washington in the 11th debate of the primary season. The event was moved from Arizona, which votes Tuesday, because of concerns over the growing coronavirus pandemic, and is being held without an audience.

Biden also steps on the stage as the front-runner in a race dramatically different from the party's last debate less than three weeks ago, following cascading wins that started with his resounding victory in the South Carolina primary. Other moderates departed the race, with several consolidating around Biden and united by a desire to block Sanders.

The fast-moving coronavirus has largely grounded the candidates, leading them to cancel rallies even as several big states prepare to vote on Tuesday. They greeted each other with an elbow bump."

We're in close proximity to the public. That's just how it is. Whether flu season, coronavirus, holiday shopping, higher volume locations, etc. We're always exposed to diseases, viruses and bacteria, more so than other professions.

Proper frequent handwashing, not touching our face, not coughing or sneezing in the air and washing hands immediately after coughing / sneezing in our hands WITHOUT touching anything on our way to sink. After washing our hands, don't turn off the water or open the door without using a towel. Otherwise, you're just touching an extremely dirty surface immediately after cleaning your hands.

These are things we all should've been practicing BEFORE our introduction to coronavirus. Perhaps we wouldn't have had up to 50,000 deaths caused by the flu since October if we all had been more mindful.

Trader Joe's is a great company to work for. If you, for whatever reason are uncomfortable at work, Trader Joe's will be very accommodating to your needs. They don't want you to be uncomfortable.

When they signed Clint it was game over and I knew that was my sign despite being a part-time supporter. You like who you like is my point. Living in Mississippi for my childhood, everyone expects you to be a Falcons or a Titans fan for football and there's a lot of bandwagoning by proxy sort of going on. I used to see all of these Titans jerseys when they almost beat the Rams in the Superbowl... Since then, nothing. It's almost as bad as supporting local then seeing people who never used to care or were a fan of another team come along and pretend they were a supporter since day one. But anyways.

The evolving worldwide situation related to COVID-19 will naturally be a source of concern for employees and their families. ISED employees can be confident that their well-being will remain a top priority of the department. As part of our efforts to support our employees, we will continue to keep everyone informed on a regular basis.
If you have team members who do not have mobile devices, you are encouraged to reach out to them via other means over the weekend to ensure they are aware of the updated information below.

**Flexible Work Arrangements**  
Employees should be prepared to work remotely on short notice. 
ISED employees must bring their laptops and tablets home at the end of each workday. To reduce the strain on our networks, please connect remotely only as required. Employees should work offline as much as possible, only connecting as needed to access emails, documents or specific services. 
The Treasury Board of Canada Secretariat has been working with Shared Services Canada and departmental chief information officers to maximize Internet bandwidth to support remote work and prioritize network access tied to critical operations. 
In the interim, please help us ensure ISED can prioritize critical services by:  
•	disconnecting from GCSRA when you are working on documents or reports;  
•	using your work cellphone to read and reply to emails; and  
•	refraining from using non-essential services such as streaming services.  
This allows us to make the best use of our network and avoid reaching bandwidth capacity, which could result in broad network performance issues for everyone.  
It is also important to be vigilant of increased phishing attempts, as attackers see this as a time when organizations are vulnerable. Be on the lookout for suspicious emails, especially if they contain suspicious files or links, as well as suspicious phone calls or text messages on your work phone. 
If you require access or are having difficulty connecting, please contact the IT Service Desk by email or by calling 613-946-5555 or 1-866-929-3375 (toll free). 

**Travel**  
The Prime Minister has advised Canadians to avoid international travel. In light of this advice, employees must declare their personal travel to their manager and take into consideration public health travel advisories as per the active travel health notices.
For any questions regarding business travel, please speak with your manager.

**Leave**  
Employees who are required by public health officials to self-isolate: If they are in good health and able to work, employees will be asked to discuss with their managers the option to telework. If telework is not possible, employees will be granted “other leave with pay” (699 code) as per their collective agreements. Individual cases may have to be examined on their own merits (i.e. if an employee willingly chose to travel to affected areas contrary to public health advice). 
Employees whose children cannot attend school or daycare due to a closure or because of attendance restrictions in place in relation to the COVID-19 situation: Employees will attempt to make alternative care arrangements. If that is not possible, they will discuss with their managers the option to telework. If telework is not possible, the employees will be granted “other leave with pay” (699 code). This guidance for disruption of school and daycare operations related to COVID-19 will apply for the duration of the disruption in the respective jurisdictions but will be reassessed on April 10, 2020. 
Leave provisions contained in the FAQ document available on the GCIntranet webpage will be amended to reflect these changes.
If ISED managers have questions regarding these directives, they are asked to contact the ISED COVID-19 Tiger Team.

**Mental Health**  
The Office of the Chief Human Resources Officer is currently preparing information for employees to outline key mental health resources and tips. 
Employees are encouraged to seek help, as needed, by contacting the 24-7 Employee Assistance Program (EAP), contacting the departmental EAP coordinator, accessing care through the Public Service Health Care Plan (PSHCP) or using the nationwide Specialized Organizational Services (SOS). 

**Facilities**  
If you believe that you are confronted with a possible or confirmed COVID-19 case, please immediately contact Public Services and Procurement Canada’s (PSPC) National Service Call Centre. PSPC or its service provider will work with Corporate Facilities partners, landlords (if applicable) and the occupants to design and implement an appropriate disinfection plan. 
Finally, please continue to stay up to date through the Canada.ca/Coronavirus and ISED COVID-19 intranet page. Corporate Communications will continue to communicate on a regular basis, so managers are encouraged to be in regular contact with their employees to ensure all employees are kept up to date. 
To report any cases or situations related to COVID-19 or to get additional information, please contact the ISED COVID-19 Tiger Team."

WinnersJoe Biden: “Bernie Sanders right now needs a fundamental change in the race to chip away at Biden’s delegate lead, and it’s not clear anything transpired Sunday night that might provide that. He repeatedly pointed to votes Biden had taken as a senator and bills he had worked on that don’t fit as well with today’s Democratic Party, and Biden got testy at times. But Biden was largely focused, and he repeatedly brought things back to what was clearly a point of emphasis for him: Saying he had worked to get things done while Sanders lobbed bombs from the sidelines. “I did that, while you were watching,” he said at one point about a renewable energy bill. He repeated his talking point that “people want results, not a revolution,” and then expanded on it. “We have problems we have to solve now,” he said. “What’s the revolution going to do? Disrupt everything.”Biden wasn’t sterling at the debate, but he seldom is, and the lack of an audience seemed to work against Sanders, who often thrives on them. Sanders also needed more from this than Biden did. Biden drove home the point that he would be a steady, pragmatic hand at an uncertain time. And the crisis we find ourselves in right now fits nicely with that message.”


Kamala Harris, Amy Klobuchar and other would-be female VPs: “Biden made some real news, which is somewhat rare in these debates: “I will pick a woman to be my vice president,” he said. Sanders was asked whether he would do the same thing, and had to be pressed by a moderator before he said, “In all likelihood, I will.” This may not be terribly surprising. With two white men remaining in the Democratic field, it’s been likely the nominee’s running mate would either be a woman or a racial minority. But it did solidify that people like Kamala Harris, Amy Klobuchar, Stacey Abrams, Elizabeth Warren — and others — are now the ones competing for a shot at the nation’s No. 2 job. On the flip side, people like Cory Booker and Julián Castro will apparently not be in the mix.”“Strategically for Biden, it was a wise move. He was coming off a half-hour of pretty tough attacks on his voting record on issues like the economy and abortion, and it successfully changed the subject. (Biden, for what it’s worth, has also said he would name an African American female to the Supreme Court.)Audience-free debates: This was the first debate in decades without an audience. Let’s hope it’s not the last. The audience marred a recent debate by clearly favoring certain candidates (Mike Bloomberg) over others (Sanders). And there is really no reason for audience reactions to color who has good answers and who doesn’t. It encourages playing to the crowd rather than having substantive debates. Sunday night’s debate may not have been the best we’ve ever seen, but it was certainly better thanks to the lack of cheering and booing.”
LosersSanders on coronavirus: “One of the things that plagued Sanders during his 2016 campaign was his tendency to fall back on his economic message as kind of a crutch, even when asked about things like race relations. And that struck again Sunday night. Repeatedly when asked about coronavirus, Sanders struggled to come up with immediate solutions and reverted to talking about his Medicare-for-all proposal. When he was asked about how he would hold China accountable for allegedly covering up the spread of coronavirus, he pivoted to attacking President Trump. About the best he could muster was talking about how we needed to bring world leaders together to respond. Oh, and he incorrectly referred to coronavirus as “Ebola.”


“It got to the point where Biden repeatedly pointed to the lack of answers from Sanders. After Sanders brought up one of his pet issues — income inequality — Biden shot back that coronavirus “has nothing to do with the legitimate concern about income inequality in our country.” He added, “I don’t disagree with that. You’re asking about the crisis. … It’s not going to be solved by a change in tax policy. It’s not going to be solved with a change in health care.”Biden’s Medicare-for-all attack: While Biden is ahead in the delegate race and is on pace for the nomination, it was he who started the jousting Sunday night. While talking about coronavirus, Biden launched into talking about how Medicare-for-all wouldn’t solve the problem. “With all due respect to Medicare-for-all, you have a single-payer system in Italy,” Biden said. “It doesn’t work there. It has nothing to do with Medicare-for-all.”[Coronavirus presents real-world test for state-run, single-payer health systems]Biden repeatedly made the case that such situations could be addressed with immediate action rather than an overhaul of the health-care system. But then Sanders hit back by saying, “The trick is, do we have the guts to take on the health care industry, some of which are funding the vice president’s campaign?” Biden then pulled out of the joust, saying, “I don’t want to get into a back in forth in term of our politics here.” But he started it! And then he didn’t finish it.It didn’t seem Sanders was nearly as anxious to mix it up Sunday night. You kind of wonder if Biden hadn’t gone at him right away if they might have had a more civil debate — which would have been good for Biden. After Sanders began attacking Biden’s record hard on entitlements and bailouts, Biden appeared taken aback. When asked about how he would reach out to Sanders supporters, Biden said, “He’s making it hard for me right now. I was trying to give him credit for things."""

BOSTON — First came the tickle in the throat. Then, a hacking cough. Then, a shortness of breath she had never experienced before. Hillary King, a 32-year-old consultant in Boston who lives down the street from a hotel where dozens of Biogen executives contracted the new coronavirus, decided that she had better get tested.

But getting tested is far easier said than done, even as testing slowly ramps up nationwide. Five days after President Trump announced that anyone who wants a test can get a test, Ms. King’s experience shows how difficult it can be in the United States to find out if you have the coronavirus.

Many who fear they have the virus have faced one roadblock after another as they try to get tested, according to interviews with dozens of people across the country.

Some have been rejected because they had no symptoms, even though they had been in proximity to someone who tested positive. Others were told no because they had not traveled to a hot spot abroad, even though they had fevers and hacking coughs and lived in cities with growing outbreaks. Still others were told a bitter truth: There simply were not enough tests to go around."

""By the way, we have been in very good talks with this company for two weeks now."" The news today is therefore also a bit delayed. In addition, the company provides financial support to research teams in Germany and Europe as well as support for the rapid approval of potential vaccines.

Both Fort Lauderdale and Miami Beach, where spring breakers were expected to flood into town through early April, are closing their beaches in an attempt to contain the spread of COVID-19. Both cities are also ordering bars and restaurants to close by 10 p.m. and cap crowds at 250 people to get a grip on the pandemic.

“We cannot become a petri dish for a very dangerous virus,” Miami Beach Mayor Dan Gelber said Sunday during a joint news conference at Miami Beach City Hall. “Spring break is over. The party is over.”

Fort Lauderdale beach — the sandy section — will be closed from Harbor Drive north to Oakland Park Boulevard. Miami Beach will close the beach from Fifth Street to 15th Street —the uber trendy section known as South Beach. Even its public parking garages will close and an 11 p.m. curfew will be strictly enforced.

Fort Lauderdale’s rules are in effect now through April 12.

Miami Beach officials say their regulations will remain in effect until March 19 and might continue beyond that if necessary.

Violators can risk a $500 fine or 60 days in jail.

“We clearly want to encourage voluntary compliance, but we could arrest or issue notices to appear if necessary,"" Fort Lauderdale City Manager Chris Lagerbloom said.

Gelber and Fort Lauderdale Mayor Dean Trantalis said the two cities worked together on coming up with a plan so that any new rules enforced by one city would not send a crush of spring breakers to the other one.

“We have to do everything we can to minimize crowds and stop further cases of COVID-19,” Trantalis said. “We have to do everything possible to minimize crowds and unfortunately, our beautiful beaches must be part of that plan. I want to be clear that this is not an overreaction, but a way for us to help stop further cases of COVID-19 in our community. We must all do our part to save lives. This includes protecting our residents, visitors and our first responders.”

Gelber had a message for spring breakers who have been descending en masse on South Beach: ""You have a mother, you have a grandmother and maybe a great-grandmother. That virus can be extremely dangerous to them.”

The two mayors announced the measures as the number of new cases in Florida keeps growing and is expected to continue to increase over the next couple months, experts say.

Gov. Ron DeSantis said he applauds Fort Lauderdale and Miami Beach's decision to ""pull the plug"" on large spring break gatherings. 

""Florida is not going to be a place where you are going to be out until 2 a.m. with 500 people in some bar,"" DeSantis said. ""Those gatherings present high risks."" 

Although younger people are not high risk from the disease, they can carry the virus to vulnerable people, he said. 

DeSantis said bars and restaurants are not being ordered to close tonight to protect public health, but he will be reviewing guidance Monday morning that will be issued by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. 

On Friday, Trantalis called a state of emergency in response to the spreading virus, canceling all city events and meetings for the next 30 days, through April 12.

The following events in Fort Lauderdale are postponed:

• All meetings of the commission and city boards, including advisory boards, city committees and City working groups;

• All special magistrate, code enforcement, board of adjustment and nuisance abatement board hearings;

• All homeowners association and civic association meetings held on city property;

• All city events and city-approved events; and

• All city recreational programs, facility rentals, pools and organized sports leagues. Parks facilities and community centers remain open during normal business hours; however, all programming is postponed.

In addition, all organized public gatherings must now be capped at 250 people, Trantalis said.

Exemptions include grocery stores and land or facilities managed by Broward County, the Broward County School District, the North Broward Hospital District, the state or federal government, as well as hospitals and healthcare facilities.

Fort Lauderdale is requiring every public place, including all businesses, restaurants, bars and retail shops to have alcohol-based hand sanitizer at every entrance.

Hollywood Mayor Josh Levy says he got a call from Trantalis on Sunday before the news conference to let him know what was happening.

“Hollywood beach has not experienced the ‘shoulder-to-shoulder’ spring break crowds seen in Fort Lauderdale and Miami Beach,” Levy said. “People have been spread out on our sandy beach. Nonetheless, the county’s situation with COVID-19 is evolving daily, and we will need to do whatever necessary to protect the public from putting themselves at greater risk of contracting the virus.”

Levy declined to say whether Hollywood might consider closing its beach."

Recording methods paragraph

First article I could find that talks about counting discrepancies, but I remember hearing this exact same thing in our tv programs very early on while people were wondering why Germany had very few cases, turns out they simply have a different definition of coronavirus ""case"". Here if you die in the hospital and you test positive you are added to the coronavirus deaths, while it's possible you died ""with"" coronavirus while having other conditions, not died exactly because of coronavirus, or at least it's not possible to say it's 100% coronavirus' fault. All these patients are corona deaths here, somewhere else it isn't like that, or they aren't even tested post-mortem (here they are) so you'll never know if they had coronavirus or not when they died, if they hadn't been tested before. Mortality rates that differ so much aren't due to different quality of healthcare, especially when talking about something that basically has no effective treatment. It's due to a combination of factors that range from differences in reporting criteria to political and economical decisions. It's possible those reporting criteria were made with the latter two in mind in the first place, hence the huge difference in numbers"

Testing for the respiratory illness coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and the associated SARS-CoV-2 virus can be done by two main methods: molecular and serology. The first leverages polymerase chain reaction (PCR) along with nucleic acid tests and other advanced analytical techniques to detect the genetic material of the virus. The CDC in particular has developed a Real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction for diagnostic purposes. The second method, serology testing, leverages ELISA antibody test kits to detect the presence of antibodies produced by the host immune system against the virus.

* [SK health authorities say more than half of all cases are related to Shincheonji Church of Jesus](https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/01/asia/shincheonji-director-coronavirus-intl-hnk/index.html), where [40% of the sect's followers are aged 20 - 30](https://asia.nikkei.com/Spotlight/Coronavirus/Appeal-of-coronavirus-hit-cult-raises-tough-questions-for-South-Korea)
* The above could explain the abnormally large spike in cases for 20 - 30 year olds, which deviates from what is otherwise almost a perfect normal distribution centred at 50-59 years old
* The median age of South Korea is 41 years old, vs. 46 years old for Italy - this would explain why the ""normal"" part of their distribution peaks at a lower age in SK

To my understanding, you are correct that Italy is basically only testing symptomatic cases, so they observe a higher proportion of severe cases. This would explain why they [observe almost 10% of all recorded cases to be severe](https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/country/italy), as opposed to e.g. [SK](https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/country/south-korea/), [Germany](https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/country/germany/) , and most other places, which report severe cases to be in the 1-3% percent range.

All that to say, I don't think we can directly infer from this data alone that there is a disproportionate infectivity for 20 - 30 year olds - there are other complicating factors which seem to be responsible for that spike in cases. So I might expect that 29.9% to look more like 9% if we were able to sample the whole population."

A managing director of dievini Hopp BioTech Holding, which holds 80 percent of the company, said that an exclusive contract with the USA was out of the question.

Basically he forced the Fed to start up the money printing machine in an attempt to counter the economic impact of the coronavirus and prop up the stock market. This hurts banks since it lowers the amount of money that they make from interest.


Usually the Fed lowers rates by a quarter point during or right before recessions. Trump wanted to maintain the economic expansion into his second term since a recession would hurt his chance at reelection, so he put massive pressure on the Fed to start cutting rates (already at a historic low, especially this late in an economic expansion). Lowering rates and QE is the Fed's way of 'jump-starting' the economy into an expansion, but now the Fed is out of ammo to fight a recession, unless they start using negative interest rates (hyperinflation WHEEEEEEEE) or helicopter money.

With ZERO percent interest (IIRC the Fed's was the highest in the world's), all of the world's banks who relied on the relatively higher interest rates of the US are fucked.

edit: I should add that throughout this month, the Fed did the equivalent of injecting a person who just ran a marathon with a shot of adrenaline (the earlier 50bps cut), then slamming their face into an 8 ball of coke (cutting rates to zero) so that they can run another one."

Ultimately I think these moves by Mike DeWine are a knee jerk reaction and most likely too late at this point.

I work in healthcare and the real problem has been the lack of testing kits. Our hospital has a coronavirus hotline, and one of our nurses called it because she’s been sick for a month and had two indirect exposures to the virus. They told her she was low risk and didn’t need to get tested. By that alone, I can tell you this virus has broken the containment stage in Ohio. And while we can debate these move by Gov. Mike DeWine, ultimately it’s likely too late and now Ohio’s economy will be crippled while triggering other states to follow this same model which I’m not sure I agree with. 

The other problem is that Fox News has been downplaying this virus to millions of viewers who are of the age where it is most lethal. The real approach, which I think the original commenter was getting at but said it rather insensitively was that focus of quarantines should be be the elderly population and tons of education on that. However the focus of these quarantines are on age groups where the data shows next to no lethality."

# Clinical characteristics

As an emerging acute respiratory infectious disease, COVID-19 primarily spreads through the respiratory tract, by droplets, respiratory secretions, and direct contact \[41\] for a low infective dose \[42\]. Otherwise, it has been reported a SARS-CoV-2 was isolated from fecal swabs of a severe pneumonia patient on 10 February 2020 from a critical case in the Fifth Affiliated Hospital, Sun Yat-Sen University, Guangdong, China. Likewise, Zhang et al. \[43\] have found the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in fecal swabs and blood, indicating the possibility of multiple routes transmission. ACE2 protein presents in abundance on lung alveolar epithelial cells and enterocytes of small intestine remarkably \[44\], which may help understand the routes of infection and disease manifestations. Based on current epidemiological investigation, the incubation period is 1–14 days, mostly 3–7 days. And the COVID-19 is contagious during the latency period \[45\]. It is highly transmissible in humans, especially in the elderly and people with underlying diseases. The median age of patients is 47–59 years, and 41.9–45.7% of patients were females \[16, 41, 46\].

...

#  Clinical symptoms

A recent study led by Prof. Nan-Shan Zhong’s team, by sampling 1099 laboratory-confirmed cases, found that the common clinical manifestations included fever (88.7%), cough (67.8%), fatigue (38.1%), sputum production (33.4%), shortness of breath (18.6%), sore throat (13.9%), and headache (13.6%) \[16\]. In addition, a part of patients manifested gastrointestinal symptoms, with diarrhea (3.8%) and vomiting (5.0%). The clinical manifestations were in consistence with the previous data of 41, 99, and 138 patients analysis in Hubei province \[46, 48, 50\]. Fever and cough were the dominant symptoms whereas upper respiratory symptoms and gastrointestinal symptoms were rare, suggesting the differences in viral tropism as compared with SARS-CoV \[51\], MERS-CoV \[52\], and influenza \[53\]. The elderly and those with underlying disorders (i.e., hypertension, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, diabetes, cardiovascular disease), developed rapidly into acute respiratory distress syndrome, septic shock, metabolic acidosis hard to correct and coagulation dysfunction, even leading to the death \[48\] (lower panel, Fig. 1).

...

# Host immune response and immunopathology

The immune response is vital for the control and resolution of CoV infections, while it can also lead to immunopathogenesis, associated with the immune response out of control. The S proteins of Coronavirus binds to the host cells by ACE2, fusing to the membrane and release the viral RNA. The viral RNAs, as pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs), are detected by the pattern recognition receptors (PRRs). Usually, Toll-like receptor (TLR) 3, TLR7, TLR8, and TLR9 sense viral RNA and DNA in the endosome \[60, 61\]. The viral RNA receptor retinoic-acid inducible gene I (RIG-I) \[62\], cytosolic receptor melanoma differentiation-associated gene 5 (MDA5) and nucleotidyltransferase cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS) \[63\] are responsible for the recognition of viral RNA and DNA in the cytoplasm. These complex signalling recruit adaptors, including TIR-domain-containing adaptor protein including IFN-β (TRIF), mitochondrial antiviral-signalling protein (MAVS) \[64\] and stimulator of interferon genes protein (STING) \[65\] to trigger downstream cascades molecules, involving adaptor molecule MyD88 and lead to the activation of the transcription factor nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) and interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) and the production of type I Interferons (IFN-α /β) and a series of pro-inflammatory cytokines \[66\]. Hence, virus-cell interactions produce a diverse set of immune mediators against the invading virus \[67\].

...

### Antiviral treatments

Based on the experience of fighting the epidemic SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV previously, we may learn some lessons for some treatment strategies against coronavirus \[74\]. Antiviral drugs and systemic corticosteroid treatment commonly used in clinical practice previously, including neuraminidase inhibitors (oseltamivir, peramivir, zanamivir, etc), ganciclovir, acyclovir, and ribavirin, as well as methylprednisolone \[46, 75\] for influenza virus, are invalid for COVID-19 and not recommended. Remdesivir (GS-5734) is a 1′-cyano-substituted adenosine nucleotide analog prodrug and shows broad-spectrum antiviral activity against several RNA viruses. Based on the data collected from in vitro cell line and mouse model, remdesivir could interfere with the NSP12 polymerase even in the setting of intact ExoN proofreading activity \[76\]. Remdesivir has been reported to treat the first US case of COVID-19 successfully \[77\]. Chloroquine is a repurposed drug with great potential to treat COVID-19. Chloroquine has been used to treat malaria for many years \[78\], with a mechanism that is not well understood against some viral infections. Several possible mechanisms are investigated: Chloroquine can inhibit pH-dependent steps of the replication of several viruses \[79\], with a potent effect on SARS-CoV infection and spread \[80\].

Quantitative easing (QE), also known as large-scale asset purchases, is a monetary policy whereby a central bank buys predetermined amounts of government bonds or other financial assets in order to add money directly into the economy. An unconventional form of monetary policy, it is usually used when inflation is very low or negative, and standard expansionary monetary policy has become ineffective. A central bank implements quantitative easing by buying specified amounts of financial assets from commercial banks and other financial institutions, thus raising the prices of those financial assets and lowering their yield, while simultaneously increasing the money supply. This differs from the more usual policy of buying or selling short-term government bonds to keep interbank interest rates at a specified target value.

Yes, the virus is bad and has killed/will kill a lot of people. Most of the problem is that it's a new virus and there's nothing to combat it presently. However, it is manageable with measures being taken in a lot of countries, and people are taking them. Yes, there's a lot of countries where the infrastructure is unprepared to handle the amount of cases.

The big global problem here is internet sensationalism. The style of reporting almost makes it feel like we're dealing with a plague (which Corona is not, it's nowhere near as deadly or transmittable as, say, Ebola), and the 24-hour news cycle only being about one thing (Coronavirus) is aggravating the globe's mental health. Not to mention the plethora of misinformation and panic online that is pretty much inescapable right now.

There's plenty of examples of this. Tabloids and magazines in grocery stores. People posting pictures of empty shelves on reddit/twitter causes more people to freak out and try to hoard supplies. People are doomsday prepping, which just feeds into other peoples' paranoia.

I'm surprised that with all our advancements in understanding human psychology/sociology that there isn't more effort being put into not only mitigating the virus itself, but also minimizing the effect of widespread fear and panic. Because that can be just as damaging to society, especially when it can be hard to stay level-headed right now."

**tl;dr** \- The COVID-19 are cheap, simple, and routine practice for any biological lab. The money used to ""save"" the stock market could have paid to test everyone on Earth.

&#x200B;

**Many people believe the COVID-19 test is special, hard, and difficult. This is simply not the case. Evidence below:**

The Coronavirus test is simple and routine. It uses RT-PCR which has been around for AT LEAST TWO DECADE ([https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0166093498000032](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0166093498000032)). This assay comes in a ready-made kit for $171. The primers cost $4. Four...dollars.

A new kit does it for $0.23!!!

This was not some super secret special test. It is similar to many STD tests. Any lab anywhere could perform it. No special training required. For reasons.....the CDC and FDA greatly limited testing. America has great scientists. I know many of them. Despite that here we are. We are flying on our own.  


New kit- [https://www.biosearchtech.com/](https://www.biosearchtech.com/)…/2019-ncov-cdc-probe-and-pri…  
The kit- [https://www.qiagen.com/](https://www.qiagen.com/)…/top-se…/qiagen-onestep-rt-pcr-kit/…  
The primers- [https://www.biobasic.com/coronavirus-covid-19-primers](https://www.biobasic.com/coronavirus-covid-19-primers)  


&#x200B;

**Many people think the US just lacked the resources for the test. This is simply not true:**

I did the math. If you buy in bulk the RT-PCR kit cost $5.36 per reaction lets say you want to be really, really, really sure. So you run 3 sets of primers and in duplicate. That is 6 reactions per person. The three sets of primers cost about $9 each (2 primers make a set). That is $59.16 per patient. If we being super extra careful. In comparison, 1,758,668 chlamydia cases were confirmed last year. That is just the number of tests with positive results. Yet less than 12,000 people have been tested for COVID-19?  


The Government pushed 1.5 TRILLION into the market yesterday. That is enough for 25,354,969,574 or 25.3 billion people to be tested. Also known as TREE TIMES THE WORLD POPULATION.  


I have been informed there is a new test that costs $0.23 that is enough to test everyone on earth 846 times.  


We give out resources to the government in the form of taxes. We give up freedoms to uphold laws. In exchange for the government to protect us. That is the social contract we have made.  


They have failed us all deeply"

Went to lakeside Kroger and peters creek food lion yesterday. At Kroger there was no toilet paper. Most pasta was gone except for whole grain and the unicorn Mac and cheese. There was also no garlic, water bottles, milk, eggs, chicken and meat. 

Foodlion had pretty much everything except for tp. 

Pro tip the Hispanic and Asian markets had plenty of stuff and you'd be supporting a local business that heavily depends on traffic"
