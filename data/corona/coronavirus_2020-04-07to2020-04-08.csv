2020-04-07,PsychSiren,Coronavirus,78,https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/fwusyf/hospitals_say_feds_are_seizing_masks_and_other/fmqjh16/,">Although President Trump has directed states and hospitals to secure what supplies they can, the federal government is quietly seizing orders, leaving medical providers across the country in the dark about where the material is going and how they can get what they need to deal with the coronavirus pandemic.

>Hospital and clinic officials in seven states described the seizures in interviews over the past week. The Federal Emergency Management Agency is not publicly reporting the acquisitions, despite the outlay of millions of dollars of taxpayer money, nor has the administration detailed how it decides which supplies to seize and where to reroute them.

>Officials who’ve had materials seized also say they’ve received no guidance from the government about how or if they will get access to the supplies they ordered. That has stoked concerns about how public funds are being spent and whether the Trump administration is fairly distributing scarce medical supplies.

>“In order to have confidence in the distribution system, to know that it is being done in an equitable manner, you have to have transparency,” said Dr. John Hick, an emergency physician at Hennepin Healthcare in Minnesota who has helped develop national emergency preparedness standards through the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine.

>The medical leaders on the front lines of the fight to control the coronavirus and keep patients alive say they are grasping for explanations. ""We can't get any answers,"" said a California hospital official who asked not to be identified for fear of retaliation from the White House.

>In Florida, a large medical system saw an order for thermometers taken away. And officials at a system in Massachusetts were unable to determine where its order of masks went.

>“Are they stockpiling this stuff? Are they distributing it? We don’t know,” one official said. “And are we going to ever get any of it back if we need supplies? It would be nice to know these things.”

>PeaceHealth, a 10-hospital system in Washington, Oregon and Alaska, had a shipment of testing supplies seized recently. “It’s incredibly frustrating,"" said Richard DeCarlo, the system's chief operating officer.

>“We had put wheels in motion with testing and protective equipment to allow us to secure and protect our staff and our patients,” he said. “When testing went off the table, we had to come up with a whole new plan.”

>Although PeaceHealth doesn’t have hospitals in the Seattle area, where the first domestic coronavirus outbreak occurred, the system has had a steady stream of potentially infected patients who require testing and care by doctors and nurse in full protective equipment.

>Trump and other White House officials, including his close advisor and son-in-law Jared Kushner, have insisted that the federal government is using a data-driven approach to procure supplies and direct them where they are most needed.

>In response to questions from The Times, a FEMA representative said the agency, working with the Department of Health and Human Services and the Department of Defense, has developed a system for identifying needed supplies from vendors and distributing them equitably.

>The representative said the agency factors in the populations of states and major metropolitan areas and the severity of the coronavirus outbreak in various locales. “High-transmission areas were prioritized, and allocations were based on population, not on quantities requested,” the representative said.

>But the agency has refused to provide any details about how these determinations are made or why it is choosing to seize some supply orders and not others. Administration officials also will not say what supplies are going to what states.

>Using the Defense Production Act, a Korean War-era law that allows the president to compel the production of vital equipment in a national emergency, Trump last month ordered General Motors to produce ventilators to address shortfalls at hospitals.

>The law also empowers federal agencies to place orders for critical materials and to see that those get priority over orders from private companies or state and local governments.

>Experts say judicious use of this authority could help bring order to the medical supply market by routing critical material — ventilators, masks and other protective gear — from suppliers to the federal government and then to areas of greatest need, such as New York.

>Yet there is little indication that federal officials are controlling the market, as hospitals, doctors and others report paying exorbitant prices or resorting to unorthodox maneuvers to get what they need.

>Hospital and health officials describe an opaque process in which federal officials sweep in without warning to expropriate supplies.

>Jose Camacho, who heads the Texas Assn. of Community Health Centers, said his group was trying to purchase a small order of just 20,000 masks when his supplier reported that the order had been taken.

>Camacho was flabbergasted. Several of his member clinics — which as primary care centers are supposed to alleviate pressure on overburdened hospitals — are struggling to stay open amid woeful shortages of protective equipment

>“Everyone says you are supposed to be on your own,” Camacho said, noting Trump's repeated admonition that states and local health systems cannot rely on Washington for supplies. “Then to have this happen, you just sit there wondering what else you can do. You can’t fight the federal government.”"

However, as you know, the problem here is that Wisconsin failed to provide enough vote by mail ballots in the face of the Coronavirus pandemic, and the motion to extend the voting window (which included producing additional mail-in ballots and allowing them to be turned in after the original deadline) was shot down by the Wisconsin Supreme Court. Additionally, the number of in-person polling locations was diminished significantly.

These voters are being forced to risk their health in order to vote, through no fault of their own. And the GOP is entirely to blame for this fiasco."

The reality is that it’s very hard to hide an epidemic. Stopping a virus requires identifying and isolating cases of infection, and if you pretend to have done so when you really haven’t, the uncaught cases will grow exponentially. Maintaining a hidden set of real statistics and another set for show would require the secret collusion of China’s 2 million doctors and 3 million nurses—the kind of improbable cooperation that gives conspiracy theories a bad name.

China is slowly and carefully returning to a semblance of normalcy (**Science**, [3/29/20](https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2020/03/can-china-return-normalcy-while-keeping-coronavirus-check)).  If China is merely pretending to have the coronavirus under control, the pathogen will rapidly surge as people resume interacting with their communities. Once international travel is restored, it will be quite obvious which countries do and don’t have effective management of Covid-19.

Until then, news outlets can serve the public by quoting health experts on the reliability of health statistics, rather than politicians.

I mean, I know you're probably kidding(? not sure), but there's a context behind this. Save for a couple of LGUs, both the local and national government have been SEVERELY lacking in regards with the COVID-19 response. For example, the government has a Php275 Billion budget for the COVID-19 outbreak, but the funds until now have [yet to be properly allocated](https://www.rappler.com/nation/255559-duterte-government-no-breakdown-billions-to-be-tapped-coronavirus-response) and people are getting antsy, especially because of the [lack of transparency and actual distribution of goods](https://www.rappler.com/entertainment/news/256459-celebrity-reactions-duterte-coronavirus-press-conference-march-30-2020). For the local governments, one example of this is the [slow response of the Quezon City mayor](https://news.abs-cbn.com/news/03/20/20/qcs-belmonte-hits-complaints-of-slow-covid-19-response). Quezon City is [the most populous city in the Philippines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quezon_City). Instead of reassuring the citizens of the city, the mayor then posts a social media post saying that [people who criticized her should not get any provisions from the local gov't](https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1253550/belmonte-i-sincerely-apologize-for-losing-my-composure-on-social-media). This, and a couple more incidents, led to [some protesters ignoring the lockdown and instead rallying against her](https://www.cnnphilippines.com/news/2020/4/1/quezon-city-protesters-arrested-.html). Take note that the Philippines is a third-world country, that many of our citizens are either out-of-work or living paycheck-to-paycheck. The lockdown is necessary, of course, but the funds are there and people are getting pissed because we are either not receiving provisions that we should be getting, or the government is seriously skimping out on us. We do, however, have competent officials that are actually doing their best to help us. Pasig City Mayor Vico Sotto is an example of that. What does he get for serving his constituents? [Thinly veiled threats](https://www.philstar.com/headlines/2020/03/21/2002424/duterte-lgus-stand-down-follow-guidelines) from an insecure president who's worried that some local government officials are getting more praise than him. He ordered LGUs to ""follow guidelines and abide by the directives set by the national government"" when they have yet to release a concrete plan to combat the virus except for the lockdown. Furthermore, that same mayor was hit by an [investigation by the National Bureau of Investigation](https://www.cnnphilippines.com/news/2020/4/1/nbi-vico-sotto-luzon-quarantine.html) for a violation of quarantine policy that was implemented days after the act that he's being investigated for (which was simply mobilizing tricycles in the city to transport health workers). So what is the national government doing? What does Duterte say in his press conference? [A shoot to kill order for the quarantine violators](https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2020/04/philippines-president-duterte-shoot-to-kill-order-pandemic/) and him saying that [he has warned the public of the COVID-19 weeks before the pandemic spread](https://coconuts.co/manila/news/i-told-you-so-duterte-says-he-warned-public-about-covid-19-calls-govt-desperate/) when he have receipts that [he obviously severely downplayed this virus](https://old.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/fwfmi1/receipts_clownery_at_its_finest/). Citizens are asking for weeks, when are we getting mass-tested? The answer, which we only got days ago, is on [April 14](https://www.cnnphilippines.com/news/2020/4/3/coronavirus-mass-testing-philippines.html). Why April 14? Because our health insurance will only cover COVID-19 patients until [April 14](https://twitter.com/manilabulletin/status/1247383009235308545?s=20), and people would have to pay to be tested after that.


And, like I said, this is just the tip of the iceberg.


ALSO, it's worth noting that no one actually wants to violate the government-imposed lockdown. It's just that some Filipinos have no other choice, or see no other way of being heard by government officials."

I am writing these words in response to repeated requests from many people around the world. Today, we are passing through an exceptionally difficult time due to the outbreak of the coronavirus pandemic.

In addition to this, further problems confront humanity such as extreme climate change. I would like to take this opportunity to express my admiration and gratitude to governments across the world, including the Government of India, for the steps they are taking to meet these challenges.

Ancient Indian tradition describes the creation, abiding and destruction of worlds over time. Among the causes of such destruction are armed conflict and disease, which seems to accord with what we are experiencing today. However, despite the enormous challenges we face, living beings, including humans, have shown a remarkable ability to survive.

No matter how difficult the situation may be, we should employ science and human ingenuity with determination and courage to overcome the problems that confront us. Faced with threats to our health and well-being, it is natural to feel anxiety and fear. Nevertheless, I take great solace in the following wise advice to examine the problems before us: If there is something to be done—do it, without any need to worry; if there’s nothing to be done, worrying about it further will not help.

Everyone at present is doing their best to contain the spread of the coronavirus. I applaud the concerted efforts of nations to limit the threat. In particular, I appreciate the initiative India has taken with other SAARC countries to set up an emergency fund and an electronic platform to exchange information, knowledge and expertise to tackle the spread of Covid-19. This will serve as a model for dealing with such crises in future as well.

I understand that as a result of the necessary lockdowns across the world, many people are facing tremendous hardship due to a loss of livelihood. For those with no stable income life is a daily struggle for survival. I earnestly appeal to all concerned to do everything possible to care for the vulnerable members of our communities.

I offer special gratitude to the medical staff—doctors, nurses and other support personnel—who are working on the frontline to save lives at great personal risk. Their service is indeed compassion in action.

With heartfelt feelings of concern for my brothers and sisters around the world who are passing through these difficult times, I pray for an early end to this pandemic so that your peace and happiness may soon be restored.
 
With my prayers,

Dalai Lama"""

Look at SECNAVs remark right after the letter was released:

>Acting Navy Secretary Thomas Modly said the warnings Capt. Brett Crozier raised about the health of his crew went through the proper channels.

>“This is what we want our commanding officers to be able to do,” Mr. Modley told reporters at the Pentagon. “We want that information to flow up through the chain of command.”

Why the complete 180? Oh...

>Washington Post reports that Modly told a colleague the day before Crozier was removed from his post: “Breaking news: Trump wants him fired.”

Additionally, the number of in-person polling locations was diminished significantly.

2020-04-07,Noisy_Toy,Coronavirus,15,https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/fwxykr/detroit_hospital_nurses_refuse_to_work_without/fmr3gpd/,"(CNN) — Emergency room nursing staff at a Detroit hospital were told to leave Sunday night after they refused to work and demanded more nurses be brought into their overrun emergency room, health care workers there told CNN.

The night shift ER nurses at Sinai-Grace Hospital refused to leave the break room until hospital administrators brought in more nurses to help out, a physician at the hospital told CNN.

Hospital administrators decided, **after four hours of deliberation**, they would not be bringing in any more nurses to help and that the nurses could get to work or leave the hospital, the doctor said.

Some did then leave, said the physician, who spoke to CNN on the condition of anonymity out of concern for their job.

The details provided by the physician were corroborated by ER nurse Sal Hadwan, who discussed what happened in a video livestreamed on Facebook. 

—— 
 

""We are disappointed that last night a very small number of nurses at Sinai-Grace Hospital staged a work stoppage in the hospital refusing to care for patients,"" Detroit Medical Center Communications Manager Jason Barczy told CNN. ""Despite this, our patients continued to receive the care they needed as other dedicated nurses stepped in to provide care.""

Sinai-Grace is part of the Detroit Medical Center system.

""We know this is a very challenging time for caregivers,"" Barczy said. ""Our doctors and nurses continue to demonstrate their commitment and dedication to our patients.""

In the video, Hadwan said he and the other ER nurses shown were told leave the hospital.

""Tonight, it was the breaking point for us,"" Hadwan said in the video, streamed on Sunday night right before midnight.

Inside an ER during the coronavirus outbreak
""Because we cannot safely take care of your loved ones out here with just six, seven nurses and multiple (ventilators) and multiple people on drips. It's not right. **We had two nurses the other day who had 26 patients with 10 (ventilators).”**

The nurses need extra help, because for **three straight weeks they’ve had more than 110 patients in the ER**, Hadwan said in the video.

""Nurses around the state are desperately doing everything we can to keep our patients and ourselves safe,"" Michigan Nurses Association President Jamie Brown told CNN.

""Eventually, a tipping point is reached where the best thing any RN can do for their patients, their families, and their coworkers is to speak out rather than remain silent.""

Coronavirus deaths jump in New York, but governor says hospitalizations are plateauing and distancing &#39;is working&#39;
""Until hospitals start taking the concerns of nurses seriously, it's only a matter of time before more actions like these occur. It is absolutely essential that hospitals start working with nurses and stop silencing our voices,"" Brown said.

After the nightside nurses were told to leave, the **dayside nurses were told they needed to continue working — meaning they would work a 24-hour shift**, according to Hadwan.

Hadwan said Monday night that the hospital was bringing in four agency nurses to help the nightside crew."

So it seems like he too could be alluring to the fact that higher turnouts favour Democrats, though it's unclear whether that specifically was what he meant, but afaik there has been no alternative clarification by his administration yet."

DOJ announcement: https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/department-justice-issues-business-review-letter-medical-supplies-distributors-supporting


Petition letter: https://www.justice.gov/atr/page/file/1266516/download



Review response: https://www.justice.gov/atr/page/file/1266511/download


Generally I get why this all might make sense but the gist seems to be making the case that a) it's not an issue b/c anti trust staff is in the same meetings b) even if these companies did do illegal anti trust behavior the doj would not be able to or want to prosecute. 


The guy who wrote the DOJ response letter isn't really into antitrust enforcement - see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Makan_Delrahim


Couple that with these Blue Flame Medical LLC folks: 

https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/27/republican-fundraiser-company-coronavirus-152184

And .... Blueflame is the first link for ppe materials https://www.nga.org/coronavirus-resources/

Either Blueflame is getting product from these suppliers, or has access to buy from the HHS/Fema stockpiles (at cost) that these folks in the DOJ letter are building. 

It seems like the DOJ has blessed a set of private firms to price, source supply, and distribute the HHS and FEMA stockpiles. This group is free to collude and act on behalf of federal agencies even if their representatives aren't around - as long as it's covid-19 related and covid-19 is still a thing.


So private distributors seem to be in a position to make bank on either side of the federal supply stockpile AND corner the market on very scarce high demand disposable goods - with basically no oversight or accountability - and the states are in a bidding war to save lives.

Seizing existing shipments and re-routung them to the stockpile for resale would be an extension of cornering the maket. 

Oh and the guy who was appointed to oversee the integrity of the stimulus distribution got fired today ... https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/wireStory/trump-sidelines-watchdog-tapped-virus-rescue-oversight-70023103

So now the bailout funds going to states can be spent on supply auctions without any fuss. 



Now I could be totally wrong, and shipments of much needed supplies could just start showing up where and when they are needed without states paying gonzo prices for goods .... But im not betting on it."

2020-04-07,Kmlevitt,japan,12,https://www.reddit.com/r/japan/comments/fwxjaq/what_are_some_ways_the_japanese_government_failed/fmr3hw8/,"* Calling for a block/quarantine of Chinese visitors to Japan far too late for it to have any effect. By the time they did it the virus was already loose in Japan anyway.  It was a difficult call for them to make, because Japan’s economy has become more and more reliant on their tourism. 

*  Bungling the Diamond Princess “quarantine”.  An expert who got on board heavily criticized it. Eventually nearly a third of the ships passengers wound up getting it. 

*  The Ministry of health didn’t even test their own workers for the virus after they left the ship. When asked why, they said because it could hinder them in performing their future duties.  I think that was the first clear sign that the people in charge of this really didn’t know what they were doing. 

*  they let one passenger from the diamond princess leave the ship untested and go home on public transport. 

* they didn’t aggressively test the population for the virus; in Tokyo 98.5% of people who request a test are rejected.  Although a number of theories have been floated for why this is, a major one they have explicitly mentioned is cost. This is in contrast to South Korea, who has tested literally 10 times as many people (and whose active count cases are now going down rather than up, recently dropping to be fewer than Japan’s currently). Since they didn’t test aggressively, the numbers looked good on paper. And since the numbers looked good on paper, the government appeared to be justified in not calling for stricter containment measures which might hurt the economy or risk the prospects of holding the Olympics this year. 

*  put the minister of economic revitalization in charge of the coronavirus task force, which presents something of a conflict of interest; safeguarding the public health necessarily means harming the economy, at least for the short term. 

* Abe only called the state of emergency in April,  after pressure from city governors and the Japan medical Association. As late as a week before he was still calling the prospect of it happening “fake news“. 

*  even after calling the state of emergency, made it clear that he was not going to call for a lockdown, and explicitly said that he did not believe a lockdown was necessary. People will tell you a lockdown is not technically possible due to the constitution, but the point is he is still not even interested in doing his best to attempt one via indirect measures.  It’s one thing to not have the power to really enforce these orders. It’s another to repeatedly remind everybody of that fact  and talk about the importance of keeping the economy going through all this. 

*  even now, the head of his coronavirus task force is negotiating with the Tokyo governor about what will and will not be requested to shut down on Friday. For some reason his government wants to keep hairdressers open throughout April (?)

TL,DR:

-  putting the interest of business over people. (for example, for a long time he was telling businesse leaders that employees could simply use sick days and personal leave days if they got sick with the virus.)

- prioritizing the Olympics over public health. 

- prioritizing the economy over public health. 

Abe saw how the great financial crisis got the LDP thrown out of office. The strategy has always seemed to be keep the economy good, which keeps people happy.  It’s actually not that different from Trump in the states, who is always working to push the stock market.

What he doesn’t seem to grasp is that eventually a lockdown will be unavoidable, at least in Tokyo. The longer he tries to put it off, the worse it will ultimately be in the end. I think most voters will remember how long it took him to get in front of this problem and that he will wind up taking much of the blame."

Yes, of course, and that's what puts the Dolphins in such a great position. They have three first-round picks (Nos. 5, 18 and 26) and two second-round picks (Nos. 39 and 56), which means they have the capital to trade up to get their guy, or wait it out if they like Justin Herbert or Jordan Love.
What's going against Tagovailoa right now is that the Dolphins can't do an in-person checkup with their team doctor (the latest reports are that Tagovailoa has recovered from his hip and ankle injuries) because of the travel restrictions as part of the coronavirus pandemic. Prospects can only do virtual visits with teams, and that could have an effect on guys who are rehabbing injuries.
There has been some buzz around Herbert to Miami, but it's still early. He is likely to be on the board at No. 5, whereas the Dolphins might have to trade up for Tagovailoa. Do they like Tagovailoa enough to use some of that capital to trade up? What happens if both quarterbacks are on the board at No. 5? That's what makes Miami the most interesting team in this draft.

Where would Daniel Jones and Kyler Murray rank in this quarterback class? (via @11423_80917)
This is a tough one. Really tough. Because where would Murray have been picked last year if Kliff Kingsbury wasn't the coach in Arizona? That's an interesting hypothetical, which makes him the wild card. I had Murray ranked No. 6 overall on my final Big Board, while Jones was my fourth-ranked quarterback at No. 23 overall (Dwayne Haskins was No. 7; Drew Lock was No. 21).
OK, I'll take a stab at ranking them, based on my pre-draft grades:
* 		Joe Burrow, LSU
* 		Tua Tagovailoa, Alabama
* 		Kyler Murray, Oklahoma
* 		Justin Herbert, Oregon
* 		Daniel Jones, Duke
* 		Jordan Love, Utah State
This is not an exact science, but I'm basing this list on how I thought of Murray and Jones going into the 2019 draft.

Who is your favorite prospect in this class? (via @BrunelliSports)
OK, I'm told I can only pick one prospect, so I'll take the biggest in the class. Louisville offensive tackle Mekhi Becton is a giant, a 6-foot-7, 364-pound people-mover with great feet, long arms and stellar athleticism; he awed scouts at the combine with a 5.1 40. You really don't see these types of athletes come around often. Becton also has a mean streak, and he was phenomenal last season. There's a reason he's my top-ranked tackle.

How good is this year's wide receiver class compared to the best groups you've studied? (via @Brandnewusedcar)
The depth separates this class from any other year. I've been studying the NFL draft for more than 40 years, and this could be the deepest ever. Now, that doesn't mean it's the best, because there are classes that have produced a few superstars (go look at two of the top six picks in 2011). But I have given 30 draftable grades to wideouts in this class -- that number could still rise -- and I put seven in the first round of my Mock Draft 3.0. We might never see something like this again, but it's coming at the right time because there are several receiver-needy teams across the league.
At the top of my rankings are Alabama's Jerry Jeudy, Oklahoma's CeeDee Lamb and Jeudy's teammate Henry Ruggs III. These three are in a tier by themselves. Check out my full position rankings here.

Which wide receiver is the Terry McLaurin of this draft? (via @Big305Country)
You're talking about a midround steal, right? Here's a name for you: Antonio Gibson. He is a former junior college star who spent two seasons at Memphis and really emerged in 2019, averaging 19.3 yards per catch, 11.2 yards per carry and 28 yards per kickoff return. At 6-foot, 228 pounds, Gibson is not a traditional receiver, but he could be used in several ways by a smart coaching staff, on jet sweeps and screens and quick-game concepts while he develops as a route runner. And he is extremely explosive after the catch -- he ran a 4.39 40-yard dash at the combine. Gibson's versatility makes him a perfect third-round target with upside.

Does Jalen Hurts have any chance to be drafted in the late first or early second round? (via @ryanhallwrites)
No, I don't think so. Late second round is probably Hurts' ceiling. I know teams like him, but he's not in the first tier of quarterbacks and will likely be drafted after Jacob Eason (Washington).
There are some interesting possibilities for the Oklahoma QB, though. If the Raiders pass on a quarterback in Round 1 -- they have two picks -- could they target one in Round 3, where they have three picks? What about Tampa Bay, which just brought back Blaine Gabbert to be Tom Brady's backup? If the Chargers really are going to stick with Tyrod Taylor for the short term, could they target Hurts as a developmental prospect in the third round?

With no first-round picks, what should the Bears address with their two second-round picks? (via @Danny_Bobrowski)
One of those picks should be a wide receiver; they could find a No. 2 wideout opposite Allen Robinson II at Nos. 43 or 50. If Arizona State's Brandon Aiyuk is still available, he'd be a fit.
The other pick could come down to offensive tackle or cornerback, because Chicago needs to address the positions. It could try to find a young prospect to push Bobby Massie and Charles Leno Jr., or it could survey the defensive backs available. If Alabama's Trevon Diggs or TCU's Jeff Gladney are around in the middle of Round 2, the Bears should think hard.

Who do you like better between Derrick Brown and Javon Kinlaw, and who has more upside? (via @dcaw90)
This is close because they are both elite defensive tackle prospects, but Brown gets the edge. The 6-foot-4, 326-pounder was more productive and more consistent overall at Auburn, even if he didn't always take down quarterbacks. He's No. 6 on my board right now. Kinlaw (6-foot-5, 324 pounds), though, might have the higher ceiling. He's a tremendous athlete, even if he wasn't able to do work out at the combine and won't have a pro day. He's No. 14 on my board.

Which position group isn't deep in this class, and could it cause teams to reach for prospects? (via @PopeJ88)
It's the tight ends. There's not much consensus inside the league on the top five, although there is some talent. There might not be any first-round tight ends. Even the top-ranked guy -- Notre Dame's Cole Kmet -- has some questions. He really only played one full season for the Fighting Irish, catching 43 passes for 515 yards and six touchdowns. Kmet is a good player, but he has some inconsistent tape.
Still, I could see teams reaching for someone like Albert Okwuegbunam (Missouri), who ran a 4.49 40 at the combine at 258 pounds. The talent is there, but I gave him a third-round grade. Hunter Bryant (Washington) is another one to watch in Round 2, but he's really just a big wide receiver.

Who is the most underrated player in this draft from Round 3 on? (via @Sketz12)
I'll give you one for both sides of the ball. Liberty's Antonio Gandy-Golden gets lost in a loaded wide receiver class, but he can play. At 6-foot-4, he has a massive wingspan and catch radius, but he's also good after the catch. He's going to help a team in 2020, even if he lasts until the fourth or fifth round.
On defense, give me Baylor's James Lynch, the 2019 Big 12 Defensive Player of the Year. He's kind of a tweener tackle/end, but I see him as a 3-technique tackle in a 4-3 defense because he has some pass-rush ability. And he's relentless. He could be a steal in the third or fourth round.

Which prospect could surprise us and drop to the third day of the draft (via @dubydavis)
I'll give you two names again. Colorado wide receiver Laviska Shenault Jr. had a tremendous 2018 season, then was let down by poor quarterback play last season. His numbers dropped significantly. Then, he got injured and couldn't do all of the drills at the combine, before having surgery to repair a core muscle injury in March. I just don't have a good handle on his draft range yet; he looks like a first-rounder on his 2018 tape, but he could fall if teams don't have a handle on his injury and rehab. I don't think he lasts to Round 4, but I wouldn't be completely shocked. He's a wild card.
The defender is outside linebacker Curtis Weaver, who had 23 sacks over the past two seasons at Boise State. I thought he might be a top-20 pick in November, but he didn't test well at the combine, and he has dropped to No. 8 in my OLB rankings. He's a solid prospect, just not elite.

Whom should the Bengals target at No. 33? (via @BengalsLa)
Love this question. Everyone is talking about Joe Burrow at No. 1, but Cincinnati has a valuable pick at the top of Round 2. Offensive line was the first position that came to mind because there are going to be some really good tackles on the board. If the Bengals can get their right tackle of the future -- Ezra Cleveland (Boise State) or Austin Jackson (USC) are possibilities -- they should do it. Remember that 2019 first-round pick Jonah Williams missed his rookie season but will be back at left tackle in 2020, so that would be a good pair of tackles around Burrow.
I mentioned earlier that this isn't a great tight end class, but Cole Kmet (Notre Dame) would help Cincy immediately, even though it took Drew Sample in the second round a year ago. I'm also high on Texas Tech linebacker Jordyn Brooks, a sideline-to-sideline inside linebacker who could upgrade this team's front seven.

Which running back is most NFL-ready? (via @ShoneSmash)
D'Andre Swift. The Georgia star can do it all. He makes tacklers miss on huge gains, and he's the best pass-catching back in the class. If any back goes in Round 1 this year, it'll be Swift.

If you were running Washington, what is the minimum trade package you would take from Miami to trade down from No. 2 to No. 5? (via @DanielGoldblatt)"

9/11 surrounding the 2001 recession probably felt insane (I was too young, ha!). 2008 + housing crisis. 2020 + coronavirus.

But we’ve survived them all and we’ll survive this one, too. Plus time between recessions appear to be lengthening (though not steadily/linear) - 1991-2001-2008-2020... vs like every 3 years in the 40s, etc.

That’s if we enter a recession. Worst case. There you go. And I’ve been speculating that we’d exit a recession more quickly these days anyway due to tech advancements but I’m no economist so take that one with a grain of salt."

If they're gossiping to you, they're gossiping about you. I have no respect for gossips. Also - don't tell anyone anything you wouldn't want the entire office to know.
* Same goes for the rumor mill. The ones who claim to know the most generally know the least. Go to the source, use critical thinking, or come to this subreddit - lots of experienced people lurking here.
* And finally, the previous two examples also apply to office drama. Stay out of it. Anyone trying to ""get you on their side"" in some sort of office personality bullshit is usually the one causing the problem. Be an adult.
* Show up on time, do your work, leave when you're supposed to, look for opportunities to advance and contribute.
* The office OT is your friend. Be nice to the people below you. A little genuine kindness and consideration can come in handy when you need a favor. Don't be shy about buying them lunch or something appropriate on occasion to say thanks.
* Stay in your lane. There are office busybodies and nosey dipshits who can't help but worry about what everyone else is doing. They like to play office cop and come here to ask stupid questions about whistleblowing and union grievances. If you think you're seeing something serious or illegal, then get advice about how to handle it. But if you're just complaining because you think someone's not doing their job, being a gossip, or you just don't like them, you likely need more work to do.
* Learn as much as you can. See if you can find the answer before asking questions. If you have a problem you think needs your manager's input, come to them with a solution or two.
* Be courteous, professional, polite, ethical and hardworking. You never know when someone you used to work with might be in a position to help or hire you. Let your reputation precede you in the best ways possible. Be the co-worker you'd want to have on your team.
* If you don't have anything to do, ask for something to do. See if a colleague or manager needs help with something. Failing that, grab a manual and start learning policies and procedures.
* Office potlucks/birthdays/retirements are to be avoided at all costs. Thank goodness for the coronavirus right now. Although I do miss lumpia.

Good luck."

The case count data is, in my opinion, largely useless for drawing any conclusions for a few reasons: It's non-randomized, inclusive of re-tests to an unknown degree, and has unclear to the public - and likely shifting - criteria for who's getting tested. For those reasons, and because it's limited/bottlenecked/delayed, we honestly have no idea what the actual trend for infections looks like right now. If we knew for a fact that the testing criteria had remained largely the same throughout the past two weeks, that might make me feel more confident in watching how the rate of positive tests was changing, but...we just don't know (or, I don't. Maybe someone here does). It's possible it's an accurate representation! But, it's really hard to say given all the unknowns.  

OP linked it in his comment, but I'd read this if you haven't: [https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/coronavirus-case-counts-are-meaningless/](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/coronavirus-case-counts-are-meaningless/) 

Hospitalizations and deaths *should* be a better barometer for where we are, but even those numbers are potentially badly flawed. The New York Times was reporting today an outsized number of deaths at home, either due to hospital capacity constraints or a lower willingness for people to go to the hospital for other reasons. It's unclear whether they were caused by COVID, but it's likely at least some were, and those never wound up in a hospital to be officially counted. And apparently there's problems with attribution even in a hospital setting. 

To be honest with you, nothing has been more frustrating to me in this whole mess than the sheer lack of quality, reliable data on *anything*. It frustrates me partially because numbers usually give me comfort, but it's even more frustrating because I know policy makers are basically flying blind. 

All a long way of saying: in my opinion, it's hard to believe we *haven't* had an impact and timing/logic would suggest we're likely within a few days right now - give or take - of our peak # of infections, but the raw data is too flawed to confidently tell us where we are on ""the curve"". I'd likely wait until *all* the key metrics (rate of case growth, daily hospitalizations, daily fatalities) are moving in the right direction before feeling super confident about things."

His poor baby boy had sat up in order to take the soup, sweaty heaving chest with beautifully smooth skin all exposed, his moobies moving with his breathing in a hypnotic motion, so the soup landed on that nubile skin. 

Deadpool gasped, tears streaming down his face like Viagra Falls.

He’d soiled his adorable spider.

He stripped off his red shirt (probably from all the blood) sexily, swaying like a snake hypnotizing prey to distract Spidey from the scalding soup on his chest.

Deadpool’s abs swayed in the wind with him, his baby boy’s spheres locked onto his tantalizing smooth form with no scars because Deadpool was an attractive motherfucker with skin like a baby.

While Spidey was distracted, he mopped up the soup on Spidey’s chest with his shirt, taking the opportunity to trail a hand down his Spidey’s perky nibbly nipples. 

He must’ve been too distracted by Spidey’s general aura of succulentness (probably like a Rosularia) because Spidey cursed when Deadpool’s drool dripped onto the spots he had just cleaned. 

“Oh Deadpool, your drool is all over me! Whatever shall we do? I don’t want to get Covid-20. ” Spidey sighed, arching his back and neck in a very sinuous way so as to show off all that strength that could shake and snap Deadpool like a glowstick.

So fucking sexy. 

Deadpool cried, tears wetting his cheeks like how wet he’d been that one time Spidey carried him on his back and they swung through the city.

Or how wet he was when he bled out after having the bottom half of his torso torn off.

Both were very applicable to his current situation obviously.

“Don’t worry Spidey, I have a solution!” Deadpool wouldn’t do his Spidey dirty like that, so he took off his blue shirt (from all the smurf blood) and flexed his abs, using that to distract his Spidey like morphine distracts from the horrors of life, like the inevitability of death or like the fact that his father never wanted him- 

Anyways, he ripped off his shirt with his bare hands because he’s strong and buff, and wiped down Spidey’s chest with it.

He pulled out another tray of bussy soup from under his skirt, ready to feed Spidey. 

“Here comes the airplane!” Deadpool made zooming sounds and then a few machine gun sounds just for realism to make sure Spidey knew the airplane was being shot out of the sky to land in his mouth, but when Spidey opened his mouth like a little baby bird and Deadpool was the mama bird, it was so adorable that his asscheeks clenched.

The bussy soup spilled onto Spidey’s neck, and Deadpool cried, his tears falling down his face like a rain scene in a 90’s boyband music video.

“Spidey, I'm dummy thicc and the clap of my asscheeks keeps making me spill this soup.” 

Deadpool pulled off his white shirt (probably from all the cum) to wipe up the soup but then he realized, this train of shirts would never end, just like his search for his beloved Spidey who still hasn’t called him, and the tears came back stronger than ever. 

“Deadpool, you know what you have to do,” Spidey intoned solemnly, his spheres bright with starlight and like, all the good shit in the world, probably powerpuff girl essence or something. 

Deadpool perked up, both his body and his mind (and his dinkle winkle). “You’re right Spidey, you’re covered in soup and we’re out of toilet paper due to some fucking hoarders due to coronavirus-”

Deadpool took out his gun from under his skirt and shot it out the now destroyed window.

Someone screamed.

He hoped it was Ted from next door who had hoarded all the toilet paper from Ralphs.

Fucking hoarders. 

“So I guess the ONLY solution is for me to clean you with my tongue!”

Spidey fluttered his orb-lashes like the elegant wings of a butterfly, a soft sigh falling out of him like boulders down a mountain. “Deadpool, your talented tongue can cleanse me of anything! Maybe of my deadly coronavirus?” 

“Not your covid-19 but, for everything else...? Oh it sure will, baby boy.” 

Deadpool proceeded to acquaint himself with every inch of Spidey’s delicious body, his tongue drew a dick with a trail of saliva.

One might question how much saliva Deadpool really had but when you’re near someone like Spidey 24/7 it’s a non-stop Thirst Town. 

Spidey moaned, his horny motor revving up and turning on from the stimulating tongue massage Deadpool was giving him, bathing his skin like a momma cat does to a kitten. 

“Deadpool, more…” 

And who was Deadpool to deny the call of his godly baby college boy, the sheathe to his katana, the peel to his banana you get the picture (and it’s a very smexy picture). 

Deadpool reached over to the bedside table for the lube, but found that they had used it up because they bounced on each other’s dicks like bunnies during the beginning of the outbreak quarantine social distancing, like so much. 

“Baby boy, we’re out of lube, and we can’t go out to get it because we’re in quarantine.” Deadpool lamented, his peen already deflating like a balloon with a sad fart sound, from the lack of action in the near future. 

“Then it’s a good thing we have this,” Spidey sensually whispered as he slid a bottle of hand sanitizer out from under the pillow.

The pump was still new and wrapped, beckoning to Deadpool like the holy grail, if the holy grail could get his dick wet. 

Deadpool paused. “Was that there this whole time? You were just sleeping on a bottle of hand sanitizer?” 

Spidey hissed and hugged the bottle to his chest, noticeable war flashbacks passing through his glowing orbs. “Those hoarders are feral. My other lov- I mean my friend Demetri bought it for me.”

“Ah,” Deadpool nodded in understanding as he grabbed the bottle and after removing the wrapping, pumped some into his hand. “Well then, I’m sure this will be the safest sex we’ve ever had,” Deadpool growled out like a puma prowling for pussy.

“After all,” He continued with a careless whisper and a saxophone solo, leaning in and trailing his hand sanitized fingers to Spidey’s bootyhole, ready to plunder that booty. “It’s doctor approved and kills 99.9% of all bacteria.”

His fingers entered the moistened tunnel like a train and plowed through to properly open up Spidey for his locomotive steam engine.

Deadpool’s hose dripped in anticipation as Spidey laid on his back, beckoning to him as his cockadoodle springs up like a beacon.

He couldn’t wait to rail him like the Little Engine That Could (though his train was by no means little).

“Choo choo, Big Boy coming through,” Deadpool moaned out as he held Spidey’s incredibly juicy flexible thighs up, so that he could get to those bouncy glutes. “My angle cock isn’t braking anytime soon, honey. Full steam ahead!”

The hand sanitizer lube helped slick the way for Deadpool’s massive Eiffel Tower and Spidey let out squeals of pain and pleasure that only Deadpool could pull out of him because Spidey loved him very much.

“Oh Deadpool, I could feel your love burning inside of me - oh wait, that might just be the hand sanitizer. It may be doctor approved but I’m not sure it’s bussy approved.”

Deadpool hissed alongside his lover as he felt the sanitizer cleaning his monstrous membrane. “This feels just like when I won a competition to get the exclusive box set of the Golden Girls. Except I didn’t win, the rest of the losers just ‘mysteriously’ died.” 

“Did you kill them, Deadpool? Oh, how sexy of you!” Spidey groaned as he clawed at Deadpool’s back, the maid outfit bouncing cheerily along to every thrust. 

“Oh yes, I would kill anyone for you my thicccccc Thoticus, my slutty salsa, my dicky duck.”

“What a big, strong man you are Deadpool! I love you and your beautiful bazooka the size of the Chrysler Building.”

“My snickerdoodle is only ever wet for you,” Deadpool confessed like a sinner at church (The last time Hozier tried to take him to church, his daddy issues came rearing up). “And unicorns, and Thomas the Tank Engine, and basically a stiff wind. And everything else.” 

“That’s so sexy I think I’m going to cum all over your maid outfit! Ugh my coronavirus-riddled prostate!”

“Yes, Spidey, cum for me!” 

Spidey let out the most adorable shout of pleasure as he arched his back and released his essence into the wind, blessing Deadpool with his holy water.

Deadpool followed soon after and let the sexy times distract him from the impending sense of doom that was the state of their current health care system.

After all, Weapon X didn’t have a dental plan with their health insurance. 

Spidey was still panting when Deadpool pressed their lips together and battled for dominance, this time it was a jousting competition and Spidey definitely won that one because Deadpool did not know how to ride a horse. 

Spidey looked up at him with love in his orbs, the way he only ever looked at tacos and science.

“I think I’m healed Deadpool, your magical train of love was so potent and your juice so healing that I no longer have Covid-19.” 

“I think you still have it, Spider-Man.” Deadpool moaned. “And I’m so happy you do.”"

It's similar to how people can buy free-roam chicken at the grocery store right now as well as ""regular"" chicken that doesn't have a great life, yet still most people buy the latter because the price difference isn't exactly marginal.

Long story short: we would absolutely be better off on an ethical level if we cut all ties with China, but on an economical level we can't do it any time soon. Especially after the hit the economy is taking from the coronavirus situation right now."

because pink news has added a retraction to its own column on his diagnosis indicating that the “punishment” remark had been falsely reported to begin with (so the “honest reporting” summary appears to be correct and corroborated in at least that respect).

pink news does continue to report that he is a known homophobe (not really shocking for a religious conservative), but they are not standing by his having attributed coronavirus to divine punishment. 

it obviously can be true both that he is homophobic and that he was falsely attributed with a quote.

edit: clarified a “they” as “pink news”

edit 2: ok, found a [now formerly?] working msn [link ](https://www.msn.com/en-gb/news/world/israel-health-minister-who-claims-coronavirus-is-divine-punishment-for-homosexuality-tests-positive-for-covid-19/ar-BB12goRL?ocid=st) — and one that happens to answer my question indirectly. not only was msn relying on the pink news report, msn was literally carrying the pink news report itself: the msn link just serves the pink news article wrapped up in some msn borders. must be an affiliate or some sort of news wire agreement. 

but regardless: pink has since retracted the reporting in this very article in an [updated](https://www.pinknews.co.uk/2020/04/07/israel-health-minister-coronavirus-punishment-homosexuality-positive-covid-19-yaakov-litzman/) version (same reporter as article carried by msn); msn just has not updated its version to reflect the retraction.

It didn't mention it in the initial report, but it looks like it might be a Japanese full-length album! Hmm..

Note: The drama was postponed due to Coronavirus (fuckin up filming schedules and all), meaning the first broadcast with the OST (theme song) will also be delayed.

> **BTS, new album in Japan after 1 year... ""showing off their box office power again""**

> **Releasing in July including ON Japanese version and others, city tour also planned... Due to variables because of Corona local broadcasters are releasing BTS content. Looking forward to new records after last summer's box office hit**

> Global group BTS will conquer Japan this summer.

> After the release of their 4th full length album ""Map of the Soul: 7"" in February, the group who has been conquering the world will release a new Japanese album in July. At the same time, they will tour each city on their world tour beginning with Fukuoka. Although the prospects may be changed due to the spread of the Coronavirus, BTS' will to carry out their activities remains firm.

> The new Japanese album to be released by BTS follows one year after their 10th single ""Lights/Boy With Luv"" released on July 3rd. At the time the group gained over 1 million sales in preorders alone, drawing attention. BTS was the first Korean artist to surpass 1 million sales in Japan. They are expected to have another opportunity to reclaim their box office power with this album as well.

> This album, including a new song (t/n or songs... doesn't specify), includes the Japanese version of their 4th full-length album's title track ""ON"" as well as TVTokyo drama ""Spiral Labyrinth - DNA Science Investigation"" OST ""Stay Gold"" as side tracks. BTS is currently carrying this plan out without setbacks.

> Recently local broadcasters have been releasing various content regarding BTS and are gaining new confidence. Last month TBS showed the group's fanmeeting at Osaka Kyocera Dome live in December 2019. They are also planned to broadcast BTS' movie ""Burn The Stage: The Movie"" on the 25th.

> BTS will hold a stadium tour in Japan starting from July 28th at the PayPay Dome in Fukuoka, then the Kyocera Dome in Osaka in July, Saitama in August, Tokyo in September, etc. However, there are many observations needed to be looked over in order to safely hold the tour concert as scheduled.

> Currently Japan has been experiencing a large increase in Coronavirus infections. On the 6th alone, 230 cases were added and as of the 7th, NHK's total Coronavirus confirmed cases are almost at 5000 people. In response, Japan's Prime Minister Shinzo Abe declared a state of emergency for 7 prefectures including Tokyo.

> According to this, BTS' company Big Hit Entertainment will watch over the spread of COVID-19 until the end of May to adjust the world tour schedule accordingly. Earlier, their Seoul concert was cancelled and their scheduled North American tour was also postponed.

Basically, I took a sick day last week because I was feeling a little under the weather (just a combo of that time of the month, hayfever, stress and needing a mental health day.) From the beginning I made sure to tell my boss I had nothing resembling coronavirus so that no one would be worried. My boss then texted me a number of times about it over the weekend. Thinking he was just being considerate, I told him I was feeling a bit blah (which was true), but also assured him I had no cough, fever, shortness of breath, etc.

I've since found out from a colleague that around a month ago, my boss had been secretly nursing what he believed to be coronavirus symptoms and came into work the whole time without a mask. So, no matter how much I insist I'm not sick, he has convinced himself he has infected me. Not only that, he's told the whole office that I am infected. Now, a coworker has told his hospital-working girlfriend, who is insisting I be tested because I guess my non-existent illness has put her at risk? 

I don't have any relevant symptoms and am 100% sure I will not qualify for a test, but I've been instructed by the boss to contact a consultation line. I've tried a number this morning just to try to put this to bed, but they're all busy. While I would happily take a test to end this, if even legitimately sick people can't get tested, victims of office hysteria have no chance. I legitimately am dumbfounded by how stupid this is.

The other thing we need to ask about DP is what portion of the ""herd"" of passengers was already bringing some sort of immunity to the party.  Not necessarily that they had already been infected, but also that perhaps there is some cross-immunity or innate resistance to catching it.

For instance, I'm still not sure if young people are simply not dying from this because they brush it off so easily or if they truly cannot get the bug (in any significant numbers) in the first place.  That's a shockingly unresolved question even at this late stage.

Global death rates for individuals without a pre existing condition is ~1%. 

That is in western, fully supported and stocked hospitals with plenty of support, enough beds, supplies, etc etc. even in Italy or Spain where they ran out of beds, they prioritized the young and healthy to give their limited resources best chance to save more people. 

5000 people living on a single vessel suck at sea, with a virus 3 to 4 times more infectious than the flu, with a doubling rate on board that was screaming up past the less that half day time period would have left the medical staff completely unable to cope. 

Now, fuckweasel, we have circa 4500 infected sailors with super limited bedspace. In GOOD circumstances (proper hospitals) 1% of young healthy adults will die. That ship, those resources is far from good. But even taking that base figure, (not taking into account viral loading, which I told you to google and is why we’re seeing a disproportionality high level of healthcare workers being ICU’d because of this) we’re looking at 50 healthy young adults dying, *for literally no reason* and if you think that acceptable or fair, then you can get fucked as a reprehensible piece of shit.

As insurance companies get new data and submit rate filings with this most recent data (lower accident frequency, etc) you may see premiums decrease.

However, keep in mind that they don't want to overreact to this situation and significantly decrease rates. If they push significant rate decreases and we get back on the roads all at once in say six months, you'll see them running into issues with their combined ratios as accidents spike back up to pre-coronavirus levels. There's a lot at play here and it'll be interesting to see how each insurer responds.

Also, most auto premiums aren't rated on miles driven, at least not significantly. Mileage is a poor exposure base for auto insurance, since people can lie about it. It probably is incorporated as a minor rating factor, but don't expect to see your premium cut in half if you drive half as much, or even stop altogether."

> Question: You’d mentioned in your last press conference that the doubling time in Colorado for new coronavirus cases is going down. How can we have confidence in those numbers if, by your own admission, there are thousands or tens of thousands of people in Colorado who have the virus who we don’t even know about?

> Answer: **We see the number of beds we’re using every day.** The frustrating part is that’s a trailing indicator — usually four or five days to exposure and then often another seven or eight days to hospitalization. We need to track that, and we need to grow for that, because that’s the pinch point. It’s not how many people have the virus, or have had it. It’s about who needs a bed now, at any given time, who needs a bed in a week, in two weeks, who needs a ventilator, who needs oxygen, who the caregivers are.



so, they are using hospitalization statistics.  If you believe that certain percent of the infected would require hospitalization - you can track the rate of doubling by looking at the number of hospitalizations."

My first night out will probably be for my “birthday” and I would like to think I can wear a crop top, skirt, and some cute lil jewelry. However, this quarantine has me missing my gym routine and def putting on some weight, so I’m thinking I might skip the crop top lol.

I’m also in a student teaching program and my practicing was interrupted by the lockdown since public schools are closed in my area, so my first business outfit will be my new tan tapered pants I bought just before spring break, a nice black blouse, and some chunky black heels. And whatever necklace I match (I’m still learning how to match jewelry).

My current wardrobe has been a rotation between 3 pairs of sweatpants, 2 pairs of leggings, and a variety of oversized sweatshirts and t shirts. Hair hasn’t been done in a month and I haven’t had any makeup on either. Skin is loving it!!

I don't know, it's a difficult question. But some profs are essentially relying on the honor system, because there isn't really a good alternative - the infrastructure simply doesn't exist. Many of them are putting in a lot of work behind the scenes to keep their classes going, and are trusting you to do your part and not cheat, because the alternative is to put your education on hold until this is all over. And what are you contemplating doing? Abusing this trust and cheating the system, which not only undermines your education, but is also unfair to all of your peers who *don't* cheat.

It was supposed to be put into buffers, before the economy starts totally tanking. These goons are dumping it all into the stock market. The problem is the fundamentals aren't there, so as soon as the artificial ballooning has petered out, it is going to go into a nosedive.  
   
Such unbelievable times. The Konservative Republicans always like to tout how they are 'fiscally responsible'. The National Debt was $1 Trillion last year, and for FY20, before the pandemic, was supposed to be $1.3 Trillion. Now, it appears $6 Trillion has been added to that. In addition, the National Debt ceiling, was approaching $23 Trillion and needed to be raised to $25 Trillion to get into next year FY21. The Congress went ahead and removed the concept of a debt ceiling last year. Right now, the National Debt is about $29 Trillion. That means every American man, woman, child independently is in debt about $83,000 to pay off their share.  
  
The ballooning of the National Debt was due to the Republican tax 'cut' bill passed in FY18, resulting in $1 Trillion less revenue from the wealthy and corporations. Now, not only did they get their taxes cut to almost zero, they are going to be getting trillions in grants and loans.

> Mr Harris announced he would activate the regulations following a meeting with the Garda Commissioner and the Attorney General on Tuesday. It is understood signing of the regulations had been delayed as the Government’s lawyers worked out the precise wording and extent of the powers.

> Gardaí will now have the power to arrest and detain those who breach the restrictions. This includes those found exercising beyond 2km from their homes or those travelling for non-essential reasons. 

> Convictions will result in a maximum sentence of six months in prison and a fine of €2,500. 

> Gardaí will also have the power to assist the HSE in detaining someone judged to be at risk of spreading the virus who refuses to self isolate. Those refusing to comply with such orders face up to three months in prison.

> The measures were to be enacted on Tuesday amid worries the fine weather will attract many people to public spaces over the coming bank holiday weekend.

2020-04-07,Ceeeceeeceee,newjersey,7,https://www.reddit.com/r/newjersey/comments/fwudl1/100_n95s_donated_to_area_hospitals_from_my/fmqgkws/,"I’m a retired doctor with an autoimmune disease.   I teach basic and medical English online in China.  In January, I watched helplessly as many of my students described this growing epidemic of the novel coronavirus in China, something that wasn’t even on the radar of the average American at the time.  Two young students even fell ill, and the rest had their lives drastically changed overnight.  As someone who regularly talks to doctors in China, I got a unique glimpse into the uphill battle they fought for months over this—both the infection and subsequent cover-up.  However, because of the strict social restrictions in China, this was brought under control there and businesses and schools are now reopening (no, I certainly don’t believe the official state numbers, but I’m certain it’s much more controlled there than it is here, mostly because I’ve seen it with my own eyes).

It was then that my students started offering me their facemasks and personal protective equipment.  At first I said no; I can manage my own risk through social distancing, hygiene and a handmade mask, thank you.  Then one day, I saw some messages from the daughter of a 60 yo nurse at an area hospital.  She was really scared her mother would die.  The hospital (a major teaching hospital you all know of) only had one week of PPE supplies—employees risked getting fired if they spoke of it.  Nurses have been baking n95 masks in home ovens to sterilize them (risking the seals).  They were wearing homemade masks and garbage bags over scrubs.  It was then that I decided to take action and start accepting PPE donations from my Chinese students—from the seasoned ophthalmologist at a tertiary center in Beijing to the pleas of a 6yo nurse’s son, hoping I can help save some people with his extra safety glasses and surgical masks.  Yes, all sealed, mostly 3M manufactured CDC approved (same as hospital suppliers buy).  In all, I have been able to collect and donate over 100 precious n95 masks, which are backordered by many months in the US.

I post this not to brag but to show that the Chinese people are not to be equated with their government.  These are just private citizens, many healthcare professionals that risk their lives for a fraction of the salaries American doctors and nurses make.  They have the biggest hearts of anyone I know.  They do not care for politics or cultural differences.  When they heard their brothers and sisters in healthcare were lacking equipment while waging war with the same virus that killed many of their countrymen, they did not hesitate to start mailing their supplies.

I posted about this in a FB group for “healthcare professionals” and got thousands of likes and 95% positive comments, but even there, I received a few that disgusted me:  “Their bat-eating people started this, this is the least they could do.”; “China kills babies, they don’t care about lives.”; “Sure, send us your coronavirus covered leftovers”; “Make sure you wash that sht off”.  Made me want to stop my efforts, knowing some PPE would go towards racist, ungrateful people like this.

I am Chinese-American myself—born in China, raised in America.  I served in the US Army as a family doctor for years (that’s me in camo standing in front of a helicopter).  Yet today, I have to worry not only about keeping my parents safe from the virus, but about random racists screaming sh*t at my mom as she walks her dog.   Please stand up to racism when you see it because it breeds in silence and complacency.

People who look like me fought side by side with US troops in Afghanistan.  People who look like me sacrificed to get your hospital supplies.  People who look like me had nothing to do with the spread of COVID19 and were just as much victims as people in your city.  People who look like me were lied to by governments on both sides of the Pacific, and we citizens do not want to be confused with our governments.  People who look like me have never eaten bat or dog, or whatever the tin foil hat video of the week is.  People who look like me don’t deserve to be spit on or kicked in the street.  My ethnicity is not a virus."

The Federal Emergency Management Agency is not publicly reporting the acquisitions, despite the outlay of millions of dollars of taxpayer money, nor has the administration detailed how it decides which supplies to seize and where to reroute them.
>
>>Officials who’ve had materials seized also say they’ve received no guidance from the government about how or if they will get access to the supplies they ordered. That has stoked concerns about how public funds are being spent and whether the Trump administration is fairly distributing scarce medical supplies.

>>But the agency has refused to provide any details about how these determinations are made or why it is choosing to seize some supply orders and not others. Administration officials also will not say what supplies are going to what states.
>
>>Using the Defense Production Act, a Korean War-era law that allows the president to compel the production of vital equipment in a national emergency, Trump last month ordered General Motors to produce ventilators to address shortfalls at hospitals.
>
>>The law also empowers federal agencies to place orders for critical materials and to see that those get priority over orders from private companies or state and local governments.

>
>>Jose Camacho, who heads the Texas Assn. of Community Health Centers, said his group was trying to purchase a small order of just 20,000 masks when his supplier reported that the order had been taken.
>
>>Camacho was flabbergasted. Several of his member clinics — which as primary care centers are supposed to alleviate pressure on overburdened hospitals — are struggling to stay open amid woeful shortages of protective equipment

>>“Everyone says you are supposed to be on your own,” Camacho said, noting Trump's repeated admonition that states and local health systems cannot rely on Washington for supplies. “Then to have this happen, you just sit there wondering what else you can do. You can’t fight the federal government.”

The frequency given out by the 5G towers and amplifiers uses millimeter wave technology bands to transmit data in the frequency range of 24–86 GHz. Research has shown that different frequencies resonate with different molecules in the air. For example, 2.4GHZ (the frequency used by microwaves and most household appliances) reacts with the hydrogen in water molecules and causes the electrons to spin, which in turn causes the water molecules to heat up, hence why the food gets warm.

The next frequency up is 60GHZ which happens to react in a similar way with oxygen. There has been much research to show that the specific frequency of 60GHZ resonates way more with oxygen than any other frequency in the spectrum. What this means is that when the 5G towers emit this frequency it will be able to alter/absorb the oxygen in the AIR. This is why trees near these towers have been cut down and even bees and birds die all around them. And you'll never guess which organ in the human body this will impact the most? Yep, the lungs (and consequentially the heart). If you happen to be near one of these 5G towers when they are emitting the 60GHZ frequency, you may find yourself short of breath and if exposed for long enough at a high enough intensity you will eventually experience worsening symptoms and possibly go unconscious/have a heart attack especially if you have any underlying respiratory or heart conditions. The way 60GHZ reacts with oxygen is this: as you probably know Oxygen is O2, which means the oxygen atoms share two electrons through covalent bonding. Once 60GHZ interacts with oxygen them two electrons begin to spin. This means that when we breathe in and the oxygen enters the bloodstream, they fail to bond to the hemoglobin in our blood (due to the electrons spinning) which is crucial for us to be able to absorb oxygen. Therefore we essentially won't be able to BREATHE since we cannot uptake the oxygen which is vital to support our muscle, heart and brain function.

It's also worth noting there are only set bands of frequencies that are 'unlicensed' that manufacturers of electronic products are allowed to use. This rule was first introduced with AM and FM radios to prevent the use of varying frequencies interrupting other signals.

But don't take my word for it, here is some further research I've done for you to hear this from some more qualified people:

While you can certainly make the case that some of those that have died may not have done so directly because of coronavirus, it's not as black and white as a cause of death right now.  You have a critical shortage of staff and equipment. These people are being overworked well beyond what is normal or safe.  The influx of these patients strains the system such that Susie with the basic flu who might otherwise have made it with more attention and dedicated monitoring, has now died because other coronavirus patients were occupying the available staff.  That person who got a staph infection because of all the constant reuse of PPE is something that might otherwise have been prevented were it not for the unique circumstances of this pandemic.  That person who died of pneumonia because a ventilator went to a Covid patient instead. These are all deaths from other medical ailments, to be sure, but are still counted against the totals because they were directly influenced negatively by the covid-19 pandemic.  This is a common practice and not unique to this situation."

For those who don't want to pause their Ad-Blocker, here are the big take-aways.

""For 10 patients severely ill with the new coronavirus, a single dose of antibodies drawn from the blood of people who had recovered from COVID-19 appeared to save lives, shorten the duration of symptoms, improve oxygen levels and speed up viral clearance, newly published research reports. 

\[...\]

In all ten patients, the symptoms that had driven them to seek emergency care had either disappeared or largely improved within one to three days of their receiving a transfusion of antibodies from a recovered donor. Two of the three patients who had been breathing with the help of a mechanical ventilator were able to step down to oxygen delivered into the nose.

None of the 10 patients died, and only one unexpected side effect — a red bruise on one patient’s face — was detected.

Of those who received convalescent plasma, three were discharged from the hospital, and the remaining seven were rated “much improved” and ready for discharge.

“This pilot study on \[convalescent plasma\] therapy shows a potential therapeutic effect and low risk in the treatment of severe COVID-19 patients,” the authors of the new research wrote. “One dose of \[convalescent plasma\] with a high concentration of neutralizing antibodies can rapidly reduce the viral load and tends to improve clinical outcomes,” they added.

The authors, led by [Kai Duan](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?cmd=search&term=Yu+J%5Bau%5D&dispmax=50) of China’s National Biotec Group Co. Ltd., said that only larger and more detailed studies will clarify the dose at which convalescent plasma produces the most healing effects, and when it should ideally be administered.

It's ""far right"" to, *once it has a different name that everyone is already using* try to *rebrand* the virus to highlight it's place of origin, when that place has already had high tensions with the US due to a trade war, after hate crimes on people who ""look Chinese"" have increased due to the fear and anxiety surrounding that virus. 

This goes double for calling it the ""CCP virus"". Like, what? If the virus originated in the US and people internationally called it the ""Republican party virus"" that would be grounds for weird conspiracy bullshit on the right, even *if it was because of deregulations they implemented*! Naming a virus after the Communist Party of China is so insane to me, like, do you just *want* to piss off the planet's workshop? 

If it had just been ""the Wuhan virus"" the whole time... Whatever. An incident of history with some negative consequences. But it was SARS-COVID-2/Covid-19/Coronavirus already. We had *sidestepped* the potential ""adding tensions to interactions with China in a situation where we 110% need to work together to save everyone"" situation. 

Everyone who knows anything about this virus knows its first cases happened in Wuhan. It's not about providing good information in the name. It's about constantly reminding (xenophobic and proto-xenophobic) people that this virus came from *that place* that was *bad* and we should *blame them*. Which is ridiculously unhelpful in a global pandemic. 

Maybe, when the dust settles, it would be a good idea for the WHO to do an investigation Chinese wet markets and their political influence that keeps getting them unbanned after they ban them. But right now, division is not what is needed, and this emphasis on calling it a ""Chinese"" or ""Wuhan"" virus when it was already just being called other things (much like the SARS outbreak was called SARS and not ""the Chinese SARS"") is just... Unhelpful.

2020-04-07,taike0886,Coronavirus,7,https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/fwl7qs/bill_gates_calls_taiwans_handling_of_coronavirus/fmqsms5/,"Lianghui ( 两会 ) is the most important annual meeting of party and government officials in China. For local officials it is incredibly important to present a good face to central party leaders. While the Beijing Lianghui was canceled due to the virus, many of the provincial meetings were still held, including the one in Wuhan that began on Jan 6 and continued until Jan 18 - two weeks - where there were **no new cases reported** by Wuhan officials. [Here is a rough outline](https://imgur.com/gallery/xr2JCPw).

On Jan 6, the beginning of Lianghui, at least 59 people had a mysterious virus that was described as similar to SARS. By Jan 5th, Hong Kong already had eight suspected cases and had already activated their epidemic response team. South Korea already had one case and had started testing people. Singapore was testing arrivals from Wuhan at the airport. The eight doctors who were accused of spreading rumors about the virus in China had already been hauled up in front of authorities. Doctors treating coronavirus patients in Wuhan hospitals had already started coming down with symptoms, indicating human to human transmission. [On January 5th Wuhan officials released a statement saying there were no medical staff infections and no clear cases of transmission, which was a lie](http://wjw.wuhan.gov.cn/front/web/showDetail/2020010509020).

Through January 18, almost nothing was reported, including the first death. [Hundreds of thousands had already started leaving Wuhan](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/03/22/world/coronavirus-spread.html?action=click&module=Spotlight&pgtype=Homepage). During this time Dr. Li Wenliang's CT scan showed severe opacity in both lungs like ground glass. But Wuhan officials were not reporting anything.

In fact, the utter silence from government officials during Lianghui came along with government efforts to stifle any bad news and bad press on social media and in the news. Doctors were being taken into custody for talking about it. The World Health Organization assisted them and on Jan 8 [told the world](https://www.who.int/china/news/detail/09-01-2020-who-statement-regarding-cluster-of-pneumonia-cases-in-wuhan-china) about China's ""notable achievement"" in identifying the virus, which ""demonstrates China’s increased capacity to manage new outbreaks"" and that there was ""no clear evidence of human-to-human transmission of the novel coronavirus"" - all lies.

At the close of the Lianghui meetings on Jan 18, [a banquet was held by the mayor of Wuhan](https://www.ft.com/content/fa83463a-4737-11ea-aeb3-955839e06441) for **40,000 families** to attend and express their gratitude and patriotism to the PRC. Almost 14,000 individual patriotically-themed dishes were laid out in an attempt to break a world's record. By this time, Japan, Thailand and the United States had already seen their first cases. Many people were infected at this banquet and then left Wuhan and spread the virus across China.

[Scientists were ordered to destroyed proof of what they were witnessing](https://www.straitstimes.com/asia/east-asia/how-early-signs-of-the-coronavirus-were-spotted-spread-and-throttled-in-china) in the critical early weeks, and after the virus had gone from 59 people to now hundreds on Jan 18, now spreading to the world, after numerous medical personnel who had been caring for virus patients were now showing signs and having to be checked in themselves, China and the WHO worked hand in hand to assure to world that China had it under control.

There was still another week before they sealed off Wuhan. [5 million left before then](https://www.scmp.com/news/china/society/article/3047720/chinese-premier-li-keqiang-head-coronavirus-crisis-team-outbreak). It wasn't until Jan 20 that the head of China’s national health commission team confirmed human-to-human transmission. Weeks after they were seeing it in front of their eyes and not reporting on it.

To recap:

On **Jan 8**, WHO said they said there is ""no evidence"" that the new virus is transmittable and has not been tied to any deaths. On **Jan 22**, while Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus was describing how impressed he was with China’s Minister of Health presentation on the crisis, WHO field workers issued a statement that ""[deployment of the new test kit nationally suggests that human-to-human transmission is taking place in Wuhan](https://www.who.int/china/news/detail/22-01-2020-field-visit-wuhan-china-jan-2020)."" They didn't even know, they were just assuming based on Chinese health officials' actions. Finally, on **Jan 30**, WHO [declared the virus a global health emergency](https://www.statnews.com/2020/01/30/who-declares-coronavirus-outbreak-a-global-health-emergency/), but not without a whole host of caveats -  ""This is the time for solidarity, not stigma,"" **urging countries not to restrict travel or trade to China**, and stressing that the decision was not meant to criticize the Chinese response to the outbreak, which the WHO never once did throughout this crisis - they only offered praise.

Why would WHO say these things and behave this way? Why did so many nations go against WHO's recommendations and act much faster than they did in responding to the crisis, saving probably hundreds if not thousands of lives? Why was the WHO so slow with critical, life-saving information and clear recommendations?

WHO was lied to, chances are that they knew they were being lied to, and they chose to carry China's lies to the world. Taiwan and South Korea sent observers to Wuhan and on Jan 20 they activated the Central Epidemic Command Center and began working on a strategy. The rest of the world was caught by surprise thanks to China's and the WHO's lies and attempts to downplay the seriousness of the virus."

MOSCOW, April 7. /TASS/. OPEC+ countries are discussing production cuts within the new deal framework from May to the end of July 2020 at the least, two sources in OPEC told TASS on Tuesday.

""Three months. I believe the deal can be made from May because April deliveries have already been scheduled,"" a high-ranking source in the organization said. No clear deadline has been set so far ""but it will be definitely longer than until June,"" another source added.

The OPEC+ oil production reduction deal ended on March 31, 2020. The reason was disagreements between Russia and Saudi Arabia on terms of its extension after March. The withdrawal from the agreement became the cause for production growth in OPEC countries, coupled with the unprecedented demand drop because of the coronavirus pandemic. The oil prices fell to $22 per barrel due to a combination of these factors for the first time in twenty years. The partners decided to resume consultations and involve other producers from G20 countries in joint actions. Negotiations will be held on April 9 in a videoconference format."

I love to pretend that we're all hygenic and awesome out there, but let's be real and honest with ourselves. One perimeter, one party, one sizeable gathering and we pass it around endlessly. 

And, sure, the virus probably wouldn't affect any of us *out there.* But then we all bring it back to our various homes, and depending on where the USA is at with regards to social distancing at that time, we more-than-likely kickstart yet another outbreak of sorts.

Article:
San Bernardino County on Tuesday mandated residents cover their faces when leaving home while also ordering all faith-based services be conducted online as officials ramped up attempts to tamp down the spread of the novel coronavirus.

The formal orders go into effect at midnight and were issued as the county reported a total of 530 confirmed cases of COVID-19, with 16 deaths linked to the virus.

Whenever residents leave home, they must cover their mouth and nose with something that secures to the ears or back of the head, according to a news release from the county. Bandanas and handkerchiefs, neck gaiters and a homemade cloth with ear loop covers were listed as acceptable examples of a face covering.

However, people should avoid using N95 and surgical masks, which are in short supply and desperately needed for health care workers and emergency responders.

Similar orders are in place elsewhere in California, including neighboring Riverside County. Nationally, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has recommended people cover their face when leaving home.

Officials continue to remind the public that facial coverings are an additive preventive measure and not a replacement for strict physical distancing and stay-at-home measures.

“Staying home, practicing social distancing and frequent handwashing are far more effective ways to combat the spread of COVID-19, and face coverings are not a substitute for those practices,” said Dr. Erin Gustafson, the county’s acting public health officer.

With holidays like Easter and Passover coming up, San Bernardino County officials also said that religious services may only be held electronically “through streaming or online technology,” according to the release.

Residents should not leave home for driving parades or drive-up services, officials said. They also can’t go out to pick up pre-packaged Easter eggs, bags filled with candy or toys at a drive-thru location because those items have been deemed nonessential, the release stated.

“We understand that this is an important time for Christians around the world and it is natural to want to worship and celebrate with our families,” Board of Supervisors Chairman Curt Hagrman said. “Right now, however, is a critical time for our country and our community – we can still celebrate this time from the safety of our individual homes while we help flatten the curve and save lives.”

Home-based worshipping and activities such as Easter egg hunts are encouraged by the county, but should be limited to immediate household members inside a home or in a residential backyard, according to the release.

Those who violate the order could face a fine of up to $1,000 or as many as 90 days imprisonment, or both, officials warned.

The full order can be viewed here."

The situation with the medical supplies is a lot like the situation with toilet paper. There's plenty to go around, except that everyone wants to stash up causing some people to have more than they need and others to have none. The white house has said that some states are requesting 10x what they need based on models that [have since proven inaccurate](https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2020/04/06/americas-most-influential-coronavirus-model-just-revised-its-estimates-downward-not-every-model-agrees/). Colorado requested 5 million masks, Pennsylvania requested 2 million. Colorado has half as many people as Penn, yet they requested twice as much equipment. Colorado is a blue state. Penn is red.

One more thing: I get that everyone wants to blame the president when things are bad, but the president isn't micromanaging every little decision. The president isn't unilaterally deciding which states get what. Trump has advisors who have advisors who have committees that decide these things. By the same token, state governors are not elected based on their ability to estimate statewide healthcare needs. Cuomo doesn't know how many masks they're going to need.

The president of the European Research Council — the EU’s top scientist — has resigned after failing to persuade Brussels to set up a large-scale scientific programme to fight Covid-19.

Professor Mauro Ferrari, who started a four-year term as leader of Europe’s flagship scientific institution on January 1, submitted his resignation to EU commission president Ursula von der Leyen on Tuesday afternoon.

“I have been extremely disappointed by the European response to Covid-19,” he said in a statement to the Financial Times. “I arrived at the ERC a fervent supporter of the EU [but] the Covid-19 crisis completely changed my views, though the ideals of international collaboration I continue to support with enthusiasm.”

The ERC, set up in 2007 to fund Europe’s best scientists, has become one of the world’s most prestigious funding agencies with a budget of around €2bn a year.

Prof Ferrari, an Italian-American pioneer of nanomedicine, said his rift with the European Commission started in early March “as it became evident that the pandemic would be a tragedy of possibly unprecedented proportions”.

He said he proposed then to set up a special ERC programme to combat Covid-19. “I thought that at a time like this, the very best scientists in the world should be provided with resources and opportunities to fight the pandemic, with new drugs, new vaccines, new diagnostic tools, new behavioural dynamic approaches based on science, to replace the oft-improvised intuitions of political leaders,” he said.

But the ERC Scientific Council, its governing body, unanimously rejected the idea, he said, on the grounds that its remit allows it only to fund “bottom-up” research proposed by scientists, rather than larger “top-down” programmes with objectives set by EU leaders.

“I argued that this was not the time for scientific governance to worry excessively about the subtleties of the distinctions between bottom-up versus top-down research,” said Prof Ferrari, who spent much of his career as a prominent cancer researcher in the US.

He said he got a second chance when Ms von der Leyen asked him for his views on addressing the pandemic. He then developed a plan “to which she contributed substantial directives”.

“The very fact that I worked directly with her created an internal political thunderstorm,” he said. “The proposal was passed on to different layers of European Commission administration, where I believe it disintegrated upon impact.”

The commission confirmed that Prof Ferrari had stepped down but did not respond to a request for further comment.

Prof Ferrari lamented “the complete absence of co-ordination of healthcare policies among member states, the recurrent opposition to cohesive financial support initiatives, the pervasive one-sided border closures” in the EU.

The pandemic has stoked tensions within the bloc and led to criticism that some EU countries have failed to co-operate or show solidarity with those hit hardest by coronavirus.

Janez Lenarcic, the EU’s crisis management commissioner, said on Tuesday that member states had initially not offered the help needed by Italy as the death toll there soared.

“There was an inadequate response to the Italian request for assistance from other EU member states,” he told reporters in Brussels on Tuesday, as he unveiled a plan to dispatch doctors and nurses from Romania and Norway to Italy. “But things have changed now.”

With the commission’s agreement, Prof Ferrari remained a part-time affiliate professor at the University of Washington School of Pharmacy in Seattle after he became ERC president. He plans now to set up an international research initiative to fight Covid-19 from the US."

Tips For Social Distancing, Quarantine, And Isolation During An Infectious Disease Outbreak

What Is Social Distancing?

Social distancing is a way to keep people from interacting closely or frequently enough to spread an infectious disease. Schools and other gathering places such as movie theaters may close, and sports events and religious services may be cancelled.

What Is Quarantine?

Quarantine separates and restricts the movement of people who have been exposed to a contagious disease to see if they become sick. It lasts long enough to ensure the person has not contracted an infectious disease.

What Is Isolation?

Isolation prevents the spread of an infectious disease by separating people who are sick from those who are not. It lasts as long as the disease is contagious.

What To Expect: Typical Reactions

Everyone reacts differently to stressful situations such as an infectious disease outbreak that requires social distancing, quarantine, or isolation. People may feel:

•	⁠Anxiety, worry, or fear related to:
•	⁠Your own health status
•	⁠The health status of others whom you may have exposed to the disease
•	⁠The resentment that your friends and family may feel if they need to go into quarantine as a result of contact with you
•	⁠The experience of monitoring yourself, or being monitored by others for signs and symptoms of the disease
•	⁠Time taken off from work and the potential loss of income and job security
•	⁠The challenges of securing things you need, such as groceries and personal care items
•	⁠Concern about being able to effectively care for children or others in your care
•	⁠Uncertainty or frustration about how long you will need to remain in this situation, and uncertainty about the future
•	⁠Loneliness associated with feeling cut off from the world and from loved ones
•	⁠Anger if you think you were exposed to the disease because of others’ negligence
•	⁠Boredom and frustration because you may not be able to work or engage in regular day-to-day activities
•	⁠Uncertainty or ambivalence about the situation
•	⁠A desire to use alcohol or drugs to cope
•	⁠Symptoms of depression, such as feelings of hopelessness, changes in appetite, or sleeping too little or too much
•	⁠Symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), such as intrusive distressing memories, flashbacks (reliving the event), nightmares, changes in thoughts and mood, and being easily startled.

Ways To Support Yourself During Social Distancing, Quarantine, and Isolation

UNDERSTAND THE RISK

Consider the real risk of harm to yourself and others around you. The public perception of risk during a situation such as an infectious disease outbreak is often inaccurate. Media coverage may create the impression that people are in immediate danger when really the risk for infection may be very low. Take steps to get the facts:

•	⁠Stay up to date on what is happening, while limiting your media exposure. Avoid watching or listening to news reports 24/7 since this tends to increase anxiety and worry. Remember that children are especially affected by what they hear and see on television.
•	⁠Look to credible sources for information on the infectious disease outbreak.

BE YOUR OWN ADVOCATE

Speaking out about your needs is particularly important if you are in quarantine, since you may not be in a hospital or other facility where your basic needs are met. Ensure you have what you need to feel safe, secure, and comfortable.

•	⁠Work with local, state, or national health officials to find out how you can arrange for groceries and toiletries to be delivered to your home as needed.
•	⁠Inform health care providers or health authorities of any needed medications and work with them to ensure that you continue to receive those medications.

EDUCATE YOURSELF

Health care providers and health authorities should provide information on the disease, its diagnosis, and treatment.

•	⁠Do not be afraid to ask questions—clear communication with a health care provider may help reduce any distress associated with social distancing, quarantine, or isolation.
•	⁠Ask for written information when available.
•	⁠Ask a family member or friend to obtain information in the event that you are unable to secure this information on your own.

WORK WITH YOUR EMPLOYER TO REDUCE FINANCIAL STRESS

If you’re unable to work during this time, you may experience stress related to your job status or financial situation.

•	⁠Provide your employer with a clear explanation of why you are away from work.
•	⁠Contact the U.S. Department of Labor tollfree at 1-866-487-2365 about the Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA), which allows U.S. employees up to 12 weeks of unpaid leave for serious medical conditions, or to care for a family member with a serious medical condition.
•	⁠Contact your utility providers, cable and Internet provider, and other companies from whom you get monthly bills to explain your situation and request alternative bill payment arrangements as needed.

CONNECT WITH OTHERS

Reaching out to people you trust is one of the best ways to reduce anxiety, depression, loneliness, and boredom during social distancing, quarantine, and isolation. You can:

•	⁠Use the telephone, email, text messaging, and social media to connect with friends, family, and others.
•	⁠Talk “face to face” with friends and loved ones using Skype or FaceTime.
•	⁠If approved by health authorities and your health care providers, arrange for your friends and loved ones to bring you newspapers, movies, and books.
•	⁠Sign up for emergency alerts via text or email to ensure you get updates as soon as they are available.
•	⁠Call SAMHSA’s free 24-hour Disaster Distress Helpline at 1-800-985-5990, if you feel lonely or need support.
•	⁠Use the Internet, radio, and television to keep up with local, national, and world events.
•	⁠If you need to connect with someone because of an ongoing alcohol or drug problem, consider calling your local Alcoholics Anonymous or Narcotics Anonymous offices.

TALK TO YOUR DOCTOR

If you are in a medical facility, you may have access to health care providers who can answer your questions. However, if you are quarantined at home, and you’re worried about physical symptoms you or your loved ones may be experiencing, call your doctor or other health care provider:

•	⁠Ask your provider whether it would be possible to schedule remote appointments via Skype or FaceTime for mental health, substance use, or physical health needs.

USE PRACTICAL WAYS TO COPE AND RELAX

•	⁠Relax your body often by doing things that work for you-take deep breaths, stretch, meditate or pray, or engage in activities you enjoy.
•	⁠Pace yourself between stressful activities, and do something fun after a hard task.
•	⁠Talk about your experiences and feelings to loved ones and friends, if you find it helpful.
•	⁠Maintain a sense of hope and positive thinking; consider keeping a journal where you write down things you are grateful for or that are going well

* Special Inspector General for Pandemic Recovery, Department of the Treasury.  

* five-member congressional commission that will be appointed by leaders of the House and Senate.  Since we have a D-House and an R-Senate, this 5-person committee should be bipartisan.

Had China been completely transparent, we would’ve understood the gravity of the situation much sooner. It wasn’t until early March that we realized this wasn’t just another swine flu situation. I just barely accepted that myself. It’s hard to make proper decisions for 350 million people when you lack *seriously critical* information. 


Another point to make is that each individual state and county are capable of making decisions. They can shut down their air ports, place travel bans, shut down businesses, etc. They don’t need trumps approval. But they didn’t do that. Why? Because they were working off the same info as trump. And that was shit garbage info from the fucking bullshit government that is China. Like fucking Bloomberg whining and crying that trump won’t do more to help his own home state. Motherfucker it’s your state, make some goddamn decisions yourself. Trump isn’t any more obligated to NY than he is the whole country. 


Then let’s talk about the ridiculousness that is Congress. The left and the right combined had their heads up their damn asses when it came to passing coronavirus related bills. That isn’t trumps fault in the slightest. We should’ve already seen a stim package hit our accounts and the economy should’ve already seen an uptick. But we’re so far behind because the idiots couldn’t pass a simple bill without stuffing their high roller constituents bullshit In the bill. 


And lastly, while we have the highest over all number of cases (although I’m sure chinas Lyin asses are way worse off), we don’t have the worst infection or death rates. Our infection rates and death rates based on population size are significantly lower than that of Spain and Italy. Other than a just a couple highly dense hot spots like NYC, most of the country is not that bad off at all. 


So yeah, trump certainly fucked up. But let’s not pretend that he’s the only one to blame, or that he’s even carrying the heaviest burden of blame. Trump, both side of congress, governors, mayors, all of China, etc. all hold a significant hand of blame in Americas current condition."

On March 30, President Donald Trump went onto the most important news venue in America, Fox & Friends, to defend his handling of the coronavirus outbreak. Here is a thing he said:

""Nobody could have predicted something like this . . .""

This is false.

In 2005, President George W. Bush was reading a book—this is a thing presidents used to do, because books often contain useful information. The book was John Barry's history of the 1918 influenza. (If you remember, we talked about it a couple weeks ago.) The book spurred Bush to start poking around to see if the country was ready to handle another pandemic.

From the ABC News report:
 

>[H]e called his top homeland security adviser into the Oval Office and gave her the galley of historian John M. Barry's ""The Great Influenza,"" which told the chilling tale of the mysterious plague that ""would kill more people than the outbreak of any other disease in human history.""
""You've got to read this,"" Fran Townsend remembers the president telling her. ""He said, 'Look, this happens every 100 years. We need a national strategy.'"" . . .

>When Bush first told his aides he wanted to focus on the potential of a global pandemic, many of them harbored doubts.

>""My reaction was -- I'm buried. I'm dealing with counterterrorism. Hurricane season. Wildfires. I'm like, 'What?'"" Townsend said. ""He said to me, 'It may not happen on our watch, but the nation needs the plan.'"" . . .
According to Bossert, who is now an ABC News contributor, Bush did not just insist on preparation for a pandemic. He was obsessed with it.
""He was completely taken by the reality that that was going to happen,"" Bossert said. . . .

>In a November 2005 speech at the National Institutes of Health, Bush laid out proposals in granular detail -- describing with stunning prescience how a pandemic in the United States would unfold. Among those in the audience was Dr. Anthony Fauci, the leader of the current crisis response, who was then and still is now the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases.
""A pandemic is a lot like a forest fire,"" Bush said at the time. ""If caught early it might be extinguished with limited damage. If allowed to smolder, undetected, it can grow to an inferno that can spread quickly beyond our ability to control it."" . . .

>""To respond to a pandemic, we need medical personnel and adequate supplies of equipment,"" Bush said. ""In a pandemic, everything from syringes to hospital beds, respirators masks and protective equipment would be in short supply.""
Bush told the gathered scientists that they would need to develop a vaccine in record time.
""If a pandemic strikes, our country must have a surge capacity in place that will allow us to bring a new vaccine on line quickly and manufacture enough to immunize every American against the pandemic strain,"" he said.


That was the Bush administration. And please keep in mind that all of this energy came directly from President Bush himself, who saw the dangers when others did not, who raised the alarm all on his own, and who then rode herd over the army of officials and bureaucrats in the executive branch.

The Obama administration created an actual playbook for dealing with a pandemic—the 69 page document is literally called a ""playbook""—which they handed off to the Trump administration in 2017.
So it is literally true that the only president in the last 20 years who did not predict that something like this could happen is Donald J. Trump.

I know what you're thinking: He's only the leader of the free world. How could he be expected to read a book, or study the history of his immediate predecessors? There are only so many hours in the day and he needs to prioritize time for the essential tasks of the office, like Twitter and playing golf.

Except that last night Axios got hold of memos written by one of Trump's top advisors, Peter Navarro, raising the alarm on the novel coronavirus, warning that it was almost certain to spread to the United States, and pointing out that there were concrete steps Trump needed to take to prepare for the crisis, including banning travel from China—which despite Trump's claims, he never did—and freeing up emergency funding for the stockpiling of protective gear and tests. Which Trump did not do until the virus was in full bloom in America and it was too late. Because the wildfire President Bush warned about had already turned into an inferno.

The first of these memos was sent on January 29.

On January 30, Trump said of the pandemic, ""It's going to have a very good ending for us.""

As of this morning there are 11,000 confirmed COVID-19 deaths in America. "

But what material offers the most protection?
> The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has posted a no-sew mask pattern using a bandanna and a coffee filter as well as a video on making masks using rubber bands and folded fabrics found at home.
> While a simple face covering can reduce the spread of coronavirus by blocking outgoing germs from coughs or sneezes of an infected person, experts say there is more variation in how much homemade masks might protect the wearer from incoming germs, depending on the fit and quality of the material used.
> Scientists around the country have taken it upon themselves to identify everyday materials that do a better job of filtering microscopic particles. In recent tests, HEPA furnace filters scored well, as did vacuum cleaner bags, layers of 600-count pillowcases and fabric similar to flannel pajamas. Stacked coffee filters had medium scores. Scarves and bandanna material had the lowest scores, but still captured a small percentage of particles.
> If you don’t have any of the materials that were tested, a simple light test can help you decide whether a fabric is a good candidate for a mask.
> “Hold it up to a bright light,” said Dr. Scott Segal, chairman of anesthesiology at Wake Forest Baptist Health who recently studied homemade masks. “If light passes really easily through the fibers and you can almost see the fibers, it’s not a good fabric. If it’s a denser weave of thicker material and light doesn’t pass through it as much, that’s the material you want to use.”
> 
> Researchers say it’s important to remember that lab studies are conducted under perfect conditions with no leaks or gaps in the mask, but the test methods give us a way to compare materials. And while the degree of filtration for some homemade masks seems low, most of us — who are staying home and practicing social distancing in public — don’t need the high level of protection required for medical workers. More important, any face covering is better than none, especially if worn by a person who has the virus but doesn’t know it.
> 
> The biggest challenge of choosing a homemade mask material is to find a fabric that is dense enough to capture viral particles, but breathable enough that we can actually wear it. Some items being touted online promise high filtration scores, but the material would be unwearable.
> 
> Yang Wang, an assistant professor of environmental engineering at Missouri University of Science and Technology, worked with his graduate students to study various combinations of layered materials — including both air filters and fabric. “You need something that is efficient for removing particles, but you also need to breathe,” said Dr. Wang, who last fall won an international award for aerosol research.

> To test everyday materials, scientists are using methods similar to those used to test medical masks, which everybody agrees should be saved for medical workers who are exposed to high doses of virus from seeing infected patients. The best medical mask — called the N95 respirator — filters out at least 95 percent of particles as small as 0.3 microns. By comparison, a typical surgical mask — made using a rectangular piece of pleated fabric with elastic ear loops — has a filtration efficiency ranging from 60 to 80 percent.
> 
> Dr. Wang’s group tested two types of air filters. An allergy-reduction HVAC filter worked the best, capturing 89 percent of particles with one layer and 94 percent with two layers. A furnace filter captured 75 percent with two layers, but required six layers to achieve 95 percent. To find a filter similar to those tested, look for a minimum efficiency reporting value (MERV) rating of 12 or higher or a microparticle performance rating of 1900 or higher.
> 
> The problem with air filters is that they potentially could shed small fibers that would be risky to inhale. So if you want to use a filter, you need to sandwich the filter between two layers of cotton fabric. Dr. Wang said one of his grad students made his own mask by following the instructions in the C.D.C. video, but adding several layers of filter material inside a bandanna.
> 
> Dr. Wang’s group also found that when certain common fabrics were used, two layers offered far less protection than four layers. A 600 thread count pillow case captured just 22 percent of particles when doubled, but four layers captured nearly 60 percent. A thick woolen yarn scarf filtered 21 percent of particles in two layers, and 48.8 percent in four layers. A 100 percent cotton bandanna did the worst, capturing only 18.2 percent when doubled, and just 19.5 percent in four layers.
> 
> The group also tested Brew Rite and Natural Brew basket-style coffee filters, which, when stacked in three layers, showed 40 to 50 percent filtration efficiency — but they were less breathable than other options.
> 
> If you are lucky enough to know a quilter, ask them to make you a mask. Tests performed at the Wake Forest Institute for Regenerative Medicine in Winston-Salem, N.C., showed good results for homemade masks using quilting fabric. Dr. Segal, of Wake Forest Baptist Health, who led the study, noted that quilters tend to use high-quality, high-thread count cotton. The best homemade masks in his study were as good as surgical masks or slightly better, testing in the range of 70 to 79 percent filtration. Homemade masks that used flimsier fabric tested as low as 1 percent filtration, Dr. Segal said.
> 
> The best-performing designs were a mask constructed of two layers of high-quality, heavyweight “quilter’s cotton,” a two-layer mask made with thick batik fabric, and a double-layer mask with an inner layer of flannel and outer layer of cotton.
> 
> Bonnie Browning, executive show director for the American Quilter’s Society, said that quilters prefer tightly woven cottons and batik fabrics that stand up over time. Ms. Browning said most sewing machines can handle only two layers of fabric when making a pleated mask, but someone who wanted four layers of protection could wear two masks at a time.
> 
> Ms. Browning said she recently reached out to quilters on Facebook and heard from 71 people who have made a combined total of nearly 15,000 masks. “We quilters are very much in the thick of what’s going on with this,” said Ms. Browning, who lives in Paducah, Ky. “One thing most of us have is a stash of fabric.”

> People who don’t sew could try a folded origami mask, created by Jiangmei Wu, assistant professor of interior design at Indiana University. Ms. Wu, who is known for her breathtaking folded artwork, said she began designing a folded mask out of a medical and building material called Tyvek, as well as vacuum bags, after her brother in Hong Kong, where mask wearing is common, suggested it. The pattern is free online, as is a video demonstrating the folding process. In tests at Missouri University and University of Virginia, scientists found that vacuum bags removed between 60 percent and 87 percent of particles. But some brands of vacuum bags may contain fiberglass or are harder to breathe through than other materials, and shouldn’t be used. Ms. Wu used a bag by EnviroCare Technologies, which has said it does not use fiberglass in its paper and synthetic cloth bags.
> 
> “I wanted to create an alternative for people who don’t sew,” said Ms. Wu, who said she is talking to various groups to find other materials that will be effective in a folded mask. “Given the shortage of all kinds of materials, even vacuum bags might run out.”

While it seems counterintuitive, particles smaller than 0.1 microns are actually easier to catch because they have a lot of random motion that makes them bump into the filter fibers, she said.
> 
> “Even though coronavirus is around 0.1 microns, it floats around in a wide range of sizes, from around 0.2 to several hundred microns, because people shed the virus in respiratory fluid droplets that also contain lots of salts and proteins and other things,” said Dr. Marr. “Even if the water in the droplets fully evaporates, there’s still a lot of salt and proteins and other gunk that stays behind as solid or gel-like material. I think 0.3 microns is still useful for guidance because the minimum filtration efficiency will be somewhere around this size, and it’s what NIOSH uses.”"

A system based on faith requires for life decisions to be based on nothing but trust in sources that have earned no trust. When it comes to Judaism specifically-not only have rabbis earned no trust, they’ve proven themselves to be untrustworthy. The lies, hatred, homophobia, sexism, brainwashing, and more that are systematically forced into the defenseless minds of children is unforgivable. That type of system is inherently broken. Examples ranging from modern orthodox all the way up to Charadim prove this to be true with their arranged marriages, lies about history, and refusals to accept people different from them. However, left wing Judaic systems like Reform and Conservative aren’t guilt-free either. Though they are less strict and don’t particularly care to spread hatred of different groups, they still brainwash their children. The telling of lies to children will hurt them in life. People who base their decisions on faith rather than reason are in for a lot of pain in their lives. Sure, we all experience pain, but people living without reason behind their decisions won’t be able to handle that pain. A great example is prayer. People who believe in prayer are more likely to rely on it than to seek out the best doctors to find cancer treatment, or whatnot. People who “pray the gay away” are certain to find much pain in their lives. More topical-people who have faith that god will save them from the coronavirus are less likely to follow strict quarantine. Furthermore, liberal forms of Judaism can serve as gateways for people to get more radical in their belief. My old  orthodox yeshiva, for example, trained kids specifically in the hope of them becoming more religious later in life. 
In conclusion: while liberal branches of Judaism such as reform and conservative aren’t as awful as fundamental religious branches (and certainly shouldn’t be the focus of attacks on religion), they are still promoting ignorance and lies to children, and creating a family dynamic that pressures the skeptics among them to stay in the community. Therefore, liberal branches of Judaism and religion in general are still bad forms of basis for communities."

New models says COVID-19 deaths have peaked in Washington

4/7/2020
New models, put together by scientists at the U.W., suggest that we could reach the total projected COVID-19 deaths as early as May 10 and the number of projected deaths would drop significantly in our state, but it’s contingent on extended social distancing in our state.

Researchers at UW's School of Medicine says this huge shift in projected deaths, initially from more than 1,600 to 632 has happened for a number of reasons -including social distancing factors taking an effect in our state, plus what the researchers call a “massive infusion of new data’.

Dr. Chris Murray, Director for the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) at the University of Washington's School of Medicine said initial modeling was based mainly on data from Wuhan, China.

""As we obtain more data and more precise data, the forecasts we at IHME created have become more accurate,"" Murray said. ""And these projections are vital to health planners, policymakers, and anyone else associated with caring for those affected by and infected with the coronavirus.""

The actual issue here seems to be buried pretty far down the article:

>*""But many councilmembers expressed concerns that approving these raises could lead to a serious problem down the road as city staff scramble to understand the impact the coronavirus has on local finances.""*

Really, 3-4% raises are something *everybody* should be getting *every year*, given that the average annual rate of inflation in the US is 3.22%. If you have a job and aren't getting yearly raises like that, you're falling behind. Current events have made the timing of this raise controversial. Perhaps you want to argue they're getting paid too much in the first place, but that's a much different conversation.

However, an even bigger issue  (to me) is that so many people don't get raises at all, or get raises less than the rate of inflation – add that to the issue that federal minimum wage today hasn't kept up with cost of living increases and is now worth 31% less than it was in 1968 (although California has taken a big step to change that).

I've started lifting a little too, which may be a touch counter-productive in the weight-loss department, but I really need to strengthen up a bit as my BF% is too damn high.  I need to up my cardiovascular endurance too, as all of my exercise has been long slow walks which have been great for weight loss, but doesn't get the lungs and heart pumping too much.  I actually jogged for about 50 yards yesterday just to see if I could.  I could, but I shouldn't do that just yet as it'll destroy my knees.

I should get my BMI below 40 by mid-May, but that just gets me out of the ""high risk"" BMI as defined by the CDC for coronavirus.  It's not absolute protection (like there is such a thing with this virus)."

this is a myth.

10-20% of drugs are prescribed off-label.  that is, the drug has already been proven safe and effective for SOME treatment, but not necessarily safe and effective for THIS treatment.  as long as there is reasonable medical literature supporting the efficacy, even though it hasn't gone through all the clinicals, a doctor (or in some states with some drugs, a mere pharmacist) can prescribe it.

here, the drug has been approved for anti-malarial treatment for almost a century.  that means it's eligible for off-label prescriptions.  the medical literature at this point certainly supports sufficient efficacy for off-label prescription too.  on top of that, for patients who are terminal without it, trump's right to try law would likely allow that kind of last-ditch experimentation.  yes, there are negative consequences of right to try laws.  in some cases, it will not be effective.  in some cases, it will accelerate the demise of the patient.  but overwhelmingly it will be positive, and 100% of the people who go into those tests are doing so voluntarily and consentually.

it's not financially abusive or coercive either... the drug has been off-patent for almost a century.  there are a dozen companies manufacturing it, and another dozen already certified to manufacture it.  an entire year supply costs less than $100, but you only need 12 doses for the coronavirus treatment.  and that's before you consider insurance.

shit, if you were terminally dying in the ICU of rona, and they asked you do you want to try the experimental drug, or do you want to die, which are you going to pick?"

\---------------------------------------------------  
 I'm the co-founder and CTO at BillionToOne.  I'm happy to answer any questions here. I've also posted a slightly more  technical explanation of how the test works and why it can scale here: [https://twitter.com/dtsao/status/1247642005510873088?s=21](https://twitter.com/dtsao/status/1247642005510873088?s=21)

Edit: Since our site seems to be overwhelmed at the moment, here's a recap:

We’ve  been working hard at BillionToOne on a new COVID-19 test that scales  testing to everyone in the US. Our test (1) re-purposes existing  infrastructure, (2) eliminates time-consuming RNA extraction, and (3)  enables a distributed system for COVID-19 testing.

We need 1  million tests per day to end the stay-at-home orders. Schools are still  open in Iceland because they test 15x more than the US does, per capita ([https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2020/04/02/free-coronav...](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2020/04/02/free-coronavirus-test-anyone-this-country-its-possible/)).

The  first thing we figured out is how to run COVID-19 tests on existing  automated Sanger sequencers. One sequencer can process up to 3840  samples per day. There are hundreds of sequencers of excess capacity  because they were built for the Human Genome Project over 20 years ago.

It  would take only 2 sequencers to surpass the current test capacity for  all of California. There are far more than 2 sequencers in California  (some individual labs have 10 or more).

We tweaked the protocol so  COVID-19 could be detected from sequencing data using machine learning.  Basically, we add \~100 copies of a known DNA sequence to help us  calculate how much virus nucleic acid is in the specimen. It works just  as well as gold-standard RT-qPCR.

Lab workflow for COVID-19  testing is traditionally 1. Specimen accessioning, 2. RNA extraction, 3.  RT-qPCR 4. Reporting. RNA extraction, in particular, has been a huge  bottleneck in terms of reagent shortages and labor-intensiveness.

We showed that we can skip RNA extraction entirely without affecting test sensitivity and limit of detection.

By  skipping RNA extraction and using automated Sanger sequencers, we think  we can get to an additional 200,000 samples per day test capacity in  existing clinical labs.

A distributed system is often the only way  to operate at massive scale. A fully distributed system could have  different sites and labs responsible for each process and dynamically  re-allocate resources based on availability and capacity.

The  Broad institute COVID-19 lab has already started doing this. They are  asking for specimens to be submitted in a standardized tube format and  pre-barcoded. They have essentially distributed the specimen  accessioning work.

Because there is a highly developed service  industry for Sanger sequencing with <24 hour turnaround, there is an  opportunity to further scale up testing by distributing the work to  their (currently) idle sequencers.

Distributed testing could scale  from 200k to >1 million tests per day, but would require a change in  regulations that currently prohibit it.

Thanks to the  BillionToOne team for pulling this work together! Next step is to start  manufacturing test kits and obtain Emergency Use Authorization from the  FDA. We’re eager to work with clinical Lab Directors and contract kit  manufacturers.

I'm way more concerned about the germs my kid left behind while she was leaning out of the cart and grabbing at all the groceries infecting someone else than I am about her getting sick. Even if I was concerned about her getting sick, would I rather go when the store is full of other germy toddlers, or when it is full of mostly adults who generally keep their hands to themselves?

I am the same height and weight as you, but I honestly think it’s a little harder to get the super slender elegant look when we are shorter. It also depends on what your frame is like. If you are skinny fat, you are going to want to look into some of weight training. Since we don’t have access to the gym because of the coronavirus, I suggest looking at body weight fitness subs. Because you are skinny fat, you’re going to want less body fat% and more muscle. You’re going to have to eat at a surplus, and then cut back and lose weight while trying to avoid losing muscle again. It’s a long process and sucks, and it can be complicated. Everyone’s body gains muscle and loses weight differently, so make sure you monitor your progress really closely and see what works best for you. I’m sure you’ve heard this before, but don’t undereat too much. That would just cause more problems outside of trying to achieve your body goal.

I did some research. Due to reporting by this same news agency, they're being investigated currently by the FBI for medicare fraud as well as CSM (Centre for Medicare and Medicaid Services) for violations regarding their transplant department.

Apparently, they kept a patient alive in a vegetative state despite knowing he would likely not recover to make their one year transplant survival rates look better - if he had died they would have fallen below national average and lost a designation. They literally have recordings of an administrator saying the patient needs to be kept alive until the date that the survival report was released, and another saying ""I'm not sure that this is ethical, moral or right, [but it's] for the global good of the future transplant recipients"". They neglected to consult his family about removing him from life support, not informing them of the option at all. They were not even informed his prognosis was that bad. In addition he was in that state due to brain damage during surgery. Two other patients died of brain damage from transplant surgery as well. They were found out of compliance with regulations after CMS discovered that the hospital itself did a review and made recommendations to prevent those things from happening, and then didn't do anything to follow them. Further, another patient had a DNR order, and his family had to fight with staff for a month to follow through with the order. They're now being investigated by the FBI for Medicare fraud regarding these instances. And multiple instances were noted where doctors' treatment decisions were influenced by hospital metrics, as well as instances where they failed to consult the patient or their families. It keeps going. Their response to the CMS declaring them as putting patients in immediate jeopardy was to argue that the regulatory agency doesn't know enough to make these claims. And in January a month later they were still out of compliance. They were going to be reviewed on March 21 one final time and if they were still out of compliance be removed entirely from the Medicare program, but as far as I can tell coronavirus happened and they haven't been inspected yet.

[Patch article with a lot of links to other sources](https://patch.com/new-jersey/newarknj/federal-regulators-newark-beth-israel-put-patients-immediate-jeopardy)

TL;DR: This hospital is garbage, especially transplant department. They are currently under FBI investigation for Medicare fraud for keeping a patient alive to make their transplant survival rate look good. They have repeat violations of regulations as well, including failing to consult patients or disclose treatment options and failing to correct mistakes they identified themselves that led to brain damage and death. They failed to meet compliance and given a hard deadline of March 21 or be removed from the Medicare program, but I believe due to coronavirus they haven't been inspected yet."

""Asthma does not appear to be a strong risk factor for acquiring coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19; SARS-CoV-2), although poorly controlled asthma may lead to a more complicated disease course for those with COVID-19 infection [4]. We concur with expert groups that every effort should be made to avoid COVID-19 exposure and all regular medications necessary to maintain asthma control, including inhaled glucocorticoids, oral glucocorticoids, and biologic agents (eg, omalizumab, mepolizumab), should be continued during the COVID-19 pandemic [2,5,6]. Maintaining good asthma control helps minimize risk of an asthma exacerbation and the associated need for interaction with the healthcare system, which could lead to exposure to COVID-19. There is no good evidence that inhaled glucocorticoids or the biologic agents used for asthma have an adverse effect on the course of COVID-19 infection. For those taking long-term oral glucocorticoids, abruptly stopping this medication can have a number of serious consequences. Furthermore, the usual guidelines for prompt initiation of systemic glucocorticoids for asthma exacerbations should be followed, as delaying therapy can increase the risk of a life-threatening exacerbation. For patients with COVID-19 infection, use of nebulized medications should be avoided, if possible, because of the risk of aerosolizing SARS-CoV-2 and enhancing disease spread. ""

Preliminary results from a study on chloroquine by Fiocruz and the Tropical Medicine Foundation showed that lethality in the group of patients with Covid-19 tested, in severe state, was 13%.

Of 81 inpatients who took the drug, 11 died.



The mortality rate in patients in the same conditions who did not use the drug is 18%, according to international studies, including from China.



The proximity of the two indices does not allow us to state, for the time being, that chloroquine can make a fundamental difference in the treatment of patients infected by the new coronavirus.



""Optimists may think that [the rate of chloroquine use] is lower.  Pessimists may think it is the same.  Statistically, it is the same, at the margin of confidence,"" says infectologist Marcus Lacerda of Fiocruz, who is participating in the study.



The research should therefore follow until the data are conclusive.  ""Anything can.  But we cannot find anything,"" he says, reaffirming that it is necessary to wait for the scientific and reliable conclusions of the study.



He foresees that 440 patients, from different hospitals in the country, will be tested - and it could last from two to three months.  The research group is also integrated by cardiologist Ludhmila Hajjar, of Incor de SP.

The initial idea was for half of the patients to take a 10g dose of chloroquine and the other group, half of that.



The higher dose, however, proved to be toxic, causing unwanted reactions such as arrhythmia and ""other serious complications,"" says Marcus Lacerda.



The preliminary conclusions have already been sent for publication in a scientific journal precisely because the tests showed that the higher dose of chloroquine can cause damage.  And conclusions about patient safety need to be known quickly.



""When we compared the groups of different doses, we saw more toxicity in the high dose.  That's why we suspended this arm of the study,"" says the doctor.  ""Now everyone will use only the low dose.""

""Our study [so far] can only claim that the high dose is very toxic,"" concludes Marcus Lacerda.



The use of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine in patients with coronavirus has become a watchword of President Jair Bolsonaro, who wants to release the use even before the safe conclusion of studies in Brazil and the world.



Health Minister Luiz Mandetta has refused to endorse the widespread use before the scientists' final word."

Like the pandemic is going to spark back up because a parking lot is crowded or you took a walk on the Esplanade.

Think back to our lives 3 weeks ago.  People were crowded into Trimet, cubicles, coffee shops, restaurants, the gym, the library, bars, schools.  The incubation period for Covid is several weeks so at this point all the confirmed cases, hospitalizations, and deaths to date are from the period where the world was ""open"" and we all had hundreds of minor social interactions per day.

And guess what?  Oregon is crushing it.  We have enough ICU beds, we are sending ventillators to other states.  Go us.  Is it time to open things back up?  No, of course not.

But if 4 million people with hundreds of interactions per day resulted in us NOT overwhelming our hospital system, how exactly is being outdoors for a couple hours on the weekends and keeping your distance going to be worse than what we've already seen?  If you didn't already get coronavirus from your and your family's combined 1,000 interactions per day 3 weeks ago, I highly doubt a strong breeze at the park is going to be the thing to get you.

How about some positive news in this coronavirus restaurant storm?

Cossetta’s has finally started using the rotisserie that was installed when the complex was remodeled in 2014 and is offering rotisserie chickens and asiago roasted potatoes for takeout.

Owner Dave Cossetta said the restaurants and market were so busy before the virus hit that he hadn’t had the proper time to devote to developing and executing rotisserie recipes.

“We’re only running two things — the market and the eatery, so guess what? Dave has a lot of time on his hands,” Cossetta said.

They’re starting with chickens and potatoes tomorrow, but have recipes ready to go for turkey, porketta and chuck rolls using the eye of the chuck roast. There will eventually be a menu of roasted side items as well.

Cossetta said the pivot to takeout has been challenging, but he’s a planner, so it went fairly smoothly. The restaurant is offering its eatery menu for takeout and curbside pickup, which can be ordered online or over the phone. They are baking a limited amount of fresh bread for sale in the market, which is also open."

>‘Everyone’ will likely be infected with coronavirus ‘at some point,’ California health official says

I did not edit the punctuation.

The word EVERYONE and the phrase AT SOME POINT were both enclosed in the same single-quote punctuation. If single quotes should be presumed to be hyperbole, was the phrase AT SOME POINT also hyperbole?

Here's the quote from the article that contains the word EVERYONE and the phrase AT SOME POINT:

>A Santa Clara County health official said Monday that her department will likely be dealing with the new [coronavirus](https://www.foxnews.com/media/lindsey-graham-whole-world-send-china-bill) “for a very, very long time,” and at some point, everyone will probably be [infected.](https://www.foxnews.com/media/dr-tom-inglesby-coronavirus-return-to-normal)

So, was the word EVERYONE hyperbole? How about the phrase AT SOME POINT? 
Neither is enclosed in double-quotes in the article, so are we to presume that the official never actually said either of those two things? Was the official being hyperbolic? Was the Fox News reporter putting their own hyperbolic spin on the official's statements? I honestly can't tell. 

Also, on a larger level: This article doesn't appear to be an editorial or an opinion piece... So why are we even having to ask if anything in it is hyperbolic? Good journalism doesn't use editorialized hyperbole, that's for editorials and opinion pieces... If this was good journalism, no one should need to ask these sorts of questions at all. 

So, I think the overall lesson here is this:

Whether or not Trump's policies regarding China will have had a positive impact in the long term remains to be seen. In the short term, it has done a lot of damage. My brother is a fifth generation farmer who will likely never recover financially from the losses associated with the trade war with China.

Yes, China made mistakes in its initial handling of the coronavirus that likely will cost tens or hundreds of thousands of lives. This is not acceptable. The United States mistakes in handling the virus will probably be just as costly, if not more so.

[I was reading this earlier](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2020-04-08/nt-coronavirus-pushes-australians-and-homeless-to-the-brink/12124994) and it sounds already like in just two weeks these charities are at breaking point. 

People are lacking food and essentials at an unprecedented rate in living memory. So something needs to be done from the top down to make sure people are cared for. 

I don't want to sound alarmist - but imo we need to think about what we can do as things aren't just going to snap back to normal."

A viral myocarditis is different. This happens when there is damage to the cardiac muscle cells  causing inflammation from the virus directly or sometimes from the own immune system.

Currently, on the NextDoor app, my neighbors are rallying behind not buying anything from China as it may be contaminated with coronavirus, and only buying products made in the USA. 

My wife (who’s an out of work artist that has teamed up with other out of work artists) is making and selling cloth masks so we can make a mortgage payment this month... and so far all we’ve heard is that...

- our prices are too expensive ($10 for a single mask, $25 for 3... and they’re washable), 

- “amazon has them cheaper”, 

- and that we should be doing this for free for our community “instead of trying to profit off of a crisis” (even though these same people are the ones wiping out supplies in stores to resell, I report them all daily, to no avail).

The ones on amazon are those “made in China” products they’re trying to avoid and aren’t washable (they literally keep posting links of disposable masks). I tried to explain this to people but they kept telling me that “it comes from amazon, they’re american. And. If it is true, amazon is probably taking steps to disinfect them... because they’re amazon.”

Nevermind the fact I keep telling people we split that $10 per mask 5 ways... so everybody helping make and sell them are getting $2 per mask. That’s hardly enough for more material, much less to pay bills.

We hit 372 on the 5th and had 34 deaths between the 4th and the 5th.

He was also comparing it to the flu and claiming that those who were so concerned about coronavirus were people who never got their flu shots and dismissing the risks, and dismissing the analysis that there would be 400 deaths by the 7ths.  There was no concern by him over the collapse of the health care system.

We're also so far behind the curve for testing that it can't happen any more.  The rate of virus infection around the country is still growing exponentially, but we can't produce exponentially more testing kits.  That genie is never going back in the bottle, and it has nothing to do with Washington state and has everything to do with the initial response by the CDC.

He also cite South Korea but does not appreciate the level of contact tracing and testing that they did, along with everyone in SK wearing masks in public, and that SK is ALSO doing social distancing.

I can't believe that right now when he's been proven wrong, decisively, while we're in the middle of a clear health care crisis, that he's still doubling down on testing.  Once the hospital beds start to free up and the new cases are reduced, and as testing capacity ramps up we will certainly cross a point where testing can be used to combat the virus, but currently social distancing is the only viable tool in the toolbox.

* NOTE: This graph is a LOG scale - where exponential growth looks like a straight line. The real numbers are more scary. However, if the exponential growth slows, it should be more obvious on a log scale. Here's the same chart in linear scale:
https://imgur.com/a/5IXlI8r
* There was an excellent post a week ago showing a better way to graph to detect the improvement from exponential growth here: https://www.reddit.com/r/CanadaCoronavirus/comments/fqxgi7/how_to_tell_if_were_beating_covid19/ . I've started a graph using this model here, with South Korea showing the drop we'd like to see. We are not seeing the drop yet, but it does seem that the growth of the incoming rate has mostly levelled off over the last several days: https://imgur.com/a/spdtgie
* Here are some other graphs I'm playing with (MultiTrends): https://imgur.com/a/231TMhS - please note that I switched the deaths chart from log scale to linear scale.

* Canadian data from virihealth.com (from PHAC & provinces), USA data from coronavirus.1point3acres.com, Other national data was from WHO sitrep 78.
* I am not an epidemiologist. I'm not a government employee. I don't even play a doctor on TV. I just like numbers.

This data is admittedly imperfect: testing is incomplete, there is a test backlog, and reporting is not completely fluid.  This is too simplistic a model for realistic projection, given all of the unknowns and variables of such a complex system.  That said, I'll continue to track this, to see where it goes.

Today's data notes:  

* We are definitely climbing the curve of hospitalized and ICU cases. This is the first wave, the curve we're trying to flatten. Nationally, 1421 are hospitalized (+75 from yesterday), and 492 are in ICU (+12). Virihealth.com is doing a much better job tracking and graphing these than I. As these numbers climb, the burden on our healthcare workers will increase. Godspeed and thanks to them as they stand on guard for thee and me. 
* A new high of 58 deaths today, including the first in NS. The national total is 381 deaths (2.13% of known positives - this is not really the mortality rate, since that won't be known until all those infected are recovered or not, and may vary significantly if the healthcare system is overwhelmed)

* People tested (+10,101) = 355,807 (0.94% of the population). I was expecting higher # tests after the weekend slowdown, e.g. closer to 20K instead of 10K. 
* Tested positive (+1230) = 17,897 (5.03% of those tested). The cumulative hit rate climbs from 4.85% yesterday, rising 14 days in a row. Rising hit rate suggests that we need more widespread testing. I'm concerned about the climbing hit rate and the relatively low test numbers the last 3 days. 
* Test backlog - total is 3974, up 20 from 3954 yesterday. 
* Recovered = 4050 (22.5% of known positives).
* Known active = 13,466 (Total positives - recovered - deceased). The unknowns are unknown. 
* The bump in China's number @ day 29 was due to a change in the way their cases were categorized.
* The growth rate appears in cases seems to be slowing. Higher doubling time is better. March16 - doubling rate= every 2.84 days; March23=2.74 days; Mar30=4.21 days. These are averaged over a week, so I'll wait until next Thursday to update, but so far, it looks to improve more."

Once they’re lifted, family visitors have to have up to date flu and Tdap shots. Friends have to have flu shots.

As hard as it is telling family and grandparents that they can’t see the baby, this is about preventing disease spread and keeping everyone safe. Grandparents are high risk as they’re all over 60 (and 2 of them have other pre-existing conditions). We’ll have just spent time at a hospital and don’t want to get them sick. Additionally, we can’t stay completely isolated, as baby will have to go to relatively frequent pediatric appointments. Each person I allow to meet the baby is another person who could potentially spread the disease to us, and by doing so, we would then be responsible for possibly spreading the disease to doctors, nurses, and other patients at the doctor’s appointments. Then there’s also the risk to us and the kid. A newborn getting a fever in a lot of places means an automatic septic work up with spinal tap. I don’t even want to imagine the consequences of catching Coronavirus while also trying to figure out parenting and already being run-down and getting less sleep than I’m accustomed to.

Ultimately, it is selfish and may unintentionally cause someone’s death if I were to ignore state mandates and CDC guidelines just so grandma can hold the baby when she is first born. Until the pandemic is under better control, FaceTime will have to be enough."

That is *not* what he is saying though. He is just saying what numbers matter more for *their* purposes (i.e. assessing current or potential future demand on hospital resources for example or determining what governmental measures need to implemented) not that the overall case rates and recoveries don't matter at all (or don't indicate people contracted coronavirus).

I don't think this is anything new, as we KNOW many people are not being tested (so overall case rates can't be reflective of *actual* numbers infected) because at the end of the day it is hospitalizations, ICU admissions, that have the biggest impact on healthcare resources and policy decisions, and death rates that have the biggest impact for other reasons, including mentally and emotionally (and often those death rates reflect a burden on medical resources before that death). However many people test positive with mild symptoms really has no impact on healthcare resources until they end up as a hospitalization or beyond."

Individuals are also allowed to go for a walk or exercise outdoors once a day if adhering to social distancing guidelines, which means a gap of more than two metres unless with members of the same household.

But pictures and video have emerged on social media appearing to show some Spurs players ignoring those guidelines.

Spurs head coach Mourinho was pictured doing a session with midfielder Ndombele on Hadley Common, where it is believed the pair were only working together despite an image seeming to show two other people with them.


Davinson Sanchez and Ryan Sessegnon did their own work and were caught by a social media user running side by side around the same park in Barnet, north London.

This is the text of mine: (Edit: I am a CFS)

Date: April 7,2020

As this unprecedented coronavirus pandemic progresses, the Census Bureau will continue with COVID-19 pay for in-person operational staff for the pay week of April 5 - April 11, 2020. As most operations would have wrapped up by now, we will discontinue payments after April 11. However, we will keep your status active for future opportunities when we resume work.

You may be entitled to additional benefits such as unemployment insurance and expanded benefits as a result of recent relief legislation. Most of these programs are administered at the state level – you can check with your state to determine eligibility.

I know many of you just started work. Your contributions to the 2020 Census are greatly appreciated. Your health and safety is of the utmost importance to me and to the Census Bureau. It is my hope that when it is safe and we are fully operational again, you will be able to come back and help us complete the census count.

Please contact your supervisor with questions about the above.

Thank you again for your work.

It's like being given an option, take a possibly life saving mediation, or don't and wait for things to get worse, which may make the medication worthless. Yeah I'll take the chances to save myself, and this could be applied for the whole country. If you don't trust our government, you are basically saying we are screwed with Coronavirus.

Unless you are confusing the new ""novel coronavirus"" (SARS-CoV-2, which causes COVID-19) with all Coronaviruses.  There are something like 7 strains of coronaviruses, but the most common ones cause a mild cold, and the other two are SARS-CoV-1 and MERS-1, which are different diseases than we're worried about here.

Minister for Health Simon Harris will sign regulations on Tuesday night granting the Garda the powers to enforce sweeping restrictions on public movement and bring criminal prosecutions against those failing to comply.

The new powers were included in the emergency coronavirus legislation passed two weeks ago but only became active once the Minister signed them into use. Until now gardaí have been requesting rather than ordering people to comply with the guidelines.

Mr Harris announced he would activate the regulations following a meeting with the Garda Commissioner and the Attorney General on Tuesday. It is understood signing of the regulations had been delayed as the Government’s lawyers worked out the precise wording and extent of the powers.

Gardaí will now have the power to arrest and detain those who breach the restrictions. This includes those found exercising beyond 2km from their homes or those travelling for non-essential reasons.

Convictions will result in a maximum sentence of six months in prison and a fine of €2,500.

Gardaí will also have the power to assist the HSE in detaining someone judged to be at risk of spreading the virus who refuses to self isolate. Those refusing to comply with such orders face up to three months in prison.

The measures were to be enacted on Tuesday amid worries the fine weather will attract many people to public spaces over the coming bank holiday weekend.

Garda sources say the intention will be to only use the enforcement powers as a last resort, e.g. if someone refuses to return home when directed or are repeatedly caught breaking the regulations.

A Garda spokesman repeated on Tuesday that compliance from the public remains high.

Speaking on RTE’s Prime Time Mr Harris said it was important the gardai have these powers “in their back pocket” as a reserve should they need it.

The move comes ahead of the Easter Bank Holiday weekend. Earlier on Tuesday the [National Public Health Emergency Team](https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&tag_organisation=National+Public+Health+Emergency+Team) (NPHET) made a direct appeal to the public not to travel unnecessarily over Easter.

Expressing concern that a proportion of the population may seek to travel to holiday destinations, holiday homes and mobile homes over the Easter weekend, despite travel restrictions in place since March 27th.

It said it was grateful gardai have been “visibly present” on the roads over the past week “assisting the public with compliance”."

So in that sense, I think it is probably safer for the consumer to get groceries delivered.

However...as someone else mentioned, I am extremely uncomfortable with the idea of passing on my risk to the Instacart shopper. I think there are tons of situations where getting groceries delivered makes sense -- if you're sick, or have people at high risk for complications in your home, or need to minimize your risk for some other specific reason -- but as someone who is not at high risk for a severe illness, I plan to keep getting my own groceries, with an absolute minimum number of trips. It would be different if they actually closed the store off and only had staff inside packing grocery orders or something -- that would actually make a smaller set of people potentially spreading/getting the infection. But right now it seems like it's just a question of whether I can pay to have someone else take the risk for me, and I'm not doing that."

We couldn't make this shit up (although clearly many people can!) and there's no need to exaggerate! 

Essentially QAnon is a group of Trump's sycophants who believe in an outrageous conspiracy theory. It started with someone who goes by the name of Q on both 4Chan and 8chan, who claimed to be a high level government employee with level ""level Q security clearance,"" with extensive knowledge about the ""Clinton case"" and her imminent extradition. This was in 2017, so that obviously never happened. Someone else who went by FBIAnon actually started posting this stuff in 2016, before the election even happened. 

It mostly started with Pizzagate in 2016, and Hillary's role as leader of a huge pedophilia ring that involved all the DC Elite (only Democrats, of course, with Epstein listed amongst them). If you're not familiar with pizzagate, Q said that Hillary and others were trafficking children out of the basement of a family pizza parlor -Comet Ping Pong in DC. People ""ordered"" the children, using the words ""sauce"" or ""cheese"" as codes for specific types of children. Supposedly the kids were kept in the basement. Comet has no basement. No matter, though! That's just fake news. Now supposedly trump was the man the FBI was working with to take down this huge ring, and there were going to be hundreds, if not thousands of arrests, already in the works. Although that never happened, the cult still believes. At one point a man armed with an AR - 15 drove froM North Carolina to the restaurant to ""investigate"" since ""nobody was doing anything to save these kids!"" He went in, stormed into the back room, looking for the entrance to the non-existent basement. He actually fired a single gunshot (while families with kids were inside!) at the employee locker/storeroom door, which was locked with a padlock. He surrendered to the police surrounding the place when he realized there were no kids and no basement. He was sentenced to four years in jail. Since then, though, the owner continues to get death threats from QAnon followers who still believe it's a front for a pedophelia ring. Also, The Elite aren't just pedos anymore. Now They're part of a satanic cult. They've even ""killed numerous people who have gotten in Hillary and bill Clinton's way.""

The story gets weirder. Q would post random, cryptic posts on 8chan that supposedly contain hints about the DEEP STATE, who are trying to overthrow trump in a coup, and are working to undermine and the trump administration's work to end child sex trafficking. The coronavirus is also part of some deep state plan. The believers call these ""clues"" Breadcrumbs and have all kinds of crazy theories as they try to anaylyze what they mean. If Q mentions the word Wednesday"" in a post, and three weeks later trump leaves on a Wednesday to go to Mara-shit-hole, where he'll be ""working &  meeting with Very Important People to Make our Country GREAT AGAIN!!!"" That *proves* Q was right and was telling them something super important! Q claimed trump was actually working WITH Mueller on the Satanic pedo ring and they were going to bring it down! When that didn't happen it was because the Deep State somehow thwarted them. 

They have groups on Twitter, Facebook and YouTube and they even have meetups in some places. At trump rallies you'll see people wearing shirts with Q's on them, or one of their stock phrases like ""the storm is upon us."" Some of them believe democrats eat children. The Las Vegas shooting was an inside job. Coronavirus is either a hoax or bioengineered by the deep state to kill trump supporters. It goes on and on and on. And trump, instead of saying it's ridiculous actually feeds into it. Deliberately. Because of course he does. He'll retweet a Q ""leader."" He held up a baby at a rally with a big Q emblazoned on it diapered butt for everyone to see. 

It's a level of batshit crazy you cannot even imagine. It's fun to mock the insanity, but it's pretty scary that enough people believe this to do stupid things like storm a family pizza parlor with an AR-15, and block the road over the Hoover Dam with an armored vehicle. 

Now...don't you feel great about the future of our country?!"

The United Express Flight 3411 incident happened at Chicago O'Hare International Airport  on April 9, 2017, when David Dao Duy Anh, a Vietnamese-American passenger, was injured while being forcibly removed from a fully boarded, sold out flight to Louisville International Airport. Dao, a pulmonologist and folk musician, refused to give up his seat when requested because he needed to see a patient the day after.  Chicago Department of Aviation Security Officers were called to remove him from the plane; in the process, they struck Dao's face against an armrest, then pulled him, apparently unconscious, by his arms along the aircraft aisle past rows of onlooking passengers. Prior to the confrontation, managers offered travel vouchers to passengers to vacate their seats to make room for four deadheading airline employees who needed to travel to the destination, but none of the passengers accepted.

It seems extremely unlikely that they would start ratcheting down the statewide shelter-in-place orders until after that peak. And then, it will likely be slow and controlled and dependent of how far we get on widespread testing, contact tracing capabilities, etc. California did an absolutely kickass job flattening the curve and our state leadership isn't going to totally blow all that progress by flinging the doors open again and inviting in a resurgence.

I think it's pretty reasonable to question whether the park will be open for summer season. I don't really see a realistic pathway to opening by Memorial Day or even June; there are just too many unknowns still. And frankly, I love Yosemite, but the government is (rightly) going to be focused more on restarting the bigger economic drivers first.

I'm an Australian on a work visa in New York, and I've always been told that it's easier to leave the country to renew your visa, rather than getting it in-country. Most Australians get the E-3 visa rather than the H-1B so the requirements might be different (although I don't know if wrestlers get the O-1 or the P visas).

Two experts are urging caution on the use of this drug:

> An infectious diseases expert and former World Health Organization adviser, Prof Peter Collignon, said he was concerned the stockpiling was being driven by hype and panic.

> “*It a very bad idea to have panic driving drugs* we are going to give to people and *chloroquine is just an example of panic*,” Collignon said.

> “It is very important to look at and evaluate these drugs around the world but to *only issue these drugs after that evaluation*. **Or we run the risk of killing people**.""

[...]

> Dr Sacha Stelzer-Braid, a senior scientist in the virology research lab at the University of New South Wales and the Prince of Wales hospital, said while laboratory studies using hydroxychloroquine to inactivate the virus look promising, *we still needed to be cautious about the possible use of the drug to shorten the duration of infection or even possibly prevent infection*, if used prophylactically in healthcare workers, for example.

Hydroxychloroquine can have drastic side-effects and even lead to death."

Meanwhile, active cases in South Korea continue to fall and are now at 3500.

https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/country/south-korea/


 Why this is important-

Korea is a nearby country with a similar climate and (despite what many on each side may want to think), quite similar cultures.

Yet despite these similarities, both had very different containment strategies. Korea tested very aggressively and shut down early. Japan has greatly limited testing and focused on clusters.

Earlier, it was unclear which strategy worked best. Since Korea tested so extensively, it was hard to tell how well their containment strategy worked relative to our own. Therefore, it was still inconclusive if our containment strategy was the optimal one. All we knew was Japan seemed to have fewer cases than other places, which seemed encouraging.

However, we have now reached a juncture where *even without adjusting for their higher testing rate*, Korea has fewer active cases than we do, and they are seeing a gradual decreases in cases rather than an increase, like most other places- including us"

The two sides have traded some of the sharpest charges made between two nations since the Soviet Union in 1985 falsely accused the CIA of manufacturing AIDS.

U.S. intelligence officials don’t think the pandemic was caused by deliberate wrongdoing. The outbreak that has now swept the world instead began with a simpler story, albeit one with tragic consequences: The prime suspect is “natural” transmission from bats to humans, perhaps through unsanitary markets. But scientists don’t rule out that an accident at a research laboratory in Wuhan might have spread a deadly bat virus that had been collected for scientific study.

“Good science, bad safety” is how Sen. Tom Cotton (R-Ark.) put this theory in a Feb. 16 tweet. He ranked such a breach (or natural transmission) as more likely than two extreme possibilities: an accidental leak of an “engineered bioweapon” or a “deliberate release.” Cotton’s earlier loose talk about bioweapons set off a furor, back when he first raised it in late January and called the outbreak “worse than Chernobyl.”

President Trump and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo added to the bile last month by describing the coronavirus as the “Chinese virus” and the “Wuhan virus,” respectively.

China dished wild, irresponsible allegations of its own. On March 12, Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Lijian Zhao charged in a tweet: “It might be [the] US army who brought the epidemic to Wuhan.” He retweeted an article that claimed, without evidence, that U.S. troops might have spread the virus when they attended the World Military Games in Wuhan in October 2019.

China retreated on March 22, when Ambassador to the United States Cui Tiankai told “Axios on HBO” that such rumors were “crazy” on both sides. A State Department spokesman said Cui’s comment was “welcome,” and Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping pledged in a March 27 phone call to “focus on cooperative behavior,” a senior administration official told me.

To be clear: U.S. intelligence officials think there’s no evidence whatsoever that the coronavirus was created in a laboratory as a potential bioweapon. Solid scientific research demonstrates that the virus wasn’t engineered by humans and that it originated in bats.

But how did the outbreak occur? Solving this medical mystery is important to prevent future pandemics. What’s increasingly clear is that the initial “origin story” — that the virus was spread by people who ate contaminated animals at the Huanan Seafood Market in Wuhan — is shaky.

Scientists have identified the culprit as a bat coronavirus, through genetic sequencing; bats weren’t sold at the seafood market, although that market or others could have sold animals that had contact with bats. The Lancet noted in a January study that the first covid-19 case in Wuhan had no connection to the seafood market.

There’s a competing theory — of an accidental lab release of bat coronavirus — that scientists have been puzzling about for weeks. Less than 300 yards from the seafood market is the Wuhan branch of the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention. Researchers from that facility and the nearby Wuhan Institute of Virology have posted articles about collecting bat coronaviruses from around China, for study to prevent future illness. Did one of those samples leak, or was hazardous waste deposited in a place where it could spread?

Richard Ebright, a Rutgers microbiologist and biosafety expert, told me in an email that “the first human infection could have occurred as a natural accident,” with the virus passing from bat to human, possibly through another animal. But Ebright cautioned that it “also could have occurred as a laboratory accident, with, for example, an accidental infection of a laboratory worker.” He noted that bat coronaviruses were studied in Wuhan at Biosafety Level 2, “which provides only minimal protection,” compared with the top BSL-4.

Ebright described a December video from the Wuhan CDC that shows staffers “collecting bat coronaviruses with inadequate [personal protective equipment] and unsafe operational practices.” Separately, I reviewed two Chinese articles, from 2017 and 2019, describing the heroics of Wuhan CDC researcher Tian Junhua, who while capturing bats in a cave “forgot to take protective measures” so that “bat urine dripped from the top of his head like raindrops.”

And then there’s the Chinese study that was curiously withdrawn. In February, a site called ResearchGate published a brief article by Botao Xiao and Lei Xiao from Guangzhou’s South China University of Technology. “In addition to origins of natural recombination and intermediate host, the killer coronavirus probably originated from a laboratory in Wuhan. Safety level may need to be reinforced in high risk biohazardous laboratories,” the article concluded. Botao Xiao told the Wall Street Journal in February that he had withdrawn the paper because it “was not supported by direct proofs.”

Accidents happen, human or laboratory. Solving the mystery of how covid-19 began isn’t a blame game, but a chance for China and the United States to cooperate in a crisis, and prevent a future one."

Modeling the course of the coronavirus pandemic may still be as much art as science as projections are shifting as more information becomes available. The good news is that conditions in most of the country are less dire than early models predicted, and public-health experts will have to study the reasons to help the country emerge from this economically destructive shutdown.

The so-called Murray model by the University of Washington’s Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation on Tuesday projected 81,766 fatalities over the next four months, which is about the same as it forecast two weeks ago. But predictions for individual states have shifted, sometimes dramatically.

Forecasted fatalities have fallen in North Carolina (-80%), Pennsylvania (-75%), California (-70%), Texas (-65%) and Washington (-55%) and even by nearly two-thirds in Louisiana despite its recent surge in cases. Death projections, on the other hand, have increased by more than half in New York and 133% in New Jersey.

More states are also predicted to experience their peak demand for hospital resources sooner. The Murray model now shows that Washington hit its apex on April 2—17 days earlier than forecast two weeks ago. California is expected to hit its peak on April 14—10 days earlier—though Gov. Gavin Newsom has projected the date at sometime in mid-May.

The Murray team say their projections changed because their early modeling was based largely on data coming from China. “The time from implementation of social distancing to the peak of the epidemic in the Italy and Spain location is shorter than what was observed in Wuhan,” they note. This underlines the limitations of existing models.

As Anthony Fauci of the White House coronavirus task force noted last week, models are only as good as the assumptions fed into them. One problem is there isn’t consensus among public-health experts about how variables other than social distancing affect transmission and fatalities. Nor, by the way, do models account for how treatments could reduce deaths and hospital utilization.

The Murray March 26 study noted that its model accounts for population age structure but not the “many other factors that may influence the epidemic trajectory: the prevalence of chronic lung disease, the prevalence of multi-morbidity, population density, use of public transport, and other factors that may influence the immune response.”

These variables are worth closer study since places in the U.S. that adopted social-distancing measures at roughly the same time are experiencing enormous variation. New York’s per capita fatalities are about 25 times higher than California’s though both states shut down businesses at about the same time.

New York state is about twice as dense as California, and New York City’s population is about 300 times more concentrated than the U.S. as a whole and 11 times more than Los Angeles County. More than half of people in New York City use public transportation where they have a higher risk of virus exposure.

Even within cities there is substantial variation among populations. In Chicago the fatality rate for blacks is about six to seven times higher than for whites or Hispanics, which may be due to higher rates of cardiovascular disease and HIV. Life expectancy for black Americans is also about seven years lower than for Hispanics and three-and-a-half years lower than for whites.

In New York City, the coronavirus has hit the Bronx and West Queens much harder than Manhattan. But those neighborhoods also have large numbers of multigenerational households, which is thought to have stoked outbreaks in Italy and Spain. This could also help explain why per capita fatalities are 70% higher in Los Angeles County than in San Francisco.

The point is that coronavirus models are one guide to the pandemic future, and often imperfect. They should also be one among other factors in determining government pandemic policy such as when to start reopening parts of the country. They’re a tool, not an oracle."

It would take hundreds and hundreds of buses to transport 35,000 children from China Lake to the Mercy ship anchored in Los Angeles.  Somehow, this would probably attract the attention of, I dunno, say, the CHP and local news and others—especially during a pandemic shutdown.  But hey, nothing like exposing these kids to the CoronaVirus by taking them into the heart of LA.  Save them from the face-eating, Satanic, Deep State cannibals only to kill them by exposing their ravaged, emaciated, malnutrition-riddled bodies to the CoronaVirus—which, BTW, is so totally a Deep State plant intended to remove Trump from office.

*IBM and Nazi Germany*

“I only know that this [very modern equipment](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/ibm-and-nazi-germany/) made possible the control of all the railway traffic in the General Government (of Poland),"" he said.

*Where are your papers?*

“Eventually we have some digital certificates to show who has recovered or been tested recently
or when we have a vaccine who has received it.”

-Bill Gates 

“Gates also called for a [“national tracking system,”](https://newspunch.com/bill-gates-coronavirus-means-need-digital-certificates-prove-who-received-vaccine/) saying that “in Seattle, the [University of Washington] is providing thousands of tests per day but no one is connected to a national tracking system” and that “Whenever there is a positive test it should be seen to understand where the disease is and whether we need to strengthen the social distancing.”

On matters pertinent to the WHO-declared pandemic.”

“But WHO didn’t always see the coronavirus as a pandemic.  As a matter of fact, WHO didn’t announce the coronavirus as a pandemic until the very day after Gates — who had wished for some time that WHO would declare the coronavirus a pandemic — well, until the very day after Gates made a very large donation to a cause that benefits WHO.”


From the Memory Hole:

2010: Newport West MP Paul Flynn claimed that the decision by the World Health Organization to declare a pandemic had been influenced by pharmaceutical companies.

""We know [the only people who benefited were pharmaceutical companies.](https://www.bbc.com/news/10396382) They had a huge influence in defining what a pandemic is.""

Coronavirus is a type/category of virus.

H1N1 is a specific strain of influenza, it is 'credited' with the 1918-19 and the 2009.

COVID-19 is the disease caused by sars-cov-2, which is a specific strain of coronavirus. (FWIW, SARS, the circa 2003 disease with a case fatality rate of 10%, is a coronavirus that goes by sars-cov)

Both influenza viruses and coronaviruses are single helix RNA viruses, which means both flu and corona viruses are expected to mutate rapidly and frequently, probably, so there is a real risk that coronavirus will be a seasonal-forever thing with different strains that you can catch repeatedly each season, like influenza. It could be more, less, or equally deadly to the seasonal flu. It (meaning sars-cov-2) could not mutate and be gone in a year or two for practical purposes. Time will tell."

As for the adverse effects, that’s the beauty of these meds - they’re old and therefore we’re quite well acquainted with their side-effects and safety profiles.

Really appreciate the gesture of making it royalty free, and I hope it gains traction among some big media outlets.

I have done several molecular animations in the past working in collab with doctors and scientists. I think scientifically accurate CGI videos have the potential to completely change the way all science is taught in the future, and hopefully current world events will drive a lot of talented animators to learn more about it.

If you have Maya, I would highly recommend you and your team take a look at the mMaya plugin: 
https://clarafi.com/tools/mmaya/
It allows you to import PDB files, which are the 3D structure files of molecules produced by molecular biologists using electron microscopes. I believe there is an equivalent plugin for C4D.

The actual structure of the spike protein (like the ones used in the CDC's 3D coronavirus model) can be found here:
https://www.rcsb.org/3d-view/6VXX

One thing I found which is really interesting:
https://science.sciencemag.org/content/367/6485/1444
https://www.rcsb.org/3d-view/6M18/1
This study and PDB shows how two spike proteins bind to ACE2 to form a complex, which may be a key feature in how it gains entry to the cell.

Obviously its more complicated to pull off, but I would love to see updated CGI biology animations as our knowledge of the virus improves. Might even try my hand at modifying this one to use the real protein structures when I get some free time."

The allegations he's part of some population control agenda is bullshit.  He's out trying to cure malaria, one of the largest killers of people in undeveloped nations in the world.  He put a billion dollars of his own money into fielding 7 different vaccines to fight coronavirus.  He's been warning us for over a decade we are not prepared for an outbreak of this kind and he was completely right.

It makes no logical fucking sense that someone who would be for a depopulation agenda would try to cure endemic third world diseases like malaria or spend a bunch of money to produce a vaccine during a pandemic.

The allegations he is somehow profiting from this are without any evidence.  There is no paper trail showing Gates profiting from anything.  He doesnt even draw a salary from his foundation, all he does is put money into it to support programs.

Critical thinking is telling me there is absolutely no evidence to substantiate the claims being made against Gates and they don't make any sense based on his actions.  Theres no money trail showing he's making money from these endeavors.  There's only circumstantial evidence.  The references to an exercise about a pandemic outbreak neglect the fact the conclusions of that exercise showed the exact ways our systems have failed in response to that kind of threat.  

I don't care about downvotes.  I'm a free thinker pushing back against a bullshit narrative without any evidence underpinning the claims.  Meanwhile our President has completely failed to respond to this national security crisis and has tried to profit from it.  

The real conspiracy, just like the conspiracy surrounding 911, is the complete non-action at the federal level to respond to a crisis that is projected to take more lives than every war America has ever been in.  It's not Bill Gates."

The states with the lowest mortality rates are the US and Germany, both of which are multi-payer healthcare. The US had a mortality rate of 2.5%. Germany was 1.7. France and Spain were 8.4 and 9.4% respectively.

If you look at cases per million people, as well as mortality rates from known cases, there is a Stark difference between Spain, Italy, and France, compared to the US and Germany.


The whole advocating for open church services thing is also a largely false narrative. Churches in several states have been seemed essential, yes, but most churches cancelled services before a lot of states even issued shelter in place orders.

(AP) — Arkansas’ governor on Tuesday opposed allowing cities to issue their own stay-at-home orders during the coronavirus outbreak while the state resists such a restriction.

Gov. Asa Hutchinson, who is among a handful of governors who haven’t issued stay-at-home orders, said those restrictions need to be dealt with on a statewide basis. Hutchinson said a number of mayors have talked with him about the issue.

“I think it points up the need to have a statewide policy because if you have a business in one community, it impacts others,” Hutchinson said. “If you have essential services in one community, it serves the entire state if not more.”

For most people, the coronavirus causes mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough that clear up in two to three weeks. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia.

Little Rock Mayor Frank Scott said he’d like to be able to issue such a restriction. Little Rock has imposed a nighttime curfew in response to the outbreak.

Health officials said the number of coronavirus cases in the state had risen to at least 946. The state reported two additional deaths, bringing its total to 18."

There's thousands of acres of public recreational land in the Richmond metro area. I know it's frustrating that the convenient ones are increasingly more crowded at peak times but that's the way things are for awhile and that's OKAY. Those of us with the capability and time should relieve the city parks by making an effort to visit those less crowded facilities for our hiking, running, biking, etc. A short drive can take you to some beautiful battlefields, parks, refuges, etc. If you can't make the drive then try to enjoy your recreation time during off peak hours.

There are major proven health benefits to being outdoors including absorbing vitamin D, reduction of anxiety, improved sleep and all of which contribute to a stronger immune system. The coronavirus in particular is exacerbated by high blood pressure and numerous studies show daily outdoor exercise helps mitigate hypertension."

>Some Wuhan residents estimate that the coronavirus death toll could be 26,000, based on the amount of urns being delivered and distributed across the city.

2020-04-07,Revivous,nrl,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/nrl/comments/fwuixd/inside_the_panther_bubble_the_proposal_that_could/fmqhtlk/,"The Panthers Leagues Club group has offered the NRL access to its sprawling facilities in western Sydney as part of an ambitious plan to get the game back under way as early as next month.

The Panthers complex in Penrith, home to a 222-room hotel, four training fields, three gyms a vacant leagues club and a stadium, will on Thursday be put forward as a leading option that would co-exist alongside the Sydney Olympic Park precinct as part of a western Sydney bubble.

The Penrith proposal, which was presented to innovation committee members on Tuesday, ticks all the boxes - including isolated training fields, accommodation, dining facilities, separate team rooms and multiple gyms.

[The Panthers Academy is regarded as one of the best, if not the best, rugby league facility on the planet.](https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.552%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.776846%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_0/t_crop_custom/q_86%2Cf_auto/013869c8e7e32bf19dbcc2b4d21bf10b4b22cc5e)

The precinct would cater for up to eight teams, with the 222-room Mercure Hotel providing direct internal access into the now vacant leagues club, which has eight empty conference rooms ready to be transformed into individual team bunkers.

""The players would go straight from the hotel into team rooms, training and dining options without having any contact with the outside world,"" Panthers Group chief executive Brian Fletcher told the Herald.

""We can create an isolated community, or bubble for that matter. The only time they would leave the facility is when the teams train across the road, but we could organise shuttles across into the stadium or training grounds. They can live through the hotel and club area while it's all on.

""We have training grounds out the back of the club but if they have to use the grounds across the road, the bus will pick them up at the front door and drop them off. All the things that need to be managed can be managed. And the other thing is it's a great opportunity for some of the 600 people we had to stand down to maybe get back in the work force if they are willing to isolate in the bubble as well.""

On the back of some of the expert medical advice, the NRL wants to be close to testing and result laboratories to ensure biosecurity measures aren't compromised in the fight against coronavirus.

It's also clear that NSW is set to host the bubble, given some of the government assurances the game has been given.

There's also a belief that two separate bubbles, rather than having all 16 teams in one location, would help minimise the risk of infection and ensure the entire playing group wasn't in danger of contamination.

That would allow the NRL to quarantine and self-isolate positive-tested players and keep the competition running.

[Teams playing at Panthers Stadium would not have to leave their bubble, although private buses would take teams directly into ANZ Stadium or Bankwest Stadium for when they play against clubs from the Olympic Park bubble.](https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.265%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.776846%2C$width_1059%2C$x_20%2C$y_0/t_crop_custom/q_86%2Cf_auto/2c82125c8ddcaf746aec24cc6d1f3ea41ada07fa)

It's likely teams wouldn't have to leave their bubble for the first seven rounds, playing against each other until they reach the halfway mark of the season.

By that stage, when teams in rival bubbles are due to square off, isolation and social gathering restrictions may be loosened.

One of the other NRL considerations is the mental wellbeing of players within a bubble. Panthers could transform its 760-seat theatre into a cinema for players. There is also a bar and dining area to relax.

Table tennis, poker tables and video game consoles would all be included for the eight teams to use during their time together.

Panthers Academy

* Two separate gyms (the main gym could easily cater for two teams at a time plus there is another room that is currently used for yoga that was originally designed as the juniors gym).
* Two training fields
* Ice baths and spa baths
* Two dressing rooms
* Amphitheatre for video sessions
* Medical rooms
* Office space
* Kitchen and dining area
* Running track
* Meeting/boardrooms

Panthers Leagues Club

* Eight conference rooms transformed into eight team rooms
* Internal club access to Mercure Hotel
* Vacant office complex that could be used by club officials
* Restaurants and bar
* 760-seat theatre for entertainment
* Aqua golf
* Barbecue area
* Arcade game area

Panthers Stadium

* Match-day venue
* Gym facility
* Two training fields (includes council-owned cricket ground)
* Office space
* Four dressing rooms
* 250-seat chairman's lounge that could be split into team rooms or gyms
 
Mercure Hotel

* 222 rooms that can cater for around 400 people
* Outdoor recovery pool
* Gym
* Direct internal access to Leagues club and team rooms"

The American Hotel and Lodging Association announced Monday that more than 15,000 hotels across the country have signed up to provide temporary housing for emergency and healthcare workers as the COVID-19 public health crisis grows.

At least 312 of those hotels were in Arizona, the association said.

Kim Sabow, president and CEO of the Arizona Lodging and Tourism Association, said the idea of the initiative, called ""Hospitality for Hope,"" was to create a database where local hotel associations could connect hotels with the healthcare community and local officials as needs arise.

Different hotels are laid out to accommodate different needs, so state and federal government officials can search for participating hotels based on their location, Sabow said.

If the situation worsens, some hotels could potentially be used as an emergency hospital or places for quarantined individuals to stay if more hospital beds are needed, she said."

He needs to use his constituents as an instrument of power.

He has the highest support among Independents in every states exit polling if I’m not mistaken. the largest voting block in the country, and Bernie hasn’t mentioned it once. The coronavirus is great and all, but it honestly doesn’t matter let it speak for itself. This primary has always been, and continues to be about ELECTABILITY. He needs to get off YouTube and Twitter where everyone already loves him and get on the major networks. Earned media is still king for the demographic he needs to reach. He shouldn’t just go after Medicare for All either he should change the topic every week. For example he should also come out of left field and push coronavirus related releases of non-violent offenders  from jail specifically in the name of protecting the correctional officers and staff from getting infected. Start applying pressure one state at a time if he has too. Then next week it’s Green New Deal and argue financials benefits only, they don’t care about the benefit to the Earth. Finally he needs to put a whole lot of effort into reaching out to rural communities in crisis to get their vote. They generally have an outsized influence because of they way delegate math works, winning counties is what matters. They also vote more consistently because there are less barriers to voting and lines aren’t as long, although we should really have a 100% Mail-in election at this point. 

Sorry it’s so long. I have more but I’ll stop.

# PUBLIC DANGER ALERT 🚨 Ball Honda of National City This  post is a public danger alert regarding Ball Honda of National City.  

# There have been two employees, Finance Managers, who have tested  positive for Coronavirus there in the last 48 hours. Finance Managers  are the people who finalize all your paperwork with your car purchase.  They talk to every customer that purchases a car in a small enclosed  office and no these employees were not wearing masks. I also am looking  for suggestions or help with what we as San Diegans, and what the  employees of Ball Honda, can do about how it is being handled.

Most  car dealerships in San Diego only have their service departments open  with a skeleton staff. Ball Honda meanwhile has been going about  business as usual to this very second. They are also killing it with  sales right now sad to say. Not much competition and apparently buying a  new Honda is considered essential. Shame on them. It gets much worse  though. Prepare to get angry. Also, this is a small city, and I have no  doubt that there will be people reading this who can confirm what I am  saying because they know someone who works at Ball Honda. My connection  is personal, and I have known many of the employees there for well over a  decade.

Jennifer Ball, who runs  the dealership and is an owner, just last week was telling people that  the Coronavirus is basically a bunch of bullshit. Then she sent out a  YouTube video to several employees backing up her beliefs. Several days  ago, due to how busy their sales department is she called back an  employee whom they had fired before to help out. He showed up with a  102-degree temperature. Jennifer Ball herself was informed. This person  is still working there and dealing with the general public as you read  this.

Today, after learning that 2  of her employees, the finance managers, tested positive for  Coronavirus, she held a meeting with her managers informing them that no  one was to talk about it. Yes. She told her managers, none of whom  would lie under oath for her in the event of a lawsuit, to keep their  mouths shut about who, what, when, where, why, and how regarding 2  positive tested Coronavirus employees who have had contact with the  public as recently as yesterday. IF YOU BOUGHT A CAR OR KNOW SOMEONE WHO  HAS BOUGHT A CAR AT BALL HONDA RECENTLY THEY ARE IN DANGER AND SO ARE  YOU.

Obviously, word got out to  the entire dealership workforce about what Jennifer Ball did this  morning. Here is what has happened since. Dozens of employees have made  calls to 211, 911, OSHA both state, city, and local, calls to the CDC,  and the police have shown up several times. When humans have responded  to the employees, including the police, they have been told there is  nothing they can do. SO, THEY CAN GIVE TICKETS TO PEOPLE SITTING IN  THEIR CARS WATCHING THE SUNSET AT THE BEACH BUT THERE IS NOTHING THEY  CAN DO ABOUT A COVER UP OF CORONAVIRUS EMPLOYEES WHO DEAL WITH THE  GENERAL PUBLIC.

I, along with well  over a hundred employees, and hundreds if not thousands of friends and  family members of them, are absolutely flabbergasted and at a loss at to  what to do. So far two of my friends have walked off the job and they  have been told that their unemployment will be fought!!!! Holy shit!!!!

Please. Advice, suggestions, or help would be greatly appreciated. Again, all of this can be confirmed easily. WHAT DO WE DO?

Edit: I have emailed this to ALL THE LOCAL NEWS STATIONS. Can you please share this post any way you can?

Edit 2: Save your upvotes AND SHARE THE GODDAMN POST. The mods at [r/sandiego](https://www.reddit.com/r/sandiego/)  won’t allow this post. When we trace a bunch of hospitalizations and  deaths back to Ball Honda then you can say you tried to sound the alarm,  too.

Today we had an increase of 379 confirmed cases, slightly more than yesterday. However, we tested much less as well, 2.5k cases vs 3.7k cases yesterday. Plus we're also back to deaths in the twenties again with 21 deaths today. 

Really really disappointing at the decrease in testing, what we need is more and more testing. Not less.

NOTE: The confirmed cases does not refer to the number of positive cases as it also includes ""resolved"" and deceased cases. The exact number of positive cases can no longer be determined as the new definition of ""resolved"" also includes cases that are not currently hospitalized, as long as its been 14 days. Meaning you could be infected with the virus but if you're currently not hospitalized, you're considered ""resolved"".

What’s really informative about the WA data reporting is the epidemiologic curves, which display the results as day of symptom onset and date of death. I assume that when they are testing a patient, they are asked when they first experienced symptoms. It’s the symptom onset date that is reported when the results come back, not the date of test, and not the date of the result. This gives a more accurate count even if test reporting slows on the weekend. Just know that the last few days worth of data may not have come in yet."

Jan 8th, it was confirmed to be a coronavirus. Jan 10th the gene sequence was released publicly online. I'm no epidemiologist or disease expert but that doesn't seem like ""literally zero information"". CDC director was briefed Jan 3. Again, that's not zero information. 

I do agree that this information could have been made public earlier (if China had the information to be released). 

However, my point still stands. If a virus is scary enough that China would shut down a city and their economy on Jan 23 (after they confirmed H2H transmission), that's more than enough of a ""RED ALERT"" that this is serious.

> They knew for a month that the virus was capable of human-to-human transmission and waited until cases were being identified in other countries to officially confirm transmission was possible.

Source for the knowing for a month? They confirmed H2H after Zhong Nanshan alerted everyone it was after 2 medical staff were infected in Guangdong where he was.

2020-04-07,polabud,COVID19,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/fwwgn1/substantial_undocumented_infection_facilitates/fmr779k/,"Oh, I wasn't talking globally, I was talking about the US. There will already be millions of deaths globally, the question is what countries that have the resources to respond properly are going to do. I'm obviously a little incensed that certain people on this message board continue to insist, after WEEKS of nearly conclusive contrary evidence, that the ""herd immunity"" strategy is anything but cold-blooded murder of the most vulnerable.

You're right, there are serious challenges to test-trace. ""South Korea!"" isn't a model - it's a distinct country with experience in coronavirus outbreaks and competence that most lack. Lots of transmission is pre- or asymptomatic. Our PCR tests aren't sensitive enough. Superspreader events mean even one mistake can cost us dearly. Lack of data, political willpower, and popular participation makes it extremely difficult for the west, especially the anglosphere. Test-and-trace is flawed.

Herd immunity, on the other hand, is perfect. It requires the least amount of effort - some employees to guard nursing homes, and maybe mandatory work-from-home for those with comorbidities. And it sounds really nice in theory - let's get all our young strong people infected and beat this thing without modern science or oppressive government.

But it doesn't work that way. Especially in poorer communities, which are already being hit incredibly hard by this thing in a way people on this board like to gloss over with fatuous arguments for a ""0.1% IFR"" or a ""flu-like severity,"" intergenerational living is incredibly common. Presymptomatic transmission? It's worse in the herd immunity scenario - people cripple their vulnerable loved ones without even knowing it. And as this thing rips through the country, which it will if we think that argument and bluster and determination are enough to bend reality, the healthcare system will be overwhelmed an order of magnitude more than they now are in New York City, where the morgues cannot keep up and there has been a tenfold increase in the number of people dying in their own homes - none, of course, recorded in the statistics. 

But all that's fine, obviously. Didn't you hear? 200% of NYC is infected. The fatality rate is really 0.00001%! Let's all get back to work and stop this panic.

Honestly, I'm exhausted with batting down terrible, dangerous, disingenuous arguments on this forum. We have enough data to know for a fact that, when this thing rips through a community, the suffering is unimaginable. Take Castiglione d'adda, the town you may have heard of as proof that Italy had reached herd immunity. It's true, a non-random blood test found a strikingly high proportion of positives. 1.7% of the entire town's population died of COVID. 80 human beings dead in a town of 4600. So far. Serology studies from towns elsewhere in northern Italy have found much smaller prevalence - 13% in Robbio, for example.

Or take a look at the best cohort study we have - the Diamond Princess. Of course, everyone said in March, this cohort is just proof that the fatality rate must be many orders of magnitude below the topline figure. After all, the population is *elderly,* and we're not, so why should we panic? Meanwhile, the fatalities have increased pretty consistently to 11 out of 712 now. 8 remain on ventilators or in the ICU. 50% of COVID ICU patients die. It's difficult to tell from the data, but they've been there for about a month now. Prognoses decline the longer you need that kind of care. But, of course, we should entertain the idea that ""50% of everyone has been infected!"" Preposterous. 

I just don't know what it will take for people to stop treating the ""herd immunity"" strategy with respect. It's not a real thing any scientist, public health official, or epidemiologist is calling for. It's just a thing that people on this board, shielded by its former (and long-lost, in my opinion) reputation as a place for serious scientific discussion, put forward to justify attacks on the social distancing measures. I hope they understand how much danger they'd be putting everyone in if they win the debate."

- As with ""normal"" unemployment insurance, an employer will have to pay unemployment tax for any employee who files and qualifies for unemployment under the Coronavirus guidelines.

- When the business is cleared to reopen, the employer will receive a tax credit for each employee they rehire who received unemployment payments during that time. So it really behooves the company to re-hire as many people as possible.

So, if your company reaches out to rehire you and you refuse or do not respond, they will report that to unemployment, and you will be disqualified from further unemployment payments. 

If the company does not reopen or does not offer to rehire you, then you would most likely be eligible to continue, however, you would be expected to provide proof that you are actively looking for another job in order to maintain your benefits."

As I just wrote on another thread, you can't take every single person who die at home or in a nursing home, put him on a table, waste tests to check him if he had Coronavirus (at least 2 tampons you need to avoid false positives) and not only that but also perform an autopsy to see how he died, Coronavirus or other preexistin condition.. For every single person (= thousands and thousands)

We did do post-mortem test but we had to stop soon. I heard Germany do tho, they can, we can't."

Studies using more recent data have come to the same conclusion. In a 2019 [study](https://www.ajpmonline.org/article/S0749-3797(19)30197-7/fulltext), researchers found that states with high levels of household gun ownership have more domestic gun homicides than other states do. In fact, the quartile of states with the highest rates of gun ownership have 65 percent more domestic gun homicides than the quartile with the least, which is worrisome considering that domestic violence has [worsened](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2020/04/01/measures-control-spread-coronavirus-are-nightmare-victims-domestic-violence-advocates-are-demanding-that-governments-step-up/) during the coronavirus outbreak."

And that's the primary message I want from the UFC. What ARE their coronavirus protocols, and how are they guarantee safety for everybody involved. White mentions of course that they'll be tested, but that's just speculation until we get more tangible details. 

Given the UFC's history of pressuring fighters into fights, I am wary of them also pressuring relevant personnel into a risky situation. As it stands, more details are needed."

&#x200B;

The preliminary results of a study done with chloroquine by Fiocruz and the Tropical Medicine Foundation showed that the lethality in the group of patients with Covid-19 tested, in serious condition, was 13%.

Of 81 inpatients who took the drug, 11 died.

The mortality rate seen in patients in the same condition who did not use the drug is 18%, according to international studies, including in China.

The proximity of the two indices does not allow to affirm, for the time being, that chloroquine can make a fundamental difference in the treatment of patients infected with the new coronavirus.

""Optimists may think that \[the rate with the use of chloroquine\] is lower. Pessimists may think that it is the same. Statistically, it is the same, in the margin of confidence"", says infectologist Marcus Lacerda, from Fiocruz, who participates in the study .

The research must therefore continue until the data is conclusive. ""Anything can. But we can't find anything,"" he says, reaffirming that it is necessary to wait for the scientific and safe conclusions of the study.

He predicts that 440 patients, from different hospitals in the country, will be tested - and it can last for two to three months. The research group is also integrated by cardiologist Ludhmila Hajjar, from Incor de SP.

The initial idea was that half of the patients would take a 10g dose of chloroquine and the other group, half of that.

The higher dose, however, proved to be toxic, causing unwanted reactions, such as arrhythmia and ""other serious complications"", says Marcus Lacerda.

The preliminary conclusions have already been sent for publication in a scientific journal precisely because the tests showed that the higher dose of chloroquine can cause damage. And conclusions about patient safety need to be made known quickly.

""When we compared the groups of different doses, we saw more toxicity at the high dose. That's why we suspended this arm of the study,"" says the doctor. ""Now everyone will use only the low dose.""

""Our study \[so far\] can only state that the high dose is very toxic"", concludes Marcus Lacerda.

The use of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine in patients with coronavirus has become a watchword for President Jair Bolsonaro, who wants to release the use even before the safe completion of studies in Brazil and worldwide.

Health Minister Luiz Mandetta has refused to endorse widespread use before the scientists' final word."
