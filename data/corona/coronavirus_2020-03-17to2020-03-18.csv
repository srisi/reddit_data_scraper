My family lives in the Veneto, in Northern Italy, one of the regions worst hit by the novel coronavirus. We are on lockdown. It’s scary. It’s lonely. It’s uncomfortable. And did I mention scary?

I’ll spare you the statistics and the sermons; both are already abundant. But I do want to make one thing clear: If you think that by stocking up your pantries you have absolved yourself from the responsibility of preparing for this virus, you are mistaken. This is a crisis like none before. Be skeptical of both naysayers and doomsayers; there’s no way of knowing how this will end.

The restrictions came upon us slowly but steadily. Within two weeks, our old lives were gone. First the schools closed, then came social distancing. Then the government locked down the hardest-hit areas: no more going in and out of certain provinces; limited movements within the “red zones.” Then the whole country shut down. Most stores closed their doors. People who could were asked to telework; those who could not, and did not have a job related to the continuation of essential services, were placed on part-time schedules or unpaid leave. When we went out, we had to carry a pass explaining our reasons for being outside to show to the law enforcement officers patrolling the streets. The priority became keeping everyone inside, at all times.

For some people, the gradual rollout made these measures hard to accept: Skeptical observers questioned the seriousness of the disease, given that the restrictions were not draconian from the start. And yet without time to adjust to a progressive loss of freedom, we wouldn’t have accepted it. We might have rebelled. Instead, we rallied, coming together as one — protecting each other’s health, even as we could no longer socialize.

Living under these conditions is difficult to describe. We can only leave the house out of medical necessity or to get food. We can go on short walks but not in groups. We can’t hug, kiss or shake hands with anyone outside of our family. We must stay at least four feet from everyone else, at all times.

My family tries to maintain a routine: In the mornings, I home-school our four children, who range from kindergarten to eighth grade, while my husband teleworks. My eldest son’s school was the best prepared for distance learning and began remote lessons from the first week of the lockdown. He gets live lessons, homework, regular interaction with his teachers — and just as importantly, regular interaction with friends, which lessens his sense of isolation. It’s great, really, but it also requires a dedicated laptop and bandwidth from 8:10 a.m. to 2:45 p.m. daily, limiting what everyone else can do online. My other children’s schools, which shut down at the same time, have only started distance learning this week.

In the afternoon, my husband and I both work as best we can, while the children keep themselves busy. With guitars we had on hand and a drum set they built from scratch, they’re putting together a garage band. (Literally — they have to stay in the garage and can’t practice or perform anywhere else.) For the first time in my life, I’ve come to think that having four children sometimes can be less work than having one or two: They can entertain each other.

Counterintuitively, the days somehow end incredibly fast. We are always doing something: organizing lessons, fighting with a malfunctioning printer or about our overloaded WiFi, tutoring each child one-on-one, getting the kids outside, feeding them, drinking coffee, repeat. When, after two or three days, we can’t take the confinement anymore, one of us makes a run to the grocery store to buy fruits and vegetables and whatever else we need. (The stores, at least, are well stocked.) We go out by bike to get some exercise. That, too, is a challenge, because we are always tired.

My mother and sisters, my little niece, my aunt, and cousins live in Lombardy, the region worst affected by the pandemic. If my mother, who is 81 (or almost 81, as she would point out) catches this virus, she will probably die. I speak to and text them frequently, but I don’t know when, or if, I will be able to see them. It’s bizarre: Everyone is going through the same emotions — fear, anger, exhaustion — no matter where we live or what we do. We don’t need many words to know how the other person feels. We end every call with “Forza!” We must keep going.

An illustrated look at Italy now

Yes, most people who become ill will survive. Yes, people younger than 45 will probably be fine. But right now, doctors across Northern Italy have to choose between who gets the respirator and lives, and who does not and dies. Italy’s health system, for all its shortcomings — the long waits for certain tests, some aging buildings, the sometimes crowded hospital wards — is among the best-performing in the Western world. A 2017 report by the World Health Organization, for example, reported that Italian health care has among the lowest mortality rates in Europe and a strong acute-care sector. And yet this virus has overwhelmed the health system of one of the richest areas of the European Union.

Statistics change daily, as the hospitals scramble to build capacity. On Thursday, there were only 737 intensive-care beds open for new coronavirus patients in Lombardy; the region is home to 10 million people, and as of this writing, 16,220 people have tested positive for the disease there. Depending on how many coronavirus patients go into or out of the hospitals each day, if you have a chronic condition or a heart attack or are in a car crash, you might not be able to access care.

Writing this from Italy, I am also writing to you from your own future. From our state of emergency, we have been watching the crisis unfold in the United States with a terrible sense of foreboding. Please stop waiting for others to tell you what to do; stop blaming the government for doing too much or too little. We all have actions we can take to slow the spread of the disease — and ensuring that your own household has enough canned goods and cleaning supplies is not enough. You can do a lot more. You should do a lot more. Stay away from restaurants, gyms, libraries, movie theaters, bars and cafes, yes. But also: Don’t invite people over for dinner, don’t let your kids go on playdates, don’t take them to the playground, don’t let your teenagers out of your sight. They will sneak out with their friends, they will hold hands, they will share their drinks and food. If this seems too much, consider the following: We are not allowed to hold weddings or funerals. We can’t gather to bury our dead.

For us, it might be too late to avoid an incredible loss of life. But if you decide against taking actions because it seems inconvenient, or because you don’t want to look silly, you can’t say you weren’t warned."

"" Officials at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and epidemic experts from universities around the world conferred last month about what might happen if the new [coronavirus](https://www.nytimes.com/live/2020/coronavirus-update-03-13) gained a foothold in the United States. How many people might die? How many would be infected and need hospitalization?

One of the agency’s top disease modelers, Matthew Biggerstaff, presented the group on the phone call with four possible scenarios — A, B, C and D — based on characteristics of the virus, including estimates of how transmissible it is and the severity of the illness it can cause. The assumptions, reviewed by The New York Times, were shared with about 50 expert teams to model how the virus could tear through the population — and what might stop it.

The C.D.C.’s scenarios were depicted in terms of percentages of the population. Translated into absolute numbers by independent experts using simple models of how viruses spread, the worst-case figures would be staggering if no actions were taken to slow transmission.

Between 160 million and 214 million people in the United States could be infected over the course of the epidemic, according to a projection that encompasses the range of the four scenarios. That could last months or even over a year, with infections concentrated in shorter periods, staggered across time in different communities, experts said. As many as 200,000 to 1.7 million people could die."""

WASHINGTON — A federal government plan to combat the coronavirus warned policymakers last week that a pandemic “will last 18 months or longer” and could include “multiple waves,” resulting in widespread shortages that would strain consumers and the nation’s health care system.

The 100-page plan, dated Friday, the same day President Trump declared a national emergency, laid out a grim prognosis for the spread of the virus and outlined a response that would activate agencies across the government and potentially employ special presidential powers to mobilize the private sector.

Among the “additional key federal decisions” listed among the options for Mr. Trump was invoking the Defense Production Act of 1950, a Korean War-era law that authorizes a president to take extraordinary action to force American industry to ramp up production of critical equipment and supplies such as ventilators, respirators and protective gear for health care workers.

“Shortages of products may occur, impacting health care, emergency services, and other elements of critical infrastructure,” the plan warned. “This includes potentially critical shortages of diagnostics, medical supplies (including PPE and pharmaceuticals), and staffing in some locations.” P.P.E. refers to personal protective equipment.

The plan continued: “State and local governments, as well as critical infrastructure and communications channels, will be stressed and potentially less reliable. These stresses may also increase the challenges of getting updated messages and coordinating guidance to these jurisdictions directly.”

The plan, which was unclassified but marked “For Official Use Only // Not For Public Distribution or Release,” was shared with The New York Times as Mr. Trump escalated his efforts to curb the spread of the virus. After weeks of playing down the seriousness of the pandemic, saying it would miraculously disappear, Mr. Trump began shifting to a more sober tone during a news conference on Friday announcing the national emergency.

Much of the plan is bureaucratic in nature, describing coordination among agencies and actions that in some cases have already been taken, like urging schools to close and large events to be canceled. But its discussion of the Defense Production Act came as lawmakers and others urged Mr. Trump to invoke its powers.

“While the administration’s response has so far lacked the urgency this crisis has called for, there are still steps you can take to mitigate the damage,” Senator Bob Menendez, Democrat of New Jersey, wrote in a letter to Mr. Trump on Tuesday. “Invoking the powers vested in the DPA will enable the federal government to step up and take the type of aggressive steps needed in this time of uncertainty.”

Another letter sent last week by 57 House Democrats led by Representative Andy Levin of Michigan made similar points: “During World War II, our country adapted to the demands of the time to produce mass quantities of bombers, tanks, and many smaller items needed to save democracy and freedom in the world. We know what the demands of this time are, and we must act now to meet these demands.”
Senator Jack Reed, Democrat of Rhode Island, said that Defense Secretary Mark T. Esper told him on Tuesday that the Pentagon would provide federal health workers with five million respirator masks and 2,000 specialized ventilators. “The American public is on wartime footing in terms of battling the spread of this disease, and the Pentagon has to be part of the effort to help protect the health and safety of the American people,” Mr. Reed said.

But Mr. Trump said on Tuesday that he was not ready to invoke the Defense Production Act. “We’re able to do that if we have to,” he told reporters. “Right now, we haven’t had to, but it’s certainly ready. If I want it, we can do it very quickly. We’ve studied it very closely over two weeks ago, actually. We’ll make that decision pretty quickly if we need it. We hope we don’t need it. It’s a big step.”

Passed in 1950 shortly after American troops went to war defending South Korea against an invasion from North Korea, the Defense Production Act was based on powers used during World War II and authorized the president to require businesses to prioritize and accept contracts necessary for national defense.

Over the years, its scope has been expanded to include domestic preparedness and national emergencies. A president can make direct loans or loan guarantees and purchase commitments, subsidies or other incentives to influence industry to help in times of crisis.

Other key decisions outlined as options for the president include distributing medical supplies and equipment from the Strategic National Stockpile, providing money to states to help them meet demands caused by the coronavirus outbreak and prioritizing the distribution of essential resources to focus on areas most in need.

“The spread and severity of Covid-19 will be difficult to forecast and characterize,” the government plan said. It warned of “significant shortages for government, private sector, and individual U.S. consumers.”"

2020-03-17,Midnightapalooza,Anxiety,39,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/eupik4/coronavirus_megathread/fkss5ea/,"Hello hello everyone! Hope you’re all doing as well as you possibly can be today, and hopefully by the time you’re done reading today’s news and information, you’ll be feeling even better! Let’s get this train rolling. 

We’re going to look at the Diamond Princess again today, and before we do, I would like to explain why this situation is so perfect for epidemiological study. If you’ve been reading my posts, you’ve probably seen me mention the phrase “perfect conditions” once or twice. Let me tell you: there is almost no condition more perfect for rapid disease spread than there is on a cruise ship. We’re looking at close quarters, recirculated air, surfaces like handrails, elevator buttons, doorknobs being touched by potentially thousands of people per day- and of course, everyone’s relaxed and maybe not stressing too much about hygiene. Few, if any of these people, were washing their hands or disinfecting surfaces the way that all of us here (and millions of other people globally) likely are. 

Even with this being the case, only 17% of all people on board the ship tested positive, and that statistic as well as all facts on this topic come from [this recent, fantastic, positive study](https://www.eurosurveillance.org/content/10.2807/1560-7917.ES.2020.25.10.2000180#html_fulltext). Out of 3,711 people on board, a cumulative total of 634 tested positive. Here’s where things get even more interesting: of that  total of 634, 320 of them were *asymptomatic*. 

Let’s talk a little bit about what this means. First of all, I would like to remind everyone of Marc Lipsitch and his current estimation of the global population getting infected. I’d link it if I could but it’s a twitter link which gets blocked, but if you google his name and the statistic 20-60%, you should find his tweet where he claims that he estimates 20-60% of all adults on the planet will get infected in approximately a year’s time. I want to clarify- this is the guy who originally estimated that to be 40-70%, and after new findings showed that the rate of infection might be lower than previously thought, he revised his estimation. Additionally, the high end there is a “worst case, what if no one in the world does anything to stop this” scenario. If you see anyone claiming the 70% statistic, you can shoot them down with this fact. 

Anyways, two major conclusions I want to draw here. The 20% estimate seems to be in line with the cruise ship, where 17% of passengers were confirmed positive, despite those perfect conditions I mentioned above. On a global scale then, scaling things up and accounting for mistakes and unique scenarios and all of the imperfections of the real world, the lower end of that 20-60% number seems even more feasible. 

Second, **over 50% of the cases were asymptomatic.** This is *huge* news. For one thing, even if you’re asymptomatic, you will most likely still develop at least a short term immunity to the virus- when you fight it off, you won’t get it again or spread it. Combine this with a study I linked a few days ago which indicates that those who are recovering are either not contagious or dramatically less contagious, and our concerns for asymptomatic transmission are reduced even further. 

Lastly on this topic, here’s a quote from the study: *“Currently, there is no clear evidence that COVID-19 asymptomatic persons can transmit SARS-CoV-2, but there is accumulating evidence indicating that a substantial fraction of SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals are asymptomatic”.* According to this study, asymptomatic transmission may not be a *major* concern. Of course, it does state that there is “currently no clear evidence”, so this is subject to change, and we should not take the risk of spreading it if we are asymptomatic. Anyone who comes in contact with the virus should still self-isolate for 14 days, but on a broad scale- this is amazing news. I’m summarizing all of this to the best of my ability because I want to cover more, so please, *ask questions if I didn’t clarify anything here enough*.

This package includes $250 billion for small businesses and $500 billion for individual citizens- they’re looking to either cut payroll taxes or send direct checks to all adults. Combined with various [ISPs pledging not to suspend service](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.axios.com/isps-promise-fcc-they-wont-shut-off-service-during-pandemic-eec76a46-61a8-4673-a8a9-981ead4094c3.html) and companies all across the country pledging not to suspend utilities or evict people for not being able to pay rent (I’d post links but it’s a state-by-state thing- look for your state’s recent announcements to see if you will benefit from this), money should hopefully be less of a concern for most Americans in the coming weeks. If your state has not announced any such plans or policies, don’t lose hope, it’s likely to happen.

We don’t need to prove that it’s safe for human consumption if these are already FDA approved, we just need to do trials to prove that it’s effective and safe treatment for this specific virus. These drugs will *hopefully*, therefore, be in use relatively soon, quite likely sooner than the vaccine. Speaking of the vaccine...

-[The first patients to receive a Coronavirus vaccine were injected **today**!!!](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.cbsnews.com/amp/news/coronavirus-vaccine-jennifer-haller-seattle-first-patient-injected-with-covid-19-shot-in-clinical-trial-cure/) Of course, this is an early step, clinical trials won’t be done for a while still, but this is a major milestone and, if all goes well with this, we should be very well on our way to getting the vaccine in circulation relatively soon! According to Dr. Fauci, these phase one trials began with record speed. 

I want to clarify “high-risk” populations. First of all, I want to apologize just in case I’ve ever indicated to anyone that someone who is “high-risk” is in any way doomed, or if you’ve ever felt like the discussion of “high-risk” people feels a bit… cold, like the high-risk folks don’t matter as much as the general population. 

What we need to remember is that the term “high-risk” encompasses a spectrum- not everyone in the high-risk category is equally at-risk. For example- a 90 year old smoker vs. an 80 year old never-smoker. Both are high risk. One is clearly high*er* risk. 

Additionally, highest risk tends to encompass those with *untreated* underlying conditions. If you have diabetes or hypertension, but you monitor that condition and follow your treatment plan, your risk is significantly minimized. It’s when these conditions become *uncontrolled* that the risk develops. So- if you’re reading this and you have one of those conditions, or something similarly risky, your diagnosis is *not* a death sentence. Just follow your treatment plan and your risk is minimized. 

If you have asthma (like me!), COPD, or severe allergies, don’t fear- nothing has conclusively proven those to be significant risk factors and in fact, [this study](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32077115/) reports that those conditions are *”not risk factors”*. 

This feels scary because it feels uncontrollable, but what we fail to remember is that it **is** controllable. The WHO has stated that this is the first pandemic to ever be containable. But in order to do that, the most power is *in our hands*. This isn’t out of our control. This is fought with logic, with reason, with rationality. It’s fought with science and facts. It’s fought with actions that *you* can take *right now.*

Flatten the curve! Stay the fuck home! Wash your hands! Do everything you can do to fight this. Spread the word. We *can* and we *will* fight this. We *will* get through this, together. Remember to be alert, not anxious. This is not the end of the world. We won’t let it be. We’ve survived everything we’ve ever been through, and we **will** survive this too. 

As always, take the optimism, take the good news, and use it as momentum to move forward. We’ve got this, guys. It’s going to be alright. I love you all and I will see you again tomorrow. 

In case you need more momentum, here’s my [post from yesterday](http://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/eupik4/coronavirus_megathread/fkpi8jv)- links to all the old ones are at the bottom of that one. Can’t include them here because I’m right at the character limit- already had to cut several paragraphs!

2020-03-17,Scratchjackson,Coronavirus,36,https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/fkgsbo/a_chilling_scientific_paper_helped_upend_us_and/fksmpkc/," LONDON  — Immediately after Boris Johnson completed his Monday evening news  conference, which saw a somber prime minister encourage his fellow  citizens to avoid ""all nonessential contact with others,"" his aides  hustled reporters into a second, off-camera briefing.

That session  presented jaw-dropping numbers from some of Britain’s top modelers of  infectious disease, who predicted the deadly course of the [coronavirus](https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2020/02/28/what-you-need-know-about-coronavirus/?tid=lk_inline_manual_3&itid=lk_inline_manual_3)  could quickly kill hundreds of thousands in both the United Kingdom and  the United States, as surges of sick and dying patients overwhelmed  hospitals and critical care units.

The [new forecasts,](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/media/imperial-college/medicine/sph/ide/gida-fellowships/Imperial-College-COVID19-NPI-modelling-16-03-2020.pdf)  by Neil Ferguson and his colleagues at the Imperial College COVID-19  Response Team, were quickly endorsed by Johnson’s government to design  new and more extreme measures to suppress the spread of the virus.

The  report is also influencing planning by the Trump administration.  Deborah Birx, who serves as the coordinator of the White House  coronavirus task force, cited the British analysis at a news conference  Monday, saying her response team was especially focused on the report’s  conclusion that an entire household should self-quarantine for 14 days  if one of its members is stricken by the virus.

The Imperial  College London group reported that if nothing was done by governments  and individuals and the pandemic remained uncontrolled, 510,000 would  die in Britain and 2.2 million in the United States over the course of  the outbreak.

These kinds of numbers are deeply concerning for  countries with top-drawer health-care systems. They are terrifying for  less-developed countries, global health experts say.

If Britain  and the United States pursued more-ambitious measures to mitigate the  spread of the coronavirus, to slow but not necessarily stop the epidemic  over the coming few months, they could reduce mortality by half, to  260,000 people in the United Kingdom and 1.1 million in the United  States.

Finally, if the British government quickly went all-out to  suppress viral spread — aiming to reverse epidemic growth and reduce  the case load to a low level — then the number of dead in the country  could drop to below 20,000. To do this, the researchers said, Britain  would have to enforce social distancing for the entire population,  isolate all cases, demand quarantines of entire households where anyone  is sick, and close all schools and universities — and do this not for  weeks but for 12 to 18 months, until a vaccine is available.

“We might be living in a very different world for a year or more,” Ferguson told reporters.

The modelers did not give numbers for the United States for the most intense suppression efforts.

The  researchers reminded governments that these forecasts are based on  current observed trends in China, South Korea, Britain and Italy but  that much remains unknown about the virus.

The Imperial College  report, which was shared with the British government over the weekend  ahead of its official release Monday, was responsible in large part for  Johnson’s turnaround decision to begin rolling out what 10 Downing  Street described as life-altering, “drastic” measures to control the  spread of the novel coronavirus, aides said.

Johnson said the  virus “would overwhelm any health system in the world” if quarantines  and limits on social contact are not taken. “Although the measures we  have already announced are extreme, we may have to go further in the  coming days,” the prime minister said Tuesday.

[Johnson urged his fellow citizens](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/europe/uk-coronavirus-herd-immunity/2020/03/16/1c9d640e-66c7-11ea-b199-3a9799c54512_story.html?tid=lk_inline_manual_22&itid=lk_inline_manual_22) to immediately start to avoid “all nonessential contact with others,” work from home and self-  
isolate  now if they are elderly or suffer from underlying medical conditions.  The measures are still voluntary, but Johnson warned that his government  had the power to make them mandatory.

Johnson said that healthy  and asymptomatic Britons should avoid pubs, clubs and theaters. In  London, the bars were still open Monday. Most schools, museums and  restaurants were, too. But the prime minister said closing schools was  “under consideration.”

Roy Anderson, an infectious disease  specialist at Imperial College, who was not a part of the study, said  Britain probably had much more to do. “I don’t know if these measures  are enough yet,” he said. “And I wish we had done them last week.”

If Britain had continued on the go-slow, step-by-step course that [it set just days ago](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/europe/flatten-the-curve-coronavirus/2020/03/12/a648883c-6460-11ea-8a8e-5c5336b32760_story.html?tid=lk_inline_manual_28&itid=lk_inline_manual_28),  the Imperial College modeling envisioned hundreds of thousands of  deaths and a tidal wave of cases that would overwhelm the National  Health Service and its hospitals. There are currently 7,000 ventilators  available for all of England, the largest nation within the United  Kingdom, with a population of 56 million.

The British forecast  also influenced thinking at the White House. On Monday evening in  Washington, President Trump said that Americans should avoid gathering  in groups of more than 10 people, eating in restaurants or taking  nonessential trips — [his most significant push yet](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/coronavirus-trump-avoid-gatherings/2020/03/16/3af817a2-67b0-11ea-b313-df458622c2cc_story.html?tid=lk_inline_manual_29&itid=lk_inline_manual_29) to combat a viral outbreak.

At  a news conference Monday at the White House, Birx said her group has  been working with modelers around the globe, including in Britain.

“So,  we had new information coming out from a model, and what had the  biggest impact in the model is social distancing, small groups, not  going in public in large groups. But the most important thing was if one  person in the household became infected, the whole household  self-quarantined for 14 days. Because that stops 100 percent of the  transmission outside of the household,” she said.

To suppress  spread in Britain, widespread school and university closings might also  be necessary, though Ferguson worried about its impact on staffing at  NHS hospitals, where as many as a third of nurses have school-age  children, the Guardian newspaper reported.

In their forecast, the  modelers envision that strict measures over the coming months will  occasionally be loosened, but as soon as they are, viral spread could  come roaring back.

“The major challenge of suppression is that  this type of intensive intervention package . . . will need to be  maintained until a vaccine becomes available (potentially 18 months or  more), given that we predict that transmission will quickly rebound if  interventions are relaxed,” the study concludes.

“Intermittent  social distancing — triggered by trends in disease surveillance — may  allow interventions to be relaxed temporarily in relatively short time  windows, but measures will need to be reintroduced if or when case  numbers rebound,” the research team said."

&#x200B;

**Shortest tl;dr:** SARS and COVID-19 infect via some shit called ACE-2 enzyme - they bind to cells because they stick to this shit. Diabetic medication, some blood pressure medication and ibuprofen increase this shit. It **could** (not does, but **could**) explain why people with diabetes and hypertension can have more serious infections. This data is why some drs (NHS also) are saying perhaps take Tylenol for a while instead of Ibuprofen. **BUT WAIT!!!** this shit is complicated, because ACE-2 also protects against lung damage and you need it. So delivered the right way (they're testing via injection mode) might help combat lung damage. We don't know enough yet.

Conclusion: don't panic, don't change any meds without express permission from doctor, just be aware, information is power. Only switch ibuprofen with tylenol/paracetamol for now, if you can.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Slightly more detailed tl;dr:** Human pathogenic coronaviruses (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus \[SARS-CoV\] and SARSCoV-2) bind to their target cells through angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which is expressed by epithelial cells of the lung, intestine, kidney, and blood vessels.

Comorbidities reported so far for severe coronavirus patients include hypertension and either type I or type II diabetes. These patients are often being treated with ACE-1 inhibitors or angiotensin-receptor antagonists. The tricky part is that both diabetes itself and treatment with either of those drug classes ***increases the expression of ACE-2 protein, which could explain why diabetics and those with hypertension can have more serious infections***. Ibuprofen also increases ACE-2, which is why some doctors are skeptical of how beneficial taking it could be, and recommend switching to acetaminophen/tylenol/paracetamol **until we know more**.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Not at all tl;dr, for those who enjoy reading a lot:**

I fell down this hole in my research trying to find out more about **why Ibuprofen** is causing such an uproar right now, with doctors saying to switch to Paracetamol/Tylenol while there not being enough data to know for sure if it's harmful.

A paper released this week in the journal Pediatrics, based on 2,143 young people in China, provides the most extensive evidence on the spread of the virus in children, and there is bad news and good news.
The study provides confirmation that coronavirus infections are in fact generally less severe in kids, with more than 90 percent having mild to moderate disease or even being asymptomatic. But it contains worrisome information about one subset — infants — and suggests that children may be a critical factor in the disease’s rapid spread.
AD

The first thing to know is that children are getting infected across all age groups and genders. Among the patients studied, half were from Hubei Province, the epicenter of the outbreak, while the others were from bordering areas. They ranged in age from newborns to 18 with the median age being 7 years.
So what does coronavirus look like in children?
Surge in coronavirus patients threatens to swamp U.S. hospitals

According to the analysis by Shanghai Children’s Medical Center researchers Yuanyuan Dong, Xi Mo and co-authors, mild cases (52 percent) were marked by the typical symptoms of a cold — fever, fatigue, cough, sore throat, runny nose and sneezing. Some patients had no fever and only digestive symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain and diarrhea.
AD

Those with moderate infection (39 percent) had pneumonia with frequent fever and cough, mostly dry cough, followed by a wetter cough. Some had wheezing but no obvious shortness of breath.
Severe cases were rare (5 percent) as were those who required critical care (0.4 percent.) The severe cases began with early respiratory symptoms which were sometimes accompanied by gastrointestinal issues. Around one week the children have more difficulty breathing. Those cases sometimes quickly progressed to critical illness with acute respiratory distress or failure which in turn sometimes led to other organ dysfunction — heart failure or kidney injury.
One boy, a 14-year-old, died on Feb. 7. No further details on the patient were revealed in the study.
AD

Of special interest to pediatricians is a group of seven infants (11 percent of the total number of infants in the study), and two children in the age 1 to 5 range (15 percent), who progressed to critical condition. The study suggests, the authors wrote, that “young children, particularly infants, were vulnerable.”
The luckiest group — 4 percent — did not have any symptoms at all even as nasal or throat swabs showed they were positive for coronavirus infection.
“Why most of the children’s COVID-19 cases were less severe than adults’ case is puzzling,” Dong and Mo wrote. “This may be related to both exposure and host factors.""
The researchers wrote that children may have been more isolated at home after the outbreak began, and therefore had fewer opportunities to be exposed to the pathogens. They also suggested that there was something in the children’s biology — a cell receptor that binds to the virus — that might be less sensitive. Another theory is that children often experience colds and other respiratory infections in winter so they may have come into the season with higher levels of antibodies, which are protective, than adults.
AD

The Pediatrics editors wrote they were releasing the paper early, within days of it having been peer reviewed but before official publication, due to the topic’s importance. In a commentary accompanying the study, associate editors Andrea Cruz and Steve Zeichner, both physicians, say the study suggests “children may play a major role in community-based viral transmission.”
The data suggests they may have more symptoms that make them contagious, like runny nose, and that they may have more gastrointestinal symptoms which raises concerns for the virus being in the feces for several weeks after infection.

As schools move to online teaching, students will be spending extra time in front of a screen. Clinical psychologist Nicole Beurkens has some pointers. (Allie Caren/The Washington Post)
“Prolonged shedding in nasal secretions and stool has substantial implications for community spread in day-care centers, schools, and in the home,” Cruz, a pediatrician from the Baylor College of Medicine, and Zeichner, an immunologist from the University of Virginia, wrote.
AD

Adam Ratner, a doctor in pediatric infectious diseases at NYU Langone Health, said the outbreak in China represents only a small percentage of those who will eventually become infected and when the group gets larger “we’ll see more serious cases on the fringes.”
He said the clear takeaway from the study is that coronavirus “is still something that has the ability to cause severe disease across the age spectrum.” He said his hospital and his colleagues’ around the United States were “taking the idea of covid-19 in children very seriously.”
“We’re learning more and more about this disease every day for better or for worse,” he said. “It’s still very early days.”"

2020-03-17,Viewfromthe31stfloor,Coronavirus,29,https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/fkgfxb/children_and_coronavirus_research_finds_some/fksk75w/,"“A study of more than 2,000 children with the virus in China found that babies were especially vulnerable to developing severe infection.”

Now, the largest study to date of children and the virus has found that while most develop mild or moderate symptoms, a small percentage — especially babies and preschoolers — can become seriously ill.

The study, published online in the journal Pediatrics, looked at more than 2,000 ill children across China, where the pandemic began. It provides a clearer portrait of how the youngest patients are affected by the virus, knowledge that experts say can help influence policies like school closures, hospital preparedness and the deployment of an eventual treatment and vaccine.

The researchers analyzed 2,143 cases of children under 18 that were reported to the Chinese Centers for Disease Control and Prevention as of Feb. 8. Just over a third of those cases were confirmed with laboratory testing. The rest were classified as suspected cases based on the child’s symptoms, chest X-rays, blood tests and whether the child had been exposed to people with coronavirus.


“About half of the children had mild symptoms, such as fever, fatigue, cough, congestion and possibly nausea or diarrhea. More than a third — about 39 percent — became moderately sick, with additional symptoms including pneumonia or lung problems revealed by CT scan, but with no obvious shortness of breath. About 4 percent had no symptoms at all.

But there were 125 children — nearly 6 percent— who developed very serious illness, and one 14-year-old boy with confirmed coronavirus infection died, said Shilu Tong, the study’s senior author, who is director of the department of clinical epidemiology and biostatistics at Shanghai Children’s Medical Center. Thirteen of those were considered “critical,"" on the brink of respiratory or organ failure. The others were classified as “severe” because they had dire respiratory problems.

“Effectively, what this tells us is that hospitals should prepare for some pediatric patients because we can’t rule out children altogether,” said Dr. Srinivas Murthy, an associate professor of pediatrics at the University of British Columbia, who was not involved in the study.”

“The main conclusion,” Dr. Murthy continued, “is that children are infected at rates that may be comparable to adults, with severity that’s much less, but that even within the kids, there’s a spectrum of illness and there’s a handful that require more aggressive therapy.”

More than 60 percent of the 125 children who became severely ill or critically ill were age 5 or younger, the study reported. Forty of those were infants, under 12 months old.

Dr. Tong said he believed that younger children were more susceptible to infection because their respiratory systems and other body functions are rapidly developing.

Dr. Andrea Cruz, an associate professor of pediatrics of Baylor College of Medicine and co-author of a commentary about the study, said that preschoolers and babies likely get sicker because of their “immune system immaturity.”

“They haven’t been exposed to viruses before and therefore they can’t mount an effective immune response,” she said in an interview.

Scientists are actively trying to determine why so many children appear to emerge relatively unscathed by the new coronavirus, a pattern that also characterized the earlier outbreaks of the closely-related SARS virus in China and MERS in the Middle East. Cases of children with the new coronavirus infection in Italy, Singapore and South Korea seem to be similar, Dr. Murthy said.

[Like the Science Times page on Facebook. | Sign up for the Science Times newsletter.]

A theory that is gaining increasing currency is that the receptor or protein in human cells that the viral particles bind to, called the ACE2 receptor, is not expressed as prominently in young children or might be a different shape, Dr. Murthy said.

“It might not be as developed in children as in adults,” he said, which might make it tougher for the spikes on the tiny viral particles to bind and gain entry to the cells so the virus can replicate.

Another theory is that “most kids have healthier lungs” than adults, Dr. Cruz said. Adults have likely been more exposed to pollution over their lifetime and adults with severe coronavirus disease have tended to have underlying health conditions or weakened or aging immune systems.

It’s also possible, experts say, that children’s immune systems don’t rev up to attack the virus as much as adult immune systems do. Doctors have found that some of the serious damage infected adults have endured has been caused not just by the virus itself, but by an aggressive immune response that creates destructive inflammation in the body’s organs.

The new study, while large and included cases across China, not just where the outbreak originated in Wuhan, leaves many unanswered questions. For example, the researchers found that more of the severe and critical cases were in children with suspected — instead of confirmed — coronavirus infection, raising the possibility that other infections wreaked havoc on their bodies, in addition to or possibly even instead of Covid-19.

It’s also unclear whether the United States can expect the relatively small numbers of child cases reported in China or should brace for more.

“The age pyramid in China is really different than the U.S. — they have a lot fewer kids than we do,” said Dr. Cruz, who believes, as other experts do, that large numbers of people with mild or asymptomatic disease have not been recorded because testing was not done in those cases. “You’ve had a lot of under-testing in children because the focus has been on adults. It’s likely we’ve been underestimating the disease burden in kids.”

Answering questions about coronavirus in children could reverberate well beyond the pediatric population. It could shed light why some patients are most at risk. And, said Dr. Murthy, studying the physiology of those who are less affected could help in the development of treatment and a vaccine.

For one of the first times on a big up day, instead of everything moving up together by similar percentages, we saw quality stocks substantially outperform coronavirus affected stocks (Boeing, cruise, airlines etc.).

On these types of up days the past week, we often saw the coronavirus affected stocks get a big bump too, but there wasn't much of that today.  Investors/algs were a lot more picky today.

I do think we're approaching A bottom over the next 2 weeks; VIX is basically as high as it can reasonably go, and we've bounced near the Dec. 2018 lows.  I think we'll see a lot more stabilization if we see a big stimulus package from Congress, since that would boost sentiment substantially.

The question of whether this would be THE bottom depends on the next 2 months, if coronavirus really escalates out of control in the US and we end up in a longer than expected quagmire, then yeah we could see another big selloff and retest of the first upcoming bottom.  I think we see a lot of sideways movement until we get to the other side of the parabolic growth curve of the virus.  That's probably when we see more of a final push out of this bear market, but even then it's tough to see anything like a straight line back up to S&P 3400 any time in the next 12 months.

New job called today and rescinded the offer because their entire office is WFH at the moment and it doesn't make sense to start him in 2 weeks. They said for him to expect a phone call from the president to talk further about the whole thing and they're going to give him 1 months pay to make up for everything. So now he's had to go back to his current boss and basically beg to be able to stay on for who knows how long. What a mess. I'm hoping that the new job is like ""we still really want you and we're going to bring you in but we just don't know when"" instead of just pulling back altogether. Also really fucking hoping his current job lets him stay since they haven't processed any of his resignation paperwork yet.

Update: New job has completely rescinded the offer saying they probably won't look to fill this position now for \~6 months since this mess has rocked them as it has most other businesses. UGHHHHHHHH"

Norway’s Unemployment Jumps 128% in only one week, making the unemployment rate in this country highest since 1995.

Don't wanna be a neg, but we are probably just at the tip of a domino fall that this black swan has brought us, and once shit hits the fan, things are going south. Real south.

I don't think a lot of us have yet to understand the full devastation that the novel virus plus the wildly hyper-elated economic period in the past few years are going to have on our daily life. Fed is on full on panic mode, and our interest rate is at 0%, yet there's virtually no way in calming the market. Casinos, hotels and airlines are begging to be bailed out, trillions of government debt, etc. Most businesses who have been living paycheck by paycheck, are in danger with the amounting cash problems, huge costs, while generating virtually no revenues.

Look at the math.  Look at the graphs.  Look at other countries experience.  [Look at this interactive graph](https://www.nytimes.com./interactive/2020/03/13/opinion/coronavirus-trump-response.html).  

#***Please take 5 minutes, and look at the math below:***

Virologists and Epidemiologists from Harvard and John's Hopkins are saying that anywhere from 40% to 60% of the population of the US will contract COVID19.

They also say, and you can see from other countries, that roughly 5-6% need ventilators.

Let's use low-end and say 40% of the US contracts COVID19 and 5% of those need ventilators.

40% x 327,000,000 (pop of US) = 130,800,000 will contract COVID19 on the low-end.

5% of those cases (5% x 130,800,000) = 6,540,000 will need ventilators.

The USA has about 170,000 ventilators, with roughly 200,000 in the national stockpile. This is roughly 370,000 ventilators nation-wide.

We all know there are people nation wide that are currently on ventilators. I don't know how many, so let's just assume for the math, that EVERY SINGLE VENTILATOR IN THE COUNTRY is available, even though this definitely isn't true:

6,540,000 people who need ventilators - 370,000 available ventilators = 6,170,000.

#Left with NO CONTAINMENT and no additional supply of ventilators from other countries, this virus WOULD HAVE killed roughly 6,170,000 people by the end of it, on the low-end, JUST from the lack of ventilators.

So we're supposedly social distancing right now (even though I see people at the bars, and out and about everywhere). Let's take that into account:

Say we're actually doing some good with our social distancing, and it removes 4/5 of every case.

(1/5) x 6,170,000 = 

#If our hospitals are over run, roughly 1,234,000 people that will die from this disease this year, ONLY from lack of ventilators...and this assumes every ventilator in the country is available currently. On the low end.

#...and that's even if our ""social distancing"" is removing 4/5 of the infected possibilities.

...and this isn't even mentioning the people who need hospital beds, but DON'T need ventilators.

You may not like to hear it, and frankly neither do I, but it's time to hunker down. Nation wide.

>Studies analyzing the 1918-1919 Spanish Influenza showed cities that closed their schools earlier also had lower death rates (see figure). For instance, St. Louis closed its schools proactively and experienced a 2.2 percent death rate. Pittsburgh, on the other hand, waited until the peak of the crisis to close its schools and experienced a death rate **nearly three times higher.**

Also, this complete bullshit about ""we need nurses and doctors to be able to keep working"" - yes. The government *should* put measures in place immediately to ensure critical workers can keep working. Fund private in-home childcare for those students. But if we don't act now, if we don't close schools, hospitals are going to be overwhelmed. Doctors are nurses are not going to be able to cope with the influx of patients we will see.

In Italy, hospitals have had to turn away patients over 60 - refusing ventilators, because there aren't enough to go around. Italy's hospitals are drowning. We *need* to flatten the curve.

Meanwhile, Morrison is more interested in attending Hillsong conferences than doing what has to be done. 

He's planning stimulus measures that won't be available to workers for weeks (up to late April), instead of fighting to safeguard jobs, and ensure casual workers don't lose incomes *now*. To close government offices now. To close restaurants now. To protect vital infrastructure, and ensure power and water can keep running. To ensure vital supplies like fucking food can keep flowing *now* (this is obviously going to take some degree of government help). To put a hold on mortgages and rents and other bills to cushion the blow and avoid bankruptcies, as countries like Canada and France are doing. To reduce social contact *now*. To coordinate widespread testing *now* - something that appears to be helping reduce the spread of infection in other countries. He is squandering the very narrow window we have to save lives, when every day counts.

2020-03-17,JanetYellensFuckboy,neoliberal,22,https://www.reddit.com/r/neoliberal/comments/fk0szf/discussion_thread/fksz6uw/,"Really greatly insightful and well-written comment from a Warren supporter in r/politics, thought it worth sharing:

>As a proud Warren voter, here’s my case for Biden (and I’m not particularly thrilled about it, but I have spent several months coming to a cosmic comfort level with the concept of a Biden presidency, so I can make a pretty good pitch):

>* Apart from Warren, Biden is the only candidate that has the knowledge to and understands the importance of rebuilding the government and administrative state in a post-Trump world. Besides her, he’s the one that understands the depth of the problem and how much work it’s going to take to fix it. Our State Department has been decimated. Multiple cabinet posts and undersecretaries are being manned by ‘acting’ employees. There’s been a mass exodus of career staffers and government employees. We're seeing the sad results of it with how the CDC is incapable, underfunded, and unequipped to deal with the coronavirus pandemic.

>   * And no one seems to want to talk about the massive institutional knowledge loss that has happened under Trump except Warren and Biden. Bernie doesn’t seem to particularly understand the problem or have the patience to fix it. Bernie wants to talk policy without realizing how hard it’s going to be to re-staff, reorganize, restructure, and restore what’s been lost since 2016, much less accomplish anything more than that within four years. Biden will be able to fix this.

>* I trust him to pick competent people to surround himself with. Like…that’s it. That’s the reason. Bernie hires people like Nina Turner and David Sirota. Biden hires Kurt Bagley, Symone Sanders, and TJ Ducklo. But more than that, Biden will have a wealth of intelligent, competent, and qualified people BEGGING to serve in his administration. Bernie Sanders will not. Biden will inevitably pick competent people, but Bernie’s staffing choices this entire primary season has not inspired a lick of confidence in me that he will do the same. And, as Warren says, “personnel is policy.” The people you surround yourself with and defer to influence how you go about trying to make policy, and just because a person supports a certain set of policies does not mean they will be effective at enacting change around those issues. 

>* More importantly for me as a voter, just because we share a set of preferred policy goals does not mean I believe Bernie Sanders is anywhere near the best person to lead the passage and implementation of those goals as President. Policy is not sentient. It requires actual human beings to pass and implement….human beings that are competent at building alliances built across differing opinions. Bernie Sanders and his “movement” will **never** be able to accomplish that. A Biden administration with Warren and the progressive movement being an absolute *pain in his ass* and holding him accountable? Just might.

>* Supreme Court and federal judicial picks. Biden understands what’s at stake there. He'll get at least two picks (RBG's replacement and probably Breyer's replacement). He’s spoken about it on numerous occasions. He's also promised to put a black woman on the court, and the perspective that said lived experience brings will be invaluable.

>* Peace and quiet. I'm so ridiculously mentally exhausted waking up every morning and wondering what scandal or controversy is going on now because Trump opened his big mouth. A Biden presidency will be a return to normalcy not in the way things function (because hopefully we will not only rebuild but also move forward in the process), but in the way political discourse happens: a return to professionalism, decorum, competence, and quiet leadership. This will be doubly true if we can manage to take out several Republicans (namely, McConnell, Lindsay Graham, Susan Collins, Martha McSally, etc) in the process.

>* Biden will inevitably be a single-term president; he will not run again as an 83-year-old. A single-term Biden caretaker presidency where he rebuilds the mess Trump left behind, maybe gets some positive change done, and bows out for a full system reboot in 2024 is not the end of the world. 

>Hope this helps some people come to a cosmic comfort level with voting for Biden tonight.

(Again, none of the above is my opinion; merely a well-worded opinion of a Warren supporter.)"

The test was administered on Saturday, Mr. Baraka said. When the authorities went to the address the woman had provided, they discovered that she did not live there.

“This woman is a public health risk to herself and to the entire community,” Mr. Baraka said. He asked the woman to return to the hospital or to contact her medical provider immediately.

“Because you gave a false name and because you gave a false address, you put yourself and many, many people at risk,” the mayor said, addressing the woman.

When Trump was elected, it was primed to keep growing under the promise of reduced taxes and more incentives to keep companies growing. But as Trump has deregulated time and time again, although letting the economy grow and grow, it removed certain assurances that these companies would be financially stable when the next dip happens. Well now that Coronavirus has struck this nation's and the world's economy (which Trump has done virtually nothing to mitigate until very recently) the markets are seeing that companies that have been riding high are drowning in debt to keep the unsustainable growth going and will likely default without customers buying their products. 

In short, the Trump administration inherited a recovering economy which they then helped boost. They can take credit for keeping the economy going in the direction it was already going but they cannot take credit for getting it started in that direction since they didn't. What they can take credit (or blame for) is the CURRENT trajectory since his poor planning against COVID19 and deregulation of the banks and economy and current monetary policy have sent the markets sinking.

2020-03-17,Drugs_and_Anarchy,nyu,20,https://www.reddit.com/r/nyu/comments/fkbcy6/update_to_moving_out/fkrtjjd/,"This update is such infuriating bullshit.

The WHO declared Coronavirus to be a world health issue at the end of *January.* What was NYU doing then? The first Coronavirus case in long island was March 5th, what was NYU doing then? The WHO declared Coronavirus a pandemic a week ago - *what was NYU doing then? Hoping for the best?*

You fucking cabbages, ***hope for the best, plan for the worst.*** They've known about this for months and decided to take no action, to plan for no eventualities, to do **nothing** proactive to help students and help themselves instead choosing to be entirely reactive to the situation. The smallest amount of forethought into this situation - ""hey what if things get really bad and we need to shut things down?"" - would have gone a long way. ***That this has become such an issue is entirely on the administration's shoulders for their months of inaction in the face of looming crisis.*** 

NYU is not alone in this situation. This has occurred in universities across the country that, rather than being responsible in regards to their student's health and their communities' health, decided to sit on their arses until the last possible minute when it became clear action would be necessary. Higher education in the United States is TOO GODDAMN EXPENSIVE for this to be the quality of administration we receive, for the administration to constantly make off-the-cuff decisions relying on their underpaid faculty to carry things out. 

Universities should *know* that they represent enormous disease outbreak risks, and have plans in place to deal with these events. I'm sure there are colleges that do have these plans, and who did follow them through, but NYU has made it very clear that they did not have these things in place beforehand. Their lack of attention to detail (did you seriously just *forget* to mention you only want people within one-day of New York to come get their things?) and their lack of communication (this clears up nothing really) says that they are making decisions as things come and that's fucking stupid.

Except - ""we thought more students would go home for Spring Break."" So, you were planning on this a week ago? Why would they be hoping for more students to be leaving for Spring Break if they had no idea what they'd be doing a week from now? They must have had *some* idea of what they might do, and they did not communicate their potential plans to *anyone* despite how much easier that could have made this transition. ***That survey should have been sent out a week ago.*** That's what I mean by they just rely on their faculty to handle the issues caused by their procrastination, whomever has to handle the volume of exceptions being requested has been given 48 hours to do so. I wonder if that was a decision made *with* the people who have to accomplish this, or if those people were just told out of nowhere they'd need to do this. 

***You can't guarantee the safety of people's things?*** You're going to turn the dorm into a makeshift hospital but you don't even have a plan in place to make sure people get their shit back because you cut them off with no notice? I'm sure that's going to go great, this administration has shown the clarity of thought and planning necessary to create a safe and effective makeshift hospital for a time of crisis. 

***You didn't expect people to stay in the dorms for Spring Break?*** With countries closed down? With **YOUR OWN DAMN ADVICE being to restrict travel to only what's necessary?** Students made the safe and responsible decision to remain in place out of your own, local, national, and international advice saying not to travel. Apparently NYU expected us to ignore all of that and do what we want, and we're being punished for it. 

Don't forget either - **We only got this much info out of them because we made a fuss.** They were perfectly happy to just leave us in the dark until we made it clear this was bullshit. Now they're scrambling to justify themselves but anyone with a modicum of critical thought can see straight through their bullshit.

This is not ok, and, in an extension of what I said earlier about university administrations across the country throwing students under the bus like this, I am calling for a nation-wide protest of University Administration's botched and reactive responses to a time of crisis. As I said, there should have already been plans in place to deal with outbreaks of disease. There should have been guidelines to follow which have room to adjust to unique circumstances. Even if these didn't exist, Universities had plenty of warning that they needed to develop them. This cannot be the level of quality we allow from the heads of higher education. This demands explanation, apology, and immediate action to reassure students that this will not happen again. 

Fuck man, they still expect me to move out by tomorrow night when *I have no clue where to move to?* This has done absolutely nothing to relieve my anxiety over my housing situation. Shouldn't that have been the point of this update?"

5 days leading up to it I felt like I'd gone too hard at the gym.

Day 1: this isnt so bad. 36.9 temp. Headache (4/10). Same shortness of breath (comparable to high altitude lack of oxygen, not bad and passes quickly). 

Day 2: Pretty unpleasant. Body feels like I have literally been hit by a bus. Every part of my body aches. My lungs feel bruised. 30% of the time I feel like I haven't got enough oxygen in me. Sore chest, cough starting to hurt. Headache is a permanent 7/10. Painkillers keeping it manageable. 

Day 3: went to bed at 10pm. Woke up at 1am ad didnt go back to sleep. Agony, confused, temperature is 40.3. Head is 9/10. 4pm as I'm writing this. Painkillers have fever symptoms kind of under control. It's the oxygen. I can breathe fine but it's like my lungs arent processing the oxygen. Temp is 38.9. Very uncomfortable. Lungs actually hurt.

“Coaches,

First and foremost, I hope you and your family are staying safe during this unprecedented time and know that we are thinking about all of you. 

Given the anxiety and information overload many of us are experiencing, it is understandable that we’re all looking to share ways we can help those around us stay healthy, especially as most of the people we know are now staying at home.   As a Beachbody Coach, it's a reflex to want to inspire and enable others to focus on their self-care, and share ways they can maintain or even start working on their physical fitness while they’re spending most of their time at home. It's especially compelling with gyms and most public fitness options closed.  Like you, we are very proud that Beachbody On Demand is a perfect alternative. We are also proud of our different nutrition offerings, from helping people with meal planning and healthy recipes to our amazing Shakeology and Daily Sunshine helping families with healthy nutrition options and our other great supplements. 

But at the same time, we are not the company that exploits a situation to get ahead. And it is EXTREMELY IMPORTANT that when promoting our solutions that our Coaches never make any kind of product claims that either directly state or indirectly imply that any of Beachbody’s products (including a spotlight on any specific ingredient in our supplements) should be used to prevent or cure any symptoms, illness, or disease. 

While this has always been true, it is especially important in light of our international state of emergency and pandemic around the coronavirus. 

Making these kinds of claims is not just irresponsible as people are already extremely anxious, but it is actually illegal.  This applies to both direct and indirect claims about our products preventing or curing the coronavirus, and even discussing the benefits of our supplements and then adding a tag like #coronavirus or #virusimmunity at the bottom of a post. Beyond the negative public reaction to these tactics, many state Attorneys’ General, the Food & Drug Administration and the Federal Trade Commission continue to take direct action against companies and individuals claiming that their products should be used to prevent or cure COVID-19 and other related illnesses.  

This is a time we should be working to help people stay positive and be proactive about taking precautions. As a company it is critical not to spread any kind of misinformation. Unfortunately, there is evidence to the contrary and we are doing everything we can not to let this undermine the business by getting out in front of it. Coaches who are using these types of statements will face disciplinary measures including the possible suspension or termination of their accounts. In addition, because this is such a sensitive area which regulators and the public are being very aggressive around, we ask that if you see any of this behavior tied to Beachbody products that you please report it immediately to our Compliance department at compliance@beachbody.com so we can respond to it (we would much rather hear about it from you than a regulator!).

As we face the days and weeks ahead, we have a tremendous opportunity to help others, but we must be legal and socially responsible with the information we share and the help we offer.  Should you have concerns or questions about our product claims guidelines, you should reach out to our compliance team at compliance@beachbody.com.   We appreciate your partnership during this especially challenging time and most important, we you and your loved ones remain safe and in good health.”"

In U.S.

Presently: 5,894 confirmed cases, 97 deaths, 17 recovered.

So, pretty big deal. The other thing to keep in mind is: 5,894 is effectively a low-ball value for actual number of infected at any given time. In any country, even those with the least corruption of bias, there are going to be plenty of unconfirmed and even unsuspected cases. The infection causes quite mild symptoms in some and depending on how swamped a local health care system is, persons with symptoms which are not extreme may not be diagnosed and simple told to go home and self-isolate and call 911 only if their symptoms become severe.

And just to be clear: based on what I know, the Trump administration has handled these events in a reasonable manner, quite possibly in the best possible manner: I honestly wouldn't know for certain as I don't pay that close of attention. However, the lock-down on travel from Europe 6 days ago, DOD's lock down on all movement into, out of or through ""Level 3"" countries as of 5 days ago for all DOD personnel and dependents, and a few other measure I've heard of all sound like exactly the right sort of things for the administration to be doing."

They're offering regular people fuck all to protect them against coronavirus-induced economic upheaval. It's clear; they're irredeemable and beyond any reform. The fact that Mitt fucking Romney is outflanking them on the Left is not just a testament to their moribund state, but a portent of things to come. If the Left does not offer a clear and independent platform, social democracy will soon be monopolised by reactionaries, and Strasserism and Neoliberalism will become the only two choices.

Similarly with the party switch during the 20th century. I know the republicans are still fucking horrendous, but they’re starting to take positions that are to the left of the democrats. For example, Trump’s view on trade is far to the left of Joe Biden’s. Republicans are starting to propose an, albeit temporary, UBI bill during the coronavirus. The democrats are still marginally to the left of the republicans, but, mark my words, there is a non-0 chance that by 2030 we’ll all have more in common with the republicans than with the democrats. 

The democrats will either pull something out of their back pocket and do a complete 180 in 2024 (after Joe Biden eats shit in November) in regards to progressivism/socialism and really start pushing for a Bernie Sanders style politics, or they’re going to continue their march to the right and become as defunct as the Whigs were at the outset of the Civil War. 

IMO, there’s no real path for them to maintain their position as the most prominent “left” party in this country without capitulating to us because the Republicans will just continue to pivot to the left if they don’t.

Good morning owner,

I'm an employee at one of your shops. I have chosen to remain anonymous to aid in the prevention of retaliation from you, the plant manager, or a supervisor. A message you sent was shared with employees this morning and is quite concerning.

First off, you're downplaying the severity of a novel (meaning NEW) virus. This virus, SARS-Coronavirus-2, is responsible for the coronavirus disease (CoViD-19). Your opinion that this is not new does not mean that it is not new. I feel that the multiple, notorious and accredited doctors in the study of such diseases should be trusted more than the owner of a railcar repair company.

Second, your message was completely loaded with subjective, and highly-opinionated information. It was very unprofessional to have sent in its current state and I would recommend you consult a PR firm before ever doing something like this again. You are not an epidemiologist, doctor, nor expert in this field and to mislead your employees this way is just unacceptable. The last section is the only area with facts for preventing the spread of this disease.

Your encouragement for employees to use their PTO is also quite ridiculous considering that most of us only have 5 + 1 days to use throughout the entire year (some of us have already used most or all of them) and this virus at minimum requests a 2 week quarantine where applicable. It sounds more like you care only about production from your shops and none at all about the people operating them, but added to that, like this message is meant to cover yourself in some way should an outbreak actually happen at one of your plants.

I'm sure, by now, you're quite pissed off if you've read this far. That's how I and most of my coworkers felt reading your message. You may feel like the media is blowing this up and politics are obfuscating things further, but this is not the type of thing anyone should be sharing without very careful thought and consideration. You should have kept your own opinions and views out of it.

Thus far, there are over 4,000 cases with over 80 deaths in the United States and without proper testing, and without an abundance of test kits available, this should be expected to increase substantially if people keep downplaying its significance. We are in the middle of a pandemic and state of emergency. With over 180,000 cases and over 7,000 deaths worldwide this will become much worse than the flu if it reaches the number of cases that a typical flu season does - which is in the millions in the United States alone.

I ask that you apologize for your previous message and take into consideration the fact that this is very serious. I will be providing further links which you should take the time to view for more accurate and mostly unbiased information and advise you to do your own research more thoroughly or consult a professional before addressing your employees again on such matters as serious as this. Iwould also advise that you consult your local CDC branch or other public health officials before spreading misinformation. I have placed each plant manager whose email address was available on your website in the CC field so that they may also be made aware of this situation and can address it accordingly.

2020-03-17,into_the_space,Coronavirus,16,https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/fk9v0j/amazons_warehouse_workers_sound_alarms_about/fkrgnnh/,"As Amazon sales surge from shoppers stocking up on consumer staples, the e-commerce giant’s warehouse workers are raising alarms that the company is not doing enough to protect them from the novel coronavirus.

&#x200B;

Warehouse workers in Spain and Italy have tested positive for the virus, while workers in New York and Chicago told The Washington Post that Amazon isn’t taking enough precautions as orders mount. Some said workers were sent home only after they had coughs, and signs were posted advising workers to wash their hands.

&#x200B;

But in interviews, warehouse workers in the United States and Europe say they worry their workplaces aren’t safe enough and could contribute to the spread of the virus. More than 1,500 workers from around the world have signed a petition that calls on the company to take additional steps to ensure the safety in their workplace.

&#x200B;

A worker at one of the facilities in Spain, where some colleagues have been quarantined with coronavirus-like symptoms and two others have tested positive for covid-19, told The Post he fears the warehouse may be a hot spot and wants it shut down.

&#x200B;

“It’s an atmosphere of fear — huge fear right now,” said Luismi Ruiz, who has worked there since November 2012 and is a union representative. Amazon is spraying disinfectant throughout the warehouse and staggering employee breaks so fewer people congregate together, to reduce contagion.

&#x200B;

“These measures are totally insufficient,” Ruiz added.

&#x200B;

Business Add to list Purell prices are spiking on Amazon, as sanitizer speculation becomes a cottage industry

&#x200B;

Amazon says it’s taking appropriate precautions to protect workers. The company says it’s following guidance from health officials regarding the operation of its facilities. And it provides workers time to use the restrooms to wash their hands.

&#x200B;

How to wash your hands, according to an expert

Health officials recommend hand washing to combat the novel coronavirus and other viral infections. Here’s how to properly make sure your hands are clean. (Amber Ferguson, Luis Velarde/The Washington Post)

“We are going to great lengths to keep the buildings extremely clean and help employees practice important precautions such as social distancing and other measures,” Amazon spokeswoman Kelly Cheeseman said. “Those who don’t want to come to work are welcome to use paid and unpaid time off options and we support them in doing so.”

&#x200B;

(Amazon chief executive Jeff Bezos owns The Washington Post.)

&#x200B;

Any disruption to Amazon’s ability to deliver goods could affect countless customers, who have turned to the company in recent days to bring canned food, cleaning supplies and more to their homes so they don’t need to venture out to physical retailers and potentially spread the virus. Shoppers have turned to Amazon so frequently since the outbreak of the virus that the company has acknowledged it’s out of stock of some household staples, and its deliveries are taking longer than usual.

&#x200B;

It may not just be workers’ safety at stake. Recent research shows the coronavirus can potentially remain viable — capable of infecting a person — for up to 24 hours on cardboard and up to three days on plastic and stainless steel, though covid-19 has primarily spread through direct person-to-person contact.

&#x200B;

Amazon has long had a contentious relationship with some warehouse workers, who have helped fuel its rapid growth. For years, the company, which has nearly 800,000 workers worldwide, most of whom work in its warehouses, has been criticized for what some employees describe as poor working conditions, insufficient bathroom breaks and tough goals. They’ve also complained of the company’s efforts to squash unionization. Democratic presidential candidate Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) has denounced the company for paying subsistence wages to its warehouse staff.

&#x200B;

Following criticism, the company raised its minimum wage to $15 an hour in 2018 and has implemented other changes to improve working conditions.

&#x200B;

Now, workers are calling on the company to better protect them from a virus that’s raced through the country and led several major retailers, including Apple, Patagonia and Nike, to temporarily shut their physical stores to contain the coronavirus.

&#x200B;

At a New York delivery center, Jonathan Bailey, a sortation associate, said pressure from Amazon to meet the rate at which it wants workers to fulfill orders could lead workers to ignore safe sanitary practices. If Bailey and his colleagues don’t “make rate,” managers can write that up, a blemish on their record that can make it difficult to advance at the company and can even lead to firings, Bailey said.

&#x200B;

Long lines, low supplies: Coronavirus chaos sends shoppers into panic-buying mode

&#x200B;

So even though Amazon is encouraging workers to wash their hands, it’s not giving them enough time to do so, Bailey said. The nearest bathroom is a two- to three-minute walk in each direction, reducing the amount of time he and his colleagues have to meet company shipping expectations, he said.

&#x200B;

“If a worker is to cough or sneeze, there is no way for them to practice good sanitary habits” and run to a restroom to wash hands, said Bailey, who has worked for Amazon since last summer. “It’s going to affect your stow rate.”

&#x200B;

That’s one reason the worker petition calls for eliminating rate-based write-ups. The petition also demands the company provide paid sick leave even if workers don’t have a covid-19 diagnosis because testing remains difficult to get. And it seeks to make sure warehouses are shut if a worker tests positive for covid-19 and not reopened until it’s been thoroughly cleaned.

&#x200B;

To alleviate that strain, Amazon announced plans Monday to hire 100,000 new warehouse workers in the United States. And the company intends to raise pay by $2 an hour in the U.S., 2 pounds an hour in the UK, and approximately 2 euro an hour in parts of the European Union, a move it expects will cost $350 million.

&#x200B;

Amazon says it will hire 100,000 workers as coronavirus sparks rise in online orders

Amazon made a specific pitch to workers who have been furloughed by current employers who have suspended operations.

&#x200B;

“We want those people to know we welcome them on our teams until things return to normal and their past employer is able to bring them back,” Dave Clark, senior vice president of worldwide operations, wrote in a blog post.

&#x200B;

The additional jobs come amid growing concern about low-wage workers not having job protections to stay at home or get health coverage if they come down virus.

&#x200B;

The spread of the virus is particularly acute in Europe, as is the concern among Amazon warehouse workers there. The company has added workers in Italy recently to meet increased demand, according to Matteo Rossi, who works for Transnational Social Strike, which is trying to organize Amazon workers. He worries that could make social distancing, crucial to helping stop the spread of the disease, more difficult.

&#x200B;

“Amazon warehouses are more crowded than before,” Rossi said.

&#x200B;

Amazon confirmed that three workers at warehouses outside Madrid and Barcelona tested positive for covid-19, according to a report from the Spanish news site La Información.

&#x200B;

Gig workers face the spread of the new coronavirus with no safety net

&#x200B;

A worker at an Italian warehouse in Torrazza also tested positive for the disease, and workers there are also concerned about returning to the facility, according a report from the Italian news site La Stampa. Workers declared a strike Monday at a warehouse in Piacenza over concerns about containing the spread of the virus, La Stampa reported.

&#x200B;

Christian Kraehling worries about meetings at the start of every shift, where his colleagues at a warehouse in Bad Hersfeld, Germany, are reminded of safety precautions such as using handrails when going downstairs. Those meetings include scores of workers standing shoulder to shoulder.

&#x200B;

“It’s a very bad situation with the coronavirus,” said Kraehling, who has worked for Amazon for 10 years."

“We absolutely believe in keeping the markets open,” Mnuchin said at a Tuesday news conference at the White House. “Americans need to know they have access to their money.”

Mnuchin said he has spoken to banks and the New York Stock Exchange, and they agree on the need to keep markets operating.

There have been questions about whether stock exchanges will remain open amid concerns about the spreading coronavirus.

U.S. equity exchanges plunged at the opening bell on Monday, triggering circuit breakers that halted trading across stock markets and signaling another bruising week for companies and investors.

Jim Toes, chief executive officer of the Security Traders Association, an industry group, said markets need to remain open to “deal with the economy.”

“They can’t close the markets,” Toes said. “They’re functioning, they’re working. Unless something breaks, why?”

U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Jay Clayton said Monday that stock markets should continue to operate.

Clayton said the current environment differs from previous market shocks, such as the 2008 credit crisis or the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, partly because of steps that have been taken to bolster the financial industry since then.

“I think our banks are in a much stronger position today than they were then,” Clayton said on CNBC. “This is a demand and supply shock,” he said, adding that he’s concerned businesses might not have access to all the credit they need.

Closing markets would create more market anxiety, said Stacey Cunningham, president of the New York Stock Exchange, in a tweet on Monday.

“Closing the markets would not change the underlying causes of the market decline, would remove transparency into investor sentiment, and reduce investors’ access to their money,” she wrote.

Why is this relevant when SARS-CoV is a BSL3 pathogen and SARSr-CoVs, which this virus would have been if it was truly a lab escapee, are BSL2 pathogens? Plenty of BSL3 labs in China study SARS-CoV, and plenty also work with SARSr-CoVs in BSL2 facilities. How is being a BSL4 lab meaningful here?

>They were specifically studying coronavirus, in bats.

Again, many labs study coronaviruses and bat coronaviruses in other labs in China. This exact same line of logic could be used in several different cities in China, I see nothing special about Wuhan. And they study bat coronaviruses, but don't necessarily have bats in their facilities. AFAIK they do not, and simply trap bats in caves to extract blood/fecal samples to look for viruses in.

>There were several known incidents of poor protocol and carelessness including staff being bitten by infected animals and unprotected contact with animals feces and urine without a follow up quarantine.

Provide a source for this. There was a SARS-CoV escape in Beijing a few years back, but I've never seen anything about staff being infected by bats at the facility you're referring to, and it sounds entirely made up. Again, I'm not even certain they have bats in their facilities. Most labs that do bat virus work use bat cell lines, not live bats. 

>Now, I think it would be extremely naive to say that it's ""highly unlikely"" to have come from the new coronavirus lab up the street with inexperienced staff.

A new facility doesn't magically imply inexperienced staff. You realize people can move between facilities when a new one opens, right?

The fact that you called a lab escape ""very likely"" is not based on evidence or facts, it's based on pure speculation. At best, lab escape is plausible, but lacking any supporting evidence to suggest it at all probable."

The scientists found that severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was detectable in aerosols for up to three hours, up to four hours on copper, up to 24 hours on cardboard and up to two to three days on plastic and stainless steel. The results provide key information about the stability of SARS-CoV-2, which causes COVID-19 disease, and suggests that people may acquire the virus through the air and after touching contaminated objects. The study information was widely shared during the past two weeks after the researchers placed the contents on a preprint server to quickly share their data with colleagues.

The NIH scientists, from the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases’ Montana facility at Rocky Mountain Laboratories, compared how the environment affects SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-1, which causes SARS. SARS-CoV-1, like its successor now circulating across the globe, emerged from China and infected more than 8,000 people in 2002 and 2003. SARS-CoV-1 was eradicated by intensive contact tracing and case isolation measures and no cases have been detected since 2004. SARS-CoV-1 is the human coronavirus most closely related to SARS-CoV-2. In the stability study the two viruses behaved similarly, which unfortunately fails to explain why COVID-19 has become a much larger outbreak.

The NIH study attempted to mimic virus being deposited from an infected person onto everyday surfaces in a household or hospital setting, such as through coughing or touching objects. The scientists then investigated how long the virus remained infectious on these surfaces.

To curb the epidemic, there would need to be drastic restrictions on work, school and social gatherings for periods of time until a vaccine was available, which could take 18 months, according to the report, compiled by British researchers. They cautioned that such steps carried enormous costs that could also affect people’s health, but concluded they were “the only viable strategy at the current time.”

The White House guidelines urged Americans to avoid gatherings of more than 10 people. That is a more restrictive stance than recommendations released on Sunday by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which said that gatherings should be limited to 50.

The White House also recommended that Americans work from home, avoid unnecessary shopping trips and refrain from eating in restaurants. Some states and cities have already imposed stricter measures, including lockdowns and business closings. Different steps, intended to drive down transmission by isolating patients, quarantining those in contact with them and keeping the most vulnerable apart from others for three months, could cut the predicted death toll by half, the new report said.

Asked at a news conference with President Trump about what had led to the change in thinking by a White House task force, Dr. Deborah Birx, one of the task force leaders, said new information had come from a model developed in Britain.

Get an informed guide to the global outbreak with our daily coronavirus newsletter.

“What had the biggest impact in the model is social distancing, small groups, not going in public in large groups,” Dr. Birx said. “The most important thing was if one person in the household became infected, the whole household self-quarantined for 14 days. Because that stops 100 percent of the transmission outside of the household.”

Dr. Birx’s description of the findings were consistent with those in the report, released on Monday by an epidemic modeling group at Imperial College London. The lead author of the study, Neil Ferguson, an epidemiology professor, said in an interview that his group had shared their projections with the White House task force about a week ago and that an early copy of the report was sent over the weekend.

The group has also shared its fatality estimates with the C.D.C., Dr. Ferguson said, including that eight to nine percent of people in the most vulnerable age group, 80 and older, could die if infected.

“We don’t have a clear exit strategy,” Dr. Ferguson said of the recommended measures. “We’re going to have to suppress this virus — frankly, indefinitely — until we have a vaccine.”

“It’s a difficult position for the world to be in,” he added.

The report, which was not released in a peer-reviewed journal but was authored by 30 scientists on behalf of Imperial College’s coronavirus response team, simulated the role of public health measures aimed at reducing contact.

“The effectiveness of any one intervention in isolation is likely to be limited, requiring multiple interventions to be combined to have a substantial impact on transmission,” the authors wrote.

Dr. Ferguson said the potential health impacts were comparable to the devastating 1918 influenza outbreak, and would “kind of overwhelm health system capacity in any developed country, including the United States,” unless measures to reduce the spread of the virus were taken.

The White House task force did not respond to requests for comment. Officials stressed that the federal government’s restrictive new guidelines would be re-evaluated after 15 days, although they hinted that they were likely to be extended.

The study’s authors said their research made it clear that people in the United States might be advised to continue with draconian restrictions on their daily lives for far longer than Mr. Trump and the task force indicated on Monday.

“The major challenge of suppression,” the British scientists concluded, is the length of time that intensive interventions would be needed, given that “we predict that transmission will quickly rebound if interventions are relaxed.”

The authors said that so-called mitigation policies alone — isolating people suspected of having the virus at home, quarantining their contacts and separating the most vulnerable people from others — might reduce the peak demand on the health care system by two-thirds and deaths by half if applied for three months. But that would still result in hundreds of thousands of deaths and in health systems “overwhelmed many times over,” they said.

This was why the authors also recommended measures to distance the entire population, such as school closures. Those interventions, they suggested, could be “relaxed temporarily in relative short time windows"" and then reintroduced if new infections began growing.

The researchers said that the long-term “social and economic effects” were likely to be “profound,” and that the measures were not guaranteed to succeed and could themselves have “significant impact on health and well-being.”

“No public health intervention with such disruptive effects on society has been previously attempted for such a long duration of time,” they added. “How populations and societies will respond remains unclear.”"

You can expel virus in a droplet with every respiratory virus. Many times the droplets are too heavy to float around in the air and fall immediately to surfaces. These are not aerosolized viruses. In some viruses like measles, or the mycobacterium tuberculosis, the virus is in droplets so small they will float around in the air. This is two very different things. It doesn't mean it's dumb to wear respirators were people are spraying out droplets of virus all over the place but it's hopefully not an airborne virus, that would be even much worse.

EDIT: OK I want to clarify by adding hopefully that I don't think we can say right now based off evidence from yesterday that this coronavirus does not ever meet the definition of airborne, I'm just explaining the difference between the two. And to clarify it makes a huge difference from an epidemiological and public health standpoint, because if a virus is staying in droplet form and mostly just falling to surfaces, it means cleaning regularly is pretty effective and it's probably ok to have say take out food open as long as you limit how many people are in place at a time, and our current efforts are probably at least somewhat acceptable. If more evidence confirms that the virus is ""truly"" airborne and is definitely actually surviving in the air for extended periods, expect complete closure of basically everything and shelter in place mandates across the US to be almost guaranteed."

>>STARTING POINT:
Yi Guan and colleagues (**Science 2003**; 302: 276-78) recently reported the isolation of severe acute respiratory syndrome (**SARS) coronavirus (CoV) from Himalayan palm civets (Paguna larvata) in wet markets in Shenzen, southern China. These researchers also found serological evidence of infection in raccoon dogs (Nyctereutes procuyoinboides). Serological evidence for SARS CoV in human beings working in these markets, taken together with the earliest cases of SARS in restaurant workers, supports the contention of a potential zoonotic origin for SARS. WHERE NEXT? Will SARS reappear?** This question confronts public-health officials worldwide, particularly infectious disease personnel in those regions of the world most affected by the disease and the economic burden of SARS, including China, Taiwan, and Canada. Will the virus re-emerge from wet markets or from laboratories working with SARS CoV, or are asymptomatic infections ongoing in human beings? Similar questions can be asked about a pandemic of influenza that is probably imminent. Knowledge of the ecology of influenza in wet markets can be used as an early-warning system to detect the reappearance of SARS or pandemic influenza.

TLDR: *Multiple air traffic controllers tested positive for coronavirus.  Another tower is taking over for now, but operations will be reduced until the tower can re-open.*

The Chicago tower is in charge of ground control, takeoffs, and landings.  Without the tower in operation, the nearby TRACON tower, which normally only handles planes after they've taken off or before they get within Chicago's airspace, will be handling the takeoff and landing operations.  However, because they now have to take on multiple roles, they won't be able to land and take off as many airplanes, which means operations will be reduced.

If the TRACON tower also goes down, there's a very good chance that Chicago airport would have to close.

January 22: “We have it totally under control. It’s one person coming in from China. It’s going to be just fine.”

February 2: “Well, we pretty much shut it down coming in from China. … We can’t have thousands of people coming in who may have this problem, the coronavirus. So we’re gonna see what happens, but we did shut it down, yes.”

February 14: “We have a very small number of people in the country, right now, with it. It’s like around 12. Many of them are getting better. Some are fully recovered already. So we’re in very good shape.”

February 24: “The Coronavirus is very much under control in the USA… Stock Market starting to look very good to me!”

February 25: “CDC and my Administration are doing a GREAT job of handling Coronavirus.”

February 25: “I think that's a problem that’s going to go away… They have studied it. They know very much. In fact, we’re very close to a vaccine.”

February 26: “The 15 (cases in the US) within a couple of days is going to be down to close to zero.”

February 26: “We're going very substantially down, not up.”

February 27: “One day it’s like a miracle, it will disappear.”

February 28: “We're ordering a lot of supplies. We're ordering a lot of, uh, elements that frankly we wouldn't be ordering unless it was something like this. But we're ordering a lot of different elements of medical.”

February 28: “Now the Democrats are politicizing the coronavirus, you know that, right? Coronavirus, they’re politicizing it. We did one of the great jobs. You say, ‘How’s President Trump doing?’ They go, ‘Oh, not good, not good.’ They have no clue. They don’t have any clue. They can’t even count their votes in Iowa.” “They tried the impeachment hoax. That was on a perfect conversation. They tried anything. They tried it over and over. They’d been doing it since you got in. It’s all turning. They lost. It’s all turning. Think of it. Think of it.

March 9: ""The Fake News Media and their partner, the Democrat Party, is doing everything within its semi-considerable power (it used to be greater!) to inflame the CoronaVirus situation, far beyond what the facts would warrant.”

March 9: “So last year 37,000 Americans died from the common Flu. It averages between 27,000 and 70,000 per year. Nothing is shut down, life & the economy go on. At this moment there are 546 confirmed cases of CoronaVirus, with 22 deaths. Think about that!”

March 11: ""This is the most aggressive and comprehensive effort to confront a foreign virus in modern history.""

March 13: ""Today I am officially declaring a national emergency. Two very big words.""

March 13: ""For decades the [u/CDCgov](https://www.reddit.com/u/CDCgov/) looked at, and studied, its testing system, but did nothing about it. It would always be inadequate and slow for a large scale pandemic, but a pandemic would never happen, they hoped. **President Obama made changes that only complicated things further**""

March 14: ""SOCIAL DISTANCING!""

March 15: ""TODAY IS A NATIONAL DAY OF PRAYER. GOD BLESS EVERYONE!""

March 15: “This is a very contagious virus. It’s incredible. But it’s something that we have tremendous control over.”

Northwestern and MIT have already switched to a pass / fail option: [Northwestern Grading Policy] (https://www.northwestern.edu/coronavirus-covid-19-updates/developments/updates/winter-finals-policy.html)

Moreover, many students have situations where classes and assignments worth 30-50% have been canceled over the next two weeks. These are classes with no exams and huge participation components, and presentations / papers. Modifying the syllabus so significantly at this point in the semester would be more unfair than just making them pass / fail. As I said, I’m neither for or against, but I think clear guidance from the university will take away a lot of the anxiety and unease that comes from this.

[But the researcher that originally wrote that paper has also given credit to that incident for different reasons](https://www.pcgamer.com/the-researchers-who-once-studied-wows-corrupted-blood-plague-are-now-fighting-the-coronavirus/):

> ""For me, it was a good illustration of how important it is to understand people's behaviors,"" he says. ""When people react to public health emergencies, how those reactions really shape the course of things. We often view epidemics as these things that sort of happen to people. There's a virus and it's doing things. But really it's a virus that's spreading between people, and how people interact and behave and comply with authority figures, or don't, those are all very important things. And also that these things are very chaotic. You can't really predict 'oh yeah, everyone will quarantine. It'll be fine.' No, they won't."" 

> ""To pull it back to a Corrupted Blood analogy, and something I've been thinking about—one of the critiques we got from a lot of people, both gamers and scientists, was over this idea of griefing,"" Dr. Lofgren says. ""How griefing isn't really analogous to anything that takes place in the real world. People aren't intentionally getting people sick. And they might not be intentionally getting people sick, but wilfully ignoring your potential to get people sick is pretty close to that. You start to see people like 'oh this isn't a big deal, I'm not going to change my behavior. I'm going to the concert and then going to see my elderly grandma anyway.' Maybe don't do that. That's a big takeaway. Epidemics are a social problem... Minimizing the seriousness of something is sort of real-world griefing.""

You are right it is ""droplet"" based. It doesn't spread through naked viral particles. But it's still 'airborne' in the sense that the droplets/aerosols will be suspended in the air (behaving as any other ""gas"") for hours before they settle to a surface or evaporate completely.

There's a reason people wore N95 masks for the original SARS, too. Because it *easily* spreads through the air. There are numerous case studies in Germany which noted people were infected by merely being in the same room as someone who had it (not even coughing very much or symptomatic), **in a different cubicle**.

What you're saying is just wrong. And the CDC's note that ""people don't need masks"" was also factually *wrong*. They only said that to prevent the masses from panicking at the realization there's not enough masks for everyone. People should not really be following the CDC anymore. Their brazen inaction and lack of scientifically-backed statements is borderline criminal.

I would ignore whoever told you that, and raise red flags to the institution, because again, it's wrong. Wear masks if you're working with patients.

Even in China where people wore crazy amounts of PPE, 41% of hospital workers got infected. Without the masks, that number would have been significantly higher."

Linked article instead quotes [article from February 19th](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.02.19.20025163v1), which states:

&#x200B;

>Since the first case of Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCov) was identified in December 2019 in Wuhan City, China, the number of cases continues to grow across China and multiple cases have been exported to other countries. The cumulative number of reported deaths is at 637 as of February 7, 2020. Here we statistically estimated the time-delay adjusted death risk for Wuhan as well as for China excluding Wuhan to interpret the current severity of the epidemic in China. We found that the latest estimates of the death risk in Wuhan could be as high as 20% in the epicenter of the epidemic whereas we estimate it \~1% in the relatively mildly-affected areas. Because the elevated death risk estimates are likely associated with a breakdown of the medical/health system, enhanced public health interventions including social distancing and movement restrictions should be effectively implemented to bring the epidemic under control."

I am Dr. Riciu Andrei, board certified dermatologist from Europe with a strong interest in infectious diseases and fellow moderator at r/Dermatology. I've been keeping a close eye on the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic since it only numbered a few cases in the Wuhan - Hubei province. I remember reporting on a medical website I had back in 2011 about a Dutch Researcher that created a superinfluenza virus as a research project, that was hypothesized to be able to infect millions simply by combining five distinct natural mutations into one H5N1 strain. The times we live in right now aren't pretty much different (except this time the virus is not in a cell culture locked in some research facility).

The emergence of SARS-COV-2  that  has spread from animals to humans gave birth to a true pandemic in a matter of months.

The abundance of fake news and claims being spread over the internet as we speak  generate a lot of panic and irrational behavior that obviously does more harm than good.

I managed to get a team of dedicated medical professionals, data scientists and programmers and we decided to create a resource website dedicated to the new Coronavirus / SARS-CoV-2 pandemic in order to help as many people as we can gain access to reliable medical information ( documented sources) as well as statistics regarding the COVID-19 disease outbreak.

Please let us know what other new  features you would like to see on the website. We are really keen on helping as much people as we can gain access to safe and reliable medical information in order to better fight this horrible outbreak.

Meet Our Team
Dr. Riciu Andrei - board certified dermatologist from Europe with a strong interest in infectious diseases, rookie web designer and moderator at r/Dermatology (reddit). Dr. Riciu came up with the website idea after having a hard time finding a single source for accurate data regarding the COVID-19 pandemic.  You can find Andrei on the dedicated CoronaVirus Discord server where he tries to reply to as much questions as he can on a daily basis.

Alex Dumitru -  Alex is both our front-end as well as back-end web developer. He spends most of his day aggregating statistics about the COV-19 pandemic and presents them in a digestible manner on our homepage.

Daniel Hay - The man with the curiosity to explore what problems need to be solved. Daniel is part mathematician, part computer scientist and part trend-spotter. He joined our team after finding our website on Reddit.

Dr. Aarav Dumont - Anaesthesiologist from India. Dr Arav that comes with all the new chart and graphics ideas for Daniel and Alex. He is currently getting his PhD in medical science.

Danny - Danny is a nutrition and physiology BSc student and the latest member of our team. While wishing to remain anonymous, Danny kindly donated a large social media account (Twitter) to aid us in our cause bringing curated medical information and acurate COVID-19 data to the public.

This website is founded entirely by ourselves and we do not accept any sponsorships from third parties, because our main goal is data integrity and information trustworthiness.

Trump just injected 1 trillion to stimulate the economy during this crisis.  A quick glance at some articles, and I can't find exactly where that money is going, but I can find that he's considering giving Americans a $1000 check every month during this coronavirus outbreak. 

So, Trump's plan is 1 trillion total, Sanders' is a quarter trillion for one month.  Obviously, they're getting the money by ~~putting the US in more debt~~  using tax money they collected last year that's just sitting around right now."

We wanted to know – based on the new guidelines to limit social contact: Are playdates safe? Dr. Adams advised against it for the time being: ""It's not worth the risk of our kids being spreaders and potentially taking it to someone else.""

2) You can be a transmitter of COVID-19 without showing symptoms

Common symptoms of the coronavirus include fever, cough, and shortness of breath, but some people don't exhibit symptoms at all. Dr. Adams says that even if you're asymptomatic, you could ""absolutely"" still transmit the virus to others. ""We know that the people who are most at risk are those with underlying medical conditions, especially seniors, people over the age of 60. We need to understand that the folks who are transmitting the virus across the planet and in our country are younger people.""

3) The nation's top doctor says he ""wouldn't fault"" any mayor or governor for shelter-in-place policies

More than seven million people in the San Francisco Bay Area have been advised to shelter in place, and on Tuesday, New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio said the city was considering a similar policy there. Dr. Adams told us, ""As [Dr. Tony Fauci] says, 'if it seems like an overreaction right now, then you're probably about where you need to be.' Again, it's why the administration put out these guidelines for all of America — not just for certain areas, but for all of America — to look at the ways that they can prevent transmission of disease in their communities. I wouldn't fault any mayor, any governor for what they're considering in their communities. But at the very least, limit social gatherings to less than 10, stay at home if you can from work and avoid non-essential travel.""

4) If you're experiencing symptoms,  a negative test result ""shouldn't change the way you behave""

As tests for COVID-19 become more widely available, Dr. Adams cautions that a negative test shouldn't stop someone with symptoms from self-quarantining, ""because you could test negative, and still have coronavirus. You could still be early and you could still transmit it; so if you have symptoms, you should still isolate.""

5) Health care professionals see a decrease in blood donations across the country

Dr. Adams told us there has been a decrease in blood donations across the country since the outbreak began.

Coronavirus isn't what is fucking the economy up, it was only the trigger, the tipping point. The market and the economy have NEVER recovered from 2008, it's been displaced, the recovery NEVER happened (job increases were part time badly paid jobs, for example). Economic slowdowns was already happening before the virus hit. You could even make the argument that the crisis is the SAME as the one from 1928, with only a partial respite post WW2 due to destroyed capital, which temporarily halted the decaying global rate of profit.

Later, China expelled three Wall Street Journal reporters.

“I regret China’s decision today to further foreclose the world’s ability to conduct free-press operations that frankly would be really good for the Chinese people,” Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told reporters. “This is unfortunate. I hope they’ll reconsider.”

The new rules would reshape foreign journalism in China.

AD

The statement said that U.S. citizens working for The Post, the Times and the Wall Street Journal, whose press credentials are due to expire before the end of 2020, must hand back their press cards. They will not be able to go to Hong Kong or Macao as a base for work, it said.

That will mean that many journalists will be forced to leave. An initial review by The Post suggested that the Chinese order would apply to one Post correspondent, Gerry Shih, who is a U.S. citizen, said Douglas Jehl, foreign editor at The Post.

“We unequivocally condemn any action by China to expel U.S. reporters,” said Martin Baron, executive editor of The Post.

“The Chinese government’s decision is particularly regrettable because it comes in the midst of an unprecedented global crisis, when clear and reliable information about the international response to covid-19 is essential,” he continued.

AD

“Severely limiting the flow of that information, which China now seeks to do, only aggravates the situation,” Baron said.

The new rules take aim at some U.S. media outlets, but not others. the Associated Press and Bloomberg have offices in Beijing, for instance, as do major U.S. broadcasters, including CNN, ABC, NBC and CBS.

Some U.S. media outlets base their East Asian team in Hong Kong, where press freedom has been largely protected under a “one country, two systems” agreement when the territory returned to Chinese control in 1997.

The New York Times and the Wall Street Journal have large newsrooms in Hong Kong. The Washington Post has a bureau there.

AD

There is no indication from the Chinese Foreign Ministry statement that Hong Kong operations will be affected.

China has long had a complicated relationship with foreign media.

Over the past decade, Beijing has delayed or revoked press credentials to punish new outlets for lines of coverage that it does not like — such as reports on repression in Xinjiang or investigations into the wealth of its leaders.

The United States has struggled to respond, wary that placing restrictions on Chinese media in the United States might hurt U.S. journalists China.

That U.S. caution ended last month. The State Department announced Feb. 18 that it would now treat the U.S. operations of five Chinese news organizations as official government entities, or “foreign missions.” The U.S. list included the state-run news agency Xinhua and the China Daily.

AD

The next day, China fired back. Beijing expelled three Wall Street Journal reporters, marking the first time in the post-Mao era that multiple foreign journalists were kicked out at once.

Beijing cast the move as a response to a Feb. 3 headline on an Opinion section piece in the Journal that referred to China, at it battled the novel coronavirus, as “the real sick man of Asia.”

Matt Murray, the paper’s editor in chief, said the Journal will keep reporting.

“We oppose government interference with a free press anywhere in the world, he said. “Our commitment to reporting fully and deeply on China is unchanged.”"

U.S. Virus Plan Anticipates 18-Month Pandemic and Widespread Shortages

March 17, 2020, 7:49 p.m. ET

WASHINGTON — A federal government plan to combat the coronavirus warned policymakers last week that a pandemic “will last 18 months or longer” and could include “multiple waves,” resulting in widespread shortages that would strain consumers and the nation’s health care system.
The 100-page plan, dated Friday, the same day President Trump declared a national emergency, laid out a grim prognosis for the spread of the virus and outlined a response that would activate agencies across the government and potentially employ special presidential powers to mobilize the private sector.
Among the “additional key federal decisions” listed among the options for Mr. Trump was invoking the Defense Production Act of 1950, a Korean War-era law that authorizes a president to take extraordinary action to force American industry to ramp up production of critical equipment and supplies such as ventilators, respirators and protective gear for health care workers.
“Shortages of products may occur, impacting health care, emergency services, and other elements of critical infrastructure,” the plan warned. “This includes potentially critical shortages of diagnostics, medical supplies (including PPE and pharmaceuticals), and staffing in some locations.” P.P.E. refers to personal protective equipment.


The plan continued: “State and local governments, as well as critical infrastructure and communications channels, will be stressed and potentially less reliable. These stresses may also increase the challenges of getting updated messages and coordinating guidance to these jurisdictions directly.”

The plan, which was unclassified but marked “For Official Use Only // Not For Public Distribution or Release,” was shared with The New York Times as Mr. Trump escalated his efforts to curb the spread of the virus. After weeks of playing down the seriousness of the pandemic, saying it would miraculously disappear, Mr. Trump began shifting to a more sober tone during a news conference on Friday announcing the national emergency.
Much of the plan is bureaucratic in nature, describing coordination among agencies and actions that in some cases have already been taken, like urging schools to close and large events to be canceled. But its discussion of the Defense Production Act came as lawmakers and others urged Mr. Trump to invoke its powers.
“While the administration’s response has so far lacked the urgency this crisis has called for, there are still steps you can take to mitigate the damage,” Senator Bob Menendez, Democrat of New Jersey, wrote in a letter to Mr. Trump on Tuesday. “Invoking the powers vested in the DPA will enable the federal government to step up and take the type of aggressive steps needed in this time of uncertainty.”

her letter sent last week by 57 House Democrats led by Representative Andy Levin of Michigan made similar points: “During World War II, our country adapted to the demands of the time to produce mass quantities of bombers, tanks, and many smaller items needed to save democracy and freedom in the world. We know what the demands of this time are, and we must act now to meet these demands.”

Senator Jack Reed, Democrat of Rhode Island, said that Defense Secretary Mark T. Esper told him on Tuesday that the Pentagon would provide federal health workers with five million respirator masks and 2,000 specialized ventilators. “The American public is on wartime footing in terms of battling the spread of this disease, and the Pentagon has to be part of the effort to help protect the health and safety of the American people,” Mr. Reed said.
But Mr. Trump said on Tuesday that he was not ready to invoke the Defense Production Act. “We’re able to do that if we have to,” he told reporters. “Right now, we haven’t had to, but it’s certainly ready. If I want it, we can do it very quickly. We’ve studied it very closely over two weeks ago, actually. We’ll make that decision pretty quickly if we need it. We hope we don’t need it. It’s a big step.”
Passed in 1950 shortly after American troops went to war defending South Korea against an invasion from North Korea, the Defense Production Act was based on powers used during World War II and authorized the president to require businesses to prioritize and accept contracts necessary for national defense.


Over the years, its scope has been expanded to include domestic preparedness and national emergencies. A president can make direct loans or loan guarantees and purchase commitments, subsidies or other incentives to influence industry to help in times of crisis.
Other key decisions outlined as options for the president include distributing medical supplies and equipment from the Strategic National Stockpile, providing money to states to help them meet demands caused by the coronavirus outbreak and prioritizing the distribution of essential resources to focus on areas most in need.
“The spread and severity of Covid-19 will be difficult to forecast and characterize,” the government plan said. It warned of “significant shortages for government, private sector, and individual U.S. consumers.”"

The Coronavirus is only fatal to old people (since they have bad immune systems and health in most cases). Old people are the only people that should have to be isolated.

I've heard that some people have had the Coronavirus and only experienced symptoms of a generic cold so the Coronavirus really isn't that big of a deal. The fact that the whole world is panicking because of a little virus is pathetic and shows how ridiculous most people are.

**By Jackie Salo**


A Belgian doctor working to battle the coronavirus says he’s treated several seriously ill young patients — and their lung scans were “nothing short of terrifying,” according to reports.

Dr. Ignace Demeyer, who works at a hospital in Aalst, said an increasing number of people between the ages of 30 and 50 have presented with severe symptoms, despite having “blank medical records” that show no underlying conditions that would make them high-risk, the Brussels Times reported.

“They just walk in, but they are terribly affected by the virus,” Demeyer told the Belgian broadcaster VRT.

He said CT scans indicated they were suffering from severe lung damage.

“The images we took yesterday are nothing short of terrifying,” the doctor told the station.

“They are people who do not smoke, who have no other conditions such as diabetes or heart failure,” Demeyer added.

Belgium has reported at least 1,085 COVID-19 cases and at least five deaths since the virus emerged in China in December.

Worldwide, there have been more than 190,000 people infected as of Tuesday afternoon, according to a tally from Johns Hopkins University."

Eh, purely subjective. I'm not a fan of the autotune either but I thought the last album was pretty good.

>this comeback could’ve been much bigger and succesful also on could debut on #1 if bighit didnt release 20 songs with solo songs in it.

I agree that their release strategy was a mess and kinda killed the hype but I don't think the fandom would have managed a #1 at this point, the difference between that and #3 was really big."

The beginning of it was a rally where they were congratulating themselves and each other on high sales during a recent event. Coronavirus came up later, through an answering of GM questions in the chat. It was, frankly, a shitshow. People expressed a lot of concern on behalf of their stores, their employees, and their customers, but corporate had nothing to say except ""we're out here with you!"" and ""double down on cleaning!"" I can say for a fact that I'm the only person in my store working to keep the area sanitized, and I know that no one in my store has been tested, despite several of us having been in areas/been in contact where cases are popping up. 

This is dangerous, not only to us as employees, but also to our families, and to our customers. We're being actively encouraged to go to peoples' homes despite not having been tested. No mention has been made to us of longer sick leave for infected coworkers. We're being expected to use up our sick leave, and then go unpaid. Brief mentions of work going remote with it going unrealized in our area so far despite mounting cases.

A lot of our customers are elderly or low-income families with children, and we're actively endangering them by going to their homes, and calling them about their bills despite knowing a lot of them are without paychecks at the moment.

It's horrific how little they seem to care. I hope other divisions aren't as bad as ours -- but if you're in Georgia, I would seriously consider cancelling any orders and not opening the door if people come knocking, for your own health and safety."

The mortality rate is probably MUCH lower than we're estimating currently if this result is replicated elsewhere.  As we get more tests in, the publicized death rates will fall and panic will hopefully die down.  


This virus is much more infectious than anything else we've seen in a long long time but perhaps much less deadly than we currently think as well.

The 100-page plan, dated Friday, the same day President Trump declared a national emergency, laid out a grim prognosis for the spread of the virus and outlined a response that would activate agencies across the government and potentially employ special presidential powers to mobilize the private sector.

Among the “additional key federal decisions” listed among the options for Mr. Trump was invoking the Defense Production Act of 1950, a Korean War-era law that authorizes a president to take extraordinary action to force American industry to ramp up production of critical equipment and supplies such as ventilators, respirators and protective gear for health care workers.

“Shortages of products may occur, impacting health care, emergency services, and other elements of critical infrastructure,” the plan warned. “This includes potentially critical shortages of diagnostics, medical supplies (including PPE and pharmaceuticals), and staffing in some locations.” P.P.E. refers to personal protective equipment.

The plan continued: “State and local governments, as well as critical infrastructure and communications channels, will be stressed and potentially less reliable. These stresses may also increase the challenges of getting updated messages and coordinating guidance to these jurisdictions directly.”

The plan, which was unclassified but marked “For Official Use Only // Not For Public Distribution or Release,” was shared with The New York Times as Mr. Trump escalated his efforts to curb the spread of the virus. After weeks of playing down the seriousness of the pandemic, saying it would miraculously disappear, Mr. Trump began shifting to a more sober tone during a news conference on Friday announcing the national emergency.

Much of the plan is bureaucratic in nature, describing coordination among agencies and actions that in some cases have already been taken, like urging schools to close and large events to be canceled. But its discussion of the Defense Production Act came as lawmakers and others urged Mr. Trump to invoke its powers.

“While the administration’s response has so far lacked the urgency this crisis has called for, there are still steps you can take to mitigate the damage,” Senator Bob Menendez, Democrat of New Jersey, wrote in a letter to Mr. Trump on Tuesday. “Invoking the powers vested in the DPA will enable the federal government to step up and take the type of aggressive steps needed in this time of uncertainty.”

Another letter sent last week by 57 House Democrats led by Representative Andy Levin of Michigan made similar points: “During World War II, our country adapted to the demands of the time to produce mass quantities of bombers, tanks, and many smaller items needed to save democracy and freedom in the world. We know what the demands of this time are, and we must act now to meet these demands.”
Senator Jack Reed, Democrat of Rhode Island, said that Defense Secretary Mark T. Esper told him on Tuesday that the Pentagon would provide federal health workers with five million respirator masks and 2,000 specialized ventilators. “The American public is on wartime footing in terms of battling the spread of this disease, and the Pentagon has to be part of the effort to help protect the health and safety of the American people,” Mr. Reed said.

But Mr. Trump said on Tuesday that he was not ready to invoke the Defense Production Act. “We’re able to do that if we have to,” he told reporters. “Right now, we haven’t had to, but it’s certainly ready. If I want it, we can do it very quickly. We’ve studied it very closely over two weeks ago, actually. We’ll make that decision pretty quickly if we need it. We hope we don’t need it. It’s a big step.”

Passed in 1950 shortly after American troops went to war defending South Korea against an invasion from North Korea, the Defense Production Act was based on powers used during World War II and authorized the president to require businesses to prioritize and accept contracts necessary for national defense.

Over the years, its scope has been expanded to include domestic preparedness and national emergencies. A president can make direct loans or loan guarantees and purchase commitments, subsidies or other incentives to influence industry to help in times of crisis.

Other key decisions outlined as options for the president include distributing medical supplies and equipment from the Strategic National Stockpile, providing money to states to help them meet demands caused by the coronavirus outbreak and prioritizing the distribution of essential resources to focus on areas most in need.

“The spread and severity of Covid-19 will be difficult to forecast and characterize,” the government plan said. It warned of “significant shortages for government, private sector, and individual U.S. consumers.”"

My Mom said their meetings had just been suspended but happily announced they were having 20 people over to their house for the memorial. 

This really pisses me off for a number of reasons- the most obvious being I’m concerned for my parents (and their congregations)health because they’re not taking the virus / quarantine measures seriously. Beyond that though- their attitude is extremely selfish. My feeds are packed with friends in distress- many in the service and music industry- now all out of work and clueless as to how they’ll make ends meet. Irresponsible “we know better” behavior is what’s going to drag this thing out and keep my friends in financial-trouble longer.

**After swiftly imposing curbs to prevent spread of the Coronavirus, Codogno now has fewer cases, even as the scenario worsens in nearby towns**

*By Margherita Stancati*

*March 16, 2020 4:50 pm ET*

In mid-February, a 38-year-old man in Codogno, a small town just outside Milan, became the first known person to be infected with the new coronavirus in Italy.

The reaction by local authorities was swift. The roughly 50,000 people who live in Codogno and nearby towns were told to only leave their homes if absolutely necessary, and the area was sealed off from the rest of Italy.

Now, three weeks later, even as the Italian government has locked down the entire country, Codogno is almost free of the virus, recording just a few new infections each day.

The sharp fall in new cases in Codogno and surrounding towns in the heart of the outbreak—from an average of about 100 new cases per day in early March to an average of under 50 per day in recent days—is an early indication that the drastic containment measures that have since been imposed across Italy and elsewhere in Europe could be beginning to work.

Codogno’s experience “tells us that if you introduce social distancing earlier, you will have a lower spread of cases, and if you have a lower spread, you will have fewer deaths,” said Melinda Mills, a professor of sociology at Oxford University who co-wrote a paper on the transmission of Covid-19, the disease caused by the virus.

On Feb. 19, when a young man showed up at a hospital in the northern Italian town of Codogno with a fever and a bad cough, Ciro Esposito, a doctor working there, asked if he’d been to China. The patient hadn’t.

But a test the next day confirmed that the man nonetheless had the virus. Italian public health authorities later traced his infection back to Germany, where the virus was carried by a businesswoman who had been to Shanghai. It is unclear how it reached Italy from there, or where the young man from Codogno—whose full name can’t be disclosed under Italy’s privacy laws—caught the virus.

Two days later, tests showed that Dr. Esposito had also been infected. His hospital quickly became the center of an outbreak that has ballooned to become the worst outside of China, where scientists believe it originated. Some 28,000 people have tested positive to the virus in Italy, of whom 2,158 died.

“China seemed far away,” said Dr. Esposito, who was discharged from hospital a few days ago, and is now in self-isolation at home in Codogno. “But unfortunately this virus knows no borders. The only way to avoid getting infected if we all stay at home.”

After the first Codogno patient tested positive in February, doctors quickly realized the disease had begun to spread in the surrounding region of Lombardy, including in its capital, Milan. Soon, new clusters began to emerge across the peninsula.

While the Codogno area was quickly declared a “red zone”—with armed forces manning checkpoints to bar anyone from leaving or entering it—in the rest of Italy restrictions on social gatherings were only loosely imposed at first. That changed as new cases continued to soar at an alarming rate.

The majority of cases are in Lombardy, where hospitals are running out of beds in intensive care units to treat all those severely sick with Covid-19.

While the residents of Codogno rarely left their homes, in the nearby city of Bergamo, life continued almost as normal until March 8, when it was placed under lockdown along with the rest of Lombardy.

During that time, the disease spread widely among the population there—and Bergamo now has more people with Covid than anywhere else in Italy, including the Codogno area. The number of overall cases has increased by 76% over the past five days in Bergamo compared to 21% in Lodi—the province under early lockdown that includes Codogno, where Italy’s outbreak started.

The pattern of infection in these two areas shows how big an impact social restrictions can have on containing the virus, said Ms. Mills,

“There is a lot of talk about flattening the curve,” she said “But this is the first, clear empirical evidence that social distancing plays a strong role.”

About two weeks after the Codogno area was locked down, so was the rest of Lombardy. Two days later, the lockdown was extended to the whole of Italy, a drastic step aimed at preventing the country’s public health care system from collapsing.

It will take some time for those measures to have a visible impact across Italy, say public health experts, since the incubation period of the virus can last for two weeks.

In Codogno, however, the coronavirus curve is already beginning to flatten.

“Our citizens followed the rules meticulously. We urged everyone to stay at home, and continue to do so,” said Francesco Passerini, the mayor of Codogno. “We are just at the beginning of this battle, it’s certainly not over.”

Even as most of Italy lives under the lockdown, restrictions on Codogno were effectively loosened when the lockdown was extended to other parts of the country.

The checkpoints around the area have been removed, and residents are now allowed to commute to work if they can’t work remotely. Like the rest of Italy, they can leave their homes only if they can prove it is necessary.

“We are worried our sacrifices will be for nothing,” said Mr. Passerini. “Now that people are able to move for work, it means the main vectors—people—are circulating again. How can we guarantee that someone won’t get infected in Milan?”

The first Codogno patient was battling for his life until last week, but has now been discharged from intensive care. He remains hospitalized, but can now breathe on his own. His pregnant wife, who was also infected, is already at home.

“Knowing that he can now breathe on his own is lifting our spirits,” says Giuseppe Stringhini, 57, a resident of Codogno who knows several people who were sickened and died. He returned to work as a bank manager in a nearby city on March 8, when the checkpoints around Codogno were removed."

Looking across South America, we have:

* Argentina tightening travel restrictions

* Peru suspending air and sea transport

* Venezuela imposing ""collective quarantine""

* Panama restricting entry and ordering hotels, bars, casinos etc. to close

* Honduras closing all beaches and non-vital businesses

* Columbia restricting entry for foreigners
and last but not least...

* **Bolsonaro shrugging off advice from medical experts that he isolate after members of his delegation test positive for the virus...even being so bold as to celebrate with large groups in the street.**

On top of all this we see a mass prison escape that just took place, where hundreds of inmates escaped from at least four prisons.

And now audio has leaked from doctors where they believe that the virus will infect 45,000 people in Sao Paolo alone within the next four months. Of those, they expect 11,000 will need ICU but there are likely not enough beds
[Source](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/internacional/en/scienceandhealth/2020/03/doctors-dispute-spread-of-coronavirus-in-brazil.shtml)

In fact, if we follow the math and include both public and private hospital ICU beds there are probably only enough beds to cover half those patients

So, what does this mean? EWZ is on the rise today in what I am guessing is a market pump...currently up about 9%...I think this will eat shit over the coming weeks.

The amount has not been disclosed yet, but the plan has bipartisan support, so it will likely happen. The goal is to have these checks in the hands of Americans within two weeks.

The idea is that COVID19 has forced many people to stay home from work, and has resulted in many people being laid off. This will have a massive negative effect on their lives since so many Americans live paycheck to paycheck. In turn this will also have a very negative effect on the US economy as a whole. 

When a huge portion of the population suddenly isn’t getting paid, then money stops moving. People can’t buy or sell anything and the economy grinds to a halt. This can be very, very bad.

In order to help Americans through this difficult time and to help the economy as a whole, Mitt Romney proposed giving $1,000 to every American adult. The White House  seems to be running with a similar plan. More details will come within the next 24 hours, according to the White House.

But there's no reason to believe that it's the norm. That's part of why it was reported -> it was a very unusual finding! And could have been observed for any number of reasons including:

1. false positive at initial testing (patient tested +ive when initial respiratory or other symptoms prompted the test, but did not actually have coronavirus at that time. However, they did become infected later)
2. false negative as part of presumed recovery, but virus *actually not* fully cleared and a relapse occurred without a second independent infection (virus remained in body tissues)
3. human error or contamination in testing (test did not accurately reflect the patient it was attributed to)
4. patient-specific reasons, including rare deficiencies in the ability of that person to mount an effective antibody response to a viral pathogen. Their unique susceptibility to reinfection is not generalizable at the population level.
5. viral mutation into a strain just different enough that it evades immune antibody responses (two substrains circulating)

Based on what we know of coronaviruses in general, the expectation is that most to all patients will develop immunity after infection.

Based on [experimental infections in monkeys](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.13.990226v1), immunity to reinfection occurs.

Based on previous successes with SARS and [reports from Chinese doctors working to treat COVID19 patients](http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/2020-02/28/c_138828177.htm), giving convalescent serum (plasma from recovered patients, presumed to carry neutralizing antibodies) to patients seems to improve outcomes and speed recovery, suggesting that the immune system does create a specific antiviral antibody response."

The incubation period for COVID19 is 5 - 14 days with some scientists believing possibly longer.  A lot of people are going to get sick in the next few weeks.  The vast majority will recover, but it's very likely half the population is getting this.  Dealing with a number like 360 million, means hundreds of thousands if not over a million deaths is possible in the US.

Shutting everything down is painful and seems like an overaction but it is for the best. Children are the least likely to show symptoms and not the most hygienic.

As noted above, the RBD of SARS-CoV-2 is optimized for binding to human ACE2 with an efficient solution different from those previously predicted.

**They're saying here that if this was an engineered virus, the binding domain (the region of the virus that initially binds to a human cell and allows it to infect that cell) would be more optimized. COVID-19's binding domain only sorta-okay binds.**

> Furthermore, if genetic manipulation had been performed, one of the several reverse-genetic systems available for betacoronaviruses would probably have been used. However, the genetic data irrefutably show that SARS-CoV-2 is not derived from any previously used virus backbone. 

**Scientists don't just build a virus like a factory builds a car. What they do is more analogous to taking a Honda Civic and swapping out the engine and wheels. In this case, the Civic would be the ""backbone"" that the ""new"" car is built on. What the authors are saying here is that there are no known backbones to COVID-19 globally. The chances of this specific group in China creating a brand new backbone is essentially zero.**

> Instead, we propose two scenarios that can plausibly explain the origin of SARS-CoV-2: (i) natural selection in an animal host before zoonotic transfer; and (ii) natural selection in humans following zoonotic transfer. 

**Honestly, this is mostly semantics. They're trying to say that either COVID-19 mutated in an animal and inadvertently became more efficient at infecting humans *or* it accidentally infected a human and *then* mutated to become more efficient at infecting humans. Chicken or the egg type of thing in a way.**

> We also discuss whether selection during passage could have given rise to SARS-CoV-2.

**""Passage"" is simply infecting cells in a petri dish with a virus over and over again (new cells each time because obviously the virus will kill the original cells). When you passage a virus, you will always be putting evolutionary pressure on that virus to gain mutations that make it more efficient at infecting those cells (that's all the virus sees and there's an unlimited supply, so why not?). So, in theory, you could passage a virus on human lung cells and make it more adept at infecting human lung cells. But, earlier in the paper they show that passaging a coronavirus would not lead to COVID-19.**

Did that help?"

This
>the original compromise bill included 12 weeks of paid family and medical leave for workers with COVID-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus, symptoms of COVID-19 or those caring for others who are sick.  

>Now, after the legislative text was updated, those family leave provisions in the bill are much weaker. Paid family leave would only be available to parents who are home with kids due to school closure. The extended leave wouldn’t be available for people who are sick with COVID-19. Those workers would only be able to take 10 days of paid sick leave ― and only if they work at a company with less than 500 employees. What’s more: Companies with fewer than 50 workers can apply for hardship relief and get out of providing both sick and family leave."

They've created a few models that show how things will play out if you don't take immediate action and it's grim. They're looking at hundreds of thousands of lives lost and 1.1 mil lost in the US. The main reason for this will be because the healthcare system wouldn't be able to support the number of cases

So the guy pulled everyone aside and said look, I'm not playing with these models. It's going to kill no matter what _but_ you can avoid it by practicing social distancing, self isolation, etc etc. He said by doing so you can cut the number of deaths by half since social distancing and isolation will make sure everyone else is kept safe. It has a 100% success rate because you're guaranteeing the virus never leaves the house

He also said that one thing we have to plan for is rebounding, meaning: When the numbers look well enough for people to think that maybe it's okay to reintroduce larger meetups. He's saying we shouldn't do that and that we need to get ready to ride this thing out for a while. He said it's going to be _at least_ 12 to 18 months before we see any type of vaccine or anything that will definitely prove that the situation is getting better so we need to act NOW to make sure we can handle everything in the process

The article is saying that these reports are now influencing the governments in both the UK and US and we'll see more lockdowns and immediate action to make sure people don't overwhelm the hospitals

**tl;dr** Social distancing/isolation is the best treatment for society as a whole as we fight this. A guy managed to convince the US/UK to take this seriously so expect sever lockdowns in the future that will last at least 12 to 18 months regardless of whether or not the numbers show that countries are handling the coronavirus better."

The coronavirus is absolutely not worth it to destroy our whole economy over. Staying at home is a luxury and a privilege that most people simply can't afford to do. There are bills and rent to pay. Millions of American workers have absolutely no paid leave. Millions have no health insurance. Millions have no savings and live paycheck to paycheck. How were they supposed to ""prep"" if they didn't have any extra money to spend like crazy? 

Retail, restaurant, hospitality, and travel industries have already been hit super hard. I work in hospitality as a hotel housekeeper and as of today all hourly staff is supposed to stay at home until further notice. Our hotel hasn't shut down (yet) but you know it's coming. The uncertainty is crazy. In the meantime everybody just keep saying ""stay at home"" as if it's such an obvious thing. People tend to forget that most people don't have a job that can be done from home. Not everybody works in a fucking office and in the corporate world. 

People both online and offline have called me selfish because I said that I would rather work through this whole thing. It's SURVIVAL. Has anyone ever heard of ""Maslow's hierarchy of needs""? When you have bills, food and rent to pay, you don't give a shit about the greater good. Your chance of dying from coronavirus is 3% on average (0.2% if you are under 40), your chance of getting evicted if you don't pay rent is 100%. Even after this whole thing blows over, the economy will be down the drain for many months or years to come."

Viruses are much, much smaller. So, in a hospital setting, masks are always a standard precaution to prevent the spread of infection due to bacteria. 

Viruses, on the other hand, are far more difficult to completely prevent spreading due to them being able to penetrate PPE. Coronavirus grows faster and lives longer without a host than other viruses. 

In the case of the masks above, I think the biggest issue is even if the mask does filter something out, the virus could be hanging out living on the mask. If you’re re-using the mask or even just breathing through it constantly you could argue that the mask catching and holding more debris could put you at greater risk than simply not having the mask. 

My point: if you’re going to use a mask, only use it for high risk situations like checking out at the grocery store etc. then throw it out immediately after you’re done."

In view of a study with encouraging results carried out on this drug, ""Sanofi undertakes to make its treatment available to France and to offer several million doses which could make it possible to treat 300,000 patients"", indicated to the AFP Tuesday a spokesperson for the laboratory, while specifying that the group stood ready to work with French health authorities ""to confirm these results"".

Plaquenil, a hydroxychloroquine molecule, also used for decades in autoimmune diseases like lupus or rheumatoid arthritis, could indeed have an effect on the disappearance of the virus, said Monday Professor Didier Raoult, director of Institut University Hospital of Marseille. Virus disappears in six days According to this study conducted by Professor Raoult on 24 patients with coronavirus, six days after the start of taking Plaquenil, the virus had disappeared in three quarters of those treated. Earlier today, the French government spokeswoman said the clinical trials were ""promising"" and would be extended to a larger number of patients."

Y por lo que sé, la noticia tiene inexactitudes. Sobre todo en los efectos luego del contacto entre el chico de Selva, y la chica de Córdoba (positivo por COVID 19). Luego de ese contacto, el chico volvió a Selva, e hizo vida normal por 5 días en ese pueblo. Dicen que desde el lunes 9 ya estaba en Selva. Otra cosa que dicen es que durante la semana fue al gimnasio, por ejemplo. Y la gota que rebalsó el vaso fue que el viernes 13 a la noche fue a un cumpleaños y a una fiesta donde hubo (dicen, repito) 100 personas. Al otro día, el chico empezó a sentir síntomas y llamó al hospital. Lo internaron. El avisó por Whatsapp a sus conocidos que tenía síntomas de Coronavirus al mediodia del sábado. Tiene todas las fichas de ser positivo, pero no está confirmado por este temita de la centralización de los testeos en el Malbran. Cuando al chico le preguntaron por los contactos que tuvo, mencionó esa fiesta. Imagínense que tenés que poner en cuarentena a casi un centenar de personas y sus familiares en un pueblo de no mas de 3000 habitantes...por eso, al toque pusieron en cuarentena a todo Selva (cerrando la entrada y salida del pueblo), y la Municipalidad de Selva se contactó con sus pares de Ceres, para avisarles que salgan a buscar a los 15 chicos de Ceres que fueron a esa fiesta (las malas lenguas dicen que eran mas...20 seguro hubo). La policía y el hospital puso en cuarentena a esa gente y sus familiares (17 familias). Al día siguiente, tanto Ceres (que debe tener 20mil habitantes) como Selva eran un pandemónium. El lunes, Ceres fue puesta en cuarentena. Pero imagínense lo difícil que es instrumentar materialmente una medida así. Porque pese a que Gendarmería y Policía están apostados en la Ruta Nacional 34, el colador está en los caminos rurales. Hay mucha gente de Selva que tiene cuentas en Banco Nación Ceres, o en BSF Ceres. Y viceversa. Gente que tiene hijos en la otra ciudad. Gente que trabaja ahí o en campos cercanos. El lunes vieron gente de Selva en Banco Nación Ceres por ejemplo. Por tal motivo la intendencia de Ceres subió a Facebook una nota en la cual le pedían a Marcelo Sain -Ministro de seguridad que dijo que los homicidios narco en Rosario eran estacionales por ejemplo) que mande mas refuerzos para hacer efectiva la cuarentena, que fue dispuesta por orden de funcionarios de salud Santafesinos. Y Sain le respondió por Twitter ""que deje de hacer politiquería barata"". Tengo compañeros trabajando y es un descontrol la situación. No confiás ni en tu vecino. Yo zafé porque trabajo en Ceres pero los viernes a la siesta me voy a otra ciudad donde tengo mí familia. Y esto saltó el sábado. Bah, en la joda del viernes a la noche. Como ahora no puedo entrar, desde el lunes estoy licenciado por ""fuerza mayor"". Paraba en un hotel, y ese hotel está cerrado por seguridad. Igual, los colectivos siguieron llegando y saliendo desde Ceres. Hoy la cosa está mas estricta, y solo entran camiones de mercadería, droguerías, y no mucho más. No sería raro que el primer clúster del país, (me refiero a la posibilidad de circulación comunitaria) salga de esa fiesta, es cuestión de horas saberlo, y espero por mí trabajo, mis compañeros, etc... que no termine en lo peor."

For instance, while the coronavirus may be naturally occurring, it is still plausible that the Chinese biolab (literally less than 1000 meters from the supposed ground zero market) had samples of it from bats/pangolins, it infected someone in the lab, and they went to the market and it spread from there by pure accident. I’m not trying to say it was malicious, but that China may well have been meddling with this in a lab and it got out—without being artificially engineered.

Either way, that’s not really important now. What is important is that China *has* destroyed samples of the virus (along with other means of trying to slow the path to a cure) and has threatened to cut off medical supplies to the West, while also insinuating that the virus was planted in China by the US Army (and Twitter has refused to take that statement down). So, China is certainly not the good guy no matter how you approach this."

During  these uncertain times of school closings and self-quarantining, one  thing that is certain is the proliferation of scams and malicious  content related to the COVID-19 outbreak. As the necessity of working  remotely from home has become a reality, these scams pose an even  greater threat to our workforce and institution. Some examples of this  threat include:

* emails impersonating the WHO and the CDC,
* fraudulent websites      advertising protective medical equipment,
* attackers seeking funding      for ‘vaccine research,’ and
* charities asking for      donations.

A  leading security firm found that 4,000 Coronavirus-related domains have  been registered globally since January 2020—3 percent were malicious.  In addition, the U.S. State Department warned that Russia was  responsible for “swarms of online, false personas” seeking to spread  misinformation on social media.

How can we protect ourselves from falling for these malicious scams?

* Be skeptical – don’t use any information on a suspicious      website to verify its authenticity.
* Be vigilant – never      submit personal information or login credentials via email or on a      website.
* Never click on suspicious      links or attachments.
* Call the person who      purportedly sent the message and verify they did send it.
* Review the suggestions at      our website, “[Don’t      Get Hooked](https://www.it.cuimc.columbia.edu/information-security/dont-get-hooked).”

however, its still is just that. circumstantial. what we do have evidence for is that these diseases occur naturally already, and, as shown in the original article, is very unlikely was a lab grown virus as its... novel - you know, thats why they also call it ""novel coronavirus"".

In the darkness of the early hours Monday, about a dozen immigration agents gathered outside a Starbucks in Bell Gardens.

For the Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers, who make daily arrests, it was supposed to be business as usual.

But that morning, they greeted one another with elbows instead of handshakes; the Starbucks where they rendezvoused was only grab and go; and they passed freeway signs that read: “Wash your hands stay healthy avoid COVID-19.”

The ICE agents were about to spend the day trying to arrest targets on a most unusual of days: the day after the California governor and L.A. mayor ordered people to ramp up their efforts of social distancing over the coronavirus. The agents had N95 respirator masks in their vehicles, just in case.

With safety measures taken across the state, immigrant advocates have criticized ICE for its continued enforcement operations. More than 45 organizations signed a letter this week calling on the Department of Homeland Security to suspend such actions.

ICE said it would take precautions, given the new reality. But the arrests would go on.

“We’re out here trying to protect the public by getting these criminal aliens off the street and out of our communities,” said David Marin, the director of Enforcement and Removal Operations for ICE in L.A. “Asking us to stop doing that basically gives those criminals another opportunity to maybe commit more crimes, to create more victims.”

In the parking lot, the group of agents stood in a loose circle — not quite six feet apart — as they reviewed the target list. That morning, they were searching for four people, including two registered sex offenders.

Among the gathered officers were two U.S. Customs and Border Protection officers — identifiable only by a patch on their vest with their agency’s name. They were among nine total CBP agents and officers deployed to the L.A. area in the last few weeks to assist ICE in making arrests.

They rattled off the height, weight and daily routines of the people they sought to arrest. Nearly all the targets lived within a one-mile radius. With many schools closed due to coronavirus and some people staying home from work, it was unclear how arrests would go that morning.

“We couldn’t factor this in, right? This COVID-19 and the precautions that everybody’s taking,” Marin said. “We just have to continue to go with the same game plan that we’ve been doing.”

All of the officers had been issued the protective masks over the past few weeks. In his car, Marin kept packets of hand sanitizer wipes, which he’d used that morning to wipe down his steering wheel, his keys and his hands after pumping gas.

Around 5 a.m., the officers waited outside of Pedro Castillo Bravo’s home. He was convicted in 2015 for DUI causing bodily injury and hit and run.

The officers knew the 56-year-old would soon be heading out to work collecting metal. In less than an hour, they spotted movement in the driveway.

“I can’t tell if it’s the target or not, but they got into the target vehicle,” an officer’s voice crackled over the radio. After Castillo prepared to leave, an officer knocked on his car door.

He asked if Castillo was sick or taking medication, to which he said no. He asked him if he’d been arrested before and Castillo admitted he had. The officer, who wore a pair of black gloves, handcuffed Castillo and placed him in the back of a white Dodge Challenger.

Since the 2015 conviction, Castillo said, he had not driven again drunk. That morning, after work, he planned to visit the grocery store — worried about the lack of food at home and the stores emptying amid panic buying.

“I’m the head of the house,” Castillo said, growing teary eyed. “If they have me here locked up, what about rent and food?”

Shortly after 6 a.m., the officers were at the next home on Lanto Street, where they looked for a man who had been convicted of sexual battery and sentenced to three years’ summary probation. When ICE pulled him over, he told them he had a green card.

His crime, Marin said, made him removable. Officers placed the man in the backseat beside Castillo.

As a few officers took the men to be processed, the rest went to door knock in a nearby mobile home park. They were searching for a man convicted of receiving stolen property and conspiracy to commit a crime. Instead, they encountered his wife and two children, both home from school that day because of closures.

“We’re the only ones here,” the man’s wife told the officer, allowing him to come inside and look around.

After striking out, the agents circled back to Starbucks for coffee and a bathroom break. Inside, staff were not allowing customers to put their own cream or sugar, to help stop the spread of coronavirus. And the bathroom they’d been waiting for was closed to the public — badge or no.

As the officers stood outside, a man approached them to ask if it was “true that the sheriff got the coronavirus?” The officers said no. Throughout the day, they spotted people wearing masks and others with arms full of toilet paper and paper towels.

Coronavirus has had effects across the agency.

In the building where Marin works downtown, officials have talked about limiting contact with the public. On Tuesdays and Thursdays there are 150 people who cram into a waiting room and line up outside against the wall for check-ins with ICE, some of them arriving every 30 days.

“We might have to adjust that and make it 60 or 90 days maybe, to limit their contact,” Marin said “We’ll work on that on a case-by-case basis.”

Homeland Security Investigations, a branch within Immigration and Customs Enforcement, postponed its citizens academy. Advanced classes at the Federal Law Enforcement Training Centers have been canceled. Marin’s meeting with faith-based leaders was canceled.

Over the weekend, Marin sat down with senior leadership to determine which jobs might allow staff to telework. Aside from mission support specialists, that seemed out of the question.

“Our job is not a job that you can telework from,” Marin said. “Processing people or doing check ins with people, that can’t be done via telework.”

Later that morning, officers waited outside the last house on their list that day. They usually saw their target leave his home between 8:45 and 9. But that morning, they waited an hour and a half and never saw him.

“This guy’s late,” Marin said, speculating that he’d changed his pattern “because of coronavirus.”

But the biggest change became clear as Marin drove downtown on the 110 north.

“Where is the traffic?” he asked."

By limiting tests, [disbanding the pandemic response team](https://theintercept.com/2020/03/14/trump-says-no-idea-pandemic-response-team-disbanded-thats-true/), and [denying the crisis](https://apnews.com/00d26ad5b6caa82716b52d01a0f8f8b7), the goverment encouraged people to continue going out and getting infected. 

By ignoring the CDC's advice on [flying exposed and infected passengers together on the same flight home](https://www.thedailybeast.com/cdc-warned-against-flying-coronavirus-infected-americans-back-to-the-us-report-says) and then quarantining at Travis Air Force Base with [defective medical equipment and inadequate training](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/27/us/politics/coronavirus-us-whistleblower.html) they on their own started an infection cluster in California.

Interestingly, Alex Azar, head of the Department of Health, also helped [remove protections against price gouging](https://theintercept.com/2020/03/13/big-pharma-drug-pricing-coronavirus-profits/) if a publicly funded vaccine were produced. So basically he cleared the way for Eli Lilly to make a fortune off Coronavirus. More or less, Trump put the pharma exec who would profit from a massive pandemic in charge of the department that would be combating it.

EDIT: Also the Trump admin [refused to take offers of assistance from governments like South Korea](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-03-15/south-korea-wants-to-share-its-tips-on-tackling-the-coronavirus), who seemingly arrested growth of the disease. The CDC tried to [develop their own defective and untried test kit](https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/what-went-wrong-with-coronavirus-testing-in-the-us) instead of using the one provided by the WHO. Which is why South Korea has among the fastest test results time in the world.

It would take several hours to list all the colossal screw ups that went down at the federal level. From out-of-control austerity measures to what appears to be bad-faith actors like Alex Azar. This is perhaps the worst avoidable disaster to occur in US history."

**TLDR Genetic analysis rules out genetic engineering.  Virologists know extremely well how to tell apart engineered genes from natural genes.  SARS-Cov-2 very clearly is genetically natural.**

- If the virus had a known “lab base virus” as origin, or markers of “lab engineering techniques”, then we would consider lab origin a possibility.  _But SARS-Cov-2 does not._ 

- If the virus were “better designed” then we would consider lab origin a possibility.  _But SARS-Cov-2 is not._

- If the virus didn’t have obvious genealogical connections to the many other coronavirus strains, especially the 7 known to have animal->human transmissibility, then we would consider lab origin a possibility.  _SARS-Cov-2 has obvious genealogical connection to naturally selected viruses, so natural selection is overwhelmingly likely._

There might be other arguments in the article that I missed, but the authors are clear in conclusion and throughout.  Based on genomic analysis (something that cannot be faked): 

- there is zero evidence of lab origin
- there is ample evidence _against_ lab origin
- there is ample evidence of natural origin"

Two cases of coronavirus were confirmed in Monterey County today by Public Health Officer Dr. Ed Moreno, who also issued a Shelter in Place order for all residents of Monterey County “to enhance measures already being taken to slow the spread of novel coronavirus in our county and preserve critical health care capacity.”  


The order will begin “tonight at midnight and last for three weeks,” the county said.  


“Temporarily making these drastic changes to our lives and routines may be frustrating, but it is critical to slowing the spread of this virus,” said Moreno. “We must weigh the loss of some freedoms we enjoy with the ability to separate healthy people who may not show symptoms from those at risk who may be inadvertently exposed.”  


This order is similar to ones issued yesterday by six San Francisco Bay area counties, limiting activity, travel and business function to the most essential needs; essential businesses and operations should remain open. The order does not affect essential government services — services to protect the health, safety and welfare of communities. It also makes provision for our agricultural community and fieldworkers who keep food in our markets and on our table and provide other products for personal consumption.  


According to Moreno, you can also leave your home for specified reasons to make sure you have the necessities of life such as getting food and medical supplies. You are also allowed to go outside to take care of pets, go on a walk, and just get outside, so long as you do not congregate in a group and maintain at least six feet of distance between you and other people."

Sun Yu in Beijing

Chinese farmers face a daunting planting season as they grapple with a shortage of labour, seed and fertiliser in the wake of a nationwide lockdown to control the spread of coronavirus.

A Qufu Normal University survey last month of village officials in 1,636 counties found that 60 per cent of respondents were pessimistic or very pessimistic about the planting season.

The dismal mood has raised fears of a food shortage in the world’s most populous nation after disease control measures, led by traffic restrictions, took a toll on farming activity.

“China’s agricultural industry has collapsed without the free flow of labour and raw materials,” said Ma Wenfeng, an analyst at CnAgri, a consultancy in Beijing.

Chinese farms rely heavily on migrant workers and are struggling to find enough labourers after public transport was suspended to help stem the outbreak.

Less than a third of local adults from 104 villages in 12 inland provinces had travelled outside their hometown for work after the lunar new year, according to Wuhan university. Normally, between 80 and 90 per cent of adults would be working elsewhere.

hat has created problems for Wang Heqing, owner of a 94-hectare farm in the southern Guangdong province. He said 80 per cent of his workers were trapped at home in the western province of Guizhou because of the travel restrictions.

Instead of growing cabbage and sweetcorn, as he had planned, Mr Wang switched to rice, which is less labour intensive. But rice sells for a fraction of the price of vegetables.

“Labour shortages have dealt a heavy blow to vegetable farms in Guangdong,” said Mr Wang, “but we have to work with what we have.”

Farmers also face a shortage of fertilisers and seeds. The problem is especially pronounced in Hubei province, the country’s largest fertiliser producer and the centre of the coronavirus outbreak.

Local factories have struggled to reopen as a result of the travel restrictions, which have been maintained despite a decline in the official number of new virus cases.

An executive at Beifeng Agricultural Production Means Group, a big fertiliser distributor, said northeastern provinces, which produce most of the nation’s grain, face a shortage of 1.3m tonnes of phosphate fertilisers, or 40 per cent of annual consumption.

“We are going to have trouble maintaining agricultural output at a safe level if the shortfall doesn’t ease in the coming 30 days,” said the official.

Analysts said a sharp fall in agricultural output, especially of grain, risked exacerbating food inflation, which hit a 12-year high of 21.9 per cent in February. That would present a political challenge to the ruling Communist party, which has already been accused of covering up the epidemic.

“Chinese people may grumble when pork prices double,” said a Beijing-based scholar, “but they will rise up against the party if rice prices take off.”"

First, your original misleading article concerns **breathing** and not **talking**. This paper is concerned with **talking**.

Even worse, this paper is concerned with the physiological factors that influence the emission of particles from a mouth. **It is not concerned with the classification of viruses as droplet-borne or aerosol-borne**. And it has *nothing* to do with the SARS-CoV-2 virus.

Do you even understand what it is about viruses that can make them airborne before you're posting this shit?

Do you understand why measles is airborne and incredibly contagious while many other viruses (such as ebola) are not? It's because the physical properties of the measles virus allows it to stay suspended in the air for up to 2 hours. **SARS-CoV-2 can not meaningfully be transmitted as an aerosol**, despite its ability to exist for short periods of time as an aerosol during very specific medical procedures involving intubation.

Here is a little bit more clarifying information:
> The weight of the evidence suggests that the new coronavirus can exist as an aerosol — a physics term meaning a liquid or solid (the virus) suspended in a gas (like air) — **only under very limited conditions, and that this transmission route is not driving the pandemic.**
[Source](https://www.statnews.com/2020/03/16/coronavirus-can-become-aerosol-doesnt-mean-doomed/)

Just for anyone reading this other than OP:

- COVID-19 **can not** be spread by breathing

- COVID-19 **can** be spread by someone talking and interacting in front of someone else... this is *not* news and does not mean that the disease is transmitted as an aerosol

- the virus **can only be transmitted as an aerosol (aka through breathing) during specific aerosol-generating medical procedures on COVID-19 patients, during which N95 masks are required by front-line medical personnel**

1) short term deal/less risk

5) we can still draft a QB"
2020-03-17,someaccount467,stocks,9,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/fk71li/dead_cat_bounce_today/fkrfvm3/,"Well, here’s a long answer...

Prior to coronavirus, markets were trading at a premium. Everyone was waiting for that crash. Take the S&P 500 for example. It was trading at 19x forward earnings. Typically, it hovers around 15x. So things were already expensive.

So what was driving the price?

(Please no politics) Trump cut taxes for corporations. They had much more capital. Meanwhile, interest rates are still low. So corporations had tons of cash to buy back stock. They also could take cheap loans to buy more stock. Corporations were the biggest stock purchasers during this rise. Everyone saw these stock prices climbing steadily. So people jumped in adding to the price hikes.

So the coronavirus. And global panic. Corporations are now worried about having cash flow to survive. So they unload stock for cash and to preserve returns. 

But now we have some major problems. Corporate debt is at an all time high. Some 15% of companies are zombie companies. Meaning they are floated by debt and can’t pay their own debt. With massive reductions in earnings, companies will struggle heavily. This isn’t a 1-3 month problem. 

Next, we have baby boomers that are panicked. They can’t weather a depression. Many have pulled out of stocks. Most will likely not be willing to go back into stocks.

The oil battle with Russia and Saudi is 100% because Russia wants US Oil to crash. Russia used to be above the US in production and Saudi kept prices high to keep profits high which allowed US shale to flourish. US became fully energy independent and a net exporter. That destroyed Russia’s sector. What no one is doing now is pricing in an environment where US is reliant on foreign energy. That is a concern to me. 

So going forward, here’s what we have to worry about. Q1 earnings are complete garbage. Not to be trusted at all. Bad companies get to blame coronavirus. Good companies are overshadowed by the virus. The lockdown goes into Q2, and Q2 is the same boat. So we have to wait for Q3 earnings, which get released in October. Any investing before then is being done so with very little data. 

If we wipe out all earnings from Q1 and set growth to 0% for Q2-Q4. The S&P 500, priced at 15x forward earnings gives us an estimate of 1850–25% below prices today. Everyone is just trying to figure out if the outlook is better or worse than 0 Q1, and 0% growth rest of year. If it’s worse, that 1850 goes down.

We also have to worry about the fed lowering rates much faster than expected and stimulus packages. This most certainly will lead to inflation. The market hasn’t had to deal with inflation for years. While this won’t necessarily mean more stock price lowering, some companies do worse than other in inflation.

So all of this makes it hard to look at a green day with optimism with all the uncertainty."

2020-03-17,tlk23,news,9,https://www.reddit.com/r/news/comments/fiusxv/covid19_megathread_6/fks16n1/,"It is interesting to see where the tipping point is in a society. Anywhere from 20-30+ million people in the U.S. get the flu each season. Deaths from the flu have ranged from 30,000 to 60,000 in recent years. Just a year or two ago, 60,000 people in the U.S. died from the flu, the most in decades.

Relatively speaking, it's a very low percentage (0.10%) that actually die from the flu considering the tens of million of people that get it each year. However, it's still tens of thousands that die. We really don't change our every day lives because of those tens of thousands that die every year. Society goes on. We don't postpone or cancel events because a 0.10 percentage of the population that has the flu ends up dead or because 10 percent of the U.S. population has the flu. Life goes on, uninterrupted.

The coronavirus is much more deadly (1%-2% death rate) and contagious. Nobody in modern times, going back 100+ years, has experienced what we are going through now. A lot of the country and society are at a stand still. People are out of work. Kids are out of school. This is expected to be the new normal for at least the next two months.

Medical experts and other leaders have drawn a line and said that the potential loss of life is too great to continue society as normal with a 1% to 2% death rate. It doesn't seem like a lot, but going back to normal flu numbers, if 20-30 million people were to get the coronavirus, the loss of life may be 250,000 or more. Some extreme estimates of 75 million U.S. cases and a million deaths seems a bit much to me. I don't think we'll come close those numbers because of the precautions that are taking place currently. When it's all said and done, the cases in the U.S. may be over 10,000 (currently at 4,700) with deaths approaching 1,000 (currently at 100). We'll wait and see.

Going back to my original point, It is interesting to see where the tipping point is in a society. 60,000 flu deaths a year or two ago was not enough to change our lives. Does it have to be 100,000 dead? 250,000? A million? It turns out a 1 percent fatality rate is that tipping point based on the past couple of weeks.

Are we overreacting? Maybe? That's up for you to decide. Everyone's life is different. Your life may be changing a lot or maybe not much at all due to recent developments and restrictions. If things don't turn out as bad as you may think, then that probably means our isolation worked in slowing down the spread of the virus.

I don't know of anyone that is happy with the new restrictions in life, but it's the way things are for the forceable future."
2020-03-17,TeuszyW,Coronavirus,9,https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/fk5m07/daily_discussion_post_march_17_questions_images/fkrmnm3/,"(27m) Just came back from my polling place in Illinois. Every single volunteer there was in the high-risk age. There were several people coughing and while there were measures being taken (sanitizing pens, hand sanitizer available when you walked in), it really should have been postponed considering the time and who was volunteering. As I was walking out there was a middle-aged couple walking in and I put some hand sanitizer on my hands and the male mockingly goes ""there's the coronavirus right there."" 

Americans around the country are being so naive about this. While I hope it doesn't explode the way worst case models have shown, part of me wants these people not taking this thing seriously to have it impact their life in a way where it's devastating. In a way where it might actually provide some fucking humility and general human decency. Am I an awful person for this? Is it hypocritical of me? Ugh. Go Bernie."

6 months is covered assuming everyone has more than one person at home. 

For example, I live with 3 other people. If one of them catches coronavirus, they're in 2 weeks isolation...along with the rest of us. Then another family member catches it...that's another two weeks, the third family member catches it...+2 more weeks, then the last member catches it...overall, that's 8 weeks in isolation or approx. 2months.

If you have larger families or live in extended family homes with multiple generations, then it will take longer for a disease to ""sweep through"" said families.

I imagine 6 months is an approximate time-frame hoping all of this shit has done exactly that, meanwhile we have a nobody in-nobody out immigration policy to double down on it.

As for public transport...well, we should have looked into designated quarantine areas similar to Christmas Island and the Darwin mining camp long before this."
