>President Donald Trump on Saturday suggested health care workers sanitize and reuse masks when treating coronavirus patients, rather than ""throwing away"" masks that are in short supply.

>""I have to tell you, the throwing away of the masks, being in private business, the throwing away of the mask right away, they're throwing it away,"" Trump said during Saturday's White House coronavirus briefing.

>New York state is sending 1 million masks to NYC, Gov. Cuomo says
Suggesting that health care workers instead clean and reuse the masks, the President said: ""We have very good liquids for doing this, sanitizing the masks, and that that's something they're starting to do more and more. They're sanitizing the masks.""
It is unclear which type of mask the President was describing, but US Food and Drug Administration guidelines for the common N95 respirator masks state they ""should not be shared or reused.""

>FDA authorizes new test that could detect coronavirus in about 45 minutes

>Neither the FDA nor Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines suggest the possibility of sanitizing masks for safe reuse.
During the briefing, Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, cautioned that hospitals should consult the CDC's guidelines for extended use and limited reuse of N95 masks. But Fauci, a doctor for the National Institutes of Health for more than 50 years, did not discount the idea of reuse.
""There are CDC guidances about how you can minimize the use of masks by different things that you could do with testing and when you have masks, how you might reuse them, which ones you can reuse,"" Fauci said.

>In fact, the CDC's guidance on coronavirus does mention ""limited re-use of facemasks,"" but cautions ""it is unknown what the potential for contact transmission is"" for coronavirus. It also states that ""not all facemasks can be re-used""

So the rest of March and probably April will be a bloodbath.
More circuit breakers will be hit.
And Trump will keep fucking everything up."

I assume the logic goes something like ""200 million people get infected and 1.5% of that population dies.""

I don't think the numbers bear that out at all. [The United States has a Case Fatality Rate right now of 1.245%](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/world/coronavirus-maps.html#us), and when we aren't testing entire basketball teams our testing is being done only on obviously symptomatic people with a connection to another infected person. That means that the actual CFR is far lower (although we do need to wait for all cases to resolve) since we are barely detecting less severe cases and aren't detecting asymptomatic cases at all.

How much lower? Take a look at Germany which has one of the highest test rates per capita (because of course they do...). While the US struggled to get testing off the ground, Germany has been testing [12,000 people a day](https://euobserver.com/coronavirus/147830) ([compared to ~65k *total* in the US](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/cases-updates/testing-in-us.html)). Remember that Germany is only 1/4th the size of the US!

[The CFR in Germany is currently 0.276%](https://www.rki.de/DE/Content/InfAZ/N/Neuartiges_Coronavirus/Fallzahlen.html), and even they aren't detecting asymptomatic cases. It is very likely that the true CFR is less than 0.1%, perhaps significantly less.

Now, people say that overwhelming the medical system will lead to a higher fatality rate, and that's likely true. But normal causes of hospitalization and death aren't going away either and the longer hospitals are in coronavirus mode the more likely you are to die of a heart attack or a stroke. ""Flattening the curve"" and prolonging the epidemic might lead to fewer deaths due to lack of ventilators but more deaths due to internal bleeding while doctors are dealing with the pandemic.

If the CFR does end up at around 0.1%, which might still be an overestimate, every single person in the United States could be infected and 'only' 327,200 would die. Not to be heartless, but most of those deaths would be people with short life expectancy.

>Pro  Publica March 17. As of 2018, Greenville, SC had 2,220 total  hospital  beds, of which about 64% were occupied, potentially leaving  only 800  beds open for additional patients. The bed count includes 280  beds in  intensive care units, according to data from the American  Hospital  Association and the American Hospital Directory. Intensive care  units  are best equipped to handle the most acute coronavirus cases.  
The  Greenville, SC region has a population of about 961,000 residents;  16%  are over the age of 65. The experience in other countries has shown   that elderly patients have significantly higher hospitalization and   fatality rates from the coronavirus.  
In  the moderate scenario, in which 40% of the adult population contracts   the disease over 12 months, Greenville, SC would be among the regions   that would need to expand capacity.  
It  is estimated that about 8% of the adult population would require   hospital care. In a moderate scenario where 40% of the population is   infected over a 12-month period, hospitals in Greenville, SC would   receive an estimated 62,300 coronavirus patients. The influx of patients   would require 2,080 beds over 12 months, which is 2.6 times the   available beds in that time period. The Harvard researchers' scenarios   assume that each coronavirus patient will require 12 days of hospital   care on average, based on data from China.  
In  the Greenville, SC region, intensive care units would be especially   overwhelmed and require additional capacity. Without coronavirus   patients, there are only 41 available beds on average in intensive care   units, which is 11 times less than what is needed to care for all  severe  cases.  
For the analysis,  Jha and his team selected various rates of infection  and modeled  hospital capacity for each over three time periods, six  months, 12  months and 18 months. The infection rate scenarios are based  on  estimates from leading epidemiologist Dr. Marc Lipsitch, head of the   Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health’s Center for Communicable   Disease Dynamics, who made the projections of how many people globally   would be infected.  
By modeling the  data over the three time periods, the scenarios  illustrate how much  the nation could “flatten the curve” with social  measures to ensure  hospitals have greater capacity to care for  coronavirus patients.  
“The  way to permanently stop new cases from setting off long chains of   transmission is to have each case infect considerably less than one case   on average,” Lipsitch said. “The numbers will go down. There will  still  be little outbreaks, but not big ones.” ""

The supply shortage of masks is assumed due to the need to use disposable mask daily. But what if each American can wear one mask? Surely, with news that China is producing 100 million masks daily and with different companies increasing production, this can be done. When done along with social distancing, especially if every American were to wear one in public, one would think that it may at least help in preventing asymptomatic patients from coughing to other patients, along with preventing people from touching their faces. Also, culturally, when everyone wears a mask in public, it signifies that everyone is committed.  


For instance, what if each citizen owned two cotton masks and one surgeon mask that can fit inside a cotton mask? The cotton masks can be washed with soap and rotated between use. We are talking about putting in 1 trillion dollars to give universal income and making thousands of new ventilators. Giving one mask to 300 million American would be much more affordable solution that may help flatten the curve.  


Not trying to go against CDC or anything. Just was wondering if this idea made sense to other posters. There are a lot of states like Montana that are still relatively early in infection, and any public health measure, such as this, may help, especially knowing that the fight against coronavirus may take months. You can't go on lockdown forever.

2020-03-21,Steffilarueses,Anxiety,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/eupik4/coronavirus_megathread/fl4xasp/,"Hi all,

Greetings from California! We've been in shelter-in-place since Thursday night. And yes, going outside for exercise is okay per our governor and it's very easy to stay 6ft away from people where I am. 

I wanted to share this picture with you all from my run today, as well as some other positive things.

https://imgur.com/kNcFW8p

This is an overlook a few blocks from my house. The weather is amazing here today! Clear and breezy, birds are singing. Life is moving. People are walking and riding bikes, picking up curbside orders from my little downtown area restaurants, life is going on here, but people are also abiding by rules, at least in my area. Everyone is staying distanced from each other or staying inside. 

My partner drove this morning to pick up some food from a local restaurant that was putting together a curbside pickup BBQ package (tri-tip, chicken, and a pack of beer... we're probably having that for dinner). The place was also putting a ton of the same meals together to drop off at our local hospital for the staff there to make sure they're fed. We managed to get our Instacart delivery for groceries this morning. There were a few things they couldn't fulfill, but we still got plenty. 

Things are a little eerie and different but life is moving. People are helping each other. There are efforts in the world right now for people to sew masks for doctors and nurses. The FDA just approved a 45 minute COVID-19 test (https://www.cnbc.com/2020/03/21/fda-grants-emergency-use-coronavirus-test-that-can-deliver-results-in-45-minutes.html)

This past week I dropped some supplies off to an immunocompromised friend of mine (found her toilet paper and flour, which we're both hard to come by in her area for the past few weeks) and she baked me some thank you cookies. When I was grabbing her toilet paper in the brief window my local market had it, the few people in the aisle with me were grabbing one roll saying ""just getting one! Don't want to overbuy!"" - like they were aware. We all kind of laughed together.

My point in all this is not to diminish the gravity of all this. My point is if you look around, there are people helping. There are people giving. There are people desperate to help in the ways they can. Sure there are shitty people price-gouging and hoarding and being awful, but for every one of them there are ten other people donating food, checking on their families, sharing cooking and workout videos. When you find yourself trapped in the deluge of terrifying headlines and doom and gloom, do what Mr. Rogers reminded us to and ""look for the helpers."" Go search for some positive headlines. They're out there. The news just doesn't want you to see them. And not even ones about recoveries or treatments - ones about good humans going out of their way to make others lives easier during this time. 

We are okay. We have been through a lot in the world, and we'll get through this too. I hope you have a strong, healthy, and happy day!"

>I went in the back, and found her dead in her kitchen. For those of you not fortunate enough to have known her - know this: it's an immeasurable loss.  And seeing a woman I knew to be so full of life lying on the floor lifeless was devastating. I was afraid to touch her. I held her anyway.

Calling it ""Chinese virus"", is fairly innocuous, but it does some important political things for Trump.

First off, it fires up his base of racists and xenophobes. Hearing Trump criticize China is music to their ears, especially in a time when bigotry against Asian people is at a high point.

Secondly, it makes more moderate people, who may not be racist but just dislike the Chinese government intensely, agree with Trump; ""I don't see what the big deal is with Trump calling it the Chinese virus, it did come from China"" ""Calling it Chinese virus is a way to get back at the Chinese government"" etc.

Thirdly, it distracts Democrats and the media from talking about Trump's abysmal response to the pandemic, and baits them into engaging him on race, which is a subject that Trump is much more comfortable talking about.

The doomsday figure can finally be revealed as the reason why the ARLC chairman has repeatedly described the impact of the coronavirus infiltrating the game as “catastrophic”.

“I can't stress enough that our game has never faced a challenge like this,"" V'landys said this week.

“It could have catastrophic effects on us moving forward.

“Our money will only last so long and once it's extinguished, we are in big trouble. It depends on the scenario we’re faced with but if it’s a total closure, we haven’t got long at all.”

V’Landys released the $500m hammer blow to every club CEO in a phone conference call on Thursday in a bid for transparency among the clubs and to illustrate how dire the situation was for rugby league.

The head of the game also used the alarming figure as the main why he wants every player to take self-isolation measures seriously.

By keeping players healthy and continuing to play games, the NRL would “have a chance” of surviving, he said during the call.

The Daily Telegraph NRL podcast. Adam Mobbs, Dean Ritchie and Michael Carayannis discuss Brisbane’s surprise emergence as a potential 2020 NRL grand final host, Latrell Mitchell’s start to his Rabbitohs career and the coronavirus impact on rugby league.

V’landys told every club that by continuing to play games behind closed doors, the NRL’s financial losses would reach a smaller albeit still devastating $110 million.

The NRL has $147 million in the bank.

But without games being aired on television, the loss of around $13m per round in broadcast revenue from Fox Sports and Nine would floor the code.

The ARL Commission was able to determine the real threat of a $500 million loss after every club was ordered to provide financial modelling to NRL chief financial officer Tony Crawford.

Clubs were asked to provide every income stream of their business that would be affected by both playing on without crowds and also the shutting down of the competition.

The phone hook-up also included NRL CEO Todd Greenberg, who supported V’landys’ decision to break down the financial devastation that would unfold from suspending the premiership.

By encouraging clubs to analyse every part of their business to cut costs, which has already begun across every club, V’landys also told club bosses that the NRL was looking at a “savage reduction” of staff within League Central to save money.

The 16 club CEOs were also told that every ARL Commissioner would take a pay-cut equal to the percentage of the players if that process was to eventuate.

V’landys has been criticised for his quip that he planned to approach government for funding to keep the game alive by negotiating at $500 million and working down.

However, after assessing the financial status of every club and the entire code, it appears it was no joke."

 [https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/20/eradicated-coronavirus-mass-testing-covid-19-italy-vo](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/20/eradicated-coronavirus-mass-testing-covid-19-italy-vo) 

Key highlights ... Northern Town of Italy with 3000 Pop. Real life experiment conducted to test every single person. 3% (89) tested positive. Worryingly, ""asymptomatic or quasi-symptomatic subjects represent a good 70% of all virus-infected people"". Full and voluntary self quarantine (not just self isolation). 9 days later 6 tested positive and trending towards zero. Zero Community Transmission. Clinical mortality is substantially lower than real life mortality.

The researchers conclusion is ....

"" In the absence of specific therapies or a vaccine, quarantine, distancing and identification of asymptomatic carriers remain the only real measures to control this epidemic.  ""

At first you may think this is impossible to be applicable to major cities or the horse has bolted, myself and even the article acknowledges the former. However here's what I think are some obvious and less obvious takeaway. 

(1) This is **measurable** proof of asymptomatic or quasi-symptomatic positives. You can tell a less informed, irresponsible person who has close contact with and cares about a person of high risk of COVID19 mortality the risk the danger they pose even if initially they don't have symptoms.

(2) When I scenario build out how COVID19 will play out in future, I cannot escape the conclusion that closed countries, closed internal borders and quarantines will persist for the next 12-18 months regardless of what all governments are telling us now. COVID19 will leak through the weakest link in any quarantine (think Sub Sahara Africa) and it is impossible for COVID19 to be eradicated short of something akin to a worldwide roll out of a working vaccine like the smallpox vaccine. So the only choice to minimise the impact is actually to ramp up testing kits, aside from ventilators and personal protection equipment (PPE). 

(3) Expanding on testing. Some governments are already giving up on increasing testing, however that's an incorrect strategy. One effective strategy is to repurpose manufacturing capacity (with the vast numbers of coming jobless) to ramp up delivery and testing analysis. Testing methods and technologies will continue to improve. Human desperation and ingenuity will drive this. South Korea tests 20,000 a day already, with improved techniques, additional resources and a war footing - a tenfold increased in capacity is entirely possible and then it takes 275 days to test everyone in South Korea 55 Mil / 200k tests. You kill a giant in many, many small steps - and you get your neighbours to help out. (we sold 1.56 billion smartphones in 2018 - mass production is more powerful than most people understand)

(4) Once testing capacity exponentially increase, governments should test all health workers, and all arrivals first regardless of symptoms, then break the country into smaller components be it shire, council, province, town, suburb etc, test everyone there and slowly identify green zones, keeping strong quarantines to protect these greenzones from outside visitors while letting life and the economy recover in these green zones. To illustrate, Parts of China, Taiwan are effectively green zones already.

The population will baulk at the more and more imposition of freedoms, but think about historical war situations and even the day by day changing of your own mindset through COVID19, if explained well the population will do the right thing in time when there's an existential threat (not to humanity but definitely to our current way of life that's underpined by the economy). Can we really afford a big chunk of our population to not work for 12-18 months? notwithstanding the direct and indirect terrible human toll.

In short, don't give up on a strategy to ramp up testing a hundred fold or more. If may seem insurmountable and impossible today, I point you towards historical human mobilisation from the World War 2 efforts and the building of Pyramids...

Take care and stay safe."

U.S. hospitals are warning that they are so strapped for cash that without some financial relief, they will be unable to meet their payrolls in a matter of weeks and some could be forced to close just as coronavirus cases are surging.

The American Hospital Association and three hospital chief executives spanning the country said in a conference call Saturday that a federal directive this week to cancel elective procedures — to conserve scarce resources for patients with covid19 — is halting the type of services that produce the most revenue.

And their ability to buy critically needed supplies — from protective gear to more hospital beds — is being stymied by the fact that private vendors are requiring hospitals to pay cash upon delivery, which they say they lack the money to do.

This stark portrait of the ground-level reality for hospitals, in communities where the pandemic has penetrated and those where it has not yet seriously struck, comes as hospitals and other cornerstones of the U.S. health-care system are pleading with Congress to provide large-scale financial relief.

The American Hospital Association, the American Medical Association and the American Nurses Association are jointly urging Congress to provide hospitals and health systems $100 billion in emergency aid. The Federation of American Hospitals, the trade group for for-profit hospitals, issued a call Friday night for at least $225 billion in aid.

On Saturday’s conference call, J. Scott Graham, the chief executive of Three Rivers and North Valley hospitals in rural Washington State communities where the pandemic has not yet surged, said the cancellation of elective procedures means that “there are no patients coming. … As a result, all of the revenue that typically comes in to cover the cost of operating has dried up.”

Graham said that the hospital projects it will be able to meet its payroll for the next three or four weeks. But he said it has stopped paying its vendors and has been urging its local bank to extend its credit limit — unsuccessfully so far.

“If we don’t get some assistance in the next two weeks, we will have to start having conversations with doctors and nurses and our community” about the need to close, he said. “We are concerned we will not be able to be around, because of the financial hit we are taking, by the time the surge hits us.”

A hospital executive in a very different environment, LaRay Brown of One Brooklyn Health System, which serves mainly low-income patients in that New York City borough, said, “we have less than two weeks cash on hand.”

That system of three hospitals, nursing homes and community health centers anticipates extra costs of more than $30 million per month, she said. It is racing to set up tents for testing and screening, has hired additional staff as others are isolated or home caring for children, and needs somehow to fulfill a new order by New York Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo (D) to increase hospital bed capacity by 50 percent.

“We literally need to buy the beds,” Brown said. But with vendors insisting on being paid at the time they are delivered, she said, “we can’t buy the equipment … if we don’t have the immediate cash.”"

Link: https://www.santa-ana.org/coronavirus


READ THE EXECUTIVE ORDER WITH FULL RULES AND REQUIREMENTS

The City of Santa Ana has enacted a moratorium on all residential and commercial foreclosures and evictions for non-payment of rent for anyone who is unable to pay due to financial impacts related to COVID-19.

The Santa Ana City Council unanimously authorized the action on Tuesday, March 17, in a proclamation of local emergency. City Manager Kristine Ridge signed the executive order on Thursday, March 19, and it immediately went into effect.

The moratorium will remain in place as allowed under an executive order of the Governor of California through May 31, 2020, or longer if extended by the Governor.

The City of Santa Ana’s order includes the following:

Residential landlords who know a tenant can’t pay rent for reasons related to COVID-19 aren’t allowed to serve a notice of eviction or take other actions to evict a tenant for nonpayment of rent.

Commercial landlords are prohibited from charging rent and evicting commercial tenants for nonpayment of rent if the businesses are limited or closed to prevent or reduce the spread of COVID-19.

To show that the landlord knew of the tenant’s situation, the tenant must provide the landlord with notice in writing of lost income and inability to pay full rent due to financial impacts from COVID-19, along with documentation to support the claim. This must be provided within 30 days after the date that the rent is due.

The tenant is still responsible for the unpaid rent and must pay within six months of the expiration of the local emergency, under the executive order. A landlord can’t charge or collect a late fee for rent in these circumstances.

Foreclosures on residential and commercial properties are temporarily suspended. No foreclosure action shall be initiated during the local emergency against a property owner with a demonstrated financial impact related to COVID-19.

Water and sewer service can’t be shut off because of unpaid bills and late-payment penalties or fees can’t be charged.

No late-payment penalties will be charged for parking violations.

The local emergency resolution that allowed this eviction and foreclosure moratorium also closed City Hall and all other municipal buildings to the public, suspended street sweeping parking citations, waived late fees for all City-provided services, suspended the shut-off of City-provided utilities, and enacted other measures to protect the public.[READ THE EXECUTIVE ORDER WITH FULL RULES AND REQUIREMENTS](https://www.santa-ana.org/sites/default/files/cm/images/Executive%20Order%20on%20Evictions%20and%20Foreclosures.pdf)"

There will be 5 million in a first shipment, distributed in March, reaching 10 million in the coming weeks.

The intention of the ministry is to carry out, in the coming weeks, a kind of drive-thru of tests in the country, as is already done in South Korea. Anyone with symptoms of the disease will be able to go by car to call centers, pierce their fingers and collect drops of blood. The result comes out in a few minutes.

""This is a quick test, called a point of care. Let's take a droplet, as if it were a blood glucose test and the reaction will show whether or not the person has the coronavirus. This was only possible due to the evolution of science and companies are able to supply in large quantities "", underscored secretary Wanderson Oliveira.

Currently, the tests carried out in the country are considered relatively quick, but the chain of tests is more bureaucratic. ""The tests are different. The ones we bought from the Oswaldo Cruz Foundation (the 27 thousand) are tests that I need a technician and procedures to carry out. He is fast and is ready in an hour and a half, two hours, but a lot of work at all stages, ""said Oliveira."

>Wildlife markets represent a dangerous source of possible new infections that could undermine the prevention of SARS (figure). Game foods are believed to “enhance the vitality of the body,” and as Cantonese people consume a substantial amount of game as a tonic in cold weather, the wildlife markets in Guangzhou thrive in winter. Many markets are poorly managed and insanitary, so cross infection, interspecies transmission, amplification, genetic convergence, and mixing of coronavirus may be taking place. Animal traders standing in close proximity to these infected animals may be affected, as may the food processors who slaughter infected animals in restaurant kitchens, causing SARS-CoV to spread from wildlife to humans—after which it may spread from human to human, principally by drop-let transmission. **It is too early to conclude that the SARS threat is over. If no action is taken to control wildlife markets, the SARS-CoV organism may develop into an epidemic strain.**

Thanks to the new coronavirus, our plans for the future, once so clear and reasonable, now seem hazy and improbable.

Who knows when our kids will go back to school, or when we will return to the office? Nobody can say how long dine-in restaurants will remain closed, or when we can finally meet friends for a much-needed drink.

When can we pray with our congregations again? Throw a birthday party? Go to the movies?

And how long can we live with all this uncertainty and not lose our collective minds?

“It is very disorienting,” said Alison Holman, a health psychologist at UC Irvine. “It’s like reality isn’t reality right now.”

Life will return to normal, someday. But the end of this liminal time feels a long way off.

The social distancing measures we are all taking — avoiding crowds, staying at least 6 feet away from anyone we don’t live with — are not expected to end any time soon.

In a new report, researchers at Imperial College London said we may need to continue these behaviors until a vaccine becomes available. Experts say that’s probably 12 to 18 months down the road.

While it’s possible that these interventions could be relaxed earlier, they would have to be put back in place if case numbers were to rebound, the authors of the report said.

Dr. Jay Butler, deputy director for infectious disease at the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said there are many variables that will determine how long it will take for the pandemic to run its course. Still, he acknowledged that the most models suggest it will not abate for another year at least.

That forecast is hard to stomach. Can we really live in this heightened state of anxiety for the next 12 months?

Our brains are wired to plan for the future, and when that future becomes difficult to imagine, it can take a significant toll on our mental health, Holman said.

“If you sense that you don’t have a future, you don’t have hope,” she said.

Holman’s research has found that when people experience traumatic events like fires or mass shootings, their perception of time slows down. In addition, they become so focused on the present that the past and future seem to slip away.

Her work also revealed that people who are less oriented toward the future also have a higher sense of distress that can make them become depressed or anxious.

But there is something that can help: Connecting with friends and family.

She found that people who received social support in the two months after 9/11 were much more future-oriented on the one-year anniversary of the event than those who did not.

“Staying connected is a way to stay grounded,” she said. “It keeps you from being pulled into a state of sheer anxiety.”

Vaile Wright, a director of clinical research at the American Psychological Assn., said that while we may not like this new reality we find ourselves in, we can learn to accept it as part of a process called “habituation.”

Wright describes habituation as an adaptive quality “because your body recognizes it can’t stay in a heightened sense of arousal forever.”

“You will start to adapt and it will become less arousing,” she said.

When and if that might happen, however, depends on each individual.

The benefit of habituation is that it allows people to redirect their emotional energy away from fighting reality — and toward managing it.

“If you accept that this is how it is going to be for a period of time, then you can use your resources for self-care and taking care of people in your life,” she said.

To make it through the coronavirus crisis, she also recommends focusing on the positives: That the vast majority of people recover from COVID-19, that some countries have managed to slow the virus’ spread, and that these painful social distancing measures are ultimately about protecting others who may be more vulnerable than we are.

“It is a very altruistic thing to do,” she said.

Rheeda Walker, director of the Culture, Risk, and Resilience Lab at the University of Houston in Texas, said it is also important to be intentional about how you talk to yourself during this time of rapid change and uncertainty.

“Lets say you have kids at home,” she said. “On the one hand you can say, ‘I can’t get my job done with these little people in my house.’ Or you can say, “This is what it is, now how do I make this work.’”

It won’t be easy, she added, so don’t beat yourself up if your early attempts to adjust to life in a pandemic aren’t entirely smooth.

“We may have to experiment a bit,” Walker said. “Just because it doesn’t work doesn’t mean nothing is going to work, so you continue to experiment and figure out what works.”"

The intelligence reports didn’t predict when the virus might land on U.S. shores or recommend particular steps that public health officials should take, issues outside the purview of the intelligence agencies. But they did track the spread of the virus in China, and later in other countries, and warned that Chinese officials appeared to be minimizing the severity of the outbreak.

Taken together, the reports and warnings painted an early picture of a virus that showed the characteristics of a globe-encircling pandemic that could require governments to take swift actions to contain it. But despite that constant flow of reporting, Trump continued publicly and privately to play down the threat the virus posed to Americans. Lawmakers, too, did not grapple with the virus in earnest until this month, as officials scrambled to keep citizens in their homes and hospitals braced for a surge in patients suffering from covid-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus.

In your post, I think you sound the most excited about Oxford and Amherst.  Oxford I think has both the biggest pros and cons. You're right that the coronavirus and being in a foreign country could change some things, and obviously there is a competitive academic atmosphere at top schools like Oxford, which may be different at a LAC or Jesuit institution with more holistic academics. As a Massachusetts resident, I know several people who go to Amherst who are absolutely brilliant and love it so much. Amherst the town is definitely not Boston, but because there are so many colleges in the area, it is a really fun and vibrant place to be. You'll find all your staples: cute cafes, insomnia cookies, etc. In terms of reputation, Amherst is one of the top LACs, has a really stellar rep and the people I know who have since graduated had no problems getting great internships, although they studied econ and physical sciences, not poli sci.

This kind of money would be life changing and will help out whomever immensely.   

Currently I’m living out in a small little rural area without a job and down to my last bit of money.   Every day I feel like I’m on the verge of a full blown mental breakdown.  Worrying about how bills will be paid, worrying if I’ll even have a car in a few months when the money finally runs out, how will we provide for ourselves and our pups.  Everything looks bleak and my days are overcome with anxiety and trying to keep it all together.  My fiancé and I moved out here so she could be closer with her family (her grandmother needed someone to be there with her during chemo for lung cancer and to help her mom with her three brothers).  We’ve worked odd jobs around this small town to make a few dollars here and there.  With the coronavirus pandemic it’s been hard to find anything stable.  We were fortunate enough that her grandparents had a house on their farm we could stay at to help lower expenses.   

Winning this contest I will aid her grandparents to knock out some of their medical bills so they don’t have to worry about it.  I will help my parents out back home to cover their living expenses until this pandemic passes and the country is back to some sense of normalcy.  My younger sister works at a hospital as a nurses assistant while she goes through nursing school.  I will donate money towards them to aid in getting groceries and supplies for staff that needs them.  Often times the hours at a hospital are crazy and they can’t beat the crowds or lines to get groceries.  Having someone get them while they’re working during this pandemic would be a godsend no doubt.  Lastly I would use the money to put myself through school and pay off all of my current debt.  I want to get my EMT-B certification and on to paramedic school after that.  I know it’s a low paying career generally but I want to help people that need aid.  To be the calming voice in someone’s darkest hour to guide them throughly safely.  That is why I want to pursue a life as a paramedic.  Winning this contest would undoubtedly help tremendously."

DALTON, Ga. — Dalton Mayor David Pennington told the Dalton Daily Citizen newspaper on Thursday that he considers dramatic steps taken to stop the spread of the COVID-19 virus is ""hysteria.""

The mayor's quote appears near the end of an article with the headline ""Restaurants move to delivery, curbside pickup to woo conoravirus-wary customers.""

The paper quotes Pennington as saying he still dines out, and is disappointed to see so few people.

""I was at (Cyra's) Tuesday, took some city people down there,"" he said. ""We were the only people in the restaurant. I go to the Oakwood every morning. Normally, there's a bunch of people on the side I sit on. Now, I'm the only one on that side. This is hysteria. I don't deny that vulnerable people need to self-quarantine — the elderly, people with heath conditions. but the rest of us don't,"" Pennington is quoted as saying.
NewsChannel 9 has reached out to Pennington's office for comment on this story, and we will share his response once we hear back.

As of Saturday at 12 p.m., there is one confirmed case of COVID-19 in Whitfield County. Hamilton Medical Center announced the case on Wednesday. In response, Whitfield County leaders declared a State of Emergency in response to the positive case. That declaration curtailed Whitfield County government services to its citizens, particularly cancelling in-person visits and closing public buildings that are non-essential. Restaurants and bars were not mentioned in the county's State of Emergency declaration.

On Thursday, Georgia Governor Brian Kemp updated Georgians on his efforts to contain the virus. Earlier in the week, Kemp declared a statewide State of Emergency, urging all public schools to close for the time being.

While that update from Kemp did not specifically address going out to a restaurant to dine in, it does say ""To stop the spread of coronavirus, we must follow the guidance from federal and state health organizations and leaders: regularly wash your hands, practice social distancing, protect the elderly and chronically ill, and stay home, especially if you are sick. If you are experiencing symptoms consistent with COVID-19, call your doctor or an urgent care clinic. Do not show up at the emergency room or your doctor’s office unannounced.""

The Atlanta Journal Constitution reports that during an interview on radio station Q99.7, Kemp said he “can’t just shut things [like restaurants] down,"" because he's trying to avoid a public overreaction.

The governor went on to say that he is not currently seeking relief incentives from the state for struggling businesses, but still asks Georgians to keep supporting small businesses and restaurants.



In a video posted Wednesday to his official Facebook page, Kemp stood in front of a table filled with fast food from Atlanta’s iconic Varsity restaurant in Midtown. He encouraged people to order takeout and delivery from Georgia restaurants to practice social distancing.

On Thursday, Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms announced on Twitter that she has signed an executive order limiting restaurants to take-out service, closing bars, gyms, and other areas of gathering.

Local cities, including Chattanooga, East Ridge and Soddy-Daisy, have now instituted a ban on dine-in options for all local restaurants, with options still available for take-out and delivery. Gyms and fitness centers in all three of those communities are also closed (with those restrictions going into effect in Soddy-Daisy at midnight on Saturday).

We have reached out to Mayor Pennington for comment. If and when we hear back from him, we will update this story."

Anti-vaxxers are largely comprised of people who never had to experience widespread outbreaks of diseases. They've reaped the benefits of vaccinations, and now speak out against them from a position of privilege and ignorance.

The coronavirus pandemic, while caused by a disease that somewhat blindsided us before a vaccine (or cure) could be developed, gives us a taste of what a world without vaccines would be like. Replace coronavirus with polio, measles, whatever -- it might not be quite as widespread, but it might be your kids dying instead of your grandparents. Or both, most diseases don't discriminate the way covid does.

If/when a coronavirus vaccine is developed, I'd hope anti-vaxxers would change their tunes having seen first-hand what a pandemic looks like."

Israeli media report that 88-year-old Arie Even moved from Hungary to Israel in 1949. He died Friday.

He was one of several residents and staff at a retirement home in Jerusalem to catch the coronavirus, after a social worker reportedly caught the virus from a French visitor at a wedding.

His family said they were saddened not to be able to be with him during his final days. They were asked to stay away in order to not catch the virus.

""He was a beloved and dear man, lived a full life, was dedicated to his family, and showed strength until his very last moments,"" his son said in a statement published by the Israeli daily Haaretz. ""We lament that he had to spend his last moment without his family by his side.""

Hopefully, lockdown measures have been effective at slowing the pandemic down so that our healthcare system isn’t overwhelmed. It likely won’t be until several weeks have passed until we know the true scale of what we are dealing with.

Even if we have managed to prevent the worst-case scenarios from happening, we have not managed to figure out an effective response to the **economic crisis** that the pandemic has placed upon America’s working class.

[**Bernie believes we are likely already in a recession**](https://www.facebook.com/berniesanders/photos/a.664931670228507/2935436713177980/?type=3&theater): one that demands **immediate** political action to stave off the worst consequences.

Recently, the Federal Reserve announced that it would be [creating $1 trillion a day to give to the banks](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/03/12/fed-to-pump-more-than-500-billion-into-short-term-bank-funding-expand-types-of-security-purchases.html).

We not only need a relief program that goes beyond what policymakers implemented in 2007–2008, but one that can evolve into something more sustainable and permanent after the crisis has subsided.

Will that money be used to bail out America’s financial institutions and wealthy elite to the exclusion of everyone else, or will we find a way to make it more inclusive this time around?

**Berne’s $2 trillion plan would require just two of those days that the Fed plans to print such a staggering amount of money.**

Two days.

Two days and every American can rest assured that they will be able to survive the first, and perhaps most uncertain, month of this crisis.

With Washington in the grip of an inflexible Trump administration, however, it is unlikely that policymakers will be willing to immediately side with the American people.

**In order to place pressure upon Democratic Party officials who are not yet on board with a public bailout, the Sanders campaign should redirect its phone banking and text banking efforts towards raising awareness about policies that can help deliver us from economic catastrophe — starting with Sanders’ proposed $2 trillion relief package.**

His supporters are more than willing to spend time calling or texting registered Democrats to ask them to contact their elected representatives and demand that they start taking action now. Those efforts should begin as soon as possible.

**Every moment we wait makes the situation worse.**"

I don't know if anyone posted this but this is really important. There are two sides of this:

1. There can be shortage of masks for health workers if everyone tries to get masks (which is currently happening)
2. Wearing a mask could actually slow the spread of the virus from your nose, mouth but it would work if everyone wears it. It is proven that asymptomatic people are spreading also and even you can spread through breathing.

They used crystal electron microscopy I believe and they discovered structures humans haven't seen before. They can see how the virus exists in Civets and Bats and it doesn't resemble ones in Civets so if it passed via Civets it was a swift transmission without mutation. My personal feeling is this is a natural evolution of a virus and humans some have the capability to modify a virus to be this precise in its infection mechanism. 

Interesting take. A lab certainly could have used natural evolution in their process. So it could be ""natural"" in that we may not have purposely inserted a gene to create that specific spike protein, but we could have been cross-breeding viruses that led to the mutation. We would never be able to prove that, though. They could have used CRISPR to insert a gene that expressed the spike protein they wanted. SARS-CoV-2's spike gene shares a 39-base insertion with a type of soldierfish that swims in the South China Sea. It could have jumped naturally, sure. However, the genomes from many different samples of SARS-CoV-2 are very uniform. So if the jump did happen naturally, it was a fluke single jump, not the usual back and forth that would lead to more genetic diversity in samples. If it had been multiple introductions from different animals, you would see more genetic diversity between samples. I think the uniformity in the genome is a little suspect. I could see a researcher finding a spike gene in a soldierfish that seemed promising, then using a tool like CRISPR to insert that gene, or a modified version of it, into a coroanavirus from a bat that existed naturally. I would not say that is too complex for a human. We may not have come up with the sequence ourselves. We may have turned to another animal in nature to discover it, then connected the dots. Again, I am just speculating off the data we currently have. I am sure more info will come out over time that will point in one or the other direction. I just know it is too early to say for certain this was 100% of natural origin.

>Anyway we wanted a fix for Global warming and this virus has massively reduced CO2 emissions. The unintended consequence of getting what you wish for. 

Yeah, that is kind of a silver lining. Maybe we can learn some things from this; not just about our risks for pandemics, but how we are affecting the Earth.

>Was this human made with a human agenda? I haven't seen data to say that's true, and quite the contrary.

>Was this designed by nature to show us whose boss and retaliate to our destruction of the ecosystem of this planet? That's a real difficult one to give evidence of intent.

>I go with the simplest option which is this is a natural phenomenon and not something we weren't expecting but it's still mind blowing and surreal that it's happening to us all.

Again, not to go too into conspiracy territory, but China went nuts trying to cover this up. They still are. They are trying to cover this shit up WAAAAAY more than SARS back in 2002. If this was totally natural, why is China doing what they are? Why are they preventing WHO and CDC scientists from coming to China to help study its origins?

https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/07/health/cdc-coronavirus-china.html

Why are they trying so hard to stop anyone talking about where the virus came from, and even starting a conspiracy of their own that the US Army was the one that started it?

These are not normal things for a country to do when fighting a totally 100% natural virus that just happened to jump species and spread.  Again, I am not an epidemiologist. I am just an observer. However, I like to think I understand human responses pretty well. The response to this thing from China has been very different than the past, and I personally would like an explanation for why. Downplaying the outbreak, stifling scientific talk about it, and jailing doctor's and journalists trying to warn us about it has made this situation much much worse than it could have been. Those actions have directly resulted in many more deaths, and I really hope we hold people accountable for that. Natural origin or not, their actions led to the mess we are in now. If we just let that blow over, we will invite it to happen again in the future."

Bankers are having to tell America’s biggest, most credit-worthy companies that they’ll need to wait, pay more, or in extreme cases look elsewhere for new loans to bolster their cash buffers.

For many on Wall Street, such a situation would’ve seemed almost unimaginable just a few weeks ago. But with blue-chip corporations tapping existing revolvers at a dizzying clip, alternative funding sources freezing up and capital-markets desks stretched to the limit operationally, banks are suddenly being forced to have some tough conversations.

Lenders are basing decisions on a variety of factors, including their strategic relationship with the borrower, how urgently the company needs the cash, their credit quality and how much more they’re willing to pay, according to high-level bankers who asked not to be identified discussing private transactions.

“It’s precautionary for companies to ask for more liquidity, but prudent,” said Bradley Rogoff, a credit strategist at Barclays Plc. “There is a probability in two months that some of these companies won’t be able to reopen stores or will have sales at some small fraction of what they normally are.”

Banks are continuing to fund revolving credit facilities as requests from companies such as Ford Motor Co. and J.C. Penney Co. to draw them flood in. Revolvers are committed financing, which means that lenders are legally required to provide the cash if they’re asked.
But as companies tap their existing revolving credit facilities, they’re also asking for additional funds in the form of new revolvers and term loans to further bolster liquidity. Banks are under no such legal obligation to provide these.

Safety Net

Many of these investment-grade borrowers haven’t yet been directly impacted by the coronavirus outbreak, but want the cash on hand in case credit conditions or the global economy deteriorate further. That’s in contrast to a number of mostly-junk rated companies in industries such as travel, gaming and leisure that have tapped revolvers because of plummeting revenues.

An industry group for the banks has repeatedly expressed confidence in their liquidity in recent days. Still, while Moody’s Investors Service said in a report Wednesday that capital levels at the biggest global lenders were sufficient to cope with accelerating cash demands from corporations, they also noted that banks must remain vigilant.
“This does not mean that liquidity cannot be pressured at banks when debt markets are freezing up and recession risk is rising in some of the largest economies,” analysts led by Olivier Panis wrote.
Read more: How cash-hungry firms could bite $700 billion out of banks
The surging demand for bank financing is also being driven by spiking rates in the market for commercial-paper, a type of short-term financing that companies use to make payroll or purchase inventory.
The turmoil in the vital cog of the financial system’s plumbing prompted the Federal Reserve to intervene on Tuesday. If the market calms, companies may go ahead and repay their revolvers and stop seeking out the new loans, market watchers say.

But that will take at least a few more days to unfold, and corporate treasurers might still want to keep the extra cash on hand out of concern funding markets could seize up again.
Read more: Traders look to Fed for answers amid commercial-paper chaos
Some companies that are intent on drawing new loans are having to pay up to access the cash, the people familiar said.

Bankers said that the so-called drawn pricing -- the cost of actually tapping a new loan commitment, rather than just having access to the facility -- is going up, reflecting the riskier macro backdrop.
Investment-grade loan rates are typically very stable. But the past week saw the biggest jump since the financial crisis, one banker said.
“We’ve only really seen a similar use of revolvers and new facilities in the 2008-2009 time period,” said Rogoff, the Barclays credit strategist. “Based on how quickly some of the companies are doing this so far, we think it will likely wind up being a greater amount than we saw then.”"

>Big media giants are becoming increasingly intertwined with big government agencies that they are supposed to be holding to account. In their book titled, The New Digital Age: Reshaping the Future of People, Nations and Business, Eric Schmidt and fellow Google executive Jared Cohen wrote, “What Lockheed Martin was to the twentieth century…technology and cyber-security companies [like Google] will be to the twenty-first.” Last year, Facebook announced that it was partnering with NATO think tank, the Atlantic Council, in order to help weed out fake news on its site. The Council’s board is a whos-who of high state officials, including Henry Kissinger, Colin Powell, Condoleezza Rice and multiple former CIA chiefs, including Michael Hayden, Leon Panetta, and Michael Morell. After working with the council, Facebook immediately began banning and removing accounts linked to media in official enemy states like Iran, Russia, and Venezuela and began silencing critics of Western governments.

>39 percent of Americans get their news from Facebook, 20 percent from YouTube and 15 percent from Twitter, according to the 2019 Reuters Institute Digital News Report. Furthermore, similar numbers of people in other countries rely on those platforms to understand world events; effectively meaning the U.S. government is increasingly in control of what the planet sees online. A case in point is Iran in January, when, at the behest of the Trump administration, Instagram banned all messages of support for General Qassem Soleimani, who had been killed in a U.S. drone strike. “We operate under U.S. sanctions laws, including those related to the U.S. government’s designation of the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) and its leadership,” a tech spokesperson said. Instagram has over 24 million Iranian users. A University of Maryland poll found over 80 percent of Iranians held a positive view of the general, meaning that Trump, through Silicon Valley monopolies over online communication, could effectively censor a majority opinion from being spoken by Iranians, to Iranians."

Americans dislike socialism as a knee-jerk reaction, they don't even have to understand it or know anything about it really to hate it. To them it's like Nazis. 

But anyway, it's, if you look at it historically its really about the material conditions of the working class. Those in power, those profiting from the status quo, have to maintain that line like where people can get food and unemployment is pretty low. Once it drops below that line, that's when it kicks off.

Of course it is possible the contagion was already higher in Lombardia when testing started but the early massive testing in Veneto helped avoid the extreme spread of contagion that hit Lombardia in the past weeks. 

Now Veneto wants to perform massive testing on all citizens and other Regions are considering to follow the same route:

Men are faring worse than women in the coronavirus pandemic, according to statistics emerging from across the world.

On Friday, White House COVID-19 Task Force director Dr. Deborah Birx cited a report from Italy showing that men in nearly every age bracket were dying at higher rates than women. Birx called it a “concerning trend.”

The apparent gender gap in Italy echoes earlier statistics from other hard-hit countries. While preliminary, early accounts have suggested that boys and men are more likely to become seriously ill than are girls and women, and that men are more likely to die.

Italian health authorities last week reported that among 13,882 cases of COVID-19 and 803 deaths between Feb. 21 and Mar. 12, men accounted for 58% of all cases and 72% of deaths. Hospitalized men with COVID-19 were 75% more likely to die than were women hospitalized with the respiratory disease.

Those figures are in line with early accounts from China, where the novel coronavirus first appeared, and from South Korea, where detection and tracking of coronavirus infections have been very comprehensive.

An analysis of all COVID-19 patient profile studies filed in China from December 2019 to February 2020 suggests that men account for roughly 60% of those who are infected and become sick. And in a detailed accounting of 44,600 cases in mainland China as of Feb. 11, China’s Center for Disease Control reported that the fatality rate among men with confirmed coronavirus infections was roughly 65% higher than it was among women.

Even among children younger than 16, coronavirus may affect boys more than girls. In a recent report on 171 children and adolescents who were treated for COVID-19 at the Wuhan Children’s Hospital, 61% were male.

In South Korea, men accounted for nearly 62% of all cases. And infected men were 89% more likely to die than were women.

The emerging picture of male vulnerability to coronavirus may be easily explained by a clear gender disparity with social and cultural roots: Across the world, men are much more likely to smoke cigarettes. That damages their lungs and primes them for inflammation and further damage when they are battling an infection.

In China, where cigarette smoking rates are among the highest in the world, 54% of men were current smokers in 2010, and 8.4% were ex-smokers. Yet only 3.4% of Chinese women had ever smoked, according to the same 2016 study.

In South Korea, the disparity was almost as pronounced: half of adult men and 4% of women smoke. In Italy, 28% of adult males and 20% of females smoke.

But that’s not the whole story, said Dr. Stanley Perlman, a pediatric infectious disease specialist at the University of Iowa who has studied coronavirus infection in mice.

In a series of experiments in 2016 and 2017, a team led by Perlman infected male and female mice with the coronaviruses that caused severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS). At every age, male mice were more susceptible to infection than females.

At the same time, the death rates of infected female mice shot up when their ovaries were removed, or when they got drugs that suppressed the activity of the hormone estrogen.

To Perlman, those dual findings strongly suggest that there’s something about estrogen that protects against the ravages of deadly coronaviruses — and he suspects it’s true for the new SARS-CoV-19 virus as well.

“Why does estrogen protect the woman, and how?” Perlman said. “We’d like to know.” Estrogen has so many important roles in the female body, “it’s hard to prove anything” about its specific protective powers, he said.

For most other lung diseases, men have a distinct advantage. Women have long been known to suffer complications and die of influenza at higher rates than men. They’re much more likely to develop autoimmune diseases of the lungs. And after accounting for men’s higher rates of smoking, women appear to be more vulnerable than men to lung cancer and emphysema.

“We don’t really understand why that is,” said UC Davis’s Kent E. Pinkerton, who studies gender differences in lung health.

But Pinkerton and others suggest that humans’ responses to COVID-19 could reveal important distinctions between the way that men’s and women’s immune systems fight infection. They suspect that hormonal differences may be playing a key role in that immune response.

And if scientists can uncover how that works, they could identify better strategies for fighting coronavirus infections in general, they said.

Researchers will scour the records of COVID-19 cases for evidence that the immune system’s perimeter defenses — the body’s first response to infection — may react more robustly to this coronavirus in women than in men, said Susan Kovats, an immunologist at the Oklahoma Medical Research Foundation in Oklahoma City.

If that “innate” immune response tends to be stronger in females, infected women may have more luck keeping their viral loads low, Kovats said. And they may not need to roll out an army of the immune system’s big guns — the T-cells and B-cells — for a major battle.

Often, mounting such an assault after viral loads have shot up does double damage, she said. The infection itself damages delicate lung tissue. And then, the “adaptive” immune system overreacts, setting off dangerous levels of inflammation that cause further damage in the lungs.

The result can be death. But if women are thwarting infection earlier and more effectively, they might be less likely to suffer that outcome, Kovats said.

“I’m not surprised” that women’s immune systems may do things in ways that men could learn from, Pinkerton said. For years, immunologists only studied male mammals because the complexity of female hormones muddied their findings, he said.

Once the trails look promising in treating a certain disease they basically give it a seal of approval. I’m assuming they’re watching many different treatment plans right now, waiting for enough data to be compiled before giving it a approval to work on the Coronavirus.

A USA TODAY analysis out last week showed if the nation sees a major spike in COVID-19 patients, there could be almost six seriously ill patients for every existing hospital bed. 

Vice President Mike Pence, who heads the White House's Coronavirus Task Force, asked hospitals last week to stop doing elective surgeries and reiterated the call Wednesday at a White House news conference. The same day, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services issued ""voluntary recommendations"" for elective surgeries to encourage cancellation of non-essential procedures until the COVID-19 outbreak is past.

""We're asking every American, and our medical community leaders, and hospitals to partner with us in delaying elective procedures across the country and our healthcare system to ensure that medical supplies and medical capacity go where they're needed,"" said Pence. 

In addition to those concerns, Alvarez noted the procedures create yet another patient who is at higher risk for contracting COVID-19 because having surgery suppresses the immune system. (People with chronic health conditions and those older than 60 also are at higher risk of contracting the illness with serious symptoms.)

Surgeon General Dr. Jerome Adams and the American College of Surgeons also have asked hospitals to stop elective procedures. Adams' office issued a statement to USA TODAY saying its request was ""in sync with current CDC recommendations for healthcare facilities."""

You may have seen some study I haven't, but best guess is you're taking 1/500 from estimates like [this one](https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/coronavirus-age-sex-demographics/). While .2% is indeed 1/500, to be clear that's 1/500 for the whole age group, not just healthy individuals. Meaning young people with comorbidities will have higher than 1/500 risk, while those without will have lower.

Note also that the .2% came from very early estimates of fatalities in reported cases, where reported cases are often more severe on average (thus more likely to be detected). The true fatality rate of this virus will likely not be known until after the peak of the disease has passed, but [more recent studies](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/media/imperial-college/medicine/sph/ide/gida-fellowships/Imperial-College-COVID19-NPI-modelling-16-03-2020.pdf) that take under-reporting into account estimate even lower fatality rates, less than 1/3000 for people under 30 and 1/1000 for people under 40, and again, would be even lower for people without preexisting conditions.

I don't want to minimize the impact here-- this virus is still far more deadly than other diseases like the flu in young people, and it's imperative young people take is seriously for the sake of everyone in society. But it isn't helpful to throw around numbers that aren't backed up with evidence."

1 in 7 will get it.   That's over a million New Jerseyans

\> With only moderate social distancing efforts, the number swells to 1.3 million, and New Jersey could see more than 250,000 people infected at the same time at the peak of the crisis, which is projected to come in May in that scenario. 

so we have at least two months of this 

&#x200B;

\> Worldwide, most countries are experiencing a death rate between 1% and 3%. As of Friday, 11 of the 890 people known to be infected in New Jersey have died — a death rate of 1.2%. Even at a 1% rate, anywhere from 7,000 to 13,000 New Jerseyans could die from the virus, the data suggests. 

&#x200B;

13,000.  just in Jersey.  

&#x200B;

\> For comparison, 750 New Jerseyans were killed during 9/11, and the state lost about 40 people because of Hurricane Sandy. 

&#x200B;

\> Stephanie Silvera, an epidemiologist at Montclair State University, realizes the prospect of isolation into the fall is frightening. 

&#x200B;

THE FALL??? 

&#x200B;

\> The danger of the virus is for the 15% to 20% who do wind up showing symptoms, the large number of them — between 40% and 55% — will need to be hospitalized, the study found. 

&#x200B;

\> The numbers indicated, depending on the speed of the spread, that at the peak of the shortfall, there will be between 4.5 and 13 New Jerseyans who need a hospital bed for every 1 that is available.

Those people have a higher chance of recovery, but their presence in hospitals reduces room for those more at risk.  Which pushes the morbidity rate higher overall and especially for people in the 60+ demographic.  So they're putting themselves in danger and by extension drastically raising the danger for others.

Spanish Flu is called such because Spain was one of the neutral countries in WWI that was able to report on the virus without affecting moral due to the war. Zika is named after a forest. And the Spanish Inquisition was a religious persecution that occurred in Spain (don’t know why that’s on the list)

Calling Coronavirus the “chinese virus” is wrong because 1) it already has a proper name and 2) Chinese and other Asian people are literally being targeted and harassed because of people thinking they are related to the virus.

I am also ‘recovering’ from lots of addictions but the two biggest blights on my life have been alcohol and gambling.  Alcohol addiction peaked in my mid 20s and I would say the gambling hung round until my early 40s.  I’m not 100% clean from either.  I drink very rarely, a couple of times per year (if that).  I also excluded myself from bookmakers and online betting.  Now and again I’ll have a little relapse if I’m away with work and they don’t know me in the area.  I’ll have a bet and I usually lose, feel bad and then forget about it.  Which leads me onto my point...

With the Coronavirus I’ve been at home more than usual.  For the last week I’ve limited myself to $10 per day on dice games.  I won every day and I was thinking how easy it’s been.  I was probably up about $200 until Friday.  On Friday, I deposited $10, lost.  Instead of sticking to my promise, I did another $10 and lost.  Might as well go for it:  $30,$50,$100,$200 all losses.  To cut a long story short I went into a ‘brown’ out which lead to me uncontrollably trying to login to my investment wallet (something I’ve been working on for years) to move money.  I couldn’t easily login which bought me time to snap out of it.  However, I am convinced that if I was successful then I’d be sat here now with no stack.  Unless you are a very controlled and measured person then these sites are EXTREMELY dangerous.  Please if you are thinking about using them then don’t.  I’ve done a lot of gambling in my life and if I could equate this one to a drug then it would be crack cocaine.  Unlike traditional bookies there is no way to ‘exclude’ yourself and once your hooked that’s it - your fucked and there’s only one outcome.  Very, very insidious places."

Alright everybody I've been preaching about the nonspecific effects of vaccines for years now. I'll do a quick review of the flu shot thing so far:

We already knew that the inactivated flu shot caused a 5x increase of upper respiratory illness after flu shot. Not specifically coronavirus though. https://academic.oup.com/cid/article/54/12/1778/455098

Compared to the unvaccinated, the flu shot causes 6× increased viral aerosol generation (breathing it out more) in those that caught the flu anyway. http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2018/01/17/1716561115

But why?

Basically your immune system is like oh shit I need to make antibodies to this shot! and it forgets about its cellular immunity at the lung interface. 

Here's a great ted talk by a vaccine scientist explaining how killed vaccines screw up your immune system. https://youtu.be/_d8PNlXHJ48

Okay that ^ was the review. HERE'S WHAT'S NEW:

This 2020 study done with the US Department of Defense:

""Receiving influenza vaccination may increase the risk of other respiratory viruses, a phenomenon known as virus interference.""

""Vaccine derived virus interference was significantly associated with coronavirus and human metapneumovirus"".

You linked sciencedaily which is a science journalism site. Second if you read the actual paper this is their argument:    
  

"" It is improbable that SARS-CoV-2 emerged through laboratory manipulation  of a related SARS-CoV-like coronavirus. As noted above, the RBD of  SARS-CoV-2 is optimized for binding to human ACE2 with an efficient  solution different from those previously predicted[7](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0820-9#ref-CR7),[11](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0820-9#ref-CR11).  Furthermore, if genetic manipulation had been performed, one of the  several reverse-genetic systems available for betacoronaviruses would  probably have been used[19](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0820-9#ref-CR19). However, the genetic data irrefutably show that SARS-CoV-2 is not derived from any previously used virus backbone[20](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0820-9#ref-CR20).  Instead, we propose two scenarios that can plausibly explain the origin  of SARS-CoV-2: (i) natural selection in an animal host before zoonotic  transfer; and (ii) natural selection in humans following zoonotic  transfer. We also discuss whether selection during passage could have  given rise to SARS-CoV-2. ""    

They claim it couldn't hvae been human made because they didn't see a regularly used plasmid method used to insert the ACE receptors. Not proof of anything.  This is the paper they cite to argue that claim. I remain skeptical.

Another person commented that s/he took their mother, who was having GI and respiratory symptoms, from an assisted living facility to the emergency department. They were there for 12 hours and they sent her back to that facility without testing her. So she may be positive, is probably exposing all of the people in that assisted living facility, as well as hospital staff and her family.

""Yeah, this drug can work against coronavirus, but have you thought you can overdose and die?"".

For fucks sake, the tablet of hydroxychlorquine is 200 mg. You have to take 10 at once to get some side effects. Does it have side effects on lower concentrations? Literally every single drug in existance has side effects. Some are common, some are rare. This drug has been known for a long time and side effects are rare, so it is considered safe.

There are other drugs that have a dose of a few miligrams (like enalapril comes in 10mg), and others like come in grams, like paracetamol (500mg or 1 gram tablets available). That article really ticked me off because it is the most idiotic alarmism that makes no sense at all, because all drugs work at different concentrations and everything has a lethal dose. You can overdose on rabbit meat (protein poisoning) and on fucking water. If you take 2 grams of enalapril, you can fucking die. If you take 2 grams of paracetamol, nothing happens.

I don't particularly like Trump, but sticking it to him in the most idiotic ways just makes me hate journalists even more."

In a brutally blunt piece for the New York Times, columnist Jennifer Senior went scorched earth on Donald Trump for his lie-filled performances in the now daily press briefings on the coronavirus pandemic — suggesting the media call them what they are: presidential “propaganda.”

Following a day when the combative Trump attacked NBC reporter Peter Alexander for merely asking what he could say to the public that is living in fear of the pandemic, Senior said enough is enough.
			 			
“In a time of global emergency, we need calm, directness and, above all, hard facts. Only the opposite is on offer from the Trump White House. It is therefore time to call the president’s news conferences for what they are: propaganda,” she wrote. 

“We may as well be watching newsreels approved by the Soviet Politburo. We’re witnessing the falsification of history in real time. 

When Donald Trump, under the guise of social distancing, told the White House press corps on Thursday that he ought to get rid of 75 to 80 percent of them — reserving the privilege only for those he liked — it may have been chilling, but it wasn’t surprising. 

He wants to thin out their ranks until there’s only Pravda in the room.”

According to the columnist, Trump’s press conferences are full of bluster and lies and stand in stark contrast with those being held by Gov. Andrew Cuomo (D-NY).

For many, Friday’s contentious press conference should be the tipping point for most journalists.

“At his Thursday news conference, a discussion of chloroquine and other experimental therapies formed the core of his remarks, when those drugs and therapies are untested and unproven and, in some cases, won’t be ready for several months, as NBC’s Peter Alexander pointed out the following day,” she recalled. 

“‘What do you say to Americans who are scared?’ Alexander pressed. ‘I say that you’re a terrible reporter,’ Trump answered. 

Only a liar — and a weak man with delusions of competence — would be so unnerved by the facts.”

“Most dangerous of all is Trump’s insistence that things are fine, or will be shortly, that they’ll be stronger and better and greater than ever. 

We don’t have any evidence that this is true, and the president finds any suggestion to the contrary quite rude. When a journalist pointed out to him on Thursday that the economy had all but ground to halt, Trump cut him off,” she explained. 

“Here’s the truth: Things might be hard — unfathomably hard — for months, perhaps even north of a year. Anyone who’s reading or listening to other sources of news besides the president knows that. It takes sensitivity and strength and intelligence to speak truthfully to the public about imminent hardship, the prospect of enduring pain.”

Then came the Cuomo comparison.

“I listen to Cuomo, who says the same thing. His news conference on Friday was about the practical things, knowing the entire state — country, globe — had just taken a precipitous slide down Maslow’s hierarchy of needs, with food, shelter and safety now topmost on many people’s minds. No one can evict you for 90 days. We’re getting hospital beds. We’re recruiting doctors and nurses in training to fight this fight, and we’re coaxing medical professionals out of retirement,” she wrote. 

“Then he spoke from the heart. One of his daughters was in quarantine. ‘To tell you the truth, I had some of the best conversations with her that I’ve ever had,’ Cuomo said. She was alone for two weeks. ‘We talked about things in depth that we didn’t have time to talk about in the past,’ he continued, ‘or we didn’t have the courage or the strength to talk about in the past — feelings I had, about mistakes I had made along the way that I wanted to express my regret and talk through with her.'”

“He was expressing fallibility. Imagine that,” she concluded."

Trump fired the pandemic response team, let the CDC strangle the COVID testing with red tape, and is leading us into a recession with 0 percent interest rates and huge reserves of stimulus injected for the past few years for absolutely no reason. Obama handled every situation with urgency, tact, and bipartisanship. Trump has led us into a crisis with the worst possible scenarios all at once. 

I work in a reference lab that does COVID testing. The situation from the get-go has been a nightmare. Two days ago we had an entire pallet sized dry ice cooler full of coronavirus specimens that were untested, from clients around the country, being sent to another lab because we could not handle any more than the cases in our state of 3 million citizens. We have been strangled by red tape and stuck with the CDC’s PCR test instead of the WHO kit that has reagent available for the capacity of testing needed. There is a faster way to be doing this. If Trump had implemented emergency measures from the day that he insisted it would go away, we would actually be flattening the curve right now. Instead we are heading towards May-June peaks in most states with exponential growth. 

This is a pandemic of holocaust proportions. When this is all said and done years from now, Trump’s mismanagement and complete ineptitude of our country in comparison to other similar wealthy western democracies will be directly linked to hundreds of thousands of preventable deaths. That is why that matters. Any leader would have leveraged the strength of the American people into a war-like battle against this virus and united us with the world in a common struggle to contain the virus. Instead Trump has left us unprepared and in complete disarray with both the rest of the world and within our own governments. There is no coordination. This is a task that needs to be managed from a global level."

Coronavirus/Covid-19 has absolutely nothing to do with fitness or exercise. 

If you are looking for alternate workout routines, [the Recommended Routines page](https://thefitness.wiki/routines/) and Google are digital entities and cannot contract Coronavirus, and are therefore just as available for you to use to answer that question as they have always been, and break [Rule #0](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/wiki/rules/rule0) just as much as they did before you learned that Wuhan exists. Here's a set of answers to every other post:

- No, you are obviously not the only person who is afraid of it.
- No, your gym is not the only one that has closed.
- Yes, lots of people are probably not going to the gym, just like they're not going to everywhere else.
- Yes, you do the same thing to continue exercising that you would in any other situation where you can't go to a gym. 
- Yes, you take the same precautions at the gym that you would take anywhere else. 
- No, there is nothing random bozos from Reddit can tell you better than what the CDC et al are already saying. 
- No, this is not a place to find the coronavirus equivalent of Thunder Buddies.

More international partnerships will be necessary as we assess the economic wreckage that the pandemic will leave. Enlightened self-interest in working together to prevent such a crisis from happening again could well trump the knee-jerk reaction to retreat to national fortresses that are anything but secure.
> 
> Though months without familiar modes of travel may forever change patterns of behavior, judging from how people have snapped back after previous crises, that seems unlikely. Once the worst has passed, we may find waves of pent-up demand for millions of people to venture once more into the world, this time with coordinated health screening across countries akin to what emerged in the post-9/11 world to prevent the flow of people, money and goods that might support terrorist organizations.
> 
> And then there is the flow of capital. Markets in the past few weeks have crashed globally, in sync and almost simultaneously. In the U.S., as much as $10 trillion has been erased from markets. Every major market in the world saw equities lose 20% to 30%, and bonds have swung wildly and destructively.
> 
> But it isn’t just goods and people that have circled the world in ever more energetic motion over the past two decades; money has too. In the past 15 years, according to the Federal Reserve, U.S. holdings of foreign securities rose from $6 trillion to more than $12 trillion, and similar explosive growth occurred for countries around the world. That has gone hand in hand with loosening rules on capital flows. China alone, among major economic players, has meaningful capital restrictions, and only its domestic markets move out of sync with the financial markets of the rest of the world.
> 
> The absence of any real capital controls and the vastly increased appetite to invest everywhere is why financial markets began crashing once the coronavirus leapt from China. It took weeks for the disease itself to move from South Korea to Europe to the U.S., but it only took days for the financial contagion to spread. That is the pain of the moment for investors, but it is also provides a glimmer of the possible pace and scale of the global recovery when it arrives. Money can evaporate in a heartbeat and flow in an instant.
> 
> It is easy to imagine the demise of our massively interdependent world at a moment when it comes to a rapid, vertiginous halt. But a sharp contraction caused by a pandemic is not the same as a permanent reversal of the deep and complicated global integration of supply chains, markets and daily life built up over the past two decades. Those relationships are durable and beneficial and will be difficult to sever. Some are ready to try, but most of the world isn’t eager to renationalize industry, make trillions of dollars of global investment worthless and suppress the appetite for easy travel and free movement of people, goods and capital. The coronavirus is unlikely to be the moment when we see the collapse of a broad historical trend that has endured through the Great Depression, World War II, the Cold War and innumerable other crises, from 9/11 to the financial upheaval of 2007-08.
> 
> The months ahead will feel like the presumptive end of an era of globalization. And it may be the end of globalization’s first phase, with its heady optimism and corresponding ideological and economic backlash. But there will be a next phase, one less rosy-eyed and less sour as well.
> 
> As citizens emerge from various forms of sheltering in place, they will confront the days of spring with the relief and bewilderment of our predecessors in World War II emerging from a bomb shelter the morning after. They will find a changed world of travel limitations and viral testing but also a massive global system that remains structurally intact, if on the defensive philosophically. But the sheer scale of what has been created over the past several decades, to say nothing of the enormous benefits that have flowed from it for billions of people, will preclude a lasting reversal. We will discover that we are indeed all in this together.
> 
> Is it possible that we are truly at the end? Yes, but not likely. Globalization is dead. Long live globalization."

2020-03-21,Livid-Variety,ASU,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/ASU/comments/fm3ulv/students_at_university_of_arizona_will_get_some/fl31uil/,"In late January, Crow basically gaslighted students who were concerned about 60,000 people milling around on a crowded campus when ASU had the first case, saying the risks were minimal / the symptoms were mild.

Two months later, Crow effectively says ""There is a massive crisis right now \[Due to Coronavirus\] / thinking about refunds is inappropriate"".

ASU is doing a flashy Coronavirus testing drive, while basically enabling a transmission risk to students (and the phoenix area) akin to that of a cruise ship, nursing home, or prison by keeping dorms opened and not encouraging students to go home (including by offering prorated refunds, which the vast majority of public universities have already done). 

At the end of the day, ASU is a public institution, not a for-profit company that exists to effectively serve Arizona residents and ASU students, and ASU students have a right to call for transparency, accountability, and a voice in how their funds are used or not used. That includes asking that money they've paid for something that now puts their health at risk be refunded. Especially with the economic impact of Coronavirus on students and their families... At the very least, ASU students deserve accurate, full information and transparency about the numbers behind why decisions are being made / where funds are now going / and the ability to call into question those decisions. Definitely not to be -- more or less -- scolded and told to shut up and go back to the kids table. That attitude destroys critical thinking, innovation, and citizen participation. 

Otherwise, heck, look at airlines--even for-profit companies are granting refunds and waiving flight cancellation penalties. Even AMERICAN AIRLINES cares more about their customers...lol)"

I debate posting about it in a thread about Colton's diagnosis and discussion of Cassie's family's exposure being discussed because I can't imagine the anxiety they and many other family's feel and will feel over coming weeks when a family member is diagnosed and I don't want to fear monger, but this imo is the best example to explain the gravity of this pandemic and why people are being asked to drastically alter their lives and the world's economy to help prevent the spread.

I don't know the ages of the 2 on life support, but the 3 siblings were in their 50s and the mother in her 70s, but regardless of age, statistically this virus taking down that many people in ONE family is INSANE and terrifying.  When some family member's I share a living space with that are early 60s made an unneccesary trip a few hours away this weekend to take care of some personal business...I've just about lost my mind. I tried to convince them how serious this threat is and they still went, agreeing to be very cautious but still, I'm horrified by them and I think the risk is far greater than the reward.  I can't stop thinking my family could be the ones living this surreal nightmare this poor family in NJ is a few weeks from now.

In addition, if you start to feel really bad, ensure you are drinking plenty of water. 8 oz an hour is a good starting point. Monitor your temperature. Get as much rest as you can. If you really start to feel like you are having serious trouble breathing get to an ER. Chances are if you do not have underlying conditions you are just in for a bit of a bad week or two.

More information on what to do when self-isolating can be found online, including on when it is appropriate to head for the hospital. The most important thing, right now, that you can do is to relax and take a few minutes. If you've got it, nothing is going to change that. It's already done. If you don't have it, keep taking precautions to avoid getting it. Either way just try and take emotion out of the equation. You're going to be alright."

But 5-7 days felt like 3-7 sometimes. So, 2 week ago, when there was actually a moderate stock available everywhere, it got interesting. I decided to stock up because I lived in Hurricane zones for a while, and ""well, it'll be good for earthquakes at the least"".

The availability of digital copies of games depend on both the company providing the game to still be in existence and the company being willing to continue allowing access to it.  The example I used in a recent comment was an owner of a physical copy of Skyrim on Xbox 360 is guaranteed playability (to some degree, more on that later) in the future where as someone who purchased a digital copy off of Xbox Live store may one day face Microsoft delisting it, preventing future re-installations.  

That being said, physical copies aren't a total guarantee of availability.  Optical discs degrade over time for instance (search up ""disc rot""), and assuming online retailers for digital copies maintain availability, digital actually has the one up here.  Some newer games also don't do a total install from the disc and require an online download for some portions of the software, which again depends on the online provider either still existing or choosing to maintain availability.  Finally, many games from the past decade have some degree of online functionality that may one day no longer exist, such as multiplayer servers getting shut down.  In the case of the Playstation 3 game MAG, an online only multiplayer first person shooter, any extant physical copies of the game are essentially coasters now as the servers have been shut down, the game is no longer functionally accessible."

My wife is being seen by an MS specialist and it seems this doctor also works at the MS clinic and implied they'd be working together even after she is discharged. So we are thankful for that. 

Neuro has said she will probably be started on Tysabri. She said other DMTs are too risky given Coronavirus outbreak. I'm a bit worried she won't get the best treatment possible. 

I'm concerned that because her symptoms are severe at the moment and she can't use her left hand (spreading to right hand) that 
A) we don't know if she will regain mobility/strength as symptoms are just getting worse 3.5 weeks after appearing and B) if we don't go on the strongest drug like Mavenclad then there would be more chance of a further relapse and thus a further chance of a potentially life long disability.

\- another tenant lost their job and decided to stop paying the rent

\- another tenant continually complained about the neighbours/dogs/noisy kids/ etc

\- the body corporate meetings were acrimonious

\- I had to pay rates and land tax, which the local government continued to raise above the inflation rate

\- I worried about an eventual increase in interest rates, remembering 17% in 1989/90.

\- additional accounting costs and complexity of negatively gearing

\- the need to deal with real estate agents and paying commission and fees on purchase, sale and management of the property.

\- the hassle, time and cost of selling an IP

Everything is easier with share investments and as a long term investor I am not overly worried about coronavirus pandemic panics because they present buying opportunities."

But I want to address a larger point about people renting instead of owning and so forth. Much of liberal thought tends to talk about individuals making individual decisions, where I try to look at the macroeconomic picture. Because you do have a situation where there are 100 million or so people in the U.S. (guesstimate) who work necessary jobs -- see the grocery stores and Walmarts right now -- that simply do not get paid enough to own a home. Just to make ends meet, they frequently have to go into debt. If they want to go to school, they have to take on debt. To buy a car, they have to take on debt. And to buy a home, they have to take on debt. So as the consumer base of the economy has become increasingly indebted, more and more of their spending is just servicing this debt -- which is good for some (banks make money) but I think it's overall bad for the economy. But this is because labor is historically very weak and the financial side of the house is very strong.

>and renting wouldn't be so high demand if housing crises around the US weren't caused by government interventions making it effectively impossible to build new property in big cities

There have been residential building booms in many big cities. A lot of new condominiums. There are many cities where there are more empty homes being used as investment vehicles than there are homeless people. So there's something out of whack here that can't be explained simply by government restricting supply, although I don't want to dismiss that as a factor. But supply and demand doesn't entirely explain why housing is expensive. 

Now, my theory is that private developers -- even if you got rid of government -- will *never* build so much that the price of housing overall goes down. Because why would they? They are in it to make a profit, and it's not because they're bad people or greedy (although some can be) but because they *have to* make a profit to compete with the other capitalists and stay in business. Real-estate development is expensive and developers often have a fiduciary responsibility to their investors to bring a return, or they have loans to large financial institutions and must pay those loans back, and service the interest on the loan.

So the general tendency is toward building ""luxury"" properties and so forth in areas where rents and property values are expected to rise in the future. Rising rents are a signal for developers to build. They then make a profit from that future expected return. They may build so much that prices stabilize, but not go down. If they have built too much, they have made a mistake -- they have added too much oversupply -- which eventually will lead to a crash. We saw this in 2007-2008 with highly-indebted homeowners riding up a speculative bubble. Like people who deliver pizzas taking out mortgages on multiple homes or whatever.

>People are demanding the convenience of rent and entitlement over the responsibility of ownership and self-sufficiency at an alarming rate, and this tendency has dire consequences pertaining to what we value as a society, how much ownership we have over the property we do buy (Right to Repair, online services which can shut down or change policies), and the dwindling supply of property for purchase and real ownership in our future.

Well, I think the period of the middle-class ""ownership society"" that our parents grew up in is diminishing at a rapid rate, and that period was itself an anomalous period in the history of capitalism. Mass home ownership in the U.S. was subsidized by government by a variety of means for purposes of social stability and giving people a ""stake"" in their society during the Cold War and from the threat of communism. The U.S. was also in a great position to subsidize this on a large scale because of the economic boom that followed World War II. There were laws (called ""COLA contracts"") that pegged real estate contracts to inflation!

But there's no objective reason why -- from a capitalist perspective -- that most people need to own any property. It's probably way more efficient to have most people essentially placed within these layers of rent to extractive as much of their wealth as possible. Turning people from owners into renters can be profitable. As long as it's profitable, that's where the capitalists will invest their money. What difference does it make for them? They want to chase a profit and if replacing a bunch of stuff we used to do ourselves with pay-to-use digital services is more profitable, they will do that because that's ""rational"" and optimal from their perspective. And these tools may very well be more efficient at the same time, and capitalist firms do seek out efficiencies. But you see the problem -- you have a society in which pretty much everyone is proletarianized except for a relatively small class of people who own everything, just as Marx predicted."

2020-03-21,Pablissimo,politics,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/flz1al/asked_what_he_says_to_frightened_americans_trump/fl32bys/,"I do appreciate the honesty. 

I grew up in the UK, (though I've lived in the US for about 20 years), and I guess I have somewhat had it drilled into me since history lessons as a kid that there are these kind of hallmarks of authoritarian leaders throughout history (from the left or right) that are really easy to spot, like de-legitimizing the free and critical press, blaming real problems on minority scapegoat populations (and using dehumanizing rhetoric to describe them), subverting the legal system to go after political opponents in the name of ""fighting corruption"", and so on and so on.  Even installing family members and other unqualified cronies into high positions of government power.

To me it seems like Trump checked all these boxes, so the mixture of outrage and, frankly fear, coupled with mystification about how anyone could like him was absolutely real.   
I mean, since the impeachment acquittal, he's literally been joking about abolishing term limits, and making himself president for life, right?  Surely, even as a fan of his, that's got to be raising some alarm bells? I know the defense is that he's kidding, but I'm not sure what the punchline is. ""Oh, look at people getting upset by me pretending to be a dictator in waiting""? It's nuts.

I suppose it is all ""triggering"" to me for a couple of reasons. Firstly because I find it genuinely scary, and secondly because it makes me realize how naive I was to assume that we all see ourselves as basically on the same side - as Americans with just different ideas about how to achieve broadly shared goals.

I suppose I don't (or rather I didn't used to) think of myself as a partisan. My instincts are broadly liberal and I'd basically always vote Democratic, but not through some sort of self-identity, just because I generally felt that the pendulum between completely unfettered free market capitalism (which can lead to Dickensian England) and stifling regulation and self-defeating union power (which can lead to depressed 1970s England) is currently swung too far to the right, as evidenced by the massive levels of income and wealth inequality.  
But I basically felt that we're all looking for the same goals (safety, opportunity, fairness, treating people decently, a strong economy, opportunities for all etc), but just have different opinions about how to get there.  

I didn't vote for McCain, or Romney for example, and I would have disagreed strongly with their policy agenda, but I would feel like we were at least living in the same reality and they were motivated by doing their best for all of us, to the best of their ability.

But with Trump it's just crazy. As you said yourself, his talent seems to be ""making people outraged about nothing"". Whenever there's an opportunity or a need to unify the country he will take the opposite tack and do his best to drive a wedge between us.  
I mean, look at this dumb ""China Virus"" thing. People are looking for leadership in a time of national crisis. He starts using this term ""China virus"", and people suggest it may be seen as unnecessarily divisive or racist or whatever. So he responds by essentially saying ""Yeah? People don't like it? Fuck you"" and using it exclusively.  
Really, how hard would it be for him to make it a non-story by just saying ""Coronavirus, COVID-19, Chinese Virus, Wuhan flu... call it what you like, here are the steps we're taking to try to make everyone safe""?

I suppose, leaving left/right politics aside, I'm looking for a decent, empathetic and capable president. Someone who inspires people to come together for the common good and treat each other with respect. Someone you can earnestly and honestly look up to as a role model. I suppose I'm looking for old-school TNG Star Trek where we work together to forge a bright future.  
Obviously we're never going to get exactly that, but it's the ideal. Obama was close, perhaps. I have my criticisms of his presidency, but I believe he did have basic decency in spades. Frankly so did McCain. I liked Buttigieg a lot in the primary, but he unsurprisingly didn't make it.
   
I have always assumed that ultimately everyone else feels the same way, but seeing Trump win the presidency, and seeing his divisiveness cheered on has revealed how naive that is. It's pretty damn bleak, honestly.  
And I hope against hope that he doesn't win another term, and we don't have to discover whether the president-for-life ""jokes"" should have been taken more seriously, now that he seems to have complete and absolute control of the GOP."

> Researchers found that surgical face masks, made of a specialized paper that is both strong and breathable, were roughly 89 percent effective at preventing sick individuals from transmitting virus particles that are .02 microns (or micrometers) in size, which is five times smaller than the coronavirus. Meanwhile, particles 1 micron in size, 10 times larger than the coronavirus, were filtered at a rate of 97 percent.

> A vacuum cleaner bag was considered the most formidable household material with a rate of nearly 86 percent protection against the smallest particles tested. Falling behind was a standard dish towel at nearly 73 percent; a cotton-blend T-shirt at 70 percent; and an antimicrobial pillowcase at 68 percent.

> They also tested how doubling up on the material could help. In the case of dish towels, two layers showed a notable increase in filtration rate — a 14 percent jump for particles of 1 micron in size — although the same level of increased benefits could not be said for cotton shirts or pillowcases.

> Nevertheless, the Cambridge researchers still chose pillowcases and T-shirts as their favorite option in a pinch because of their breathability. While two dish towel layers may be formidable against many micro-particles, they found the construction 138 percent more difficult to breathe through than a typical surgical face mask, whereas a double-layer of pillowcases was just 4 percent less breathable.

> While medical-grade face masks were found to be, on average, “three times more effective in blocking transmission [of microorganisms]” compared to their homemade counterparts, they also concluded that makeshift masks are still better than none at all.


So I couldn't find the same description for the cotton, I think that heavy more durable material like you'd find with dish towels would be better. I wonder if one later of a more breathable cotton and one heavier duty layer on the inside for breathability would work best?"

* O risco de desabastecimento é baixo. A maior questão é evitar se expor à locais com fluxo grande de pessoas que podem ou não estar se prevenindo. Quanto antes reduzirmos ao máximo possível os contatos sociais, mais rápido a curva de contaminação perderá o caráter exponencial do movimento ^(1)
* Dito isso, faça uma compra normal para 2, 3 semanas. Não estoque papel higiênico, pq isso é só 'panic buying'^(2). Alguém comprou um monte de papel higiênico, outro alguém viu, pensou 'caraca, tô levando pouco', levou mais e começou essa bagunça. Mesma coisa com álcool em gel. Ok comprar um pouco, tudo bem, mas é desnecessário comprar 10 garrafas grandes. Sabão, detergente e desinfetantes normais também conseguem anular o vírus^(3).

On March 10, Kazakhstan’s chief doctor made a public announcement. While there were still no confirmed cases of COVID-19 in the country, he said, cases might appear over the next five days. The source of his precision was not explained, and Kazakhs were understandably skeptical. “Everyone here is joking about this,” said one Almaty resident, a Kazakh academic who asked not to be named. “People think we already have those cases but the authorities are hiding facts. Otherwise, it is ridiculous that the country with the longest border with China has no cases.


Watching from outside, experts on the region were just as incredulous. “Obviously this is impossible,” said Luca Anceschi, senior lecturer in Central Asian Studies at the University of Glasgow. Like China, he said, the tightly controlled flow of information in Central Asian states means “we’re not getting any picture. Not even the full picture—no picture at all.”
Three days later, the predictions began to be realized. Over the course of 24 hours, the Kazakhstan Health Ministry released a flurry of announcements through Facebook, confirming what were supposedly the country’s first cases: four in Almaty, the country’s largest city and the closest major metropolis to China, plus two in Nur-Sultan. All of these were citizens who had just returned from Germany, Italy, or the United States, plus one from Moscow. Supposedly, not a single transmission from China. Then, on March 15, Uzbekistan declared its first case: a medical professional who had just flown back from France.
Central Asian states are sandwiched between the outbreak hot spots of Iran and China, but on paper, COVID-19 has barely touched Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, and Turkmenistan. That might seem like a miracle. In reality, it’s cause for concern.


“As a legacy from the Soviet era, Central Asian governments are more prone to secrecy than transparency on matters of security,” said Kate Mallinson of the London think tank Chatham House. “It is unlikely that many of the governments have enough diagnosis kits. … Corruption is endemic in the health care system in the region, and vast parts of the health care budgets are stolen by officials.”
Certainly, citizens show few signs of trusting the official line. Even before the six cases were announced in Kazakhstan, Almaty’s supermarkets were mobbed, carts piled high with nonperishable food. The cost of face masks shot up to eight times the usual price. In nearby Tajikistan, President Emomali Rahmon’s personal assurances that there was no need to panic-buy food did little to slow the stockpiling that has left shelves empty.
It doesn’t help that the behavior of these leaders has been at odds with their message that all is well. Despite so few confirmed cases in Kazakhstan, the Health Ministry said its “algorithms” drove the decision to place an additional 1,500 people in quarantine, two-thirds of them in “special hospitals.” Tajikistan has asked people to avoid public gatherings and even mosques. Kyrgyzstan is canceling sporting events and closing schools and universities for three weeks. Immediately after announcing its one case, Uzbekistan imposed an international travel ban on citizens, the closure of schools and universities, and restrictions on public events.


These steps are all perfectly rational for any country bracing for an outbreak. For one insisting it has zero cases—or even, in Kazakhstan’s case, what is now over a landmass larger than all of Western Europe—it suggests either the response is overblown or the spread has been downplayed.
Not all the confusion is down to scheming, of course: Many nations simply don’t know what to do. As Eurasia expert Filippo Costa Buranelli points out, Dushanbe’s back-and-forth over travel restrictions, where bans were issued and then revoked in succession, left many people “questioning the degree of knowledge and preparation by the authorities in charge of dealing with this crisis.”
Meanwhile, in the highly secretive autocratic country of Turkmenistan, state media and government officials have denied anonymous reports that COVID-19 cases are being treated in a Choganly hospital close to Ashgabat. Authorities refuse to use the word “coronavirus” at all, even as they deploy what Mallinson of Chatham House described as the most aggressive response in the region. The central bank, she said, even canceled the cards of Turkmen citizens stranded in the Beijing airport to make it harder for them to get home. Turkmenistan has good reason to insulate itself: As Mallinson points out, its most competent doctors have moved to Turkey, and rumors abound that you can get out of quarantine by bribing officials. Its depleted health care system simply can’t handle a pandemic.
Rather than address the threat of COVID-19 directly, Ashgabat has stepped up public education initiatives about limiting the spread of infection, announcing that traditional herbal remedies can treat zoonotic diseases. That’s not terribly reassuring coming from a government whose atrocious mismanagement of medical services leads to occasional outbreaks of plague.
The world has already seen how dangerous it can be to suppress information on the spread of COVID-19. In Wuhan, China, where authorities were initially more concerned with silencing whistleblowers than containing an outbreak, tens of thousands of party members and their families came together for mass banquets as part of the annual Two Sessions events in January, creating ideal conditions for the virus to be transmitted. Meanwhile, statistical models suggest that Iran, keen to avoid panic ahead of its legislative elections in February, seriously underreported cases from the outset, claiming that the country had fewer than 100 cases at a time when the real number was probably closer to 23,000. Within days of Tehran announcing its first official case, it was already building mass graves so large they’re visible in zoomed-in satellite imagery.


Before neighboring Afghanistan had a chance to recognize the threat and close the border, COVID-19 cases were already appearing in Herat. In regions where cross-border movement is often illicit, closing down formal ports of entry may matter little: Around 3,000 people are believed to cross between Iran and Afghanistan illegally every day, and the porous border between Afghanistan and Tajikistan, a long-standing drug and human trafficking route, is extremely hard to monitor. While Turkmenistan hasn’t owned up to any cases, Mallinson points out that Iran’s delay left it “heavy exposed.”
All in all, it’s a recipe for disaster. “The combination of years of underinvestment in health care, endemic corruption, significant numbers of migrant laborers, and low public trust in governance in Central Asia makes the region extremely vulnerable to mass infection of COVID-19,” Mallinson said.
Whatever the true scale of infections in Central Asia, the economic impacts are already starting to show.
All five countries have struggled to translate a wealth of natural resources, including oil and gas, into resilient economies thanks to civil wars, instability, and ethnic tensions since gaining independence in 1991. While the poverty rate in Tajikistan and Kyrgyzstan has fallen from 70 percent in 2002 to 13 percent and 20 percent respectively, this progress is fragile. Much of it is predicated on Chinese investment in infrastructure as part of its Belt and Road Initiative, which the pandemic now threatens to bring to a halt.
Closing borders also means a sharp drop in cross-border trade. In Kazakhstan, imports from China are down 11 percent from this time last year, leading to a 12 percent reduction in customs duties from Chinese imports. And the pandemic has triggered a drop in the price of oil, Kazakhstan’s main export, which worries some Almaty residents more than the virus itself. It doesn’t help that, in January, Nur-Sultan had to reduce exports to China when dangerous chemicals were detected in an oil pipeline. The strongest economy in Central Asia is now in crisis mode.

For its less affluent neighbors, the outlook is even worse. Exporting natural gas to China accounts for 25 percent of Turkmenistan’s gross domestic product, but Beijing has significantly cut imports amid reduced demand—another casualty of COVID-19. “Even in the absence of officially reported cases, the coronavirus pandemic is already having major economic consequences for Turkmenistan,” warns Mallinson.
Autocratic Central Asian governments are used to being able to control the narrative in their respective countries, but COVID-19 isn’t something that can be contained by a party line. Now that they’re acknowledging confirmed cases, the secret is out—and the prognosis for this precarious region does not look good."

Roughly 60.8 million cases of swine flu in US, and 12,469 deaths from swine flu in the US.  That's a death rate of 0.0041%, within that 2009-2010 timeframe.

If the death rate of coronavirus is even as small as 1% (which that would be overly optimistic, as the closed case death rate is currently sitting at 11% as of the writing of this)...  That would mean if the same 60.8 million people were infected with coronavirus, 608,000 would die.  

Are 12,469 and 608,000 the same number?  No...  No, they are certainly fucking not the same number.

""The law creating the Virginia Alcoholic Beverage Control Authority deems  the exercise of our powers and duties as the performance of an essential governmental function and a matter of public necessity. Our  operation impacts citizens throughout the commonwealth and many  businesses in the hospitality industry. This status means as long as it  is safe for our employees and customers, we are to remain open in some  fashion.""

\---------------------

**A message to our Customers and Industry Partners**,

As the COVID-19 outbreak continues in Virginia and across the nation,  the health and safety of our extended community continues to be our top  priority. We’ve seen more than 28,000 views of our webpage addressing  this virus, and we will continue to share regular business updates here.  Our Media Room page also has links to our current news releases we  issued.

I’ve been meeting daily with ABC executive leaders, directors and other  key managers to stay on top of this fast-changing issue. Across the  commonwealth, ABC employees continue to show up to work to keep our  business in operation. Because of this dedication, our warehouse is  functioning and our stores remain open.

Many of you are likely aware of the coronavirus outbreak and two  subsequent deaths in the Peninsula Health District. Beginning March 20,  we will reduce business hours of 24 stores in this area in an effort to  limit the possibility of community spread of the virus. This includes  stores located in the cities of Hampton, Newport News, Poquoson and  Williamsburg, and the counties of James City and York. We limited public  access to our Hampton Regional Enforcement Office until further notice  effective March 16.

Starting Friday, these peninsula area stores will be open from noon  until 7 p.m., seven days a week, until further notice. Our Retail  Division will increase staffing at these stores to offset those  employees whose hours may be affected and to ensure stores are prepared  to assist customers and licensed businesses during these limited  hours. We will evaluate adjusting business hours at other stores should  this become necessary.

The law creating the Virginia Alcoholic Beverage Control Authority deems  the exercise of our powers and duties as the performance of an  essential governmental function and a matter of public necessity. Our  operation impacts citizens throughout the commonwealth and many  businesses in the hospitality industry. This status means as long as it  is safe for our employees and customers, we are to remain open in some  fashion. 

Our in-store tasting events and on-site RSVP and MART trainings remain  cancelled until further notice. Scheduled informal conferences for  licensees with violations continue to take place as scheduled via  teleconference, but hearings will be postponed. All application hearings  that are currently scheduled will occur.

We continue to update our website with current information on modified  regulations we’ve enacted as a result of COVID-19. The temporary changes  we’ve made to our existing regulations ease delivery criteria, among  other things, for manufacturers, wholesalers, distilleries and others.   We continue to issue licenses. Individuals and businesses applying for  banquet licenses are strongly encouraged to complete the application  online to expedite timely processing.

To date, no one at Virginia ABC has been diagnosed with COVID-19, but  the coronavirus is impacting all of us. We know we’re in for a marathon,  and according to what we’re learning on a state and national level,  things will probably get worse before they get better.

We ask that our licensees and customers aid in following Governor  Northam’s recommendation to avoid gatherings of more than 10 people and  limit visits to ABC stores. Customers can reduce time spent in stores by  shopping online at [www.abc.virginia.gov](https://virginia.us10.list-manage.com/track/click?u=6d826c5fb646b5688a5bc8a8c&id=f89ff191fc&e=ddd3d55881). After placing an order, customers can pick up their purchases at their selected store.

We are depending on everyone to get through this crisis together.  Practice social distancing. Self-quarantine if you’re 65 years of age  and older and keep gatherings to 10 or fewer people to limit the  possible exposure to the virus.  
 

Be healthy,

📷                                           Travis Hill, CEO"

On top of this, they project another 1 million dying from lack of medical equipment at our current capacity.  IE, 1 million more will die from not having ventilators. ON TOP of this, there will be about 2 million more dying from a lack of care for non-coromavirus maladies because hospitals will be dealing with overwhelming coronavirus hospitalizations. ON TOP of this, there will be at best millions of cases of chronic pulmonary disease, because severe cases cause significant damage to lungs. These are the numbers the adminstration believes to be true given what we know about the nature of the disease. And these numbers are assuming our healthcare system doesn't collapse under the weight in the process.  If it does, those millions dead will turn into untold numbers as tens, if not hundreds, of millions of people are now without any form of healthcare options for any ailment.

The number may seem low now, but remember that this is happening even with the most extreme protocols in place ever to suppress infections, and this is only the start. In Italy, the healthcare system is collapsing under the weight, something that has never happened even in the worst flu seasons. And contrary to popular belief, most people haven't caught it in Italy yet. This is happening even with doing everything in their power to keep infections from rising, something we don't do with the flu.

The economic cost of not doing anything is beyond imagining. The chaos it would sow would be beyond belief.  

So, why should I believe random internet sleuths with only a fraction of the information available to the decision makers, when literally every country in the world is imposing some of the most dramatic restrictions ever seen?  Do you honestly, in full sincerity, believe that every country in the world is gripped by media hysteria, and that they are all reacting to this being ""just a bad flu""?  Do you sincerely believe that China quarantined tens of millions of people and restricted the movement of a billion people because they were concerned over a bad flu strain?"

The estimates are currently [5% hospitalisation, 2% ICU and 1% requiring ventilators](https://www.statnews.com/2020/03/16/coronavirus-model-shows-hospitals-what-to-expect/). Let's look at that last number. Currently we'll need ~10 ventilators with each being needed for 2 weeks per patient.

At 25% growth rate the cases (and hence ventilators required) are doubling every 2 days. By next weekend we will need 20 ventilators. By 4th April it's ~40. By 15th April it's ~400. By the end of April, if the growth rates hold, it's over 13,000.

If the current growth rates hold, that's at least 9,000 dead by the end of April due to lack of available treatment. And that's not taking into account the ones that will die even with treatment.

May is probably going to be worse. Exponentially worse.

If we choose to lockdown now, Italy's lockdown seems to have reduced the growth rate to ~15% per day. If we do it now, there's a two week lag for the impact on growth rates, meaning we might still have enough ICU beds & ventilators at the end of April. We probably won't during May, though."

Court clerks at a Southwest suburban courthouse walked off the job Friday, the culmination of a week of complaints about whether their boss, Cook County Circuit Court Clerk Dorothy Brown, was doing enough to protect them and the public from the COVID-19 pandemic.

Brown’s spokeswoman confirmed the walkout at the Markham courthouse and said clerks from the nearby Bridgeview courthouse were brought in to shore up court operations. The number of clerks who left the courthouse was not known.

The union that represents the clerks, Teamsters Local 700, did not respond Friday to messages seeking comment.

The walkout came the day after the Cook County state’s attorney’s office said one of its employees had significant contact with someone suspected of having the coronavirus. That state’s attorney employee was in the Markham courthouse on Monday, according to an email obtained by the Tribune.

Tommy Brewer, the presiding judge of the Markham courthouse, acknowledged there was “a situation” at the southwest suburban courthouse and declined to comment. He referred questions to the court’s spokesman, Pat Milhizer. Milhizer did not immediately respond.

Brown on Friday also announced a major shift in how she will staff courthouses, ordering senior management to handle on-the-ground operations in a “skeleton crew” and permitting many other employees to work from home, according to a statement from spokeswoman Jalyne Strong-Shaw.

Strong-Shaw said Brown plans to ask Chief Judge Timothy Evans, who presides over the sprawling court system, to close all county courthouses. Such a drastic measure is unlikely to occur.

Brown has taken fire from the clerks’ union all week over how she has handled courtroom staff during the global pandemic.

Clerks at the Leighton Criminal Court Building, the county’s busiest, have complained for days that they were required to come to court despite a slowdown in operations. They also said they were not given proper materials to help prevent the spread of the coronavirus, such as hand sanitizer.

Ramon D. Williams, the president of Local 700, said in a statement Tuesday that Brown had put the public and employees at risk, calling out her “extreme lack of leadership.”

“She states that there aren’t any confirmed cases of COVID-19 in any of the districts, so employees should just keep taking proper measures to make sure they wash their hands and stay six feet away from each other,"" the statement read. “That is NOT enough.”

Strong-Shaw told the Tribune that Brown has walked through the Daley Center to see whether proper procedures are being followed and that clerks have adequate supplies.

Strong-Shaw said the office had not been told by any employee or public health agency that any clerk has been diagnosed with COVID-19.

“We even asked the (Cook County Department of Public Health) to look up the name of an employee, whom the union provided as a suspected coronavirus case, and the CCDPH informed the Clerk’s Office that the person was not on the list of confirmed cases,” Strong-Shaw wrote in an email to the Tribune.

In a memo sent to clerks Thursday and obtained by the Tribune, Brown promised to scale back staffing and give clerks up to five days of compensatory time for working during the massive court shutdown, saying she wanted to show “appreciation for all of our hardworking and dedicated employees.”

In addition, beginning Friday, only a “skeleton crew” of staffers would be working, and procedures will be put in place to allow “employees in the high-risk categories” to work from home, according to the memo.

ADVERTISEMENT

But clerks at the criminal courthouse noted on Friday that the “skeleton crew” policy still required nearly everyone to show up for work — it simply let them shift their schedules around and work fewer hours.

Evans has ordered nearly all criminal and civil court operations postponed until April 15. Courthouses remain open, but with far fewer cases and courtroom activity. Still, many clerks have been required to go into work.

Several judges, who work side by side with clerks, told the Tribune they were outraged at the treatment of the integral court staffers.

One judge who presides over civil cases in the Daley Center said clerks are sitting in empty courtrooms with little to do. “The judges aren’t there but their clerks are,"" the judge said. ""It makes no sense.”"

You win if you can start to understand and control it.  Our disappointment seems to come from expectation: Expecting people to behave a certain way, to feel a certain way, to act a certain way, to treat us a certain way. When it doesn't happen the way we hoped, we feel hurt and let down *even if* the person had no malicious intentions, it can be perceived as pain by the one hoping for a different outcome.  So there's a fine line there. 

The moment I stopped expected things from people, the more content I became.  It's not so black and white though.  But being able to accept and admit that there had to have been times where you yourself were seen as the antagonist through someone else's eyes, is eye-opening.

I find the issue people seem to have is that they hold a measuring stick to wrongdoings: You deserved it, I did not.   Pain is pain.

I dunno man.  I have found a combo of less expectations, and letting the trash take itself out, to be a sinning equation in my life.

But man, watching these idiots freak out over the coronavirus is really challenging me. But I am able to recognize that really comes from a core place of, ""They are not behaving how I would, or how I believe they should, therefore I am now annoyed.""  We are all the same."

I happen to have had a lot of incoming amazon packages to my house before shit went down, and i sprayed all six sides with lysol spray before i brought them into the house. i also let them air dry overnight before opening the packages. the contents got the same treatment as well. I washed my hands after each time i touched the boxes because times are weird and who knows.

BUT i did read a very good study about survival times for virus' survival rates [and possibly more specifically about covid19, though i believe it was about virus' in general] on different surfaces, you'll have to google 'covi19 {and/or} cardboard' or something similar to find it, but it did suggest that covid19 has a lower survival time on cardboard because of its fibrous nature (something like 12-24 hrs, vs the survival rate on non-porous surfaces, like steel and plastic and stuff which was something like 72 hrs or something {though copper surfaces seemed to kill it off in 4 hours or so, according to this study}. it's seems mostly to concern the airflow and the drying out of the ""shell""/if it is 'encapsulated', of the virus.

so basically, longer time exposed to desiccating/drying air and surfaces and/or plus things that kill virus' lead to a better result for having a non-contagious surface.

alternatively, you can use quaternary ammonium which restaurants and horticulture use on surfaces to sanitize and kill molds, bacteria and VIRUS'. it's a TBS per GALLON of water to kill most everything, and 2 TBS per GALLON if I was trying to hose the shit out of everything to protect my at risk mom. it's sold by the gallon depending on the concentration, but the ratios I gave here are based on a pretty concentrated source, like protect your eyes and skin strength.
best to buy it from a restaurant supply store or online and use it at the manufacturers maximum recommended dilution.

CAVEAT: I'm neither a dr., a scientist, nor a chemist. I'm just someone who grows clean weed for medical patients. I use some variation of these practices to sanitize all of the equipment and surfaces in my grow room before and after any grow cycle."

Health Minister David Clark revealed the new restrictions for the ailing hospitality sector, impacted hard by the coronavirus pandemic, this afternoon.

The guidelines developed between the Government, Hospitality New Zealand and SkyCity Entertainment Group, set out how the new restrictions on physical distancing and the limit of 100 people in an indoor space will work in bars and restaurants and other hospitality and entertainment venues.

They include implementing a Covid-19 guest register of everyone in a venue and undertaking regular head counts of people in a venue.

It also includes configuring electronic gaming machines to allow appropriate physical distancing of at least 1m and limiting table games at a casino to five persons per table.”"

Dr. Francis Boyle created the Bio-Weapons act for the United States and he is one of the most qualified people in the World on this subject. He noted that this study actually took place inside the United States, North Carolina(2) to be precise, with FDA approval. But with Chinese Government funding - US and Chinese governmental cooperation to produce a Bio-weapon.

Dr. Francis Boyle did not speculate on how the virus came to be found in Wuhan. But what if there was evidence of this virus before Wuhan? This would be the smoking gun, as Francis puts it, to its physical origin as the aforementioned study was to it being engineered.

Let's go back in time, to August 2019. A military lab was shut down due to safety issues(3)which occurred at the same time as deaths in the surrounding area due to a ""Flu like"" disease that was blamed on vaping (3.1). Location of the lab? A couple of hundred miles from where COVID19 was produced - a military lab named Fort Detrick, Maryland(4).

Presumably it was spreading and you'd have seen a very high incidence of flu like issues across the area?

October 2019, """"When the outbreak began, “we started to receive calls from the parents, from the urgent care (centers) with people coming in with some difficulty breathing, wheezing, lethargy, fever. Chest X-rays were showing congestion in lungs and classical signs of pneumonia,” Cook said.""

Yes, you're reading that correctly. From an article titled ""Pneumonia Outbreak Reported in Marshall County Schools"" (5).

More curiously, they stated 30 children in total had it, but in the comments you find the following comment by a Lisa Lewis Chambers stating ""There are more than 30 confirmed cases just at Cameron elementary. So someone is wrong somewhere"" indicating a cover-up of the true figures.

Immediately after this incident a very curiously timed exercise occurred, ""Event 201"" - A Global Pandemic Exercise (6), where a significant part of this exercise was combating ""fake news"". This was nothing more than working out how to control the narrative using social media and restrict the flow of information regarding the pandemic. Why on earth would that be a prime issue under normal circumstances when there are lives at stake?

The last piece - the Military games that took place in Wuhan in the middle to end of October. Days before the first reported cases arose in Wuhan (7).

**Turns out that same lab was where the MK-NAOAMI operation was given the job of creating a virus to lower the population:-**

https://ibb.co/GxP1YcN

""MKNAOMI was the code name for a joint Department of Defense/CIA research program lasting from the 1950s through the 1970s. Unclassified information about the MKNAOMI program and the related Special Operations Division is scarce. It is generally reported to be a successor to the MKULTRA project and to have focused on biological projects including biological warfare agents—specifically, to store materials that could either incapacitate or kill a test subject and to develop devices for the diffusion of such materials.[1][2][3][4][5] ""

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_MKNAOMI



**The cherry on top:-**

A Taiwanese physician noted that in August of 2019 the US had a flurry of lung pneumonias or similar, which the Americans blamed on ‘vaping’ from e-cigarettes, but which, according to the scientist, the symptoms and conditions could not be explained by e-cigarettes. He said he wrote to the US officials telling them he suspected those deaths were likely due to the coronavirus. He claims his warnings were ignored.

Japanese and Taiwanese epidemiologists and pharmacologists have determined that the new coronavirus could have originated in the US since that country is the only one known to have all five types – from which all others must have descended. Wuhan in China has only one of those types, rendering it in analogy as a kind of “branch” which cannot exist by itself but must have grown from a “tree”.

https://defence.pk/pdf/threads/us-military-might-have-brought-coronavirus-to-wuhan-china.656683/page-2


-------------------------------------------------------------------

A theory:
USA accidentally or otherwise leaked a strain of this virus in the USA, possibly a weaker variant. After it began spreading there was an effort to cover it up using the excuse of a vaping illness/early and harsh flu season. A separate plan was concocted to introduce a worse variant in China during the military games to be able to say it originated from the Chinese. It is possible this variant was targeting Chinese genetics specifically.

The Chinese worked this out and may have released their own variant of this disease, which affects everyone but they were also intentionally hiding their true numbers to ensure no Country took action too early. The secret services of various Countries (UK/European) may have been aware of the initial situation and knew it would not ravage their own populations and responded accordingly, hence the it's just a ""flu"". Or certain people there too wanted the virus to spread. 

Event 201 was the process of normalizing extreme censorship and propaganda to ensure the right narrative remains at all times because once parts of this comes out, if people see it they will understand everything isn't quite as it seems. The only option is to ensure they simply do not see it.

Those behind this virus will use it to usher in a new era, just like 9/11 was."

Like some people really have started entering some kind of panic mode. Or maybe I'm just getting old. lol

But for real, something definitely seems weird. I could actually see martial law take place if current trends continue. Somethings up. Either coronavirus is super deadly actually or they're trying to get in front of something else. 

If nothing else, this at least makes for a good LARP. But we really are living in unprecedented times. The largest cities in the country are being shut down. States are shutting down. Countries are shutting down. The economy is shutting down. And China is trying to buy a lot of goodwill."

2020-03-21,Zarski843,Coronavirus,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/flvdic/daily_discussion_post_march_20_questions_images/fl30t6o/,"Why should I take the coronavirus seriously? This is a serious question. I am not trying to antagonize or downplay the severity of the virus. I do my part, I try my best to prevent spreading it, I wash my hands constantly, I sanitize my hands any time I can, I don’t really go out and do things I don’t have to do anymore, hell, I even broke my awful long-time habit of biting my nails. I genuinely just want to hear from others about this.

But I’m not understanding the huge amount of attention this virus is receiving. I think I’m just one of those people that became jaded with people forcing their opinions down your throat on social media, and I genuinely stopped watching the news because the spirit of keeping the people informed was completely lost in the past decade. I see how the media handles mass shootings and other major stories, they’ll latch onto one mass shooting for weeks without stop because it generates some buzz, while others (sometimes far more serious) stopped getting mentioned after a few days because it just didn’t catch any buzz. 

I question whether this virus is the same thing. Again I don’t doubt it’s happening, I don’t doubt it’s a serious threat, but the mass fear, economic disaster, and closing of communities seems excessive. The numbers of H1N1 in 2009 were substantially worse. Even the numbers of the seasonal flu in the United States are substantially worse each year. 

Why is this being taken more seriously by leaders compared to other outbreaks? Again, I do my part, and I see the tragedy in Italy and China, but a lot of the problem has been worsened by widespread panic. Why should I believe this is more serious than it feels like right now?"

You’re talking about letting the elderly or otherwise vulnerable population of prisons out early so they aren’t trapped in literal cells to catch coronavirus, not pardoning death-row inmates.  Not everyone in jail or prison has hurt someone, plenty of people are stuck in jail for non-violent offenses.  

Even if we assume that only 25% of incarcerated Americans are actually non-violent, that makes for more than 500,000 non-violent inmates across America potentially being exposed to this virus.

You claim that you could hold and test everyone coming in immediately, so how would you do that without causing a massive upheaval?

You say you would threaten complete travel freeze in order to get everyone to take the test. Do you mean literally everyone? You’re suggesting the President makes threats to its people? How does that play out for you?

All the places you cited as doing extremely well at handling the virus? You realize Singapore and Hong Kong are cities, which is actually slightly smaller than the US, a nation. Taiwan is an island, and South Korea is smaller than the us. Why did these places act better? Maybe Bc they had an easier ability to due to geography (South Korea has one border where no one crosses), size (obviously), and also because of proximity to the outbreak, meaning they might have more information.

This Coronavirus will turn out to just be the trigger to an avalanche of issues that will have to be worked out in a recessionary environment much like we saw in 2009 and 2010 but hopefully with better ideas and less gimmicks than we saw from the last guy. Companies will retool and will not go back to the old way of doing things.

He could try to start a conversation with his employer about trying to make the work environment as safe as they can. Employer could remind and encourage employees to monitor themselves diligently and call out if they have *any* symptoms (in many hospital systems, they require employees to take their temperature before clocking in to work to ensure they don't have a fever).

I don't know how applicable this is to his work environment, but it's very common, especially now, for hospital employees to strip their work outfit in the garage, throw them in the washing machine, and take a shower, first thing returning home. 

I know it's often 'hopeless' to try to have this conversation with a life-long smoker, but this could be a time to give another shot at quitting. The [AZ Ashline](https://ashline.org/) is a great resource that, for example, will provide you with 2 weeks of free smoking cessation aids along with free 'quit counseling,' which apparently has been shown to double one's chance of quitting successfully. 

You could try to arrange some logistics so that he doesn't have to go out unnecessarily. A family member who doesn't have any symptoms could potentially grab groceries for him when they go to the grocery store, and he could stock up on a supply of his meds so that he doesn't need to go out for refills. (Do keep in good contact with him if he's isolating himself!)

Some last small tips may sound a bit woo woo, but bear with me. These tips aren't specific to coronavirus, but are general tips to correct problems that weaken the immune system: [get good sleep, try to reduce stress, try not to drink too much, and consider taking vitamin D if there's any chance you're low -- a common problem.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/10/well/live/can-i-boost-my-immune-system.html).

 No setor de telemarketing, o sindicato dos trabalhadores [relata não ter havido redução nas equipes](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/mercado/2020/03/fechamento-de-shoppings-centers-preocupa-lojistas-e-funcionarios.shtml) nem a criação de escalas para reduzir o número de pessoas nos espaços. Assustados com o risco de contaminação, os trabalhadores do setor foram às ruas.

 O protesto de um grupo de operadores de telemarketing em Belo Horizonte, nesta sexta-feira (20), ecoou reivindicações vistas em outras cidades. Os gritos pediam para “[parar de uma vez pela saúde](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/mercado/2020/03/corte-de-salario-preservara-empregos-dizem-analistas.shtml)”. Os cartazes traziam frases como “fechem os call center”; “não podemos morrer na PA (posto de atendimento)”, “cadê a humanização”.

 Vídeos gravados por trabalhadores da Mundiale, na capital mineira, mostram que, mesmo em meio à pandemia, o local de trabalho e refeição segue lotado e falta álcool em gel para ser utilizado na higienização, como é recomendado pela OMS (Organização Mundial da Saúde).

 Na tarde de quinta-feira (19), a empresa, que não respondeu ao contato da **Folha**, avisou que seriam liberados para home office —trabalho remoto em casa— [funcionários com mais vendas](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/mercado/2020/03/coronavirus-atrasa-chegada-de-eletronicos-chineses-na-25-de-marco.shtml) e que o uso de álcool em gel seria livre.

 Segundo uma funcionária que pediu anonimato, por medo de ser demitida, mesmo pessoas em grupo de risco —como idosos, pessoas com problemas respiratórios e grávidas— seguem

  trabalhando. Belo Horizonte tem 20 casos confirmados.

 “Temos um caso confirmado dentro da empresa, de uma supervisora. A equipe dela está toda com suspeita, e mesmo assim não querem nos liberar. O álcool em gel acaba antes da jornada de trabalho e está complicado”, diz ela.

 O protesto de operadores se repetiu em outras cidades do país, como Recife, Curitiba, Goiânia e São Paulo. Também nesta sexta (20), cerca de 50 funcionários da Almaviva do Brasil se manifestaram no centro da capital paulista.

 Entre os funcionários há pelo menos dois casos confirmados de infecção pelo coronavírus, que foram afastados. A empresa tem fornecido apenas um desinfetante para ser passado nas mesas de trabalho, dizem os relatos.

 A **Folha** fez várias tentativas de contato com a empresa, mas não teve resposta até a publicação desta reportagem. Os operadores têm média de jornada diária de 6 horas e 20 minutos e, em geral, recebem um salário mínimo.

 Em Recife, funcionários da Liq reivindicam que seja feito rodízio, mantendo 50% no local de trabalho por turno, para garantir a distância segura. A empresa diz que tomou todas as providências de limpeza, seguindo recomendações, e que liberou pessoas de grupos de risco e 20% do contingente.

 Operadores da Atento Brasil se manifestaram em Goiânia reclamando que o álcool disponibilizado é usado para limpeza e que foram proibidos de usar máscaras. Eles pedem a suspensão das atividades, para evitar aglomerações.

 “Passamos de 6 a 8 horas por dia em um ambiente fechado, com ar-condicionado e inúmeras pessoas. Sem contar que a grande maioria depende do transporte público, que ainda hoje está lotado e nos obriga a ter contato físico direto com várias pessoas”, diz uma operadora. 

 O presidente da Atento, Dimitrius Oliveira, gravou um vídeo dizendo aos funcionários que a empresa segue todos os protocolos e que traz melhores ambientes, para que operadores estejam confortáveis.

 Por meio de nota, a empresa diz que prioriza atuação em home office e afastamento remunerado de colaboradores com mais de 60 anos e gestantes. Mas, segundo relatos, trabalhadores com problemas respiratórios estão trabalhando normalmente.

 Em Curitiba, operadores da BTCC também reclamaram da falta de álcool em gel, ar-condicionado ligado e janelas fechadas e aglomerações em elevadores e locais de refeição, o que vai contra as recomendações de prevenção.

 “A gente chega e a gente tem que limpar nossa PA. Usamos álcool em gel da empresa, quando tem, mas temos que pegar com copo descartável para limpar. Eles estão comunicando que está havendo roubo do álcool e por isso falta”, diz uma trabalhadora.

 Os trabalhadores querem que a empresa pare as atividades, já que nem todos possuem internet ou computador para trabalhar em casa.

 “Não é essencial fazer uma venda em um momento destes. O cliente não depende disso”, afirma ela.

 Após o protesto, janelas foram abertas, mas outras medidas não foram implementadas, segundo trabalhadores. Na página oficial da empresa no Facebook, a BTCC respondeu a um comentário dizendo que em breve compartilharia o plano de ação e que a limpeza era feita no turno da noite.

 A ABT (Associação Brasileira de Telesserviços), que representa 18 empresas de contact center, diz que é essencial que o setor siga em operação, já que tem serviços de emergências médias, energia e comunicações. 

 Os trabalhadores e empresas da construção civil avançam no campo da negociação. Nesta sexta, na capital paulista, conseguiram alterar a convenção coletiva prevendo a redução das jornadas de trabalho para evitar horário de pico no transporte público e turnos diferenciados.

 Até que a crise gerada pela pandemia se estabilize, as empresas poderão dar férias coletivas e individuais sem a necessidade de comunicação 30 dias antes.

 O novo prazo passa a ser de dois dias, e as férias poderão ter início a qualquer dia da semana.

 O acordo antecipa a apresentação da medida que vai flexibilizar a redução de salário e jornada e prevê a possibilidade de redução de até 25% dos salários caso as empresas tenham que paralisar obras para garantir a segurança. Se o governo mandar a proposta anunciada na quarta-feira (18), a redução poderá ser 50%. O trabalhador incluído nesse corte terá direito à estabilidade no emprego.

 O Sinduscon-SP (Sindicato da Indústria da Construção de São Paulo) encaminhou às empresas uma série de recomendações para reduzir os risco de contaminação, mas isso não inclui suspensão do trabalho.

 O Sindicato dos Metalúrgicos de São Paulo e Mogi das Cruzes encaminhou nesta semana às empresas um documento falando da necessidade de preservar a saúde dos trabalhadores.

 Miguel Torres, presidente do sindicato e da Força Sindical, diz que o ofício informou também da disposição dos trabalhadores em discutir medidas de garantia de emprego, mas que a prioridade é a saúde e o enfrentamento da pandemia.

 Nos bares e restaurantes, por determinação da prefeitura, o atendimento ao público será interrompido, e a recomendação da Abrasel-SP (Associação de Bares e Restaurantes em São Paulo) é para que os empresários reorganizem as operações e aguardem a consolidação das medidas anunciadas pelo governo.

 No início da noite desta sexta, o presidente nacional da Abrasel, Paulo Solmucci, enviou uma mensagem aos associados pedindo paciência aos donos de bares e restaurantes. “Peço a todos que não se precipitem com férias coletivas ou demissões”, diz.

 Entre os bancários, a briga agora é pela liberação da obrigação de cumprir metas de vendas de produtos (como seguros) durante a crise. Eles brigam também pela ampliação do teletrabalho hoje somente pessoas dos grupos de risco ou que tiveram contato com casos suspeitos estão trabalhando em casa."

From an immunologist at Johns Hopkins University...

Feeling confused as to why Coronavirus is a bigger deal than Seasonal flu?  Here it is in a nutshell.   I hope this helps.  Feel free to share this to others who don’t understand...   

It has to do with RNA sequencing....  I.e. genetics.

Seasonal flu is an “all human virus”.  The DNA/RNA chains that make up the virus are recognized by the human immune system.  This means that your body has some immunity to it before it comes around each year...  you get immunity two ways...through exposure to a virus, or by getting a flu shot.  

Novel viruses, come from ANIMALS....the WHO (World Health Organization) tracks novel viruses in animals, (sometimes for years watching for mutations). Usually these viruses only transfer from animal to animal (pigs in the case of H1N1) (birds in the case of the Spanish flu).  But once one of these animal viruses mutates, and starts to transfer from animals to humans... then it’s a problem. Why? Because we have no natural or acquired immunity. The RNA sequencing of the genes inside the virus isn’t human, and the human immune system doesn’t recognize it so, we can’t fight it off. 

Now sometimes, the mutation only allows transfer from animal to human. For years it’s only transmission is from an infected animal to a human, before it finally mutates so that it can now transfer human to human. Once that happens, we have a new contagion phase.  And depending on the fashion of this new mutation, that’s what decides how contagious, or how deadly it’s gonna be.

H1N1 was deadly, but it did not mutate in a way that was as deadly as the Spanish flu.    It’s RNA was slower to mutate and it attacked its host differently too.  

Fast forward. 

Now, here comes this Coronavirus... it existed in animals only, for nobody knows how long...but one day, at an animal market, in Wuhan China in December 2019, it mutated and made the jump from ANIMAL TO PEOPLE.  At first, only animals could give it to a person... But here is the scary part.... in just TWO WEEKS it mutated AGAIN and gained the ability to jump from human to human.   Scientists call this quick ability, “slippery”

This Coronavirus, not being in any form a “human” virus (whereas we would all have some natural or acquired immunity), took off like a rocket!! And this was because humans have no known immunity...doctors have no known medicines for it.

And it just so happens that this particular mutated animal virus, changed itself in such a way that it causes great damage to human lungs.

That’s why Coronavirus is different from seasonal flu, or H1N1 or any other type of influenza....  this one is slippery AF.   And it’s a lung eater...And, it’s already mutated AGAIN, so that we now have two strains to deal with, strain s, and strain L....which makes it twice as hard to develop a vaccine.

We really have no tools in our shed, with this.  History has shown that fast and immediate closings of public places has helped in the past pandemics. Philadelphia and Baltimore were reluctant to close events in 1918 and they were the hardest hit in the US during the Spanish Flu. 

Factoid:  Henry VIII stayed in his room and allowed no one near him, till the Black Plague passed...(honestly...I understand him so much better now). Just like us, he had no tools in his shed, except social isolation...

And let me end by saying....right now it’s hitting older folks harder... but this genome is so slippery...if it mutates again (and it will). Who is to say, what it will do next.  

Be smart folks...  acting like you’re unafraid is so not sexy right now, and frankly stupid and selfish."

People aren't mad at Trump for not preventing this. They are mad that he didn't take it seriously and that he didn't do simple things that could have limited the spread and the impact. 

TLDR: Korea formed a task force early to loosen restrictions on creating test kits allowing private businesses to ramp up production. This allowed Korea to test quickly and in high numbers. 

The Korean government was open and honest about the threat and dedicated in their tracking of infected people.

> I love r/wallstreetbets for its content as well but simply have one question. Why do you feel the need to reiterate over and over in multiple comments to people on here that you predicted the market, doubled your portfolio, and implied that those that held are ignorant? No one is interested in hearing that and it provides no value whatsoever as a discussion. The majority of people on this subreddit engage in the buy and hold strategy if they are investing in high quality long-term stocks and many people here don’t attempt to time the market. Your comments are more suited toward r/wallstreetbets. Have a good day, this is where I end my side of the discussion.

My response:

Fair question. I do this because people need to hear the opposing side. It IS possible to beat the market. It IS possible to have predicted this drop. People need to know that returns are commensurate to how informed they are, even with a buy and hold strategy.

I spent a significant amount of time combing through world news and reading about the coronavirus, skimming scientific papers, reading supporting and opposing theories on Reddit. If I can do it anyone can, so long as they have the desire and willingness to learn and realize this was not an impossible prediction nor an uneducated guess.

Many people here get fed the false premise that no matter what they do, they will never beat the market. Well guess what, this is what happens if you do nothing and put zero effort into managing your portfolio. This is the definition of ignorance. Which, mind you, is par for the course with a buy and hold strategy, but there's also more to investing than that.

What irks me is for these people to then come out with their uninformed statements encouraging others to buy the dip when anyone with a clue have liquidated their holdings and are waiting this out. The blind are leading the blind and all I see are people that will lose money by buying in too soon.

> The majority of people on this subreddit engage in the buy and hold strategy if they are investing in high quality long-term stocks and many people here don’t attempt to time the market.

Being informed is not timing the market. All I have to say.

> Your comments are more suited toward /r/wallstreetbets 

My comments are perfectly suited for those who are interested and willing to devote time into learning how to manage their portfolios, that there is more to investing than just buy and hold, and that such a thing called risk management exists.

I apologize if I came across harsh, I hope things go well on your end (health-wise and your portfolio!)."

I tried to include this in my body but I forgot that we can't do that on this subreddit (if current events is what you're referring to with your comment). 

It was just an honest and random question that I had thought of a few minutes ago. What brought this question about was me watching one of my friends become very angry and defensive about something (not towards me) and then everyone else in the group began getting really angry and defensive too towards another person. So in a sense, the emotion of one caused some sort of ""Mob mentality"" within the group that I had witnessed. I have a bachelor's in Psych and another friend in my group who is in a PhD program (we aren't Psychologists yet) were able to stay really calm and rational and we were attempting to restore the peace. We both didn't fall for ""group think"" I would say.. or maybe we did? I'm not sure. So that's just one reason I'm asking.

They might say that the virus was manufactured by either a) Japan and use it as an excuse to start war, like what they did when the Emperor died; or b) by whatever resistance group and use that as a reason to make the public side with the GNR even more.

If it was a natural occurrence like with what is happening with the coronavirus, they'll probably kill anyone who is trying to find out the truth so as to not interfere with the narrative they are trying to play.

They will definitely skip using animals for trials and just go straight ahead with human trials using blacks and jews as soon as they start working on a vaccine."

However... there is no detail of who is eligible and or companies make claims. This line stood out  ""It will pay 80% of wages for employees unable to work due to the coronavirus pandemic"". Does this mean only mean businesses directly impacted, e.g. those that have been told my the Government to close down, rather than businesses who have closed voluntarily or who are struggling due to lack of work, lost clients, etc. will be eligible?

As with anything to do with the Government, the devil's in the details. By all means speak to your bosses, but be very wary of false promises, as until the full details are announced no body knows for sure how this is going to work in practice."

2020-03-21,begin-it,slatestarcodex,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/slatestarcodex/comments/flyz6c/future_covid19_predictions/fl36bcw/,"I say we’re locked down in 1 week. Not federally, but that the vast majority of states have imposed mandatory lockdown measures which maintain some freedoms (can walk around a bit but not in groups) yet are prosecutable. Federally the government will voice support for the state based measures.

I predict that in one week the US will be like at as the nation which is going to far surpass Italy levels of cases and we will be in a state of all out crisis. 

This will cause a panic and the predictions will be that the ensuing recession will be worse than 2008 and possibly rival the Great Depression. (However I doubt that things will get as bad socially as the Great Depression, due to government intervention. Hopefully that’s not just blind optimism). 

In one month we’ll have the messaging that full on quarantine measures are necessary in order that we can ever leave this hell like situation, and there will be more examples of countries successfully leaving the acute crisis phase (Italy in recovery and low rates of new infections for over a week now, now commonly accepted that social tracing and mass testing is the way out as seen in SK and other nations). By this point there will be approved treatments for people who are sick and the earliest results from vaccine trials will make news but still be far off. 

By one year, the world is largely in recovery as the global economy rises with some vigor. A vaccine will either have recently been invented or is currently coming out. COVID19 will only have isolated hotspot pockets which are extremely mild compared to today, but this was only achieved through intensive testing and monitoring, which some people will complain has dipped into surveillance state territory. 

Commentators will meanwhile talk about how the crisis changed our attitudes globally in various ways. Public opinion has moved more towards the idea that the government should support the citizens and provide stronger safety nets. The pandemic will be increasingly spoken of as both a precursor to the crises of climate change, and as a hopeful glimpse into a pollution free world, and will be used as a reference from here on out of how we were able to stop everything and come together against an enemy. Others will lament how the crisis reinforced nationalism and xenophobia globally. Indeed coronavirus will be cited as a justification for nationalism and closed borders. Attitudes towards hygiene have been altered. Wearing a mask in public becomes more common in the west, although still a minority. Many opinion pieces will emerge about how we need to bring industry home and more localized. However this talk fizzles out as we begin to move into the next moment of national and global focus."

At peak crisis, Wuhan had [10% of China's critical care staff](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/02/26/coronavirus-china-health-care-system-under-pressure-in-wuhan.html), despite 1% of the population. The amount of resources going to that one state are unfathomable for any other country to comprehend, really, I wouldn't be surprised if the number of ECMO machines they'd moved to that city was a multiple of Australia's entire count.

They were also forced to make a decision pretty early on about whether or not to cancel NY, and did so back in Jan 23 when they had fewer cases than we do now. Food for thought :("
