2. They were also caught creating [fakes](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hobby_Lobby_smuggling_scandal) of artifacts for their for-profit Christian museum, including fragments of Dead Sea Scrolls and a small Bible supposedly carried to the moon.

3. They fought against [covering women for contraception](https://www.chicagotribune.com/business/ct-hobby-lobby-smuggling-20170706-story.html) by the Affordable Care Act on the grounds that it violated the owner’s religious beliefs... and won.

He did an on demand doc visit and the doc told him he can't get a test because he doesn't meet all criteria (he didn't travel - as if that matters anymore since all U.S. states have cases and local p2p) and that he's going to diagnose him as having bronchitis and prescribed him an antibiotic...so doctors' are purposely giving wrong diagnosis for people with COVID19 symptoms.

He called the doc again about a test and was denied again, so he just said, ""Ok I guess I'll just go to work then."" - At that the doc said no you are to self isolate and my friend said why you just diagnosed me for bronchitis so why do I need to? Then the doc agreed to approve him for test, so he called hospital, hospital tells him do not come here just stay home. Told to wait for a call. 

He's gotten worse so he called the hospital today again and they said no he has to wait for a call but he's feeling really bad, he said he was gonna go in and they told him, ""No you're not coming to this hospital."" And hung up on him.

Hydroxychloroquine might be an effective treatment for the Coronavirus pandemic. It’s cheap and is readily available all around the world.

Yesterday this doctor (who does research for Gilead) posted this tweet saying he was dying because of Hydroxychloroquine and that he desperately needed specifically Remdesivir (a drug manufactured by Gilead).

Big Pharma appears to be fighting to be to the ones to provide treatment for this pandemic, for obvious monetary reasons. They are shilling against the cheap and readily available medicine so they can profit off of the pandemic.

We are walking head first into a proper outbreak here because people (after numerous daily updates and advice) still don’t know that the safest thing you can do is stay home if you aren’t a key worker! The fact that the government is having to introduce emergency legislation to FORCE pubs to close speaks volumes. We are a nation full of people who think they are invincible / the health system will save the day. Privilege is outstanding here.

Edit: also, might I add- it wasn’t until say two weeks ago did I hear another person speaking sensibly about this virus. The narrative for about three months in the U.K. was that it is all a bunch of rubbish. Two months ago if you expressed concern for this virus people would laugh at you."

The line of thinkingg to giving the big corporations money is based on “Trickle Down Economics,” where, long story short, giving money to the top gives those companies the money that they need to keep workers employed and giving them money while not going bankrupt (liquidity).  
  
*However*, what inevitably happens in America is that those big corporations take the”stimulus package” (or bailout) and *still* fire a large portion of their staff, and take the money from the gov’t to pay massive bonuses to their executives and higher ups (people who don’t even remotely need the money). They may also “buy back their stock,” which refers to the amount of the company that was sold off to raise money to keep it from going bankrupt—by buying back their stock, the company doesn’t actually need to change anything.  
  
TL;DR: gov’t gives money to companies to hand out to their employees, companies instead choose to keep the money and give to upper 1% for more yachts. It happened in ‘09 and dems are trying to keep it from happening again."

Here's my impression after living here in China for a decade plus.

It's certainly arguable that the American system is better than the Chinese system. In general, I might even agree. But I think most people conceptualize the difference is a matter of *category* (America = democracy = good! China = authoritarian = evil!), while I'd argue that it's really a matter of *degree*.

To give a specific example, while the situation's shifted a bit in the past years... for a long time at least getting out of trouble (or giving someone trouble) was just a matter of finding the right government official and bribing them for the correct amount. Let's say you unlawfully terminated some of your employees. They're making noise, so... you find the right person in the government, give them a hongbao of USD $15-50k, and the problem goes away.

Most Americans would say, ""how terrible! how corrupt! Thank god we have the superior fair Democratic system!"" But how different **is** it really, *de facto*? A company can pay for good lawyers, which the workers can't. The good lawyers are able to find a way to exonerate the company in court. The rich win, the workers get screwed. The only true difference is that it's the lawyers that gets the cash instead of the government official!

Many people strike down these sorts of arguments as 'whataboutism'... and you know what? I'm also completely willing to say that America being unethical in some areas certainly doesn't exonerate other governments for doing similar or worse actions. As long as people are *also* willing to go with me and admit that the true difference is one of degree, and not category.

China functions much more like a 'normal' country than many people seem to think. That's not to say that 'normal' is necessarily 'good', and certainly no one is immune from criticism. But it's just something to always keep in mind in the back of your brain."

Even though they're right on China's doorstep and have tremendous economic connections to China, Taiwan has had only 169 cases with 2 deaths.

One of the ways they've managed this feat is by having enough masks for their population.  For the US to similarly beat back the infection, the US will need to make a similar amount of masks per capita, about 165 million, *per day*.

165 million is a big number, but not an impossible number.  100 million of countless products are made in the US every day.  Softdrinks, candy bars, hamburgers.  It goes on and on.  

But 3M and the other mask suppliers had closed most of their US mask factories and moved them to China.  When Corona Virus hit, China prevented the 3M factories in China from exporting any medical products.

This exact situation had been predicted for years.  That in a pandemic, no nation would allow meaningful amounts of medical supplies to be exported.  The experts were correct.  They said there need to be tariffs on imported masks and other critical medical supplies in order to make domestic production sustainable.  But the goverment refused to take action.

It's more than possible to make 165 million masks per day.  But Trump needs to get off his ass and demand industry start making them."

He pushed for Robert Mugabe to be the goodwill ambassador. Russia has the worst TB situation outside Africa but he hired a Russian to lead the TB taskforce after a meeting with Putin. Even the Lancet published an editorial criticizing it saying it is a political decision that undermines WHO's technical expertise.

He is undertaking a reorganization of WHO that has nothing to do with fixing issues but with getting his personal choices on top positions under the guise of diversity. Apparently it's a 'campaign promise'. He also got a German a top position after being invited to G20 summit.

Not to mention, before WHO, he was accused of covering up three cholera epidemics in Ethiopia as the health minister. (How did he come to power btw? With an armed coup in the 90s)"

“Chloroquine, a relatively safe, effective and cheap drug used for treating many human diseases including malaria, amoebiosis and human immunodeficiency virus is effective in inhibiting the infection and spread of SARS CoV in cell culture. The fact that the drug has significant inhibitory antiviral effect when the susceptible cells were treated either prior to or after infection suggests a possible prophylactic and therapeutic use.”
