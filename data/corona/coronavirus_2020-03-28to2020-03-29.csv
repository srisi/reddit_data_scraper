>Since we're seeing goods, essential medical equipment and treatments, and even rent being price gouged, how does this sit with the idea that markets can regulate themselves without oversight? 

When prices go up in a free market, it encourages production (more profit to be made means it's a good idea to make more of it), competition (if existing players refuse to produce more, new companies can take the newly available profit), and discourages hoarding (if prices go up, I'll think twice about whether I *really* need 5000 rolls of toilet paper).  

In our current situation, price gouging laws are preventing the above from working, which is making shortages happen.  When nobody has an incentive to produce more things and no disincentive from hoarding, causing shortages.

Price gouging sounds worse than shortages (""only rich people can afford stuff?"") But remember that the word ""shortage"" is just another name for price gouging where the price is infinity.  

If the above things were allowed to happen, production and competition would provide for everyone's needs and eventually the prices would come down.  Potentially even lower than they were before the crisis (due to startup costs).

One thing too with things like medical supplies: its precisely the government that is preventing those things from being produced.  Its literally a crime to produce PPE right now which is why there is so much shortage of it.  Its literally a crime to produce tests.  [Many well researched articles](https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2020/mar/23/dan-crenshaw/did-fda-regulations-slow-testing-coronavirus/) demonstrated that FDA regulatory interference prevented (and continues to prevent) access to testing.  If you are wondering why theres no testing or masks despite everyone wanting them, think about what would happen if pot or cocaine suddenly became a coronavirus cure.  Do you think the availability of cocaine would go up?  By making testing, ppe, and medical treatment a crime to produce, the FDA *literally* has blood on their hands.

>I'm genuinely curious if anyone is feeling a little weird about how this whole thing is playing out versus how you thought the world worked. 

Not really.  If anything its validated it.   Regulations on the market are causing shortages.  Regulations on drugs and testing are causing people to die.  The private sector is [begging](https://www.gq.com/story/inside-americas-coronavirus-testing-crisis) the government to let them step in and solve it.

In response to the crisis, laws restricting uber drivers from delivering alcohol have been rescinded, the police have stopped enforcing victimless crimes to deal with the crisis, non essential courts are shut down, nonviolent offenders are being released from prison, laws restricting occupational medical licenses are being relaxed, right to try legislation is being advocated, people are relaxing or ignoring IP and patent laws for medical devices and drugs in the rush to provide respirators and treatments.

Hell, income taxes are being suspended and people are getting UBI!

It's like a laundry list of things that libertarians have been asking for *this whole damn time*.  Its almost like these things arent actually super useful or important and doing without them makes things work faster and better.

>Follow-up question: When you heard about some politicians saying they're willing to die or they're willing to let the death toll go up for the sake of the economy, what did that make you think/feel?

I think that those people are assholes, who are usually hypocrites.  90% of them stand behind spending trillions to enforce border restrictions and go to war on foreign soil just to protect the 200 Americans/year who die of Islamic terrorism.  If they sincerely believe that spending on stimulus and returning to a 2016 economic to save literally millions of lives isnt worth the cost then fuck them.

That being said, I think its possible to steelman their position a bit:  North Korea doesn't really have a problem with the coronavirus after all...but they do have 0 economy and most of their population is malnourished and eating bark and living as literal slaves.   If we instituted total martial law and arrested everyone who left their house and executed everyone with a cough on sight like they do, we could certainly stop the virus.  But wouldnt that be throwing the baby out with the bathwater?"

The first batch of tests we had were faulty, so we had to start from scratch (China is *still* producing faulty tests). Information about this virus has changed rapidly throughout this situation. For example, mainstream news sources like USA Today (among others) compared the virus to the flu and many doctors were claiming that the fear of the coronavirus was overblown in comparison to the flu. Trump reflects this information by saying ""it's like the flu"" (which is not innacurate because I believe he was talking about the symptoms) and a week later when information changes, his quote is looked back on and criticized as being misleading and irresponsible.

China on the other hand, actively suppressed information from getting to the outside world and if it wasn't for one Chinese doctor defying the govt and getting the word out (who is now dead from ""the coronavirus"" at age 34), we would have been even less prepared.

You can blame the Trump admin for missteps within the US, but China is responsible for preventing the entire world from being prepared for this. It is not comparable."

Is this your position? If so, then yes, you are correct on a technical level. Looking only at the plain meaning of his words, the president never denied the existence of the virus. However, a rhetorical analysis does not end at the dictionary definitions of the words. We must look deeper. In this case, the president does appear to be denying the seriousness of the situation, rebuffing any criticism of his handling of the virus, and praising his response.

Per the Snopes' article, he said ""this is their new hoax. But you know, we did something that’s been pretty amazing. We’re 15 people \[cases of coronavirus infection\] in this massive country. And because of the fact that we went early, we went early, we could have had a lot more than that.""

Trump called it a political hoax by the democrats, which to many people indicated that Trump did not take the virus seriously. Holding a political rally was another indication to many people that Trump did not take the virus seriously or believe in the dangers that came with it. That is how the two are related in the minds of most people and why Trump calling the virus a political hoax and holding a rally are equivalent to Trump calling the virus itself a hoax. 

If the president believed in the danger presented by the virus, do you believe that the president would have held a political rally? Why or why not? Remember, this was after after he had been briefed and warned about the danger of the situation well in advance. "

He was credited for saving the pharmacy from being shut down, so much so that they gave him loads of vouchers, and the supermarket next door gave him a 25% off gift card that had unlimited use for a month, as its a tight knit community, and he saved all the pharmacy’s jobs, about 10 people he kept employed. 

He gets a few prescription meds there, but there was one over the counter drug he gets regularly, as it really helps with the pain from one of the conditions.

Never been a problem. But last week i went to pick up the over the counter meds. My friend being immunocompromised is very high risk for the coronavirus, so he called ahead and said I would pick up the over the counter meds later for him as he cant leave his home. They said it was ok. When I arrived, there was a new girl there. The head pharmacist had left a note saying I was picking up the meds. She questioned me, didn’t mind, she was new and she was just doing her job. But she proceeded to give out to me saying I was not allowed to pick up over the counter meds for someone else, that she will no longer be selling meds to me or my friend. I don’t know where it came from. She did sell me that one pack though and said that was the last either of us were getting here and proceeded to marked my friend in the system to not sell drugs to. 

My friend called her boss, the one who left the note saying I was picking them up and tore into her, and assured us that wont happen again.

Normalcy Bias:

Stress slows information processing, and when the brain cannot find an  acceptable response to a situation, it fixates on a single and sometimes  default solution. This single resolution can result in unnecessary  injury or death in disaster situations. The lack of preparation for  disasters often leads to inadequate shelter, supplies, and evacuation  plans.   
Thus, normalcy bias can cause people to drastically underestimate  the effects of the disaster and assume that everything will be all  right.

In a year or so, we might have a viable vaccine, and we’ll probably administer that vaccine annually to help the herd immunity and prevent a pandemic from spreading. Vaccines are important! Get vaccinated! Everyone get your flu shots when it’s time this year.

From The Atlantic: 

“Second: duration of immunity. When people are infected by the milder human coronaviruses that cause cold-like symptoms, they remain immune for less than a year. By contrast, the few who were infected by the original SARS virus, which was far more severe, stayed immune for much longer. Assuming that SARS-CoV-2 lies somewhere in the middle, people who recover from their encounters might be protected for a couple of years. To confirm that, scientists will need to develop accurate serological tests, which look for the antibodies that confer immunity. They’ll also need to confirm that such antibodies actually stop people from catching or spreading the virus. If so, immune citizens can return to work, care for the vulnerable, and anchor the economy during bouts of social distancing.”

There’s a lot of great information here about what the next several years are probably going to look like for us:

You'll see that this latter link is a western source, since you're so brainwashed you only trust your own western chauvinist websites:

""At the Chinese companies we talked to, 89 percent of employees were African, adding up to nearly 300,000 jobs for African workers. Scaled up across all 10,000 Chinese firms in Africa, this suggests that Chinese-owned business employ several million Africans. Moreover, nearly two-thirds of Chinese employers provided some kind of skills training. In companies engaged in construction and manufacturing, where skilled labor is a necessity, half offer apprenticeship training.

Half of Chinese firms had introduced a new product or service to the local market, and one-third had introduced a new technology. In some cases, Chinese firms had lowered prices for existing products and services by as much as 40 percent through improved technology and efficiencies of scale. African government officials overseeing infrastructure development for their countries cited Chinese firms’ efficient cost structures and speedy delivery as major value adds.

On balance, we believe that China’s growing involvement is strongly positive for Africa’s economies, governments, and workers.""

new release or not, NO ONE wants to pay MORE than the price of a ticket to rent it at home. literally no one would feel like theyre getting a good deal, for countless reasons that would take 30 minutes to type out.

it takes me a whopping 5 minutes to go from having my computer off, to typing in ""black widow putlocker/123movies/google drive"" and voila, i have the film without paying a cent. does everyone know how to do this? course not. but even the people who want to see it, but wont pirate it?

theyre not gonna feel good about $20 to watch it on their phone with a shitty preset EQ that takes out all the low end...

at the same time, disney doesnt really have many choices. mark my words, those alive going through the coronavirus will be hesitant to go to the movies again, AND other places, when it releases.

just how older generations overfeed their grandchildren and keep rotting food because they went through shortages in WWII? people are gonna be MUCH more weary of going out and of becoming ill in public places from now on.

businesses are going to pretend everything is fine and try to get back to normal ASAP...LONG before it is safe to. people know that. the film will release...but that isnt gonna make people feel safe enough to go watch the film in the same numbers they would have if the virus hadn't happened.

disney's best bet is to wait as long as they can to release, and then allow the film to be rented digitally after TWO WEEKS. thats how theyll maximize profits.

if they released it digitally from the get go?

there is a very, very, VERY real chance that the movie could do HORRIBLY. this couldve been another billion dollar film. if they release digitally its possible they could only break even.

i think whatever route they go, they need new marketing with stark and any other characters and surprises theyve got to draw people in. they need to make all they can. we could very well be looking at the lowest grossing MCU film of all time."

2020-03-28,GnarlsMansion,army,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/army/comments/fqknas/cjtfoir_commander_pushes_back_against_potential/flqsp3f/,"Even so, American officials said there was no firm evidence that Iran ordered the attack by the militia group. But Mr. Pompeo and other senior officials in recent weeks have argued for aggressive military action not only against Kataib Hezbollah but also against Iranian military forces.
During a White House meeting on March 12, Mr. Esper and General Milley argued for a more limited response to the rocket attacks — a view that prevailed on Mr. Trump, who ordered nighttime raids on five suspected weapons depots in Iraq used by Kataib Hezbollah.

Several American officials said there was an increased urgency in planning attack options against Kataib Hezbollah as the group, perhaps along with other Shiite militias, has threatened to ramp up strikes against U.S. troops stationed on Iraqi bases after the celebrations for Nowruz, the Iranian New Year, end soon. American military intelligence agencies have detected signs that big attacks could be in the works, according to a senior U.S. military official who has been briefed on some of the contingency planning in Iraq.

Kataib Hezbollah, in a statement on Wednesday, warned its fighters to prepare for possible attacks from the United States, and threatened to retaliate against Americans and any Iraqis who help them. “We will respond with full force to all their military, security, and economic facilities,” said the statement, according to SITE, a private company that monitors jihadists’ websites and postings.

The immediate targets of a Pentagon campaign against Kataib Hezbollah most likely would be the group’s leadership, bases and weapons depots, Mr. Knights said. In addition to a vast array of rockets, the group is believed to have access to a hidden arsenal of short-range ballistic missiles funneled into Iraq by Iran over the past several months, according to American intelligence and military officials.

An extended campaign could hit militia targets across a wide swath of Iraq and Syria, and possibly other Shiite militias in Iraq that are loosely aligned with Kataib Hezbollah. “You can’t just hit rank-and-file fighters, you’d have to hit leadership, most of whom have probably dispersed,” Mr. Knights said.

At the same time, American officials said the risks laid out in General White’s memo are genuine, and some military planners believe it would be foolish for the Trump administration to escalate military operations inside Iraq anytime soon.
More than 5,000 American troops are currently stationed in Iraq, most of them part of the mission to train and advise Iraqi security forces in the mission against the Islamic State. Pentagon officials had been seeking to reduce that presence to about 2,500 troops in the coming months.

Any campaign against Kataib Hezbollah is likely to draw from the roughly 70,000 American military personnel currently deployed around the Middle East, including in Saudi Arabia and other Persian Gulf nations. More than 14,000 of those troops have moved into the region since last May amid rising tensions with Iran.

The Pentagon has also sent Patriot air and missile defense batteries, B-52 bombers, a carrier strike group, armed Reaper drones and other engineering and support personnel.

Commanders are still rushing more Patriot antimissile batteries and other weaponry into Iraq, but are still a week or two away from having the additional defensive systems in place there, a senior U.S. military official said.

In recent weeks, as the threat from militia attacks and exposure to the coronavirus has increased, the United States and its European allies have been turning over smaller coalition bases to their Iraqi counterparts, and either moving to a handful of larger Iraqi bases or leaving the country altogether.

Speaking to reporters the day after the United States hit the five Khatib Hezbollah weapons depots this month, Gen. Kenneth F. McKenzie Jr., the head of Central Command, said that the threat from Iran and its proxies remained “very high” and added that tensions “have actually not gone down” since the United States killed General Suleimani.

While American officials say they have no clear evidence that Iran specifically directed the deadly attack on Camp Taji on March 11, they say that Kataib Hezbollah and the Iranian Quds Force coordinate closely.
General McKenzie said the United States was poised to strike additional militia weapons storage sites and other targets should attacks against American forces continue. He blamed Kataib Hezbollah for about a dozen rocket attacks against American troops based in Iraq in the past six months.

Mr. Esper suggested on Wednesday that the United States could respond further to the militia’s rocket attacks, but offered no details.

“You don’t get to kill or wound Americans and get away with it,” Mr. Esper said in an interview with NPR. “We will respond at the time, place and manner of our choosing. We will hold them accountable.”

What’s worse, there's presidential election in May 2020 and at 3 am Saturday 28.03.2020 Poland’s parliament passed a law allowing postal voting for senior citizens and those in quarantine or self-isolating. According to many lawyers such a law is illegal and unconstitutional.

1. Unconstitutionality in relation to the Constitutional tribunal rulings that such changes cannot be made up to 6 months before any election.
1. Uneven access to voting. Every citizen needs to vote the same way if he is 18+.
1. “Fill Grandma’s election card”.
1. Election card thrown in the postal box after 2:00 am the next day

Not to mention that there will be no debates, there will be no campaigns, Andrzej Duda will be on the shown from morning to night in the government media in the upcoming months. Nobody will go out protesting because many people are scared of the coronavirus. Many young people won’t vote because they will be afraid to catch the virus.

This is because during a pandemic not all patients are being tested, so you have deaths which occur that do not get counted in the official statistics. You also have deaths which would not have occurred had hospital resources not been at their limits, or which were hastened by infection but ultimately had other core causes: so they get counted as that. Only when it is over, and you can look at the total number of deaths it he preceding period, compared to the pandemic period, can you get a final count. Some towns in Italy are already reporting this anecdotally – that they are having many more deaths reported than in the previous period, which far exceed the official Corona death counts – and we'll have to wait on more official numbers to come through in the future."

> A: **The big mistake in the U.S. and Europe, in my opinion, is that people aren’t wearing masks.** This virus is transmitted by droplets and close contact. Droplets play a very important role—you’ve got to wear a mask, because when you speak, there are always droplets coming out of your mouth. Many people have asymptomatic or presymptomatic infections. If they are wearing face masks, it can prevent droplets that carry the virus from escaping and infecting others."

I guess Switzerland could have done more to prevent the current situation before it even started, but if you look at northern Italy, how close we are and how fast all of that happened, maybe not. So given the situation not in the past, but the situation we have right now, I think Switzerland is doing a pretty decent job. You have to keep in mind that this is not only a medical problem, it's also an economic catastrophe.

I don't closely follow how other countries handle the situation, but in some countries the government tells people that they should stay home, but most people ignore that because you know what? People have to pay rent, they have to eat. So they go to work. People in Switzerland who can't go to work right now because of the coronavirus don't get fired, because the companies they work for get money from the government so they can pay their employees even though they're not working.

The government has also mobilised the military, organises repatriation flights around the world, keeps stores stocked, and different from other countries we haven't run out of medical supplies, beds or medical staff yet. I think it's not fair to compare Switzerland to Taiwan or the US or whatever, and I also don't think it's fair to compare a country with 8.5 million people to countries with tens or hundreds of millions of people. Compare it to northern Italy. I think Switzerland does everything as right as possible in a situation where there are a lot of hard decisions to make."

Now bear in mind, this is from my own personal experience, and what works for me will not work for everyone. But I can attest that these steps essentially took my health anxiety level from daily panic attacks, constant focusing on how hard it is to breath, believing I had random illnesses (heart condition, throat cancer, schizophrenia, lung cancer, COPD to name a few I genuinely spent weeks believing I had), to now being at the point where yes, all this coronavirus stuff is stressing me, but I recognise my anxiety and can very quickly bring myself away from it:)


If you want a health anxiety cure, this is as close as I believe we are to one. I 100% recommend you follow these recommendations, and I basically guarantee you will feel more comfortable and powerful in anxious moments than you ever have before:)

**Step 1**

STOP READING THE NEWS/CORONAVIRUS REDDIT POSTS

Just stop it. Every story is a trigger, even positive stories have set me off. I've seen too many posts on even /r/COVID19_support, which is supposedly meant to help anxiety sufferers, trigger my health anxiety. Don't look up symptoms, figures, anything about this bloody thing. Unsub the subreddits, even including this one. This is the first step to taking your brain away from your anxiety.

If you want to believe you have brain cancer, start reading about brain cancer symptoms, and your anxiety will give you them. I've had so many phantom symptoms over these last years it's ridiculous. This virus is no different. Obviously you will know most of the symptoms by now, but don't look up anything more than you already know. The other steps will help you when you get these phantom symptoms.

**Step 2**

IF YOU HAVEN'T ALREADY, LEARN ABOUT ANXIETY

Anxiety is our minds way of looking after us: but for us, our brains are very overprotective, like an overly loyal chihuahua barking at every noise. This means that whenever we get any slight symptom that most people would not even consciously notice, our brains zoom in and focus on nothing but that symptom. ""Huh, I needed to clear my throat. Do I usually need to clear my throat? I need to cough again, OH GOD what if THIS is what the start is like!! Oh no and now I'm getting hot and etc etc etc."" I'm sure you've experienced something like this before, and before you know it you're unable to focus on anything except the thought of your impending doom.

Your brain is trying to protect you: when we focus on these symptoms, our brain wants us to notice them so that we can look after them. But, it's not like being chased by a lion: we can't even run away, we are simply stuck with these phantom symptoms falling into an anxious loop. Once this happens a few times, we are stuck in the cycle, and there you go: you have health anxiety. Step 3 will teach you how to stop this anxious loop.

**Step 3**

THE DARE RESPONSE

Anxiety WILL NOT HURT YOU. Anxiety only causes anxiety - there is no PHYSICAL risk from it, only the risk of worsening anxiety, which we are already in, so there's no point worrying about that! Remember this as we go through this response: no matter how bad your anxiety feels, you will not be hurt:)

This response will teach you how to be comfortable in your anxiety, and will diffuse any anxious cycle or thought loop:) after some practice, you can use this response practically subconsciously, and for me, it practically cured my health anxiety. It's called the DARE Response (the full book that I used to stop my anxiety is called DARE by Barry McDonnagh. If you find this comment interesting/helpful, go and buy it, this man is my hero:))

***D - Defuse***

This is the first step in DARE. Whenever we first notice that we feel anxiety rising, or an anxious response to a symptom, we want to instantly respond. Now, often anxiety attacks are caused by some form of a ""what if"" question, ie ""what if I have coronavirus?"". To respond to this, I reply in my brain with a ""So what?"" or, my personal preference, ""Who gives a fuck?"". So for the coronavirus example, I say to myself (either in your head or out loud) ""Who gives a fuck? If I've got it I've got it, my body is fully capable of fighting this off."" This instantly makes you feel powerful - you're no longer giving into an anxious thought loop. When I believed I had a heart condition, I'd suddenly think ""shit my heart skipped a beat and my chest hurts, what if I have a cardiac arrest?"". I taught myself to respond with ""So what? My heart is bloody strong and this is nothing more than a light workout for it.""

One of the most common thoughts is ""What if I die?"". For me, I simply answer ""Whatever. I don't remember before I was born, I wont remember after. If it's time to go it's time to go.""

Now this will take practice, it's hard to be so blase around your anxiety at first, but it will come:)

*REMEMBER: D - Defuse: ""Who gives a fuck?""*

***A: Allow it***

This step is all about accepting your anxiety. Fighting anxious thoughts tends to make them worse - if you flow with it, accept that you're anxious and learn to feel comfortable with that, you will become more powerful than you can possibly imagine.

So to do this, once we've Defused our anxious thought, we then say (again in your head or out loud), ""I accept and allow this anxious thought. I accept and allow this anxious feeling.""

Accept your symptom for what it is: nervous arousal. Allow that feeling to be there - remember, it CANNOT HURT YOU. This will teach you to be, and I quote, ""be comfortable in your anxious discomfort.""

Don't try to run away from anxious feelings: that will make it worse. Observe, accept and allow it. ""Oh, my breathing is shallow. What if this is coronavirus?"" ""So what? Coronavirus is nothing compared to what I could fight off. I accept and allow this anxious feeling of breathlessness. I can still breathe can't I? So what if I feel short of breath, I've felt it before and always been fine. Come on in anxiety, stay a while.""

Of course, this feels counter intuitive. ""Why would I want to accept my anxious feelings? That's what I'm trying to get rid of!!"" But trust me, allowing those anxious feelings and thoughts to exist, letting them sit with you, and simply passively observing them is an incredibly powerful way to let your brain know that these thoughts and feelings ARE NOT A THREAT. Eventually, you rewire your brain to make it realise this permanently:) don't be fearful of fear - accept it, allow it, move with it.

Even on days when you aren't anxious, bloody invite the bastard in! ""Go on then anxiety, you'll do it at some point, so come on in now why don't you!"" You'll suddenly find that it won't - inviting your anxiety to exist is a surefire way to not have it exist. ""Oh don't feel like it today? Come on, show me what you've got!!""

So, don't resist your anxious thoughts and feelings. Accept them, allow them, sit with them and they will diminish very rapidly.

*REMEMBER: A - Allow it. ""I accept and allow these anxious thoughts and feeling.""*

***R - Run towards***

If you still feel anxious after the first two steps, this one takes it even further. Now remember, anxiety is nothing more than nervous energy through your body, it cannot hurt you: this step is about telling yourself that you're not anxious, you're EXCITED to have these feelings. Anxiety and excitement are two sides of the same coin, the same feelings, the same surge of adrenaline. We can change our interpretation of anxiety into excitement - such as the feeling of going on a rollercoaster.

Tell yourself, ""I'm excited by this feeling. In fact, make it stronger! Make my heart pound harder, give it your best fucking shot anxiety, I literally want to be pounding 200bpm!"" You'll again find that nothing will happen, and your symptom will diminish. Disappointing effort anxiety.

Now as asthmatics, a lot of our symptoms are to do with shortness of breath (for me at least). So I would think, ""Huh, I'm short of breath. What if I get so short of breath that I can't get enough oxygen?"". With our steps so far, I would then reply ""So fucking what. My asthma meds have worked every other time, they'd work now. I can always get a nebuliser anyway, nice try anxiety. But that's okay, I accept and allow this shortness of breath. I know this symptom, I can now observe it and simply allow it to be. I'm excited by this feeling. In fact, try harder, this is pathetic. Go on, reeeeally constrict my throat. Tight as you can. No? Ah well. Guess I'll just keep breathing then.""

With practice, using these 3 steps I was able to stop any panic attack in it's tracks. Learn them, use them every single time, and within weeks you'll laugh at yourself for ever being anxious over a slight cough.

*REMEMBER: R - Run towards. ""I'm excited by this feeling. Try harder anxiety!""

***E - Engage***

Once you've implemented the 3 previous steps, the final one is to engage in some form of other, mentally occupying activity. Reading, gaming, knitting, call somebody to chat, whatever you can do that will fully occupy your attention. This will allow you to be engaged away from falling back into your anxious loop.

DON'T BE IDLE. Idleness here will cause you to 'check in' on your anxiety, which will often lead you to having to start the process all over again. Occupy your mind, and before you know it you'll be wondering how you got so wound up earlier.

*REMEMBER: E - Engage. Occupy your mind with an activity.*

There will need to be thorough documentation to prove that the deficiency was unavoidable due to the virus, and if it was not, there will be civil penalties and criminal enforcement as usual.

it certainly true with the flu where you can develop long-lasting immunity, but you don't develop long lasting immunity to this virus you only develop short-lived immunity.

We're still probably coming to terms with the fact that you may only be immune for 6 months. If we're lucky you'll be immune for 2 years anything beyond that is More like extreme wishful thinking.

That's not to say the difference between 6 months and 2 years wouldn't be huge, It's just to point out that the flu antibodies last the entire lifetime and antibodies for current environments usually last 3-6 months."

> SINGAPORE - Mr Hugh Mason realised on Monday (March 23) that he had lost his sense of smell.

> ""My wife was peeling an orange and I thought, that's weird, I can't smell it ,"" the 53-year-old told The Straits Times on Saturday.

> Mr Mason, an adjunct associate professor at the National University of Singapore's Faculty of Engineering, said that he had read reports online that Covid-19 could be associated with a loss of smell in certain cases.

> So he consulted his doctor, who sent him to be tested for the coronavirus on Thursday.

> Mr Mason then returned home and self-isolated while waiting for the results. The next day, he received a call asking him to return for further tests.

> These came back positive and he was warded for Covid-19 at SGH on Friday.

> Mr Mason said that he had already come down with a cold around March 10 that had turned into fever by March 22.

> His 50-year-old wife also tested positive for the virus on Saturday and is isolated at the National Centre for Infectious Diseases.

> Their 13-year-old son is currently self-isolating at home with the family's domestic helper.

> ""He's fine, he'll probably be playing video games at home all day now that there's no one to stop him,"" said Mr Mason with a laugh.

> He added that he did not know where he might have caught the virus.

> Related Story Coronavirus cases in Singapore: What we know so far

> ""The last time I was out of the country was Jan 21. That's a long time ago, so I don't think I brought it back from the United Kingdom with me,"" said Mr Mason, a UK citizen, who has been a permanent resident here since 2013.

> Despite a daunting isolation period ahead of him and a lengthy separation from his loved ones, Mr Mason is grateful for many things.

> He said: ""There's enormous politicisation (of this healthcare crisis) in the UK. I realise there is scarcity (of medical resources) because of appallingly bad management, there's scarcity and fear, and it brings out the worst in people.

> ""(In Singapore) we still have scarce resources, but they're being used very, very wisely. That means help is available for people who need it when they need it. I feel extremely lucky to be here.""

> He added: ""It's been a very reflective time for me, being alone. I feel incredibly grateful... I realise that my family and other families here are being looked after by this system and it's taking care of our lives.

> ""I want to smell the air, that green smell, again...It's very odd to be in a room that I can't leave, but I know that this is what's keeping us all safe,"" he said.

> In the meantime, he has been keeping busy chatting with friends, writing and doing research for a business he is planning to start.

> Mr Mason said that his sense of smell has yet to return, but his condition has otherwise improved, leaving him with just a mild cough.

> He said: ""There is some uncertainty, but I know I couldn't be in a better place.""

Measures to control the coronavirus have as a side-effect that fewer pollutants are emitted. An analysis of satellite measurements from 2019 and 2020 estimates that the measures have led to a decrease of between 20 and 60% in concentrations above the Netherlands. This reduction in air pollution can be observed from space using the Dutch satellite instrument Tropomi.

**Reduced emissions in the Netherlands**  
In our country, measures have been taken to control the coronavirus since 16 March. These measures have led to a sharp reduction in, for example, road traffic, air traffic and industrial activities. As a result, there is temporarily less emission of harmful substances, such as carbon dioxide and nitrogen dioxide. 

Last week, starting Sunday 22 March, was exceptionally sunny and dry, with a southeastern wind blowing through a large high-pressure area to the north of the Netherlands. The satellite cannot see through clouds, but the sunny weather made it possible to take extra measurements this week. To minimize the influence of the weather on the equation, we compared 22-26 March 2020 with the period 23-27 February 2019 when it was also largely cloudless in northwestern Europe with also a wind from the southeast. This comparison can be seen in Figure 1.  

**Combining data** 
NO2 concentrations vary greatly from day to day, mainly due to changes in the weather but also, for example, due to changes in emissions. Emissions in the Netherlands, for example, are much lower on Sundays than during the week. It is therefore difficult to draw conclusions on the basis of one day's measurements. By averaging the data over time, we lose some of this variability. We have combined the data over different periods and compared them with the period for these measures and with the monthly average of March 2019.

The estimation of the reduction depends on how exactly the comparison is done and which period is chosen for the averaging. Therefore, the estimate based on these measurements alone is relatively uncertain for the Netherlands, with a margin of 20 to 60 percent.

Satellite measurements have been carried out by the OMI instrument, Tropomi's predecessor, for sixteen years. Comparison with these historical data shows how exceptional the current situation is.

**China and Europe**  
Earlier a strong decrease in air pollution above China and northern Italy was already measured. This has also been observed in Paris, Rome and Madrid. Similar decreases were recently reported by the European Environment Agency for cities in Europe based on ground measurements of NO2.

**Next Step**  
The next step is to combine satellite measurements of NO2 concentrations with measurements on the ground and with models describing atmospheric chemistry and meteorological variability. This combination will allow us to better quantify the meteorological influence and make more precise estimates of the changes in emissions.

I know one will be a hurricane of incompetent, selfish fuckery and the other will be a panacea in which everything tries to go back to the ""normal"", in which people quietly get fucked behind the scenes.

But, see, I think the long-lasting effects of a band-aid presidency will actually be worse in the long term, because people will be able to close their eyes and pretend everything is fine. Another four years of Trump and they CAN'T. I'd rather take a gut punch to the stomach now if it means people really want to change the country in four years, than let themselves slowly be bled dry for the next few decades.

By the way, it isn't going to matter because if the Democrats nominate Biden, he will lose. Remember 2016? 2004? Remember running a centrist moderate against Trump? Remember losing? Remember that the only time Democrats won was when a relative outsider people really cared about was the nominee? WHY ARE Y'ALL HAPPILY MAKING THE SAME MISTAKE AGAIN???

Biden is not electable. The electability argument is a lie.

No. My state still has a primary and is sending out ballots to everyone by mail. I'm voting for the man who stood up in front of the Senate and specifically argued to make sure that gig workers - which I am - are included in the stimulus bill. The man who *directly* made sure I'd be eligible for unemployment for the first time so I won't be thrown out of my apartment. The man who raised millions for Coronavirus charities. The man who has been working his ass off for us since day one, decades ago.

Not the guy who hid for over a week and is currently doing fuck and all. A real front-runner with nothing else to do should be LOUDLY pushing Trump to act. Showing up on every channel to state what Trump should be doing to help people and making sure people understand how unacceptable his actions are, *specifically*  to force Trump to do what needs to happen in order to retain his ratings.

You also said there isn't savings. Did Americans save more before keynesianism swept the nation?

Would you believe that interest rates are subject to market dynamics and how people save, or invest, are both shaped by AND also shape interest rates? 

Is this stimulus a printing of more money? If it is, then I can see the concern, but the way money moves, gets reinvested (saved?) is different than we've seen in other economies where the stimulus is a 'print job!'

2020-03-28,Duese,AskThe_Donald,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskThe_Donald/comments/fqafvm/the_top_10_lies_about_president_trumps_response/flquw6i/,"> The US was the first to reach 100k confirmed cases, even though our first confirmed case was after others’. By comparison to, say, South Korea (whose first case came a week before ours), our response has been slow and confused. 

Congrats, you have bought into the media narrative which is literally what Trump was talking about when he was references the democrat hoax.  

First off, go read the rest of Trump's speech that you DIDN'T quote.  We're 4 years into this bullshit and people like you still don't realize you don't get all of the information or you will choose not to get all of the information.  So, go read the whole speech and then you can come back here and talk about Trump's comments.

Secondly, the biggest part of the media narrative that is happening right now is treating the infections just as bad as the deaths.  This isn't a game and you need to start taking this seriously.  We could (and probably do) have over a million people infected right now but the actual number of infections doesn't matter.  The idea that testing is the problem is the pinnacle of lies that you don't care about being rational about.  

Let's say that every single person in the US gets tested magically and because we're doing this magically it doesn't completely overwhelm our health systems.  What happens next?  What do we tell all the people who are infected right now and are showing mild or moderate symptoms which consists of 85% of all infections?  We tell them to self quarantine at home, to drink lots of fluids and to distance themselves from anyone else.  Hold on a second, isn't that what people are being told to do RIGHT NOW regardless of if they are infected?  It's almost like whether or not we are tested, we would be doing the same thing.  Now, in the real world we don't have magic so for us to test every single person in the US would just completely overwhelm our health care facilities.  Great job!  You've now wasted everyone's time and you gain nothing out of it.

>We were supposedly the country best prepared to handle an epidemic as of last year. And yet, we aren’t on top of this; it’s still getting exponentially worse.

The mortality rate in the US is one of the best in the world.  We're testing more people each day who are actually showing symptoms than any other country.  We've provided more funding to dealing with this virus than any other country.  We have the most capabilities to deal with even large scale hospitalizations.

Start realizing that this is a highly contagious virus.  Let me restate that one more time, this is a highly contagious virus.  It's going to spread just like it's spreading in every single country in the world.  But please, pretend that the federal government can prevent a virus from spreading because that's completely rational.  State and federal governments can impact the spread of the virus but they can't defy the laws of physics and prevent it completely.

Right now if you look at the infections in the US, what do you see?  You see 44% of all of the infections are in New York.  Every other state by comparison averages ~1,100 infections.  Why do you think that is?  Well, let's look at the facts.  When other states and governors were shutting down schools, cancelling social events, imposing restrictions, what was Coumo doing?  He was telling people to each Chinese food and not to be racist.  Honestly, it doesn't matter what he was doing only what he wasn't doing and that resulted in having FIVE TIMES as many deaths as any other state.  Again, the number of infections doesn't matter.  The number of tests doesn't matter.  What matters is the people who don't recover, who get infected because of inaction, who weren't prepared locally.  

>So claiming that someone who criticizes the federal response is perpetrating a “hoax” is as misleading as claiming the president called coronavirus itself a hoax.

Read his speech and like I said earlier, read the whole thing not just the part which gets told to you by the media.  When you realize that the rather important part of his speech where he literally talks about how he was taking action when others weren't really demolishes any idea that he was calling the virus itself a hoax.  So, when you realize that then start asking the question of what else you were lied to about and you had misrepresented.  When you start looking at ALL the facts and start forming rational responses based on the data, you start realizing just how terrible the media is right now.

Your post is actually pretty emblematic of the problem.  The OP lists 10 different major lies that were perpetuated by the media and you addressed 2 of them.  Regardless of if those 2 had actual arguments, the fact that you willingly ignore the 8 other items and then still continue to support the media that is perpetuating these lies says everything.  The idea that you can ignore anything you don't like or don't have an answer for is your failure.  You need to do better.  You need to take everything in, not just the things that support your narrative."

You know that, right? Coronavirus. They’re politicizing it. We did one of the great jobs. You say, ‘How’s President Trump doing?’ They go, ‘Oh, not good, not good.’ They have no clue. They don’t have any clue. They can’t even count their votes in Iowa, they can’t even count. No they can’t. They can’t count their votes.
One of my people came up to me and said, ‘Mr. President, they tried to beat you on Russia, Russia, Russia. That didn’t work out too well. They couldn’t do it. They tried the impeachment hoax. That was on a perfect conversation. They tried anything, they tried it over and over, they’ve been doing it since you got in. It’s all turning, they lost, it’s all turning. Think of it. Think of it. And this is their new hoax. But you know, we did something that’s been pretty amazing. We’re 15 people [cases of coronavirus infection] in this massive country. And because of the fact that we went early, we went early, we could have had a lot more than that.

>It's insane that you think Trump following what WHO is saying is praise.

It literally says that in every article I posted. But you know, when the media says somethinh positive about Trump, it's best to ignore that and call me a liar...

>Trump made 33 false claims about corona during the first 2 weeks of MARCH, he still doesn't know what he is going on, and we've been aware of this comming pandemic since November 2019, at which point you'all in this sub were calling it a flu. https://www.google.com/amp/s/amp.cnn.com/cnn/2020/03/22/politics/fact-check-trump-coronavirus-false-claims-march/index.html

Your claim was that his advisors are constantly correcting him... You have yet to show any evidence of that. Like I said, not a single advisor to Trump has ""corrected"" anything he has said.
Nice attempt to distract from what you actually claimed, though.

>3 trillion for companies which they don't need to disclose how they spend until half a year later?

How do companies get $3T when the bill is only $2T?
Sounds like someone is making up facts to fit thier narrative... 

>How long will you guys let Americans suffer so Trump can get richer

He's not getting ""richer"". This bill doesn't benefit him at all.

And while we're casting stones, let's not forget all the bullshit that has nothing to do with COVID, that Pelosi tried to sneak into the bill. She's the reason it's delayed. It would have been passed already if they didn't have to go back and remove all of her crap.. But I'm sure in your limited brain capacity, that's somehow Trumps fault too."

She said, Pharma companies are facing problem in movement of stock and manpower which may hamper production and supply of medicines and medical devices.

In Mizoram, state govt has taken all measures to ensure that the essential commodities, foodstuff under PDS and vegetables will be made available to the people during the 21-day lock down period. While stating this, Chief Minister Zoramthanga yesterday said, this will be undertaken by the Local Task Force, by reaching out to every family.
The Chief Minister Zoramthanga assured that the Supply Committee formed under the State Level Task Force on COVID 19 will see that vegetables and other crops in the state are being harvested and also distributed safely among the people during the total lockdown period.
He said systematic distribution system is already chalked out with the help of Local Task Force. He has also thanked the volunteers of the local task force in becoming the backbone for management of citizens during the time of crisis.
Chief Minister also assured of safety to Mizo people locked- on outside the state. He said, Lok Sabha MP C Lalrosanga and Rajya Sabha MP Ronald Sapa Tlau have been monitoring the situation.
 Maharashtra Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray has announced that Shops selling essential commodities will be allowed to stay open 24 hours of the day.
The Chief Minister's Office statement said that the decision was taken to prevent crowding at shops and marketplaces amid the lockdown to contain the coronavirus pandemic.
It said that Thackeray held discussions with senior officials who are in charge of special control room for coronavirus set up at the Mantralaya or the state secretariat about how to ensure smooth supply of essential goods earlier in the day. With 5 deaths and 125 coronavirus cases, Maharashtra is, highest in the country in COVID-19 outbreak. 
 
In Tamil Nadu, nine different committees have been formed with senior IAS officers to address concerns over the movement and availability of essential goods to all during the curfew period. A decision on this has arrived after a marathon review meeting held by the state Chief Minister Edappadi Palaniswamy with district collectors and superintendents of police via video-conferencing. Later, the administration issued a statement in Chennai saying, in all district headquarters, a help centre would be established to ensure the movement of essential goods to all places. Section 144, initially promulgated till the end of this month is being extended up to 14th April when the curfew ends.
Private lenders have been directed not to insist on payment of interest and principal for the loans they have given to the poor until further orders due to their job loss. The lenders have been warned of dire consequences if they violate the directive.
District officials have been asked to give identity cards to people other than government servants who are involved in the movement of essential goods.
Besides e-commerce agencies, small retail outlets are also allowed to make door delivery of dry groceries and vegetables.
The list of about 54-thousand people who came from abroad recently has been shared with all district collectors. They have been asked to ensure their proper quarantine.
AIR correspondent reports that the Government Multi-Super Speciality Hospital in Chennai has been converted into a 350-beded facility exclusively for Covid-19 treatment. Isolation wards, step-down wards and medical and paramedical teams are put in place. In Chennai alone, there are over 20-thousand homes that are declared quarantined. However, the city Corporation Commissioner has appealed to public that they should not be considered as people with patients. He has clarified that the action is only a precautionary measure. He has appealed to the public having vacant homes or lodges to give them temporarily to the civic body to augment the isolation and quarantine facilities in the city. Meanwhile, a third private diagnostic centre has been approved by the Indian Council for Medical Research in Chennai.
In Himachal Pradesh, statewide curfew has been relaxed for six hours daily for the public to make essential purchases. Chief Minister Jairam Thakur urged the people to come out of their homes only in the emergency situation as the curfew have been enforced for their safety.
In the wake of COVID-19 pandemic, the state government has decided to extend the closure of all the offices of the state government till 31 March except those notified by the state government as essential services.
In order to facilitate people for their daily needs curfew has been relaxed from 7:00 am to 1:00 pm daily across the state. The relaxation in curfew is only to facilitate people to buy their essential commodities not for commuting from one place to another un-necessarily. Only one family member has been allowed to go out for purchasing during the relaxation period. Chief MinisterJairam Thakur directed the District Commissioners’ to explore the possibility of home delivery through major departmental stores of urban areas which would be helpful in observing social distancing. Jairam Thakur also urged the people of the State to buy essential commodities from groceries nearer to their homes as it would be helpful in breaking the COVID-19 chain. 
Meghalaya Chief Minister Conrad K Sangma has said that there is no reason for panic buying as supply of essential commodities will be made available across the State during lockdown period. The statement comes after certain parts of the State witnessed panic buying when some relaxation was given for public to buy essential food items.
Chief Minister's Office said that purpose of social distancing and lockdown will be defeated if people do not follow the directives of the Government and District Administration, who have been working tirelessly to ensure that essential items and services of the Government is made available to the people.
The Chief Minister informed that essential food items will be made available to the public by the administration in different localities."

Given that those are the ones likely underestimating the death tolls, 10x isn't an ""even if"", it's a  ""if we're lucky"". Conversely, some estimates place the death rate at 18%.

To put actual numbers out there ([Source Link](https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/)):


*Best Case: ~10x mortality rate of flu*

29,971 deaths / (645,606 Total Reported Cases * 5 (Representing Trump's statement that 80% of all cases go unreported, so the true number of cases would be 5x larger)) = .928% mortality rate per infection

[2018-2019 season flu for comparison](https://www.cdc.gov/flu/about/burden/2018-2019.html):

34200/35.5million=.0963% mortality rate per infection

*Worst Case: ~177x mortality rate of flu*

29,971 deaths / 169,523 closed cases (Deaths + Recovered) = 17.68%


*Summary:*

Suffice it to say, not only does the most optimistic report put it at 10x worse than the flu, that's also basing that estimate off of unresolved infections vs resolved deaths. Suffice it to say, the WHO estimate of a death rate of 3-4% (30-40x that of the flu) does not look exaggerated. In Truth, I'd peg the most realistic best case scenario as having a 2% death rate (so 20x the death rate of the flu)."

Oregon Senator Jeff Merkley describes several benefits of the stimulus bill that was signed into law yesterday. These bullet points might apply to you:

For students pursing a higher education: 

* **If you have federal student loans,** your monthly federal student loan payments will be suspended until September. During this time, no additional interest will accrue. This is a critical step to provide badly needed economic relief for millions of borrowers.
*  **If you participate in a federal work study program,** but that work has been disrupted by the coronavirus, you will still receive your payments.
*  **If you drop out of school because of the coronavirus,** this academic term won’t count toward your lifetime subsidized loan eligibility or Pell Grant eligibility.
* **If you drop out of school because of the coronavirus,** your grades will not affect your grant or student loan eligibility. You are also not required to return unused Pell funding or federal student loans should you drop out of school because of the coronavirus.
* **If you are a TEACH Grant recipient** and you are unable to complete a full year of teaching because of the coronavirus, your partial year of service will count as a full year for your TEACH Grant obligations or Teacher Loan Forgiveness.

Q: I just lost my job. What kind of help can I get?

Once you're on unemployment insurance in your state, you will be eligible for an extra $600 per week in emergency federal compensation through July 31, 2020. That's in addition to what you'll receive in state benefits.

Q: Do I get that $600 if I was already getting unemployment before the outbreak?

Yes.

Gov. Jim Justice has been a maverick in some ways. He sided with teachers on pay raises and health insurance. He also has been against sanctuary cities and against gun control. His handling of the coronavirus has summarized into Saturday night nightmare of a speech. You could also credit him for shutting down schools before there was a single confirmed case in the state, unlike other states that are still open even with over 50 cases. 

Time will tell if I vote for him in the primary. The Democrats have Stephen Smith as their frontrunner. I do not subscribe yet I do not think to have any realistic chance in passing the state legislature, especially if Republicans control either chamber let alone both.  Ben Salango and Ron Stollings both seem to be traditional moderate West Virginia Democrats. They both could beat Gov. Justice, especially the statewide address a week ago. I said this because everybody tuned into it. It had more attention for a West Virginia governor for a long time. Smith will have a harder time because of his progressive policies in a year when President Trump is back on the ballot in a state that voted for him with 68.5%."

The ""regular"" flu infects 45 million and kills 61k in the USA alone every season. Since the regular flu season runs from about October through April that means 8,714 people die from the \*regular flu\* every month of the flu season.

As of right now we have a mere 116,448 confirmed Covid cases in the United States, which are heavily skewed towards only counting those who exhibit the most severe symptoms since we make it so difficult to get tested. That refusal to test makes the 1,943k deaths seem outsized, but is still \*less than a quarter\* of the normal monthly death count of the regular flu.

So I borrow the shares from you for a week, and pay you $100. As long as you weren't gonna sell during that week, you're back to where you started, plus $100 at the end. 

Lots of people (including me) aren't too bothered about short term dips in the market. Even this chaos right now doesn't bother me - they'll recover in a year, or two, or whenever. I don't need the cash, so I'm in no rush. In this case, if someone wanted to pay me to borrow some shares before this all happened, I'd be fine with it (not actually, but you know what I mean). 

It's always a gamble. If everyone knows the stock prices are gonna fall, then everyone's already selling. Shorting only makes sense if you can beat the odds. 

To tack on something else - stock prices are already based on what everyone knows, or thinks they know. Once this crisis starts to end, everyone's gonna be rushing to buy stuff at the lowest price, boosting the prices because everyone thinks they'll rise. The market was pricing in the public's thoughts on Coronavirus for a while, it's just that the public wasn't particularly concerned about it."

They found that it was still detectable on copper for up to four hours, on cardboard for up to 24 hours, and on plastic and steel for up to 72 hours.

But it’s important to note that the amount of virus decreased rapidly over time on each of those surfaces. And so the risk of infection from touching them would probably decrease over time as well.

Adrenochrome is made at the same lab as coronavirus? Whoever works with adrenochrome most likely was exposed to coronavirus which would potentially then spread to those distributing the adrenochdome, and then spread to the users aka the celebrities, politicians, etc. 

Might be more likely than some sort of targeted move to adrenchrome users. Just my 2 cents"

Our testing process is very slow and inaccurate. It takes 12-14 days from the moment they take a swab to the moment they get the results back. For context(I was told) wuhans test period only takes 4 hours or the sample has to be frozen. We’ve had a death where they are certain it’s coronavirus but the test that came back days later said negative so they can’t actually report it. 

Right now they are considering reporting presumptive cases as confirmed since some people are still moving about like the virus isn’t here.

January 22: “We have it totally under control. It's one person coming in from China. It's going to be just fine.”

February 2: “We pretty much shut it down coming in from China.”

February 24: “The Coronavirus is very much under control in the USA… Stock Market starting to look very good to me!”

February 25: “CDC and my Administration are doing a GREAT job of handling Coronavirus.”

February 25: “I think that's a problem that's going to go away… They have studied it. They know very much. In fact, we're very close to a vaccine.”

February 26: “The 15 (cases in the US) within a couple of days is going to be down to close to zero.”

February 26: “We're going very substantially down, not up.”

February 27: “One day it's like a miracle, it will disappear.”

February 28: ""Now the democrats are politicizing the coronavirus, you know that right? They're politicizing it…they have no clue…they dont have any clue…this is their new hoax.""

February 28: “We're ordering a lot of supplies. We're ordering a lot of, uh, elements that frankly we wouldn't be ordering unless it was something like this. But we're ordering a lot of different elements of medical.”

March 2: “You take a solid flu vaccine, you don't think that could have an impact, or much of an impact, on corona?”

March 2: “A lot of things are happening, a lot of very exciting things are happening and they're happening very rapidly.”

March 4: “If we have thousands or hundreds of thousands of people that get better just by, you know, sitting around and even going to work — some of them go to work, but they get better.”

March 5: “I NEVER said people that are feeling sick should go to work.”

March 5: “The United States… has, as of now, only 129 cases… and 11 deaths. We are working very hard to keep these numbers as low as possible!”

March 6: “I think we're doing a really good job in this country at keeping it down… a tremendous job at keeping it down.”

March 6: “Anybody right now, and yesterday, anybody that needs a test gets a test. They're there. And the tests are beautiful…. the tests are all perfect like the letter was perfect. The transcription was perfect. Right? This was not as perfect as that but pretty good.”

March 6: “I like this stuff. I really get it. People are surprised that I understand it… Every one of these doctors said, ‘How do you know so much about this?' Maybe I have a natural ability. Maybe I should have done that instead of running for president.”

March 6: “I don't need to have the numbers double because of one ship that wasn't our fault.”

March 8: “We have a perfectly coordinated and fine tuned plan at the White House for our attack on CoronaVirus.”

March 9: ““The Fake News Media and their partner, the Democrat Party, is doing everything within its semi-considerable power (it used to be greater!) to inflame the CoronaVirus situation, far beyond what the facts would warrant,”

March 13: ""I take no responsibility.""

Consider the issues of abortion and gay marriage. Both are legal in the US, and both are primarily social at the heart of their controversy (that is, the debate is largely over social values, not economic ones). Both are considered by many to have been won by the left since there are now federal regulations forcing all state and local governments to tolerate them. We will, for now, ignore how local and state governments can pass burdensome regulation to functionally ban abortion or gay marriage (mostly the former, from what I understand).

Assume there is a left-wing coalition that has control over enough of the left on all parts of the spectrum to be cohesive. This coalition is offering to push forth a law(s) that would get rid of the federal regulations/laws on both topics, and push the issue to the state/local governments.

1. If you are a conservative/traditionalist, what would you be willing in policy to give up for one or the other? What about both? 
2. If you are a liberal/progressive, what would you accept as payment to give this to conservatives for one or the other? What about both?

Lastly, since this place is not representative of America, what would the average conservative be willing to trade for the chance to undo these social defeats (hopefully there are sources on this)? I'm curious to understand how much these matter to conservatives, not just conservative elites. 

To answer my own question, I'll answer from the left. I would be willing to give up abortion for the right to cease its pro-corporation stances. I believe it's fairly clear that corporations don't have people's best interests at heart any more than they can get away with. Obviously, there is a difference between economic conservatives and social conservatives, but I doubt the former would get elected without the votes of the latter."

But there *were* meat markets, and they were probably very much like the [“wet markets”](https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2020/01/31/800975655/why-theyre-called-wet-markets-and-what-health-risks-they-might-pose) that spawned COVID-19.

> What's more, we likely got these disease from wild animals (pangolin or bats) which is not representative at all of our meat industry at large.

Wet markets are very much part of The Meat Industry^TM. It strikes me as strange that you don’t think the mass harvest of wild animals to sell as meat is an industry. Why? Just because your country doesn’t do it? 

“Our meat industry.” lmao This sounds an awful lot like, “My country is more civilized and is cleaner! We’re better than those savages *over there*.” It doesn’t matter. Look around you. In case you haven’t noticed, stuff that happens in other places can definitely affect everywhere else. 

By the way, every single one of the most common foodborne illnesses are from meat/dairy. The ones that supposedly come from plants are actually from livestock waste — or human excrement — applied to the plants. 

Also, a bunch of epidemics and pandemics from the last few decades were caused by humans consuming or otherwise using animals. 

* [SARS](https://www.who.int/ith/diseases/sars/en/) probably came from wet markets. 
* [H1N1](https://www.cdc.gov/h1n1flu/information_h1n1_virus_qa.htm) came from pigs. 
* [H7N9](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/260025) came from poultry in wet markets. 
* [MERS](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/middle-east-respiratory-syndrome-coronavirus-(mers-cov)) came from camels. 
* [Ebola](https://www.who.int/health-topics/ebola#tab=tab_1) came from wild animals, and likely originated in bats. 
* COVID-19, obviously.

It’s almost as if we were repeatedly warned that maybe we should leave animals the fuck alone. COVID-19 isn’t even as bad as it *could* be. Maybe we’ll keep fucking around until we wipe ourselves out. Deservedly."

Prolonged lockdown will manifest in a recession unlike anything you have seen before and will fuck your healthcare sector even worse than the virus does. Hospital won be just dealing with coronavirus patients, but also suicide victim and riot related injuries.

The virus will also likely return in full force because people started marching down the street in drove.

What Trump administration is proposing to do is for people to continue social distancing and avoid large crowd as they ""slowly"" return to work. However, as usual Trump failed to convey this properly and his timeline is a bit unrealistic as theres no way you will be able to open up by Easter. But thats just Trump. 

No duration of lockdown is gonna keep America virus free as the virus not only has an incubation stage of 14 days, it has also been observed to linger and remain infectious 24 days after symptom improve.  The virus is likely to become seasonal now."

I definitely think people should be prepared, but it's best when they prepare practically based off of accurate information. **""NJ and NY have expressed a high potential of using dorms for extra hospital beds, and looking at our current hospitalization trajectory and the inaction of Kemp to provide the projected resources, we will probably use the dorms, and with a lot less advanced notice from our own government/USG/GT (using New Orleans as an example)""** That's exactly what you're saying, and it's entirely logical and accurate, but it gives people reading it a better chance to prepare by accurately depicting what's already happened/going on without increasing panic.

They may have been worse than zero because if he had coronavirus like the article claims then back tracks but then implys (not a great article btw), not only would the urgent care not have been able to help him, had they accepted him they could've exposed a bunch of sick people with potentially weakend immune systems to the virus as well.  They could've put everyone there at risk. In other circumstances I would agree with you, but the virus has changed a lot. 

There's something more to this story. According to the article a perfectly healthy teen gets the sniffles, is turned away from urgent care for having insurance (having insurance is not a qualifier to getting tested for COVID19) and then dies of a heart attack on the way from the urgent care to the hospital. There's no mention of his symptoms (found another article saying respiratory issues, which leads me to believe he was turned away for exposure concerns) or condition other than going from healthy to kinda sick to dead. They don't even give the full speech from the mayor, who is the source for saying the kid was turned away with out insurance.  No statement from urgent care.  Nothing from the CDC other than they can't comment, via other articles. Nothing from the kids family. No follow up comments from the mayor (he hasn't made any, despite being asked by multiple journalists). There's more here we don't know and too much speculation so until the CDC concludes their investigation and we get to hear from the urgent care and the kids family, I am going to reserve judgement."

> Over time, I've learned that those who tell the best stories in the sport are neither the players nor the coaches. They are often more set back. They blend in with the decor, but play a crucial role. I am talking about the proposed equipment. 

> Due to the forced NHL break from the COVID-19 pandemic, I contacted Pierre Gervais, equipment manager of the Montreal Canadiens. Gervais is in its 31st season with the CH. Discreet and his business, he is a star in the world of hockey and professional sport. He is recognized as being extremely competent and above all respected by players and his peers. 

> It is around 10:30 am Thursday morning. Gervais has just completed training in the basement of his home in Saint-Mathieu-de-Beloeil with his sons Alexandre (9 years old) and Gabriel (10 years old). 

> ""They have a lot of energy. We have to make them move, ”he said, laughing! I think that many parents in their forties understand this reality perfectly. Pierre's spouse, Sophie Picard, is completing her studies to become a specialized nurse practitioner. Given the current crisis, his wife has temporarily put her studies on hold and works in a hospital. She is at the forefront of this battle to counter the coronavirus. 

> “She works very hard. As soon as she gets home, she cleans her hands, takes a shower and does her laundry to limit the chances of contagion, ""said Gervais. 

> The 58-year-old native of Trois-Rivières has seen and experienced everything in his sport. Work stoppages, the September 11 attacks, etc. But what we are going through is unique. 

> ""I can't wait for it to start again, it's scary. We work in entertainment. I fear that this crisis will leave its mark for a long time, ”he said. 

> Before practicing his profession, Gervais was first of all a lover of hockey. This passion, he never lost it. 

> ""I'm still a fan. I miss it so much. To me it’s still a game and a passion, it’s not a job. ” 

> To change my mind and have a little fun, I discussed a variety of subjects with Gervais. Here are a few. 

> 1- Michel Bergeron told me that it was he who gave you your first job as an equipment attendant in Trois-Rivières. What is your memory of it? 

> “The Trois-Rivières high school was very close to the arena. After school I always went to see the Draveurs to practice. I was a fan of the team. I was just working to buy my tickets. One day, Michel moved to the next house. It felt like Scotty Bowman had moved next door! I was too embarrassed to talk to him so my mom told him that if he ever needed help with the team, I would do it ""for free"". ""One day the team came back in the middle of the night, in the middle of a snowstorm. I had shoveled its entry. I believe his wife saw me. At one point, Mr. Bergeron called me and told me that he needed my help at the Coliseum during training camp. If he asked me for a foot, I would give him two. I wanted to make a good impression. ” It was in 1978. Gervais has been practicing his profession full time since! 

> 2- What is the best memory of your career? 

> ""You can't just pick one. But when Wayne Gretzky called me for the 2002 Olympics, I was no longer touching the ground. To be in the same room as Wayne, Mario Lemieux, Pat Quinn, etc ... It was magic. And winning gold is something that I will remember all my life. ""I will also never forget the closing of the Forum and the opening of the Molson Center, as it was called at the time."" 

> 3- A moment that marked you?
>“Saku Koivu's return to play after her cancer. I developed a very intimate relationship with him. When he arrived in Montreal for the first time, it was I who went to pick him up at the airport. He was tired, he had lots of questions. I asked him if he was hungry. He was hungry. I asked him what he wanted to eat and he replied to me from McDonald's! He had no money so I paid for his meal. ""I was one of the only people with his parents who could visit him at the hospital when he had cancer. It was difficult to see him in this state. I was so afraid it wouldn't work. When he came back, it was magic. I was crying. I was unable to contain my emotions. ""

>While some former top advisers acknowledge the difficulty Sanders has in overcoming Joe Biden's significant delegate lead, other allies of the Vermont senator note that his message and h**is agenda are well-suited to a moment when** [**millions of people are filing for unemployment** ](https://www.nbcnews.com/business/business-news/unemployment-claims-hit-3-million-last-week-n1169266)**and losing their health care while** [**large corporations seek billions in bail out funds**](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/if-you-liked-tarp-you-ll-love-new-coronavirus-bill-n1169776).

He is not just sitting idly by, but contributing actively to the crisis:

Even as some called for him to exit the race, Sanders **turned his campaign** into a vehicle to spread information about the outbreak and **explain why he believes progressive goals like ""Medicare for All"" are even more urgently needed**. **He used his mailing list to raise $2 million for coronavirus**, then **circulated a petition to support Amazon warehouse workers**. Earlier this week, Sanders streamed another event where **he explained all the details of the more than $2 trillion Senate coronavirus stimulus package** — what he liked and what he didn’t like, what he’d fought for and what Republicans had sought.

Meanwhile, Biden has barely been able to do much of anything:

>Zogby said that was an example of Sanders effectively using his platform to spread his message online.  
>  
>""Joe Biden, on the other hand, has not been able to do that,"" Zogby added. ""And when he has, there've been times when it just hasn't looked right, hasn't come off well.""

Bernie's recent viral speech on the Senate floor shows his continued spirit to fight for his principles and use his platform to exert more influence to fight for working people:

>Longabaugh pointed to that Senate floor speech as classic Sanders, and an example of how Sanders will use his large platform to exert influence as the crisis continues.

I would also personally add that the recent allegations regarding Biden are another reason for Bernie to stay. The allegations should be investigated and vetted."

2020-03-28,JordanFab120,Coronavirus,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/fqkk56/daily_discussion_post_march_28_questions_images/flriptd/,"With the ongoing crisis crippling the global economy and shutting down almost every aspect of society we take for granted, it’s easy to forget that this whole situation escalated due to the Chinese government covering up and censoring important information about the nature of the coronavirus and its ability to spread from person to person for weeks. Had they not done so, this pandemic wouldn’t ever have become as bad as it did.

In my opinion, China must be harshly punished and cannot get away with their misdeeds completely due to the considerable damage they’ve done to the livelihoods and well-being of billions of people worldwide. So what kind of punishments do you think should be handed down to China for the massive consequences of their inaction?

Me personally, I’d like to see most countries cease business relations with China and completely shut off any travel to that country, and China themselves should be forced to give up all their territorial claims around the globe as well as pay TRILLIONS of dollars to make up for the financial losses their coverups caused. I’m tired of those fuckers always getting their way due to their immense power and wealth, and I’d like for them to get hammered with Treaty of Versailles-style punishments to the point of rendering them irrelevant on the global stage for many, many years.

Feel free to point out if you consider my proposals to be a little too harsh- I will admit that there are worse situations than this one that more properly deserve such a harsh punishment."

2020-03-28,HunterIV4,politicsdebate,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/politicsdebate/comments/fok0i3/since_the_billionaire_capitalist_extracted_their/flrjd2y/,"> Paying substandard wages are a parasitic business practice that is detrimental to egalitarianism & society.

I disagree. Market competition makes life better for everyone. I don't think the people working for a wage get to decide what their labor is worth. Only the consumer of that labor (their employers) get to decide this.

This is how it works when you go to buy things from the grocery store: you don't get to go to the front counter and say you'll buy the milk for 25 cents when it's priced at a $1.50. You have the choice to either buy at the listed price or chose not to buy.

This ""right"" to a living wage is like going to your employer and saying that your work is worth $15 an hour when it's only worth $7 to the employer. You only get the choice of whether to take a price or not...and employers are perfectly within their right to simply not hire you at a higher price, and you are within your right to work somewhere else.

But you do not have the right to tell other people what they're allowed to spend. That is a violation of human rights.

>A belief in a basic human dignity, to not subject someone else to live like a second class citizen.

Who is forcing anyone to live as a second class citizen? Me not providing you everything you want is *not* the same as me taking something from you. Why is it ""basic human dignity"" for you to take what I have without doing the work I did to get it?

From my view that's simple jealousy and theft.

>I think that view promotes too much unnecessary Inequality which leads to discord and strife

Oh, so since you're not getting what you want, you threaten me? That's extortion. Everything about this worldview is dependent upon coercion and exploitation of others while *claiming* to be about equality. In an equal society some are going to have more than others because not everyone *is* equal. 

I am not Bill Gates, and I am not Brad Pitt, and I am not Lebron James. I do not have their business talent, their appearance and acting skill, nor their fitness and athletic ability. And they do not *owe* me anything in the name of ""equality.""

>I see both parties affected unequally and being treated unequally as well.

Agreed. The businesses are being shut down while a large number of the workers are still getting paid. This is unequal to the businesses.

>Why {in the original GOP stimulus} are the million and billion dollar companies getting a bailout and the working poor hypocritically are expected to have hade saved up for the crisis?

First of all, this is not a ""GOP stimulus."" The original bill was written and signed by the Democrat house and worked on by members of both parties. Pretending this was designed by the GOP and only tolerated by the Democrats is simply false.

Second, it's not a bailout. These are [loans](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/heres-what-the-historic-2-trillion-coronavirus-stimulus-package-will-do-to-help-small-businesses-2020-03-26), and while they may be forgiven under certain circumstances, this is *not* simply a handout (note: it *is* just a handout to people).

>are the millionaires One party, I think, has been responsible for the other party not being able to save for emergencies.

I don't even know what this sentence means.

>Furthermore, if that party has had millions in profits they should not be needing a bailout, and maybe they should have been compensating the other party [laborers] better.

Sigh, you clearly don't understand how businesses work. ""Profit"" is not money that is stuck in a vault somewhere. It is typically reinvested into expanding the business and paying shareholders, shareholders who provided the capital for the business to exist in the first place. It is not liquid funds that can simply be pulled out of a bank account and spent to keep the business afloat.

And part of that expansion involves hiring *more workers*. Profits are how businesses grow, and as a business grows it pays more people. This is why laborers are paid in the first place. If they compensated laborers more there would simply be more people unemployed. This is not complicated."

2020-03-28,dabhaze4daze,ILTrees,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/ILTrees/comments/fqpkr4/legalizing_pot_deliveries_gains_momentum_during/flrh6df/,"As Illinoisans are ordered to hunker down to prevent the spread of the new coronavirus, calls to allow legal marijuana deliveries have increased.

Rep. Sonya Harper (D-Chicago) introduced legislation last month that would allow cannabis dispensaries to deliver marijuana to both medical pot patients and recreational customers. Now, she’s calling on Gov. J.B. Pritzker to take immediate action amid the rising public health crisis.

“I would be happy to see if the governor maybe could make a special executive order allowing that, or us being able to get that legislation through maybe quicker than normal this year to provide for that,” said Harper, who co-sponsored the bill that legalized pot statewide at the start of the year.

That landmark piece of legislation didn’t include a provision allowing deliveries, though lawmakers discussed the prospect while it was being drafted.


Harper’s push to allow pot deliveries in the wake of the coronavirus crisis comes two weeks after officials allowed retailers to temporarily sell medical marijuana outside stores to protect patients who may be susceptible to COVID-19. The state’s more than 100,000 medical users can also have a registered caretaker pick up pot products for them.

Harper acknowledged that setting up a system for deliveries would be “more difficult” than allowing those curbside sales.

“It would entail basically giving all municipalities and everybody across the state the ability to open up deliveries,” she said. “It would also be creating a new type of license.”

Pritzker’s office didn’t respond to a request for comment, but state officials appear to be mulling whether to open up deliveries. A representative of a major Illinois cannabis firm, who asked not to be named, said the company has been included in some recent conversations.

“The state has been open-minded to evaluating and implementing new processes for the convenience of medical patients during this crisis, like curbside pickup, and conversations about how home delivery would work have definitely been part of that dialogue,” the industry insider said.

Margo Vesely, executive director of the Illinois chapter of the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws, said her group has recently been lobbying lawmakers to allow deliveries to medical patients.

“I think that we have to really hone in and focus on those that have those compromised immune systems and really look out for them at these times,” said Vesely. “Medical patients, if they have a weakened immune system, can’t be going into the dispensaries. And if they don’t have a caretaker, they’re stuck.

“So it would be really beneficial for them,” she added.

Harper noted that she’s recently seen people waiting to get inside dispensaries and that curbside sales are also attracting lines of cars. As officials institute strict measures to promote social distancing, she said “mobile delivery is probably needed in this time more than ever.”

However, Harper said it’s unclear whether home deliveries could be established without legislative approval, like curbside pickups. Passing her bill quickly through the Legislature also seems unrealistic, as the coronavirus has shut down sessions in Springfield for weeks.

“As it stands right now, the bill hasn’t even been heard in committee yet,” said Harper. “So we really haven’t even had a chance to discuss it, to even see any way that the bill needs to be changed or amended to meet the different needs of the different municipalities.”

“I think if we had the political will we could get together in a room and put that together now, but I do see things like that maybe taking time to figure out the details.”"

Supposing you do get sick with coronavirus, it's going to be fun watching your free market trip to the hospital:  


1. Don't call 911 - your taxes pay for those call centers.
2. Don't expect taxpayer funded Fire/EMS shows up, private ambulance only.
3. Don't let that ambulance take any taxpayer funded public roads.
4. Make sure you don't end up at a taxpayer funded public hospital.
5. Don't let them use taxpayer funded GPS to chart a route to the hospital either. Paper maps only. In fact, you better just take a private air ambulance. We'll ignore the part about it being a safe flight because taxpayer funded FAA is monitoring that airspace.
6. Maybe you could have a doctor come out to your house instead? But they'd also have to use those taxpayer funded roads.
7. Don't ask to see that doctor's credentials though. It's likely he went to a publicly funded university for his medical degree. And his certification and licensing to practice medicine was done by a government agency.
8. They could mail you medicine...but you'd need to avoid using USPS. I suppose FedEx could do it, but they're also reliant on that same public roads and free government GPS.

"" Åslög Dahl, researcher and responsible for the pollen laboratory at the University of Gothenburg, has made a quick comparison.


 - Where you have the highest mortality, there has also been the highest pollen content.  It's a very fast analysis that you can't really pull big gears on, ”she says.


 Åslög Dahl and specialist doctor Terje Lie have done a quick analysis of data from, among others, WHO and pollen count.  It shows that in the countries where the most cases of corona infection and highest mortality have been found, pollen levels have also been high.

 In countries with fewer cases of coronary infection and lower mortality, pollen levels have been low.  A previous large study, done before the time of the corona virus, has shown that pollen makes us more susceptible to viral infections.


 - When exposed to pollen levels, the content is lowered by a substance that acts as a neurotransmitter in the mucous membrane and that starts the general immune system against viruses if a lot of pollen and viruses end up on the mucous membrane, says Åslög Dahl.


 A large international study is already underway on the pollen effect on the coronavirus, but with the knowledge that exists on how pollen affects the immune system, Åslög Dahl believes that everyone should already follow the advice of allergy sufferers.  For example, it is about keeping track of the pollen forecast and not exercising hard outdoors at high pollen levels.


 - It can be good to stay inside as much as possible, if it is really high levels, and then you should have the windows closed both day and night.  You should also rinse your hair and maybe change clothes when you get home, says Åslög Dahl"""

They only tested a few hundred people per week. Meanwhile, they spoke to public about washing hands, xenophobia and minimizing the impact. The numbers were released and low because of lack of testiness available. Then the Los Angeles County Department of Public Health has advised doctors to only test patients for the coronavirus if a positive result would actually impact their treatment. This was not publicly released to the public amidst all the statements around hand washing, minimizing the problem and xenophobic narratives. It was then released in an article by the LA Times. So now we have minimal data, low numbers of cases related to deaths, misinformation and a lack of transparency about how LA is caring for its citizens. Within all of this, they go from minimizing to sending an alert at 9pm via text to residents that we are going on lock down. The lack of testing and the pull back of testing is clearly economic and I believe it was covered up among all the other narratives they pushed out. They were and are unprepared. Now we are hearing LA is going to be just as bad as NY in a few days. Without data or tests to confirm, we will have to wait and see the death to case ratio exceed any other city who actively tested during all of this."

A segunda foi na [base aérea de Anápolis (GO)](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/equilibrioesaude/2020/02/brasileiros-em-wuhan-serao-trazidos-ao-pais-e-ficarao-de-quarentena-em-goias.shtml), durante isolamento após repatriação da China. A terceira começa agora, com [o aumento de casos no país.](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/equilibrioesaude/2020/03/brasil-tem-92-mortes-por-coronavirus-numero-de-casos-vai-a-3417.shtml)

 Essa é a história de Vitor Neves e Mauro Hart, dois dos 34 brasileiros e seus familiares que viviam em Wuhan e foram trazidos pelo governo brasileiro quando o cerco ao coronavírus fechou a cidade chinesa.

 “Estou no meu terceiro isolamento, agora voluntário. Fico em casa porque não tenho necessidade de ir às ruas. Espero que não chegue ao ponto de ser um isolamento obrigatório”, diz Hart, 59, piloto de uma companhia aérea chinesa que está de licença em Natal até poder voltar à China.

 “Na terceira quarentena, já adquiri experiência. A questão é manter uma rotina e ficar tranquilo. Estou escrevendo minha dissertação, com uma carga de trabalho grande que me mantém ocupado”, conta Neves, 28, que de Belo Horizonte adianta o mestrado em linguística que deve finalizar neste semestre em Wuhan.

 Eles [chegaram ao Brasil em 9 de fevereiro](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/equilibrioesaude/2020/02/brasileiros-que-estavam-no-epicentro-do-coronavirus-na-china-chegam-em-goias-onde-ficarao-em-quarentena.shtml) —após longo processo de convencimento do governo Bolsonaro pela repatriação—, num [voo](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/equilibrioesaude/2020/02/missao-para-buscar-brasileiros-em-wuhan-tera-quatro-aeronaves-e-equipe-medica-a-bordo.shtml) com checagem periódica da temperatura dos passageiros, uso obrigatório de máscaras cirúrgicas, que deveriam ser trocadas a cada quatro horas, e uma tripulação coberta da cabeça aos pés com roupas de proteção.

  Na base militar em Goiás, ficaram isolados [junto com os tripulantes](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/equilibrioesaude/2020/02/militares-da-missao-de-evacuacao-a-china-tambem-passarao-por-quarentena-diz-bolsonaro.shtml) e a equipe médica que os trouxe da China por 14 dias, até que fosse comprovado que não tinham trazido o vírus ao Brasil.

 O [grupo saiu do isolamento em 23 de fevereiro](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/equilibrioesaude/2020/02/brasileiros-deixam-quarentena-apos-fim-da-suspeita-de-coronavirus.shtml), após testes confirmarem que não carregavam o novo coronavírus. Dois dias depois, o [primeiro caso era confirmado em São Paulo](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/equilibrioesaude/2020/02/brasil-confirma-primeiro-caso-do-novo-coronavirus.shtml), de um homem que viajou à Itália.

 Até a última sexta (27), pouco mais de um mês depois, o país já soma 3.417 casos confirmados e 92 mortes.

 “Quando cheguei, lavavam até o chão que eu pisava”, diz Hart. “O que me deixou bastante preocupado é que nos aeroportos não havia nenhuma medida consistente de verificação dos passageiros [de voos comerciais vindos de países com casos confirmados]”, diz ele.

 “Eu acho que a gente foi tratado da maneira correta, como deveria ser. Mas o baixo controle, não só no Brasil mas também em outros países, permitiu que o vírus entrasse”, afirma o piloto.

 [Só na última semana a cidade de Wuhan começou a aliviar a quarentena](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/mundo/2020/03/provincia-chinesa-onde-surgiu-coronavirus-anuncia-fim-do-confinamento-para-moradores.shtml), retomando o transporte público, depois de dois meses de políticas duras para conter o vírus.

 Para os brasileiros, os chineses souberam lidar com as restrições. “Bastou um anúncio na TV e, no dia seguinte, todo mundo usava máscara. Para o asiático, isso é muito fácil, porque eles já são acostumados a usar máscara em caso de gripe, virose, tosse, espirro”, diz Hart.

 “O chinês é bastante obediente a essas orientações. Quando falaram que tínhamos que ficar em casa, eles ficaram. Já o ocidental, não só o brasileiro, tem dificuldade de seguir isso à risca”, continua.

 Por aqui, as pessoas ainda estão aprendendo a lidar com isso, afirma Neves. “[A China teve medidas mais eficazes pelo fato de fecharem a cidade.](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/equilibrioesaude/2020/01/china-isola-area-com-40-milhoes-para-conter-coronavirus-26-ja-morreram.shtml) O governo levou mais a sério. Aqui, muitas coisas pararam, mas ainda há movimento em estradas, transporte, as pessoas saem sem máscara. Ainda está oscilando.”

 O estudante deixa um recado para os que aqui estão passando pela primeira vez pela experiência: “É importante ter a consciência de ficar em casa, adotar as medidas de higiene básica. Eu sei que é difícil, é estressante, mas temos que ter autocontrole. Esse vírus passa de humano para humano, então o combate é quase exclusivamente responsabilidade nossa”, diz.

 Para Hart, o Brasil tem a vantagem de já ter visto o estrago que o vírus fez na China, na Itália e na Espanha, e agir para evitar.

 Por outro lado, o país não tem a robustez econômica da China, e é preciso também fazer um cálculo econômico. “Deve haver um equilíbrio. O receio que eu tive era o total desabastecimento na China, que poderia levar a uma convulsão social”, diz ele. ""Graças a Deus não aconteceu."" 

 Ele diz que, para frear o avanço do vírus, esse choque pode ser necessário e momentâneo. ""Mas, dependendo do tempo, aos poucos as atividades têm que ser retomadas, com cuidado, higiene e distanciamento.”"

Let's take a Example. The Coronavirus Pandemic.

So what happens next is the Sections work together to find a compromise that benefits all, and then everyone in those respective section gets to vote on it.

Would that apply to COVID-19? We know it exists in the gut because it's present in feces, but as far as I know, people with gut symptoms usually follow a non-serious route. People with respiratory infection are the ones who get serious.

So this would suggest to me that *drinking* black tea would be an inefficient way of testing this since it doesn't tell us anything about people who actually get truly ill. It would be more useful to convert it into some other form...

2020-03-28,jvtin7,Nepal,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Nepal/comments/fqitbm/jeff_bezos_selling_his_shares_before_this/fls4v8b/,">But eating bats was not common in china

This is the old theory. When the virus was first sequenced, it was found to have a high degree of homology with a strain of coronavirus that is endemic to bats found in Hubei province in China. But later, they found that the receptor that allows the virus to enter human cells has an even higher homology to a different strain of coronavirus found in pangolins.

Pangolins are eaten in China as part of their traditional Chinese medicine. Over a million pangolins per year are butchered and sold for parts in Chinese apothecaries.

The current theory is that this strain of coronavirus is a merger of the bat and pangolin coronavirus, borrowing RNA from both strains. At this time, we don't know which animal the mixing occurred in - was it bats or pangolins or humans, or maybe some other species. Many exotic species of animals were sold at the Wuhan wet market before it was shut down.

There is no reason to believe that the virus was deliberately created and let loose. The likeliest explanation is that a natural exchange of genetic material between the bat and pangolin viruses occurred, and the virus then made the jump to humans in Wuhan. Unless another strain of virus even closer to the human strain is found in some other animal, this is the strongest theory right now.

Hopefully, China has closed the wet markets for good and they will not be reopened after the epidemic is over. It's risky for humans to be living so close to so many species of wild animals, selling them live in wet markets, and butchering them on the spot or in their homes."

Yes, they did in fact come from Mexico. But it’s not the widely-used, accepted name for them. It’s also confusing because other dog breeds originated in Mexico. And just because some dogs are named after where they came from (Norwegian Elkhound for example), doesn’t mean there is some rule that all dogs must be named after their origin point.

Getting back to the virus, you can call it Coronavirus or Covid-19 because that’s what it’s called. Calling it “China Virus” is wrong on purpose."

In the case of China I think we all know that the numbers are essentially made up. In the case of Germany the numbers are rock solid, but it’s almost impossible to glean or compare death rates because they basically don’t count deaths as being attributable to coronavirus in all but the smallest number of patient. For example if you die of respiratory failure and are coronavirus positive, they won’t even necessarily count that as a coronavirus death... only if you have absolutely no other medical history and even then they might not. Frankly I can’t really understand why they bother publishing their death stats because they’re so meaningless they’re of no use to anybody."

Best part quoted:

Why President Trump decided that Rodriguez, who is not an epidemiologist, would have answers on how to best curb the spread of COVID-19 is beyond me. It probably has to do with the fact that A-Rod, who does not own a doctor’s white coat, is wealthy and frequently on television. One can only hope that Rodriguez, who does not have a medical license, told the President that invoking the Defense Production Act to force manufacturers to make ventilators and PPE was a good idea.

Rodriguez, who is not a doctor, donated to Hillary Clinton’s campaign in 2016.

Yes, he bribed and extorted ukraine. He did both. It is undeniable. He also obstructed congress. That is also undeniable.

The video isnt doctored. Doctored would mean stitching together a video or slowing it down. They left ample time between each of Trump's talking points. Trump said ""it is their (meaning democrat) new hoax."" He was saying dems are politicizing it against him. And they're right to do it. Trump did play down the coronavirus, that it wasnt as serious as Democrats were making. Remember him saying we only have 15 cases and soon it will be zero? Hell he just downplayed new york's need for ventilators and then the next day forced GM to produce more. Heres some history of Trump downplaying the virus.

The disease it causes is called Covid-19(**Co**rona**vi**rus **d**isease, identified in 2019).

These names provide far more information into what is being dealt with than “wuhan flu”. Because a) even though it seems to have originated there, it’s not geographically constrained, and b) it’s not a flu. Completely different type of virus.

Pretty sure this guy is NOT the sort of landlord you're talking about.



Additonally, I haven't seen anyone asking for free rent forever, just reduced or 1-2 months of forgiven rent as long as they're out of work due to COVID-19. And for the latter they're overwhelmingly calling for the same thing for the type of small business, mom and pop landlords you're talking about. 

I'm in Seattle, so we have a lot of anti-capitalist people in the area. Are these free rent forever requests something you're hearing directly from your tenants?"

Nor would China risk a proxy war with the US, or vice versa, as we are dependent on each other for our economies. The USSR/Russia and likewise the US were never dependent on each other, economically.

Given that coronavirus shows to many companies that they have to (internationally) diversify their production chains plus political efforts to ""rehome"" critical production, it is likely that the economic importance of China will rapidly fade, so the leverage China has at the moment will fade soon.

> Not that I advocate it, but I fail to see how another proxy war is going to change much. America is literally always at war, we've been warmongers since post-WW2.

I can imagine that there will be escalations over either North Korea or Taiwan though. North Korea has the disadvantage here that (rightfully) *no one* except China, Russia and Iran likes them (Iran will be devastated after Corona, they are totally underwater and even parts of their government got it)... they're an easy target for the US to make a point, liberating the North Korean people would earn the US a *lot* of international goodwill, the only thing is someone needs to convince Israel to export it's Iron Dome to SK to avoid it being annihilated by NK missiles.

Nobody facially disagrees with any of these things. Here is the nuance they disagree with: 

1) Go the fuck home is telling them to leave the USA and go back to \[insert Asian country\]. It's a xenophobic remark, not a promotion of public health. 

2) Stop eating bats (cats and etc.) is a racist remark that is aimed at other cultures for eating what the West considers inappropriate animals, ignoring the fact that what is seen as an inappropriate or appropriate animal to eat is based almost entirely on cultural norms. There are ways to eat cats, bats, etc. without the spread of disease. The author isn't interested in that reality though, only in the fact that these cultural savages eat inappropriate animals. She's also applying a huge blanket statement to all of Asia, when, in reality, these practices are increasingly rare and not practiced by most in many parts of Asia. 

3) We are talking about coronavirus. Why is this relevant here? It's only relevant, because the author wants to continue pointing out how Asians are cultural savages. Nobody would disagree with stop poaching. People do disagree with claiming random Asian students are in any way responsible for causing poaching and deserve peoples' ire. 

4) Her counterfeiting goods point isn't even coherent. It's obviously another jab at these people she sees as cultural savages. She doesn't even say why counterfeit goods are bad and instantly links it back to Rhinos and dicks getting big. She's clearly just lashing out. Still, most people wouldn't disagree counterfeiting is bad. They'd just disagree how she's aiming this at 3 billion Asians. 

5) She's also blaming ""3 billion"" Asians for causing Coronavirus, when it looks like it started in just one Asian country. There are more than two dozen other countries in East Asia, Southeast Asia, and South Asia. It's incredibly racist to lump them all together and blame them for the virus. 

6) She starts out calling them an overpopulated mess. Imagine if someone called Europe or the United States that? It'd clearly carry some racial baggage against white people. Who decides when a country is overpopulated? Who decides how a country gets to grow a population? Apparently, for her, it's white people, and white people have decided there are too many yellow people. 

7) The deep irony of claiming that Asians are responsible for the complete destruction of the planet when the Western world spent a lot of time shitting all over those countries with wars, colonization, and economic suppression, all of which slowed their economic development and likely created many of the population, pollution, and industrialization problems today. It also ignores the massive amount of contribution made to the world destruction by the Western world and how the Western world is generally MUCH worse on a per capita basis."

The university believes it is imperative to continue to support students and to help as much as possible those that might be needing work if they lost their community-based job. Here are the guidelines ASU will be following:

1. All students employed on ASU payroll will be continued through Friday, May 8 (end of semester), if they are willing to work remotely. If units cannot find work for them, the university will continue pay for students from the original hiring unit and keep them employed in other units for appropriate work. 
2. All student workers employed on grant funding will continue as long as there is work they can perform remotely. If there is no work that can be adapted to a remote environment, the university will make every effort to sustain the employment of these students by finding alternative assignments they can do remotely. 
3. Moving forward for the remainder of the semester, it is the university’s goal is to keep the student employed in a similar number of hours to their original assignment.
4. All student referrals and the work redeployment initiative will be coordinated through the Student Employment Office. Students can contact Student Employment through their My ASU Service Center to [chat with us](https://myasu.force.com/) or [submit a case](https://myasu.force.com/). The Student Employment Office will be working directly with Educational Outreach and Student Services, and these two areas will be tasked in finding alternative units for work. The EOSS point of contact is [Michele Grab.](mailto:Michele.Grab@asu.edu)
5. If a student is working off campus and needs work, the [Student Employment Office](https://students.asu.edu/employment) and [Educational Outreach and Student Services](https://eoss.asu.edu/) will seek to find them opportunities to work for ASU remotely. "

No fucking shame at all, going completely out of his way to say ""Hey South Carolinians, I signed this because a lot of y'all would be screwed otherwise, but also want you to know that I fought tooth and nail to ensure that you got a shittier deal. Especially so for those that were 10x more likely to be laid off from their exceptionally low-paying jobs—jobs that are the only thinly-wound lifeline keeping a roof over their families' heads.""

Fuck Graham forever. He is thoroughly the antichrist in every single possible way."

Trump is facing a horrible situation and is not dealing with it in a reasonable manner.  Please explain to me how our ""Great"" country can have a three month head start before the coronavirus gets here and we now have more coronavirus cases.

This atrocious situation is going to continue until someone starts making Trump listen to the experts by criticizing him.  Not mollycoddling him because someone you know called him racist.

So, if you have a problem with Right Wing Watch tattletaling on right-wing groups, then you should volunteer whether you yourself are a member of such a right-wing group.

An ongoing worldwide pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), a new infectious disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), was first confirmed to have spread to the United States in January 2020. Cases have been confirmed in all fifty U.S. states, the District of Columbia, and all inhabited U.S. territories except American Samoa and the Northern Mariana Islands. As of March 26, 2020, the U.S. has the most confirmed active cases in the world and ranks sixth in number of total deaths from the virus.The first known case of COVID-19 in the U.S. was confirmed on January 20, 2020, in a 35-year-old man who had returned from Wuhan, China, five days earlier. The White House Coronavirus Task Force was established on January 29.

2020-03-28,IronMew,Multicopter,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Multicopter/comments/fqgadz/motors_all_day/flrl98h/,"When I acquired those motors - and heaps of 4S 1300-1500mAh batteries - I used to live in a sleepy town in northern Italy, surrounded by fields and mountains where nobody gave two shits if you flew a heavy-lift octacopter. 

Then I moved to Madrid, which is one big no-fly zone - there's three airports and every hospital has its own helipad, and you can't fly in a range of eight kilometres of any of them. I checked the local no-fly map and it's a crisscross of circles that leaves nothing uncovered. 

However I talked at length with a friend who works for the relevant government entity - a lucky coincidence, not a friendship I went looking for specifically - and they told me that they were about to pass a law that excepted drones lighter than 150 grams; in theory those would be able to fly anywhere at all, including smack dab in the city centre. The way I understand it is those are considered to all intents and purposes as harmless toys under all circumstances, so rules about safe flight, line-of-sight and such no longer apply. 

I was waiting for further details when the whole coronavirus madness started so I'm not sure at what stage the process is now, but I should hear from my friend as soon as the quarantine ends (might be in ten days, might be in two months...) and get updates. 

This is good and bad. Bad because there's so many parks in this city that have relatively few people in them where I'd have loved to fly my fleet of five-inchers, and that's not going to happen. Good because I should be able to fly toothpicks and whoops in full legality everywhere now, which opens up so many interesting possibilities. 

I still plan on bringing my five-inch quads here, but I won't be able to fly them without a trip to somewhere legal. The closest such location from my home is 25km away through two towns in the outskirts, which makes five-inch flight a weekend plan rather than the random ""I feel like flying right now"" activity it used to be.

So I'm going to use those motors and those batteries eventually, but they're on the back burner at the moment while I wait for flash sales so I can stock up on micro parts. In the meantime I'll be digging out my old brushed stuff - cause I've got to fly on *something*."

Particularly for the millions of people who have never used or don't understand Bitcoin yet.

Right now, I'm seeing a lot of positive scientific developments despite government floundering. Ventilators are being made. Hydroxychloroquine, vaccines, and even antibody blood transfusions are hopeful. Besides, the CFR looks to be around 1% which is very bad but would mean 99% of people will survive.

Kickstarting the economy again after the lockdown will take time. People will still be afraid to travel, go on cruises, particularly because a large number of cases will continue to be around for a long time, even into 2021.

A lot of businesses will collapse. This will mean a lot of people out of work (we've already seen 3 million filed for unemployment, a new record). On top of this, ""cheap money"" will be flooding in for SOME people (who have the credit), causing a rise in prices. This will be OK for people who have decent jobs, but will be horrible for people without jobs.

The situation becomes similar to Venezuela. We have a lot of poor people. So how do we solve the problem of people not having enough money? That's right, the government will print more of it. Causing even higher prices, and more poor people. Over, and over. And people will be wondering, ""why isn't it working?""

So, Bitcoin will not rise rapidly while the coronavirus is threatening people who need food and shelter.

But once that is over, and the economic engines are croaking, unable to get started, a desperate, hungry, angry population will DEMAND the government to DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT which they will make it worse by providing more money, food, shelter to everyone until the country is bankrupt and the dollar is worthless.

And this is when Bitcoin's time will have come."

>The Chinese have been spreading a lot of misinformation about this. Even the WHO was tricked.

No. Trump outrightly called it a 'Chinese Virus', thus exciting racial hatred. You can see this being the case, with some Republicans calling for Chinese students to be sent back to China.

No-one is in any doubt that the Chinese Government is reprehensible - not only in their flagrant disregard for Human Rights, but also in their lack of concern for the spread of COVID19 to the rest of the world. However, a world leader labelling a Virus as belonging to that of an entire race of people, thus exciting racial tension? Do you think that's smart, or appropriate in this climate?

Maybe if you were Chinese, you'd think differently.

>That’s not necessarily his job.

Yet right now, he keeps tweeting about ventilators. It's not his job to ensure America has access to plenty of Coronavirus test kits, but it is his job to ensure America has access to plenty of ventilators? Which is it?

>Are you pearl clutching about rhetoric?

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ExWLn86Mu_g

This is Trump saying he would like passengers, numbering into the hundreds, who were on a cruise ship were 20 or so coronavirus cases were confirmed, to stay on the ship, because he doesn't need the ""numbers to double, because of one ship"".

These are human beings on a ship with very sick people. Americans, mind you, if that makes any difference. To leave the hundreds of people on the ship would mean they would all likely get infected - if there were any elderly/physically abled people on the ship, they could die.

Are you calling this rhetoric?

>That is also incorrect. You should really look into where you are getting your news. Reddit news and political subreddits have a strong bias and often have misinformation or outright falsehoods pushed to the front page.

And no every country does not work the same way. In more southern countries people are very close to each other and have a lot of physical contact.

Biden could literally go into a coma on day 1 and even if the VP didn't take over, Biden would do a better job than Trump.

I've made a huge post about this topic elsewhere (I can share if you're interested in a long read), but even if you remove Biden and Trump from the equation entirely, one of them has surrounded themselves in an administration of incompetent outsider yes-men, while the other clearly favors competent insiders. The difference in that approach is the difference between a functioning EPA or CDC or FCC or FBI and one that is inert. Hillary would have appointed the head of the CDC (or similar expert) to deal with the Coronavirus when informed about it, and it would have been dealt with on a level similar to South Korea at best or China at worst.
Instead, hundreds of thousands (possibly millions!) will die because Trump's administration is full of yes-men.

I cannot stress enough how much better any neoliberal would be than Trump."

Chinese Journal of Epidemiology 2020 Expert group from Chinese Preventive Medicine Association on prevention and control of Novel Coronavirus Pneumonia. Chinese Journal of Viral Diseases 2020 COVID-19 patients with underlying disease have high mortality More than 75% of patients who die of COVID-19 have more than one underlying disease such as cardiovascular and cerebrovascular disease, diabetes, respiratory infectious disease, hypertension and cancer. Age ≥75 years, acute infectious diseases (especially severe infections or sepsis), respiratory failure, heart failure (New York heart function class III or IV), obesity (body mass index ≥30 kg/m2), previous VTE medical history, acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, acute cerebral infarction, acute coronary syndrome, varicose veins of the lower limbs, malignant tumour, inflammatory bowel disease, chronic kidney disease. Advanced age is an independent risk factor for VTE. More than 60% of VTE incidents occur in seniors over 65. Caprini risk assessment model is recommended for gravida or parturient, if infected with COVID-19, and combined the following risk factors concurrently: immobilization, VTE history, preeclampsia or intrauterine growth retardation, thrombophilia, blood transfusion, postpartum infection, supervene with systemic lupus erythematosus, heart disease, and sickle cell anemia, etc., suggesting higher VTE risk exists; other risk factors include obesity, polycyesis, and postpartum hemorrhage, etc. Pulmonary Embolism and Pulmonary Vascular Disease Group, Respiratory Medicine Branch, Chinese Medical Association et al. Overall assessment, including underlying diseases, laboratory tests, combined medications, and invasive procedures should be performed to patients before preventive measures are taken. Be wary of prior : (1) Active hemorrhage, such as uncontrolled gastrointestinal ulcers, hemorrhagic disease, etc.; (2) Previous history of intracranial hemorrhage or other hemorrhoea; (3) Uncontrolled hypertension, SBP > 180 mmHg and/or DBP > 110 mmHg; (4) Intracranial diseases that may cause severe bleeding, such as acute stroke (within 3 months), severe brain or acute spinal cord Injury; (5) Diabetes; (6) Malignant tumour; (7) Severe renal failure or liver failure, etc.

The COVID-19, on the other hand, has killed a little over 30,000 (in 3 months) out of about 170,000 cases that have had an outcome so far (https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/) which means that if you caught it you would have about an 17.8% chance of dying. In other words, you are about 185x as likely to die from catching the Coronavirus as you are from catching the flu. That's why it's scary.

Now the best part is that the COVID-19 numbers I just quoted were from the global statistics and the CDC flu numbers were just the American cases. If you look at just the American COVID-19 deaths it gets *much* worse. In the US there have been 1,943 deaths out of 5,167 completed cases putting the death rate at a whopping 37.6% chance.

Discreet and his business, he is a star in the world of hockey and professional sport. He is recognized as being extremely competent and above all respected by players and his peers.

> ""I'm still a fan. I miss it so much. To me it’s still a game and a passion, it’s not a job. ” 

> To change my mind and have a little fun, I discussed a variety of subjects with Gervais. Here are a few.

> “The Trois-Rivières high school was very close to the arena. After school I always went to see the Draveurs to practice. I was a fan of the team. I was just working to buy my tickets. One day, Michel moved to the next house. It felt like Scotty Bowman had moved next door! I was too embarrassed to talk to him so my mom told him that if he ever needed help with the team, I would do it ""for free"". ""One day the team came back in the middle of the night, in the middle of a snowstorm. I had shoveled its entry. I believe his wife saw me. At one point, Mr. Bergeron called me and told me that he needed my help at the Coliseum during training camp. If he asked me for a foot, I would give him two. I wanted to make a good impression. ” It was in 1978. Gervais has been practicing his profession full time since!

Throughout this whole pandemic, I've been going mad trying to read a comprehensive account as to why a wealthy, technologically advanced country like the US wasted away entire months' head start. Central to this issue has been the US's failure to develop and roll out an effective, widespread testing for COVID-19. Here's three main reasons explaining why that happened, summarizing relevant pieces of the article for those without access:

**1. Ineffective leadership:**

**1a The White House:**
- Jennifer Nuzzo, an epidemiologist at Johns Hopkins, said the Trump administration had “incredibly limited” views of the pathogen’s potential impact

- At the start of that crucial lost month, when his government could have rallied, the president was distracted by impeachment and dismissive of the threat to the public’s health or the nation’s economy

- Mr. Trump claimed the virus was about to dissipate in the United States, saying: “It’s going to disappear. One day — it’s like a miracle — it will disappear.”

- Meanwhile, the CDC’s epidemiologists were growing more concerned as the virus spread in South Korea and Italy. On Feb. 25, Dr. Messonnier gave a briefing with a much blunter warning than usual. “Disruption to everyday life might be severe,” she said.

- Mr. Trump, returning from a trip to India, was furious, according to senior administration officials. Later that day, Mr. Azar seemed to be tamping down the level of concern

- Faced with the coronavirus, Mr. Trump chose not to have the White House lead the planning until nearly two months after it began. Mr. Obama’s global health office had been disbanded a year earlier. And until Mr. Pence took charge, the task force lacked a single White House official with the power to compel action

- In tacit acknowledgment of testing shortage, Mr. Trump asked South Korea’s president on Monday to send as many test kits as possible from the 100,000 produced there daily, more than the country needs

**1b Secretary of HHS Alex M. Azar II:**

- Alex M. Azar II oversaw the two other agencies and coordinated the government’s public health response to the pandemic. While he grew frustrated as public criticism over the testing issues intensified, he was unable to push either agency to speed up or change course

- Mr. Azar chaired the coronavirus task force until late February, when Vice President Mike Pence took charge

- He had been at odds for months with the White House over other issues. The task force’s chief liaison to the president was Mick Mulvaney, the acting White House chief of staff, who was being forced out by Mr. Trump. Without high-level interest — or demands for action — the testing issue festered.

- As public attention on the virus threat intensified in January and February, Mr. Azar grew increasingly frustrated about the harsh spotlight on his department and the leaders of agencies who reported to him, according to people familiar with the response to the virus inside the agencies.

- Throughout February, as the CDC’s test faltered, Mr. Azar became convinced that Dr. Redfield’s agency was providing him with inaccurate information about testing that the secretary repeated publicly, according to several administration officials

- even in the face of a crescendo of complaints from doctors and health care researchers around the country, Mr. Azar failed to push those under him to do the one thing that could have helped: broader testing.

- Around noon on Feb. 27, Dr. Hahn, Dr. Redfield and top aides from the FDA and HHS. dialed in to a conference call. Mr. Harrison began with an ultimatum: No one leaves until we resolve the lag in testing… Get it done

- But the evening before, Mr. Azar had been effectively removed as the leader of the task force when Mr. Trump abruptly put Mr. Pence in charge, a decision so last-minute that even the top health officials in the White House learned of it while watching the announcement

**1c Director of CDC, Dr. Robert R. Redfield:**

- Dr. Robert R. Redfield, a former military doctor who directs the CDC, trusted his veteran scientists to create the world’s most precise test for the coronavirus and share it with state laboratories.

- Dr. Redfield, a longtime AIDS researcher, had never run a government agency before his appointment to lead the CDC in 2018

**1d FDA Commissioner, Dr. Stephen Hahn:**

- Dr. Stephen Hahn, the commissioner of the FDA, enforced regulations that paradoxically made it tougher for hospitals, private clinics and companies to deploy diagnostic tests in an emergency

- Dr. Stephen Hahn’s first day as FDA commissioner came just six weeks before Mr. Azar declared a public health emergency on Jan. 31

- Overnight, Dr. Hahn’s mission — to manage 15,000 employees in a culture defined by precision and caution — was upended... It would fall to the newly arrived Dr. Hahn to help build a huge national capacity for testing by academic and private labs.

- Under his leadership, the FDA became a significant roadblock, according to current and former officials as well as researchers and doctors at laboratories around the country.

- Dr. Hahn took a cautious approach. He was not proactive in reaching out to manufacturers, and instead deferred to his scientists, following the FDA’s often cumbersome methods for approving medical screening.

- Ironically, it was Mr. Azar’s emergency declaration that established the rules Dr. Hahn insisted on following


**2. Regulatory hurdles:**

- Three agencies responsible for detecting and combating threats like the coronavirus failed to prepare quickly enough

- The CDC also tightly restricted who could get tested and was slow to conduct “community-based surveillance,” a standard screening practice to detect the virus’s reach

- Mr. Azar’s emergency announcement created a new barrier for hospitals and laboratories that wanted to create their own tests to diagnose the coronavirus. Usually, they faced minimal federal regulation

- But once Mr. Azar acted, they were subject to an FDA process called an “emergency use authorization.”

- Even though researchers around the country quickly began creating tests that could diagnose Covid-19, many said they were hindered by the FDA’s approval process. The new tests sat unused at labs around the country.

- Officials at the FDA tried to be responsive, Dr. Miller said. But rather than throw out the rules, the agency only modified the regulatory requirements, still requiring weeks of discussions and negotiations


**3. Technical failures**

- To identify the virus, the CDC test used three small genetic sequences to match up with portions of a virus’s genome extracted from a swab. A German-developed test that the WHO was distributing to other countries used just two, potentially making it less precise

- Soon after the FDA cleared the CDC to share its test kits with state health department labs, some discovered a problem. The third sequence, or “probe,” gave inconclusive results. While the CDC explored the cause — contamination or a design issue — it told those state labs to stop testing.

- The startling setback stalled the CDC’s efforts to track the virus when it mattered most. By mid-February, the nation was testing only about 100 people per day, according to the CDC’s website

- The lack of tests in the states also meant local public health officials could not use another essential epidemiological tool: surveillance testing

- The CDC gave little thought to adopting the test being used by the WHO The CDC’s test was working in its own lab — still processing samples from states — which gave agency officials confidence. Dr. Anne Schuchat, the agency’s principal deputy director, would later say that the CDC did not think “we needed somebody else’s test.”

- And the German-designed WHO test had not been through the American regulatory approval process, which would take time."

&#x200B;

We both go to the same University and the second time around she didn't had a venmo link, so I figured ""She's pretty cute"".   


&#x200B;

I...don't know what to say, but we met, and overall she seems like a decent person. So I've been rethinking my ideas of if every female who advertises venmo is a shallow instagram model sorta person. You know the type.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

So we got to talking, and from what I can glean, she thinks people who simply send her money when she merely provided her Venmo ID are people being outright moronic. She needs money for tuition, and likes money in general. A bit of a party sorority girl, but she isn't a bad person.

It's not clear whether that is even the goal here, so it may not be applicable.
* Agree about the experimental therapies, I wouldn't advocate for Mainer's to be guinea pigs... But I feel this is between patient and physician, as it is in NY.

2020-03-28,ThatOneThingOnce,TrumpCriticizesTrump,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrumpCriticizesTrump/comments/fqqsx3/barackobama_has_accumulated_more_debt_in_3_years/flrnrqe/,"This one is a little tricky to show context for, as the original tweet is a lie (no surprise there). But, let's look at the details.


By the end of Clinton's second term (in 2000 as the 42nd president), the national debt stood at $5.67 trillion according to [this source](https://www.statista.com/statistics/187867/public-debt-of-the-united-states-since-1990/). That should therefore represent the total accumulated debt from the first 42 presidents combined. 


Obama, who came into office in 2009 until when the tweet was issued, technically only signed off on $3.1 trillion of new debt by the end of 2011, which is nowhere close to the $5.6 trillion accumulated by the first 42 presidents. However, Trump may have been counting the 2009 budget deficit as well under Obama, even though it was signed off by Bush in 2008 (a common tactic by politicians, even if not accurate). Including this spending puts the total at $4.77 trillion in new debt. This is still about a trillion short of what was actually accumulated by the first 42 presidents. However, at the time of the tweet, Obama had signed the next fiscal year budget and had a projected budget deficit for that year. Adding this extra debt in, the total (finally) reaches $6 trillion, which is more than the first 42 presidents combined. Again, the tweet is at best misleading or else just a straight up lie, but the number to beat stands at $5.67 trillion, or even $6 trillion if you just want to use Obama's inflated figure.


Trump, in the three years he has signed a budget, has accumulated $3.655 trillion in national debt (from 2018-2020). However, he also just signed a massive economic stimulus bill that was completely unfunded, and which will fall in the 2020 FY. Some of that is in the form of loans that will get paid back to the government, so let's generously count them as non-contributors to the deficit/debt. That leaves $1.396 trillion in additional debt spending according to [this source](http://www.crfb.org/blogs/whats-2-trillion-coronavirus-relief-package) on the stimulus bill which Trump just signed. Adding that to his last three FY signatures brings the total to $5.05 trillion, which is higher than Obama's first 3 FY spending was, including his predecessors 2009 budget. 


However, on top of that, if we are being generous, Trump has submitted a FY 2021 budget with a deficit of $0.966 trillion that he will sign this year (and that matches up with his logic previously under Obama). Assuming he received all that he wanted in budget cuts (which he won't) and that tax revenue will match the projections his administration made a month or so ago (it won't, considering the economic/health crisis we are in), that puts his grand total projected debt collected for the nation at $6.017 trillion, which is the magic number he needs to be above to have spent more than the first 42 presidents combined.


[Here's the source](https://www.thebalance.com/us-debt-by-president-by-dollar-and-percent-3306296) for both Obama's and Trump's deficit spending per year. And [here is the source](https://www.latimes.com/world-nation/story/2020-02-10/trump-budget-to-face-skepticism-overwhelming-politics) for the FY 2021 budget deficit projection.


TL;DR: Using the logic of this tweet (which is granted, lying), the first 42 presidents accumulated $5.7 trillion in debt. Trump, thanks to this economic stimulus he just signed, will generate $6 trillion in national debt over the last three years. So he will have effectively increased the debt by more than the first 42 presidents in 3 years.


Didn't think I would get to use this tweet as a Trump Criticizes Trump post tbh, but here we are."
2020-03-28,Noirceuil,france,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/france/comments/fqjc1w/exclusif_une_majorité_de_français_juge_désormais/flro3lw/,"""**23 janvier 2020**

Bonsoir, à vous qui êtes dans la salle et à tous ceux qui sont en ligne. 

Je tiens à remercier à nouveau le Dr Houssin, qui a dirigé d’une main de maître les débats très complexes du Comité d’urgence. Je remercie encore, également, tous les membres du Comité pour leur dévouement et leur expertise. 

Je ne déclare pas d’urgence de santé publique de portée internationale aujourd’hui. 

Comme hier, le Comité d’urgence était divisé sur la question de savoir si la flambée due au nouveau coronavirus constituait une urgence de santé publique de portée internationale. 

Ne vous trompez pas. C’est une urgence en Chine mais pas encore une urgence sanitaire mondiale. 

L’OMS estime que cette flambée représente un risque très élevé en Chine et un risque élevé aux niveaux régional et mondial. 

À ce jour, 584 cas, dont 17 mortels, ont été notifiés à l’OMS. 575 de ces cas et l’ensemble des décès ont été notifiés en Chine, tandis que les autres cas ont été notifiés aux États-Unis d’Amérique, au Japon, en République de Corée, à Singapour, en Thaïlande et au Viet Nam. Nous avons connaissance de cas suspects rapportés par les médias dans d’autres pays, mais ces cas font encore l’objet d’enquêtes. 

Je vais vous dire ce que nous savons. 

Nous savons que ce virus peut provoquer de graves symptômes et entraîner la mort, même si, chez la plupart des gens, les symptômes sont plus bénins. 

Nous savons qu’un quart des patients infectés ont présenté des manifestations graves. 

Nous savons que la plupart des personnes décédées présentaient des pathologies sous-jacentes (hypertension, diabète ou maladies cardiovasculaires) qui ont affaibli leur système immunitaire. 

Nous savons qu’il y a transmission interhumaine en Chine, mais cette transmission semble, pour le moment, limitée aux groupes familiaux et aux agents de santé qui se sont occupés de patients infectés. 

Il n’y a pas, à ce jour, de preuve de transmission interhumaine en dehors de la Chine, mais ceci ne signifie que cette éventualité est exclue. 

Nous ignorons encore beaucoup de choses. Nous ne connaissons pas la source de ce virus, nous ne savons pas avec quelle facilité le virus se transmet et nous ne connaissons pas précisément le tableau clinique ou la gravité de l’infection. 

L’OMS collabore nuit et jour avec ses partenaires en Chine et dans les autres pays touchés, au niveau régional et ici au Siège pour remédier aussi vite que possible à ce manque de connaissances. 

Il y aura probablement de nouveaux cas dans d’autres régions de Chine et dans d’autres pays. 

La Chine a pris les mesures qu’elle juge appropriées pour endiguer la propagation du coronavirus à Wuhan et dans d’autres villes. 

Nous espérons que ces mesures seront efficaces et appliquées pendant peu de temps. 

Pour le moment l’OMS ne recommande pas de restriction générale des voyages et du commerce. 

Nous recommandons un dépistage à la sortie dans les aéroports, dans le cadre de mesures globales de confinement. 

Tous les pays doivent mettre en place des mesures pour détecter les cas d’infection par le coronavirus, y compris dans les établissements de santé. 

Le Comité a émis plusieurs recommandations tendant à éviter que le virus ne continue à se propager, que le Président a exposées et que j’ai acceptées. 

Nous pouvons tous prendre quelques mesures simples pour nous protéger mutuellement, par exemple nous laver les mains et nous couvrir la bouche et le nez quand nous éternuons. 

L’OMS a posté beaucoup d’informations sur son site Web.  

Je tiens à remercier à nouveau le Gouvernement de la République populaire de Chine pour sa coopération et sa transparence. Le Gouvernement a pu isoler et séquencer le virus très rapidement et il a communiqué la séquence génétique à l’OMS et à la communauté internationale. 

Cette flambée a été détectée car la Chine avait mis en place a système permettant d’identifier spécifiquement les cas d’infection des voies respiratoires inférieures. C’est grâce à ce système que cet événement a pu être repéré. 

Je tiens à réaffirmer que, bien que je ne déclare pas d’urgence de santé publique de portée internationale aujourd’hui, l’OMS estime que la situation est grave et elle prend cette situation au sérieux. 

Rien n’est plus vrai. 

L’OMS suit la situation de cette flambée minute après minute et jour après jour, aux niveaux national, régional et mondial. 

Nous travaillons pour prévenir la transmission interhumaine. 

Nous avons fourni des orientations à tous les pays pour l’identification, la prise en charge et le confinement rapides des cas d’infection. 

Nous coordonnons nos réseaux d’experts mondiaux. 

Nous travaillons pour progresser dans la mise au point d’outils de diagnostic, de traitements et de vaccins. 

Nous sommes déterminés à mettre fin à cette flambée dès que possible. 

Et je n’hésiterai pas à reconvoquer le Comité quand je le jugerai nécessaire. 

Je vous remercie.""

Family businesses closed forever, empty storefronts like missing teeth all along main street, just waiting to be filled in by the rot of mega-chains. Old, tired men and women who scraped and saved their whole lives watching their nest eggs evaporate - back to work, Dad. Families made homeless. Careers derailed forever. Young people's bright futures destroyed.


You say that like mass deaths and illness killing family business owners (literally) and hospitals closing due to over population, and riots as a result of literally no stores open due to sickness wouldn't have the exact, if not worse, permanence on closure of mom and p op stores, or homeless families, careers derailed (turned into graves instead)... 

Letting this pandemic rage out of control happened before, 100 years ago, the Spanish flu, another strain of influenza/coronavirus, it infected (estimated) 500 MILLION people, and killed anywhere between 10, and 50 million people... 

We do NOT want that to happen again. 

Keep in mind, back in 1920, there were 1.8 Billion people on the planet, that's a 30% infection rate. those numbers now... you'd have 2.2 Billion people dead, and with a  10-30% mortality rate, well, 200,000,000 to 600,000,000 deaths... that's a HUGE amount of dead people... yeah, careers, families, businesses would have huge problems.

Want to know what followed WWI, and the influenza pandemic? The great depression, hundreds of thousands more died due to starvation, suicide, and crime, as the economy was utterly destroyed.

So, yeah, Between the choice of a repeat of the 1920 influenza pandemic, and the great depression, and spending a bunch of money to ensure people stay safe and the death count stays low... isn't a choice at all, you spend the money, and make sure we don't have a repeat of 100 years ago."

""new coronavirus discovered in china


A new corona virus has been found amongst people in china who visited a market in the city of Wuhan. FHM asses the risk for the infection to reach sweden as very low (Scale ""very low"")

The source to the infection has yet to be identified but the market has been closed since januari 1st. A total of a few hundreds cases  has been reported in China with symtops of airway fever and coughing. A few cases of death has been reported as well, in casees the patient had another serious underlying health issue. As the incubationtime for coronavirus is 2-14 days the risk for new cases reduces successively.""

Then it goes aon about it being reported from other countries with connection to Wuhan. It being a virus of the corona family. That generally those viruses only cause mild infections with humans but that sars and mers also is part of hte family and has more serious complications. 

..."" There are yet any sure evidences of transmission from human to human""
- For it to be a large outbreak, the virus needs to be good atr spreading from human to human. It would seem not to be this case. Says state epidemiolog Anders Tegnell.

WHO has not decreedd any particular recommendations for travellers but that people who visited Wuhan and experience coughing and fever should seek healthcare. Also the health care system shoudl be aware.

- That the health care system aroudn the world is observant is important to both discover new cases, lower the risk for transmission and increase the knowledge of the virus, says Anders Tegnell.

FHM follows closesely the situation of events but assesses the risk for cases in sweden as ""very low"". In the cases people who visited wuhan contacts health care with symptoms , FHM h as possibility to do diagnositic analyses to discover the actual virus.

END TRANSLATION


ok, soi while hindsight he was wrong, he never said it wouldn't reach sweden. Instead the FHM publicated information of a virus on the other side of the globe, that not many had even paid attention to yet (WHO didnt even do any recommendations). 
At the time it was rather prudent to make the assessment they did. 


Was he wrong, is swedish citizens dying? yes ofc, but going hindsight 20/20 saying he was wrong is really just painting with way too few colours to even make sense"

Chinese Journal of Epidemiology 2020 Expert group from Chinese Preventive Medicine Association on prevention and control of Novel Coronavirus Pneumonia. Chinese Journal of Viral Diseases 2020 COVID-19 patients with underlying disease have high mortality More than 75% of patients who die of COVID-19 have more than one underlying disease such as cardiovascular and cerebrovascular disease, diabetes, respiratory infectious disease, hypertension and cancer. Age ≥75 years, acute infectious diseases (especially severe infections or sepsis), respiratory failure, heart failure (New York heart function class III or IV), obesity (body mass index ≥30 kg/m2), previous VTE medical history, acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, acute cerebral infarction, acute coronary syndrome, varicose veins of the lower limbs, malignant tumour, inflammatory bowel disease, chronic kidney disease. Advanced age is an independent risk factor for VTE. More than 60% of VTE incidents occur in seniors over 65. Caprini risk assessment model is recommended for gravida or parturient, if infected with COVID-19, and combined the following risk factors concurrently: immobilization, VTE history, preeclampsia or intrauterine growth retardation, thrombophilia, blood transfusion, postpartum infection, supervene with systemic lupus erythematosus, heart disease, and sickle cell anemia, etc., suggesting higher VTE risk exists; other risk factors include obesity, polycyesis, and postpartum hemorrhage, etc. Pulmonary Embolism and Pulmonary Vascular Disease Group, Respiratory Medicine Branch, Chinese Medical Association et al. Overall assessment, including underlying diseases, laboratory tests, combined medications, and invasive procedures should be performed to patients before preventive measures are taken. Be wary of prior : (1) Active hemorrhage, such as uncontrolled gastrointestinal ulcers, hemorrhagic disease, etc.; (2) Previous history of intracranial hemorrhage or other hemorrhoea; (3) Uncontrolled hypertension, SBP > 180 mmHg and/or DBP > 110 mmHg; (4) Intracranial diseases that may cause severe bleeding, such as acute stroke (within 3 months), severe brain or acute spinal cord Injury; (5) Diabetes; (6) Malignant tumour; (7) Severe renal failure or liver failure, etc.

Much of what you are suggesting has already happened. This is how you destroy cities.

That's not true. Suburbs levy their own taxes to pay for their own services. And in many cases, suburbs have lower costs of government than the cities they surround. And cities are supposed to be a means to an end, not an end in themselves, so if they get destroyed, it means they no longer serve a purpose.

>If you thinking living in the ever expanding suburbs is sustainable and healthy then Phoenix is your place. As far as the eye can see, the same thing repeats every five blocks. Strip mall grocery, Home Depot, Olive Garden, freeway interchange.

Phoenix has gone from being a barren desert to the 5th largest city in America in just over 70 years for a reason. It's ironic you complain about big box stores, because those were an urban invention, starting with the great big department stores in Chicago and New York.

(Rightly so.) 

No, that's not fair. The accusation is that this is being spread somewhat artificially at too fast of a rate.

> While I personally tend to give far more credence to accusers than the accused, you *can* call the timing of an accusation and the veracity of the person making those claims into question *without* being misogynistic. And you *should*. (The Crucible and all that.)

Incorrect. That's part of rape culture: knee-jerk relying on these ridiculous tropes to reject a woman's story. That's the whole point of \#BelieveWomen: stop feeding into those tropes.

MAGAs did this with every accuser. Be better than them.

Concerning ""timing"", there is never a ""good time"" to come forward and nobody gets to dictate when a victim comes forward. People tend to come forward exactly when it is ""inconvenient"" for the accused in these situations because one of the reasons women come forward is that they're worried that person will get more power. In this particular case, those complaining about timing are using as a knee-jerk trope, ignoring that she's been trying to get this out, with legal protection, since Sanders was in the lead and Warren was still in the race.

> Speaking as a woman here, the mere fact of my gender doesn't automatically make something I say true, that'd be absurd.

Please review \#BelieveWomen because the idea you're rejecting is a common trope that misrepresents the movement.

> The fact someone is female also doesn't mean they can't have a political (or personal) agenda.

Nobody has said this.

The damage is in the knee-jerk rejection and tropes used to deny women room to be taken seriously.

> (A lot of ""feminists"" have a way of tacitly suggesting that. For me that that feels even more dismissive than their counterparts who seem to think a woman couldn't possibly be telling the truth. Where the latter are clearly idiots, I find the former more insidious because it purports to be on my side.)

Those people are fake woke liberals. They never understood what any of this was really about and they're the same people that tried to treat Warren's accusation against Sanders as if it were a \#MeToo moment.

> I don't know what happened with Biden and Reade here. I'm far from making up my mind either way.

That's fine nobody is demanding that you not withhold judgment.

> But truth isn't served by discouraging honest discussions of a thing, and cries of ""misogyny"" to silence opposing opinions are almost as bad as some of the actual misogyny out there.

They absolutely are not and the tropes I'm contending with are absolutely misogyny. There's a very special set of tropes that our culture uses to silence women and in recent history they've been on display by MAGAs. Now it's Democrats.

> It should be okay to discuss this.

Without knee-jerk dismissive tropes, sure.

> We *have* to, or we're opening ourselves up to election manipulations that completely eclipse not counting the votes in Florida or Gerrymandering or un-registering voters etc.

This is just absurd.

> It's not misogynistic; it's the responsible thing to do.

Go look at the tropes I'm referring to. Go review Republicans' arguments against Dr. Christine Blasey-Ford."

On March 8th my company announced that they want us to start working from home since we have a very large campus and two people tested positive for coronavirus. My first thought was that I was going to leave for Egypt the next day. But as you know it is not a good time to travel

> Concerning smoking and COVID-19, our data showed a pooled prevalence of 9% current smokers, (95% CI, 4%–14%), lower than the reported prevalence of smoking in China that was 25.2% (25.1–25.4) (52). Interestingly, we found that 22.30% (31/139) of current smokers and 46% (13/28) of ex-smokers had severe complications associated and greater mortality reaching 38.5% in current smokers.

There are very few smokers (5-10%) but the ones who still do get sick have worse outcomes. We knew this long ago:

> Note that the data also suggests that smokers who do get ill may more often have severe illness. https://old.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/faluhv/an_exhaustive_lit_search_shows_that_only_585_sars/

They also missed some papers, my list there is more exhaustive. Also, data is accumulating to confirm that COPD and asthma are also rare:

> However, chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases (COPD) are relatively less common in COVID-19 patients, with a prevalence of 1.1%-2.9%. 7-9 In a study involving 140 cases with COVID-19 on the association between allergies and infection, no patients were found to have asthma or allergic rhinitis. 8 […] Given the association between virus infection and asthma, 30 it is worth carefully monitoring asthmatic patients in this coronavirus epidemic. However, in pediatric cases, we did not find COVID-19 patients with a history of asthma (unpublished data). Maybe a distinct type 2 immune response may contribute to this low prevalence of asthma and allergy patients in COVID-19. The interaction between SARS-CoV-2 and asthma remains to be further investigated, especially considering that current medical resources have been mostly focused on COVID-19. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32196678

So people with preexisting respiratory issues are very rarely COVID-19 patients. Smokers are one subset."

Also, you're looking at a bad flu year, not necessarily a normal one.  

One missing piece is the death rate.  We don't even know what that is yet, but it is believed to be many times higher that for the flu, even accounting for the lack of good testing.  Of course, a lot of people get the flu and don't get tested, but scientists can make estimates and come up with at least a range for each.  The director of WHO said earlier this month:  ""Globally, about 3.4% of reported COVID-19 cases have died. By comparison, seasonal flu generally kills far fewer than 1% of those infected.""

Also, we are still in the early stages of this pandemic.  It's still increasing at an increasing rate, and could easily surpass the flu numbers if we under-react.

Why all the ""religious freedom"" laws that restrict rights to other religions or the non-religious? Why try to take away people's healthcare? Why try to close all the abortion clinics? Why loosen all the environmental safeguards? Why loosen the financial safeguards that were put in place after the bailouts of 2008? 

The way I see it, Democrats are trying to fight for a better future for EVERYONE. Healthcare for all, better environment, free education for your children, equal rights and liberties for ALL (women, children, minorities, lgbtq, etc). Hell.. even AOC fought to get MORE directly to the people in this coronavirus bill.. and yet she's still getting shit for it. She wants MORE money to go to the people.

* Having dismantled the NSC pandemic response unit
* Not aggressively testing early on
* Not addressing inadequate testing capacity
* Not having stockpiled vital medical equipment, 
* Invoking the Defense Production Act but not actually exercising its powers such that the states have to bid against each other as well as the federal government for said vital medical equipment
* Not directing said the vital medical equipment to those states whose governor are critical of him and/or don't laud him with praise
* His overall slowness to treat this as a crisis early even though he had warnings coming at him from all directions
* His push to have businesses re-open by Easter,  with workers put ting themselves at risk even though the pandemic has shown no signs of abating."

This could potentially be dangerous for myself or little one, So before you take this flight please bare in mind the following points:

- We will not be picking you up at the airport which will be a hotspot for the virus.

- we will not allow you to take a step into our home

- we will not visit you or see you for the duration on your trip

- and finally , should you decide to break our trust and not listen to our clear orders  And attempt to put any of us in danger our relationship with you will be dramatically changed and I promise you when I say it will not be mended under any circumstances

My mother, who voted for Obama in 2008 (& maybe even 2012, not sure, though) is now a card carrying MAGA fan. She (and my father) are serial sharers on Facebook. Anything related to Trump, Republicans, or how bad/dumb/greedy/entitled liberals are gets an automatic share without any attempt to read or validate the information. My father loves to play the smartest person in the room card, so I laughed when a number of years ago, he said that the show 24 casting a female as the president was just FOX trying to suck up to Hillary Clinton. I had a great laugh at that one. I also laughed when he sent me the picture going around that said gargling salt water would kill the coronavirus. Recently, he said that the stimulus bill was being held up because Nancy Pelosi wanted money for abortions. My father’s motto has always been, “don’t let anyone shit on you.” A fine motto, but he uses that to look at the world as one big place full of people trying to screw him over or people who are given things and opportunities without working for them. He’s shown no symptoms of COVID, he goes out to the grocery store, Walmart, etc. regularly, but demands that when tests are available, he should have priority because he’s 71. I can’t say this all started with Fox Noise, as I’m fairly certain it started with Rush Limbaugh, but FN has definitely been added to the rotation and he loves everything they have to say. It must be exciting and add some fun to one’s life when the news you watch makes it seem like you’re some hero in a story, only outranked by the hero in the White House, surrounded on all sides by people looking to harm and exploit you and the ones you love. This is a guy who, when he has a cold, buys Walmart-brand allergy medicine because there’s no way he’s “getting screwed out of money for Mucinex.” I love my father because he wasn’t always like this and I realize he’s just scared and anxious all the time, but the guy I once respected and looked forward to spending time with is long gone."
2020-03-28,smallworldspark,Coronavirus,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/fqqkmg/how_genetic_mutations_turned_the_coronavirus/flrmnoj/,"*Two critical mutations in the bat coronavirus set us on the path to the COVID-19 pandemic. The first modified the structure of the spike-like structures that protrude from the virus. Those protrusions give the virus its family name: “Corona” means “crown” in Latin. The altered spikes allow the virus to latch onto a protein called ACE2, which lines the respiratory tract. The related virus responsible for the SARS epidemic employs a similar infection mechanism, as does another bat coronavirus that causes common colds in humans.*

*The second key mutation allowed the coronavirus to grow a protein dagger called a furin, which can slice through other proteins to make the virus bind tightly to throat and lung cells. The furin protein is what made the COVID-19 virus so infectious and deadly to humans. In that sense, SARS-CoV-2 is similar to anthrax and various bird flus that also rely on furins to carry out their infection.*"
