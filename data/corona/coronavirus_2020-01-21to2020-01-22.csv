2020-01-21,LatePiezoelectricity,China_Flu,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/China_Flu/comments/es21aq/wuhan_pneumonia_survivor_my_22_day_battle_against/ff7apok/,"As of midnight, Jan 20, there are in total 291 confirmed cases of pneumonia caused by the novel Coronavirus in 4 domestic provinces, districts, and cities according to National Health Committee (270 in Hubei, 5 in Beijing, 14 in Guangdong, 2 in Shanghai); 54 suspected cases in 14 provinces, districts, and cities (11 in Hubei, 7 in Guangdong, 3 in Sichuan, 1 in Yunnan, 7 in Shanghai, 1 in Guangxi, 1 in Shandong, 1 in Jilin, 1 in Anhui, 16 in Zhejiang, 2 in Jiangxi, 1 in Hainan, 1 in Guizhou, 1 in Ningxia).

On Jan 20, Zhong Nanshan, leader of high-level expert team of National Health Committee, member of Chinese Academy of Engineering, director of National Clinical Research Center for Respiratory Disease, expressed that based on the geological distribution and affected demographics, this virus outbreak is closely related to the seafood market in Wuhan. The most effective method to contain the outbreak is to discover, diagnose, and quarantine as soon as possible.

At the moment, Wang Kang, who was treated at Jinyintan Hospital, has been released. In between feeling discomfort on Dec 24, 2019 and being released from hospital on Jan 15, he was transferred twice, had his blood oxygen level drop to critical, and eventually diagnosed and cured at Jinyintan Hospital. Shenyidu had a conversation with Wangkang, in the hope of reconstructing the discovery and treatment process of early patients infected by the novel coronavirus."

I am not an expert, but i read a lot when these things pop up. Ebola is easier to treat and contain, the main reason for its large death rate is the disease is almost exclusive to 3rd world countries that hard a hard time treating and managing outbreaks until the WHO/other orgs step in. 

Coronavirus on the other hand is not easy to treat or to contain - ebola is spread through bodily fluids and corona through the air and the worst strains cause lower respiratory infections, bad pneumonia."
2020-01-21,williambotter,brasilnoticias,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/brasilnoticias/comments/ertsvj/el_nuevo_virus_chino_se_contagia_entre_humanos/ff5smxp/," La Organización Mundial de la Salud (OMS) ha convocado este lunes un comité de emergencia ante el avance del nuevo **[coronavirus de Wuhan](//elpais.com/tag/ncov/a)**. Se reunirá el miércoles para determinar si supone una urgencia internacional, para hacer recomendaciones y buscar soluciones a su amenaza. La decisión llega tras la confirmación de las autoridades chinas de que se puede transmitir entre personas, algo que hace más peligrosa la enfermedad. Hasta ahora, ha causado cuatro víctimas mortales, la última, confirmada este martes, un hombre de 89 años fallecido el domingo por esta extraña enfermedad. Corea del Sur confirmó este lunes su primer caso. Mientras, las autoridades australianas investigan un posible caso en la ciudad de Brisbane, de un hombre que viajó recientemente a la ciudad china y que ha sido puesto en cuarentena tras mostrar síntomas de enfermedad respiratoria.

 “El reciente brote de una nueva neumonía por coronavirus en Wuhan y otros lugares debe tomarse en serio”, ha dicho este lunes el presidente de la República Popular China, Xi Jinping, en su primera declaración pública sobre la crisis. ""Los comités del partido, los gobiernos y los departamentos relevantes en todos los niveles deben poner en primer lugar la vida y la salud de las personas"".

 Es un virus nuevo, del que solo se tiene constancia desde hace 20 días, así que todavía es mucho lo que se desconoce de él. Los científicos estudian sus características y su expansión. Esto es lo que se sabe hasta el momento.

 ### ¿Cuántos afectados hay?

 Pese a que las autoridades de Wuhan aseguraban hasta el viernes que desde el 3 de enero no había nuevas infecciones, la realidad es que no paran de crecer. Según los últimos datos oficiales hay 198 casos confirmados en el municipio, lo que multiplica prácticamente por tres la cifra que se había hecho pública la semana pasada. Según un comunicado emitido este martes por la Comisión Municipal de Salud de Wuhan, 25 han sanado mientras que 169 continúan hospitalizados en aislamiento y siguen recibiendo tratamiento médico. De ellos, 35 se encuentran en estado grave y nueve en estado crítico. Frente a las cifras oficiales, un estudio del Centro de Análisis de Enfermedades Infecciosas Globales del [Imperial College de Londres](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/) estimaba que, a fecha del 12 de enero, el número de infecciones probables se elevaba a 1.723. “Es probable que el brote de un nuevo coronavirus en Wuhan haya causado una cantidad de enfermedades respiratorias leves o moderadas sustancialmente mayor de la que se ha ofrecido”, rezaba el texto, producido con apoyo de la OMS.

 ### ¿Cuáles son los síntomas?

 Provoca síntomas similares a los de una neumonía, ocasionando fiebre y dificultades respiratorias, aunque dependiendo de la persona afectada pueden ser muy leves, graves o incluso mortales.

 ### ¿Es mortal?

 Hasta el momento se han registrado cuatro muertes causadas por el 2019-nCov, el nombre oficial del patógeno. Se conocen detalles de las dos primeras, que afectaron a hombres, de 61 y 69 años respectivamente. Ambos padecían enfermedades pulmonares previas y perecieron por las complicaciones derivadas de la infección. También del último, un hombre de 89 años que desarrolló los síntomas de la nueva neumonía el día 13, fue hospitalizado el 18 y murió el domingo. El antecedente más directo que existe es el [SARS](//elpais.com/tag/sars/a), de la misma familia. También nació en China y causó en 2002 la muerte de más de 700 personas. Fue mortal en aproximadamente un 10% de los casos, ensañándose especialmente entre los mayores de 65 años. Aunque los científicos trabajan en desentrañar su secuencia, *a priori* creen que no es tan grave.

 ### ¿Cómo surgió?

 Los coronavirus son microorganismos que mutan con facilidad. Se sospecha que saltaron a los humanos desde un mercado de animales vivos en la localidad de Wuhan, ya que la inmensa mayoría de los primeros pacientes habían estado allí. Es probable que el virus pasase de un huésped primario, como un murciélago, a otra especie por alguna adaptación o mutación, y que en otra posterior, en su contacto con personas, llegase a ellas.

 ### ¿Cómo se transmite?

 En principio se suponía que solo podía pasar de animales a humanos, igual que otro patógeno conocido de la misma familia: el MERS-CoV. Pero las autoridades chinas confirmaron el lunes que puede contagiarse entre personas, algo que se venía sospechando tras detectar cada vez más casos de infectados que no pasaron por el mercado.

 ### ¿Hay riesgo de pandemia?

 A falta de conocer las conclusiones de la reunión que la OMS mantendrá el miércoles, en sus evaluaciones previas había catalogado el riesgo de expansión como alto dentro del país, moderado en la región y bajo globalmente. En China ya ha llegado a Pekín y a Shenzhen, cerca de Hong Kong. Existen rumores, asimismo, de que se han identificado varios casos sospechosos en Shanghái. Así lo exponía un doctor de uno de los principales hospitales de la ciudad en declaraciones anónimas al diario hongkonés *South China Morning Post*: “Nuestro centro está llevando a cabo sesiones de entrenamiento sobre prevención y tratamiento del virus. También se están apresurando las compras de máscaras, gorros y desinfectantes. Siendo sincero, estoy asustado. Es un nuevo virus con muchos aspectos que todavía no están claros”.

 ### ¿A qué países ha llegado?

 Ya ha cruzado tres fronteras: se ha detectado en Tailandia, Japón y Corea del Sur. De momento todos los pacientes habían pasado por Wuhan. Australia investiga un posible caso de un hombre que había viajado a la ciudad china, y que ha sido puesto en cuarentena. Los funcionarios de frontera y de bioseguridad realizarán inspecciones médicas a los pasajeros que lleguen en los tres vuelos semanales desde Wuhan a Sídney."

Most people will only suffer symptoms of a bad cold, but compromised individuals with poor immune systems may develop pneumonia or other serious respiratory problems that could result in death. MERS & SARS are in the Corona Virus Family. To sum up, if you’re in good health you likely would only experience symptoms like a bad cold. 
Best way to not get it-wash hands frequently and avoid contact with infected individuals.

The Virus is about 70% similiar to SARS, and as a coronavirus, is spread in a form similiar to the flu, via close contact with carriers via airborne methods, and contact with an infected surface, followed by contact with a mucus membrane.  

The virus has now been confirmed to have spread through multiple Chinese cities, and into neighboring countries, including Thailand, Japan, and I believe there have been recent cases in Korea.  These are confirmed cases, with symptoms.

My point about symptoms is that early infection cannot be detected, and the contagious phase peaks in the second week, from what is currently known.   
 So while the airport scans might pick up someone actively sick, they will not pick up carriers who are not yet showing systems.

I don't know about the methodology for the British calculations, but the way in which they are presented is the same as what the Chinese are presenting, it is simply a matter that the numbers don't match.  Given past Chinese activities regarding various health outbreaks (both in humans and in other areas, like livestock), I am inclined to find the British numbers more realistic.

Finally, I am not from Hong Kong, I simply have interests in China, and so keep track on various contacts and events there.  Though given how China is treating HK at the moment, I imagine I would be pretty anti-China is I lives there."

Think of your DNA and RNA as the software in the cell.  This software tells the cell how to divide and grow, how to make certain proteins, and many other things.  The virus comes in and reprograms this software for no other reason than to make more copies.

The coronavirus enters the body through the air or by food and water.  If it's the air, it will attack the cells in your lungs.  Your lungs become vulnerable if the infection spreads, leading to pneumonia.  This can cause your lungs to be damaged, reducing the amount of oxygen your body gets and can fluid to build up in your lungs.  This fluid can also hinder your ability to breathe and effectively drown you.  If it enters by food or drink, the virus attacks the cells in your gut, leading to symptoms that one might call food poisoning.  This leads to severe dehydration and malnutrition.  Without the water and nutrients the body needs, your body starts to shut down to save the brain, leading to organ failure and potentially death."

Coronaviruses are usually species-specific so we are dealing with a new strain of a well-known foe.  Moreover, this suggests that there is no animal reservoir (it may have come from a bat coronavirus, but these cross-species events are very rare), so if we can limit human-to-human transmission, we can stop this before it gets out of hand.

We already know how to make effective vaccines for coronavirus in dogs, so it should be easy to develop one against this virus for use in humans."

>Zhong Nanshan, a respiratory expert and head of the national health commission team investigating the outbreak, confirmed that two cases of infection in China’s Guangdong province had been caused by human-to-human transmission and medical staff had been infected, China’s official Xinhua news agency said on Monday.

If medical staff have come down with it, then it's reasonable to question how ""close"" the contact needs to be (per the WHO's statement that there's some limited transmission noted from ""close contact""). And if Wuhan has 100+ patients actually waiting in the ER, it doesn't sound like it's all that limited."

The spread of the Spanish Flu in 1918 wasn't due to WW1 itself, but due to the end of it... Soldiers from all over the world were being shipped back home from Europe, often carrying the disease (I think it first popped up in Kansas actually, but I'm not sure). 

It was spread because of the ease of movement of large groups of people across the world, a condition that has only improved since then. 1918-1921 was before the era of commercial air-travel which is universally ubiquitous today. We are living in the best possible time for a virus to jump the species barrier and infect people around the world due to how interconnected our world is through global transportation networks... air, sea, and land.

SARS took five months from first emerging in Guangdong Province, China, in November 2002, before it began spreading internationally in February of 2003...

The Wuhan Coronavirus, as of today, took roughly three weeks from being first detected to spreading internationally including to the US. 

What we know is that the Wuhan virus is communicable from person to person, but we don't know how, and how transmissible it is... For instance, in 2002 one man with SARS who stayed on the 9th floor of a hotel in Kowloon ended up infecting 16 people total. A transmissibility rate that high is startling but not unheard of for a novel zoonotic corona-virus, as people don't have any immunity towards that brand new pathogen yet.

&#x200B;

We are still unfortunately in the early days of this outbreak, and the disease has a hell of a head start already. Luckily, it hasn't proven to be too fatal just yet with only 6 fatalities. It can further mutate, and likely will, but that has just as much of a chance of making it less severe as it does to make it more severe."

**Article**:

> About 300 people have been diagnosed in an outbreak linked to a new virus in China. The illnesses began late last month in the city of Wuhan in central China, and six people have died. Scientists have identified the illness as a new kind of coronavirus. Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses, some of which cause the common cold. Others have evolved into more severe illnesses, such as SARS and MERS, though so far the new virus does not appear to be nearly as deadly.

- It's not bad yet, and probably won't be that bad, it only has 291 cases confirmed so far and six deaths blamed on it.  It's similar to SARS which killed 600 in China and 100 around the world.  For comparison the Ebola outbreak in West Africa killed 11,300 in West Africa in 2014-2016.  The CDC estimated that the flu has infected over 13 Million people and killed 6,600 in just the fall/winter of 2019-2020.
- It's basically a more severe headcold, with shortness of breath, fever, coughing, headache, upset stomach, and potentially pneumonia.  It's similar to SARS from 2002-03 and MERS.
- It's likely zoonautic (transmitted by animals) but I don't think that's been confirmed.  They have confirmed human to human transmission likely via coughing.
- I don't think other countries are worried, but obviously they're on the lookout for any concentration of cases.

The TLDR is it's not that concerning, if you have trouble breathing or fever over 100 degrees for 24 hours you should seek medical attention, it's most deadly to young, elderly, and immunocompromised.  It could become more concerning if it spreads a lot more rapidly or the death toll starts rising.  The flu is much more of a real threat to anyone in the US/EU.

1. This coronavirus is less contagious than the influenza virus (and also most likely than SARS).
2. People most likely become infected if they live with someone who is infected with it or they are a healthcare staff member taking care of someone who has it.
3. It is less deadly than influenza.
4. All viruses come and go... in other words, these viruses naturally die after some time. The chances of you getting it are low. You are much more likely to catch a cold or the flu.

1. Sleep 7-8 hours each night.
2. Exercise throughout the week.
3. Drink enough water; stay hydrated.
4. Clean your hands before eating.
5. Try to eat healthy.
6. Try to enjoy each moment that you can.

All of these will keep your immune system going healthy. 💜"

> WASHINGTON: The United States on Tuesday (Jan 21) announced its first case of a new virus that has claimed six lives in China and sickened hundreds, joining countries around the world in ramping up measures to block its spread.

> The man, a US resident in his 30s who lives near Seattle, is in good condition, according to federal and state officials, and approached authorities himself after reading about the SARS-like virus in news reports.

> Advertisement

> He is ""currently hospitalised out of an abundance of precaution, and for short term monitoring, not because there was severe illness,"" said Chris Spitters, a Washington state health official.

> ""This is an evolving situation and again, we do expect additional patients in the United States and globally,"" added Nancy Messonier, a senior official at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). She stressed that the overall risk to Americans remained low.

> The man is originally from Wuhan and returned to the US on Jan 15, two days before health officials began screening passengers at major airports arriving from the central Chinese city, which is at the heart of the outbreak. The efforts are to be extended now to a total of five US airports.

> He lives alone and will be monitored in isolation for at least 48 more hours.

> Advertisement

> Advertisement

> ""This is not a moment of high anxiety,"" Washington Governor Jay Inslee told reporters at a press conference in Seattle, adding that the man was listed in satisfactory condition at Providence Regional Medical Center in Everett, Washington and not known to have infected anyone else.

> ""This is a low risk. It appears to have a transmission vector that really should not prevent anyone from going anywhere in Snohomish County, except maybe the isolation ward at the hospital,"" Inslee said.

> The development came as countries intensified their efforts to stop the spread of the pathogen - known by its technical name 2019 Novel Coronavirus - as the number of cases surpassed 300, raising concerns in the middle of a major Chinese holiday travel rush.

> Factfile on the coronavirus family, which circulate in animals and can be transmitted to humans. A new strain of this virus has been identified in Wuhan, China. (AFP)

> Fears of a bigger outbreak rose after a prominent expert from China's National Health Commission confirmed late on Monday that the virus can be passed between people.

> That conclusion is shared by the CDC, which said ""person-to-person spread is occurring, although it's unclear how easily the virus spreads between people.""

> The World Health Organisation (WHO) will hold an emergency meeting on Wednesday to determine whether to declare a rare global public health emergency over the disease, which has also been detected in Thailand, Japan and South Korea and Taiwan.

> Many experts believe the US case, while not surprising given the frequency of international flights, makes such a declaration all the more likely.

> Mark Woolhouse, a professor of infectious disease epidemiology at the University of Edinburgh, said more evidence was needed to determine if it spreads through the air or via close human-to-human contact.

> ""It is important to stress that, though similar, it is not as severe an infection as its predecessor, the SARS coronavirus,"" he added.

> HOLIDAY RUSH

> Early on, many patients had some link to a Wuhan seafood market where live animals were sold, suggesting an animal-to-person spread.

> Hundreds of millions of people are criss-crossing China this week in packed buses, trains and planes to celebrate the Lunar New Year with relatives.

> More than 80 new cases have been confirmed, bringing the total number of people hit by the virus in China to 315, with the vast majority in Hubei, the province where Wuhan lies, according to officials.

> But cases have also been confirmed around the country, including Beijing and Shanghai.

> The first case on the self-ruled island of Taiwan was also confirmed on Tuesday, with a woman taken to hospital on arrival at the airport from Wuhan.

> Taiwan's Centre for Disease Control (CDC) personnel (right) using thermal scanners to screen passengers arriving on a flight from China's Wuhan province. (Chen Chi-chuan/AFP)

> Wuhan mayor Zhou Xianwang told state broadcaster CCTV on Tuesday that the death toll had risen from four to six.

> The coronavirus has caused alarm because of its genetic similarities to Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), which killed nearly 650 people across mainland China and Hong Kong in 2002-2003.

> FEVER CHECKS

> At four airports in Thailand, authorities introduced mandatory thermal scans of passengers arriving from high-risk areas of China.

> In Hong Kong, authorities said they were on ""extreme high alert,"" with passengers from Wuhan required to fill out health declarations and face possible jail time if they do not declare symptoms.

> Enhanced screening measures have also been set up at airports in Australia, Bangladesh, Nepal, Singapore and Russia, Malaysia and Vietnam.

> A man showing symptoms of the disease who had travelled to Wuhan has been put in isolation in Australia as health officials await test results, authorities said on Tuesday.

> In China, the government announced it was classifying the outbreak in the same category as SARS, meaning compulsory isolation for those diagnosed with the disease and the potential to implement quarantine measures on travel.

> In Wuhan, authorities banned tour groups and police were conducting spot checks for animals in vehicles leaving and entering the city, state media said.

> Passengers were being screened for fever at the airport, railway stations and bus terminals.

> Doctors at the University of Hong Kong released a study on Tuesday estimating that there have been 1,343 cases of the new virus in Wuhan.

> The WHO has only called a global public health emergency a handful of times, including during the H1N1 - or swine flu - pandemic of 2009 and the Ebola epidemic that devastated parts of West Africa from 2014 to 2016.

*     headache
*     cough
*     sore throat
*     fever

If you culture the virus you then kill it using various methods. Then you start trying things out. If your going for a vaccine you need an animal that you can infect with the virus,  which can be pretty hard. You try different combinations of pieces, ways to kill the virus, and adjuvants (additives that make the vaccine work better). If you can induce immunity in the animal then you start the process of safety testing in other animals, and eventually human safety and efficacy trials. 

Add for treatments, there are a few broadly acting antiviral medications. Peggalated interferon, and sometimes ribavirin. But if you want to make a drug specific to Coronavirus you pick a protien that the virus uses but our bodies don't. Then you try out many, many chemicals to find one that gums up the works of that protein. Then you go through all the animal testing to see if it might work and be safe to use. Then comes the human testing and maybe with a lot of stubbornness and a big heap of luck you end up with a drug."

However, while little is known about the new virus, progress to contain it has been fast and there’s little to actually be scared about right now. 


“The new [coronavirus] so far does not appear to be as deadly as SARS and MERS, but viruses can sometimes mutate to become more dangerous.

University of Washington coronavirus researcher David Veesler said the public ‘should not be panicking right now.’

The response has been ‘very efficient,’ Veesler said. ‘In a couple of weeks, China was able to identify the virus, isolate it, sequence it and share that information.’

Veesler added: ‘We don’t have enough data to judge how severe the disease is.’”

Swine flu when it flared up was initially quite aggressive interms of people dying, but as it spread history shows it mutated into a more infectious but less virulent form.

The best we can hope for here is that if it does get going is that in order to become more infectious the coronavirus looses some of its lethality along the way

And no doubt the infection rate (those who are infected and get better) is more than likely much higher as well, so the % death toll per 1000 infected could be a lot less than officially reported, but the amount of people infected could be much higher"

> SINGAPORE - With more people infected by the mysterious Wuhan virus and the bug spreading further, the Ministry of Health (MOH) said on Tuesday (Jan 21) that it is taking more precautionary measures.

> This comes just a day after the ministry said it was expanding temperature screening to all inbound travellers arriving at Changi Airport from China, instead of just those from the Chinese city of Wuhan earlier.

> The ministry said that in the light of China's health commission confirming on Monday that the coronavirus responsible for causing pneumonia in Wuhan can be transmitted between people, MOH is widening its isolation measures.

> Previously, only people with fever and pneumonia who had travelled to Wuhan within two weeks of their symptoms starting were isolated.

> But from Wednesday, those with pneumonia who have travelled to any part of China within two weeks of showing symptoms will also be subjected to isolation measures. Pneumonia symptoms include fever, coughing and breathing difficulties.

> In addition, isolation measures will likewise apply to those with acute respiratory infection who have been to any hospital in China within two weeks of showing symptoms, which may include a sore throat or body aches.

> This is a precautionary measure to prevent transmission of the virus, the ministry said.

> Isolation measures are used to restrict the contact of ill people with the healthy, while quarantine measures apply to people who are well and may have been exposed to the disease.

> People who are quarantined may have been exposed to a disease and do not know it, or they may have the disease but do not show symptoms, according to the United States Department of Health and Services.

> On Tuesday, MOH identified a seventh suspect case - a 44-year-old Singapore resident who has pneumonia and had recently been to Wuhan. She and the previous six suspected cases have tested negatively for the virus, going by the MOH's latest updates.

> The ministry said that although there have been no confirmed cases here so far, it expects to see more suspected cases and even imported cases ""given the high volume of international travel to Singapore"".

> ""Once a case is confirmed, contact tracing will be initiated, and we will implement strict isolation, quarantine, and infection control and prevention measures to prevent further transmission,"" it said.

> Related Story Wuhan virus and Sars are as different as cat and dog, researchers say

> Related Story Wuhan virus: A timeline of how the new coronavirus developed

> A total of 291 Wuhan virus cases have been reported in China, with a sixth fatality reported on Tuesday.

> Earlier, cases were centred around Wuhan, but they have spread to Beijing and the southern Chinese province of Guangdong.

> More than 900 people are still under medical observation, according to China’s National Health Commission, even as South Korea, Thailand and Japan confirmed their first cases in recent days.

> Health experts have said that the Wuhan virus is likely not as infectious as the Sars virus, which killed almost 800 people 17 years ago. But they said under-reporting means more than 1,700 people in Wuhan could have already been infected with the disease.

> Initially, the virus was thought to only transmit from animals to humans. However, the virus has infected at least 15 medical workers in Wuhan, confirming that the pathogen is being passed on among humans.

> MOH warned travellers and members of the public to avoid contact with live animals and not to eat raw and undercooked meats in the meantime.

> People should also observe good personal hygiene, wear a mask when they have a cough or runny nose, and see a doctor promptly if they feel unwell, the ministry said.

Not all cells express the same receptors. This difference is why rhinovirus (cold virus) hits your respiratory tract but not your liver. 

Because all species have different receptors, viruses tend to be species specific. For example, measles is human only, and swine flu is (mostly) pig only. However, some viruses target similar enough receptors on different species so that it can jump species. Usually this occurs with enough random mutations and proximity with the other species. The virus goes from being animal-to-human to being human-to-human, which is what I think you're asking.

Hell, they even recognized the possibility of much higher estimates by foreign sources being true as the numbers we have now are only 'confirmed' (确诊）cases that are inherently lagging behind real time infection rates, since y'know, they need to be _confirmed._

Not to say China is not capable of or willing to cover this up since the last time this happened they tried to kick out the WHO team sent to investigate, but so far WHO and international researchers seem to be cooperating fine with the local researchers on the disease.

The incubation period for SARS is estimated to be 1 to 14 days with a median of 4 to 5 days. The incubation period for MERS is usually 5 or 6 days, but it can range from 2 to 14 days.

&nbsp;

>The median incubation period for secondary cases associated with limited human-to-human transmission is approximately 5 days (range 2-14 days). In MERS-CoV patients, the median time from illness onset to hospitalization is approximately 4 days. In critically ill patients, the median time from onset to intensive care unit (ICU) admission is approximately 5 days, and median time from onset to death is approximately 12 days.


As an educated guess at the usual median of other types of Coronavirus closely related to 2019-nCoV, incubation period should be 3-7 days. Numbers must be lagging behind by a big amount.

A coronavirus is a type of virus which typically causes minor respiratory issues akin to the common cold. Occasionally, you get especially severe strains of coronavirus like SARS and MERS, which are more deadly - especially for elderly, children, and those with weakened immune systems. MERS is very rare but kills 40% of those infected, while SARS has not been seen in humans since 2004 but kills roughly 10% of those infected.

The current coronavirus strain began in Wuhan China, and most likely originated from some sort of animal. It is reportedly less deadly than SARS or MERS; however, its appearance coincides with the Lunar New Year which complicates things. Over the Lunar New Year (AKA Chinese New Year) lots of people travel into and around the region visiting family and friends. This means that there's an increased risk of an outbreak or spread to other countries.

That being said, China and other countries in the region have gotten a lot better about creating and maintaining quarantine and medical screening protocols since SARS, and so are doing much more to try and limit the spread of the virus. Lots of air ports are using infrared screening and countries like Taiwan have prepped quarantine areas for patients who inevitably return from the Wuhan region with the virus.

AFAIK scientists do not know entirely how its transmitted, but right now it seems like its able to be passed from person-to-person. Also, based on other diseases its likely through droplets or airborne. Droplets consist of things like spit and the water vapor from your breath, and is hazardous because it tends to settle on surfaces. Airborne transmission transmits via the air, and is a problem because the virus can get through some low-grade filters like cloth face masks."

> Today, Chinese health authorities reported that more than 130 new pneumonia cases caused by the virus were identified over the weekend, bringing the total in China alone to 201, including three outside of Wuhan.

> Wuhan authorities have also reported that no health care workers tending to coronavirus patients have become ill, a common occurrence when a new virus with the ability to spread between people emerges.

> The China CDC website emphasizes that the disease is not SARS-whose emergence in late 2002 caused a global crisis that many Chinese remember well-and urges people to &quot;Not believe five big rumors about the Wuhan viral pneumonia.&quot; Those include claims that the Wuhan pneumonia is caused by a new SARS virus, that the SARS virus is still being found in bats, and that the Wuhan pneumonia may have been affecting people for a long time.

Remember currently China is experiencing influenza A. UNTIL last week most the country's hospitals were not screening for coronavirus ( most testing was for influenza A and treating the illness, which is appropriate as it is flu season ). Indeed up till now most people are still coming into hospital for influenza than coronavirus.  


However some people have died from what is presumed to be influenzae which might be coronavirus. Remember, just because one is infected with influenzae does not mean one does not have coronavirus. However, if you did not screen for it ( and to be frank a lot of hospitals just started knowing where to send a coronavirus testing to ) you would not know. You would think ( quite legitimately if the person displays just severe flu symptoms ) that the person died from the flu you found.   


There are some bereaved relatives angrily accusing doctors in China of not screening for coronavirus in the first week of January this year for deceased members of family who they said died from the flu. While it is possible they died from coronavirus instead of the flu .. how would the doctors even know it is a coronavirus? Hell at that time people thought it was just confined to the market!!!"

It's a big deal because authorities want this outbreak and contain this to avoid it spreading and infecting hundreds of thousands.

also, WE ARE IN THE MIDST OF A POSSIBLE PANDEMIC (or at least a scare). Something like 300 people in China are infected by a novel strand of coronavirus (including 16 medical staff) and six have died so far.

> “He is not infected with the Chinese coronavirus,” Mr Thanit told The Phuket News today (Jan 21).

> “He has contracted a serious form of pnemonia,” he added.

> Asked why doctors in Bangkok might now be questioning whether or not Mr Shorely might be infected with the new virus, Dr Thanit said, “I have no idea what has happened since Mr Shorely was taken to Bangkok.”

Mr Thanit is the Phuket Public Health Office Chief. He's not the doctor who treated Mr. Shorley, but a public official with a vested interest in Phuket not being seen as a dangerous area for the Wuhan flu. Thai officials have lied in the past for similar reasons.

More importantly, his info is allegedly based on a blood test done at the Phi Phi Island Hospital, which must have rather limited facilities, given how small the island is. If such a hospital could do a conclusive test to rule out the emerging Wuhan flu at this early stage of the outbreak, I'd be seriously impressed."

However that incubation period can be from 2 to 10 days, which is still quite a few infected getting through. Also the symptoms of coronavirus are similar to the flu, so you have the issue of needing medical practitioners on site to separate those that have the flu from those with coronavirus. 

I would still use IR scanners over nothing, but I'm just frustrated we haven't innovated and found a more effective method. I mean IR scanners were an innovative detection method back in 2003."

Still not great to see such rapid international growth of an as yet unknown virus, but some of the 6 fatalities were apparently very elderly and the coronavirus left them susceptible to pneumonia.

>A significant issue in the panel’s deliberations will be the severity of infections. Some of the deaths reported so far appear to have been in sick, elderly people, which suggests the virus poses the greatest danger to people whose health is already compromised, Heymann said.

>“It’s important to stress that this virus at the moment has been causing mild illness in the vast majority of people that have been affected,” he said in an interview on Bloomberg TV. “There’s around 10% of cases that have ended up in critical condition and there’s been deaths, but the vast majority of the 200-plus people infected have resulted in mild illness.”"

Recently, there is a big news appear in China that at present, pneumonia of unknown cause has appeared in Wuhan and surrounding cities in China. Humans have limited knowledge of the new coronavirus found in Wuhan, the source of infection is unknown, the transmission route is not clear, and whether it has been transmitted from person to person has not been fully determined. However, for infectious diseases, the classic approach is still likely to be effective: isolate the patient, avoid contact with the patient's secretions, and closely observe the contact to isolate them as soon as they become ill. And as of 23:00 on January 21, 319 cases of pneumonitis with new coronavirus infection have been diagnosed. I posted my own comments that we first need to trust our government and Medical Regulatory Authority that they are trying their best to find the ways to control this and solutions. And then we need to pay more attention on ourselves, accouring to the news that in China not all the regions all find  these cases, but we still need to find the ways to  protect against possible outbreaks. For example, most people know the need to wear disposable masks, however they may use the wrong way to waer the masks, they need to know the correct posture to wear it. 

Also I posted that hope  this mega epidemic can end soon. Because the most improtant traditional festival is coming soon, just like the Christmas, all the familly memebers come back and have a great holiday togethe to start the new year. This is a happy family reunion day. We don't want the woesome attmosphere show up in that great days."

By the way China did nothing to stop tourists from traveling to Taiwan during the SARS outbreak and they're not going to do it with this coronavirus either.

These diseases get created over there, they don't do nearly enough to stop the spread of those diseases, they cover up the extent of these outbreaks, they're only too happy to see it spread to Taiwan and then they try to isolate Taiwan from the international medical community and hamper efforts to fight it.

Just stop them from coming here until they can provide solid, credible proof that they have contained it."

BEIJING - A fourth person has died in an outbreak of a new coronavirus in China, authorities said Tuesday, as more places stepped up medical screening of travelers from the country as it enters its busiest travel period.

Concerned about a global outbreak similar to SARS, which spread from China to more than a dozen countries in 2002-2003, numerous nations have adopted screening measures for travelers arriving from China, especially those from the central city of Wuhan, where the outbreak is thought to have originated and which has accounted for the vast majority of the cases.

Australia receives a significant number of travelers from China, including three direct flights a week from Wuhan into Sydney, and these flights will be met by border security and biosecurity staff for assessments, Murphy told reporters.

Japan, South Korea, Hong Kong and other countries and regions with extensive travel links to China are also enacting stricter screening measures.

The head of the China's expert team on the illness, respiratory expert Zhong Nanshan, said two people in Guangdong province in southern China caught the virus from family members, state media said.

China has notified and maintained close communication with the World Health Organization and other relevant countries and regions, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said at a regular news briefing.

SARS first infected people in southern China in late 2002 and spread to more than two dozen countries, killing nearly 800."

It’s always good to overreact to these sort of things than under react and potentially miss stopping a potential epidemic. That being said, fear-mongering can cause people to turn off after a while and that leads to people ignoring warnings in the future.

**What you need to know in 400 words (I summarized this from this** [CNN article](https://www.cnn.com/2020/01/20/health/what-is-coronavirus-explained/index.html) ) 


What we know is it causes pneumonia and then doesn't respond to antibiotic treatment, which is not surprising, but then in terms of mortality, SARS kills 10% of the individuals,"" Poon, a virologist at the School of Public Health at The University of Hong Kong, said. China confirms new coronavirus can spread between humansThe World Health Organization offered guidance to countries on how they can prepare for it, including how to monitor for the sick and how to treat patients. Here are seven things you should know about a coronavirus.

Coronavirus symptoms

The viruses can make people sick, usually with a mild to moderate upper respiratory tract illness, similar to a common cold. Coronavirus symptoms include a runny nose, cough, sore throat, possibly a headache and maybe a fever, which can last for a couple of days. For those with a weakened immune system, the elderly and the very young, there's a chance the virus could cause a lower, and much more serious, respiratory tract illness like a pneumonia or bronchitis. Three to four out of every 10 patients infected with MERS died, according to the CDC.Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome, also known as SARS, is the other coronavirus that can cause more severe symptoms.

How it spreads

Viruses can spread from human contact with animals. When it comes to human-to-human transmission of the viruses, often it happens when someone comes into contact with the infected person's secretions. Depending on how virulent the virus is, a cough, sneeze or handshake could cause exposure. The virus can also be transmitted by touching something an infected person has touched and then touching your mouth, nose or eyes.

Coronavirus treatment

Most of the time, symptoms will go away on their own. Doctors can relieve symptoms by prescribing a pain or fever medication.

How can you can prevent it

There is no vaccine to protect against this family of viruses, at least not yet. Trials for a MERS vaccine are underway.

Coronavirus and pregnancy

SARS-associated illnesses were linked to cases of spontaneous abortion, maternal death and critical maternal illness, a 2004 study found.

Coronavirus and cats, dogs and other animals

One can cause feline infectious peritonitis in cats and something called a pantropic canine coronavirus can infect cats and dogs, according to a 2011 study. Cats can catch SARS, but none of the infected cats developed symptoms, according to the study. The feline coronavirus typically is asymptomatic, but can cause mild diarrhea."

However, we're not seeing evidence of that happening at the moment. The infected count in various Chinese cities still lies within expected range, listed [here (slide 5 and 6)](https://www.med.hku.hk/f/news/3543/7403/presentation_wuhan%20Coronavirus_20200121_final_1033.pdf).

Whether not seeing evidence for it means it's definitely not happening is another problem, and I can't answer or theorize about that. We'll need more data.

But do note with coronavirus (SARS, MERS), it's not the natural spreading of the virus that we're most concerned about (according to Hong Kong University), but rather Super-Seeding Events. Detecting and suppressing SSE is the focus. Until we see signs of SSE, isolated exported cases are not of great concern.

Again, there might be a SSE caused during the 6 days incubation period, but until then don't fret. Authorities should be in full force to make sure that's not the case."

As far as symptoms?  No.  The coronavirus causes symptoms similar to influenza (the flu), but the herpes virus generally just produces skin sores.  Some lie dormant, some strike immediately.

It's actually very fascinating stuff, and somewhat scary.

Should you be worried about this outbreak?  Don't lose any sleep over it.  Remember the SARS outbreak in the early 2000s?  That was the coronavirus.  Did you get that?  Did you get the bird flu? Swine flu? Zika?

Standard hygiene, wash your hands properly, avoid people coughing, practice safe sex, get applicable vaccines, and if you're suddenly really sick or feel like crap after a few days, go see a doctor.  And sleep well."

2020-01-21,williambotter,brasilnoticias,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/brasilnoticias/comments/es1526/identificado_el_primer_infectado_en_estados/ff74sst/," El nuevo [virus de Wuhan](//elpais.com/sociedad/2020/01/20/actualidad/1579546139_037964.html), que ha dejado ya [seis muertos en China](//elpais.com/sociedad/2020/01/21/actualidad/1579603091_184823.html) y cientos de afectados, ha cruzado el Pacífico. Un hombre de unos 30 años que viajó a esa región china fue diagnosticado con el virus la semana pasada en Seattle, en el Estado de Washington, según confirmó este martes el Centro de Control de Enfermedades de Estados Unidos (CDC), mientras todo el país estaba pegado a la televisión para seguir el *impeachment* contra Donald Trump en el Senado.

 El virus de Wuhan es un nuevo coronavirus llamado 2019-nCov que se transmite entre humanos y provoca enfermedades respiratorias. Fue detectado por primera vez hace menos de un mes. Desde esta ciudad, situada en la zona central del territorio chino y donde viven 11 millones de personas —más que Londres o Nueva York—, el patógeno comenzó a extenderse a las provincias vecinas. El pasado viernes, por ejemplo, no había ningún positivo fuera de allí, pero ahora ya son 38 los casos repartidos por otras 15 grandes urbes chinas y ha saltado a cuatro países del sureste asiático.

 El paciente de Seattle, del que se desconoce por el momento su identidad, está ingresado en el Centro Médico Regional de Everett, la capital del condado de Snohomish (Washington). Se encuentra estable y no se le considera un riesgo. El CDC también ha explicado que el enfermo no tenía síntomas cuando aterrizó el día 15 de enero en EE UU. Acudió al médico el pasado domingo y fue hospitalizado por una neumonía. El paciente no visitó ninguno de los mercados de Wuhan, donde se confirmaron numerosos casos de afectados por el virus, pero sí estuvo en la región, según ha explicado a la prensa Nancy Messonnier, directora del departamento de enfermedades respiratorias del CDC.

 Desde el pasado viernes 17, el CDC había impuesto controles especiales para vigilar la posible entrada del virus al país en los aeropuertos con más actividad de la costa oeste, San Francisco y Los Ángeles, y el de Nueva York. Son los tres aeropuertos con más pasajeros procedentes de la región de Wuhan. El CDC ha destinado alrededor de 100 trabajadores a estos aeropuertos y ha instalado salas de cuarentena. Las autoridades sanitarias estaban alerta desde hace dos semanas. El pasado 11 de enero habían publicado una advertencia sanitaria Nivel 1 para pasajeros que hubieran estado en Wuhan.

 Un grupo de expertos del Centro de Epidemiología de Enfermedades Infecciosas de la Universidad de Hong Kong sugiere que la realidad es aún más preocupante que los datos ofrecidos por China. Según un informe suyo elaborado en colaboración con la Organización Mundial de la Salud (OMS) y presentado este martes, el número total de infectados [puede rozar ya los 1.500: 1.343 en Wuhan y 115 en el resto del país. ](//elpais.com/sociedad/2020/01/20/actualidad/1579494586_763520.html?rel=listapoyo&rel=listapoyo)

 Además de en China y en EE UU, ha habido casos de personas con este virus detectados en Corea del Sur, Tailandia, Japón y Taiwán, donde una mujer de 55 años ha sido reconocida también este martes con la enfermedad. Como en los casos anteriores, viajó a Wuhan en las últimas semanas. El ministro de Sanidad de la isla, Chen Shih-chung, ha asegurado que ninguno de los familiares de la enferma presenta síntoma alguno, similares a los de una neumonía ordinaria, y que otras 46 personas que estuvieron en contacto con ella durante el trayecto de avión han sido puestas en observación. Además, Filipinas y Australia también han anunciado haber tomado medidas ante los primeros casos sospechosos en su territorio nacional. 

 La OMS realizó este lunes una visita a Wuhan con un grupo de expertos sanitarios chinos, liderados por el doctor Zhong Nanshan, director del Laboratorio Estatal de Enfermedades Infecciosas en Cantón y eminencia nacional en la materia. Según este conglomerado de expertos, 15 empleados médicos en la ciudad han contraído el virus, lo que confirma el contagio entre humanos —un extremo descartado hasta el fin de semana pasado—.  


 La escalada de este nuevo coronavirus, descubierto hace dos semanas, recuerda a la epidemia del [SARS](//elpais.com/tag/sars/a), con el que guarda similitudes genéticas. La epidemia de 2002, también originada en China, [causó la muerte de 700 personas en todo el mundo](//elpais.com/diario/2003/05/11/sociedad/1052604001_850215.html).

But essentially how terrifying a disease is depends on both how fast it spreads and how bad it is when you get it. This kind of coronavirus pneumonia is pretty terrifying because they spread easier than your typical bacterial pneumonia (or even most of the viral ones), has high fatality rate, and has severe complication.

 Flu kills people mostly via how much it can infect especially during season, but the fatality rate (i.e. your chance of dying once you got it) is really not that high, unless you are immunocompromised or an elderly, compared to SARs and SARs like virus.

SARS is like the middle ground between bacterial pneumonia and flu, where it spreads fast, though not as fast as flu, but it has a higher chance for complications as bad as bacterial pneumonia compared to flu, but without the kind of antibiotic treatment that bacterial pneumonia has or the vaccine that flu has. And this coronavirus is pretty similar to SARS.

So the chance it will spread very widely outside of China is pretty low, but it will certainly suck a lot for anyone in China or near China (i.e. especially Hong Kong), and anyone who is unfortunate enough to have been infected by it."

> There are fears that the virus could spread swiftly - and further across the country - as millions of people across China prepare to travel home for the Chinese New Year holidays later this week.

> Analysis of the genetic code of the new virus shows it is more closely related to Sars than any other human coronavirus.

Back during the 2003 SARS outbreak, [only 8273 people were infected worldwide with 775 deaths.](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Severe_acute_respiratory_syndrome#/History) Only 349 people died in the PRC. That's barely a drop in the bucket.

If they wanted SARS to deal with overpopulation back in 2003, then their plan sure failed. Also, the current coronavirus is allegedly *weaker* than SARS.

You want to go into conspiracy land and claim that millions got infected in China and actually thousands died? Even that can be easily proven false. Viruses don't work that way. The PRC would have to simultaneously lock down/restricted all outside travel (which we know never happened) while not caring about the massive outbreak in the mainland. 

If there was a massive outbreak in the PRC, we would have known. Why? Because there would have been at least half as large of an outbreak outside of China. And, as far as I know, no other country has been hiding their SARS data.

As much as I hate the CCP, spreading lies like this around doesn't help anyone."

The 2019–20 novel coronavirus outbreak, also known as the Wuhan coronavirus, the China pneumonia outbreak or the Wuhan pneumonia (simplified Chinese: 武汉肺炎; traditional Chinese: 武漢肺炎; pinyin: Wǔhàn fèiyán) began in mid-December 2019 in the city of Wuhan on the Yangtze River in central China, as an emerging cluster of people with pneumonia of unknown cause, linked primarily to stallholders who worked at the Huanan Seafood Market (華南海鮮市場), which also sold live animals. Chinese scientists subsequently isolated a new coronavirus, the 2019-nCoV, which has been found to be at least 70% similar in gene sequence to SARS-CoV. As of 21 January 2020, increased testing has shown near to 300 confirmed cases. Six deaths have occured and there is evidence of human-to-human spread. It has not however shown the same severity as SARS, raising questions including whether the virus has been circulating for longer than previously thought.2019-nCoV does not currently have an effective medicine treatment or vaccine, though efforts to develop ones are underway.

These illnesses usually only last for a short amount of time. Symptoms may include runny nose, headache, cough, sore throat, fever, a general feeling of being unwell**.

Okay, I'm a healthcare practitioner in Canada. Try getting viral pneumonia or any other LRTI with fever in a North American hospital and see how quickly they write you a prescription and push you out the door. *This is a man who was capable of leaving the hospital, heading to the airport, and boarding a plane.* If you are not collapsing in a hospital with an O2 Sat <85, you are not going to be sent out the door. Okay, here's [our algorithm](http://www.vhpharmsci.com/Resources/Pocket/Regional%20Community-Acquired%20Pneumonia%20Guidelines%20(7MAR16)%20FINAL.pdf) for when to send people home if you want to be specific.

You think hospitals in NA will swab, run lab exams, and send samples to pathology for everyone who walks in with a respiratory tract infection? Of course they don't. From what I'm gleaming, this man received a standard of care. Even if they did, let's say they bothered to assay and figured out it's a ""Coronavirus"". If you experienced a common cold in your life, that was most likely caused by a [coronavirus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus#Diseases_caused_by_coronaviruses). ""Coronavirus"" doesn't tell you jack shit. Yes, we can always figure out *in the middle* of an outbreak if there is one particularly virulent strain of a coronavirus, liks SaRS-CoV, but otherwise saying OMG YOU CAUGHT CORONAVIRUS is, >99% of the time, saying OMG YOU CAUGHT A COLD.

I'd be happy to show cases of other aerosol and droplet vector diseases that spread just as easily through NA, but then I would be accused of whataboutism probably. The point is it's pretty damn easy for a potentially epidemic contagion to spread and be missed by healthcare workers anywhere, and they are more easily transmitted in denser cities. Isolation is VERY VERY SELDOM a protocol for any infectious disease - maybe rabies and norovirus, hell, C. Diff doesn't even call for isolation."

However, the samples tested positive for the non-specific pancoronavirus assay, thus the specimen has been sent to Australia to identify the specific coronavirus strain” 

[source ](https://cebudailynews.inquirer.net/282971/new-coronavirus-strain-in-cebu-city) 

What’s interesting and scary about this is not only does it appear to be a new strain. It also has both indirect person- to-person transmission and direct person-to-person transmission (limited but acknowledged by public health England."

The fact is, we don't know if it's going to be bad, we should keep an eye on it, but there is something of an undue media blitz on this. An over-reaction from the media. No one (except North Korea) is closing borders or instituting major quarantines. People should go on as normal until told otherwise.  The flu kills 12,000 – 61,000 each year, on average.

> BEIJING: The number of deaths from a new SARS-like virus has climbed to nine as of the end of Tuesday (Jan 21) with 440 confirmed cases, Chinese health officials said as authorities stepped up efforts to control the outbreak by discouraging public gatherings in Hubei province.

> Another 2,197 cases of close contact with patients had been confirmed and there was evidence of ""respiratory transmission"" of the virus, National Health Commission Vice-Minister Li Bin told reporters.

> Advertisement

> Advertisement

> The number of cases compares with the total of more than 300 reported earlier as of Tuesday.

> 

> The coronavirus is transmitted via the respiratory tract and there ""is the possibility of viral mutation and further spread of the disease"", said Li.

> 

> He added that live animals were not allowed to enter Wuhan, the central Chinese city in Hubei where the outbreak originated.

> Advertisement

> Advertisement

> Hubei had been asked to minimise public gatherings and people across the country were urged to avoid densely populated areas in general, the health commission said. China would also step up cooperation with the World Health Organization (WHO), Li added.

> Officials found to have covered up infections would be a ""sinner for eternity before the Party and the people"", the Chinese Communist Party's Central Political and Legal Commission said in a post on its WeChat social media account that was subsequently deleted.

> 

> The health commission announced measures to contain the disease as hundreds of millions of people travel across the country for this week's Chinese New Year holiday, including disinfection and ventilation at airports, train stations and shopping centres.

> ""When needed, temperature checks will also be implemented in key areas at crowded places,"" the commission said in a statement.

> 

> A staff member screens arriving passengers with thermal scanners at Hankou railway station in Wuhan, in China's central Hubei province. (AFP Photo)

> ""I'm not sure that we could expect more of them at this stage in the outbreak, particularly when they are understandably focused on responding to the outbreak and trying to contain it ahead of the Chinese Lunar New Year celebrations,"" said Adam Kamradt-Scott, an infectious diseases expert at the Centre for International Security Studies at the University of Sydney.

> 

> The WHO said on Tuesday the new coronavirus was likely to spread to other parts of China and possibly other countries in the coming days.

> WHO spokesman Tarik Jasarevic said new cases would appear as China stepped up monitoring.

> ""If you increase surveillance and testing you are likely to get new numbers,"" he added.

> Airports around the world have tightened screening of travellers from China as officials confirmed the coronavirus strain is contagious between humans.

> Thailand, South Korea, Japan and Taiwan have all previously confirmed cases of the disease, while the United States confirmed its first case on Tuesday.

> 

> Fears of a pandemic similar to the SARS outbreak that started in China and killed nearly 800 people in 2002-2003 have roiled global markets, with aviation and luxury goods stocks hit particularly hard and the Chinese yuan tumbling.

> 

> Fifteen medical personnel are among those infected in China. Symptoms include fever, coughing and difficulty breathing. The viral infection can cause pneumonia and can be passed from person to person.

> Though the origin of the virus has yet to be identified, WHO said the primary source was probably animal. Chinese officials have linked the outbreak to Wuhan's seafood market.

Hospitals can give you a relatively quick answer to whether or not what you've got is the flu and can give you fluids. The latter isn't as useless as it sounds if you need it, but there is no quick cure. 

The best thing to do if you have a viral infection, or think you might, and you are not imunocompromised, is stay home and especially avoid crowded areas to minimize spread of the disease. And, as you say, try to cover your face if you sneeze or cough, ideally with a face mask (can't accidentally sneeze into your face mask then open a door with it, for example).

In China they have massive live or wet markets, where the animals are both brought to, and then slaughtered for the customer. So the slaughtering and the housing of the live animals are happening very close to each other while the markets are open. 

This causes intermingling of these live animals, unsanitary conditions in regards to the markets, unpackaged meats, and all that bacteria and interesting strains of whatever to have jumping off points to other organisms.

Unsure of any recent major outbreaks in a new strain of a communicable disease like this strain of coronavirus in Africa - I mostly see the results of unclean water, lack of access to medicine, misinformation, and proper containment causing most of Africa's woes when were talking about things like HIV/AIDS, diarrheal diseases, and malaria being some of the most deadly."

The incubation period for SARS is estimated to be 1 to 14 days with a median of 4 to 5 days. The incubation period for MERS is usually 5 or 6 days, but it can range from 2 to 14 days.

&nbsp;

>The median incubation period for secondary cases associated with limited human-to-human transmission is approximately 5 days (range 2-14 days). In MERS-CoV patients, the median time from illness onset to hospitalization is approximately 4 days. In critically ill patients, the median time from onset to intensive care unit (ICU) admission is approximately 5 days, and median time from onset to death is approximately 12 days.


As an educated guess at the usual median of other types of Coronavirus closely related to 2019-nCoV, incubation period should be 3-7 days. Numbers must be lagging behind by a big amount.

The incubation period for SARS is estimated to be 1 to 14 days with a median of 4 to 5 days. The incubation period for MERS is usually 5 or 6 days, but it can range from 2 to 14 days.

&nbsp;

>The median incubation period for secondary cases associated with limited human-to-human transmission is approximately 5 days (range 2-14 days). In MERS-CoV patients, the median time from illness onset to hospitalization is approximately 4 days. In critically ill patients, the median time from onset to intensive care unit (ICU) admission is approximately 5 days, and median time from onset to death is approximately 12 days.


As an educated guess at the usual median of other types of Coronavirus closely related to 2019-nCoV, incubation period should be 3-7 days. Numbers must be lagging behind by a big amount.

Reason being that there will be a lot of travelers coming from China and going from the US to China and back this week and the next due to Chinese Lunar New Year.  This could result in more cases stacking up in a very short amount of time which will cause a run on N95 respirators.  I've already seen runs on them this morning with price increases on several popular brands on Amazon and some of them going out of stock.  If you wait too long, like during the Ebola outbreak which only had 4 cases diagnosed in the US (excluding patients brought to the US), it became very hard to find an N95 as Amazon and others were sold out, even though Ebola is not generally associated with being airborne like coronavirus is.  

Worst case scenario...you've got a bunch of N95 masks that you can use for various tasks around the house that might involve fine particulates."

It might piss people off, but it would be legitimate and it might save a lot of lives.

Then again, I don't think he's entirely capable of making moves that benefit more than himself."
