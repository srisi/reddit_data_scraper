''

1. The virulence (R0) of SARS-CoV-2 is estimated between 1.4-6.49, with a mean estimate of 3.28\[[1](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/coronavirus-may-spread-faster-than-who-estimate#Higher-estimates-than-WHO-predict)\] . This mean estimate is much higher than the seasonal flu, which has an R0 of 1.3\[[2](https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2020/01/how-fast-and-far-will-new-coronavirus-spread/605632/)\] . What this means is that SARS-CoV-2 spreads signficantly faster than the seasonal flu.
2. The Case Fatality Rate (CFR) of SARS-CoV-2 is at least 2-3%\[[3](https://academic.oup.com/ajcp/advance-article/doi/10.1093/ajcp/aqaa029/5735509)\] . This is 20-30 times higher than the CFR of the season flu, which is around .1%\[[4](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/02/03/the-flu-has-already-killed-10000-across-us-as-world-frets-over-coronavirus.html)\] .
3. SARS-CoV-2 can be transmitted without the infected showing any symptoms\[[5](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2762028)\] . This makes it much more difficult to control.
4. Roughly 20% of SARS-CoV-2 infections result in serious symptoms that require medical intervention\[[6](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/coronavirus-81-of-cases-are-mild-study-says#80.9%-of-the-cases-are-mild)\] . This is more than 10 times the hospitalization rate of the seasonal flu\[[7](https://www.cdc.gov/flu/about/burden/index.html)\].
5. Symptoms from SARS-CoV-2 can persist over a month\[[8](https://www.thelancet.com/pb-assets/Lancet/pdfs/S2213260020300795.pdf)\] compared to the seasonal flu where symptoms typically tend to clear after 5 days\[[9](https://www.emedicinehealth.com/flu_in_adults/article_em.htm)\] .
6. There is no vaccine for SARS-CoV-2\[[10](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/about/prevention-treatment.html)\] whereas people regularly get annual flu shots.
7. There is no [herd immunity](https://www.ovg.ox.ac.uk/news/herd-immunity-how-does-it-work) for SARS-CoV-2 which means that it can theoretically infect the entire population. *See*, for example, a [Korean psychiatric department where the virus infected 99/102 people](https://twitter.com/covid_19news/status/1231581727438467072?s=21).''

Other companies may be relying more on the cloud with employees working remotely, so some of these companies selling cloud-based products may be well positioned to benefit. That point, coupled with the fact that MSFT has little China exposure, could we potentially see MSFT take off again in the next 2-3 weeks?

Don't mind *WHY* things are changing. If a stock is going up or down, in the short prize, It could be MANY causes. Even for a fund manager angry or suspicious of virus. So, the First thing is: If you are going to hold It, you have to search for FUNDAMENTALS, constancy and profit stability. So, the ONLY thing that matters for the price is the profit. THE ONLY. Stocks aren't going down because of coronavirus, but for a high sell pressure. And that IS It. 

Most of professional agents/commentarists on finances are Just earning their own money and saying what they are being paid for: provide a ""SECURITY"" for Lost investor. Your only material HAS TO BE the quarter results (If you have time) or annual statements. I use too one sheet with past profits, recipes and other statistics.

If you buy constantly good enterprises periodically, you are safe.

People could say ""but the P/E..."", ""But the Coronavirus..."" There are really important things with those indicators, and facts, but for you, person who needs to invest AND Will make New enterings periodically, they don't mind.

You can stay at home, but there's a cost to it: maybe you won't be able to work from home that long, maybe you'll need to go shopping at some point, maybe you're prone to anxiety or panic. If the virus reaches your area and you have the means, you should certainly consider it. Simply living close to a planned quarantine facility is no reason to panic or stay at home."

1-It‚Äôs a live virus, it needs a ‚Äúhost‚Äù in order to ‚Äúlive‚Äù. It will die upon being on non-live surfaces. It is also spread through contact with contaminated wet bodily fluids.

2-even if it could live without a ‚Äúhost‚Äù per say, it would need optimal conditions to do so. Shipping from China takes awhile. And shipping conditions (temperatures, humidity, environments) are NOT controlled or consistent meaning the odds of such a virus surviving that trip are extremely slim.

3-The coronavirus is not a new thing. Think of it as their version of our flu. Each year the strains evolve and change and become a new strain from previously. 

4-You hear the numbers of those getting ill or dying and they seem extreme. However you have the think of the amount of people that are located in that region. The math works out to about 4 out of every 100,000 people becoming infected, and even smaller statistics of those who die from it."

WASHINGTON (REUTERS) - The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said on Monday (Feb 24) there were 14 confirmed cases of the¬†coronavirus¬†in the country, apart from the 39 cases among those evacuated from the Diamond Princess cruise ship and the city of Wuhan in China.

This brings the total number of confirmed cases to 53.

The agency said the 14 confirmed cases included two new cases reported from Humboldt County and Sacramento County in California.

On Friday, the CDC reported 13 cases among those within the country and 21 cases from among the repatriated Americans and said they were preparing for the possibility of the spread of the virus through US communities that would force closures of schools and businesses.

US public health officials have also warned that cases among the repatriated citizens will likely increase.

Meanwhile, the Trump administration is considering asking lawmakers for emergency funding to ramp up its response to the fast-spreading coronavirus, a White House spokesman said on Monday without providing details.

""We need some funding here to make sure that we ... protect all Americans, that we keep us safe,"" White House spokesman Hogan Gidley said on Fox News Channel.

Asked how much funding the administration may ask Congress to approve, Gidley told reporters at the White House the administration was not yet ready to make an announcement.

Politico and The Washington Post, citing people familiar with the planning, reported the administration may request US$1 billion from Congress.

An administration official told Reuters the amount was being finalised, and the request could go to lawmakers this week.

The virus has spread to some 29 countries and territories beyond mainland China, with outbreaks in South Korea, Iran and Italy rattling global markets.

The United States has not had the kind of virus spread through communities as in China and elsewhere, but health officials are preparing for the possibility even as Americans affected so far have been quarantined.

Representatives for the US Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) declined to comment on the funding requests.

Democrats, who control the House of Representatives, have urged the Trump administration to seek emergency funds after it notified Congress in recent weeks that it had already spent millions of dollars on its virus response, according to the Washington Post.

Trump has been at odds with his own White House advisers over China's coronavirus response. He has sought to downplay the impact of the virus, saying it could fade in April with warmer weather - something health experts said is unknown.

""We have aggressively worked to combat the spread of this virus, tried to prevent it as best we could from coming into this country,"" Gidley told reporters.

The administration is also grappling with where to send Americans evacuated from the Diamond Princess who tested positive for the virus after backing off plans to quarantine them in a federal facility in Alabama.

In a statement on Monday, HHS cited a ""rapidly evolving situation,"" but said the Alabama center was ""not needed at this time"" and that it was looking for alternatives."

The second case was registered after a Bahraini woman arriving at the Bahrain International Airport from Iran via Dubai was examined as part of the precautionary measures taken in light of the global Coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak.

The ministry indicated that the infected citizen had arrived in Bahrain after a visit to Iran, accompanied by her husband and her sister in law, stressing that the accompanying relatives were also moved to isolation as a precautionary measure, after testing negative for the virus.

The ministry stressed that all necessary measures are being taken to examine each passenger arriving from affected countries and that they will be transferred immediately for treatment if symptoms of the condition are found or confirmed following laboratory analysis and will be isolated at the Ebrahim Khalil Kanoo Health Center in Salmaniya.

The ministry highlighted that a comprehensive medical protocol has been established to combat COVID-19, which is in line with established international guidelines as set out by the Gulf Health Council (GHC) and the World Health Organization (WHO).

The ministry added that patients who are suffering from or are suspected of suffering from COVID-19 are being isolated until laboratory tests are complete. If test results are negative, patients are advised to return home, and remain there for a further 14 days.

The mnistry noted that registered cases will remain under comprehensive observation and receive medical treatment from a specialised medical team.

The Ministry of Health noted that it continues to coordinate with all relevant authorities within the Kingdom of Bahrain and is taking all necessary measures to ensure the safety of citizens and residents.

The ministry calls upon all citizens and residents who are experiencing symptoms of COVID19, including a fever, coughing and difficulty breathing, or those who have travelled to any of the countries infected with the disease or have interacted with a person traveling from any of those locations, or interacted with an infected patient, to isolate themselves, call¬†‚Ä™444, and follow the instructions given by the medical team, and avoid close contact with others."

They block sunlight from hitting the surface of the planet, which is mostly ocean.  

Recently, several key things have occurred that has equaled a severe clearing of these aerosols. 

At the same time Greenhouse Gases are at their highest we‚Äôve ever experienced. 

The science is called Global Dimming [here is the wiki page](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_dimming).

[Here is a BBC documentary. ](https://www.dailymotion.com/video/xudm8n) 

What we have done, with the Coronavirus as a Black Swan event, is remove too much pollution, too quickly.  This is causing severe weather, swings in temperatures, dry conditions.  

Populated regions, where the most pollution is generated, will see the biggest change.  Some by as much as 15¬∞f.  Cities are heat-sinks. 

The clearing skies will raise Surface Solar Radiation (SSR) significantly. Drying out everything as the temperature rises to the full effects of having so much Greenhouse Gases in the atmosphere.  

This is all happening right now.

The reason: the man had returned to Cologne from Lombardy, but the city was not aware that the region had been designated as a Covid 19 risk area by the Robert Koch Institute (RKI). Now a quick test should bring clarity.  The patient is currently complaining about fever, the city said on Monday. The RKI has not announced on its website that Lombardy has been a ""risk area"" since Sunday - the city of Cologne stated that this information could only be found on a ""downstream website"".

It is likely that this was also spread via an intermediate carrier that was brought to the market after having been infected elsewhere.  

I posted weeks ago about a study published by Chinese scientists studying a similar SARS-like Bat virus that they infected lab rats with to see if it could be spread by species other than Bats.  The virus did survive and spread among the lab rats, who exhibited pneumonia-like symptoms and had large viral loads in their brain tissue when examined posthumously.  This doesn't support the idea that the lab rats escaped or were poorly disposed of if they were studying coronavirus at the lab in Wuhan, rather it supports the idea the virus was brought to market by an animal other than a bat which was infected elsewhere, likely through contact with infected Bat feces.  The faster spread in Wuhan could also be partially explained by rats being the intermediate carrier, as they have big time rat problems in China.  We likely won't know for sure because they disinfected the market before they could pinpoint the origin species :("

And I think you're not really viewing it logically. It is a big deal, but at this time there are only 35 cases in the US. Is that really supposed to push big stories that people want to know about from the front page?

You are viewing it from a POV that this will be the biggest pandemic in generations killing millions or something like that. But that is still just speculation at this point. The rate of growth worldwide is slowing, there are indicators that it could spread and take off again rapidly, but today that just isn't what is happening. 

If you were the news director of an outlet and you ignored all the other stories of the day to give all your attention to the virus, and it turns out to be less impactful than those worst-case scenarios, then you are probably out looking for a job in a few weeks. 

Things like the stock market having a big reaction will probably convince them to give it more coverage, but it isn't a perfect science when deciding how much time to allocate to each story and only as they develop will news organizations shift their priorities. 

I guess I just don't see any kind of big coverup here, just business as usual. Companies in the news business go with what sells, and if people become very interested in Coronavirus instead of Election news that will be what we see."

The institute expects by the end of April to start a clinical trial of about 20 to 25 healthy volunteers, testing whether two doses of the shot are safe and induce an immune response likely to protect against infection, NIAID Director Anthony Fauci said in an interview.

I've seen prices spike, but never a ""Who turned out the lights"" like this. Freight costs went up 500%, which is why my merch sat in some port warehouse for weeks. I don't pay the international side of freight, so it wasn't my cost, but it's delayed my getting paid significantly.

Fascinating!! Thanks for sharing. Now I am really terrified as to what's coming. 

>I don't think there's a lot of exports going into China as opposed to coming out (I personally don't know of anyone else who exports US made goods into China), but my freight forwarder in domestic port said even if travel/freight resumes as normal next month there's a huge backlog that needs to get shipped on top of new/regular shipments.

Hmm good point, I can only think of maybe automobiles(even though every car company in china except Tesla needs a domestic partner) and maybe food? I mean yea there are a lot of non essential things like airplanes, luxury goods as well. Maybe put cars under there as well? I guess food is the most important thing that gets sent over there? 

>I'm not a 'consumable' good, so our end user is ""discretionary spending,"" and as such, we're the canary in the economic coal mine. And our accounts (retailers) are usually pretty good at forecasting, so I'll see trends six months before the rest of the market.

My neighbors work for UCSF where 2 of the patients are and although they don't have a lot of information, if it somehow spread, they would know and they would tell us. I'm sure this is the case with all other hospitals as well in the US as well. It's hard to contain information in a free country like the US.

And as far as I last heard, the US will check for coronavirus if anyone comes in with flu-like symptoms. If we haven't gotten any reports of large clusters of infections, I think that at least we currently have it contained. But it also could be that there are clusters but people are not being affected.

But once we do start getting those reports, I expect the numbers to start increasing quickly like Italy, where entire neighborhoods or work places will get swabbed because of contact with a particular patient."

People can usually take care of themselves at home with OT medicines.  The doctor isn't going to do anything more than recommend advil, rest and fluids for the flu.  Meanwhile, the flu gets spread because people go to the doctor's office or the ER when they could be resting at home.  Breathing issues - dehydration that you can't take care of yourself?  You're absolutely right - go to the doctor.  I would guess that the coronavirus is going to be the same way - that unless people have breathing issues or issues that seem life threatening - that they will be advised to stay home and quarantine themselves.  I think going to the hospital to get tested when you aren't really ill - is going to be a serious strain on our resources and will cause additional spread.  People need to be smart about this.

It is not as bad as SARS, but the epidemic is worse because of the incubation. China for economic reasons and world face reasons obscures the problem and thus compounds the problem. They also have appalling living conditions for city people, and should not spend so much of their money on belt and road programs of conquest outside of China, and in stead should spend their money dealing with basic hygiene and sanitation in their cities.

The US was slow to shut down travel to China, and then let people out of quarantine too quickly.

The United States has only seen one negative growth quarter in terms of GDP since 2012.

The 20th patient is a 42-year-old South Korean woman and a relative of the 15th patient. She was identified to have been infected on Feb. 5.

Today I went to my GP again (third time in 3 weeks) because of respiratory- and flu like symptoms. Today they even send me in for bloodwork to make sure I dont have bacterial pneumonia or lung embolism.

The woman at the desk of rge doctors office didnt ask about my previous travels, nor did my GP. 
Same when i went rk the clinic to get mu blood drawn, no questions asked, even though we talked about the possibility of me having pneumonia. 

Its just baffling to me. I just heard I probably dont have lung embolism or a bacterial pneumonia, which is awesome, but my GP now suspects ""some"" viral infection. No word about gettibg tested for Coronavirus. 


So, ive now seen at least 5 Healthcare workers in the kast few weeks for my persistent lung issues. Never asked any of them about my travels or being in contact with foreigners. 

What if i was a moron and did travel to china a few weeks ago and juat didnt think of mentioning it? What if i worked at the Netherlands huge international Airport? Or if i worked for a Chinese import company? 

Dont get me wrong, I dont think I have the Coronavirus, but its shocking to me None of the health care workers has apparently thought of the possibility of me having it. I probably have the ""normal"" flu, but what if i did have the coronavirus? 
There must me many people wirh the same respiratory or flu-like sympons like me who don't get any questions asked. And it only takes one of them to be positive for Corona to get an Italy like situation.

No babies or children have died, so it seems like small children can shake this off pretty well. 

For about 15% of people who get it, the virus will bury itself deep in the lungs, causing a viral pneumonia requiring hospitalization. That would include being put on a ventilator (breathing tube) and a cocktail of strong medications which is still being experimented with, to prevent other symptoms from killing you. 

If you can get one, get an SpO2 finger monitor that can check your blood oxygen levels. So if you do have flu-like symptoms, and your SpO2 drops below about 93%, you will know you need to get yourself to a local or regional hospital which is able to support a severe Coronavirus patient.

WASHINGTON (REUTERS) - The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said on Monday (Feb 24) there were 14 confirmed cases of the¬†coronavirus¬†in the country, apart from the 39 cases among those evacuated from the Diamond Princess cruise ship and the city of Wuhan in China.

This brings the total number of confirmed cases to 53.

The agency said the 14 confirmed cases included two new cases reported from Humboldt County and Sacramento County in California.

On Friday, the CDC reported 13 cases among those within the country and 21 cases from among the repatriated Americans and said they were preparing for the possibility of the spread of the virus through US communities that would force closures of schools and businesses.

US public health officials have also warned that cases among the repatriated citizens will likely increase.

Meanwhile, the Trump administration is considering asking lawmakers for emergency funding to ramp up its response to the fast-spreading coronavirus, a White House spokesman said on Monday without providing details.

""We need some funding here to make sure that we ... protect all Americans, that we keep us safe,"" White House spokesman Hogan Gidley said on Fox News Channel.

Asked how much funding the administration may ask Congress to approve, Gidley told reporters at the White House the administration was not yet ready to make an announcement.

Politico and The Washington Post, citing people familiar with the planning, reported the administration may request US$1 billion from Congress.

An administration official told Reuters the amount was being finalised, and the request could go to lawmakers this week.

The virus has spread to some 29 countries and territories beyond mainland China, with outbreaks in South Korea, Iran and Italy rattling global markets.

The United States has not had the kind of virus spread through communities as in China and elsewhere, but health officials are preparing for the possibility even as Americans affected so far have been quarantined.

Representatives for the US Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) declined to comment on the funding requests.

Democrats, who control the House of Representatives, have urged the Trump administration to seek emergency funds after it notified Congress in recent weeks that it had already spent millions of dollars on its virus response, according to the Washington Post.

Trump has been at odds with his own White House advisers over China's coronavirus response. He has sought to downplay the impact of the virus, saying it could fade in April with warmer weather - something health experts said is unknown.

""We have aggressively worked to combat the spread of this virus, tried to prevent it as best we could from coming into this country,"" Gidley told reporters.

The administration is also grappling with where to send Americans evacuated from the Diamond Princess who tested positive for the virus after backing off plans to quarantine them in a federal facility in Alabama.

In a statement on Monday, HHS cited a ""rapidly evolving situation,"" but said the Alabama center was ""not needed at this time"" and that it was looking for alternatives."

If the virus continues to mutate, it can potentially
Get more virulent and hence, the rush to stop
It. 

(The dying healthcare staff in China, who are younger, are on heavy amphetamines. It is a not-so-secret they are used to increase staffs stamina. Amphetamines wreck havoc on the cardiovascular system. It‚Äôs my personal theory that is what has triggered some of those deaths)"

The virulence (R0) of SARS-CoV-2 is estimated between 1.4-6.49, with a mean estimate of 3.28\[[1](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/coronavirus-may-spread-faster-than-who-estimate#Higher-estimates-than-WHO-predict)\] . This mean estimate is much higher than the seasonal flu, which has an R0 of 1.3\[[2](https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2020/01/how-fast-and-far-will-new-coronavirus-spread/605632/)\] . What this means is that SARS-CoV-2 spreads signficantly faster than the seasonal flu.
2. The Case Fatality Rate (CFR) of SARS-CoV-2 is at least 2-3%\[[3](https://academic.oup.com/ajcp/advance-article/doi/10.1093/ajcp/aqaa029/5735509)\] .

3. SARS-CoV-2 can be transmitted without the infected showing any symptoms\[[5](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2762028)\] . This makes it much more difficult to control.
4. Roughly 20% of SARS-CoV-2 infections result in serious symptoms that require medical intervention\[[6](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/coronavirus-81-of-cases-are-mild-study-says#80.9%-of-the-cases-are-mild)\] . This is more than 10 times the hospitalization rate of the seasonal flu\[[7](https://www.cdc.gov/flu/about/burden/index.html)\].
5. Symptoms from SARS-CoV-2 can persist over a month\[[8](https://www.thelancet.com/pb-assets/Lancet/pdfs/S2213260020300795.pdf)\] compared to the seasonal flu where symptoms typically tend to clear after 5 days\[[9](https://www.emedicinehealth.com/flu_in_adults/article_em.htm)\] .
6. There is no vaccine for SARS-CoV-2\[[10](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/about/prevention-treatment.html)\] whereas people regularly get annual flu shots.
7. There is no [herd immunity](https://www.ovg.ox.ac.uk/news/herd-immunity-how-does-it-work) for SARS-CoV-2 which means that it can theoretically infect the entire population. *See*, for example, a [Korean psychiatric department where the virus infected 99/102 people](https://twitter.com/covid_19news/status/1231581727438467072?s=21)."

Se trata de un hombre de 84 a√±os que estaba ingresado en un hospital de B√©rgamo por otras enfermedades, otro hombre de 88 a√±os residente en Caselle Lanne, y de una paciente oncol√≥gica en la localidad de Brescia, cuya muerte ha anunciado la televisi√≥n p√∫blica Rai. Cuatro de los siete fallecimientos se han producido en la regi√≥n de Lombard√≠a, al norte del pa√≠s. Italia extrema las medidas de seguridad para frenar [la expansi√≥n del coronavirus](//elpais.com/sociedad/2020/02/22/actualidad/1582387037_081927.html), mientras los positivos en cinco regiones (Lombard√≠a, V√©neto, Emilia Roma√±a, Piamonte y Lacio) ascienden a 229, seg√∫n ha informado este lunes el jefe de la Protecci√≥n Civil, Angelo Borrelli en una comparecencia ante los medios.

 El coronavirus ha llegado a cinco regiones. Lombard√≠a suma 167 contagios (163 infectados y cuatro v√≠ctimas mortales); Veneto, 32 (26 positivos y un muerto); Emilia Roma√±a, 18; Piamonte cuatro (tras excluir dos casos m√°s tras realizar varias pruebas) y Lacio, tres (una pareja china actualmente ingresada en un hospital y un paciente curado).

 El virus ha golpeado a tres grandes ciudades ‚ÄîTur√≠n, Mil√°n y Venecia‚Äî que han tenido que suspender su vida normal cancelando la actividad escolar, cerrando bares, teatros, discotecas y anulando ferias o el carnaval m√°s famoso del mundo. Hasta el momento se han hecho m√°s de 3.000 an√°lisis y 50.000 personas han sido confinadas en 11 municipios que se consideran los principales focos del contagio. Nadie tiene ni idea de cu√°nto tiempo durar√° esta suerte de estado de excepci√≥n.

 La muerte de los tres pacientes este lunes se suman a las de una mujer en Cremona, que se encontraba desde ya hace tiempo hospitalizada en el departamento de Oncolog√≠a, y a las de un hombre de 78 a√±os de Vo' Euganeo, en la provincia de Padua (V√©neto), y una mujer de 77 a√±os que estuvo en Codogno, pero que falleci√≥ el 20 de febrero en su casa por complicaciones respiratorias.

 Mientras, las autoridades de Isla Mauricio mantienen en cuarentena a los pasajeros de un vuelo de Alitalia procedente de Roma por miedo al contagio. En la nave, viajaban 224 personas entre los pasajeros y la tripulaci√≥n. Unos 40 optaron por regresar a Italia. Por el contrario, [todos los vuelos programados desde Espa√±a con origen o destino Italia](//elpais.com/economia/2020/02/24/actualidad/1582536765_097209.html) se mantienen con normalidad. Tampoco se han adoptado medidas especiales para los pasajeros que viajan a esos destinos, aunque la aplicaci√≥n de medidas de control dependen de Sanidad Exterior.

 Tambi√©n ha vuelto a rodar con normalidad este lunes el tr√°fico ferroviario entre Austria e Italia, despu√©s de que en la noche del domingo quedase suspendido provisionalmente cuando un tren proveniente de Venecia fue detenido en Brennero al conocerse que viajaban dos pasajeros sospechosos de estar infectados por el coronavirus. Se ha descartado que ambos padezcan la enfermedad.

 El centro de Mil√°n era este domingo una ciudad fantasma. El Duomo ha permanecido cerrado. El Teatro alla Scala ha anunciado que cancelaba sus funciones, empezando por el esperado recital del pianista Maurizio Pollini previsto para la noche del lunes y con las entradas agotadas desde hac√≠a semanas. Los bares, pubs y discotecas echaron el cierre a las seis de la tarde. [El alcalde de la ciudad (1,3 millones de habitantes), Giuseppe Sala](//elpais.com/tag/milan/a), ha anunciado que la capital econ√≥mica de Italia, el s√≠mbolo de la prosperidad del pa√≠s, cerrar√° todas las escuelas, cines, museos y teatros la pr√≥xima semana. Sala fue el primero. Luego se sumaron a la iniciativa el resto de regiones afectadas y las otras dos capitales.

 Venecia se vio tambi√©n obligada a suspender los dos √∫ltimos d√≠as del Carnaval, que se cerraba el martes, despu√©s de que se registrar√°n dos positivos en la ciudad. En Lombard√≠a, V√©neto y Piamonte cerrar√°n todos los centros educativos, de infantil a la universidad. Y en las dos primeras se han prohibido todas las manifestaciones deportivas y culturales, cines y teatros.

 M√°s all√° del inicio de la dispersi√≥n, el Gobierno sigue sin encontrar el origen del contagio y al supuesto paciente cero, pero considera que hay dos focos claros: la provincia de Lodi y sus 10 municipios, y la localidad de Vo‚Äô Euganeo, en V√©neto. Ambas zonas est√°n afectadas por el decreto ley que obliga sus ciudadanos a permanecer confinados sin poder entrar o salir de dichos territorios y a someterse a unas estrictas medidas de control y abastecimiento.

 El Ejecutivo considera que, por ahora, es la √∫nica manera de frenar la epidemia, teniendo en cuenta que no cerrar√° el espacio a√©reo ni suspender√° el tratado de Schengen. Eso, y los m√°s de 3.000 test realizados. Hasta ahora se han hecho a individuos con contacto m√°s o menos directo con infectados o personas que hubieran estado en China. Pero Lombard√≠a y V√©neto han empezado ya a practicarlos a pacientes con s√≠ntomas parecidos a los del coronavirus."

1. The cancellation couldn't be announced HOURS before the event. Coronavirus has been in S Korea for a few weeks but no one knew/knows how serious it will prove to be. So the event was still set to proceed. That is until the government announced a RED ALERT an hour before the event which caused the event to be cancelled by the store. For them to find out about the red alert and come to a decision would have taken more than a half hour. So they probably only knew themselves that the event wasn't going to happen a few handful of minutes before, at which point all the fans would have already been at the venue and there was no longer a point to announce it online.

2. Like I said, most fans arrive at the venue at least an hour but most even before the event is supposed to start. They were there already when red alert was announced and BEFORE the event was decided to be cancelled. The coronavirus spreads just like a regular flu. So no the longer you are in close quarters with or exposed to someone with the virus, the higher the risk of infection. These events can take hours so that would have been very irresponsible when the country is now in red alert which means extreme caution should be practiced.

3. We weren't back stage. We don't know if the girls were FORCED to do anything. They were also already at the venue when the red alert was announced and the decision to cancel was made. It is possible they wanted to at least tell fans themselves and give them a chance to actually see the idols that they were looking forward to seeing, if only briefly, rather than let staff handle it (again we don't know who decided on the girls announcing it)

4. Like I said before, the longer everyone is together, the larger the threat. At fansigns there is very close contact between artists and fans. This would actually be where the threat of infection is largest for the artists. Fans were already at the venue when the red alert was announced so all they could do was minimize further risk by cancelling it.

The coronavirus was focused on 2 very specific areas in S Korea and the spread is happening very quickly so everyone is being caught of guard and trying to do what's best. Clearly they didn't want to cancel this event but now found that they couldn't in good conscious allow it to take place with a red alert being called. There's no black or white here. No right or wrong decision. That's what's frustrating. You want someone to blame, someone to be fired. But really it's just a series of unfortunate events that can't be blamed on a single person."

&#x200B;

 ‚ÄúWhat you get is the initial damage and rush of inflammatory cells, but the damage is so extensive that the body‚Äôs immune response is completely overwhelmed ‚Äî which causes even more immune response, more immune cells and more damage,‚Äù said Matthew Frieman, a virologist at the University of Maryland School of Medicine. 

The coronavirus is spread when an infected person sneezes or coughs, spraying droplets through the air. The sick person might sneeze directly in another person‚Äôs face or expel droplets widely, contaminating surfaces that healthy people touch before unknowingly spreading germs to their mouths or noses. Health-care workers are at especially high risk because they are exposed to very high doses of the virus and also perform procedures ‚Äî such as putting patients on ventilators to help them breathe ‚Äî that can spread it.

With infection, the virus probably begins to multiply inside cells lining the airway, which are fringed with hairlike structures. Coronaviruses that cause common colds are excellent at infecting the upper airway, while SARS tended to go deeper in the lungs. As the coronavirus gains strength, Frieman said, dead cells are sloughed off and collect in the airway, making breathing difficult.

‚ÄúIf the virus replicates very quickly, before your body has a chance to try and prevent it with an immune response, or if the immune response comes in too late, then it can‚Äôt control the virus and starts going berserk,‚Äù said Anthony Fehr, a virologist at the University of Kansas.

This is what scientists refer to as a ‚Äúcytokine storm,‚Äù which causes the immune system to start sending cells ready to do battle into the lung. At that point, it‚Äôs not just the virus doing damage to the body; the immune system begins wreaking havoc on the infected person ‚Äî also known as the ‚Äúhost‚Äù in medical parlance.

‚ÄúThe experience with other respiratory viruses would suggest it is a combination of the virus doing damage to the airways, secondary infections and the interplay with the host immune response,‚Äù said Erica S. Shenoy, an infectious diseases specialist at Massachusetts General Hospital.

The general risk factors for this mismatch between the immune system and any respiratory illness include advanced age and underlying chronic illnesses, including diabetes and high blood pressure, though public health experts are eager to understand more about who is most vulnerable in the current outbreak.

‚ÄúEvery individual is different,‚Äù Fehr said, and there are differences in how young and old or male and female immune systems react. ‚ÄúThere are lots of dynamics at play when you talk about each individual and how they might die from this virus or why they might survive.‚Äù

Problems can also stack up. Vineet Menachery, a virologist at the University of Texas Medical Branch, suspects that the coronavirus may work much like SARS. When the virus gets deep into the lungs, it can damage alveoli, the air sacs that take in oxygen. As cellular damage accumulates, lung tissue begins to stiffen. The heart must work harder to get limited oxygen to the rest of the organs.

‚ÄúWhat makes this new virus so damaging is you‚Äôre losing lung function, and that puts a strain on every organ in your body,‚Äù Menachery said.

In the patients who recover, the immune system‚Äôs response has worked: It has cleared the virus, with inflammation receding. Yet experts don‚Äôt know the long-term outcome for these individuals. It‚Äôs possible they will gain immunity and be protected from reinfection. Or they might get a less severe case in the future ‚Äî or not be protected at all. They also might just gain temporary immunity. It‚Äôs yet another unanswered question about the coronavirus."

The way this virus has been spreading during the last several weeks is quite alarming.  We are essentially at pandemic level now, though conveniently the WHO announced this weekend that they have removed this category level from their classification system.  

Aside from the rapid spread, the greatest concern is duration and seriousness of the illness.  It is estimated at a 2-3% fatality rate, which is 20-30 times higher than that for seasonal flu (0.1%).  Many with the illness end up with pneumonia which can quickly become a medical emergency; an estimated 10-20% of those infected will develop critical or serious symptoms.  The duration of coronavirus is also much longer than that of flu.  Symptoms of coronavirus can persist for several weeks to a month, while the flu typically lasts about 5 days. 

It seems inevitable that this virus will begin to spread in regional outbreaks outside of the highly impacted areas of China, South Korea, Iran, & Italy so personally I'm beginning to feel concerned about planning any kind of travel.

For some perspective on just how fast that is, coronavirus is around 7.

For the horror of how fast this is, if H7N9 evolved human to human transmission (CFR of 20-50%) tomorrow tens of thousands at a minimum would be sentenced to die before we could roll out a vaccine that is already more or less ready to go. And that's ignoring coronavirus.

In practical terms if an influenza outbreak had started December 1, with the first known case, with a CFR of 2% you would quite probably know someone who had died of it.

You can't compare which is deadlier like that because this moves much slower. But that doesn't mean it's not going to get there. They don't lock down cities in the free world for the flu."

Her firm‚Äôs 100 outlets have been closed for about a month because of the coronavirus, cash reserves are dwindling and banks are reluctant to extend deadlines on billions of yuan in debt coming due over the next few months. There are also other creditors to think about.

‚ÄúIf we can‚Äôt pay back the bonds, it will be very, very bad,‚Äù said Brigita, whose company has 10,000 employees and sells mid- to high-end car brands such as BMWs. She asked that only her first name be used and that her firm not be identified because she isn‚Äôt authorized to speak to the press.

With much of China‚Äôs economy still¬†idled¬†as authorities try to contain an epidemic that has infected more than 75,000 people, millions of companies across the country are in a race against the clock to stay afloat.

A survey of small- and medium-sized Chinese companies conducted this month showed that a third of respondents only had enough cash to cover fixed expenses for a month, with another third running out within two months. Only 30% of such firms have managed to resume operations due to a complicated local government approval procedure as well as a lack of employees and financing, a government official said at a press conference on Monday.

While China‚Äôs government has cut interest rates, ordered banks to boost lending and¬†loosenedcriteria for companies to restart operations, many of the nation‚Äôs private businesses say they‚Äôve been unable to access the funding they need to meet upcoming deadlines for debt and salary payments. Without more financial support or a sudden rebound in China‚Äôs economy, some may have to shut for good.

‚ÄúIf China fails to contain the virus in the first quarter, I expect a vast number of small businesses would go under,‚Äù said Lv Changshun, an analyst at Beijing Zhonghe Yingtai Management Consultant Co.

Fighting for Survival

Most small- and medium-sized firms say they will run out of cash in months

Chinese Association of Small and Medium Enterprises

Survey is based on responses from 6,422 firms as of Feb. 14

Despite accounting for 60% of the economy and 80% of jobs in China, private businesses have long struggled to tap funding to help them expand during booms and survive crises. About two-thirds of the country‚Äôs 80 million small businesses, including many mom-and-pop shops, lacked access to loans as of 2018, according to China‚Äôs National Institution for Finance & Development.

President Xi Jinping over the weekend¬†pledged a greater focus on reviving the economy, with a more proactive fiscal policy, accelerated construction projects and freer reserves for commercial lenders to unleash more funding.

Support from China‚Äôs banking giants in response to the outbreak has so far been piecemeal, mostly earmarked for directly combating the virus. Industrial & Commercial Bank of China Ltd., the nation‚Äôs largest lender, has offered relief to about 5% of its small business clients.

In an emailed response to questions from Bloomberg News, ICBC said it has allocated 5.4 billion yuan ($770 million) to help companies fight the virus. ‚ÄúWe approve qualified small businesses‚Äô loan applications as soon as they arrive,‚Äù the bank said.

As a group, Chinese banks had offered about 794 billion yuan in loans related to the containment effort as of Feb. 20, according to the banking industry association, with foreign lenders such as¬†Citigroup Inc.¬†also lowering rates. To put that into perspective, China‚Äôs small businesses typically face interest payments on about 36.9 trillion yuan of loans every quarter.

Stringent requirements and shortlists restrict who can access special loans earmarked by the central bank for virus-related businesses, while local governments and banks have imposed caps on the amounts, according to people familiar with the matter. A debt banker at one of China‚Äôs largest brokerages said his firm opened a fast lane to ease debt sales by businesses involved in the containment effort, with borrowers required to prove they will use at least 10% of the proceeds to fight the disease.

That‚Äôs of little help to a car dealership. Brigita, whose firm owes money to dozens of banks, said she has so far only reached an agreement with a handful to extend payment deadlines by two months. For now, the company is still paying salaries.

Liquidity Squeeze

China's private sector bond issuance falls below maturities in February

Source: China Lianhe Credit Rating Co

Note: Data are as of Feb. 18.

Many of China‚Äôs businesses were¬†already grasping for lifelines¬†before the virus hit, pummeled by a trade war and lending crackdown that sent economic growth to a three-decade low last year.

At most risk are the labor-intensive catering and restaurant industries, travel agencies, airlines, hotels and shopping malls, according to Lianhe Rating.

Yang, a property manager of a seven-story mall in Shanghai, says a tenant who runs a 150-room hotel that‚Äôs usually busy has called asking for a month‚Äôs rent waiver after business dried up. She expects the massage parlor that rents space in the mall is also struggling and is open to extending some help.

A deputy financing director at a small developer in central Anhui province said his firm is even being denied loans under existing credit lines. A drop in sales has hurt the company‚Äôs credit profile and a dearth of new projects means there‚Äôs no collateral to put up. Without access to credit, the business can survive for about four months, or maybe longer if some payments can be delayed, he said.

Banks are hardly any better off themselves. Many are under-capitalized and on the ropes after two years of record debt defaults. Rating firm¬†S&P Global¬†has estimated that a prolonged emergency could cause the banking system‚Äôs bad loan ratio to more than triple to about 6.3%, amounting to an increase of 5.6 trillion yuan.

Wu Hai, owner of Mei KTV, a chain of 100 Karaoke bars across China, took to the nation‚Äôs premier outlet of discontent, social media platform WeChat, to voice his despair.

KTV‚Äôs bars have been closed by the government because of the virus, choking off its cash flow. The special loans from the authorities will be of little help and no bank will provide a loan without enough collateral and cash flow, he said on his official WeChat account earlier this month.

Wu couldn‚Äôt be reached for a direct comment, but on WeChat he gave himself two months before he has to shutter his business."""

Other critical infrastructure, such as law enforcement, emergency medical services, and transportation industry may also be affected. Health care providers and hospitals may be overwhelmed."" (https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/summary.html)

Not to mention that healthcare workers on the front lines will start to be exhausted or fall ill, and lord knows most places already stretch their doctors and nurses too thin. Worse case scenario appears to be that COVID19 outpaces all efforts to contain or combat it, and it becomes an enormous waiting game for healthier people to wait it out while those most affected are left to die.

But I've heard a few comments from virologists that the virus seems capable of changing quickly and that it should actually become less deadly over time because it would survive better by not harming its hosts. So I'd like to think the severity of the virus will go down even as it spreads further? The only absolute truth is that no one can confidently say what will happen in a week or a month from now."

Fundamentally, [everybody knows a crash is coming](https://www.axios.com/investors-stocks-overvalued-recession-looming-3f6ae308-4842-49df-b398-698b8beb97db.html), and the only thing keeping them in the market is that people are still buying.

It's also almost entirely localized (~98%) to China with deaths and spread likely being inflated due to poor response and poor conditions. Even with that deaths have been around 1 in 100 with recoveries already hitting 1 in 10 and rising.

I think it should be taken seriously, people should be concerned about hygiene and not travel if they are feeling sick or are at risk for complications, but this is pretty much the same concern we should be taking every flu season as well but people for some reason aren't scared about the flu.

Well, not fine as in business as usual, but fine as in I won't die and society won't completely collapse. 

But over the weekend concerning developments have happened.

(Note: I'm not looking up sources. Most of them are ""other subreddits"" so take that as you will)

* Dr John Campbell on Youtube has been making daily videos covering this. His tone has gotten quite a bit more negative/concerned of late. He was very much the stoic, moderate Brit when he started. Yesterday he openly scoffed at the NHS claiming they were prepared, and openly criticized the WHO for fucking this all up
* Relatedly, he claims he has contacts in Iran who are reporting that the death rate is quote ""considerably higher than 3%"". He says this is unconfirmed, but that he received reports from two different contacts, who both quoted similar numbers, and are not in communication with each other. How much of this is because of bad hospitals vs the existing public numbers being lies? And if it's bad hospitals, does it matter? If 5000 sick people show up at my doctor's office, very few will get medical treatment. 
* Saw a tweet last night purporting to show people randomly keeling over and dying in the street in Iran, similar to what we saw in China
* Saw a tweet this morning purporting to show a caucasian Canadian citizen, 38 y/o, keeling over and dying in the street in Thailand(?). So much for the ""white people immune""
* Explosion of cases in Italy, with the seemingly higher fatality rate. I have not seen any demographic data, so I don't know how to update in terms of risk to me. I also don't know what level of selection bias there is (for all we know, literally everyone already has it and 99.9999% of the cases nobody notices). 
* Italy going full on Wuhan-style no-in-no-out lockdown on their infected cities. Granted these are more like villages than cities, but given the lackadaisical reaction of western governments I had almost allowed myself to think that China was overreacting. This just got a lot more real for me. 
* Panic-buying emptying the shelves everywhere in Italy. I suppose this could be worse than it sounds, if three days from now all the stores are re-stocked. I'm provisioned to _survive_ without access to groceries for a month, but I won't like it. And should something like that happen near me I am confident I will have a full on panic attack at the prospect of thousands of rabid normies and who knows what happens then. 
* Explosion of cases in South Korea. This looks like it might be a one-off due to that church, and maybe shouldn't be updated on
* Continuing to see rumours of [Antibody-mediated Enhancement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibody-dependent_enhancement) and if that's true, this is an X-risk to humanity given how infective it is
* Rumours that this virus parasitizes a common gut bacteria, turning them into virus factories that are outside the ability of your immune system to defeat. This was a google scholar paper, but I am not equipped to judge it. This is claimed to explain the inconsistent testing (the virus isn't in your body yet, just in your GI tract) as well as the very long incubation period (it infects your gut bacteria, chills there for a few weeks, and then once it builds up enough it infects you). 
* Reminded of the 'it also attacks the heart' rumours
* Rumours of cases in the US with media being formally suppressed/testing being denied. Can't take proper protective measures if I don't know where and when it is
* Rumours of cases in Canada with media being formally suppressed/testing being denied. I have also heard a few people online claiming to be in Vancouver reporting what sounds very obviously like nCoV (younger people getting sick and developing pneumonia three days later) who claim that Canada is refusing to test them _and also not quarantining them or doing any other protective measures_
* The head of Australia's medical system on Twitter(?) saying that they are _**already**_ running out of PPE and they don't even have an epidemic there yet. 
* Realized that not only is my mom well within the vulnerable age range, and not in great health, she's also a smoker. If my parents get infected, my mom is highly likely to die. I don't think she realizes this, and I don't know what to do / how to talk to her about this from afar without just making her panic. 
* Commentary that ~80% of medications and pharmaceutical inputs are made in China, and that the US is going to start seeing general shortages of all kinds of medications in about a month. Something like 10% of Americans take SSRIs. What's going to happen when they all suddenly have to quit cold turkey? Deaths from suicides will dramatically eclipse deaths from Coronavirus. 
* Expectation that any day now the market is going to tank and we're going to go into a general recession. WTF do I do with my investments to protect them? Current plan is to HODL and hope the US economy bounces back afterwards, but fuck if I know
* Realization that if there's a general recession I will probably lose my job, I will probably be unable to get a new job, and I will be forced to leave the US and go back to Canada, which would be stressful under good conditions but the last thing I want to do is deal with an international move during a crisis. Not to mention... I have close to zero faith in Manitoba's medical system. 

Pretty much the only cause for _good_ news I see right now is Singapore. Somehow, they seem to have avoided the explosion of cases that other countries have seen and, as far as I know, everyone still believes that their government is being very transparent about cases. Perhaps this is evidence that the hotter temperatures _do_ slow the spread? If that's the case... all we have to do in Texas is make it to April. 

I burnt out all my panic a month ago when, ironically, it was not yet time to panic. I'm wondering if it's going to become time to panic in the near future"

**Article**:

> DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) ‚Äî Iran‚Äôs government said Monday that 12 people had died nationwide from the new coronavirus, rejecting claims of a much higher death toll by a lawmaker from the city of Qom that has been at the epicenter of the virus in the country.

> The conflicting reports raised questions about the Iranian government‚Äôs transparency concerning the scale of the outbreak.

> Five neighboring countries reported their first cases of the virus, with those infected all having links to Iran, including direct travel from a city where authorities have not even reported a confirmed case.

> Iran‚Äôs Health Ministry said the total number of infections have risen to 61 while deaths stood at 12. But a lawmaker from Qom, Ahmad Amirabadi Farahani, was quoted by the semi-official ILNA news agency as saying that the death toll was 50.

> Even with the lower toll of 12, the number of deaths compared to the number of confirmed infections from the virus is higher in Iran than in any other country, including China and South Korea, where the outbreak is far more widespread. 

> The World Health Organization said last week that in 2% of infected cases, the virus has been fatal. In Iran, according to the Health Ministry‚Äôs figures, the death toll represents nearly 20% of total infections.

> There are concerns that clusters of the new coronavirus in Iran, as well as in Italy and South Korea, could signal a serious new stage in its global spread.

> Authorities in Iraq and Afghanistan, which closed their borders with Iran, announced their first confirmed coronavirus cases on Monday. Kuwait, Bahrain and Oman also announced their first cases. In all five countries, the infected patients had links with Iran. 

> Farahani, the lawmaker, said the 50 deaths in Qom date back to Feb. 13. Iran first officially reported cases of the virus and its first deaths on Feb. 19.

> He did not provide supporting evidence but said more than 250 people are quarantined in Qom, which is known for its Shiite seminaries that attract students from across Iran and other countries. Schools there have been closed. 

> ‚ÄúI think the performance of the administration in controlling the virus has not been successful,‚Äù Farahani said, referring to the government of President Hassan Rouhani. His comments represent the most public criticism levied yet against the government for its handling of the virus, which originated in China in December. 

> ‚ÄúNone of the nurses have access to proper protective gear,‚Äù Farahani said, adding that some health care specialists had left the city. ‚ÄúSo far, I have not seen any particular action to confront corona by the administration.‚Äù

> He spoke following a session in parliament in Tehran. His comments, first published by ILNA, were later carried by other news agencies in Iran. 

> While such harsh criticism is rare in the country, it reflects deep-seated public mistrust of the government, particularly since a Ukrainian passenger jet was shot down by Iran on Jan. 8, killing 176 on board amid heightened tensions with the U.S. Iranian government officials at first tried to conceal the cause of the crash before acknowledging that Revolutionary Guard forces had shot it down, mistaking it for an enemy target.

> Health Ministry spokesman Iraj Harirchi rejected the lawmaker‚Äôs comments, but said about 900 other suspected cases are being tested.

> ‚ÄúNo one is qualified to discuss this sort of news at all,‚Äù Harirchi said, adding that lawmakers have no access to coronavirus statistics and could be mixing figures on deaths related to other diseases like the flu with the new virus.

> The virus, which causes the COVID-19 illness, has infected more than 79,000 people globally, and caused more than 2,600 deaths, most of them in China. 

> Ian Mackay, who studies viruses at Australia‚Äôs University of Queensland said the latest figures reported mean that ‚ÄúIran could become the hot spot for seeding countries that have travel with Iran ... a source outside of China.‚Äù

> Travelers from Iran with the virus have been confirmed in Canada, Lebanon and the United Arab Emirates.

> The outbreak of the virus in Iran comes as its economy buckles under pressure from U.S. economic sanctions. The virus threatens to isolate Iran even further as several countries began halting flights and barring Iranians from entry.

> The head of the WHO expressed concern over the virus‚Äô spread in Iran, as well as in Italy where more than 200 have tested positive and five h...

SARS, MERS and Ebola all came with these absurd amount of scare-mongering tactics from the media. Nightmare fuel and then eradicated.

As we are seeing with Coronavirus here in the West, there has been an opposite experience. Virtually no media coverage at all up until recently.

The narrative has been shifting from ""just a flu"" to ""only in China"" to ""it is going to be a pandemic and there is nothing we can do about it.""

Considering this article:

How will it change how we live, work, socialize and travel? Don‚Äôt get all disaster-movie here. Some people seem to have the notion that a pandemic will mean shutting down borders, building walls, canceling all air travel and quarantining entire nations indefinitely. That is entirely incorrect.

A pandemic is coming. I recognize that may sound like irresponsible scaremongering. I strongly encourage you to be skeptical, to read widely, and to draw your own conclusions. But the clamor of expert voices is growing too loud to ignore.

Don‚Äôt panic. There is a great deal we can and will do to limit and mitigate this pandemic.

But it will be very far from the end of the world. I suspect we‚Äôll all be surprised by how soon it begins to feel almost normal.

This is utter bullshit.

We went from hearing absolutely nothing about this virus to ""it wont be that bad"" to ""well, this is our reality and we will get used to it and deal with it.""

Imagine telling the people of Wuhan or Italy or Iran to ""deal with it.""

Tell all those people on the Diamond Princess about their ""new normal.""

The shifting of this narrative leads me to believe this was, in fact, a bioweapon that leaked from a lab. All governments know it and they are trying to spin in."

A set of towels from my fianc√©'s aunt and uncle who live in Australia and aren't coming to the wedding. Wondering if I should have sent more invitations to people who wouldn't have come!

On Saturday my dress came in the post!! Hooray! I was expecting to wait at least a couple more weeks for it. Unfortunately it needs taking in so that's another thing on the to-do list. It was weird to try on the dress with the accessories I have got so far (shoes, headband). It didn't totally look how I had imagined it; I am not great at creating an exact picture in my mind. Still good though I think!

One thing that has NOT arrived in a timely fashion is my new glasses, I ordered them off Select Specs and apparently the coronavirus has been affecting their production in China. Hope I don't have to wait too much longer; at least I got around to ordering them in fairly good time. I do NOT want to still be getting used to wearing them on the wedding day.

Yesterday we went to see a cake maker and if we do order one it'll probably be from her (because she's the only one who's actually responded to my emails and is in budget.) But I tossed and turned all night thinking about it. Trying to decide what we would even ask for from her vs. getting a cheaper cake from M&S vs. no cake at all and just serve dessert.

The thing is up until now my fianc√© has taken a very relaxed approach to finances and said everything I ask for is fine. (He's the one paying for almost everything because he makes all the money.) All of a sudden he's panicking because of course, we have a lot of expenses coming up at once, and has started questioning all my/our purchases. But we KNEW we were going to have a lot of expenses coming up at once. And we can still pay for them (credit card, selling a few company shares.) So I don't think anything has changed. But he's got me feeling guilty for all the little things I still want to get. Well, I mean, I can not buy him the cufflinks I was going to surprise him with... I can't be sure at this time whether he would be happy I bought him a thoughtful gift or annoyed I spent the money!

point being, by that time this case was confirmed coronavirus was already a big enough deal for china to have placed 60 million people under complete and total lockdown in hubei province.  this alone should tell you that this thing is no fucking flu.  that's like, last resort.

this lady is from hubei according to this:

but yes, if an american or African or anyone else was living in an area that was the obvious epicenter of what is now a scary fucking viral pandemic, and they jumped out of that epicenter just before a lockdown so they can go on holiday, then yes i would consider them irresponsible, selfish, and stupid all the same.  does that mean i'm not racist here?  sorry, i know you wanted this to be an anti-asian racism thing.  it's not."

Coronavirus carriers can be asymptomatic for up to two weeks. That means you have no way of knowing if someone does or doesn't have the virus until it's way way way too late. 

Measures like washing hands, wearing masks, disinfecting surfaces... that's useful for avoiding accidental transmission in normal public places (eg. someone sneezes on a coffee shop counter, you touch that counter, then you touch your mouth). By all accounts coronovirus is pretty contagious, and a 5 minute roll in super close proximity with someone who is infected but not showing any symptoms is almost guaranteed to infect you AFAIK.

And regardless of your immune system, what about when you carry it and give it to your friend/mother/elderly relative/kid? 

Practice good hygiene yes, but I'd say above all, follow local government advice and consider avoiding rolling if you're near an outbreak."

Fundamentals are still sound.  Coronavirus is a fraud.  It's on par with Influenza as far as incidence of death.

Not to mention, if your symptoms are mild, you don't even go in for a test.  It's a good idea to track this virus, but let's not blow this out of proportion folks."

There's not only the flu to check, by the way, but this virus could pass as a respiratory illness like pneumonia in older people, and it can cause even other illnesses.

A pandemic is when an infectious disease spreads easily from person to person in many parts of the world.

More cases of the virus, which causes respiratory disease Covid-19, continue to emerge, with outbreaks in South Korea, Italy and Iran causing concern.

However, most infections are in China, the original source of the virus, where 77,000 people have the disease and nearly 2,600 have died. The number of new cases there is now falling.

More than 1,200 cases have been confirmed in about 30 other countries and there have been more than 20 deaths. Italy reported three more deaths on Monday, raising the total there to six.

US insulin (Humalog and Novolog at least) comes from Denmark, France, Puerto Rico, or other various locations in the US. I've never heard of any part of the supply chain being in China, I can't find any reputable claims to such, and the manufacture is basically a two step process (Crystals are made in bulk, then those crystals are added to a liquid in vials or pens) so it's unlikely that COVID-19 will manage to shut down ""the supply chain"" such as it is.

Coronavirus, in Italy infections doubled in 24 hours: we are the third in the world for the number of people affected
The epidemic map: 153 the infected. Peak in Lombardy, new cases in Veneto, Piedmont and Emilia Romagna

More than double the number of infections in 24 hours. 76 to 153. The coronavirus advances, leaving behind a trail of panic, of pain for the three victims and of concern, even internationally. Italy is in fact in third place behind China (78,811 cases of contagion, 2,462 deaths) and South Korea (602 sick, 4 deaths) in the world ranking of outbreaks of Covid-19 (data updated to February 23, 2020). Three days were enough to climb it.

An evolving picture, with increasing numbers in the affected regions: 116 cases of contagion in Lombardy (including 2 deaths), with three positive ones in Milan - one of which is a polyclinic dermatologist who was then treated at Sacco, but there is apprehension for an employee of the Unicredit office, subjected to analysis in the same hospital, where tests are underway on 36 people -, 49 in Lodi and province (starting from Codogno and around the town, in the red zone), 14 in Cremona, six in Pavia, three in Bergamo, one in Sondrio and one in Monza. The list also includes the three infected, belonging to the same family, brought by ambulance to Lombardy from a holiday in Trentino. There is concern even if the Provincial Health Services Agency of Trento has started a series of investigations to reconstruct the family's movements: he would not have had many contacts and would have spent most of his stay in a rented apartment on the plateau."

2) evitare i contatti ravvicinati con le persone che soffrono di infezioni respiratorie,  
3) non toccarsi occhi, naso e bocca con le mani,

A lot of people say the death rate is lower because some people are recovering without being officially diagnosed, which means there are even more cases there.

It's at 09:24 on [this thread.](https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/feb/24/coronavirus-live-updates-china-wuhan-hubei-latest-news-italy-lombardy-south-korea-iran-japan-cases-infections-death-toll-outbreak-xi-jinping-update)

Moreover people say that in the summer the disease will die down, however Qom in Iran is 19c today and the virus is doing fine. 

So yeah I'm worried too!

One thing that really helps me is [this tracker](https://gisanddata.maps.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html#/bda7594740fd40299423467b48e9ecf6). It gives official numbers updated daily. I find knowing the reality keeps me from blowing it out of proportion. However this thing is big.

I would also say it's important to ""self comfort"" over this. Being worried or panicked isn't going to help you. Just stay calm, follow official instructions and make sure you have a good internet connection if there is going to be an extended lockdown.

You think Amazon is going to be selling you a sweet suction cupped horse cock for your shower wall if China slaves are locked up in their ‚Äúapartments‚Äù instead of chained to their command posts slavin‚Äô away?

I don't think it's that scary. If you're scared by it, that's your right, but don't spread your own fears. If you're scared by the coronavirus you should be scared by the flu as it's deadlier. But you can't blame the flu on a race so OP isn't doing it. It's just a virus, basic hygiene and a mediocre immune system will keep you fine.

2020-02-24,Jammy_buttons2,singapore,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/f8pdde/no_proof_of_asymptomatic_transmission_of/fimomsz/," 

SINGAPORE - There is no robust proof that the coronavirus can be  spread by someone with no symptoms of the disease, said Dr Shawn Vasoo,  clinical director of the National Centre for Infectious Diseases (NCID).

A letter in the New England Journal Of Medicine on Jan 30 saying that  this has happened has since been proven to be wrong, he said.

The letter by doctors from the University Hospital of Ludwig  Maximilian University of Munich had said a German businessman had caught  the infection from a Chinese woman whom he had met when she was in  Germany.

They said the woman had only become sick on her flight home to Shanghai and was later found to be infected with the coronavirus.

This had led to fears of asymptomatic transmission, which would be difficult to stem.

However, it later transpired that the doctors had not spoken to the  woman at all, and had merely taken the German man's word that she had  been well when they had met.

However, when she was interviewed in Shanghai, she disclosed that she had been sick while in Germany.

Since then, there have been other anecdotal reports, including a  letter in the Journal Of The American Medical Association on Feb 21 by a  team of doctors from China.

They described five members of a family in Anyang, China, who were [infected by another family member who was ""presumed"" asymptomatic](https://www.straitstimes.com/asia/east-asia/wuhan-woman-with-no-symptoms-infects-five-relatives-with-coronavirus-study). She had been in Wuhan, where the family and the doctors believe she was infected by the virus.

However, the doctors, who¬†were more cautious in claiming it as an  asymptomatic transmission, said: ""The sequence of events suggests that  the coronavirus may have been transmitted by the asymptomatic carrier.""

Dr Vasoo said this report is limited in that is not so clear about  whether the patient in question had infected the others, or was infected  by them. It was presumed that she was the source of the infection  simply because she had been to Wuhan, [the outbreak's epicentre](https://www.straitstimes.com/asia/east-asia/coronavirus-locked-in-wuhan-residents-adapt-to-find-food).

He added that in this case: ""Environmental contamination or exposure to other infected persons cannot be excluded.""

The director of the US Centres for Disease Control and Prevention, Dr  Robert Redfield, had also said in an interview with CNN about a week  back that the virus can be spread by someone with no symptoms.

But¬†he said¬†this belief was based on information from his colleagues in China.

Dr Vasoo said that as far as is currently known, ""transmission is predominantly still through symptomatic persons"".

Some who are said to be ""asymptomatic"" may actually have ""mild symptoms that people do not make much of"", he said.

He added: ""While it is plausible that viral diseases may transmit in  varying degrees and durations in the pre-symptomatic phase, we do not  have robust data that it happens or to what extent it is for Covid-19."""

2. ATTENTION ON VOUS MENT!! (Au passage, rappel que tu va crever quand meme, juste pas immediatement.)
3. Rien ne vaut une bonne vielle revolution, pas grand chose a dire la.
4. Pollution (Voir ""On va tous mourrir"")
5. Meta
6. Culture (... voir 1)
7. Pas grand chose a dire, ca semble etre un bon gouter
8. Ah bah voila, on y retourne, au ""On va tous crever""!
9. Laisse moi t'expliquer pourquoi absolument TOUT va mal!
10. ... ATTENTION, ON VA CRAMER!!
11. On vit la periode la plus paisible de l'histoire, mais laisse moi te rappeler que c'est QUAND MEME de la merde (Meme si en pratique, on est pas vraiment sur qu'elle augmente, ou si c'est juste qu'il y a moin eu de refus de plainte...)
12. Attentat, bon, au dela de l'ambience du subs, c'est une actualite recente qui a au moin le merite d'etre utile, on va pas dire grand chose dessus, enfin, tant que t'ouvre pas les commentaires digne du Figaro.
13. Je suis pas sur que tu a compris, ON VA CREVER MEC...
14. ... PLUS RAPIDEMENT QUE TU NE LE CROIS!!!
15. Meta
16. Ici
17. Culture
18. Un fait divers pour te rappeler qu'on vit au pire heures de l'histoire (Voir 11.)
19. Actualite, comme pour 12 pas grand chose a dire.
20. LA MORT! ELLE ARRIVE! PAR BUS! DEPUIS LYON!

Et encore, pour le moment, c'est plutot soft, probablement parceque on est encore au milleux de la journee, habituellement tu a aussi les deux extremes qui viennent ce battre a coup de fait-divers.

Pour les posteur, je vous assure, on a compris que la situation est dramatique cote climatique, je vois jure! le truc c'est que spammer la frontpage d'r/france d'actualite en rapport ne ... fait rien d'utile en fait, le public d'r/france, c'est pas vraiment celui qui peut y faire quoi que ce soit.

Quand au coronavirus, oui, on a compris que c'etait dangereux, certain l'ont moin compris certe, mais en fait il y a pas grand chose a dire autre que ""Bah, si vous avez de la fievre, consulter, sinon laver vous les main et eviter de vous les lecher..."""
