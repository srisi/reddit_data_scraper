They are not going to be in a position of begging or bribing others for masks in an emergency.

China already has this policy.

The US is also learning it needs the security of self sufficiency in this product, and that is OK.  

We should be working with close allies like Canada, and maybe have a trusted relationship of mutual security in this, but we cannot be in a place where a million Americans die because we lost a game of musical chairs with masks due to depending on supplies from China"

Yeah which is why it's important not to let the negligent leaders who allowed this to happen use China as a scapegoat for all of it. China does have plenty to answer for, but this is \*so\* much bigger than them.

The wet markets are another reason this can't become a scapegoating project; yes, the animals in those markets are a serious problem. But there are markets like that elsewhere in Asia too. Bush meat in Africa is a real problem. Factory farming, especially in the US, is a real problem.

Public spaces including streets, train stations and toilets are clean  without trash. It’s difficult to find trash boxes in the streets  because people are encouraged to take garbage back home.

* The U.S. government (including the CDC, FEMA, etc) does not have the authority to enact a national quarantine or any other measures on a national level with the exception of matters pertaining to interstate travel and/or federal lands.
* That being said, the CDC is not in charge of testing. They can ask states to report numbers, delay information, etc. However, they do not have any legal authority over states with the exceptions I listed above.
* Within limits, the US government has the power to regulate interstate commerce, which does give them a bit of power over some (nearly all republican, coincidentally?) states. States like NY and CA can tell the feds to fuck off, because they *pay in more federal taxes than they receive*. In theory, any state in this position could freeze federal income tax indefinitely. I don’t believe any state has ever attempted this, however.
* All that being said, it is your state’s responsibility to prevent catastrophe, *not the feds*. The federal government does pitch in money to help various states, but that is only because the vast majority of states take more money than they pay. Most of the US is propped up by the 5-10 most populous states in the US."

Beijing, West Railway Station 

&#x200B;

A journey from Beijing to Wuhan 

&#x200B;

Bernhard Zand, correspondent of DER SPIEGEL

""I must now replace the normal mask with one of these. The train crew will provide it for you. The gentlemen are extremely polite and obliging. ""This is because there are far fewer people on this train than usual."" 

&#x200B;

The train crew takes the temperature of the passengers 

&#x200B;

Bernhard Zand, correspondent of DER SPIEGE

""We are on our way from Beijing to Wuhan, the epicenter of the Corona crisis. For a few days now, it's been possible to go there in principle, now even for foreigners like me. It's not easy for me to leave Beijing. Because Beijing is a city that is slowly coming to its senses, where there is a certain optimism. But of course we're even more interested in what the situation is like in Wuhan at the moment, 60 days after the total closure of the city. And so we are now on our way from Beijing West Station to Wuhan. That's about 200 miles. We're on one of those Chinese bullet trains. Normally, there are 500 to 530 people on this train. The train is much less crowded this time, it's about 150. You have to go through many, many checkpoints until you are allowed to enter, especially as a foreigner. You have to prove exactly where you have been. I have the impression that there is not really much going on around Beijing. But down here, if you look out now, the tractors are on the road. One also has the impression that the irrigation systems are already working again. Eight weeks after the corona crisis became known, China has by no means returned to normality, but the country is slowly getting back on track. 

&#x200B;

Wuhan, Hubei province. 

&#x200B;

Bernhard Zand, correspondent of DER SPIEGEL

""Wuhan is one of the most important, if not the most important traffic junction of the Chinese railway network. Trains thunder through here all the time. Every minute, the large high-speed trains arrive on the east-west axis Shanghai-Chengdu, from the north-south axis Beijing - Zhengzhou - Guangdong down towards Hong Kong. But very few people can only get off here at the moment. Very few people can only get on the train because of course the other provinces are all focused on what happened here in Wuhan. And the people who are now allowed to leave Hubei slowly are not very welcome in the other provinces. 

&#x200B;

Yangtze River, Wuhan 

&#x200B;

""Wuhan, it seems to me, is a city in mourning, in great darkness. ""It's a bit like the weather. It's not unusual, though. We are standing here on the Yangtze, the great Chinese river, and the weather is often as similar as it is here at this time of year. But it also fits with the news. The city administration of Wuhan has today once again urged the people of the city to persevere and not to go outside at least until April 8th, when Wuhan is also to be opened, to be careful, this is very hard on the people of Wuhan, because they have been completely sealed off for eight weeks now. 

&#x200B;

The exit restrictions are still strict.

&#x200B;

There are numerous checkpoints.

&#x200B;

Those who want to go out need a health certificate by QR code.

&#x200B;

Ms. Lu, grocery store owner

""Because nobody works, nobody has an income. Life is hard. If the situation stays like this for a long time, it's not good for anyone. If the city is kept in lockdown even longer."" 

&#x200B;

Bernard Zand

""Tomorrow is also the Qingming rock. This is the Chinese commemoration of the dead, comparable to our European All Saints' Day or All Souls' Day. And this day is to be celebrated, at least I have not yet experienced it in China, for the first time as a kind of national day of mourning, state day of mourning. In the morning at ten in China the flags are set at half-mast. A moment of silence, of silence is to be observed. We will see this tomorrow. Signs of this Qingming festival can already be seen today. We were standing here on the Yangtze River. You can see this here: Some chrysanthemums are already floating by. According to official figures, more than 3200 people have died of Covid-19 disease in China, 2500 of them in Wuhan alone. These are the official figures. Whether they are equally correct, we do not know. But the ratio will be about right. And that can give you an idea of how hard hit, how traumatized this city is by what's happened here in the last three months.""

Imagine if they told the truth. Imagine if we had a 1 or even 2 month head start. 

I will list as many reasons as I can remember. Each one of these can very easily be interdependently researched on google.

1. [Chinese wet markets have been the cause of the last 3 viral outbreaks](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16940861)
2. [China knew about the virus spreading back in november](https://www.livescience.com/first-case-coronavirus-found.html)
3. China knew the virus could spread human to human in december
4. [China told WHO in January that the virus does not stransfer human to human](https://www.hudson.org/research/15886-china-lied-about-human-to-human-transfer-of-coronavirus)
5. [In january and Febuary 2 chinese companies based out of Australia started buying/sourcing every single bit of medical equipment they could from australia and other countries and had it sent to china. This left many countries short on medical supplies.](https://www.dailyexaminer.com.au/news/90-tonnes-of-supplies-shipped-to-china/3983282/)
6. They knew it was going to be bad and they lied about it the whole time so they could get the supplies they wanted. This delayed the response of other major countries like Italy, Spain, USA.
7. [In Italy they even had a ""Hug a Chinese"" event in the beginning of Febuary](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNMdg4morQs)
8. [China sends faulty tests across the world, working only 30% of the time.](https://www.businessinsider.com/coronavirus-spain-says-rapid-tests-sent-from-china-missing-cases-2020-3)
9. [China is sending out faulty medical equipment, people told not to use their masks](https://nypost.com/2020/03/31/china-exporting-faulty-medical-equipment-as-manufacturing-rebounds/)
10. [China tries to blame the USA for the virus](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/13/world/asia/coronavirus-china-conspiracy-theory.html)
11. Strange how all their stuff used to be fine but all of a sudden nothing works right.

I feel for the Chinese people. They're living under a communist dictatorship. There are many many horrible things going on there like [concentration camps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xinjiang_re-education_camps) and [organ harvesting from prisoners](https://www.forbes.com/sites/zakdoffman/2019/11/16/china-covers-up-killing-of-prisoners-to-harvest-organs-for-transplant-new-report/#62936fd92ec7).  Its not the people of China, Its their communist government. Screw the CCP!

So he kept saying it's not in his state (when they weren't even testing there yet), then not in his county, then only a handful, then maybe more than a handful but at least not any in his town. Having confirmed cases in his neighborhood made him confront the reality that it's there and he puts himself at risk each time he goes out into the community.

[In the Midst of the Coronavirus Pandemic, Construction Is Set to Resume on the Keystone Pipeline](https://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/in-the-midst-of-the-coronavirus-pandemic-construction-is-set-to-resume-on-the-keystone-pipeline)

From the article:

> Over the past few weeks, [the Oil Industry] has been working to push through construction of the Keystone XL pipeline. The effort began in earnest in mid-March, when several states—including, crucially, South Dakota, which is on the KXL route—passed laws designating pipelines as “critical infrastructure.” South Dakota’s governor went further last week, signing a law that could charge anyone who, with three or more others, acts to cause “damage to property” as a rioter, and made it a felony to “incite” such behavior.

This is a direct attack on the Tribes of SD by the SD and US government at a time when they are busy trying to protect their communities from the COVID-19 virus. Noem is a coward and should be charged with war crimes against humanity, along with the foreign and domestic industry ties that are pushing this. Make no mistake, the EPA is choosing to turn a blind eye at this moment for this exact reason.

[Keystone XL Pipeline Construction to Forge Ahead During Coronavirus Pandemic](https://www.ecowatch.com/keystone-xl-pipeline-construction-2645607020.html)

From the article:

> This is a shameful new low,"" Sierra Club's Beyond Dirty Fuels campaign associate director Catherine Collentine said in a statement reported by The Hill. ""By barreling forward with construction during a global pandemic, TC Energy is putting already vulnerable communities at even greater risk.""

> The pipeline has long faced opposition from environmentalists who say it promotes the use of especially dirty tar sands oil in a time of climate crisis, and indigenous and local communities who oppose its construction on their land.

[Disputed Canada-US oil pipeline work to start in April](https://apnews.com/f7b4a06d43cad4fb761c50c025abf893)

From the article:

> Despite plunging oil prices in recent weeks, Alberta Premier Jason Kenney said the province’s resource-dependent economy could not afford for Keystone XL to be delayed until after the coronavirus pandemic and a global economic downturn have passed.
“This investment in Keystone XL is a bold move to retake control of our province’s economic destiny and put it firmly back in the hands of the owners of our natural resources, the people of Alberta,” Kenney said.

> “We thank U.S. President Donald Trump and Alberta Premier Jason Kenney as well as many government officials across North America for their advocacy without which, individually and collectively, this project could not have advanced,” TC Energy chief executive Russ Girling said in a statement.

This is classic, gloves-off colonialism in the modern era. This is why Noem and other governments have continued to downplay the pandemic. They are setting the stage for Keystone XL to proceed without interference while rural and Tribal communities are disproportionately overwhelmed by the virus and at the mercy of the Fed. This is after the Republicans argued in favor of providing $0 in the relief bill passed last week into law. They ultimately failed but the message is clear. This is war on our water protectors by a cowardly group who hide behind the worst crisis this country has faced in almost a century."

The problem that you are identifying there is clearly the job of the legislature, and the executive branch's hands are largely tied. 

And none of that is related to my point.

You can identify the specific decisions of the Trump administration to fire experts, not hire replacements, ignore experts, push the problem under the rug, and fail to take critical actions. When the history books are written, they will estimate how many Americans will have been killed by the criminal negligence of Donald Trump. It will be greater than 60,000 people."

Think about how many times as a kid you or a friend tried to stay home from school bullshitting some fake illness you didn't have? That's the real problem. You cannot run a society with the standard of ""oh you have a runny nose? Don't come in"" because even as logical as it sounds people would abuse the fuck out of it. There is just no way around it. And it has worked decently enough to the point that society as a whole can function under the stupid ass system we have in place right now. But unfortunately it's a lot more complicated than if you're sick, stay home. Because for everyone sick and staying home, they'll be 3 people staying home because they didn't feel like going to work. And that even happens already. I just think cleanliness and personal hygiene needs to be reevaluated. And as shitty as it sounds, amassing crows of 1000+ people or whatever is an even bigger issue, because a lot of jobs will have limited exposure to civilians within the time frame a virus can infect someone (if everyone takes the right precautions)

A lot of the ways that chemo uses to attack a tumor don't even apply to what is a strong of genetic material inside a container.

Again, maybe a combination of masks and instructions works at lowering infection rates in asymptomatic non-healthcare workers, but the empirical backing isn't there yet. When there exists a collection of well-designed generalizable studies showing that, we can claim empirically that it works, but until then we can't. That's what I said at the start.

An American patient released from a Da Nang hospital Friday thanked doctors for saving his life and lauded Vietnams quarantining efforts.

Young Matthew Houston leaves Da Nang Hospital after recovering from Covid-19, April 3, 2020. Photo by VnExpress/Van Chung.

Matthew Houston, ""Patient 68,"" was discharged from the Da Nang Hospital after more than 20 days of treatment.

The 41-year-old had tested negative three times in a row.

""It’s so important that we patients are quarantined properly,"" Houston said on being discharged.

Referring to how drastic the Covid-19 situation has become in the U.S., he added: ""I’d like to thank Vietnam for saving me. The doctors and nurses are wonderful. They have saved my life.""

Houston is married to a Vietnamese woman and lives in Da Nang. He had been to eight countries before returning to Da Nang on March 14.

Since February 11, he had visited India, Spain, Morocco, Switzerland, Germany, Hungary and the Netherlands, then transited at Singapore before landing at the Da Nang International Airport on March 14 on Silkair flight MI632.

After he submitted a health declaration upon arrival at Da Nang International Airport, he was quarantined at the 199 Military Hospital. After his samples tested positive for the novel coronavirus he was admitted to the Da Nang Hospital for treatment.


Hospital director Le Duc Nhan said Houston was in stable health since he was admitted, and the process of helping him recover from the Covid-19 was smooth.

As regulated by the Health Ministry, Houston will be placed under medical monitoring for 14 days to prevent any possible transmission of the virus.

Houston is the fourth Covid-19 patient discharged from hospital in Da Nang and the 86th in Vietnam.

Da Nang now has two patients left and has recorded no new Covid-19 infection in the past eight days.

Vietnam now has 239 Covid-19 cases, including 153 active patients. Most of the active ones are those who have returned from Europe and the U.S. and people who’ve had close contact with them.

To date, the Covid-19 pandemic has killed more than 59,000 people as it spread to 205 countries and territories."

There were 3,736 Covid-19 suspects quarantined in Vietnamese hospitals as of Saturday morning, down 935 cases compared to Friday.


Those deemed Covid-19 suspects are people who’ve come into close contact with patients or have returned from outbreak areas, or those who’ve shown symptoms of cough, fever and shortness of breath.

Vietnam is still monitoring the health of more than 73,000 people who’d come into contact with infected patients or entered the country from outbreak hit areas, the highest level since Covid-19 crisis erupted late last year in China. Of these, more than 36,000 people are isolated at home since they have determinant factors but not associated symptoms and are yet to diagnosed as having the virus.

As of Saturday morning, the capital city of Hanoi has recorded 107 Covid-19 cases, 38 of whom are being treated at the National Hospital of Tropical Diseases. More than 21,000 people are being monitored.

More than 480 F1 (people having close contact with the patients) and 2,893 F2 (people having close contact with F1) cases have been isolated for health monitoring; and 360 people entering Vietnam from March 7 are still to meet the 14-day quarantine requirement.

Hospitals in Hanoi are quarantining and treating a total of 274 cases, 176 of them suspects with symptoms and epidemiological factors. Hospitals have received 620 rapid test kits from the citys Center for Disease Control to actively screen these patients.

Hanoi has been on high alert since the detection of ""Patient 237,"" a 64-year-old Swedish man with blood cancer who’s been in Vietnam since last December. Hed visited many places in northern Vietnam was only diagnosed with Covid-19 on Friday. As many as 89 medical workers from the four hospitals that he had visited are now in quarantine.

Saigon has recorded 50 positive cases so far and 19 of them have been cured. More than 7,000 people are in quarantine camps and more than 1,700 are quarantined at home. The city has strengthened the inspection and supervision of community quarantine facilities; as well as those quarantined at home. It has required medical facilities to send doctors to houses of patients quarantined at home and to exchange phone numbers with patients over 60 years old.

The central city of Da Nang has recorded six cases, of which four have been discharged. More than 600 people are being quarantined in a concentrated area and more than 1,400 people are quarantined in homes and other accommodation facilities.

The southern city of Can Tho has sent home 370 people after they completed their 14 day quarantine and have tested negative twice. It is expected that by Sunday, 272 more cases will be tested for the second time and would have completed their quarantine stint.

In Binh Thuan Province, seven of nine Covid-19 cases were discharged Friday and moved to other facilities for 14 days where their health will be monitored.

Other localities like Hai Phong City and the provinces of Quang Ninh, Bac Giang and Quang Nam have set up checkpoints, limiting entry and exit of people to reduce the risk of Covid-19 spreading among local communities.

In the past 24 hours, Vietnam has recorded six new cases, bringing the total number of Covid-19 patients to 239. Of these, 90 people have been discharged after successful treatment.

As of Saturday, 149 Covid-19 patients are being treated at 21 medical facilities, most of them in stable health. Five patients are reportedly in serious condition and receiving intensive treatment.

The Covid-19 pandemic has claimed more than 59,000 lives as it spread to 205 countries and territories."

There is a pesticide they are using called organophosphate that are effecting bats. It's used in china and the US. I need to research ""white nose syndrome"" in bats next, but apparently like 8,000 of them were dying in NY. High phosphate levels in humans has been linked to a 48 white male he experienced ""fever chills, and a productive cough"". I'm still working. There is a small link between children with similar symptoms with boca who experience high fever and cough. Boca is a parvovirus. and parvo in bats has been found in Hong Kong and mainland China. They also found boca virus in the bats. Covid has been known to cause hemorrhaging and edema in lungs which also happened to a cat in Zhengzhu zoo 5 hours away from Wuhan China. The cat had Parvovirus. Apparently, and I don't know what this means, but parvovirus display a capacity unknown in DNA genomes. And show ""high genetic heterogeneity and large population sizes resembling the quasispecies found in RNA viruses"" Covid 19 is an RNA virus. ""Chinese bats, specifically, horseshoe bats.

You have the worst health care system in the developed world and a poorly developed welfare system. And it's been like that for a long time. Maybe trump is incompetent and someone else would have done better. But there is only so much you can do when the system itself is broken. Americans need to think more deeply about how their society is organized.

There are many countries that are a byproduct of these atrocities, but most countries do not start a war or start colonizing and enslaving other areas of the world. Yes, certain countries may align with a certain power during a war, but the United States is known for it's war regime. There are countries, such as Sweden and Switzerland, that has not fought in a war since the 1800s and before. These are also countries that have not colonized other countries or have a history of slavery. Countries such as Singapore, New Zealand, and Bhutan have also participated in very few wars within their history. According to Visionofhumanity.org the United States is ranked number 128 on the global peace index.

A double-layer mask with a simple cotton outer layer and an inner layer of flannel also performed well, he said.

From denial of the existence of the virus, not closing the borders, lock down orders not being implemented, not wearing mask to telling people everyone should be wearing them. Daft. Maybe people making decisions should watch those documentaries and would understand how irresponsible they are?

PS: I came back from Italy about a 2 weeks before they start shutting down. Started slowly stocking up (I do grocery shopping once a week anyway) and wearing PPE in public. I do it every time I need to go outside people still give me crazy looks. Out of 50 people I see maybe 3 wear masks."

I resent the food hoarders because in my financial situation I literally can not imagine a lifestyle where I have enough room in my apartment for that much food, much less my fridge. I'm trying really hard to limit any and all time outside, and having to visit every grocery store within a 10 mile radius just to find essentials is not aiding in that cause.

What is your interpretation for the correlation between universal mask wearing and low infection / mortality rates in Hong Kong, Taiwan, and Japan?

Being located right next to Mainland China, they all had huge traffic between the mainland, and they also had the first COVID-19 case as early as January (much earlier than US and Europe), but they have much less cases so far compared to US and Europe. Why? As soon as they became aware of the situation in Wuhan, EACH OF THEM TOOK DIFFERENT APPROACH,  BUT WHAT THEY DID IN COMMON WAS TO IMMEDIATELY RECOMMEND UNIVERSAL MASK WEARING. 

The result at this moment: (Total cases / Million Population)

US: 816, Hong Kong: 113, Japan: 21, Taiwan: 15

The result at this moment: (Death / Million Population)

USA: 21, Hong Kong: 0.5, Japan: 0.5, Taiwan:0.2

If you compare the biggest city in each countries, NY, Hong Kong, Taipei, Tokyo, the gap will be even bigger. 

Also, both Japan and Hong Kong have the 1st and 2nd highest life expectancy in the world (84 years in average), meaning that they have highest ratio of old population that are vulnerable to COVID-19, but their hospital are not overwhelmed yet at this moment. 

Correlation does not necessarily imply causation, but considering that they took quite different approaches other than ""universal mask wearing"", I don't think dismissing the correlation as a mere ""intuition"" is what a proper scientist would do.

What's your thought?"

Here’s the important scary part : without going onto life support machines like ventilators, the death rate in all age categories approaches the hospitalization rate. And hospitalization rates for all age groups are much closer.

Trump is the person that has fired experts in this field. Trump is person that fired people in this field because “he doesn’t like paying people who aren’t doing something now.”

Trump is the person who has pretended for weeks that it is not an issue. Public statements mean something. People listen to them. Even if you don’t, others do. The sense of “it’s not a problem, it will go away” comes straight from the top. These are literally his words for weeks and weeks even as Europe started to get out of control.

Trump is the person who distrusts experts. Trump is the person who considers himself an expert in everything even though he’s demonstrably a fucking moron probably suffering from the early stages of dementia.

Trump is a LEADER. What a leader says COUNTS. What a leader does COUNTS. Even if people don’t respect him, his actions, his decisions, his communication, all reflect on how the nation responds to a crisis.

It is absolutely evident that Trump dropped the ball on this a long time ago. Trumps failure to prepare America for this can only be described as criminal. What is unfolding in America is catastrophic and could have been prevented. There is no shortage of experts who have been jumping up and down about this for months. It just takes a proper leader to listen to them.

Trump has a huge amount of culpability for what is unfolding. He is the leader. The buck stops with the leader. Either he isn’t a leader, or he’s a really shitty leader. Given he seems to believe he’s a “leader” then the only explanation is number two. He’s a fucking awful leader. A fucking awful person too, but we all knew that even before he was elected, let’s face it.

America - you are now reaping what you sowed.

All electrical measurements, like current, voltage, resistance, power have an element of inaccuracy due to the essential interference (with the circuit) required to perform the act of measuring. It's just the meter's measuring interference is tiny like 0.01% etc, so the inaccuracy is good enough.
In this case, awareness and/or acting basedon that awareness, does cause a significant change in the outcomes, so publishing the model will cause it to alter the outcomes, but only if the model is acted upon. If it is not spread widely or not acted upon, the outcomes will be just like if there was no model.

I personally think France is accusing other countries of doing something criminal when out government is doing much worse.

And there is a lot of disinformation.

For instance, we still hear that the US has stolen pour masks when it seems that in reality they have paid for it.

But the media are using a very accusatory tone when talking about other countries. When it's about France, you hear less about it and the vocabulary is softer (we don't steal, we requisition).

This is an example of a softer article about the Czech Republic (because it's relatively new):
https://www.lefigaro.fr/international/la-republique-tcheque-a-soustrait-680-000-masques-et-respirateurs-destines-a-l-italie-20200322

The first news about it claimed the Czech Republic had stolen masks and other materials and sometimes claimed some of them belong to France.

There is a lot of disinformation about that case. 

Actual.information Can ne found hère: https://blogs.mediapart.fr/emmanuel-boussuge-et-bertrand-schmitt/blog/030420/gestion-tcheque-de-la-crise-sanitaire-et-vol-de-masques?utm_source=twitter&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=Sharing&xtor=CS3-67

And the masks were sent to Italy in the end. 

But don't worry, the media can still complain about the US now. It's becoming hard to find reliable sources and rumours are spreading very fast.

Si far the communication about this crisis has been full of hypocrisy in France. It's an absolute mess. The government doesn't want to be held responsible. I hope there will be penaltie because I see people complaining about their country not doing the right things and I feel like mine is definitely among the worse as well."

People are almost as productive working from home, and that is amazing considering they do kindergarten/school from home at the same time. Not all production has stopped - it has slowed a little because of staggered shifts and more distance between people. It is the service-area that is hurting the most - noone is going out to eat or drink, noone is getting their hair done. But - do those contribute a lot to a country's ecconomy? Or do they simply keep the money sirculating? They are not selling anything to abroad.

Schools were closed and there were no public gatherings. We came up with the term ‘protective sequestration’, where a defined and healthy group of people are shielded from the risk of infection from outsiders.”

The people of Gunnison managed this by erecting guarded barricades on the main highways in and out of the surrounding county. Railway passengers were forced to submit to two days of quarantine upon arrival.

The sanatorium and school for the blind benefited from being relatively closed communities already, with walls to confine those who lived there also helping to protect those inside from the disease running rampant through the communities on the outside.

Being hard to reach also helped to protect other communities in 1918. The US naval base on the island of Yerba Buena, in San Francisco Bay, was only accessibly by boat. The base’s 6,000 residents were confined to the island and no visitors were allowed ashore. The few arrivals allowed on the island were confined to quarantine, were given three times daily throat sprays, and had to maintain a distance of 20 feet from one another.
For severe pandemics it might be cost beneficial for some islands to close their borders
When these measures were lifted in November 1918, as reports of cases in San Francisco were on the decline, the base experienced only mild cases, but at least three people did die.

“The moment you open up the gates, the virus enters in the bodies of people who come in,” says Markel. “Protective sequestration is only as good as long as you are doing it.

“The notion that you can shut down a modern city or even a university today is not very likely though. It is extremely expensive and disruptive.”

But there may be some benefit to keeping the virus out for as long as is possible. American Samoa implemented a five-day quarantine for all boats that kept influenza from its shores until 1920. When it finally did arrive, the virus appears to have lost much of its sting and there were no deaths attributed to influenza in a population of more than 8,000. The main island of Samoa to the northwest, however, lost around a fifth of its population to the pandemic."

A quote from the paper: ""The study design does not allow us to determine whether medical masks had efficacy or whether cloth masks were detrimental to HCWs by causing an increase in infection risk. Either possibility, or a combination of both effects, could explain our results. It is also unknown whether the rates of infection observed in the cloth mask arm are the same or higher than in HCWs who do not wear a mask, as almost all participants in the control arm used a mask.""

Some evidence that masks in general work:
https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16014825
https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3266257/?report=reader
https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2662657/?report=reader
https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3810906/

Second, evidence that cloth masks are at least somewhat effective:
https://www.cambridge.org/core/services/aop-cambridge-core/content/view/0921A05A69A9419C862FA2F35F819D55/S1935789313000438a.pdf/testing_the_efficacy_of_homemade_masks_would_they_protect_in_an_influenza_pandemic.pdf

The truth is there is evidence that cloth masks are useful in preventing the wearer from getting infected. That evidence is not strong but there hasn't been much research in the area. Common sense, scientific studies (albiet relatively weak ones), and a bunch of youtube videos which show where droplets end up strongly suggest cloth masks help the wearer and those around them avoid infection. It would be great if we knew better, but you work with what you have."

So far we haven't seen much evidence of the federal government doing anything of value in handling this current crisis. 

According to the article, ""at least initially the key mission of [the] team remained a priority.""

**""...at least initially...""** 

And then it stopped being one. And no one's in charge of the team, apparently.

The truth is, Trump went into the White House with a group of people determined to *dismantle the federal government.* 

Right now there's no one in charge of *anything* at the White House, other than Trump bungling up left, right and center with his enormous ego-stroking needs, and his staff is, as always, just running around behind him trying to clean up the IMPOTUS' fricking *public image* and leaving chaos everywhere.

But they forgot something very important, which is that the government is there to defend the people of the country against it's attackers--including the business sector. And including pandemics. They're failing miserably.

It's really sad to see that the state governors and mayors of cities and towns are desperately trying to ""manage up"" with the federal government, but right now *no one is in charge*--except the man who spent his entire business career bankrupting one company after another, both his own and others who made the mistake of doing business with him. The man who was propped up to the tune of his fathers $400 million fortune, which he used up by the early 2000's. 

This is a man who turned to laundering Russian money through his real estate holdings in order to be able, as Eric and Don Jr. so kindly explained to us, to pay cash since no reputable bank would do business with them any more.

Sorry for the rant at the end, but this is infuriating. There used to be a functioning pandemic response team that was dismantled under the guise of 'consolidation' that left our country vulnerable. There's an incompetent leader in the White House whose sole concern is his own ego and income. 

I'm sure we'll muddle through this but the response and outcome *could have been* so much better than it has."

Countries in the west are at 10,000 tests per million. Pakistan is double the tests per million of india. Choose your benchmark.

Its not even general disobedience or even ignorance just how do you stay at home indoors, when your home is a tiny 9m^(2) (roughly 100 ft^(2) , sometimes smaller) tin shack that you share with 6+ people that in the sun can bake to 50C (122 F) and then you have multiple shacks piled on top of one another too. Not to mention on a bi weekly basis a lot of these people need to collect a social grant of some sort to survive and you have mass movement and groupings of people at pay points (even though govt is enforcing social distancing here). Our case growth at the moment is low but thats baked in and has been a function of reactive testing from quite stellar contact tracing.  


The real numbers are like most places are gonna pop up in 2 weeks, this is due to all the panic buying that occurred before the lockdown as well as the most recent social grant payouts (which led to more shoppers in informal settlements who now needed to buy food) not top mention the govt didnt ban regional travel before the lockdown so lots of people migrated from the informal settlements in the cities to their rural homes to spend the lockdown with their larger families. The only hope of SA beating it is for the govts mass community testing/screening program thats kicking off on monday to pay off to identify new community clusters (especially in informal settlements) and withdraw those people to quarantine sites  to stop the spread."
