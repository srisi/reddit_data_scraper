2020-02-15,ne0ndistraction,Coronavirus,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/f4ho0n/cruise_ship_passengers_pissed_about_2week/fhqql1f/," YOKOHAMA, Japan — American passengers under coronavirus lockdown on the Diamond Princess cruise ship in Yokohama were told Saturday of U.S. plans to take them home. But some were outraged by the new rules: 14 additional days of quarantine back in the United States.

""It's completely devastating,"" said Karey Sells, 44, from St. George, Utah. ""If they wanted to keep us under quarantine for an additional period, they should have picked us up 10 days ago. They should have done their job.""

The announcement was a shift from previous U.S. statements that the passengers were best serving out their quarantine aboard the ship, and that passengers would not have to do more once they returned home.

The Japanese government also announced that an additional 67 people on the ship were found to have the virus, out of the latest batch of 217 who were tested, although more than half showed no symptoms. That brings to 285 the number of passengers and crew members who have been found to be infected out of 930 tested, more than 30 percent.

Sells, who is self-employed, said the forced absence would harm her business. She thinks people testing positive for the virus probably contracted it before the quarantine period began, but says the U.S. government should have sent experts at the start to assess whether the quarantine on the ship was effective.

“They should have done this on the very first day,” she said, close to tears. “And now 400 American citizens are going to suffer because of their incompetence.”

Sells doesn’t even know whether her husband, a Canadian citizen who owns a small business in the United States, will be able to travel with her.

“That’s basically a month of our lives we are being held captive,” she added. “And without just cause — we didn’t commit a crime.”

**New cases on the ship**

The ship, with 2,666 passengers and 1,045 crew members, began a 14-day quarantine on Feb. 5. The end was supposed to come on Wednesday, and passengers anticipated being able to return home. But as more tests were carried out, it became clear that a high percentage of people had the virus, and experts warned that there was a risk it could still be spreading on the ship.

In acknowledgment of those risks, [Japan changed course](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/asia_pacific/japan-relaxes-cruise-ship-quarantine-for-elderly-amid-fears-of-virus-spread/2020/02/13/4e0e2470-4e43-11ea-967b-e074d302c7d4_story.html?tid=lk_inline_manual_19&itid=lk_inline_manual_19) and began evacuating some passengers before the quarantine period ended, beginning with people older than 80 and with underlying health problems. It also stepped up its program of testing passengers.

After initially backing Japan’s approach toward the ship, the U.S. government has now also implicitly acknowledged that the Diamond Princess may not have been the best place to keep the American travelers.

“We are deeply grateful to the cruise line and government of Japan for working diligently to contain and control the spread of the illness,” the U.S. Embassy in Tokyo wrote in an email to Americans on the ship.

“However, to fulfill our government’s responsibilities to U.S. citizens under our rules and practices, as well as to reduce the burden on the Japanese health care system, the U.S. government recommends, out of an abundance of caution, that U.S. citizens disembark and return to the United States for further monitoring.”

It was a decision that some passengers said should have been made much earlier.

“Why didn’t they test everybody \[earlier\] and it would have been over?” asked Melanie Haering, 58, of Tooele, Utah, echoing a question many people have asked from the beginning.

**'Frightening'**

Medical experts have expressed concerns that the virus could still be spreading on the ship, possibly through the crew, or even perhaps through the air conditioning system — although the captain has repeatedly assured passengers that the air in their cabins is fresh rather than recycled. More than 20 crew members have tested positive for the virus.

The email said the State Department, working with the Department of Health and Human Services and other agencies, will provide a chartered aircraft to passengers directly from Japan to Travis Air Force Base in California, and for some passengers on to Lackland Air Force Base in Texas.

The plane will arrive in Japan on Sunday evening. Passengers will be screened for symptoms and then taken by bus to the plane. “We are working with our Japanese partners to ensure that any symptomatic passengers receive the required care in Japan if they cannot board the flight,” the embassy said.

“Travelers returning to the United States from high-risk areas are required to undergo quarantine. Accordingly, you will need to undergo further quarantine of 14 days when you arrive in the United States,” the email said.

“We understand this is frustrating and an adjustment, but these measures are consistent with the careful policies we have instituted to limit the potential spread of the disease.”

Passengers who choose not to return on this flight will be unable to return to the United States “for a period of time,” the embassy wrote.

Several passengers said they viewed the additional quarantine period as the wisest course of action but still found the news tough to process.

“Having hoped that three, four days from now, I’d be getting on a plane and this would be all behind me, now facing another 14-day quarantine on a military institution where the conditions — I imagine they’re obviously going to be more sanitary, but they’re going to be vastly different — it is frightening,” said Spencer Fehrenbacher, 29, a U.S. citizen whose family immigrated to Canada in 2016."

They are very aware of the situation, and very capable of putting hundreds of patients on ventilators if the need should arise (at least the hospitals here in Southern California are). They are able to create quarantine areas quickly should the need arise, and many around here already have plans they are beginning to put into action. Our medical system is able to cope with an initial influx of infections much better than the Chinese hospitals could with their lack of resources and greater population density. They won't be able to handle it forever if it rages out of control, but if we can slow the spread through social distancing and proper hygiene, we SHOULD be able to handle the first large waves of patients without being completely overwhelmed like in China (assuming it even gets a foothold here).

If Chinese students don’t like it, I’m sure there is plenty other places they can go. Chinese would ban Australians from entering China in exactly the same manner if there had been a novel flu outbreak here and hundreds of thousands of Aussies went to China for Uni. 

It seems we’re always the ones having to be dictated to by Chinese financial interests. 

Screw that. Educate people to better our nation and don’t turn education into just another economic cash cow

Walk away then Chinese students. Our universities survived without you in the past. It should never be a dynamic of us NEEDING you and becoming a transactional power play. Nothing against Chinese students coming here to study, but just as in China, we play by YOUR rules, in Australia, accept that you play by ours.

We are sovereign, and allowing the influence of Chinese money to influence our decisions will lead us down the path of being dependent on Chinese money to flourish, which we are close to being anyway.

«There is no such thing, at this date of the world's history, in America, as an independent press. You know it and I know it.

There is not one of you who dares to write your honest opinions, and if you did, you know beforehand that it would never appear in print. I am paid weekly for keeping my honest opinion out of the paper I am connected with. Others of you are paid similar salaries for similar things, and any of you who would be so foolish as to write honest opinions would be out on the streets looking for another job. If I allowed my honest opinions to appear in one issue of my paper, before twenty-four hours my occupation would be gone.

The business of the journalists is to destroy the truth, to lie outright, to pervert, to vilify, to fawn at the feet of mammon, and to sell his country and his race for his daily bread. You know it and I know it, and what folly is this toasting an independent press?

We are the tools and vassals of rich men behind the scenes. We are the jumping jacks, they pull the strings and we dance. Our talents, our possibilities and our lives are all the property of other men. We are intellectual prostitutes.»

If you have the ability to garden, haven't done it before, and are expecting to rely on it as a food source, check out your local resources and set your expectations for what you can grow, how to grow it, and when it will produce. Try a lot of different things, in case one particular crop fails.

Also set expectations of how much you can provide. If you think a 10'x10' garden patch can feed your entire family . . . yeah, no. It can produce a lot and be an invaluable supplement to your diet, but you're not going to be living off the land.

Realize that you'll need a water source, so if you're hardcore prepping, you'll need to secure a way to provide them with water if your system goes down.

Different vegetables have their seasons. Grow some calorie crops (i.e. potatoes, corn) too. You can't feed yourself entirely off lettuce. Also think of ways to preserve the produce. One month you may find yourself overwhelmed with tomatoes and zucchinni, and then the next month, your season is over.

Lots of complexities to consider here, but I'd recommend it. Gardening can be very relaxing and provide you with a bit of zen in a world gone crazy."

There have been a couple hospital wide emails re. fit testing for n95 masks for all clinical staff as well as plans made for outpatient and emergency areas to identify high risk individuals. The hospital suspended business/research travel to and from China before the lockdown. Managers have indeed locked up n95 masks and stated “these are on national back order and people are going around to different departments and taking them home”. That’s about it. My co workers don’t seem to know much about the virus. Every time I mention it the response is “It’s just the flu, right?”. I think the general plan is “wait and see, hope it never gets here”

I’m very concerned because tertiary care hospitals in the us never have empty beds or extra staff. We only have a few negative airflow rooms. Patients wait for days in the er or community hospitals to be admitted to an ICU here. The hospital has probably 100 ICU beds. At any time we are 90-110 percent full, with ICU patients boarding in the ER or PACU. The American healthcare system has nowhere near the capacity to deal with a crisis this size. The sick people filling our hospitals already will still be there. We also don’t have an army of healthcare workers to draw on. We have just enough doctors and nurses to run the hospitals and to be honest, these nurses are going to stay home and take care of their sick families, not put their health on the line for the public.

    I work in a trauma hospital in a major California city. I can tell you they are quietly preparing an ICU wing for CoVid 19. They are fitting certain frontline healthcare workers with N95’s; but sadly you only get 1 mask. This hospital can’t get enough to supply at this point, to allow us to trash each mask after use. Let that sink in a moment. Many people just don’t grasp how undersupplied all the hospitals are to protect workers; which in turn protects other patients. And those of us who have been paying attention already know that N95 is really not very effective anyway- health care workers should be in Paprs. Our hospital is already at a “critically overcrowded” state. Just imagine what an epicenter here would do. There are not enough resources or personnel to deal with the scale of this. The way I see it we have 4-5 epicenters officially going right now, with Whuhan, Japan, Hong Kong, cruise ship, and Singapore. There will be more. I know that is painful for those with cognitive dissonance. But please don’t’ just push it away out of fear or discomfort. There are things you can do!
   In terms of staying in and taking extra precautions, yes really we all should do to the fullest extent that we can social distance. It is a completely  foreign concept to our American way of life- but hey, couldn’t the “ American Way of Life” use some evolving???
    For our precautions at home we mask up for shopping or have it delivered. We exercise in the house- yes boo, but better than nothing. When we get home from work at the hospital we strip our clothes and shoes at the door in a garbage bag, sanitize our hands, and go right to the shower with hiebeclenz. This virus travels by air and fomites, so we try not to bring the fomites in. Is this overkill? Perhaps, but remember when you start hearing about a lot of cases in your community-you have already been exposed and exposed others. Be brave and dare to do the different thing! Often times, the brave are rewarded!"

That is also the reason why bats are great hosts for these viruses to multiply and mutate.

Aerosol transmission generally refers to aerosol droplets generated by a cough or sneeze. Being heavier, they generally settle to the ground in minutes.

Most respiratory viruses are transmitted by aerosols. (coughs and sneezes)  In such a mode of transmission, the newly infected are assumed to have had to been in close proximity to the transmitter.

If this virus is transmissible by an airborne route, then the newly infected patient never needs to be in close proximity to the transmitter, and in fact may randomnly inhale the virus during routine activity when no one else is around.

The Chinese have come to believe that airborne transmission is a problem, and have taken to fogging all major cities with aerosol disinfectant daily, in order to accumulate suspended viral particles on droplets and cause them to settle.

Whether the Chinese are correct or not is uncertain. However, the fogging is a costly nuisance, and one would presume the Chinese have confirmed airborne transmission. Probably by air sampling.

I should note that airborne transmission could explain another peculiar fact of this epidemic. That being, unusually long incubation times.

If the virus is acquired by aerosol, the viral load inhaled is presumably higher, and would result in a relatively short incubation time, so the patient would show symptoms quicker.

If the virus is acquired by airborne transmission, the viral load inhaled may be only one or two particles. This would create the opportunity to very long incubation times, and patients might remain asymptomatic for weeks.

This may also have some bearing on the complaints about the sensitivity of testing."

Drop the booze if you were chronically drinking it like I was until Tuesday. Chronic alcohol use increases the inflammatory response which would in theory increase the response to lung infection by causing pneumonia. Oddly enough, acute alcohol use decreases the inflammatory response but you shouldn't be drinking if you're really sick anyhow. 

Drop smoking. Even the mary-jane. Get the gum, patch, whatever. Do it now and give your lungs time to heal.

Fresh fruits and veggies with dinner.  Lots of variety.

Get a full night's sleep if you can. This one is most important. Underslept people suffer more bugs seasonally.

Drop as much processed food as possible. Sucrose (sugar) enhances inflammation which you want to reduce. The liver has to process sucrose for you whereas glucose is simply absorbed. I know it's delicious.

Get a bit of cardio but not enough to stress your system so that you get sick, obviously. Take the stairs instead of the elevator. Walk to the grocery store. Don't bother getting a gym membership because those places are always lousy with whatever cold bug is going around.

Do breathing exercises to bolster your lung function: (like a COPD patient would)

Purse your lips like duckface and breathe slowly through them .. the resistance will help you work your diaphragm. Do this when you can and when it doesn't look ridiculous.

Pushups are good for chest muscles.

Just live clean for a while. I know id rather be drunk off my ass right now with all of the uncertainty. I fucking love that warm blanket of a good drinking session. But I was doing it nightly. 

Giving myself a little edge to keep me out of the hospital is more important than feeling awesome and drunk. In 42. Young enough to not likely need hospitalization but old enough I won't just bounce back like a 20 year old.

Most importantly, spend time with friends and family now, enjoy events with crowds NOW because if it hits us in North America hard, say goodbye to going to the bar, restaurant, or movie theater for like a year.

If you have any elderly relatives, spend time with them. Enjoy their company now. Pneumonia is very very hard on the elderly. And if they have to be isolated in the hospital or put on a vent or are in a field hospital for palliative care, you can't visit them."

""in first world countries the coronavirus is no more a threat than the flu.""

Pandemic flu is not seasonal flu. Many studies show huge risk to first-world countries from pandemic flu-like illnesses because healthcare system is not sized to cope with large fraction of population getting sick all at once.

""The Medicare in first world countries is much better than in China""

Chinese life expectancy is 76 years, basically same as US. Have you been to China? The big cities have very modern healthcare with outcomes now comparable to western systems.

""in a crowded city where they eat all sorts of wild animals."" 

Plenty of crowded cities. Food source not relevant to propagation of disease.

""the reason that China’s medical workers are getting sick is because they don’t have enough gear to prevent virus from spreading.""

That doesn't explain the Japanese medical workers getting sick despite having full gear.

""The economy is more important than this""

The people of Wuhan clearly feel otherwise.  You may too, when it comes to your city.

""let the places like CDC and WHO ... handle this- instead of mass hysteria...""

There's a lot of room between ""let someone else handle this"" and ""mass hysteria"".  Better to put accurate info out, so people are not caught mentally unprepared when the global war against the virus comes to their own neighborhood. The real mass hysteria comes when people have been told ""don't worry"" and then reality arrives. Getting people thinking and talking about global problems will stimulate better ideas and more positive actions."

So genuine question: how would the number coming out of Hubei NOT slow down given the measures they have taken to stop the spread of the virus?

Whether the numbers are totally accurate doesn't matter. But logically the idea that the numbers are going to slow down makes sense. There's no reason to believe that China would have been comfortable reporting 15k new cases 2 days ago and then intentionally under report the numbers today, which would also make the death rate look much worse."

This causes the patient to cough up phlegm and a spray of water. This is why the hospital staff were getting infected. They had to start wearing face shields so the contaminated spray could not enter their eyes. I imagine if someone did cough on someone like that there would be many more virus particles than in airosol as happened with the Japanese taxi driver who became infected by carrying a sick person. (he is fine but his 80yr old mother in law died) I wonder if having lots of virus particles at once entering the body might be the reason that reasonably young drs like Dr Li would die. This Cat Scan diagnosis is fast and accurate but the patient has to be pretty far down the sick path to be able to diagnose.

""The nation is battling [the coronavirus outbreak](https://www.nytimes.com/article/what-is-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&module=styln-coronavirus&variant=show&region=TOP_BANNER&context=storyline_menu) with a grass-roots mobilization reminiscent of Mao-style mass crusades not seen in China in decades, essentially entrusting front line epidemic prevention to a supercharged version of a neighborhood watch.""

""Residential lockdowns of varying strictness — from checkpoints at building entrances to hard limits on going outdoors — now cover at least 760 million people in China, or more than half the country’s population, according to a New York Times analysis of government announcements in provinces and major cities. Many of these people live far from the city of Wuhan, where the virus was first reported and which the government [sealed off last month](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/23/world/asia/china-coronavirus-outbreak.html).

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electricity\_generation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electricity_generation)   China is very similar to the US.  The majority of power is generated from coal/natural gas which is mined every day and the reserves are very limited.  

If you have pneumonia, you are not mining coal and gas.  If the power goes out, the water treatment plants will not function.  How well will your grocery store be able to stay in business without electricity?  Paper and coin money only?  No phones?  No internet?  How do they order more supplies?  Write a letter?  LoL  

Right now, you only really need some food to keep yourself from having to go to the store and risk getting infected.  You will probably not need a gun.  If the Chinese experience power outage, water shortage, and food shortage, the clock starts ticking in the rest of the world.  What would your situation be like if you had no running water and no grocery store to buy some from?  You would probably need guns, ammo, living arrangements near a source of water with the ability to filter/disinfect it.

And yet Singapore and several other countries are reporting new cases with no clear links to past cases.

The  concept of testing for coronavirus whenever the flu test is negative makes sense and should be expanded nationwide immediately.  

Number one priority is to give people adequate information so they can make informed choices to limit exposure, and without adequate surveillance that's impossible. CDC needs to put more resources into getting ample supplies of coronavirus tests kits into every primary care clinic that currently tests for flu.

As a result, most British people know that accident and emergency rooms and hospitals are being stretched to breaking point as it is. Seasonal flu pushes the NHS to breaking point - it's called the ""winter crisis."" An epidemic that requires 100x the number of hospitalisations of seasonal flu? 

There is no cure, there is no vaccine that is available in wealthy countries that isn't available in China. China is the second wealthiest economy on the face of the planet.  

96% of NHS workers recently surveyed said they felt unprepared for this.  
In the US I hear it can cost $40 just to get them to read your oxygen levels with a device that costs less than that to buy. 

Imagine your local ER. A hundred, two hundred people turn up with pneumonia. Are you convinced that the healthcare system can handle that no problems?

I was falling behind in other things.  If it helps, see if your community has a social media site (Facebook, Next-door, etc), and join it.  Then once a day, usually at night, do a quick check-in.  If all the posts are about normal things (lost pets, people not picking up their dog's poop, etc), then you're good.  Because if something were happening in my community, I guarantee it would be posted there.  Some of the people in those groups have nothing better to do than to watch their neighbors, their government officials, total strangers, etc, and complain about it.  If someone were coughing too much in the local market, someone would post about it on those groups.  It could just be someone with COPD or asthma, but they'd still gripe about it.  Hang in there and just try to prep as much as you can."

Most Singaporeans speak primarily in English with each other— all Singaporeans today are fluent in English, something that the mainland Chinese is not. Even when speaking in Chinese, the dialect is so vastly different from mainland mandarin that communicating in Chinese would be the equivalent of a white American trying to have a conversation with any foreigner in broken English.  There is a huge difference between Singaporean culture and China-Chinese culture, and the mainlanders that have immigrated to Singapore frequently face the same level of ostracism and discrimination as any racial minority might have when immigrating to North America, for example. I would even argue that the level of discrimination towards mainlanders is more prominent in Singapore than in a large metropolitan North American city, seeing as how racism in Singapore is a lot more covert given the obvious fact that they are discriminating against people of the same skin color as themselves. 

The majority of Singaporean cuisine (the majority of this being street food as it’s the most widely consumed) don’t resemble traditional Chinese cuisine any more than it resembles Malaysian cuisine. China-Chinese restaurants in Singapore taking a hit after the eruption of the coronavirus is effectively identical to Chinese restaurants losing business in NYC—SG people avoiding businesses run by mainlanders is identical to white people avoiding Chinese run businesses. They are not being “racist towards themselves” simply because they don’t view mainlanders as one of their own, given the absence of any significant cultural common denominator. To sum up, without commenting on whether the practice of avoiding Chinese restaurants at this time is in itself racist, just wanted to bring to light that SG Chinese are definitely racist towards mainlanders."

I hate to say how many years it has been since I took economics and so much has changed. It would be interesting if you did an AMA. I live in a landlocked city so I understand what can happen when just a few things do not go right with moving shipments in. I study how shipments come into my city, because of my husband's business. Amazon taking over routes is very tough. My husband is a repairman and orders parts  from the next city over and amazon has some priority? on shipping and now a part from the a city an hour away can take 3 days priority and all next day shipping services are not an option anymore. A few weeks ago there is a problem getting produce here, and grocery stores just had signs produce shortage and near bare shelves. That was scary and it was just a few days. Pharmacies have trouble on regular days getting meds moved to our city when they run out. I had a horrible time getting my son's seizure meds, I would go from pharmacy to pharmacy almost in tears some months and they were suppose to be auto-order but when they run out in another city, they do not make it to mine.  I see people place ads saying is anyone going to a bigger city and willing to pick up my kids medication and offering to pay good money because there are no options but to drive 200-300 miles each way to get medications. 
I worry as much about getting sick (I have genetic condition) as I do about lack of good in my landlocked city. I live in Southern Utah, booming area but so dependent on very limited ways of getting items in and we are kind of the end of the line for shipping it seems. I think Vegas would be a nightmare too. It is just a bigger landlocked version of my city.
