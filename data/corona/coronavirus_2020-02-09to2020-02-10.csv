One should expect the official numbers to start looking sub-exponential given the lack of capacity.

Coronavirus has killed a significant number of people in China for a couple of reasons.


First off, most of the individuals who have died are elderly, children, or people who were already immunocompromised. The odds of a healthy person succumbing are lower.


Second, public health is still extremely spotty in China. This whole coronavirus thing originated from infected meat from an open air market in Wuhan, where sanitation is more of a polite suggestion.


Third, you have the Communist Party's reaction. First reports of the virus were ignored because they ""disturbed the social order"", as we saw with Li Wenliang's arrest and subsequent death. Their government could have been ahead of this if their head wasn't firmly up their ass.


This situation is far less likely to arise in Western countries. Health care protocols have been improved as a result of SARS. And the risk of transmission is much more localized, mainly to ports of entry that see heavy traffic from Asia. Unless you work in Arrivals at Vancouver International Airport or something, you probably aren't going to get infected."

By Reed Abelson and Katie Thomas
Feb. 7, 2020


Resources are already stretched during flu season. With so much medical equipment and drugs made in China, public health experts are anxiously watching the global supply chain.

Hospitals are currently making preparations for a possible outbreak of  the new coronavirus.

With an intense flu season in full swing, hundreds of thousands of coughing and feverish patients have already overwhelmed emergency rooms around the United States. Now, hospitals are bracing for the potential spread of coronavirus that could bring another surge of patients.

So far, only a dozen people in the United States have become infected with the novel coronavirus, but an outbreak could severely strain the nation‚Äôs hospitals.

‚ÄúWe‚Äôre talking about the possibility of a double flu pandemic,‚Äù where a second wave starts before the first is over, said Dr. Eric Toner, a senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security.

Public health experts are also closely watching reserves of vital medical supplies and medications, many of which are made in China. Some hospitals in the United States are already ‚Äúcritically low‚Äù on respirator masks, according to Premier Inc., which secures medical supplies and equipment on behalf of hospitals and health systems. And China is the dominant supplier of the raw ingredients needed for penicillin, ibuprofen and even aspirin ‚Äî drugs taken daily by millions of Americans and dispensed routinely to hospital patients.

‚ÄúAll the hospitals are taxed with a large flu season and other bugs,‚Äù said Dr. Mark Jarrett, the chief quality officer for Northwell Health, which operates 23 hospitals across Long Island and elsewhere in New York. About 400 patients are coming to its emergency rooms each day with flulike symptoms.

‚ÄúEverybody is at maximum capacity,‚Äù Dr. Jarrett said.

Northwell activated its emergency operations center earlier this month in response to concerns that the virus, now in epidemic proportions across China, could become a pandemic, similar to the hospital system‚Äôs reaction to the threat of swine flu in 2009 and Ebola in 2014.

Although the Trump administration declared a public health emergency for coronavirus late last week, Dr. Robert Redfield, the head of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, stressed on Friday at a news briefing that the risk for Americans was still low. Hundreds of people who returned to the United States from Wuhan have been quarantined at military bases, and others possibly exposed have been asked to self-quarantine or stay at home.

But Dr. Redfield also said that officials were beginning to actively discuss what other steps would have to be taken in the event that the new coronavirus spread in this country. Asked about emergency funding, Alex M. Azar II, the secretary for health and human services, said he did not believe agencies required additional funds right now.

Still, across the country, hospitals are taking steps to prepare for the potential threat.

Some are already scrambling to find sufficient supplies of medical face masks, especially so-called N95 respirators, which are more effective for preventing infection. Manufacturers are struggling to keep up with global demand and the desperate need for supplies in China.

The mask shortage highlights just how dependent the United States health care system is on goods from China. Premier was told last week that a Taiwanese factory it had a contract with was halting shipments to the United States. In addition, Chaun Powell, the group vice president of strategic supplier engagement for Premier, said masks that are made in China are being diverted for use there. As a result, ‚Äúthere‚Äôs not as much supply to ship,‚Äù he said.

Hospitals in the United States have also increased their requests, he said, adding that orders for respirator masks in the first five days of February had completely outstripped the demand for a typical month.

‚ÄúWe‚Äôre trying to get as many masks as we can, as is everybody else,‚Äù Dr. Jarrett of Northwell said.

On Friday, Dr. Stephen Hahn, commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration, said the agency was closely monitoring the supply chain from Chinese pharmaceutical and medical supply factories, but said the F.D.A. had received no reports of disruption so far.

Many of those factories closed during the Lunar New Year holidays and remained closed for additional days..

‚ÄúMany of us are holding our breath to see the downstream effect on pharmaceuticals and other medical supplies because of this outbreak in China,‚Äù said Dr. Paul Biddinger, who helps oversee emergency preparedness for Partners Healthcare, the Boston hospital group that includes Massachusetts General.

Feb. 5, 2020
Experts like Dr. Toner say supplies could easily become depleted, especially at smaller hospitals that tend to have less inventory of basic items like masks, gowns and gloves. Hospitals have long struggled with shortages of injectable medications and staples like saline. In 2017, Hurricane Maria knocked out power to several pharmaceutical factories in Puerto Rico, leading to a shortage of saline bags.

Hospitals will ‚Äúburn through their supplies very quickly if there are a lot of these patients,‚Äù Dr. Toner said.

Some hospital executives downplayed concerns. ‚ÄúThis is something we have a tremendous amount of experience with,‚Äù said Dr. Paul Stefanacci, the chief medical officer for acute care of Universal Health Services, a for-profit hospital chain. His company has increased its orders of supplies by 10 percent to handle any uptick in patients.

David Gillan, senior vice president of sourcing operations at Vizient, another purchasing group, described the supply chain as strained, and said he worries about too much ‚Äúanticipatory behavior,‚Äù such as hospitals ordering more than they need.

Public health officials are also watching whether the shutdown of manufacturing plants could lead to shortages in a wide variety of drugs containing active ingredients made in China. Some drug makers reported that their facilities had reopened this week. But even temporary delays in manufacturing ‚Äî or problems transporting materials ‚Äî could lead to problems, some experts said.

‚ÄúA number of companies are panicking, for sure,‚Äù said James Bruno, a consultant who advises small and midsize drug makers on manufacturing issues. ‚ÄúEspecially the smaller ones who don‚Äôt have the wherewithal to have backup suppliers.‚Äù

Allen Goldberg, a spokesman for the Association for Accessible Medicines, a generic industry trade group, said companies typically have several years‚Äô worth of supplies of ingredients and that there were ‚Äúredundancies built into the system.‚Äù

Rosemary Gibson, an expert on China‚Äôs drug supply who is a senior adviser at the Hastings Center, a nonpartisan bioethics research institute, said she had learned of companies having trouble getting shipments of their products. ‚ÄúIf there were exports from China that were no longer coming to the U.S., our hospitals and our health systems would cease to function within a couple of months,‚Äù said Ms. Gibson, who also wrote a book, ‚ÄúChina Rx,‚Äù about the American dependence on medicines from China.

The United States has already seen examples of how quickly a disruption in supply from China can lead to shortages. In 2018, widespread recalls of the blood pressure drug valsartan were traced to problems at a single Chinese factory that made the drug‚Äôs active ingredient, which was contaminated with a possible carcinogen.

In 2016, a chemical explosion at a raw ingredient factory in China led to a global shortage of piperacillin-tazobactam, an antibiotic used to treat a number of life-or-death conditions, including sepsis.

About 20 F.D.A. employees assigned to the agency‚Äôs offices in China, and who were responsible for product inspections there, have been evacuated.

‚ÄúIt will be some matter of time before we understand what the disruptions are,‚Äù said Michael Wessel, a member of the U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission who has studied the growing reliance by the United States on Chinese pharmaceutical products.

Meanwhile, hospitals are training their staffs and circulating the latest guidance for screening patients and limiting the spread of the virus. At CommonSpirit Health ‚Äî a large Catholic hospital system with 142 hospitals created through the merger of Dignity Health, based in San Francisco, and Catholic Health Initiatives, based in Chicago ‚Äî patients and staff members are being instructed on how to distinguish coronavirus from the flu. It has already embedded screening questions in its electronic health records.

‚ÄúIt has not impacted our facilities at this time,‚Äù said Roy Boukidjian, vice president for infection prevention for CommonSpirit.

also, as far as i know, we don't know yet if it can be spread during the incubation period.  if it is, that would be a very serious problem as the incubation period is about ~~2 weeks~~ 1 week[1]!

Health care workers are always at high risk, and the death of a doctor treating patients in China reinforced the dangers.

Some nurses say they are better prepared now to protect workers. ‚ÄúWe all went through the Ebola virus a couple of years ago,‚Äù said Barbara Rosen, an official with Health Professionals and Allied Employees, a New Jersey union. ‚ÄúFor this round, everything seems very prepared.‚Äù

But Bonnie Castillo, the executive director of National Nurses United, which represents roughly 155,000 nurses, said some hospitals may not be fully prepared.

‚ÄúOur concern is that there is inadequate planning and training and also just basic staffing,‚Äù as well as the availability of supplies that protect nurses and patients from infection, she said.

Because the nature of the virus is still unknown, public health officials said it‚Äôs unclear what future challenges hospitals will face if the coronavirus spreads into an epidemic in the United States. While the current government guidelines call for patients to be treated in specialized isolation rooms, experts say it is unlikely that there will be enough isolation rooms at individual facilities.

And to manage the health of patients with severe respiratory illnesses, which coronavirus can cause, hospitals may find themselves without enough beds in their intensive care units or sufficient ventilators and other breathing equipment.

- Questions like these appear when there are a lot pressure to implement censorship, so I‚Äôm pretty sure we‚Äôre going to see a lot of it in the coming days, sadly
- Censorship does only drive normal people to more extremist places, so if you want to see those who think that the CCP numbers are fake ending up on conspiracy theories subs with people swearing it‚Äôs a bioweapon made by reptilian overlords, fine by me, I guess
- There isn‚Äôt a definitive truth. Example, for the 50c army, not trusting the CCP numbers **is** a conspiracy theory, Dr. Li‚Äôs claim **were** fake news, and they‚Äôre no different from claiming the thing is an American bioweapon made to hurt China
- If you‚Äôre going to draw a line in the sand, it means you hold the truth. You can say for example that ‚Äúrefuting CCP numbers is wrong‚Äù only when you also have access to the real numbers directly from hospitals. Etc. Where does your unbiased knowledge stop?
- Remember, we are in this situation today **because** moderators took on them to decide what fake news is, banned and censored people like Dr. Li ... I‚Äôm sure that most of them were just doing their job without malicious intent, like mods here. We‚Äôre supposed to learn from errors, not repeat them.
- This is one of the only thread that gives voice to oppressed Chinese, and spreads some of their videos that are censored by the CCP, and that they took tremendous risks and courage to share. Sad to see them get censored here as well.
- This a ‚ÄúCoronavirus‚Äù sub, not a peer-reviewed medical journal. Can‚Äôt we have real discussions about this topic, including anxiety and fears? Trying to calm fears by censoring the truth always backfires by the list of trust.

Anyway. I personally don‚Äôt see a problem in this thread, a good balance of minority of shills and doomers, and a majority of normal people. Moderation should stick to moderate the discussion and keep it civil outside of personal attacks, and keep harmful content out (like weird treatments that can harm health). But absolutely not try and decide what ‚Äútruth‚Äù is."

> 
> One sure sign of the regime‚Äôs fears is that it failed to stage a parade in central Pyongyang on Saturday, the 72nd anniversary of the founding of the country‚Äôs armed forces. Last year, Kim Jong Un himself presided over the procession that displayed the North‚Äôs latest missiles and other fearsome hardware along with goose-stepping soldiers in serried ranks.
> 
> This year, nothing about the nation‚Äôs nuclear warheads, much less the ‚Äúnew strategic weapon‚Äù that Kim has vowed to unveil. Rodong Sinmum, the newspaper of the ruling Workers‚Äô Party, merely cited the armed forces‚Äô supposed success combating ‚Äúsevere and dangerous difficulties‚Äù‚Äîand said nothing at all about the parade.
> 
> But reports have filtered out about Kim‚Äôs subjects falling prey to coronavirus despite the country‚Äôs decision to seal its 880-mile border with China, most of it along the Yalu River into the Yellow Sea to the west, and its 11-mile border with Russia where the Tumen River flows into the Pacific.
> 
> Among the first to report fatalities in North Korea, the Seoul-based website Daily NK said five people had died in the critical northwestern city of Sinuiju, on the Yalu River across road and rail bridges from Dandong, which is the largest Chinese city in the region and a key point for commerce with North Korea despite sanctions.
> ‚ÄúVictims had crossed the porous Yalu River border despite orders to cut off traffic from China.‚Äù
> 
> Daily NK, which relies on sources inside North Korea that send reports via Chinese mobile phone networks to contacts in China, said authorities had ‚Äúordered public health officials in Sinuiju to quickly dispose of the bodies and keep the deaths secret from the public.‚Äù
> 
> The victims had crossed the porous Yalu River border despite orders to cut off traffic from China as the disease radiated from the industrial city of Wuhan where the virus originated in December. As of Sunday, more than 700 people had died inside China.
> 
> One of the first patients in North Korea reportedly was hospitalized in Sinuiju ‚Äúwith symptoms similar to a cold and was given fever reducers and antibiotics,‚Äù said Daily NK, but the patient died as the fever rose.  Two more patients died two days later in another hospital in Sinuiju and another two in a nearby town.
> 
> North Korea‚Äôs worries about an epidemic are all the more intense because of its shortage of basic medicine and equipment. As cases mount, authorities are working feverishly to contain a disease that, if unchecked, could undermine Kim‚Äôs grip over his 25 million people, most of whom live in poverty worsened by hunger.
> 
> ‚ÄúBecause health conditions and health care in North Korea are so bad,‚Äù said Bruce Bennett, long-time analyst at the Rand Corporation, ‚Äúthey cannot allow the replication process to develop without severe intervention‚Äù‚Äîthat is, they have to take drastic steps to keep the virus from spreading fast.

> 
> Besides blocking international traffic, the North‚Äôs Korean Central News Agency reported the headquarters had ordered tests for everyone entering the capital city of Pyongyang by road and for anyone who had traveled outside the country. Foreigners working in Pyongyang, including those with diplomatic missions or non-governmental organizations, were banned temporarily from venturing outside for shopping. 
> 
> Even so, with hospitals and clinics largely bereft of needed supplies other than those serving the elite in the capital and elsewhere, a certain desperation was evident in the state media. Rodong Sinmun warned that ‚Äúthe fate‚Äù of the country was at stake, according to Yonhap, the South Korean news agency.
> 
> ‚ÄúNorth Korea lacks a vaccine or medical abilities,‚Äù said Bennett,‚Äùso they have to act by preventing the disease from coming into North Korea.‚Äù The point is to ‚Äúrapidly contain any leakage‚Äîexactly what they are trying to do by preventing people-to-people contacts.‚Äù
> 
> That‚Äôs virtually impossible, however, as long as people move illicitly across the border, carrying on low-level commerce in the need to survive a decrepit system. JoongAng Ilbo, a leading South Korean newspaper, cited anonymous source saying that a woman had been diagnosed in the capital and that all those with whom she had had contact had been quarantined.
> 
> Unlike in China, North Korea officially has denied any cases while attempting to get people to cooperate in stopping the spread of the disease.

> 
> ‚ÄúIt simply defies credibility that a country with a grossly inadequate public health infrastructure and a malnourished population, a country that depends on China for some 90 percent of its trade, and a country that had until recently opened itself up to a major influx of Chinese tourists in order to earn foreign exchange has avoided having a lot of victims,‚Äù said Revere. ‚ÄúThe total closure of the border and other measures Pyongyang has taken reflect a real sense of emergency in the North about the threat.‚Äù

> 
> By now, it may be too late for North Korea to stamp out all signs of the disease.
> 
> ‚ÄúSeveral suspected coronavirus infections have occurred in North Korea even though it shut all its borders,‚Äù said Chosun Ilbo, South Korea‚Äôs biggest-selling newspaper, citing anonymous sources. ‚ÄúThe infections most likely spread through porous parts of the border with China that see plenty of smuggling and other clandestine traffic,‚Äù said the paper, reporting suspected cases among those ‚Äúengaged in smuggling between the North and China.‚Äù
> 
> ‚ÄúBottom line,‚Äù said Steve Tharp, who‚Äôs been analyzing North Korean affairs as both an army officer and civilian expert for many years here, ‚Äúthe coronavirus has tightened up sanctions enforcement more than any other measure over the years because the North Koreans are actually self-enforcing the sanctions, against their will, through the tight closing of their borders in order to save the regime from being wiped out by this human pandemic coming.‚Äù
> 
> North Korean leaders, said Tharp, ‚Äúunderstand very well that this pandemic would rip through their population and be much more dangerous in North Korea than other places because of their inadequate medical infrastructure and the low resistance disease of the general population after so many years of surviving under near-starvation conditions.‚Äù

And, this study: First Case of 2019 Novel Coronavirus in the United States 

35 year old male - symptom progression day 1-12

https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2001191


On January 19, 2020, a 35-year-old man presented to an urgent care clinic in Snohomish County, Washington, with a 4-day history of cough and subjective fever. On checking into the clinic, the patient put on a mask in the waiting room. After waiting approximately 20 minutes, he was taken into an examination room and underwent evaluation by a provider. He disclosed that he had returned to Washington State on January 15 after traveling to visit family in Wuhan, China. The patient stated that he had seen a health alert from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) about the novel coronavirus outbreak in China and, because of his symptoms and recent travel, decided to see a health care provider....

Given the patient‚Äôs travel history, the local and state health departments were immediately notified. Together with the urgent care clinician, the Washington Department of Health notified the CDC Emergency Operations Center. Although the patient reported that he had not spent time at the Huanan seafood market and reported no known contact with ill persons during his travel to China, CDC staff concurred with the need to test the patient for 2019-nCoV on the basis of current CDC ‚Äúpersons under investigation‚Äù case definitions.8 Specimens were collected in accordance with CDC guidance and included serum and nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swab specimens. After specimen collection, the patient was discharged to home isolation with active monitoring by the local health department.
On January 20, 2020, the CDC confirmed that the patient‚Äôs nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabs tested positive for 2019-nCoV by real-time reverse-transcriptase‚Äìpolymerase-chain-reaction (rRT-PCR) assay. In coordination with CDC subject-matter experts, state and local health officials, emergency medical services, and hospital leadership and staff, the patient was admitted to an airborne-isolation unit at Providence Regional Medical Center for clinical observation, with health care workers following CDC recommendations for contact, droplet, and airborne precautions with eye protection.

On admission, the patient reported persistent dry cough and a 2-day history of nausea and vomiting; he reported that he had no shortness of breath or chest pain. Vital signs were within normal ranges. On physical examination, the patient was found to have dry mucous membranes. The remainder of the examination was generally unremarkable. After admission, the patient received supportive care, including 2 liters of normal saline and ondansetron for nausea.


On days 2 through 5 of hospitalization (days 6 through 9 of illness), the patient‚Äôs vital signs remained largely stable, apart from the development of intermittent fevers accompanied by periods of tachycardia (Figure 2). The patient continued to report a nonproductive cough and appeared fatigued. On the afternoon of hospital day 2, the patient passed a loose bowel movement and reported abdominal discomfort. A second episode of loose stool was reported overnight; a sample of this stool was collected for rRT-PCR testing, along with additional respiratory specimens (nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal) and serum. The stool and both respiratory specimens later tested positive by rRT-PCR for 2019-nCoV, whereas the serum remained negative.

Treatment during this time was largely supportive. For symptom management, the patient received, as needed, antipyretic therapy consisting of 650 mg of acetaminophen every 4 hours and 600 mg of ibuprofen every 6 hours. He also received 600 mg of guaifenesin for his continued cough and approximately 6 liters of normal saline over the first 6 days of hospitalization.


A chest radiograph taken on hospital day 3 (illness day 7) was reported as showing no evidence of infiltrates or abnormalities (Figure 3). However, a second chest radiograph from the night of hospital day 5 (illness day 9) showed evidence of pneumonia in the lower lobe of the left lung (Figure 4). These radiographic findings coincided with a change in respiratory status starting on the evening of hospital day 5, when the patient‚Äôs oxygen saturation values as measured by pulse oximetry dropped to as low as 90% while he was breathing ambient air. On day 6, the patient was started on supplemental oxygen, delivered by nasal cannula at 2 liters per minute. Given the changing clinical presentation and concern about hospital-acquired pneumonia, treatment with vancomycin (a 1750-mg loading dose followed by 1 g administered intravenously every 8 hours) and cefepime (administered intravenously every 8 hours) was initiated.


On hospital day 6 (illness day 10), a fourth chest radiograph showed basilar streaky opacities in both lungs, a finding consistent with atypical pneumonia (Figure 5), and rales were noted in both lungs on auscultation. Given the radiographic findings, the decision to administer oxygen supplementation, the patient‚Äôs ongoing fevers, the persistent positive 2019-nCoV RNA at multiple sites, and published reports of the development of severe pneumonia3,4 at a period consistent with the development of radiographic pneumonia in this patient, clinicians pursued compassionate use of an investigational antiviral therapy. Treatment with intravenous remdesivir (a novel nucleotide analogue prodrug in development10,11) was initiated on the evening of day 7, and no adverse events were observed in association with the infusion. Vancomycin was discontinued on the evening of day 7, and cefepime was discontinued on the following day, after serial negative procalcitonin levels and negative nasal PCR testing for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus.

On hospital day 8 (illness day 12), the patient‚Äôs clinical condition improved. Supplemental oxygen was discontinued, and his oxygen saturation values improved to 94 to 96% while he was breathing ambient air. The previous bilateral lower-lobe rales were no longer present. His appetite improved, and he was asymptomatic aside from intermittent dry cough and rhinorrhea. 

As of January 30, 2020, the patient remains hospitalized. He is afebrile, and all symptoms have resolved with the exception of his cough, which is decreasing in severity.

2020-02-09,true_rt,Coronavirus,11,https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/f1ix7y/more_north_korea_news_what_little_information/fh6ifvb/,"North Korea‚Äôs not saying a word about deaths or illnesses from the coronavirus, but the disease reportedly has spread across the border from China and is taking a toll in a country with a dismal health care system and scant resources for fighting off the deadly bug.

One sure sign of the regime‚Äôs fears is that it failed to stage a parade in central Pyongyang on Saturday, the 72nd anniversary of the founding of the country‚Äôs armed forces. Last year, Kim Jong Un himself presided over the procession that displayed the North‚Äôs latest missiles and other fearsome hardware along with goose-stepping soldiers in serried ranks.

This year, nothing about the nation‚Äôs nuclear warheads, much less the ‚Äúnew strategic weapon‚Äù that Kim has vowed to unveil. Rodong Sinmum, the newspaper of the ruling Workers‚Äô Party, merely cited the armed forces‚Äô supposed success combating ‚Äúsevere and dangerous difficulties‚Äù‚Äîand said nothing at all about the parade.

But reports have filtered out about Kim‚Äôs subjects falling prey to coronavirus despite the country‚Äôs decision to seal its 880-mile border with China, most of it along the Yalu River into the Yellow Sea to the west, and its 11-mile border with Russia where the Tumen River flows into the Pacific.


Among the first to report fatalities in North Korea, the Seoul-based website Daily NK said five people had died in the critical northwestern city of Sinuiju, on the Yalu River across road and rail bridges from Dandong, which is the largest Chinese city in the region and a key point for commerce with North Korea despite sanctions.


‚ÄúVictims had crossed the porous Yalu River border despite orders to cut off traffic from China.‚Äù
Daily NK, which relies on sources inside North Korea that send reports via Chinese mobile phone networks to contacts in China, said authorities had ‚Äúordered public health officials in Sinuiju to quickly dispose of the bodies and keep the deaths secret from the public.‚Äù

The victims had crossed the porous Yalu River border despite orders to cut off traffic from China as the disease radiated from the industrial city of Wuhan where the virus originated in December. As of Sunday, more than 700 people had died inside China.

One of the first patients in North Korea reportedly was hospitalized in Sinuiju ‚Äúwith symptoms similar to a cold and was given fever reducers and antibiotics,‚Äù said Daily NK, but the patient died as the fever rose.  Two more patients died two days later in another hospital in Sinuiju and another two in a nearby town.


North Korea‚Äôs worries about an epidemic are all the more intense because of its shortage of basic medicine and equipment. As cases mount, authorities are working feverishly to contain a disease that, if unchecked, could undermine Kim‚Äôs grip over his 25 million people, most of whom live in poverty worsened by hunger.

‚ÄúBecause health conditions and health care in North Korea are so bad,‚Äù said Bruce Bennett, long-time analyst at the Rand Corporation, ‚Äúthey cannot allow the replication process to develop without severe intervention‚Äù‚Äîthat is, they have to take drastic steps to keep the virus from spreading fast.

The country has just streamlined a headquarters to coordinate operations,  Rodong Sinmun reported, marshaling 30,000 workers to combat the epidemic.


Besides blocking international traffic, the North‚Äôs Korean Central News Agency reported the headquarters had ordered tests for everyone entering the capital city of Pyongyang by road and for anyone who had traveled outside the country. Foreigners working in Pyongyang, including those with diplomatic missions or non-governmental organizations, were banned temporarily from venturing outside for shopping. 

Even so, with hospitals and clinics largely bereft of needed supplies other than those serving the elite in the capital and elsewhere, a certain desperation was evident in the state media. Rodong Sinmun warned that ‚Äúthe fate‚Äù of the country was at stake, according to Yonhap, the South Korean news agency.

‚ÄúNorth Korea lacks a vaccine or medical abilities,‚Äù said Bennett,‚Äùso they have to act by preventing the disease from coming into North Korea.‚Äù The point is to ‚Äúrapidly contain any leakage‚Äîexactly what they are trying to do by preventing people-to-people contacts.‚Äù

That‚Äôs virtually impossible, however, as long as people move illicitly across the border, carrying on low-level commerce in the need to survive a decrepit system. JoongAng Ilbo, a leading South Korean newspaper, cited anonymous source saying that a woman had been diagnosed in the capital and that all those with whom she had had contact had been quarantined.


Unlike in China, North Korea officially has denied any cases while attempting to get people to cooperate in stopping the spread of the disease.  JoongAng Ilbo quoted a North Korean health official, Song In-bom, as having called on North Korean TV for ‚Äúcivil awareness‚Äù and unity in dealing with the disease while assuring his audience there had so far been no cases.

‚ÄúWe should expect that the virus would spread rapidly given the state‚Äôs inability to contain a pandemic.‚Äù
‚Äî Victor Cha and Marie DuMond in ‚ÄòBeyond Parallel‚Äô
‚ÄúI believe absolutely nothing of what I'm hearing from Pyongyang,‚Äù said Evans Revere, a former senior U.S. diplomat who specializes in North Korean issues.

‚ÄúIt simply defies credibility that a country with a grossly inadequate public health infrastructure and a malnourished population, a country that depends on China for some 90 percent of its trade, and a country that had until recently opened itself up to a major influx of Chinese tourists in order to earn foreign exchange has avoided having a lot of victims,‚Äù said Revere. ‚ÄúThe total closure of the border and other measures Pyongyang has taken reflect a real sense of emergency in the North about the threat.‚Äù


In fact, he went on, ‚ÄúI can't help but think it may also reflect panic if the number of patients is growing.‚Äù

Indeed, ‚Äúthe coronavirus arguably poses a unique threat to North Korea,‚Äù wrote Victor Cha and Marie DuMond of the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington in an article in Beyond Parallel, which is published by CSIS.

‚ÄúThe regime‚Äôs relative isolation from the international community hinders the widespread penetration of many diseases from abroad,‚Äù they wrote, but ‚Äúthe porous nature of the border with China and frequent travel is a clear vector for the virus‚Äô transmission.‚Äù Thus, ‚ÄúIf there are reports of the virus inside of North Korea, we should expect that the virus would spread rapidly given the state‚Äôs inability to contain a pandemic.‚Äù

By now, it may be too late for North Korea to stamp out all signs of the disease.


‚ÄúSeveral suspected coronavirus infections have occurred in North Korea even though it shut all its borders,‚Äù said Chosun Ilbo, South Korea‚Äôs biggest-selling newspaper, citing anonymous sources. ‚ÄúThe infections most likely spread through porous parts of the border with China that see plenty of smuggling and other clandestine traffic,‚Äù said the paper, reporting suspected cases among those ‚Äúengaged in smuggling between the North and China.‚Äù

‚ÄúBottom line,‚Äù said Steve Tharp, who‚Äôs been analyzing North Korean affairs as both an army officer and civilian expert for many years here, ‚Äúthe coronavirus has tightened up sanctions enforcement more than any other measure over the years because the North Koreans are actually self-enforcing the sanctions, against their will, through the tight closing of their borders in order to save the regime from being wiped out by this human pandemic coming.‚Äù

North Korean leaders, said Tharp, ‚Äúunderstand very well that this pandemic would rip through their population and be much more dangerous in North Korea than other places because of their inadequate medical infrastructure and the low resistance disease of the general population after so many years of surviving under near-starvation conditions.‚Äù"

2020-02-09,JigglymoobsMWO,news,10,https://www.reddit.com/r/news/comments/f1ih07/coronavirus_megathread_3/fh6sc70/,"A few things to remember:

The death rate based on confirmed case reports is likely to be much higher than the real per case fatality rate.  This is because confirmed cases over represent individuals with severe reactions to the virus.  For every person who shows up at the hospital with severe symptoms, there is likely to be several or more who don't even realize they are infected.

A virus with a lower fatality rate is easier to spread and harder to contain for the precise reason that most human carriers are asymptomatic or have unalarming symptoms.  According to Dr. Anthony Faucci, director of the NAIID in the US, his high level contacts in China have confirmed that asymptomatic transmission between persons is a ""certainty"" according to what Chinese health authorities are now observing on the ground.

The 1918 pandemic flu that killed tens of millions around the world had only a 1% fatality rate, but infected nearly 40% of the world.  The current corona virus probably have an actual fatality rate some where between 0.1% (normal flu season) and 1%, like the 1918 pandemic.  This makes it an exceptional public health threat.

The vast majority of the fatalities have been seen in the elderly or immune comprised individuals.  It does not seem to be a significant threat to healthy adults under age 50 or children.

As things stand it's still far too early to project whether the virus will be contained.  As it stands, Chinese government efforts are probably slowing down the spread but may not fully contain it.

Coronaviruses tend to spread better during winter months when the combination of cold temperatures and humidity help preserve the virus.  During the warmer, dryer months of the year viruses tend to spread less well.  This, it's possible that if the spread of the virus is slowed enough, the warming weather could help further slow the spread.

Vaccines are currently under development in the US and else where and maybe ready for wide deployment in about one year.  This is too slow to affect control efforts now, but may be able to help by next winter.

One resource for those wishing to get understanding of the virus is a series of interviews by the Journal of the American Medical Association with Dr. Anthony Faucci, long time director of the NAIID at the NIH and one of the foremost virology experts in the US:

It struck them that a routine cough or sneeze might draw sidelong looks from classmates worried about getting infected from a virus believed to have originated in China.
It struck them that the mere act of sitting down at a crowded table might prompt others to stand up and leave. It struck them that they might be targets of racial discrimination, said Tevinh Nguyen, a senior at Arizona State who is president of the Asian/Asian Pacific American Students‚Äô Coalition.
Nguyen said he and others are worried about those who are ‚Äúusing this public health rhetoric to justify xenophobia.‚Äù
AD

Across the country, colleges and universities in recent days have accelerated efforts to guard against a virus that causes respiratory illness and in some cases death. It poses a major public health challenge worldwide. But educators also are seeking to prevent outbreaks of hysteria and racism.
‚ÄúThis has been an intense learning moment for us, for our students, for everybody,‚Äù Arizona State President Michael Crow said Friday. He said the university has focused on disseminating accurate health information and making sure international and domestic students know the school upholds values of tolerance and diversity.
Arizona State kept its normal academic schedule despite a widely publicized online petition that urged the university to cancel classes because students were worried about coronavirus. Crow said the university is following its protocols for dealing with public health scares and keeping student groups informed.
AD

‚ÄúWe‚Äôve been working really hard to keep the environment on track,‚Äù Crow said.
Some schools have made missteps. Officials at the University of California at Berkeley apologized last month after the campus health center shared a handout in which xenophobia was listed as a ‚Äúnormal reaction‚Äù that some people might experience during the health crisis. The handout sparked widespread outrage.
‚ÄúStop normalizing racism,‚Äù a molecular virologist named Dustin R. Glasner, who is Asian American, wrote on Twitter. Glasner‚Äôs r√©sum√© notes he earned a doctorate at UC-Berkeley and is now a scholar at UC-San Francisco. ‚ÄúIt is not normal, and racist reactions to the current coronavirus outbreak are NOT OKAY.‚Äù University officials swiftly revised the handout and said they regretted ‚Äúany misunderstanding it may have caused.‚Äù
AD

Coronavirus fears weigh heavily on college campuses because they are major hubs of international academic exchange. Students and faculty travel frequently to all corners of the world ‚Äî including China.
There were more than 360,000 Chinese students in the U.S. higher education system in the last school year, according to the Institute of International Education, and tens of thousands more from other East Asian countries.
By Friday night, more than 34,000 coronavirus cases had been confirmed in China, the hardest-hit country. Of the more than 800 people who have died, nearly all are Chinese. The virus is spreading globally, but the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported just 12 cases and no deaths in the United States as of Friday.
AD

At Arizona State, university officials disclosed Jan. 26 that a person connected to the community had been diagnosed with the coronavirus. The person does not live in university housing, was not severely ill and was remaining in isolation to keep from spreading the illness, officials said.
Another case emerged at the University of Massachusetts at Boston. There, officials disclosed Feb. 1 that a young male student who had recently been in Wuhan ‚Äî the Chinese city at the center of the outbreak ‚Äî had been diagnosed with the coronavirus and was under observation.
Katherine Newman, the university‚Äôs interim chancellor, praised the campus response as restrained and empathetic.

‚ÄúI try to remind everyone that a virus can happen anywhere, to anyone,‚Äù Newman said. ‚ÄúWhat we have to do is take every precaution and remember who we are ‚Äî a campus that is very diverse with students from all over the world.‚Äù
Study finds fewer foreign undergraduates in U.S. colleges ‚Äî the first drop in 13 years

Academic experts say worries about the coronavirus can feed racial stereotypes that have long plagued not only Asian visitors and immigrants in the United States, but also Asian Americans.
‚ÄúThe notion of a disease originating in a faraway place in which people share the same ethnicity ‚Äî that has been a trope in the Asian American experience since Day One,‚Äù said Jason Oliver Chang, director of the Asian and Asian American Studies Institute at the University of Connecticut. He said campus communities must be vigilant to defend students against incidents of racism that might arise in a climate of ignorance and fear. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a combustible situation,‚Äù he said.


Student leaders, too, say stereotypes and hate speech must be confronted and denounced.
‚ÄúXenophobia has always targeted us, but the coronavirus has created new waves of racist rhetoric online, in schools and on our campuses,‚Äù said Shelley Shin, executive director of the East Coast Asian American Student Union.
Shin said the group is preparing for an annual conference this month in Pittsburgh. ‚ÄúWe are concerned for our safety not because of the coronavirus, but because of potential retaliation from other people who may see large groups of Asian Americans in hotels and restaurants and other public spaces and lash out,‚Äù Shin said.
Georgetown University‚Äôs student news outlet the Hoya pointed out Friday that jokes about the virus often aren‚Äôt funny. In an editorial headlined ‚ÄúAvoid Coronavirus Memes,‚Äù the editorial board lamented that the crisis is seen too often in the United States as a punchline. ‚ÄúThe university is not immune to the current worldwide increase in offensive anti-Asian rhetoric,‚Äù it said.
AD

At Arizona State, one student recounted a brief but painful incident she suspects was racially motivated and connected to virus fears. Aretha Deng, 20, a daughter of Chinese immigrants, said she recently approached a table of students and asked whether she could sit down to study with them. They assented, Deng said. But then they whispered among themselves, abruptly packed their stuff and left.
‚ÄúThese microaggressions .‚Äâ.‚Äâ. make us feel unwelcome and make us feel foreign, even in my case,‚Äù Deng said. ‚ÄúI was born in America.‚Äù"

HONG KONG¬†-- My dad looked disappointed when I arrived back from Hong Kong to spend the Lunar New Year holidays with family in the eastern Chinese city of Qingdao.

This year, my suitcase wasn't packed with chocolates, fine wines and premium Chungwha cigarettes. In their place were dozens of N95 masks and vitamin C supplements.

I arrived home on Jan. 23, two days before the Lunar New Year, a time when millions of Chinese families gather together. On that day, the city of Wuhan -- the epicenter of the new coronavirus -- was locked down in an attempt to prevent the spread of the disease. Five million people left the city before it was quarantined, and experts warned of dire consequences as human-to-human transmission was confirmed.

In Qingdao, a coastal city of 9 million that is more than 1,000 km from Wuhan, people were remarkably calm. Few wore masks on the streets, and wet markets were crowded with housewives hunting for fresh food to prepare for the year-end banquet.

But two days later, everything changed. People in my neighborhood woke up to the news that a man who returned from Wuhan spent two hours on the Qingdao subway, using four different lines, before showing symptoms of the virus. The number of deaths nationwide jumped to 41, with more than 1,000 cases."

Would also add that of some 575 Japanese evacuees from Wuhan, all were tested, and of these only 8 were infected; of these a full 50% (4 of them) were asymptomatic.

Thanks OP for the analysis, you make all excellent points. One very promising HIV drug cocktail (via Abbvie) has already entered clinical trials in China, as well as a new compound called remdesivir from Gilead, with a clinical trial in HK.

It's clear enough if you read the report:

*""""Periodical medical checks are being done and all the tests conducted on the inmates for possible coronavirus exposure have been negative till now,"" an ITBP spokesperson said.""*

*""""Four isolation beds have been kept prepared at the facility in case it is required and doctors from AIIMS and Safdarjung are visiting regularly to assist the medical team of the force that is posted here round-the-clock,"" the spokesperson said.""*

The entire report stresses that it's part of a routine of periodic checks that are being done on the quarantined individuals, and that the tests have shown negative **until now**. Doctors from AIIMS and Safdarjung continue to visit regularly to help the medical team that's posted round the clock.

**Nowhere** does it say that they're shutting up shop and closing down the facility because everyone turned up negative on the test. Nowhere is there any indication that the periodic tests are coming to a dead stop, the visits from AIIMS and Safdarjung about to cease. In fact, it says they are continuing.

>It is a FACT...let me repeat FACT that the response to this virus is unprecedented in history.

Bullshit. It's not unprecedented **anywhere in the world except China**. In fact, the WHO hasn't even declared it a pandemic yet, unlike many diseases in the past.

I guess people are not really worried yet because we've only had a couple of cases and no casualties. If we had a death count things would likely be much different.

>	I am a respiratory doctor of Wuhan University People‚Äôs Hospital
and a member of the coronavirus prevention and control expert group
Are you curious?
I am wearing an oxygen mask and I am infected with the virus.
When did it get infected? Who infected me?
This is a difficult question to answer.
Because I have contacted many patients,
because I was in the frantier,
I will definitely be infected and fall down one.
I watched the news this morning.
It was also very urgent.
There were many factors affecting the patient‚Äôs illness.
It was not easy to control it. It is still spreading.
And now the people still don‚Äôt know much about this.
They have much panic and fear.
As front-line doctors, my friends, I have my own opinions.
It is true that this is the case,
but some things are not necessarily the case.
The final victory is ours, don‚Äôt worry.
I will talk about that later. 
I was ill on January 14,
I had a fever of more than 38 degrees (100.4 freedoms)
Everything else was normal,
I didn‚Äôt have a runny nose, I didn‚Äôt cough,
I belched and farted
Why should I have a physical examination?
Because our departmen had a dinner on Friday 17th,
I realized whether it would be this reason.
So I called our hospital, They immediately gave me a CAT,
And found that my two lungs had problems.
It‚Äôs pneumonia
At that time, it wasn‚Äôt serious,
there wasn‚Äôt asthma, there wasn‚Äôt chest tightness,
Only fever,
it was OK the next day, it was OK the third day,
I could walk
After I did the CAT Reexamination,
bilateral lung pathological changes are increasing
That was what I knew already.
After CAT Reexamination,
the condition deteriorated rapidly and I never got up again.
Chest tightness. It‚Äôs hard to breathe.
I have to take oxygen.
Each day is heavier than the other.
I didn‚Äôt get up for five days.
On the fourth and fifth day, when it was very heavy,
I wondered if I would die.
I guess I have a 30% chance of death.
If I didn‚Äôt get better in four or five days,"

 At this point, the coronavirus has the potential to be the most significant   medical disruption in decades, but the cone of outcomes remains wide. As we show below, infections have continued to accelerate in recent days, as have deaths with the normal lead-lag. The coronavirus has already infected more people than SARS. The likely total number of cases is much higher, both because it takes time to detect them and because some triangulation (such as the share of foreigners evacuated from Wuhan who had the disease) suggests the outbreak is likely more widespread."

And, this study: First Case of 2019 Novel Coronavirus in the United States 

35 year old male - symptom progression day 1-12

https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2001191


On January 19, 2020, a 35-year-old man presented to an urgent care clinic in Snohomish County, Washington, with a 4-day history of cough and subjective fever. On checking into the clinic, the patient put on a mask in the waiting room. After waiting approximately 20 minutes, he was taken into an examination room and underwent evaluation by a provider. He disclosed that he had returned to Washington State on January 15 after traveling to visit family in Wuhan, China. The patient stated that he had seen a health alert from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) about the novel coronavirus outbreak in China and, because of his symptoms and recent travel, decided to see a health care provider....

Given the patient‚Äôs travel history, the local and state health departments were immediately notified. Together with the urgent care clinician, the Washington Department of Health notified the CDC Emergency Operations Center. Although the patient reported that he had not spent time at the Huanan seafood market and reported no known contact with ill persons during his travel to China, CDC staff concurred with the need to test the patient for 2019-nCoV on the basis of current CDC ‚Äúpersons under investigation‚Äù case definitions.8 Specimens were collected in accordance with CDC guidance and included serum and nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swab specimens. After specimen collection, the patient was discharged to home isolation with active monitoring by the local health department.
On January 20, 2020, the CDC confirmed that the patient‚Äôs nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabs tested positive for 2019-nCoV by real-time reverse-transcriptase‚Äìpolymerase-chain-reaction (rRT-PCR) assay. In coordination with CDC subject-matter experts, state and local health officials, emergency medical services, and hospital leadership and staff, the patient was admitted to an airborne-isolation unit at Providence Regional Medical Center for clinical observation, with health care workers following CDC recommendations for contact, droplet, and airborne precautions with eye protection.

On admission, the patient reported persistent dry cough and a 2-day history of nausea and vomiting; he reported that he had no shortness of breath or chest pain. Vital signs were within normal ranges. On physical examination, the patient was found to have dry mucous membranes. The remainder of the examination was generally unremarkable. After admission, the patient received supportive care, including 2 liters of normal saline and ondansetron for nausea.


On days 2 through 5 of hospitalization (days 6 through 9 of illness), the patient‚Äôs vital signs remained largely stable, apart from the development of intermittent fevers accompanied by periods of tachycardia (Figure 2). The patient continued to report a nonproductive cough and appeared fatigued. On the afternoon of hospital day 2, the patient passed a loose bowel movement and reported abdominal discomfort. A second episode of loose stool was reported overnight; a sample of this stool was collected for rRT-PCR testing, along with additional respiratory specimens (nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal) and serum. The stool and both respiratory specimens later tested positive by rRT-PCR for 2019-nCoV, whereas the serum remained negative.

Treatment during this time was largely supportive. For symptom management, the patient received, as needed, antipyretic therapy consisting of 650 mg of acetaminophen every 4 hours and 600 mg of ibuprofen every 6 hours. He also received 600 mg of guaifenesin for his continued cough and approximately 6 liters of normal saline over the first 6 days of hospitalization.


A chest radiograph taken on hospital day 3 (illness day 7) was reported as showing no evidence of infiltrates or abnormalities (Figure 3). However, a second chest radiograph from the night of hospital day 5 (illness day 9) showed evidence of pneumonia in the lower lobe of the left lung (Figure 4). These radiographic findings coincided with a change in respiratory status starting on the evening of hospital day 5, when the patient‚Äôs oxygen saturation values as measured by pulse oximetry dropped to as low as 90% while he was breathing ambient air. On day 6, the patient was started on supplemental oxygen, delivered by nasal cannula at 2 liters per minute. Given the changing clinical presentation and concern about hospital-acquired pneumonia, treatment with vancomycin (a 1750-mg loading dose followed by 1 g administered intravenously every 8 hours) and cefepime (administered intravenously every 8 hours) was initiated.


On hospital day 6 (illness day 10), a fourth chest radiograph showed basilar streaky opacities in both lungs, a finding consistent with atypical pneumonia (Figure 5), and rales were noted in both lungs on auscultation. Given the radiographic findings, the decision to administer oxygen supplementation, the patient‚Äôs ongoing fevers, the persistent positive 2019-nCoV RNA at multiple sites, and published reports of the development of severe pneumonia3,4 at a period consistent with the development of radiographic pneumonia in this patient, clinicians pursued compassionate use of an investigational antiviral therapy. Treatment with intravenous remdesivir (a novel nucleotide analogue prodrug in development10,11) was initiated on the evening of day 7, and no adverse events were observed in association with the infusion. Vancomycin was discontinued on the evening of day 7, and cefepime was discontinued on the following day, after serial negative procalcitonin levels and negative nasal PCR testing for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus.

On hospital day 8 (illness day 12), the patient‚Äôs clinical condition improved. Supplemental oxygen was discontinued, and his oxygen saturation values improved to 94 to 96% while he was breathing ambient air. The previous bilateral lower-lobe rales were no longer present. His appetite improved, and he was asymptomatic aside from intermittent dry cough and rhinorrhea. 

As of January 30, 2020, the patient remains hospitalized. He is afebrile, and all symptoms have resolved with the exception of his cough, which is decreasing in severity."

The family had pleaded for help, but the city‚Äôs hospitals, faced with an extreme shortage of beds, could not take them. On Feb. 1, Grandfather Zhang died at home.

‚ÄúThey tell us to wait,‚Äù thundered Ms. Zhang‚Äôs mother, Yang Ling. She nearly ripped the intravenous needle out of her hand as she waved her arms in frustration. ‚ÄúBut wait until when? We‚Äôve already lost one.‚Äù

The city of Wuhan, where the new coronavirus originated, is struggling to get the epidemic under control. The government has imposed a travel lockdown but that has exacerbated the challenge posed by its limited resources.

Overwhelmed and understaffed, hospitals have turned away many sick residents like the Zhangs, forcing them to go home and quarantine themselves in small apartments where they risk infecting other family members.

Nearly 17,000 people have been sickened in the city, and more than 680 have been killed, accounting for three-quarters of the total deaths in China from the virus. Faced with growing public anger and desperate to stop the spread, the authorities in recent days have been rounding up people with confirmed infections but only mild symptoms, and putting them in makeshift quarantine centers.

The government is converting sports stadiums and exhibition venues into these centers, and has said they will house, in total, more than 10,000 patients. Beds are arranged close together and in tight rows, raising concerns about whether such dormitory-like facilities could inadvertently help spread other infectious diseases among the patients.

Ms. Zhang, who was admitted to one of the centers on Thursday with her mother, a retiree, saw it as their only option to keep from infecting her father.

It was cold in the tall, repurposed exhibition center; bathrooms were limited; and there was little privacy. But the beds were heated with electric mattress pads, and medical teams checked their temperatures three times a day and gave out free medicines and meals.

‚ÄúAt least someone cares now,‚Äù she said in a telephone call from the quarantine center.

For Ms. Zhang‚Äôs family, the first signs of trouble emerged in the week leading up to the Lunar New Year, when her 70-year-old grandmother, who was in good health, had developed a fever and started coughing.

By then, the new virus had been spreading in the city for weeks, though officials had mostly played it down. Even after the government finally acknowledged that it could be transmitted among people, the family didn‚Äôt think it was at risk because they spent most of their time indoors. They took her grandmother to a clinic, where the doctor prescribed medicine for a cold and sent her home.

To contain the outbreak, the government restricted travel in and out of the city, shut down public transportation and banned most private cars on the roads. Like many of her fellow residents, Ms. Zhang was at first unworried. She posted memes on social media making light of the lockdown and passed the time by sorting trail mix.

Her grandmother, who was staying with them for the holidays, continued to cough. Her fever would not recede.

Then Ms. Zhang‚Äôs grandfather, already weak from lung cancer, suddenly took a turn for the worse. He had been using an oxygen machine to support his breathing for 30 minutes in the morning and again at night. Now he couldn‚Äôt breathe at all, and needed to be hooked up to the machine around the clock. He came down with a high fever. For four days he was so uncomfortable that he couldn‚Äôt sleep, Ms. Zhang said.

Desperate to find help, Ms. Zhang and her family called everyone they could think of. But the hospitals were all full. Emergency responders told them they needed to secure a hospital bed first before an ambulance could be sent.

Ms. Zhang was devastated to see her grandfather, who had helped raise her, nearing death. Overnight, her social media feed, normally full of food and travel photos, became a flood of urgent cries for help. In a last-ditch effort, she called a hotline for the city‚Äôs mayor. But an operator had no answers, and asked her what they planned to do.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre asking me, an ordinary citizen, how to resolve this?‚Äù she replied. She hung up.

That afternoon, her grandfather died in the family‚Äôs apartment.

Workers from a funeral home arrived to take his body away. They said that because he had possibly been infected with the virus, the family was not allowed to accompany the body and it had to be cremated immediately.

But they had no time to mourn. Ms. Zhang‚Äôs grandmother was now deteriorating rapidly. They took her to a hospital, where a doctor said that her lungs appeared on a CT scan as almost entirely white ‚Äî signs of severe pneumonia. She later tested positive for the coronavirus.

She needed to be admitted to one of the hospitals in the city designated to handle coronavirus patients. There, doctors might be able to monitor her vital signs, treat her with antiviral and anti-H.I.V. drugs and provide her with oxygen support.

But there were still no beds.

Doctors later told Ms. Zhang and her mother they were infected too. Her younger brother, Allen, also tested positive. They were all told to return home.

Her father, 50, was the only member of the family who had not been infected. He took to sleeping in the living room, away from the rest of them. They wore masks all the time, even as they slept, and took turns caring for the grandmother, who struggled to breathe and could barely get out of bed.

Ms. Zhang was convinced it was only a matter of time before her father was infected, as well. They did not have any disinfectants or N95 respirators, heavy-duty masks that better protect against the virus.

‚ÄúEvery day you‚Äôre living together, drinking and eating together, sitting together and watching the news,‚Äù Ms. Zhang said. ‚ÄúNo matter how hard you try, of course he‚Äôs going to get it.‚Äù

Her days quickly fell into a frantic routine.

She would take her grandmother to the hospital to see a doctor around midnight, when the lines were shorter, to get medication. During the day, she returned to the hospital with her mother and waited in line.

‚ÄúWhat kind of government is this?‚Äù Ms. Yang, with her daughter by her side, said in a rapid-fire local dialect, her voice carrying across the hospital courtyard. ‚ÄúThe news is always talking about how good everything is; they don‚Äôt even care about the ordinary people.‚Äù

It wasn‚Äôt just the government‚Äôs slow response to the expanding epidemic that was infuriating. It was what felt like the denial of basic dignity. After Grandfather Zhang died, she said, he was taken away ‚Äúlike a dead pig or a dead dog.‚Äù They still didn‚Äôt know where his ashes were and had no time to think about funeral arrangements.

‚ÄúI can‚Äôt even save the people who are alive,‚Äù Ms. Yang said.

‚ÄúNow, all we can do is beg the heavens,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúBegging anyone else is of no use.‚Äù"

> The centre looked mostly empty when The Straits Times visited the compound around 8am, with no visible movement save for a cleaner sweeping the floor just outside the door and a man delivering a few boxes of face masks.

> This comes after the Ministry of Health's announcement on Sunday (Feb 9) that a 71-year-old grandfather, who reported onset of symptoms on Feb 1, was confirmed to have the novel coronavirus infection last Saturday (Feb 8).

> The grandfather, Singapore's case 41, had picked up his grandchild at Pats Schoolhouse Kovan prior to hospital admission. He is now warded at the National Centre for Infectious Diseases.

> The couple who dropped off their son at Pats Schoolhouse Kovan on Monday said they had read news reports about the case but had not received any notice from the school that classes were being cancelled.

> But while they are worried, they said they believe the school will ""ensure a safe and clean environment for the children"".

> ST has asked Pats Schoolhouse for details of hygiene measures the centre has taken.

> Meanwhile, it was business as usual at Modern Montessori International at Kovan, another pre-school just 50m or so away.

> About 10 children were dropped off there by their parents in the 20 minutes ST was there.

> Ms Angeline Seah, 40, who arrived with her four-year-old daughter, said she had read about the case on Sunday night.

> ""It's fine. Everyone just has to do their part to practise good hygiene. You can't expect the children to stay indoors every day.

> But some were worried about the proximity of both pre-school centres.

> Madam Pan An Qi, a Chinese national who dropped her three-year-old grandson off at Montessori on Monday, said she had notheard the news yet.

> Her daughter and son-in-law are both permanent residents here.

> Madam Pan said: ""If I had known, I wouldn't have let my grandson go to school today. I won't bring him tomorrow.""

> But the 60-year-old, who has been in Singapore since last July to help take care of her grandson, added that the pre-school has stepped up hygiene measures in recent days.

> ""They sanitise the place well - you can smell it. And parents now are only allowed to drop their kids off at the gate, while in the past they could go in all the way to the classroom.""

\> The first major flaw in the Pentagon‚Äôs strategy is its treatment of great power competition with Russia and China, which it describes as the ‚Äúprincipal priorities for the department,‚Äù requiring ‚Äúincreased and sustained investment‚Äù because of its assessment of the magnitude of the threats they pose. But the United States already substantially [**outspends**](https://www.sipri.org/sites/default/files/2019-04/fs_1904_milex_2018.pdf) both nations on its military, outpacing China by a margin of roughly 2.5 to 1 and Russia by 10 to 1. And unlike those two powers, the United States has numerous capable allies in both Europe and Asia that can help address any challenges they pose to U.S. and global¬†security. 

&#x200B;

2020-02-09,Starcraftduder,investing,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/f1anfk/chinas_markets/fh4vli8/,"> I think the main one that you should try to back up is this idea that the virus affects people of Chinese ethnicity more than other groups.

I think you're right to be skeptical. Let me just preface that I specified a specific group of people to estimate the minimum negative impact of this disease. Because if this diseases spreads and affects people everywhere equally, then my already bad forecast will have to be revised to be a lot worse. In other words, I was giving a ""best case scenario"" for the outcome of this outbreak. The best case scenario is that this thing only causes severe symptoms in smokers from polluted parts of China. 

There was a study done regarding how this virus operated. It binds to ACE-2 receptors and it was shown East Asian males had the highest amount of ACE-2 receptors. I don't think this study is reliable because the sample size is laughably small. But it does correlate with the trends we see.

The trend is that out of the tens of thousands infected with this virus, I still haven't found a single non-Asian patient whose symptoms developed enough to require hospitalization. Remember that in Hubei, this thing if left untreated will require up to 25% of people to be hospitalized.

The hospitalizations that did occur in the West were all ethnically Asian. I could be wrong and there may be one or two exception but I started tracking this about two weeks ago trying to find any evidence that non-Asians can suffer serious symptoms from this virus. All the cases I've seen were extremely mild. For example, a super spreader spread this to 10 germans. The symptoms in the germans were so mild that they didn't even realize they were infected. Almost as soon as they were tested positive, they fully recovered without any hospitalization. It seems as if this virus which is devastating populations in China hardly even cause symptoms for non-Asians.

This is the same for the Russian, American, and other Western evacuees. The ones who were sick were ethnically Asian. And despite being in the epicenter of the outbreak in Wuhan, the non-Asians barely had any infections, and none of those infections required hospitalization.

The recent American death was ethnically Chinese.

So basically, it's been over 2 months since this thing has been spreading, and 5 million left Wuhan before the shut down, and we still don't see the virus taking off in non-Asian dominant countries. And we don't see any non-Asian patients have any severe symptoms.

>I also think the whole reinfection angle is not at all proven to be a serious issue. may be it will be, but we need more evidence that it is not only possible, but common.

Based on the epidemiologists and infectious disease experts I've read, they see this virus going in two direction. Either it mutates into something far less deadly and becomes just another coronavirus that hangs around but doesn't do much, or this becomes endemic and comes back every flu season as a deadlier version of our already deadly flus. So imagine a highly infectious and deadlier flu every year in addition to the flu viruses that killed 650,000 people.

Here's the source that has pretty authoritative experts:

‚ÄúI've observed that the breakout period of the novel coronavirus tends to be three weeks, from the onset of symptoms to developing difficulties breathing. Basically going from mild to severe symptoms takes about a week. There are all sorts of mild symptoms: feebleness, shortness of breath, some people have fevers, some don't. 

Based on studies of our 138 cases, the most common symptoms in the first stage are fever (98.6 per cent of cases), feebleness (69.6 per cent), cough (59.4 per cent), muscle pains (34.8 per cent), difficulties breathing (31.2%), while less common symptoms include headaches, dizziness, stomach pain, diarrhea, nausea, vomiting.

But some patients who enter the second week will suddenly get worse. At this stage, people should go to the hospital. The elderly with underlying conditions may develop complications; some may need machine-assisted respiration. When the body's other organs start to fail, that's when it becomes severe, while those with strong immune systems see their symptoms decrease in severity at this stage and gradually recover. So the second week is what determines whether the illness becomes critical.

The third week determines whether critical illness leads to death. Some in critical condition who receive treatment can raise their level of lymphocytes, a type of white blood cell, and see an improvement in their immune systems, and have been brought back, so to speak. But those whose lymphocyte numbers continue to decline, those whose immune systems are destroyed in the end, experience multiple organ failure and die.

For most, the illness is over in two weeks, whereas for those for whom the illness becomes severe, if they can survive three weeks, they're good. Those that can't will die in three weeks."

> SINGAPORE - Officials should not spread information prematurely as this could cause confusion and alarm during a crisis situation, said Minister-in-charge of the Public Service Chan Chun Sing on Sunday (Feb 9).

> ""Internally we will make sure that our processes are strengthened and our people involved in all these know their roles well,"" he said.

> Mr Chan was responding to questions from reporters about a Health Ministry press release on Friday announcing Singapore was moving to the orange disease outbreak status.

> While the news officially broke after about 5.20pm that day, an earlier version of the release had been leaked to the public several hours before and was circulating widely on WhatsApp and other channels.

> Mr Chan, who is also Trade and Industry Minister, said officials should have the discipline and maturity not to share information prematurely.

> But at the same time, in order to work fast during a crisis situation, information needs to be shared simultaneously with multiple agencies, he said.

> Mr Chan shared that when Singapore switched its Disease Outbreak Response System Condition (Dorscon) to orange, all ministries had to step up measures.

> The Government was able to execute changes within a few hours because it worked as a network where ""everybody chipped in"".

> Working on a purely hierarchical process would slow down the Government's response to contingencies, he added.

> Related Story Coronavirus: Get latest updates

> ""We should not swing to the other extreme because of this incident, and then therefore, slow down the whole process and in the end, fellow Singaporeans don't get the information in a timely manner,"" he said.

> Speaking to reporters after a walkabout in Jurong West, the minister also shared that business continuity plans have kicked in for various ministries after a joint advisory to employers by the Manpower Ministry, National Trades Union Congress and the Singapore National Employers Federation on Friday.

> Temperature checks and allowing staff to work from home were among some of the measures the advisory recommended following the shift to Dorscon orange.

> Mr Chan said that all private sector employers and public agencies should adopt such measures, and shared that ministries have started to make preparations for possible split team arrangements.

> ""(This will) make sure that we can continue to operate round the clock to serve Singaporeans, notwithstanding the challenges of the virus,"" he said.

The central banks never got off the debt addiction and so have kept rates very low through good times. Banks therefore don't have a lot of wiggle room to drop rates here to spur on the economy. 

Bonds rise when rates drop either as expected (telegraphed by Central banks..) or unexpected due to sudden shocks like Coronavirus. 

This is all expected. What wasn't expected in 2007/2008 was the severity of the situation and it was a situation where the correlation of stocks and bonds went from low to quite high (both moving down dramatically). Therefore cash was preferred. 

It's now beyond a tiny possibility that we could see a serious recession. But if something financially wierd started to happen because of this, it could become very bad very quick.

The state of Australia in the years after the Great Smoky Summer was one defined by turmoil. Politically, socially and economically the Commonwealth was in shambles; having lost both its capital, much of its federal body, and the nation‚Äôs second most populous city. Indeed, the island continent soon found itself devolving into various regional powers, the myriad remnant splinters of the federal government being unable to reconcile with each other nor able to stem the rise of the numerous movements throughout the country that pushed for a decentralised, even non-existent, government. To worsen the situation, the outbreak of the deadly coronavirus strain popularly known as the Hubei Virus in 2021 served to heighten insular thinking and to fan the flames of regional independence movements.  Such was the situation that by the close of 2024 and the dawn of the year 2025 AD, the majority of Australia was de facto independent of the factions claiming to be the true-blue Australian government.



Political bodies in this period could be defined according to the degree of power they maintained over their surrounding areas from their seat of powers. Foremost are the Four Provisional Governments, those political bodies who claimed to be the true successors of the federal government: the East Australian Provisional Government centred in Sydney, the West Australian Provisional Government centred in Perth, the Victorian Provisional Government centred in Geelong, and the Tasmanian Provisional Government centred in Hobart. 

Next come the Cliques, political bodies that did not claim to be the inheritors of the Commonwealth‚Äôs mantle but who were nonetheless major regional powers: the Riverina Clique, the Gippsland Clique, the Hume Clique, the Monaro Clique, the New England Clique, the Darling Downs Clique, the Fitzroy Clique, the Capricornia Clique, the Ross Clique, the Atherton Clique, the Isa Clique, the Kakadu Clique, the Mparntwe Clique, the Pilbara Clique, the Kalgoorlie Clique, the Eyre Clique, the Fleurieu Clique, and the Willyama Clique. 

Next are the Local Councils, political bodies comprising several townships that had banded together, the number of which is too many to list. 

Finally there are the Mobs, singular townships that found themselves in an indistinct area between organised body and unorganised gang. 

Sitting halfway between the political structures of Local Councils and the Mobs are the Homelands, primarily indigenous areas featuring a decentralised community centred around a singular hub town."

1/ According to the John Hopkins ESRI map at the time of writing, there are 37,549 people confirmed as infected by 2019-nCoV.

Right now it says there are 2,702 recovered and 813 deaths.

The 37,549 have to fall into one or other of the buckets: recovered or deaths.

If it happens in the proportion already reported, we are looking at a 33% death-rate.

I assume that's wrong, but why?  

2/ Further, assume it takes a few weeks to die from this disease, for example, Doctor Li: contact with virus 30 Dec; symptoms of infection on 12 Jan; died 6 Feb. A young man, but even so, from symptom to death it was 25 days.

If you go back on the timeline to one week ago there were 14,551 cases.  Two weeks ago, 2,801 cases.  And the deaths today are 813.  Since it takes weeks from diagnosis to death, the rate must be greater than the 2% claimed?

I assume that's also wrong, but why?

Generally do things that keep you in good health. Eat well, avoid drinking too much alcohol, try not to stress (including over coronavirus). Get your flu shot, if you haven't. Influenza season is in full swing, so you don't want to get a sucker punch to your system, then have 2019 n-Cov come around.

Maybe have some canned food on hand, some tissues, basic medicines, ibuprofen, etc.

If it starts spreading in a larger way in your town, and you're a student, try to find ways to limit your exposure. Maybe group up with students and tape and share lectures, for example. Ask your professors about online classes, if that's possible.

Lots of commonsense ways to reduce exposure, if it starts. For now, remain calm and take some basic precautions and preparedness steps."

Their Canadian coworkers were even trying to raise the alarm when it was happening that they thought something was up. After the Chinese scientists were ‚Äúexcused‚Äù from Canada, they went back to China, and the level 4 bio lab opened up for ‚Äúbusiness‚Äù. Governments and groups all over the west were concerned a couple years ago about the Chinese operating level 4 bio labs. They were concerned about a possible breach from carelessness or a lack of a sufficient protocol. Groups were concerned so much so that Bill and Melinda Gates held an event to do modeling of preparedness for a potential coronavirus-like pandemic. Look it up. It was called Event 201. Then, not 2 months after that event was held, an outbreak of a Coronavirus happened in Wuhan, less than 20 miles from the bio lab everyone was worried about. In fact, google maps and other map apps that have maps of China are completely inaccurate. It‚Äôs well known that the only people allowed to map China are Chinese government-owned mapping firms. Google and others must rely on the maps given to them by these Chinese firms. And, before the firms give them the accurate maps they make, they run them through an algorithm that changes the distances between places and the direction of these distance changes in a completely random way. The only way to accurately know where everything is in China, and how far away it is from other things, is to have this algorithm and reverse engineer the changes. Take a look for yourself. Open google maps (or Apple Maps, or whatever) and zoom in on the border between mainland China and Hong Kong. Look at a bridge or other landmark in the water/between the borders of China and other territories or countries. You will see it doesn‚Äôt line up correctly. My point is, that Wuhan lab could be right next to that wet market, and not 20 miles away. Someone could‚Äôve walked out of that lab with a Coronavirus on their shoe by accident.

They'll be delayed, but *far* from ""all gone."" Actually, the most important innovation to AI will *benefit* from a Chinese collapse (it's unrelated to the cost of electronics, and that's all I'll say on that matter), but it's best to wait and see on that one. 


Beyond that, I've written a bit about what's likely to happen...

____________________


I've been mentioning this elsewhere.

What happens next really depends on which demographic is most affected by coronavirus. 

China's probably screwed either way, but if coronavirus *does* live up to the hype and spreads around the world, geopolitics will become radically different within just a few years. 

And like I said, it all comes down to the most victimized demographic. 

If it's the Boomers (those 65 and older), then the main power bloc for the CCP is finished. Much of the Chinese youth don't really support the CCP, and the CCP knows this. This is for a variety of reasons of course. Just with at Tiananmen, there are likely millions upon millions who despise how the Chinese ""Communist"" Party has totally betrayed communist principles and followed the lead of all the other failed socialist movements in the process, somehow becoming the worst of both worlds: neither democratic and open to the populace nor revolutionary in spirit, thus basically becoming this bizarro mixture of capitalism and statism under a communist flag. The Tiananmen protesters, by and large, were student radicals, demsocs, and whatnot who hated China's new market-oriented direction, and that sentiment hasn't gone away. Likewise, there are also millions and millions of Chinese youths who think the whole communist experiment as a whole was rotten from the start, hence why the CCP liberalized the economy but kept hold onto power themselves. It wouldn't take much to incite them to want to overthrow the CCP either, and at least for a time, these two factions could work together. 

The elder generation are the ones most in support of the CCP. They're the ones who saw China go from literal pissbasket-tier poverty all the way to having a standard of living (in cities) equal to that of Western nations. Considering the miserable state China was in beforehand, it's clear that the CCP is doing something right. It's easy to forget just *how* sick China was before 1948, after all; the Great Leap Forward was the worst of them, but it was not the first famine or disaster in 20th century China that killed tens of millions; only the first under the Communist Party. And most who lived through it probably would've said that the Sino-Japanese War and Chinese Civil War were just as bad, if not worse, because of how dire and disunited China was during those times. Moving on from *that* is exactly why the CCP has their support.

There are more elders than youths, which is a big problem in China and is something that'll eventually drag down the economy (see: Japan). A lingering ""filial piety"" culture isn't helping (though it's not as strong as it once was), meaning that you tend to defer to elders. 

Lose the 65+ crowd and you'd probably lose a *massive* power bloc for the CCP, introducing a shitload of instability almost overnight. Maybe not enough to throw off the CCP, but certainly enough to force them to extreme measures (which *may* include democratic reforms, though obviously heavily controlled with Pakistan-tier ""democracy""). If the USA were smart and hadn't lost international support, we'd be able to force other nations to maintain the travel & trade bans with China beyond the coronavirus pandemic in an attempt to force the CCP out, but that's probably off the table at this point.


China's in a pickle, though. Losing the youth will always be worse than losing the elderly because the youth is where you get the majority of your national productivity, and they're the ones who support the elderly. Lose the youth, and the elderly get choked and have to rely on the government for more assistance, which becomes tragic if the government collapses. If coronavirus attacks the youths (in a manner similar to H1N1), then the CCP might initially have a much *stronger* grip on power since the generation that doesn't trust them will be thinned out, but China *needs* as many able-bodied youths as it can get. Otherwise, its labor market will be hollowed out and its economy will be unable to function. Its military have a smaller pool of candidates to boot, reducing their already pitiful power projection. 

This on top of medical costs being astronomical trying to deal with this, plus the loss of business revenue as a result of these shutdowns and quarantines.

There's no way for China to win this; coronavirus *will* fuck them up if it deteriorates. Their only recourse is their massive population being used to buffer the effects, but losing 10,000,000 people is *going* to have a negative effect no matter what, especially in a rising power. 


It's not much better in the United States of course. The Republican party's main power base is the 65+ crowd, and if that's the main death demographic of coronavirus, I don't need to tell you what happens next. If even 1 million Boomers were to die of coronavirus, the 2020 election would basically be handed to the Democrats; if 10 million died, the GOP would be unviable in more than half the country for decades. Likewise, if coronavirus mainly targets the youths (the main demographic for Democrats), we'd see the Dems lose just by double-digits in even Democratic strongholds. The loss of able-bodied youths means the economy takes a massively drastic hit (and the elderly now have far less support & social security) and the military has to go on high alert because they won't be able to afford losing any more fresh blood.

It'd just be a pisser all around. But the USA is in a better state to recover; the most that'd change with us is one party being reinforced for a decade or two and/or an economic depression, which would obviously have some very noticeable effects, but wouldn't be ""fall of Washington DC"" bad."

How many people do you have to put in a room so that the probability of some pair of them share a birthday exceed 50%?

Intuitively, you might answer 365/2 = 182. But actually, you just need 23.

Now go back to the coronavirus. There are 15k infected in Wuhan. We don't know how many families there are among those infected. But we can try estimated them.

We know the upper bound is 15k / 3 = 5k families. But there are unlikely actually that many, as there will be unmarried people infected, and having one of the family members infected doesn't necessarily mean the entire family will be (though likely, as nCoV transmit via close contact). So, as a very rough estimate, we can say there are 1.5k families infected. And we expect to see approx. 608 (deaths in Wuhan) * (1.5k * 3 / 15k) = 182 deaths among them.

Now, how many deaths have to happen in those 1.5k families so that the probability two of those deaths occur in the same family exceed 50%?

The probability calculation is slightly different from the birthday problem. But it comes out to be about 56 deaths. And if we have 182 deaths, the probability two of them are in the same family exceeds 99.95%

And early case-mortality estimates support this. Mortality rates outside of Hubei province are less than 0.2%. The first generations of novel coronavirus were more lethal (over 5%) but they were too lethal for their own good. The viruses that are better at propagating are less lethal and thus evolution happens quickly.

At the same time other statistics suggest that we're turning the corner - the rate of infection is stabilizing and might even be shifting from exponential growth to decay. My guess (and I'm not an expert) is between 100k and 500k confirmed cases before it becomes so mild that it's not worth tracking any more. No more than a few thousand deaths. 

And that's a disaster, no mistake, but it's tiny compared to disease in general.

Timescale is a few more months. I don't expect the epidemic to be a meaningful news story by summer, though there is a chance that it may reemerge in the fall."

Same case applies to the rainforests of southeast asia, if not even more so. They contain. 3x the biodiversity of the Congo or Amazon rainforests which is essential to creating new medical vaccines and treatments, and is undergoing rapid deforestation due to an increased demand for palm oil

There is a real risk that someone with the virus does run the marathon (just the law of big numbers) and if that happens, regardless of your health, you‚Äôre looking at potential difficulty getting back home and a prolonged quarantine period once you do. Think of all the healthy people stuck in a quarantined cruise ship. All the folks in the middle of CNY trips who then had their return flights to the US cancelled and got stranded.

On January 30, the government ordered Bruneian citizens and permanent residents who have visited China recently to undergo self-isolation for 14 days.

As of press time, 158 people are under self-quarantine in Brunei. Nineteen have already completed their isolation and been cleared ‚Äìthey comprise Bruneians studying in China, travellers as well as Hengyi Industries workers.

In an interview with The Scoop, Dr Hjh Anie said most Bruneians will likely undergo self-isolation at home, but the government has to provide monitoring centres in case their homes are not suitable for quarantine.

‚ÄúThere are also cases where foreign travellers entering Brunei are suspected of having the virus or have been in contact with confirmed cases, they will be placed at the monitoring centres,‚Äù the director added.

Whereas the National Isolation Centre in Tutong is for people who have confirmed cases of infectious disease, or have recently been to Wuhan, China ‚Äì ground zero of the outbreak.

Dr Hjh Anie added: ‚ÄúThose undergoing self-isolation are usually [in good health], and do not have the symptoms but we want to make sure that within the 14 days they don‚Äôt develop symptoms.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs important to have self-isolation and quarantine is so that if an individual develop symptoms they can be given medical attention quickly.‚Äù

Two Bruneians were directly evacuated from Wuhan on Friday and arrived in the sultanate on a Royal Brunei Airlines flight at 2.45am on Saturday.

They were identified as 26-year-old student Abd Najib Hj Abd Ladi and a 40-year-old man who was visiting Wuhan as a tourist.

Dr Hjh Anie said the two Bruneians have been quarantined at the National Isolation Centre because they were repatriated from the epicentre of the pandemic.

‚ÄúThey are well, and do not show any symptoms at the moment,‚Äù she added.

The director also called on Bruneians not to discriminate against people of Chinese descent following reports of anti-Chinese sentiment over coronavirus fears in other countries.

She said there had been incidents where tourists from Hong Kong and Taiwan reported not feeling welcome in Brunei since the outbreak began.

If you've been potentially exposed to coronavirus in some way e.g. you've just finished the 2 week quarantine after returning from China, there's a coronavirus serology test (blood test) and respiratory tract test (cough up sputum into a jar) that hospitals/GPs can order with DHHS approval. You only do the second if you've been coughing up phlegm. The blood test comes back within 1-2 days. A lot of GPs are handballing to hospital EDs because they don't feel confident ordering these tests, but they can. 

If you haven't been exposed to coronavirus e.g. no overseas travel and no contacts with people who had recent overseas travel to Asia, then you can just visit your GP. They'll ask you if you've been coughing/sneezing/other symptoms, take your temperature, listen to your lungs, and write a certificate that you have no risk of carrying coronavirus. If you've had a more serious infection e.g. pneumonia they might do more investigations, but without exposure risk factors they are not likely to do coronavirus testing (because it would come back negative).

Fear of coronavirus is wreaking financial havoc on Adelaide‚Äôs Chinatown.

Several shops have already shut down and more expected to close in the coming days.

Traders who rely mostly on Chinese customers are reporting downturns of up to 80 per cent with those who have mixed clientele down 30 to 40 per cent, says Adelaide City Councillor Simon Hou.

The crippling situation has sparked a public plea to by him to ‚Äúcome back in ‚Äì we need you‚Äù.

Mr Hou raised the issue with federal trade minister Simon Birmingham on Friday afternoon and will move a motion at an ACC meeting on Tuesday night for affected traders to be given rate relief and other support.

‚ÄúChinatown is shutting down ‚Äì I have never seen anything like this,‚Äù Mr Hou said.

He has asked the Gouger St Traders Association to prepare a report of exactly what hardships businesses are experiencing, including a comprehensive list of which ones have temporarily closed and which are likely to shut up shop this week.

Mr Hou says many people have stopped coming to the Chinatown since news broke of confirmed cases of coronavirus in SA, more than two weeks ago.

Popular, decades-old inner city Chinese restaurant Ding Hao is feeling the heat with manager Jenny Zhang estimating patronage is down 50 per cent.

Ms Zhang, who has operated the Cantonese eatery for more than 20 years, says if things don‚Äôt soon return to normal, she will be forced to put off some of her 15 staff members.

‚ÄúIt is very bad ‚Ä¶ people have been scared to come out and many have stopped wanting to go to a Chinese restaurant,‚Äù she said.

‚ÄúWe are usually very busy at lunchtime and dinner, especially on Saturday and Sunday, we are always are fully packed and there are people waiting, we‚Äôll turn over the tables as many as three times per sitting.

‚ÄúHowever, last Sunday was very quiet ‚Äì I have never seen a Sunday like it before in which we had seats empty.

‚ÄúIn all the different situations we have been through, we‚Äôve seen nothing like this ‚Ä¶ even in 2003 with SARS it didn‚Äôt impact us (like this is) ‚Ä¶ even local Chinese people are saying, ‚Äòdon‚Äôt come out, it is better to stay home‚Äô.‚Äù

Ms Zhang said there was no reason to stop eating out at restaurants such as hers.

‚ÄúWe are safe, there is no need to be scared, we have no one working here who has travelled overseas to China, if people were to come back from overseas to work, we would ask them to stay away for 14 days,‚Äù she said.

Adelaide couple Shelaye Boothey and Richard Kruschel are regulars at Ding Hao and say they were taken stunned by the lack of customers last weekend.

‚ÄúThere is usually a line up out the door on the weekend ‚Ä¶ we were so shocked when we went on Sunday as there were about a third of the usual diners, the entire length of Gouger Street was eerily quiet,‚Äù Ms Boothey said.

The Sunday Mail got mixed reactions from business owners in Chinatown with many not wanting to comment.

A Moonta St trader agreed business was ‚Äúa quieter than normal‚Äù, pointing to the strip in front of his eatery and saying there were less customers than usual.

Meanwhile, the doors of a Grote St eatery were witnessed being closed at 12.21pm.

However, a Gouger St restaurateur says her business, frequented mostly by local professionals, hasn‚Äôt been impacted by the coronavirus scare.

‚ÄúWe‚Äôve seen a steady decline in trade in this area over the past couple of years but many things are contributing to that ‚Äì the economy, roadworks and more recently the bushfires ‚Ä¶ these days it is just unpredictable,‚Äù she said."

It‚Äôs a wild overstep to call 911 when you already have a URI diagnosis.

Diarrhea may be a secondary path of transmission for the novel coronavirus, scientists said Friday following the publication of the¬†latest study¬†reporting patients with abdominal symptoms and loose stool.The primary path is believed to be virus-laden droplets from an infected person's cough, though researchers in early cases have said they focused heavily on patients with¬†respiratory symptoms¬†and may have overlooked those linked to the digestive tract.

A total of 14 out of 138 patients (10 percent) in a Wuhan hospital who were studied in the¬†new paper¬†by Chinese authors in the¬†Journal of the American Medical Association¬†(JAMA) initially presented with diarrhea and nausea one or two days prior to development of fever and labored breathing.

""Importantly, 2019-nCoV has been reported elsewhere in the feces of patients with atypical abdominal symptoms, similar to SARS which was also shed in urine, suggesting a fecal transmission route which is highly transmissible,"" William Keevil, a professor of environmental healthcare at the University of Southampton said in a comment to the UK's Science Media Centre.The possibility is not totally surprising to scientists, given that the new virus belongs to the same family as SARS.

Fecal transmission of SARS was implicated in sickening hundreds in Hong Kong's Amoy Gardens housing estate in 2003. A rising plume of warm air originating in bathrooms contaminated several apartments and was transported by wind to adjacent buildings in the complex."

2. It's prefab, so a lot of the vital components and rooms could be delivered and bolted in on-site instead of scratch-built

In mid-December, a risk benchmark for the U.S. stock market known as the SKEW Index‚Äîaka the Black Swan index‚Äîhit one of its highest levels ever, higher than 99.8% of all other daily readings since 1990, which is how far back data extend.

Even more incredibly, December‚Äôs high (at 150.14) was 31% higher than the SKEW‚Äôs average reading of 114.5 during the 2007-09 financial crisis.

The SKEW index is published by Cboe (formerly the Chicago Board Options Exchange) and uses options prices to measure the perceived risk of crashes or other unpredictable events that would have extremely negative market consequences, which traders call tail risks or Black Swan events.

Not surprisingly, many on Wall Street interpreted December‚Äôs near-record high to mean that traders had become convinced that one of these awful events had become much more likely.

In fact, however, December‚Äôs high SKEW reading most likely meant something else entirely, says Jessica Wachter, a finance professor at the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania. Far from indicating a widespread worry about a Black Swan event, she says, it probably signified that the consensus among traders had become significantly more optimistic.

The reason for this, Prof. Wachter says, is that a high SKEW reading in essence means that there is a significant pocket of aggressive bearishness that is far outside the range of opinions among everyone else. She points out that a rising SKEW reading therefore doesn‚Äôt automatically mean that any erstwhile bulls have become aggressively bearish. It instead could indicate that the mainstream consensus has become significantly more bullish.

While both scenarios open up a larger distance between the mainstream and the pocket of superbears, and lead therefore to a higher SKEW reading, only one has the significance that most assume upon hearing that the Black Swan index is at a new high.

Indeed, Prof. Wachter says, the SKEW will most likely fall as the mainstream becomes more bearish. That‚Äôs because that increasing bearishness will reduce the distance between the consensus view and that of the superbears. This explains why the SKEW was lower during the financial crisis than in December: The superbears, who quite possibly were no more bearish during that crisis than they had been previously, suddenly found themselves less outside the mainstream.

An analysis of SKEW readings since 1990 confirms Prof. Wachter‚Äôs argument: On average, the SKEW has been higher when the stock market over the trailing year has been strongly positive. The SKEW is also strongly correlated with the prevailing mood among short-term market timers in stocks, according to data from the Hulbert Financial Digest: When the timers‚Äô average recommended equity exposure is higher, so on average is the SKEW.

Contrarians, who bet against the mainstream, therefore need to view the SKEW in an entirely different way. Rather than seeing a high SKEW reading as evidence of widespread and extreme bearishness (which, per contrarian logic, would be a positive omen), they should view it as a likely sign that there is widespread bullishness among options traders (which contrarians would view as a reason for caution).

The SKEW was at 134.48 Friday, well below its mid-December high of 150.14, indicating there isn‚Äôt as much bullishness now as six weeks ago. Nevertheless, the SKEW is still much higher than the three-decade average of 119.6, indicating that even with widespread fears about the economic impact of the coronavirus, short-term traders are still unusually bullish.

Contrarians take note."

Let's say the crematoriums usually run 12 hours a day, including weekends, and are able to process 397 bodies a day within that 12 hours. Crematoriums are now running 24 hours a day, and forgoing funeral rites and other such practices. At a bare minimum, they should be able to use the doubled time to deal with up to 800 bodies per day. On average, 397 of those 800 bodies are deaths unrelated to the coronavirus. That means 24 hour running crematoriums can handle 403 coronavirus bodies per day, minimum. Up until Feb 6th (I don't have further data) the highest recorded daily death toll was 73, meaning that on that day the crematoriums would have had to deal with ~470 total bodies, +/- an expected amount from day to day variation. 397 people die per day on average, so you can guarantee that 470 is a number not too uncommon, akin to a busy day, maybe an hour or two of overtime, if that. Not 24 hour shifts.

In conclusion, either the crematoriums are sitting on their asses 12 hours a day, or the death toll is far far higher than reported."

The pharmaceutical industry in Puerto Rico encompasses more than half of all manufacturing done in Puerto Rico. As the island's most prominent industry, pharmaceutics generates more than 18,000 jobs, pays more than US$3 billion in taxes, comprises about half of total exports, and has generated more than 25% of the island's GDP for the past four decades. Comparatively, Puerto Rico is the fifth largest area in the world for pharmaceutical manufacturing with more than 80 plants, including:



Pharmaceutical companies originally came to Puerto Rico in the late 1960s and 1970s to take advantage of the now-expired federal tax incentive known as Section 936. This incentive allowed U.S.-based manufacturers to send all profits from local plants to stateside parent plants without having to pay any federal taxes.

Maybe I thought this was a different article because I didn‚Äôt see anything that mentioned a quarantine in the one I read.

Yes, that's part of the ignorance I was talking about.

India has dozens of quarantine facilities spread all over the country that are routinely used for any infectious diseases detected at ports of entry.

Before the Wuhan evacuation, India set up two brand new completely separate quarantine facilities, just for these evacuees. One at the Indo-Tibetan Border Security Force camp in Haryana, the other in Delhi. Both quarantine hospitals have their own special isolation wards, complete with HEPA filters and negative pressure atmospheres to keep pathogens from leaking out.

Both have medical personnel from Delhi's best hospitals visiting regularly to monitor the quarantined individuals. Both continue to test them routinely.

Right after China announced the epidemic, India ramped up testing laboratories for this new coronavirus. Over two dozen labs were provisioned to test swabs from patients to test for coronavirus. That is in addition to the National Institute of Virology in Pune, a world-class facility for studying viral pathogens. The current best bet for a vaccine (from CSIRO in Australia) is made by a team [headed by an Indian scientist](https://www.csiro.au/en/Research/Health/Infectious-dieases-coronavirus/coronavirus), who actually worked at Pune.

Not to mention, India is the world's largest manufacturer of anti-virals (and many other pharmaceuticals). And the biggest producer of anti-HIV medications which have been found helpful for corona virus.

>And as I said before, in America we haven‚Äôt seen this kind of response since the smallpox epidemic in the 60‚Äôs.

Who gives a fuck? This story isn't about America, it's about India. A tropical country, where infectious diseases are a fact of life for a billion people. They have a **lot of experience** in handling infectious diseases, quarantines, isolation and containment procedures."

I am really interested to know more about the Coronavirus, and I am open to see new breakthroughs in clinical research because this could shape our future in this medical jeopardy we are currently battling with the new virus. I am currently specialised in a CDC setting and this will really come in handy for me in the future. Having a Software Engineer with a background in statistics really engaged the both of us as we discussed a lot of news and topics about the virus, and to be honest I felt that it is a fun time for the both of us as a couple with polar opposites in our careers. 

However, when I talked about it with my fellow colleagues, they'll just think of me as a maniac talking about this disease, told me off to just ""think of it as just a flu, you should know this,"" or ""stop trying to scare us with your weird topics.""

I really want to change how nurses think, and just stop following by the book and have some time to actually embark on a journey, attain new knowledge and know more about medical breakthroughs rather than talk about drama in the ward about that other nurse, or just silence other people just because they think they're right. I hate how superficial nurses are nowadays. Pretty much sums up why they're mostly wrinkly and on the ugly side."

Are Western governments lieing to citizenry through lies of omission? I would assume so, just so the private market doesn't buy up critical resources like N95 masks etc.

I bought extra groceries, canned protein, water bottles and a big bag of rice. Try and have some extra cash and keep the gas tank topped off.

And, this study: First Case of 2019 Novel Coronavirus in the United States 

35 year old male - symptom progression day 1-12

https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2001191


On January 19, 2020, a 35-year-old man presented to an urgent care clinic in Snohomish County, Washington, with a 4-day history of cough and subjective fever. On checking into the clinic, the patient put on a mask in the waiting room. After waiting approximately 20 minutes, he was taken into an examination room and underwent evaluation by a provider. He disclosed that he had returned to Washington State on January 15 after traveling to visit family in Wuhan, China. The patient stated that he had seen a health alert from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) about the novel coronavirus outbreak in China and, because of his symptoms and recent travel, decided to see a health care provider....

Given the patient‚Äôs travel history, the local and state health departments were immediately notified. Together with the urgent care clinician, the Washington Department of Health notified the CDC Emergency Operations Center. Although the patient reported that he had not spent time at the Huanan seafood market and reported no known contact with ill persons during his travel to China, CDC staff concurred with the need to test the patient for 2019-nCoV on the basis of current CDC ‚Äúpersons under investigation‚Äù case definitions.8 Specimens were collected in accordance with CDC guidance and included serum and nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swab specimens. After specimen collection, the patient was discharged to home isolation with active monitoring by the local health department.
On January 20, 2020, the CDC confirmed that the patient‚Äôs nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabs tested positive for 2019-nCoV by real-time reverse-transcriptase‚Äìpolymerase-chain-reaction (rRT-PCR) assay. In coordination with CDC subject-matter experts, state and local health officials, emergency medical services, and hospital leadership and staff, the patient was admitted to an airborne-isolation unit at Providence Regional Medical Center for clinical observation, with health care workers following CDC recommendations for contact, droplet, and airborne precautions with eye protection.

On admission, the patient reported persistent dry cough and a 2-day history of nausea and vomiting; he reported that he had no shortness of breath or chest pain. Vital signs were within normal ranges. On physical examination, the patient was found to have dry mucous membranes. The remainder of the examination was generally unremarkable. After admission, the patient received supportive care, including 2 liters of normal saline and ondansetron for nausea.


On days 2 through 5 of hospitalization (days 6 through 9 of illness), the patient‚Äôs vital signs remained largely stable, apart from the development of intermittent fevers accompanied by periods of tachycardia (Figure 2). The patient continued to report a nonproductive cough and appeared fatigued. On the afternoon of hospital day 2, the patient passed a loose bowel movement and reported abdominal discomfort. A second episode of loose stool was reported overnight; a sample of this stool was collected for rRT-PCR testing, along with additional respiratory specimens (nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal) and serum. The stool and both respiratory specimens later tested positive by rRT-PCR for 2019-nCoV, whereas the serum remained negative.

Treatment during this time was largely supportive. For symptom management, the patient received, as needed, antipyretic therapy consisting of 650 mg of acetaminophen every 4 hours and 600 mg of ibuprofen every 6 hours. He also received 600 mg of guaifenesin for his continued cough and approximately 6 liters of normal saline over the first 6 days of hospitalization.


A chest radiograph taken on hospital day 3 (illness day 7) was reported as showing no evidence of infiltrates or abnormalities (Figure 3). However, a second chest radiograph from the night of hospital day 5 (illness day 9) showed evidence of pneumonia in the lower lobe of the left lung (Figure 4). These radiographic findings coincided with a change in respiratory status starting on the evening of hospital day 5, when the patient‚Äôs oxygen saturation values as measured by pulse oximetry dropped to as low as 90% while he was breathing ambient air. On day 6, the patient was started on supplemental oxygen, delivered by nasal cannula at 2 liters per minute. Given the changing clinical presentation and concern about hospital-acquired pneumonia, treatment with vancomycin (a 1750-mg loading dose followed by 1 g administered intravenously every 8 hours) and cefepime (administered intravenously every 8 hours) was initiated.


On hospital day 6 (illness day 10), a fourth chest radiograph showed basilar streaky opacities in both lungs, a finding consistent with atypical pneumonia (Figure 5), and rales were noted in both lungs on auscultation. Given the radiographic findings, the decision to administer oxygen supplementation, the patient‚Äôs ongoing fevers, the persistent positive 2019-nCoV RNA at multiple sites, and published reports of the development of severe pneumonia3,4 at a period consistent with the development of radiographic pneumonia in this patient, clinicians pursued compassionate use of an investigational antiviral therapy. Treatment with intravenous remdesivir (a novel nucleotide analogue prodrug in development10,11) was initiated on the evening of day 7, and no adverse events were observed in association with the infusion. Vancomycin was discontinued on the evening of day 7, and cefepime was discontinued on the following day, after serial negative procalcitonin levels and negative nasal PCR testing for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus.

On hospital day 8 (illness day 12), the patient‚Äôs clinical condition improved. Supplemental oxygen was discontinued, and his oxygen saturation values improved to 94 to 96% while he was breathing ambient air. The previous bilateral lower-lobe rales were no longer present. His appetite improved, and he was asymptomatic aside from intermittent dry cough and rhinorrhea. 

As of January 30, 2020, the patient remains hospitalized. He is afebrile, and all symptoms have resolved with the exception of his cough, which is decreasing in severity."

The real manipulation is in their definition of Novel Coronavirus Pneumonia, as they're calling it, that counts the number of people that contracted pneumonia(or at least show signs of it) from nCoV instead of the people that have contracted the virus. They will never have the virus numbers and if you look to the cases outside of China, you will find that the percentage of people who contract pneumonia from the virus is relatively low.

What I'm saying is that an astronomically large number of people contracted this virus in Wuhan, because the government took no precautions and instituted no quarantine at hospitals until mid january. A small percentage of people that required hospitalization of that astronomically large number of infected people instantly overwhelmed the 100 or so ICU beds that Wuhan had before this started.

Obviously, this is speculative to some degree, the numbers from outside of China are inconsistent with what we see happening in Wuhan."

These numbers have been tossed around by other redditors and a FEW independent researchers / doctors / pathologists. Some is speculation, some is based on leaked from inside China, some is data tracking / simulation and analysis on the pathologists' end.

TL;DR, I (and others) estimate that the # of infected could be anywhere from 150,000 to 250,000, with the # of deceased anywhere from 20,000 to 45,000.

There one given that we can be pretty sure of, being that China is lying about their numbers.

We all know China has been spraying the air and surfaces with a ""disinfectant"", for lack of a better term. We all know that they've been sending people to mass quarantine camps because they cant tend to the massive amount of people seeking treatment. Theres been pictures of the hospitals that they've built, looking very similar to the hospital ""layout"" of the hospitals during the Spanish Flu. And by layout, I mean rows upon rows of beds in one giant building with one giant room. Theres also been rumors / leaks that China has been cremating bodies, easily over 100+ a day. Not to mention that infected people are starting to be dragged out of their homes, or blockaded into their homes by citizens or the government. Just recently, the virus has already killed more people than SARS with the OFFICIAL death toll rising to 814. And that's only barely over a month since the outbreak OFFICIALLY started, although there are again rumors or leaks that this outbreak started in November, and was only leaked out by that whistleblower doctor in January, who was ""killed by the Coronavirus"", although I believe that the CCP killed him and covered it up.

The thing is, you have to realize how the health system in China works. For example, if someone shows up to the hospital with CoV and a heart disease, and then dies of a heart attack, the hospital will record that death as being due to his heart condition, and therefore will not count towards the death toll of the virus, even if the virus triggered his heart disease to worsen or was the cause of the fatal heart attack.

Taking everything into account, we can safely estimate that the death toll is more than 10 times the report made by the Chinese. This could bring the infection numbers to anywhere between 150k and 250k, with death tolls being anywhere from 20k to 45k, or even 60k if the infection numbers are on the VERY high end. It's hard to pin down exactly how large the numbers are, given that we (everyone outside of China) dont really know just how infectious or lethal this virus REALLY is. But it's safe to assume it's more infectious and lethal than both the Modern Flu and POSSIBLY the Spanish Flu. Only time will tell if it really is that bad. But with the current state of China and how many provinces and people are locked down, it isnt looking good."

My take is that it's a crossbreed of SARS cultivated in Wuhan Virology but leaked out by accident, as SARS did multiple times.  The research Wuhan was doing on bat coronavirus was [widely published](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-017-07766-9) and seemed benign, but the results of failed containment are definitely nasty.

If possible, when you come over would you mind practicing the ritual of laying on of hands? That might help.  I remember back when Gary could still talk he told me many times that ""deep tongue kisses are good for what ails ya,"" so if possible, maybe a bit of that too before you go. Of course, as you already know, those are also best practices for spreading Gary's Love, so you'll want to make sure to make them part of your standard ritual when you go on your mission to spread Gary's Love around the world. Some cultures find it a bit too intimate, so, just like Gary does, it's best to sneak up on them from behind, tackle them to the ground, and then french kiss them and rub their bodies all over with your hands--and other body parts, as necessary. Of course, Gary is well practiced enough to handle the whole ritual by himself.  But nobody expects you guys to perform to Gary's standards--I guess that's why you are going in groups of four?

Also, don't forget Antarctica, Madagascar, and the Polynesian islands--in fact, make sure to visit all the islands. What with this coronavirus pandemic, it's extra important to spread Gary's Love as far and wide as you can."

Since it's first reported case on December 1st, 2019, the virus has heavily affected everyday life in China as well as imports and exports coming in and out of the country.
As a result of China's manufacturing taking a hit, a number of products that were originally meant to be delivered worldwide have been halted or delayed. This has affected a number of industries, including the tech, toy, and gaming industries, delaying product construction and¬†events like Taipei Game Show¬†that were meant to be showcase new products.
So, let's take a look at how exactly this recent epidemic has affected the gaming industry and how it might continue to alter the plans of developers and tech giants like Sony and Microsoft. With¬†doctors on China's front line¬†to contain the spread of the virus and tend to those afflicted, these effects will hopefully end soon, as will the suffering of the victims.

It's astounding how many people are oblivious to the fact that collapse has happened before and \*has\* to happen again. Even Muse knows that endless growth is unsustainable. And it sure as hell looks like collapse is in the process right now. The only question is how long it will take - do we have decades or months? I'm in the process of stocking up on food. I'm not scared of the coronavirus or the death of American democracy or the rise of fascism. I am scared of climate change, but the biggest thing that will end \*my\* way of life will be the massive economic collapse that will be caused by one or two or all of the other major issues that are happening \*all at once\*. If supply chains collapse, it's game over for most people.

People look at historical collapses and seem to say 'but see, we're still here', like it's no big deal, but they fail to realise that in the process individuals suffer and die, and it's very likely they will be one of those individuals. Even under the best of circumstances the fall of historical empires took humanity centuries (hell a millenia) to recover from, and we have now used up so many of our natural resources that it's entirely possible that there will never again be a civilisation as advanced as we are right now. They fail to realise that the greater the quality of life we have now, the further we have to fall. Sure humans might survive as scavengers or in isolated communities, we probably won't go completely extinct, at least not for a few more centuries, but who wants to go from Netflix and grocery stores to eating whatever animals and old cans of dog food we can find?

2020-02-09,heilich,Coronavirus,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/f1bqaq/about_the_math_of_the_2_mortality_rate/fh3o616/,"Ah, the daily thread about mortality rate.

Let's take a look at the current numbers: 

#Cases

[As of Feb 9, 2020] (https://gisanddata.maps.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html#/bda7594740fd40299423467b48e9ecf6) we have total 37583 confirmed cases:

* 814 deaths
* 2848 recovered
* 33921 unresolved 

From this we can calculate, that *out of the resolved cases*:

    (814 deaths) / (3662 total resolved) = 22% died and 78% recovered

We have to keep in mind that it takes longer for person to recover than to die from the illness, and hospitals do tests only for the most severely ill ones, so the above calculation isn't a good representation of the actual chances of dying of this flu.

#World Health Organization

The only number given out by World Health Organization (WHO) so far has been a case fatality rate (CFR), which is the number of deaths divided by total confirmed cases. 

    (814 deaths) / (37583 confirmed cases) = 2% case fatality rate

While this is the correct way to calculate case fatality rate, this number doesn't give accurate estimation of the actual mortality rate of the flu, because it is an ongoing situation where majority of the confirmed cases are still unresolved. We don't have the information of whether the unresolved cases end up recovering or dying.

WHO themselves mentioned in the same [press conference](https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/media-resources/press-briefings#): ""*The only number currently known is how many people have died out of those who have been reported to the WHO...it is therefore very early to make any conclusive statements about what the overall mortality rate will be*"".

#The Lancet Study

https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(20)30211-7/fulltext

A study published in The Lancet tracked 99 confirmed cases from Wuhan Jinyintan Hospital. Death rate in that study was **11%**. We have to keep in mind that people in this study were not young an healthy to begin with.

#The Jama Network Study

https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2761044

The JAMA Network study, released in February 7 looked at 138 cases of hospitalized patients at Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University in Wuhan, China. In this study, mortality rate was **4.3%**. 

#Reported Numbers vs Reality

The reported numbers only include those who have been tested positive for the virus. A lot of the actual infections will go undiagnosed because China has reached their maximum capacity to test. Hospitals don't have enough test kits to test everyone. Also, majority of people with symptoms will choose to stay at home instead of going to the overcrowded hospitals where infected are gathered and spreading the virus around.  There have even been cases where people were tested positive for the virus and had no symptoms at all, so we really have no idea of the true number of infected people. However, we can safely assume that total number of infected is much much more than the reported confirmed cases.

There's also the very likely possibility that even the reported numbers are inaccurate, as China's officials could be reporting much lower numbers (of both infected and dead) for various political and economic reasons. 

Even if the true number of deaths would be a lot higher than reported, which is likely is because undiagnosed patients are not included in the statistics of the virus, the actual number of infected could easily be higher than 500 000 which means the mortality rate is still low. It's very unlikely that mortality rate of this illness ends up being higher than **5%**.

#Comparison

For comparison, the case fatality rate of similar viruses and seasonal flu: 

* SARS (**11%**)
* MERS (**35%**)
* Seasonal Flu (**less than 0.08%.**)"

I think the problem is that anti-Chinese government fake news efforts like the one described here ‚Äî https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/janelytvynenko/a-site-tied-to-steve-bannon-is-writing-fake-news-about-the ‚Äî make it really hard to figure out what the worst true horror stories. 

Example: If the Chinese government is really preparing to let people with mild cases of the coronavirus die in prison camps, I‚Äôd love to
support efforts to stop that. That would be horrible. If nothing else, at least give the people in those tents heat and nice blankets. 

But it looks as if all of the ‚Äúdeath hospital‚Äù stories and social media posts are based on one video that‚Äôs being spammed out in an organized way by people who hate the Chinese government. 

The Chinese government feeds that with the social media crackdown. Because it‚Äôs hard to find credible independent accounts, that makes it seem more reasonable to believe the one much-spammed video from
Wuhan. 

But, even if that video was sincere and honest and really shows a coronavirus field hospital, who knows if that video gave a complete picture of what‚Äôs going on. Maybe the field hospital just had a bad first day and now it‚Äôs full of fluffy quilts, big TVs and buffet tables. 

But, anyhow, my feeling is that troll spam has also cast doubt on a lot of the fainting videos and any analysis with the word ‚Äúcrematoria‚Äù in it. 

Maybe Wuhan is full of crematoria burning bodies 24/7, but crematoria is such a powerful clickbait word. I think that the body burning analysis based on the SO2 map is probably legit but that a lot of the other body burning posts are just meant to make Americans freak out and support isolationism."

41/136 patients example, refers to a study in China where the 41 were people who got infected in the hospital. Majority of those were healthcare workers. It didn‚Äôt confirm faecal transmission, whoever said hat is mistaken. This particular study is the recent JAMA study. You‚Äôll find it if you search that here on reddit or in google

The first case in USA did have his faecal matter test positive for coronavirus. But there wasn‚Äôt a reported transmission that way, they just said it‚Äôs likely this means it‚Äôs possible. You‚Äôll be able to search basic relate words to find that.

It was confirmed yesterday in China that the virus can become aerosolized and spread that way. This refers to droplets of mucous, fecal matter etc becoming suspended in the air, staying around for longer periods, and also travelling distances, in a way that is similar to airborne transmission.

But as far as I am aware, there a no confirmed published cases of this for coronavirus yet (we can assume that if they have confirmed it, they know of examples though). Hence why I pointed you in the direction of the SARS examples, so you can get an idea of how this behaves, while we wait for the published case literature in coronavirus to catch up"

I think the best thing at this point is to get prepared as you can, but not in a 'storm the stores, get in a fistfight with an old lady over the last package of ramen' sort of way. The CDC lays out a number of basic personal preparedness steps on their site: [https://www.cdc.gov/cpr/prepareyourhealth/PersonalHealth.htm](https://www.cdc.gov/cpr/prepareyourhealth/PersonalHealth.htm)

And they have a great one on pandemic flu they released which has a lot of relevance for 2019 n-Cov: [https://www.cdc.gov/nonpharmaceutical-interventions/pdf/gr-pan-flu-ind-house.pdf](https://www.cdc.gov/nonpharmaceutical-interventions/pdf/gr-pan-flu-ind-house.pdf)

Frankly speaking, a lot of this preparation is just smart and applies to a range of other natural disasters, which we should be preparing for anyway. I was preparing for another natural disaster (wildfires) and ended up with a bunch of N95 masks on hand for wildfire smoke, which are now really relevant now for 2019 n-Cov.

Good personal preparedness is just smart, and I think I'm going to take this time as a little wake-up call to think about the biological disasters we could face."

Then there's the thing with some Chinese not caring about the spreading, someone in the comments in this thread said there's a video out there with a woman literally spreading her mucus with her hand, in the buttons of an elevator, after sneezing. I can't vouch for the veracity of that one, but [I can for the one where a baby is trampled by cars while people see and don't bat an eye at all.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7RcCJhN9Yo) 

It makes me sick how little respect they have there for the welfare of others. Of course, if any of the passengers touched the baby, they would have gone to jail. The government created that culture there, and now if the infection goes out of hand, the world will paid for it.

You just wrote ""the government will never know better than people on human rights."", but that one video with the poor baby made me realize that some times you just can't count on people to be nice and listen.

Influenzas, including Swine Flu, etc etc. are all fast mutators and undergo antigenic drift, which eludes immunity: basically the receptors it binds to and the specific proteins those viruses connect with change over time.

SARS (and 2019-nCoV) are not like that.

>The genome of the novel coronavirus consists of a single strand of RNA. Microbes with that kind of genome mutate ‚Äúnotoriously quickly,‚Äù said biologist Michael Farzan of Scripps Research, who in 2005 was part of the team that identified the structure of the ‚Äúspike protein‚Äù by which SARS enters human cells.

>But SARS has a molecular proofreading system that reduces its mutation rate, and the new coronavirus‚Äôs similarity to SARS at the genomic level suggests it does, too. ‚ÄúThat makes the mutation rate much, much lower than for flu or HIV,‚Äù Farzan said. That lowers the chance that the virus will evolve in some catastrophic way to, say, become significantly more lethal.

Mutation rate is highly correlated with the most widespread respiratory viruses.

Different outbreaks have different virus reservoirs.  SARS had such a high transmissibility value because it is thought to originated from a single point (as 2019-nCoV has done.)  **Influenzas, especially those from birds, or domesticated animals, have lower R^0 s because there are multiple origins which are competing to infect the same pool of people.**  Common seasonal Influenzas really never go away.  There are always some cases, somewhere in the world.  Wild birds are also a common reservoir for a number of influenza strains."

So tomorrow will be 5 days from when I first started following that scientists comments you gave the link for.

These are numbers that have been provided online: 

date	 reported cases 	 critical cases 	 deceased 	 recovered 

6/02/2020	 28,349 	 3,863 	 565 	 1,387.00 

and projected for tomorrow night:

11/02/2020	 56,698 	7,726	 1,130 	 2,774.00 

However we already have from here  [https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/](https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/)   
 

# Coronavirus Cases:

**40,553** of which **6,494**  
in **serious/critical condition**

# Deaths:

**910**

# Recovered:

**3,324** 

&#x200B;

So the infection rate might make it by tomorrow night and critical might also make the projected figures but deaths look like they are down and recovery is already passed the projected figures for tomorrow night.

And since we know that Wuhan just has some people (sick enough not to be at home) just in a large auditorium then they will get limited care and I suspect it is just triage.

Unless China is micromanaging these numbers then according to that scientists tomorrows numbers being 10x more should be  
  

 reported 	 critical 	 deceased 	 recovered 

 566,980 	 77,260 	 11,300 	 27,740   

I am getting more confidence in the Chinese numbers because with that number of recovered if it is 10x worse then why would they need to start welding people into their apartments?

I think China has assessed the risk and been extremely tough in order to manage this."

Half of all antibiotics in the U.S. are indiscriminately dumped into pig and chicken feed as ""growth promoters"" because the animals grow faster from not having to fight off infections, which is why industrial-scale farms are a breeding ground for resistant bacteria.

HONG KONG¬†-- My dad looked disappointed when I arrived back from Hong Kong to spend the Lunar New Year holidays with family in the eastern Chinese city of Qingdao.

This year, my suitcase wasn't packed with chocolates, fine wines and premium Chungwha cigarettes. In their place were dozens of N95 masks and vitamin C supplements.

I arrived home on Jan. 23, two days before the Lunar New Year, a time when millions of Chinese families gather together. On that day, the city of Wuhan -- the epicenter of the new coronavirus -- was locked down in an attempt to prevent the spread of the disease. Five million people left the city before it was quarantined, and experts warned of dire consequences as human-to-human transmission was confirmed.

In Qingdao, a coastal city of 9 million that is more than 1,000 km from Wuhan, people were remarkably calm. Few wore masks on the streets, and wet markets were crowded with housewives hunting for fresh food to prepare for the year-end banquet.

But two days later, everything changed. People in my neighborhood woke up to the news that a man who returned from Wuhan spent two hours on the Qingdao subway, using four different lines, before showing symptoms of the virus. The number of deaths nationwide jumped to 41, with more than 1,000 cases."

You are also the one making the stretch stating it is ‚Äúairborne‚Äù when the paper itself said ‚Äúaerosolized‚Äù. The principle stands that size and survivability dictate how far and if something spreads. It is very possible it is airborne in the traditional sense, given its small size (I.e, 120 nm), but I will wait for a clear consensus before sharing that sort of knowledge.  

It also logically stands that far more people have the virus than are dying from the virus (i.e., it is only a 2% mortality rate). If we aren‚Äôt able to test those dying, imagine how many we must be missing that are living. We are also far more likely to test individuals who are sick upon presentation vs. those who are not. Let‚Äôs assume you work in a Chinese hospital and 100 pts present with coronavirus. 20 may be sick, 2 will die, and 80 will have an upper respiratory infection. You have 20 tests to confirm the illness. Which are you testing? The bias is likely in favor of mortality. 

Given that it presents like a URI also, there are potentially hundreds who aren‚Äôt even coming to the hospital to begin with. People are being quarantined at home because they don‚Äôt need critical care. Physicians could have been indiscriminately testing everyone and not those most ill. That may have created a falsely low mortality, but then we would be hearing about suspected nCOV mortality. 

I can fathom the alternative where the bias points towards survivability. 10000 pts present, 200 will die, 2000 are sick, and 8000 have a URI. You only have 20 tests to use. The mortality would be falsely low as you are missing sooo many cases (that is if we don‚Äôt assume physician selection bias for testing, as above, and a Govt cover up of suspected mortality in the non-tested(okay, maybe)). I don‚Äôt believe the mortality data gathered to date expresses this level of concern though. Correct me if I am wrong.

1.  Swine flu actually started in Mexico, not the United States. And you bet your ass we called it Mexican swine flu all day and all night. So if we called this Chinese flu, that that would be well within precedent.  However, everyone I hear talk about it calls it coronavirus, not Chinese flu.

2.  A big difference between swine flu and the current virus is that swine flu was not contagious until after it became symptomatic.  It was very easy to set up an effective barrier at the border by measuring temperatures when people got off planes or arrived by car or by boat.  During swine flu, I went back-and-forth several times to Mexico, Argentina, and Brazil. Every step of the way my temperature was measured to thermal cameras and forehead scans. Anyone who is found have a fever was put on wheelchair and wheeled away.  The reason for all the travel bans is because it‚Äôs not possible to do that with this new virus. It spreads without symptoms, therefore it‚Äôs impossible to be sure that you‚Äôre not letting someone sick into the country.

3.  Even if something was done incorrectly at the time of swine flu, that doesn‚Äôt mean that that‚Äôs a good excuse to do it now."

Zerohedge got banned from Twitter for posting that HIV discovery, and it turned out to be true. They were the first or one of of the first to report on the crematoriums running 24/7 and how China was hiding the body count by limiting the test kits, and people were just being diagnosed with 'viral pneumonia'  this was 2 weeks ago. 

Here's how I did research and got ridiculed. I posted this same zerohedge article first on an uncensored wu-flu subreddit, along with first hand account screenshots confirming exactly what was in the article, different families claiming there relatives had the virus but couldn't be tested or bet help, told they more likely had it tho, they died and cause of death was 'viral pneumonia' and they were taken immediately to crematorium, burned and not tested.

Now, I found these two things seperate from each other, and one clearly confirmed the other, that's what type of research I'm doing, I'm connecting the dots. Aftergg-ghgy posting this and telling people this for the last 2 weeks I had multiple people tell me my source wasnt reliable, that it wasn't that bad, I was just a conspiracy theorist, im taking this whole coronavirus thing to far, Yada Yada Yada and it all turned out to be true, that's research, learning about shit when it comes out and finding evidence to back it up until finally the 'reliable' media sources comes out claiming it to be factual. And this has been happening since this thing kicked off 3 weeks ago, articles coming out saying this or that is happening, people denying it vehemently, others trying to find more information via videos and chat logs finally and 'reliable' media conforming it days to weeks later.

So wake up, a lot of real information is coming out of these 'unreliable' sources that is true and the real 'unreliable' sources are the ones who originally deny only to have to go back on their word. Everything ive been telling everyone about this virus is coming true, if only they had listened to us 3 weeks ago when were all crazies and getting banned left and right from r/China_flu"
2020-02-09,AmbitiousPrompt,france,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/france/comments/f0pf9z/le_minist√®re_de_la_sant√©_annonce_cinq_nouveaux/fh1y5i9/,"> 96% des d√©c√®s sont dans la r√©gion de Hubei 

J'ai aussi remarqu√© la disparit√© entre la r√©partition des d√©c√®s et des gu√©ris qui peut s'expliquer par le fait que les gens ont √©t√© infect√©s dans l'√©picentre √† Hubei et que ceux qui √©taient suffisamment costauds pour encore se d√©placer sont rentrer chez eux pour finir leur convalescence √† la maison (biais du survivant). D'o√π √©galement un tassement des morts √† Hubei. Tout d√©pend de comment les stats ont √©t√© r√©cup√©r√©es. 
J'ai bien pr√©cis√© que les 23% n'√©tait pas aussi l'indicateur que l'on recherche ultimement, on peut supposer que le nombre de gu√©ris est sous-estim√©.

> une pression m√©dicale tr√®s importante ce qui peut donner un chiffre de mortalit√© bien plus √©lev√© qu'en conditions normales ou optimales.

J'en doute. Pas de traitement sp√©cifique √† l'h√¥pital (c'est doliprane pour soulager les sympt√¥mes + perfusion pour les garder hydrater), donc √ßa joue peu. Et si √ßa jouait beaucoup, on est nous aussi pas √† l'abri d'une surcharge hospitali√®re (surtout qu'on est dans la p√©riode gr√®ve etc) si le virus venait √† se propager.

> De m√©moire, les 2% repris partout dans la presse sont le r√©sultat de l'observation de 80 patients, dans les premiers jours de l'√©pid√©mie, avec un √¢ge moyen √©lev√© et pour des cas qui ont n√©cessit√© une hospitalisation.

Y'a s√ªrement des gens pour qui √ßa a pas √©t√© pire qu'une grippe normale, tout comme il y'a possiblement des gens qui sont morts chez eux sans que personne ne le sache encore (autorit√©s d√©bord√©s, les gens qui vivent seuls √† la campagne o√π le syst√®me hospitalier est inexistant ... ). Et on parle √©galement d'une possibilit√© que les cas confirm√©s (et donc gu√©ris) ne le soient pas finalement parce que les tests utilis√©s par les chinois sont sensibles √† d'autres virus et qu'il y'a potentiellement des faux positifs (du genre j'ai tel coronavirus qui est b√©nin mais je suis test√© positif pour le ncov2019 et je fausse donc les stats des gu√©ris)

> En dehors de Hubei, les chiffres s'√©croulent.

Les cas report√©s √† l'√©tranger ont surtout commenc√© vers fin janvier (en commen√ßant par la France), √ßa pourrait √™tre bien trop t√¥t pour d√©terminer l'issue des patients (on parle d'une possible p√©riode d'incubation possiblement asymptomatique allant jusqu'√† 14 jours). D'ailleurs si je me souviens bien une des 6 personnes originellement infect√©es est en r√©animation. Oui il est √¢g√©, mais je rappelle que 20% de notre population a plus de 65 ans et je parle pas du nombre gens jeunes mais d√©j√† affaiblis par d'autres conditions m√©dicales qui sont du coup √† risque. 


> Techniquement, il faudrait comparer les gu√©ris d'aujourd'hui aux morts d'il y'a 10 jours.

√áa serait supposer que la maladie progresse √† la m√™me vitesse pour tout le monde et que le d√©lai entre le pic des sympt√¥mes et la gu√©rison est de 10 jours. Un choix compl√®tement arbitraire.

Et je parle m√™me pas du fait que le PCC a plus int√©r√™t √† mettre en exergue le nombre de gu√©ris et √† sousjouer le nombre de d√©c√®s. 


Bref, il est fort probable que nous ne sommes qu'au d√©but du truc et qu'en ne connaissant pas bien le virus on biaise la fa√ßon d'interpr√©ter les donn√©es. Le fait est qu'en p√©riode de crise, il vaut mieux pr√©voir pour le pire plut√¥t que d'esp√©rer pour le mieux (et c'est ce que font tous ceux qui disent 2% blabla, y'a que les vieux qui clamsent, comme √ßa au moins √ßa r√®gle le probl√®me de la retraite blabla).

There are several hundred million people who were born as a second child when it was illegal, or who have no official identities. It's actually a very common problem. 

However, back under chairman mao's rule, population statistics were pretty accurate because there were no such rules. There was no one-child policy. He was actively encouraging more children. 

Also, I don't believe China is ""lying"" on the official statistics. They have, in fact, only confirmed that many cases, because that's all the test kits they have. But there are tons more ""suspected cases"" who have died. They can't be marked as coronavirus deaths because they were not confirmed cases. While this is misleading, it's not an active lie.

The paper isn't a study of how or why people have sexual preferences for certain features. 

>2. Do you know a majority of black men? Have you seen all black men? 

I live in Harlem, and have lived throughout the US. I am black myself. I know that most racial groups share some facial features. Stop pretending like there's a significant number of sub Saharan blacks who look non-african. 

>3. No shit Sherlock lol. I‚Äôm not denying that people of the same race have a lot of common features

So what your point ?

>But to posit that we look alike just because we‚Äôre both black is honestly absurd.

We look alike through common shared features. No one is suggesting we'd look like brothers or twins.

>5. This is not true. For one, please realize that ‚Äúethnic groups‚Äù are different from ‚Äúracial groups‚Äù.

Ethnic groups can form a racial group

>The former is related to nations whereas the latter is connected to societally-created racial structures

Ethnicity has multiple meanings, one that also is defined by ancestry. 

>Does your typical Nigerian look like your typical Ethiopian?

No. They're not even in the same racial group. Egyptians are either North African, Arab, or mixed. Nigerians are sub-saharan african, and do have different ethnic groups. Does not mean sub Saharan Africans do not share some similar physical features, but you act as if there are ethnic Nigerians that look asian, or white. 

>They have some common features, but there are also differences that they might share with other racial groups. 

Chances are, most of them share similar features to their own racial group than others. 

>6. Having a low population of a certain racial group in an area often leads to people in that area being less attracted to that group of people, likely due to lack of exposure.

Is that a provable claim? Or your own opinion ? 

I've met several Russian men who were attracted to me, and we all know black populations in Russia are tiny. 

>7. How is it that someone who is defending Asian people against racist Coronavirus comments doesn‚Äôt understand the complexity of racism?

How can someone who believes that sexuality is diverse and uncontrollable by people not understand that some people aren't attracted to certain features ? OP even elaborated and stated that he does have attraction to some black guys, but it's rare. 

I've seen non-black people get berated for stating they do not find black features attractive, but practically hear nothing when black people say the same thing about non-black people."

However in terms of lethality, it is way, WAY behind. SARS lethality is around 10%, Ebola is around 70%. Coronavirus is 2% so far and as transmission spreads and more survive that number will continue to shrink.

It's like any other flu, any virus COULD become a pandemic with piss poor infection control.

Until there is the prerequisite amount of infected in the UK to make transmission on that scale viable (which we would know about by now for sure), we really have very little to worry about."

If the article only had that excerpt, then yeah, it would be an example of crazy and heavily biased reporting. But guess what? You completely ignored the long lines of evidence the author had to substantiate her claim. You also ignored the huge lengths the author goes to in describing the current issues with Chinese traditional medicine.

For example, the author refers to a case-controlled study where survivors of SARS who received Traditional Chinese medicine had shorter hospital stays and required less steroid treatment. The author further discusses research that showed that the extracts of certain herbs used in CTM inhibited viral replication and protease activity of the SARS Coronavirus. *Nevertheless*, **the author  makes sure to say that despite this, CTM does not have a strong basis of clinical research, especially in treating the new coronavirus outbreak.**

This is the crazy thing. The author *repeatedly* stresses that the science on CTM is very poor. The author *repeatedly* stresses that there has been evidence of people being harmed by CTM. The author *repeatedly* stresses that there is a lack of regulation and almost nonexistent standardization in regards to CTM prescription. The author *repeatedly* quotes influential researchers and experts who doubt CTM's efficacy in treating the symptoms of the new coronavirus. But no, of course I agree with you that the article is ""fawning"" about using CTM to combat the novel coronavirus.

If anyone read the article, they would come out with this feeling on CTM: that it is on very shaky scientific footing, with various regulatory and advertising issues *but* that certain aspects of CTM could have some beneficial properties, in particular regarding the recent coronavirus outbreak. That is a perfectly logical conclusion to make, and anyone who reads through the article would feel that this is what the author's main argument is going for."

While I do not use TinyTinyRSS, it works the same as it's alternative, Miniflux, which I use. I use these RSS aggregators as my personal news hub. Instead of going to Reddit, a mainstream news site, etc. to consume the news, my server pulls the RSS feeds from websites I care about. When you pull a copy of the article you don't read it on the actual site, which means no ads, popups, or tracking! To read on mobile I use Reeder iOS app to have a nice experience [LINK](https://reederapp.com)

For some personal use cases, in my feed right now I have:

\- (Blog) [Feeding the Cloud](https://feeding.cloud.geek.nz) \- A cool technical blog about networking projects. The author post very rarely, so by using mainflux is will pull a copy of any new post into my server where I can see in my ""Unread"" feed. It's a great way to keep up to date with all my fav bloggers in one spot.

\- (Gov Institution) [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/media/rss-govd.html) \- With ongoing coronavirus outbreak happening now, I was curious to see/read the content that is coming out of the American institution responsible for analyzing and containing the outbreak. It's a bit too complicated to follow so I might not follow them for much longer, but I like having that direct option, where I get headlines directly from an institution.

\- (Social Media) Reddit - Reddit has instructions on how you can make an RSS feed that pull posts only from specific users. I use that to follow a bot user on reddit that posts daily Calvin and Hobbes comics. Those posts show up in my private feed and help me avoid reddit in general. I do  similar arrangements with Youtube channels that I really enjoy but want to avoid watching on the platform to avoid getting distracted by other content.

If have any questions feel free to ask.

I'm personally a fan of the 355 that I received recently. They have some unique and interesting filling mechanisms, like Vac Fillers, Bulk Fillers, and a new spring/bulk filler hybrid! They also have piston fillers and C/C pens as well. The best part IMO are the color options. Their acrylics are beautiful and have lots of depth depending on the color/pattern. Their shipping from the official Etsy page has been delayed until March (worst case scenario) due to the Coronavirus, but you may be able to find some at other online retailers or on Ebay."
