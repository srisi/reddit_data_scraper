Here's 3M's own thoughts on N95 masks/respirators: https://multimedia.3m.com/mws/media/604799O/ohes-h1n1-influenza-a-faq.pdf

>**Can respirators protect you from biological agents such as bacteria or viruses?** It is probable that H1N1 is spread from person to person in several ways. Therefore, a respirator is just one of several preventative measures that can be used to help reduce exposure  to  the  virus  that  causes  H1N1  influenza. Respirators are designed to reduce exposures  of  the  wearer  to  airborne  hazards. Biological  agents,  such  as  bacteria  or  viruses, are particles and can be filtered by particulate filters with the same efficiency as non-biological particles having the same physical characteristics (size, shape, etc.).  

Surgical masks at least help you stop touching your face, reduce risk of infecting others and aid against larger droplets."

I find the ban on bankruptcy proceedings quite intersting though. I have been thinking about how the economic impact of the coronavirus is what is, worryingly, driving the inadequate responses and policies of governments worldwide. What we need to do is simply shut the economy down temporarily. Close the stockmarkets, and pass legislation that temporarily prevents enforcing debts or money owed or bankruptcy proceedings.

Italy, Iran, and South Korea along with other countries exhibiting rapidly accelerating confirmed cases should enforce serious containment strategies if they do not want to end up like China from the past month.

**Edit:** To the comments below, *nowhere* in my comment did I *specifically* say that these countries should take as drastic measures as shutting down over half its population like China has to contain this.

What I was trying to suggest was that countries should be taking **serious, proactive steps** to mitigate the spread of this virus, whatever methods they may be, before it gets out of control."

CPAP and bipap will buy you time in many respiratory failures like asthma copd exacerbations, pulmonary edema and may spare intubations

In a severe pneumonia you will have no way of clearing mucus or suctioning your mucus out.  When you cough the positive pressure will just push it back.  

So no it's not a great option and i haven't seen many pneumonias do well if they need CPAP or bipap for more than 24 hours.  Inevitably they all get intubated. 

If it's a pure hypoxic issue I rather use high flow nasal cannula so you can clear your mucus.  Unfortunately for most the work of breathing is so tough that we have to move to mechanical ventilation

Edit: in ARDS early intubation, careful control of lung volumes, paralysis, and proning have led to better survival!  NIV has never helped in moderate to severe ARDS.  We can get a lot of patients out of this mess if we take control of the metabolic demand and amount of iatrogenic damage to the lungs. 

This is why I stress that we must control the infection rate.  We can't save a patient with a ventilator or ECMO if we re out of ventilators or ECMo"

 Dear Family and Friends, as some of you may recall, when I was a  professor of pathology at the University of California San Diego, I was  one of the first molecular virologists in the world to work on  coronaviruses (the 1970s). I was the first to demonstrate the number of  genes the virus contained. Since then, I have kept up with the  coronavirus field and its multiple clinical transfers into the human  population (e.g., SARS, MERS), from different animal sources.

The  current projections for its expansion in the US are only probable, due  to continued insufficient worldwide data, but it is most likely to be  widespread by mid to late March and April.

Here is what I have  done and the precautions that I take and will take. These are the same  precautions I currently use during our influenza seasons, except for the  mask and gloves.:

1) NO HANDSHAKING! Use a fist bump, slight bow, elbow bump, etc.

 2) Use ONLY your knuckle to touch light switches. elevator buttons,  etc.. Lift the gasoline dispenser with a paper towel or use a disposable  glove.

3) Open doors with your closed fist or hip - do not grasp  the handle with your hand, unless there is no other way to open the  door. Especially important on bathroom and post office/commercial doors.

4) Use disinfectant wipes at the stores when they are available, including wiping the handle and child seat in grocery carts.

 5) Wash your hands with soap for 10-20 seconds and/or use a greater  than 60% alcohol-based hand sanitizer whenever you return home from ANY  activity that involves locations where other people have been.

6)  Keep a bottle of sanitizer available at each of your home's entrances.  AND in your car for use after getting gas or touching other contaminated  objects when you can't immediately wash your hands.

7) If  possible, cough or sneeze into a disposable tissue and discard. Use your  elbow only if you have to. The clothing on your elbow will contain  infectious virus that can be passed on for up to a week or more!

What I have stocked in preparation for the pandemic spread to the US:

 1) Latex or nitrile latex disposable gloves for use when going  shopping, using the gasoline pump, and all other outside activity when  you come in contact with contaminated areas.

Note: This  virus is spread in large droplets by coughing and sneezing. This means  that the air will not infect you! BUT all the surfaces where these  droplets land are infectious for about a week on average - everything  that is associated with infected people will be contaminated and  potentially infectious. The virus is on surfaces and you will not be  infected unless your unprotected face is directly coughed or sneezed  upon. This virus only has cell receptors for lung cells (it only infects  your lungs). The only way for the virus to infect you is through your  nose or mouth via your hands or an infected cough or sneeze onto or into  your nose or mouth.

2) Stock up now with disposable surgical  masks and use them to prevent you from touching your nose and/or mouth  (We touch our nose/mouth 90X/day without knowing it!). This is the only  way this virus can infect you - it is lung-specific. The mask will not  prevent the virus in a direct sneeze from getting into your nose or  mouth - it is only to keep you from touching your nose or mouth.

 3) Stock up now with hand sanitizers and latex/nitrile gloves (get the  appropriate sizes for your family). The hand sanitizers must be  alcohol-based and greater than 60% alcohol to be effective.

4)  Stock up now with zinc lozenges. These lozenges have been proven to be  effective in blocking coronavirus (and most other viruses) from  multiplying in your throat and nasopharynx. Use as directed several  times each day when you begin to feel ANY ""cold-like"" symptoms  beginning. It is best to lie down and let the lozenge dissolve in the  back of your throat and nasopharynx. Cold-Eeze lozenges is one brand  available, but there are other brands available.

I, as many  others do, hope that this pandemic will be reasonably contained, BUT I  personally do not think it will be. Humans have never seen this  snake-associated virus before and have no internal defense against it.  Tremendous worldwide efforts are being made to understand the molecular  and clinical virology of this virus. Unbelievable molecular knowledge  about the genomics, structure, and virulence of this virus has already  been achieved. BUT, there will be NO drugs or vaccines available this  year to protect us or limit the infection within us. Only symptomatic  support is available.

I hope these personal thoughts will be helpful during this potentially catastrophic pandemic. Good luck to all of us,

James Robb, MD FCAP"

Just a few minutes ago, they let one of their friends whose kid is selling girl scout cookies come into our place. The friend was coughing up a storm everywhere. Once everyone left the house, I had to wait for a bit, open all the doors and windows, turn on a giant fan, and clean everything.

If there is disease that threatens that system in your body, you take that shit seriously!!! 
It is god damn time that we pre preemptively prepare for this virus. I call for the cancellation of schools, all non-essential international and domestic flights, work from home orders, and cancellation of events.

I’ve had tons of students sick with a respiratory illness the past week or two. I teach in the district right next to Lake Oswego, the location of the local spread in Oregon."

After a few days you go home with some medicine and rest with a nice bowl of soup. 

In that possible and short story you just needed the services of: oil refiners, truck drivers to deliver the oil, doctors, nurses, respiratory therapist, cleaning staff, maintenance staff to keep the ventilator running, the truck that delivers medical supplies to the hospital, the people in the hospital warehouse that packed the truck, other hospital staff, police, fire, EMS, pharmacist and pharm tech to fill your prescription, cashier to check you out, grocery store worker to sell you the soup, truck driver to delivery the food to the store, stock clerk, and manager. That is at least 17 jobs that have to be filled for you to go to the hospital, get treatment, get medicine, get food and return home.

These folks see estimates of R0=2.5 and CFR=1% as basically no big deal. (note: I realize these are conservative values.) While recognizing we have an incomplete understanding of the COVID-19 virus, to me those are two numbers are a nightmare from a public health standpoint. And we have some reason to believe they are on the low end. R0 based on mutation rates and early China spreading suggest it could be as high as 4.0+ and the new sampling data from China strongly supports the number of undiagnosed asymptomatic carriers as being not 10x the number of symptomatic people but rather more like 1x. I don't know man. I really wish the US was first out the door with a PCR test and sampling widely in all the major mets by Feb 1. That's what I expected -- that's not what happened.

2020-03-01,skeebidybop,Coronavirus,7,https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/fc3w3i/cdc_lab_for_coronavirus_test_kits_may_have_been/fj8dc32/,"Full text from this Axios article, which is a reputable source of journalism:

>A top federal scientist sounded the alarm about what he feared was contamination in an Atlanta lab where the government made test kits for the coronavirus, according to sources familiar with the situation in Atlanta.

>The Trump administration has ordered an independent investigation of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention lab, and manufacturing of the virus test kits has been moved, the sources said.

>**Why it matters**: At the time the administration is under scrutiny for its early preparations for the virus, the potential problems at the lab became a top internal priority for some officials. But the Trump administration did not talk publicly about the Food and Drug Administration’s specific concerns about the Atlanta lab.

>Senior officials are still not saying exactly what the FDA regulator found at the Atlanta lab.
The CDC lab in Atlanta developed the testing formula for the coronavirus test — which the government says works — and was manufacturing relatively small amounts of testing kits for laboratories around the country. This is where the lab ran into problems, per sources familiar with the situation.

>FDA Commissioner Stephen Hahn said, in a statement to Axios, that government agencies have already worked together to resolve the problems with the coronavirus tests.
“Upon learning about the test issue from CDC, FDA worked with CDC to determine that problems with certain test components were due to a manufacturing issue,” he said. “We worked hand in hand with CDC to resolve the issues with manufacturing. FDA has confidence in the design and current manufacturing of the test that already have and are continuing to be distributed. These tests have passed extensive quality control procedures and will provide the high-level of diagnostic accuracy we need during this coronavirus outbreak.”

>**The big picture**: The FDA says it now has full confidence in the coronavirus diagnostic kit, but a slew of new cases announced over the weekend suggest the virus has spread throughout the country while the U.S. government tested only a narrow subset of the population for it.

>The U.S. government had admitted to problems with its diagnostic tests — which have put the U.S. well behind China and South Korea in doing large-scale testing of the American public for the coronavirus.
The big question: It was not immediately clear if or how possible contamination in the Atlanta lab played a role in delays or problems with testing. Nor was it clear how significant or systemic the contamination concerns may be; whether it was a one-time issue that’s easily resolved, or a broader concern involving protocols, safeguards or leadership.
Behind the scenes: The FDA official who visited the Atlanta lab, Timothy Stenzel, is the director of the Office of In Vitro Diagnostics and Radiological Health.

>About a week ago, when the Secretary of Health and Human Services Alex Azar was under extreme pressure over the delays in getting coronavirus testing kits to market, Stenzel traveled to Atlanta to help troubleshoot whatever technical problems might have been occurring with the tests.

>Stenzel was alarmed by the procedures he witnessed in the Atlanta laboratory and raised concerns with multiple CDC officials, per a source familiar with the situation in Atlanta.
Stenzel is a highly-regarded scientist and diagnostics expert. He was on the ground in Atlanta to deal with technical issues and happened to stumble upon the inappropriate procedures and possible contaminants. He is not a laboratory inspector and thus was not charged with producing an inspection report on the lab conditions.

>But he raised the concerns and they have been taken seriously and risen to the highest levels of the U.S. government.

>On Thursday afternoon, the concerns about the Atlanta laboratory were raised in a conference call that included senior government officials from multiple agencies including the Department of Health and Human Services, the Food and Drug Administration, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and the National Institutes of Health.

>The call’s purpose was to figure out ways to mass produce the testing kits and get them to market quickly.

>The Trump administration says it’s now figured out how to get over those hurdles. An HHS spokesperson promised that by the end of this week, “we will have the capacity to test up to 75,000 individuals” for the coronavirus

>**What's next**: The FDA’s manufacturing concerns — which include the possible contamination of testing kits — have also resulted in the Trump administration ordering an independent investigation of the CDC’s Atlanta laboratory, according to senior officials.

>“HHS has launched an investigation and is assembling a team of non-CDC scientists to better understand the nature and source of the manufacturing defect in the first batch of COVID-19 test kits that were distributed to state health departments and others,” said an HHS spokesperson.

>“HHS/CDC have been transparent with the American people regarding the issue with the manufacturing of the diagnostic and will be transparent with the findings of this investigation.” (But the administration was not transparent about the senior FDA official's concerns about the conditions and procedures in the Atlanta laboratory.)

>A senior administration official added that the government also moved the manufacturing of the coronavirus tests out of the Atlanta laboratory of CDC.

>The official said that the CDC engaged with a third party contractor on Feb. 20 to help manufacture the testing kits. The official added that the FDA regulator, Stenzel, visited the Atlanta laboratory on Feb. 22.

>**Between the lines**: Until Thursday, the CDC’s guidance was to only test Americans for the coronavirus if they’d recently traveled to China — or had close contact with someone known to have the virus — and were symptomatic.

>Under this policy, the CDC initially refused to test a California patient who didn’t fit this criteria but had the coronavirus, although the CDC disputes that it denied doctors’ testing request.

>As of Friday, South Korea had tested 65,000 people for the coronavirus; the U.S. had tested only 459, per Science Magazine. China can reportedly conduct up to 1.6 million tests a week.

>Although the World Health Organization has sent testing kits to 57 other countries, the U.S. decided to make its own.

>There have also been problems with the tests themselves. On Feb. 12, the FDA announced that health labs across the country were having problems validating the CDC's diagnostic test, Science reports in an in-depth account of what went wrong with the tests.

>The FDA announced yesterday that public health labs can create their own diagnostic test. Scott Becker, the CEO of the Association of Public Health Laboratories, told Science that he expects that public health labs will be able to do 10,000 tests a day by the end of the week."

> Author Dean Koontz has been hailed throughout his long career for his works, which have included suspense thrillers, horror, science fiction and other genres.

> But recently, he has attracted attention — at least in some quarters — as a prophet.

> The Bedford County native, 74, who now lives in California, has climbed the list of most-searched topics on the internet, and been lighting up social media sites, after readers noted similarities — striking on the surface — between the plot of Koontz’s 1981 thriller “The Eyes of Darkness” and the coronavirus dubbed COVID-19 that appeared in China. The virus has spread across the globe, infecting more than 75,000 people in China, with more than 2,000 deaths attributed to the illness, which first came to the attention of the world in the city of Wuhan.

> Particularly eye-catching was this quote from the book:

> “They call the stuff “Wuhan-400” because it was developed at their RDNA labs outside of the city of Wuhan and it was the four-hundredth viable strain of man-made microorganisms created at that research centre.”

> Perhaps making the quote even more chilling is the real-life existence of a high-level bio-research lab, the Wuhan Institute of Virology.

> The eerie coincidence has taken flight worldwide.

> The issue was even raised by Sen Tom Cotton, R-Ark., who in an interview voiced the possibility that the virus had been manufactured by Chinese authorities.

> “Author Dean Koontz eerily predicted the coronavirus outbreak in his 1981 thriller ‘The Eyes of Darkness,’ ” a post on the Fox News website reads.

> Later, “the coincidence between the book’s virus and the actual coronavirus outbreak is uncanny.”

> Among media outlets doing stories or postings on “The Eyes of Darkness” similarities are The New York Times, Business Mirror, The Week, The Weather Channel, ABS-CBN and the Derry Journal (Northern Ireland). Interest seems particularly acute in India, where The New Indian Express, Times of India, One India, indiablooms and Nagaland Post have all addressed the topic.

> Comparisons between the book and the coronavirus outbreak have been rampant on social media sites.

> There is only one problem, of course: It’s all a coincidence.

> The internet site snopes.com notes that, “Dean Koontz did not predict an outbreak of a new coronavirus. Other than the name (Wuhan-400), this fictional biological weapon has little in common with the virus that caused an outbreak in 2020.”

> Among other significant disparities, snopes notes:

> • In Koontz’s novel, “Wuhan-400” is a human-made weapon. The coronavirus, on the other hand, was not.

> • In the novel, “Wuhan-400” has a 100% fatality rate. While researchers are still learning about the coronavirus, the current fatality rate sits at about 2%.

> • The fictional “Wuhan-400” has an extremely quick incubation period of about four hours, compared to COVID-19 which has an incubation period between two and 14 days.

> Indeed, snopes points out that in the original version, released by Koontz in 1981 under the pen name Leigh Nichols, the virus originates in Gorky, Russia, and is called Gorky 400. It is not until a 2008 re-release under Koontz’ own name that the virus’s origins are moved to Wuhan.

> One person who has not addressed the uproar over the coincidence is Koontz, who has been silent about the topic on his social media accounts.

> Attempts to reach him by telephone on Wednesday were not successful."

However, if youre going to wear it please disinfect the mask and change the filter regularly"
