South Korea s rate is 0.6, and they have done a phenomenal job of testing everyone that needs to be tested.

If you look at Wuhan, Iran and USA the rate is way, way higher, suggesting massive underreporting, due in part to inadequate testing . Given there are multiple cases of community transmission in the USA, there are probably thousands of cases already.  

Imperial College of London published a report a while back estimating the rate to be 0.8.  Believe it's report #4.

That being said, mortality is not the only measure that matters, to be sure, even 0.8 is many, many times higher than the flu.  Coronavirus is more contagious than the flu and greater % of coronavirus patients need medical attention than flu patients.  Death rate would obviously spike in the event that hospitals are overwhelmed. The 0.8 or 1 rate assumes everyone receives adequate care, that may not be the case if we don't improve our handling of this crisis."

2020-03-06,AdoptedPoster,Coronavirus,17,https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/feo622/maybe_i_have_a_natural_ability_president_plays/fjpaoxu/,"President Trump likes to say that he fell into politics almost by accident, and on Friday, as he sought to calm a nation gripped with fears over coronavirus, he suggested he would have thrived in another profession — medical expert.

“I like this stuff. I really get it,” Trump boasted to reporters during a tour of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta, where he met with actual doctors and scientists who are feverishly scrambling to contain and combat the deadly illness. Citing a “great, super-genius uncle” who taught at MIT, Trump professed that it must run in the family genes.

“People are really surprised I understand this stuff,” he said. “Every one of these doctors said, ‘How do you know so much about this?’ Maybe I have a natural ability.”

AD

But for members of the general public alarmed by more than 300 diagnosed cases in the United States — including at least 21 that his administration announced Friday were discovered on a cruise ship off the San Francisco coast — Trump’s performance during an impromptu 45-minute news conference at CDC was not necessarily reassuring.

Sporting his trademark red 2020 campaign hat with the slogan “Keep America Great,” the president repeatedly second-guessed and waved off the actual medical professionals standing next to him. He attacked his Democratic rivals — including calling Washington Gov. Jay Inslee a “snake” for criticizing his response — and chided a CNN reporter for smiling and called her network “fake news.” And he described coronavirus testing kits — which his administration has been criticized for being slow to distribute — as “beautiful” and saying they were as “perfect” as his Ukraine phone call last summer that led him to be impeached.

Mapping the spread of the coronavirus in the U.S. and worldwide

The upshot was that the self-proclaimed medical savant came off looking less interested in his administration’s unsteady efforts to mitigate the spread of the virus than he was in bolstering his own status in a campaign year. Trump repeatedly sought to judge his administration’s performance by the numbers of how many have been shown to have contracted the virus and comparing it to other nations — and, in doing so, appeared to be making judgments based solely on that scorecard.

AD

He declared he would prefer to keep the thousands of passengers and crew on the cruise ship off the California coast aboard the vessel rather than bring them ashore for quarantine, though he acknowledged that Vice President Pence and other top aides were arguing for the ship to be brought to port.

“I like the numbers being where they are,” Trump said. “I don’t need the numbers to double because of one ship that wasn’t our fault.” He had been furious last month upon learning that Americans in China with coronavirus were flown back to the United States in a decision made by the State Department without consulting him.

Asked if a decision had been made about the latest ship’s fate, Trump appeared uncertain. “Uh, that’s a good question,” he responded. He later said he authorized his aides to decide — and Pence announced at a news briefing in Washington shortly after the president concluded his remarks that the ship would, in fact, be directed to a noncommercial port where everyone on board would be tested.

AD

For the president, the reporters’ follow-up questions about the rate of coronavirus testing were a nuisance. CDC Director Robert Redfield and Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar stressed that the administration had authorized tens of thousands of testing kits to be distributed. But as Azar sought to parry with a reporter by calling on Redfield to back him up, Trump, without looking at Azar, raised his right hand and waved him off. 

21 people test positive for coronavirus on California cruise ship

Redfield said the agency had sent out 75,000 kits. Then Trump jumped in: “Anybody who wants a test will get a test, that’s the bottom line.” A few moments later, he jokingly compared the situation to his phone call last summer in which he had pressured Ukraine’s president to launch an investigation into Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden and his son.

“The tests are all perfect, like the letter was perfect, the transcription was perfect, right?” Trump said. “This was not as perfect as that, but pretty good.”

AD

Trump argued that the death rate in the United States — 15 Americans have died of the virus, though Trump said 11 — remains artificially high because many people who have the illness are not reporting to hospitals because their symptoms are minor. While experts have said that is probably true, the argument seemed to undercut Trump’s efforts to minimize the scope of the crisis.

While explaining this, Trump appeared irritated by the reaction of a reporter. “You’re smiling when I say that. Where are you from?” he asked. When she replied CNN, the president snapped: “I don’t watch CNN. That’s why I don’t recognize you. I don’t watch CNN because CNN is fake news.”

The medical professionals around him smiled uncomfortably.

AD

The president had a more positive reaction to Fox News. While explaining he had watched the network’s coronavirus coverage aboard Air Force One en route from Nashville — where he had toured tornado damage earlier in the day — to Atlanta, Trump cut himself off.

“How was the show last night?” Trump asked a Fox reporter in the room, referring to a Fox News-produced, town hall-style event in Scranton, Pa., that he had participated in the night before.

“Did it get good ratings?” Trump said. The reporter said he didn’t know. “Oh, really?” Trump continued. “I heard it broke all ratings records. But maybe that’s wrong. That’s what they told me.”

As his aides did their best to curry Trump’s favor — they praised his leadership and sought to reinforce some of his pronouncements — the president opined on the falling stock markets, insisting he is happy that Americans are canceling travel plans abroad to “stay in the United States and spend money in the United States.”

AD

Though his CDC trip had been canceled over a coronavirus scare at the agency — before being reinstated after the employee tested negative — Trump boasted that he was taking no special precautions while touring the labs.

“Not at all,” he said. “I’m not a person who has been big on handshaking. They used to make fun of me. But as a politician, you walk in and the doctors have their hands out, ‘Hello, sir.’ That’s my business. I never thought I’d be a politician. But I feel very secure.”"

Larry Hogan (R) said Friday that the Montgomery County residents who contracted coronavirus later attended events that involved schoolchildren in suburban Philadelphia and a Rockville retirement community, where up to 100 people could have been exposed to the virus.

Hogan also said the patients contracted the virus on an Egyptian cruise on the Nile River.

  The governor has declared a state of emergency to speed the delivery of funding and other resources to address the virus.

This is a developing story. It will be updated.

Original story is below:

Maryland health officials have launched a search for other people potentially infected with coronavirus, after three Montgomery County residents were found to have contracted the virus while traveling overseas.

County health workers are doing most of the work to track down anyone who might have come in contact with the three patients — a husband and wife in their 70s and a woman in her 50s."

\[TL;DR: Time for pandemic mitigation. Aggressive precautions to mitigate spread so hospitals aren't overwhelmed. Prepare for supply issues. \]

This is a difficult message to share, but it is important to **recognize how difficult the times ahead may be and how you must now take assertive action to prepare for them**. Our local situation surrounding novel coronavirus (COVID-19) is changing rapidly.  COVID-19 is spreading in our community, the extent of which is unclear. It has likely been spreading for weeks, perhaps months. I have no reason to believe that how it’s spreading in other counties won’t be replicated to some degree here. We now all need to take assertive actions to inhibit the spread of this new virus. Some of those actions are described below. I advise that individuals, schools, business, and all other sectors of our community take immediate steps to change behaviors and take definitive action.

**Our lives will be significantly disrupted** by the measures needed to respond to a global pandemic. A pandemic is a global occurrence of an infectious disease. A pandemic is a disaster with unique characteristics. The two most important differences between a pandemic and other disasters are that the whole world is going through this disaster at the same time, and people may become fearful of other people. The current COVID-19 outbreak clearly has the potential to turn into a severe pandemic.

County Health continues to work with the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and our state and local partners to manage testing and monitoring of persons who have been exposed to COVID-19. But our **focus is rapidly changing from a containment strategy (identifying cases and contacts) to one of community mitigation—taking steps to lessen the broad impact of the disease.** County Health and our public and private partners are taking steps to increase our ability to respond and are planning for a sustained response to COVID-19.

**How the world operates during a pandemic is different from how the world operates normally. This is not business as usual.** With a pandemic comes significant disruption to supply chains (the process of how things get from where they are made to where they are used), transportation, and travel. Even if the disease is not rapidly spreading in our area, we may face difficulty obtaining the goods and services we are accustomed to, public events may be canceled, and our ability to travel might be restricted.

San Mateo County Health continues to advise that the steps to prevent the spread of flu will also guard against the spread of COVID-19: cover your cough and sneeze, wash your hands frequently, avoid shaking hands and touching your face with unwashed hands, and if you are not feeling well or are experiencing cold, flu, or other symptoms, stay home from school or work. If you are mildly ill, there is no need to contact your primary care provider as they are very busy right now. If you are significantly ill, contact your primary care provider.

Here are the most important things for you to consider to improve your personal and organizational preparedness:

**What matters most is how households, neighborhoods, community groups, businesses, and other organizations prepare. What does that mean? Preparedness equals self-sufficiency. The government will help where it can, but it may have a limited ability to respond directly to you due to the scale of the disruptions.** 

Individual and community preparations should focus on three tasks—**reducing each person’s chance of getting sick** (see both individual and more general public health recommendations both above and below), **helping households with basic survival needs** during a pandemic, and minimizing and **coping with larger disruptions in how the normal day-to-day world works**.

All businesses and other organizations should now be done reviewing their continuity of operations plans for how they will operate if their employees are unable to work and how they will interact with members of the public and prepare to implement these plans soon.

**All medical facilities and providers should be done reviewing their surge plans for how to handle increased numbers of patients and be prepared to implement.**

Getting ready for a pandemic is largely about preparing for possible shortages. In a pandemic, supply chain disruptions are inevitable but are also unpredictable.

Since it contains vital supplies, a good start is to make sure your earthquake kit is up to date and ready to go. Of course, having supplies beyond the typical earthquake kit is a good idea. What you decide to have on hand is based on your individual and family situation and your individual preferences.

One likely shortage will be medications. **You should attempt to obtain a couple of months supply for your critical medications.**

**If you have other critical supply needs, you should conserve them and stock up on them now.**

Now is also the time to think about how you will care for loved ones at home if they or you are sick and how you would limit spread within the family.

Frequent and appropriate hand-washing is far from a perfect solution, but it’s easy, under your control, and has no significant downside.

Like washing your hands, wearing a surgical mask may help a bit, but you need to know that surgical masks don’t offer much protection when they are worn by people who are well. They are most helpful when worn by those who are already sick so that they are less likely to transmit the disease to others. Surgical masks and masks offering higher levels of respiratory protection are already in short supply and should be prioritized for use in health care settings.

You should use a barrier, such as a paper towel or tissue, to touch commonly touched surfaces, such as any door handles or elevator buttons.

&#x200B;

**Change from my previous message: I am now asking for the implementation of the activities below at this time.**

**All non-essential gatherings should be canceled, postponed, or done remotely. Unfortunately, at this time, I have no standard definition of “non-essential” or “gathering” to guide your decisions.  Use your best judgment.**

**Stop shaking hands.**

**Increase in the amount of remote working or teleworking to the extent possible especially for those who appear at higher risk for developing the disease, those over the age of 60 and those with co-morbid conditions.**

**Under all circumstances, stop touching your face, eyes, nose, or mouth with your unwashed hands.**

&#x200B;

I am **not** asking for the implementation of these activities *\[listed below\]*, but these are the types of activities we may need to implement in the future:

School closures. Schools are an essential gathering. School closings present a particularly vexing social distancing dilemma but may be necessary to protect public health. Once school closings occur, they may be extensive and extended.

Social distancing—staying at least 6 feet away from all other people—should be attempted where possible.

Rationing (a formal process of prioritizing distribution and use) of critical supplies may need to occur.

To get ourselves through the hard times that may be coming, your community may need volunteers. Think now about the skills you have and how you can help your community. Heed the call should volunteers be requested.

Other public health interventions that have been used with some effect in other countries include commandeering of both real estate or personal property, conscription, curfew, and cordons. It is unlikely that these interventions would be used here due to practical considerations.

Issues around testing for COVID-19. You may have received incorrect information from the federal and state government on March 4, 2020. San Mateo County does not currently have testing available independently of the state and CDC. The amount of testing that is available through the state and CDC is severely limited. Should testing become more widely available, testing will be prioritized based on healthcare infrastructure concerns, risk of exposure, and/or very sick hospitalized patients. Tests will not automatically be given upon request or by a physician’s order. This may change as testing capacity evolves over the next few months.

This is a phase I, open-label, dose ranging clinical trial in males and non-pregnant females, 18 to 55 years of age, inclusive, who are in good health and meet all eligibility criteria. This clinical trial is designed to assess the safety, reactogenicity and immunogenicity of mRNA-1273 manufactured by ModernaTX, Inc. mRNA-1273 is a novel lipid nanoparticle (LNP)-encapsulated mRNA-based vaccine that encodes for a full-length, prefusion stabilized spike (S) protein of 2019-novel coronavirus (nCoV). Enrollment will occur at one domestic site. Forty-five subjects will be enrolled into one of three cohorts and will receive an intramuscular (IM) injection of mRNA-1273 on Days 1 and 29 in the deltoid muscle. **Subjects will be followed through 12 months post second vaccination (Day 394).** 

The primary objective is to evaluate the safety and reactogenicity of a 2-dose vaccination schedule of mRNA-1273, given 28 days apart, across 3 dosages in healthy adults."

I love my mother, don't get me wrong, but she is a very dramatic, flowery, artsy, naive, loving person. She watches the news all day long and kind of loves to panic about whatever the biggest news is. So obviously, she's freaking out about the coronavirus, but I can tell that she's also getting dopamine hits from all the panic and talking about it non-stop. I've always grown up with her being like this, so unfortunately it's caused me to be kind of nonchalant and blase in reaction. This has caused issues in other areas of my life: for example, my mom has outrageous confidence, and I think because that always sort of embarrassed me, I have downplayed myself way too much.

Anyway, I'm just venting because this coronavirus stuff is so frustrating with her. She is immunocompromised, but is a major one-upper, so things always feel like a competition for who is sicker. And she's going on and on about how much at risk she is. Which, don't get me wrong, she *is*. But her hysteria about it makes me want to not talk to her about it at all, which makes it seem like I don't care, which frustrates her in turn. And she is *impossible* to reason with, so it's not like I can tell her to ""cool it."" anyway, I'm just frustrated because I can't have a normal conversation about this with her. On top of that, as other commenters have said, it seems impossible to figure out how much we should all be worried about this.

H1N1, first off, is a flu - a variant, yes, but still a flu.  People can build resistance, they can incorporate it into vaccines, various antiviral treatments generally work, etc.  If you've had similar flu previously, you could have partial resistance to H1N1.

As far as I know, there is no antiviral for a coronavirus yet.  They do not seem to cause long-term immunity or resistance (e.g., you can be reinfected).  There's no vaccine.  There is no partial resistance that is known.

This isn't to scare anyone; these are just the current facts.  This is not a flu.  There are legitimate reasons to be concerned - not to panic, but also not to blow it off like nothing.  Society will adapt, medical science will help, and eventually it'll be a non-concern at the community level.  But that's not the case right now.

I'm not sure where I am on the ""close campus down"" scale.  The reality is that finals bring pretty much the whole student body together in large, often-close-quarters groups multiple times in shifting groupings for a week - and then many/most of those students leave campus and go out into the community for a week or two.  That's pretty much a worst-case scenario if there's any significant presence of the virus here.  But what is ""significant""?  How do you draw that line?  I don't know.

And I say this as someone who isn't worried about finals, so it's not like I'm looking to get out of them.

UCLA can't exactly prevent people from leaving campus and going home for break.  All the school can do is try and reduce any spreading before that.  I'm a little worried that there \*won't\* be anything major found - until \*after\* finals and everyone has headed home.  At which point it'll be too late.  Is that a good enough reason to significantly interrupt the quarter and the finals schedule?  Again, I don't know.

This is probably what campus admin and health officials are debating right now.  I wouldn't want to be in their shoes."

Few details were available about the worker, but Los Angeles County health officials said they still don’t see signs of community spread.    
     
“We know that as we see increased cases there’s greater concern in some of our communities as to what this means ... for the general public, your risk still remains low, though this is the time you make sure you’re practicing good public health hygiene,” said county health director Barbara Ferrer.

Since then, officials have been testing other workers
      
In a statement, the Department of Homeland Security described the worker as a medical screener who “wore all the correct protective equipment and took necessary protections on the job.”      

“As soon as the individual began to feel sick, they self-quarantined, saw a physician, and reported to the appropriate authorities and officials,” a DHS spokesperson said in the statement.     
     
Here are steps LAX says it has taken:      

     
--Installing more than 250 additional hand sanitizer stations throughout our terminals at LAX.     

--Cleaning our public areas and restrooms at least once per hour.      

--Using virus and bacteria-killing disinfectants.     

--Increasing deep cleaning throughout the airport, focusing on “high touch” areas at the airport such as handrails, escalators, elevator buttons and restroom doors.      

--Coordinating with contracting partners to ensure that their cleaning crews are following the same protocols.     

--Adding signage to high-traffic areas, including areas with passengers, with information on how to reduce the spread of illness and symptoms of the coronavirus."

Or imagine that he at least heard and heeded the warning by the tragically muzzled Dr. Li Wenliang at the end of that month.

Acting on that information by, say, shorting the highflying Nasdaq Composite might have sounded like a good idea, but the results would have been disastrous. By the time the index hit its intraday record on Feb. 19, a forewarned investor would have trailed that index by about 30 and 20 percentage points, respectively.

Yet one fund that makes its living protecting portfolios from such events may have reaped a bonanza in February without such insights. Universa, managed by Mark Spitznagel, a protégé of “The Black Swan: The Impact of the Highly Improbable” author Nassim Nicholas Taleb, managed a little over $4 billion in assets as of the end of 2018. Claude Bovet, founder of Lionscrest Capital and a long time investor in the fund, estimates that Universa’s tail risk hedging strategy, representing part of its capital, earned more than 1,000% in a matter of days.

“It was a great month for us,” says Mr. Spitznagel, who declined to disclose a dollar figure on those gains. He did point out, though, that the fund’s positions are “convex to the market.” In other words, its strategy of using options and similar instruments can register profits that escalate in much more than a linear fashion, suggesting a handsome payoff indeed. Back in August 2015 the fund made over $1 billion, or 20%, in a single day when the Dow had what was then its largest ever intraday plunge of over 1,000 points, ending down by 588 points.

The index lost 3,583 points last week—its worst such period since the financial crisis and sharpest ever drop from a peak. Yet, even as patients were succumbing to the illness in Wuhan, the cost of placing bets in the run-up to the selloff was extremely low as represented by the Cboe Volatility Index, or VIX. The so-called fear gauge, it represents the cost of purchasing options as expressed by the implied volatility embedded in their prices.

Universa hedged without timing the market or taking a risk, which holds a lesson about risk, reward and complacency. While many reasonable investors were tempted to sell tech stocks or bet against them—2,000 people had died by the day they peaked—Universa ignored the headlines and focused only on what the numbers said. They told it that insurance was cheap.

“If you have a position that can lose 1 to make 100, like Universa’s tail hedge at any point in time, you don’t care about your timing of a market crash, you just don’t want to miss it,” says Mr. Spitznagel.

Buying protection in such a fund is akin to purchasing insurance from an optimistic underwriter—writing small monthly checks and very rarely receiving a big one in return. Returns can be negative for years. Yet even during a mostly excellent run for U.S. stocks, the strategy trounced the stock market in its first 10 years through February 2018, according to a leaked client letter.

Mr. Spitznagel, who acknowledges spending all of his time “thinking about looming disaster,” expressed no view on what the impact of the Covid-19 epidemic might now be on stock prices.

Even so, his advice to those with a bearish inclination is hardly uplifting: “For people who are worried about having missed it, this selloff has only taken back a few months of gains. I expect a true crash to take back a decade.”"

2020-03-06,saltandvinegarnomnom,Coronavirus,8,https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/fe8pt6/opinion_life_in_seattle_americas_coronavirus/fjmj4uq/,"SEATTLE — There is a strange in-betweenness to life in the nation’s coronavirus capital. Classes continue on the University of Washington’s campus, some half-empty, others completely full. I have been teaching here 13 years, and faculty members have been getting detailed, palpably anxious instructions from administrators on how to teach online and on hand-washing and social distance, and reminders that no one on our 46,000-student campus has tested positive for the coronavirus that causes Covid-19. For now.

The local schools my children attend were deep-cleaned last weekend, and they were still open on Thursday. Rumors fly through middle-schoolers’ text strings, neighborhood message boards, conversations in the grocery line. We’re all at the store daily, stocking up on canned goods and paper towels, awaiting news of school closings and home quarantines. Costco is overrun. A friend told me about a beleaguered Costco employee who had to stand in a corner of the store yelling, “No toilet paper!” over and over, and redirecting shoppers from the empty pallets.

Of course, the dangers here are much greater than running out of toilet paper. Sixty-nine people have already been found to have the novel coronavirus in the Seattle area. Ten have died, most of them residents of one suburban nursing facility. The county government bought a motel to quarantine infected patients. It is likely to get worse: Analysis by scientists who studied the local cases indicates that the virus may well have been present in the area for up to six weeks. Like the seasonal flu, the coronavirus is most dangerous to the old and medically vulnerable, but the only way to halt its spread is to change nearly everyone’s behavior.

The tech companies that dominate this region’s economy have been the most aggressive in making changes. Microsoft and Amazon moved quickly to cancel nonessential travel. Amazon, Microsoft and Facebook have recommended that employees in the area work from home if they can until the end of March. Yet the Emerald City Comic Con, which drew nearly 100,000 people last year to downtown, is still on. Flights continue at Seattle-Tacoma International Airport. Passengers are screened for the virus as they arrive from China, but Seattleites are not necessarily screened as we depart.

A region so dependent on tourism and international travel is reluctant to slow down. But we may have to, and not just in the near term. I wonder when the flight cancellations will begin. Maybe Comic Con won’t happen. Maybe my children will spend this summer making up the lost time in school. Maybe I will be teaching my spring classes remotely, one of thousands of telecommuters whose absence from the roads will at last make our region’s traffic jams go away.

Maybe, maybe.

It is humbling to be so uncertain about the future in this overeducated boomtown, this hub of technology, medical research and global health that usually spends its time eradicating epidemics, not succumbing to them. It is humbling to be at the mercy of such a seemingly unstoppable virus amid a rickety and inequitable American health care system.

The crisis is also forcing us to refocus our attention locally, hitting pause on the national news and global business and the perpetual crossing of time zones that is a feature of life for so many of us in the nation’s rainy upper left.

We citizens of this high-speed, 21st-century place are now getting a taste for what life was like in the American cities of the 19th century, which were regularly devastated by typhoid and cholera and tuberculosis. Then and now, being a global crossroads made Seattle vulnerable. More than 1,400 Seattleites died in the influenza pandemic of 1918, a mortality rate spiked by the movement of people through the region’s port and crowded military bases. These diseases also had no vaccine or cure at the time, but their dangers were far greater because so little was understood about how to prevent their spread

Another humbling realization is that the steps Seattle took to confront that epidemic were much the same as those we take now: Avoid crowds, stay home, wash your hands. Our only modern twists are hand sanitizer and substituting elbow bumps for handshakes. Our skin may crack from all the hand-washing and sanitizing, but at least we understand how to best protect ourselves.
But we are a long way from the cataclysm of 1918.

For now, we gain a new appreciation for the people and institutions that keep a city running. We turn on the local news, scan the bulletins from the county public health department, listen to the news conferences held by the mayor and the county executive. There’s uncertainty there, too: Can the public health agencies denuded by budget cuts meet surging needs? Are there enough local news outlets to fully report the story? Shouldn’t we all stop going to work or school now? Local leaders don’t know what is going to happen either. But they calm us with their consistency and expertise, and we trust them.

It shouldn’t take a global pandemic to force us to slow down our routines, to appreciate the communities in which we live, to properly wash our hands. But it has.

So life in Seattle will go on, quieter and more local than before. I will keep reading the local news. I will plan my next lectures, grateful for the software that will let me deliver them virtually if necessary. I will look toward a spring with perhaps far less travel, fewer reasons to leave home.

2020-03-06,jimkolowski,Coronavirus,8,https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/fegpyz/taiwan_sets_gold_standard_on_epidemic_response_to/fjnvpdn/,"Taiwan sits just 81 miles from the coast of China, more than 800,000 of its citizens live there and hundreds of daily connecting flights normally service business travel and tourism, but it has defied predictions of a widespread coronavirus outbreak and kept infection rates to just 44 isolated cases.

As nearby Japan and South Korea reel with thousands of infections, experts say Taiwan, an island of 23 million, has kept the virus at bay through early intervention, a slick command structure, well-rehearsed epidemic strategy and transparent communication that other countries including the UK could learn from.

By late December, before the coronavirus was on the world’s radar, Taiwan’s government was already sensing danger from rumours of a new respiratory disease emerging from Wuhan, and officials began boarding flights to check the health of passengers from the Chinese city.

Taipei began to block flights from China and quarantine people from infected zones before other Asian capitals chose to do so, and Taiwan’s Centres for Disease Control issue daily updates and regular warnings about the locations infected Covid-19 patients visited before their diagnosis.

Public buildings including schools, malls and office blocks require anyone entering to disinfect their hands, and the government quickly averted panic over a face mask shortage with rationing an official stockpile of 44 million masks that ensured a steady flow to the public.

Audrey Tang, the digital minister, topped the strategy with an online tracing system that allows people to search for pharmacies that have remaining stock, to avoid queuing in vain.

Taiwan’s alertness and expertise were borne out of the trauma of the Sudden Acute Respiratory Syndrome (Sars) that ravaged the island in 2003, and out of a deep mistrust of China and the World Health Organisation who, senior officials claim, delayed vital assistance to counter the disease.

China claims the island, which functions like any other democratic nation, as its own territory which it intends to annex. Beijing has pressured international forums, including the WHO, to exclude Taiwan, claiming it has no right to forge independent diplomatic ties.

In the case of epidemic disease control, Taiwan argues this policy endangers lives. On the plus side, it has forced the authorities to gameplan robust self-protection measures.

“After Sars, they were already preparing for the next \[epidemic\],” Jason Wang, an associate professor of pediatrics at Stanford Medicine in California, told the Telegraph. “You want governments to do stuff before you know it’s happening.”

He added: “The establishment of the national health command centre was really critical. It’s like a little compound where all the information comes from local and central government and it all gets integrated. You get the data, process it and then you can tell people what’s going on.”

In a paper published by the Journal of the American Medical Association this week, Professor Wang and co-author Robert Brook, a professor of medicine, praised Taiwan’s response, highlighting its use of big data, new technology and pro-active testing of patients with severe respiratory difficulties.

Taiwan combined tight border control from the air and sea with swift identification and quarantine of suspicious cases. National health and immigration information was integrated to track individuals at high risk because of recent travel to affected areas and their home quarantine was monitored through their phones.

Meanwhile, a hotline was set up in each major city for citizens to report suspicious symptoms.

“Through early recognition of the crisis, daily briefings to the public, and simple health messaging, the government was able to reassure the public by delivering timely, accurate, and transparent information regarding the evolving epidemic,” they concluded.

“Taiwan is an example of how a society can respond quickly to a crisis and protect the interests of its citizens.”"

My 7-year old is coughing now and told me she felt nauseated and hot at school last week, but the school nurse took her temperature and found it normal, so no one ever mentioned it to me. 

I live in a state with no known community spread cases, so it seems unlikely to be the new Coronavirus, but these mild cold symptoms that I wouldn’t have thought twice about last year have me thinking we should be avoiding their grandparents.

Clusters of infections have turned up around large gatherings of adults—at churches, old-age homes, conventions—but there have been no reported school-based outbreaks among children. In Singapore, which reported 117 confirmed coronavirus infections as of Thursday, officials have left the schools open and no clusters or outbreaks have emerged from them, according to Dale Fisher, a professor of infectious disease at the National University of Singapore.

So we should suspend churches and other religious services, and conventions (like maybe ComicCon in Seattle) ASAP because they known vectors.

We can't shut nursing homes, but we can limit access to them and be more proactive about testing residents and workers.

Here are the mitigation efforts we are performing and a plan we've strategized in the event that one of us gets sick and infected with coronavirus (*and cannot seek medical help for some reason*).

Feel free to leave any feedback or improvements to the plan, also feel free to adapt/use this as a potential framework.

# Mitigation Efforts

* When arriving home, all roommates **MUST** use hand sanitizer at the door **BEFORE** touching any other surfaces  

   * One may also use the sink located in the laundry room, *assuming the infected roommate plan is not in place*
* Shoes must be taken off at the door and carried to your bedroom
* All roommates should participate in sanitizing high touch surfaces with lysol wipes including light switches, door knobs, handles, faucets, toilet, shower, and other areas
* All dishes must be placed in the dishwasher  

   * Dishes may be placed in the sink if the dishwasher is running
* All large gatherings must seek roommate approval to host
* **If you display any symptoms (fever, coughing, shortness of breath, sore throat) all roommates must be notified immediately regardless of severity**  

   * **Depending on severity of symptoms, the other roommates will have the final call on enacting the infected roommate plan or requesting the potentially infected roommate to seek medical help**
   * **See infected roommate plan for mitigation efforts**

# Infected Roommate Plan ☣︎

In the event one of us becomes infected or shows strong symptoms of the virus, here are the proposed mitigation efforts.

* If light symptoms (cough/fever/sore throat), they should isolate in their bedroom and follow the below mitigation measures.
* If strong symptoms (persistent fever/cough/sore throat/trouble breathing) the person should seek medical care at a hospital. The following mitigation measures apply.
* Self quarantine in their bedroom until the fever and cough has subsided for 48 hours without use of flu medication/cough suppressant/fever reducers
* When leaving their bedroom a non ventilated N-95 or surgical mask must be worn at all times by the infected person.  

   * Close all windows in the quarantine room before leaving, to ensure the draft does not carry the virus through the house (in the event of the front door opening)
* **Before** entering the bathroom or kitchen, they must use the sink located in the laundry room to wash their hands with soap and water or use hand sanitizer.
* A trash bag must be kept in their own bedroom. All tissues, food scraps, trash, etc. must be disposed of in their own garbage bag, NOT in the communal garbage locations, including the bathroom.  

   * When the garbage bag is full, they must notify the other roommates to dispose of it properly.  

      * The garbage bag must be taken directly from their bedroom/door **DIRECTLY** to the curb (*regardless of day of week*). Gloves are required for touching trash and the person must clean their hands after.
* After using the bathroom they must sanitize (lysol wipe) any touched surface including sink faucets, light switches, shower doors, or other surfaces.  

   * If they are unable to perform this task, they must notify the other roommates that they have used the restroom and did not sanitize surfaces
* Towels for the restroom must be kept in their own bedroom and placed in a specific location within the bathroom (designated towel rack) to be sanitized after.
* If using the shower, after use they must notify other roommates that they have used the shower so it can be properly sanitized
* If using the laundry machine, after use they must sanitize the laundry machine with an empty load and ½ cup of bleach or notify roommates to perform this task
* All dishes MUST be placed in the dishwasher  

   * If the dishwasher is running, they must leave dishes in their room until they can be safely placed in the dishwasher.
* Roommate(s) will be tasked with leaving food/water/supplies in front of their door, grocery shopping, and ensuring their comfort during their quarantine/illness
* All high touch surfaces must be cleaned consistently by the other roommates
* Constant communication with the infected person to ensure their health & wellbeing via digital chat or checking by knocking on their door
* Contact information of the infected persons parents/contacts should be shared
* Insurance information should be made available so roommates will have knowledge in the event medical assistance is required"

2020-03-06,geekyOldFart,Coronavirus,8,https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/feltv0/grand_princess_passengers_crew_members_test/fjovfrg/,"Coronavirus: Why are only 45 of 3,533 aboard Grand Princess being tested?

They are numbers that are sure to raise questions amid fears of the potentially deadly new coronavirus: Health officials are testing just 45 of the 3,533 people aboard the Grand Princess cruise ship where a passenger on its last voyage died of the respiratory disease.

Health officials expect to release results of those tests Friday and decide how and when passengers can leave the ship. Whatever the results show, there are bound to be concerns about whether testing fewer than 2 percent of those aboard for the disease known as COVID-19 was thorough enough.

But health experts say it is impractical and unnecessary to test everyone aboard the ship.

“The problem is that currently there are not enough tests yet,” said Dr. John Swartzberg, an Internist, specialist in infectious disease and clinical professor emeritus at UC Berkeley’s School of Public Health. “So we have to use them in a judicious fashion. And how do you effectively quarantine 3,000 people? We can’t.”

There have been no updates on their status, said passenger Suzanne Suwanda of Los Gatos in a Facebook video post she playfully called “Radio Free ‘Grand Princess’ – Broadcasting To You From Off the Coast of San Francisco.”

Food is being delivered, 99 movies will be added to their on-demand cable programming and there’s a new video of the cruise’s stage show that, sequestered in their cabins, they can’t watch live, she said.

“We are still waiting to hear…No news, no updates,” said Suwanda. “I’m writing songs, reading, trying to stay cheerful, and wondering what will happen next.”

With the right steps, experts said, the Grand Princess can avoid the disastrous experience of the Diamond Princess, where six people died and 706 of 2,666 passengers and 1,045 crew were infected last month. Japanese health officials’ decision to quarantine those aboard the docked ship drew widespread criticism that it likely helped spread the disease among them.

It is essential to get passengers and crew off the infected ship, said epidemiologist Dr. Michael J. Mina of the Harvard Medical School and Brigham and Women’s Hospital.

“I think one of the major lessons we learned from the Diamond Princess is not to leave people on board under quarantine with the hopes that they will not spread infection and will, as a population, remain healthy,” he said.

He also advised follow-up testing on land, as well as self-quarantines.

The concern over the Grand Princess surfaced Wednesday after Gov. Gavin Newsom announced that California’s first COVID-19 fatality involved an elderly Rocklin man who had been aboard the ship on its last voyage to Mexico that began in San Francisco on Feb. 11 and ended on Feb. 21.

Two other passengers who were on that trip also are confirmed to have been infected, including a friend of his from Sonoma County who now is hospitalized.

Sonoma County authorities Thursday confirmed a second presumptive positive case was a county resident who had traveled on the Grand Princess from San Francisco to Mexico, and said both infected county residents are in isolation rooms at a local hospital. The CDC will conduct another test to confirm the diagnosis.

And Contra Costa County officials Friday identified three new cases of residents infected with COVID-19, two of whom had been on the Grand Princess. That would bring to five the total number of passengers from the prior cruise who tested positive.

Bay Area health departments have been monitoring dozens of passengers who were on the ship’s February Mexico trip. On Thursday, Sunnyvale police said they unsuccessfully attempted to revive an unconscious 72-year-old man who had been aboard the cruise ship and has since died. It is not known yet whether the man had contracted COVID-19.

Princess Cruise Lines said this week that fewer than 100 of the Grand Princess’ 2,422 pasengers and 1,111 crew were considered at risk and need testing. Those include passengers from the previous Mexico voyage who remained on board for the current Hawaii trip as well as those aboard with influenza-like illness symptoms or under treatment for other respiratory illness.

Health experts also said it is essential to get passengers and crew off the ship, and advised follow-up testing as well as possible quarantines once they are ashore.

“Instead, there should be testing and screening on as many passengers and crew as possible — and, more so, the passengers and crew should be evacuated from the cruise ship and brought on land,” Mina said.

“This is a tough ask for the city of San Francisco,” Mina added, but “ultimately, the right thing to do is to remove the individuals from the cruise ship, test them and find a place for them where they can truly self-isolate and self-quarantine, safely.”

The choices facing the Grand Princess are fraught, health experts said.

At sea, “running 35 tests is different than running 3,500 tests,” said Dr. Art Reingold, Division Head of Epidemiology and Biostatistics at Berkeley Public Health and director of the CDC-funded California Emerging Infections Program.

Could its passengers — now symptom-free — be incubating the virus and become positive over the next several days?

“The answer is — potentially — yes,” said Reingold.

Even if every passenger tested negative, there’s no assurance that some might not go on to develop disease, said UC Berkeley’s Swartzberg.

The test isn’t sufficiently sensitive to detect very early infections, he said. It seeks viral RNA – and early in a coronavirus infection, there’s just not that much RNA to find.

“If I got off that boat, I’d go into quarantine regardless of what the tests show,” he said. “If it’s positive, I’d quarantine. If it’s negative, I’d quarantine. I would assume I had been infected. I would avoid loved ones and everybody else until I’m sure I’m not. That’s the safest thing to do.”

WHO said about 100,000 people worldwide have been infected with COVID-19 since the outbreak began in China in December, and more than 3,300 have died. Most of the infections and deaths have been in China, but some 17,000 cases and more than 300 deaths have been reported in more than 80 other countries, in particular South Korea, Italy and Iran.

There are at least 148 confirmed U.S. cases, and a hospital in Washington state Friday announced a 12th person had died there from coronavirus, bringing to 15 the total deaths from the respiratory illness in the country.

The California Department of Public Health said Thursday there are 69 confirmed cases in the state. Of those, 24 involved U.S. citizens repatriated from infected areas abroad, 22 were recent travelers to China or other infection hot zones, 12 caught the disease from someone in their home or from exposure in a health care facility. Nine appear to have been community acquired involving people with no known exposure risk and the infection source of two others remains unknown.

More than 9,900 people are self-monitoring after returning to the U.S. through San Francisco or Los Angeles international airports."

> Reporting note: Coronavirus, officially known as COVID-19, is a new strain of coronavirus that has surged around the globe in recent months. The coronaviruses are a family of viruses that cause illnesses ranging from the common cold to more serious respiratory diseases. Flu is caused by a different virus. There is no vaccine for coronavirus, though researchers are working on one and hope to begin testing soon. Older people, especially those with chronic illnesses such as heart or lung disease, are most at risk. The coronavirus spreads mainly through coughs and sneezes, though it also can be transferred from surfaces. The best way to prevent infection is by frequent hand-washing, cleaning surfaces with regular household sprays and wipes, and avoiding close contact with people who are sick.

This seems like...remarkably responsible journalism, and something other outlets should do. A simple statement that establishes very basic truths about the virus - basically a way of getting out ahead of misinformation."

As for the flu. We know the flu, we know how to treat the flu, we have a vaccine for the flu, we have public health awareness of the flu, AND IT STILL KILLS TENS OF THOUSANDS. Now look at coronavirus where we have no vaccine on the horizon, about two months of data on how it spreads, approximately 20% of cases require hospitalization.

A toilet plume is the dispersal of microscopic particles as a result of flushing a toilet.  Normal use of a toilet by healthy people is considered unlikely to be a major health risk.  There is indirect evidence that specific pathogens such as norovirus or SARS coronavirus could potentially be spread by toilet aerosols, but as of 2015, no direct experimental studies had clearly demonstrated or refuted actual disease transmission from toilet aerosols.  It has been hypothesized that dispersal of pathogens may be reduced by closing the toilet lid before flushing, and by using toilets with lower flush energy.

**By** [**RICHARD READ**](https://www.latimes.com/people/richard-read) **SEATTLE BUREAU CHIEF MARCH 5, 20204:03 PM** SEATTLE —  

Health officials here thought they found a fine place to quarantine COVID-19 patients: a motel that was up for sale.

This week King County completed the $4-million purchase of an Econo Lodge in Kent, Wash., a diverse, lower-income community of 130,000 just south of Seattle.

“We hope to have it operational within days,” County Executive Dow Constantine announced Wednesday at a news conference on the mounting coronavirus deaths. Officials said it could house up to about 80 patients.

But the plan has created a firestorm of opposition in Kent, where community leaders feel blindsided.

“We have invested millions of dollars into the infrastructure around this location, and now visitors and residents will be greeted by a public health quarantine facility,” the mayor, Dana Ralph, said Wednesday at a hastily called news conference. She was flanked by the police chief and the fire chief in a united front of opposition.

“The county intends to bring sick people from wealthier and less diverse communities and drop them off in Kent without regard to our community or the people in it,” Ralph said.

The clash in Washington state, where 11 of the 12 U.S. coronavirus deaths have occurred, could be a preview of conflicts to come as health officials nationwide scramble to find sites where people who test positive can be isolated from the general population. Real estate is more affordable in less affluent areas, raising equity issues.

Kirkland, Wash., where nine of the patients have died, is an upscale, lakefront suburb just east of Seattle, with rapid development of condominiums and pricey new houses replacing old ones. Kent is a longtime farm community whose population has grown as soaring property prices push people out of Seattle.

In 2018, Kent’s median household income was $67,000. Kirkland’s was $107,000.

Mark Scarff, who runs one of the state’s largest Ford-Lincoln dealerships in Kent, said he realizes that coronavirus patients will need to be quarantined somewhere. But he sees the plan to put them in Kent as unfair.

“They’re trying to shove Seattle’s problem away, and away from the affluent places,” he said. “They’re using this outbreak crisis as an excuse to not go through the normal channels, and to shove it down our throat.”

Kent officials were particularly concerned that there would be no legal requirement for people in quarantine to stay in the building, raising the possibility that they would be able to come and go.

“I took an oath to protect our community, which is why I cannot support this ill-advised and dangerous plan by King County,” Police Chief Rafael Padilla said at the news conference.

In an interview Thursday, Ralph said she found out thirdhand Monday evening about the motel purchase. After she called Constantine’s office, she learned that county health officials had been considering the hotel for months as a permanent quarantine facility for patients with hepatitis, tuberculosis, measles and other illnesses.

Ralph said King County is divided into two economies. Seattle and its east side have Amazon, Microsoft and other booming companies, with wealthy, predominantly white bedroom communities. On the other side are places like Kent, which has large numbers of people of Asian, Latino or African American heritage.

“So we’re taking patients currently being exposed in the wealthier communities on the east side and putting them down in the middle of our city,” she said. “An affluent community honestly would have more resources to handle a potential disruption like this.”

Ralph said managers of some of her city’s larger businesses called her and threatened to relocate. “We can’t take that kind of hit to our economy,” she said.

Chase Gallagher, a spokesman for Constantine, said in an interview Thursday that the motel is part of King County’s “coordinated and aggressive response” to the growing outbreak. The county plans to spend $1.5 million fixing up the motel and hiring employees, he said.

He said officials found no other property that met the requirements of the Seattle and King County Public Health agency of having rooms with individual heating and ventilation units and doors that open to the outside instead of a hallway — and certainly none in the $4-million range.

Earlier in the day, the health agency announced 20 more confirmed COVID-19 cases in King County, bringing the total to 51, including 10 deaths. Officials urged people at elevated risk of severe illness to “stay home and away from large groups of people as much as possible.”

Dennis Zaborac, the owner of Kent Bowl, a 32-lane bowling alley near the motel, said that he didn’t mind the county’s plan until he learned that patients wouldn’t be placed in lockdown.

“It makes no sense to follow the quarantine if they can walk in, walk out, and go across the street to Denny’s and have dinner,” he said. “It’s an old hotel where they’ve had trouble with drugs. If they couldn’t control the drugs, how are they going to control the virus?”

He said fears about the coronavirus hadn’t stopped people from bowling, with the usual senior league in action Thursday morning.

Officials are also setting up modular housing units in several sites around King County, in case homeless people become infected with the coronavirus.

News that one 32-room facility is to be located in White Center, an unincorporated area southwest of Seattle, prompted immediate opposition.

“I understand why this facility is needed,” state Sen. Joe Nguyen, a Democrat who represents the neighborhood, wrote in a statement Wednesday. “But the appearance of placing it in a neighborhood that has already been historically marginalized conveys a message about whose safety we most value in our society that is not lost on me.”

By Thursday, after hearing from constituents, Nguyen had refined his view. He said he didn’t oppose putting the units in the neighborhood where he grew up with immigrants and people of color, only that he wanted to be sure they are installed and managed in ways that make residents feel comfortable.

“We get that it’s important, and that we need this,” he said. “For the most part, people have been positive. It’s a very supportive community, and we take care of each other.”"

Larry Hogan (R) said Friday that the Montgomery County residents who contracted coronavirus later attended events that involved schoolchildren in suburban Philadelphia and a Rockville retirement community, where up to 100 people could have been exposed to the virus.

Hogan also said the patients contracted the virus on an Egyptian cruise on the Nile River.

  The governor has declared a state of emergency to speed the delivery of funding and other resources to address the virus.

This is a developing story. It will be updated.

Original story is below:

Maryland health officials have launched a search for other people potentially infected with coronavirus, after three Montgomery County residents were found to have contracted the virus while traveling overseas.

County health workers are doing most of the work to track down anyone who might have come in contact with the three patients — a husband and wife in their 70s and a woman in her 50s.

“It’s a lot of phone calls and left messages and ‘please call me back,’ ” said Assistant Maryland Health Secretary Dr. Jinlene Chan, whose agency is overseeing the statewide effort.

So far, she said, no one identified as potentially exposed has displayed symptoms that warrant testing, and there has been no evidence of transmission within the community.

“We knew this was coming,” Chan said of the three cases, adding that the focus right now is “about trying to contain it.”

The Montgomery County victims returned to Maryland from a cruise on Feb. 20, officials say. They experienced flu-like symptoms and sought medical treatment.

But they were not tested for covid-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus, for nearly two weeks, because at the time of their return, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommended tests only for people who had been traveling in China, Montgomery County Health Officer Travis Gayles said.
Officials declined to say where the three had been traveling but said they did not meet those testing guidelines.

Maryland received its first shipment of test kits last week, and the state lab in Baltimore has been running two batches of tests a day, seven days a week.

Right now, Chan said, testing is limited. But that could change if the state’s caseload increases or community transmissions are detected. Private labs, and possibly some hospital labs, are preparing to start administering testing as well.

She said the state’s health department is fielding calls from physicians, residents and patients, all trying to determine which symptoms warrant testing.

“This is changing so quickly,” Chan said. “The guidance we provide right now might change, and that’s based on what’s changing on the ground.”
Sen. Ben Cardin (D-Md.), who toured the National Institutes of Health vaccine research center in Bethesda Friday afternoon, said test kits are being transported to private labs across the country, which should significantly expand the ability to test potential patients.

“It will reimbursable under Medicare, it will be reimbursable under Medicaid,” he said. “We want to make this an essential health benefit.”

Maryland has received $500 million from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to help stem the outbreak, said Sen. Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.), who also toured NIH.

“We’re all confident that given the passage of the $8.3 billion, the resources will flow to Maryland and other places that need it,” he said referring to a federal funding package signed by President Trump.

The three Montgomery County patients with covid-19 are “in good condition,” Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan (R) said Thursday night. They are quarantined in their homes in the county, a large and affluent suburb of about 1 million people just outside Washington.
The woman is not related to the couple; they were on the same trip, officials said, but were not traveling as a group.

Maryland officials said the state contacted the three earlier this week, after learning from the CDC that they were on a trip that included exposure to the coronavirus.

At a news conference Friday morning, Montgomery County Executive Marc Elrich (D) urged residents to stay calm and said the state and county had been working for weeks to prepare for a possible outbreak.

“There is no reason to panic,” Elrich said. “Life as you know it should continue pretty much as it was.”

Gayles said there is no reason at this point to consider any widespread closures of schools, offices or other institutions in the county. Rather, he said, people who feel sick should stay home, and everyone should take basic precautions like washing their hands using hand sanitizer, and avoiding contact with those who are ill.

Hogan has declared a state of emergency to speed the delivery of funding and other resources to address the virus.

As of Friday morning, 41 Maryland residents had been tested for the coronavirus. Twenty-six of the tests were negative, according to the Maryland Department of Health. Twelve were pending. The only three positive tests were the Montgomery County residents.

Sign up for our Coronavirus Updates newsletter to track the outbreak. All stories linked in the newsletter are free to access.

State and county health officials are trying to determine who else may have been exposed in the days between the victims’ arrival home and when they were tested. They want to clarify exactly where the victims were, “how they came back here and what they’ve been doing since they’ve been back,” Elrich said.

Gayles said state investigators have conducted in-depth interviews known as “contact tracing” with all three patients, In general, such interviews are conducted either over the phone, via video link or in-person, with the investigators wearing protective gear.

Officials try to map out where a person traveled to before being quarantined, who they came into contact with, and what that “quality of interaction” was, Gayles said, taking into account factors like whether they were physically proximate and whether they hugged or shared food.

Each person who had contact with a coronavirus victim is then assigned a risk level, and depending on that assessment, health officials may then decide to do another level of contact tracing.

State and local officials have released very few details about the Montgomery County patients. Hogan spokesman Michael Ricci said he “can’t stress this enough: the patients have asked for privacy. We have to balance that against providing the information necessary to protect public health.”

All three individuals had limited their external interaction leading up to their quarantine because they were not feeling well, Gayles said. They had not been to work, for example. It was not immediately clear how many additional people were considered at-risk and assigned for follow-up contact. The patients are not believed to have had significant contact with children, officials said.

No cases of the coronavirus have been diagnosed in Virginia or the District.

Thirty-one Virginia residents have been tested for coronavirus as of Friday, including 21 whose tests came back negative and 10 that are pending. Three of the pending cases are in Northern Virginia. Nine D.C. residents have been tested; eight tests came back negative, while one is pending.

Metro moved into the second phase of its pandemic response to the coronavirus threat on Friday, canceling non-essential business travel and providing hand sanitizer to frontline employees such as Metrobus operators, a Metro spokesman said.

The system activated its pandemic task force, including transit police and emergency management, in January and ordereddaily wiping down of heavy traffic areas and steering wheels of Metrobuses and ensuring rail cars go through a hospital-level disinfectant process weekly.
The task force also began monitoring absenteeism to look for patterns that might indicate a rash of illness.

In Maryland, the General Assembly has fast-tracked a request from Hogan to access $50 million from the state’s rainy day fund to deal with the coronavirus. The Senate unanimously approved the request on Friday, and the House was expected to vote later in the day. Hogan also submitted a supplemental budget request for fiscal 2021 that would allocate $10 million in emergency expenses to prepare for the coronavirus.

Attorney General Brian E. Frosh (D) warned Maryland residents about scams involving the virus. Frosh said scammers are setting up websites to sell “bogus health products that claim to prevent or cure covid-19.” They are also sending fake emails, texts and social media posts to steal money and personal information, posing as the CDC and the World Health Organization.

Frosh recommended that residents contact his office’s Consumer Protection Division or reporting it to WHO.

Even before COVID-19 became a global crisis, Chinese leaders had been criticized for their handling of the situation and lack of transparency about the disease's progression. Things now look like they're on the upswing, and businesses even appear to be headed back to work — but whistleblowers and local officials tell Caixan that's just a carefully crafted ruse.

Beijing has spent much of the outbreak pushing districts to carry on business as usual, with some local governments subsidizing electricity costs and even installing mandatory productivity quotas. Zhejiang, an province east of the epicenter city of Wuhan, claimed as of Feb. 24 it had restored 98.6 percent of its pre-coronavirus work capacity.

But civil servants tell Caixan that businesses are actually faking these numbers. Beijing had started checking Zhejiang businesses' electricity consumption levels, so district officials ordered the companies to start leaving their lights and machinery on all day to drive the numbers up, one civil servant said. Businesses have reportedly falsified staff attendance logs as well — they ""would rather waste a small amount of money on power than irritate local officials,"" Caixan writes.

In Wuhan, officials have tried to make it appear that recovery efforts are going smoothly. But when ""central leaders"" personally survey disinfecting regimens and food delivery, local officials ""make a special effort"" for them and them alone, one resident told Caixan. And in a video circulating on social media, residents can be seen shouting at visiting leaders from the apartments where they're being quarantined — ""Fake, it's all fake."""

> The time required for the virus titer to decrease 99.9% (T99.9) shows that in tap water, coronaviruses are inactivated faster in water at 23°C (10 days) than in water at 4°C ([100 days). Coronaviruses die off rapidly in wastewater, with T99.9 values of between 2 and 4 days. 

That means if you pee out Coronavirus it will be gone in 2-3 days in the wastewater system because all the other junk floating around is eating it up.

Only in clean cold tap water is it lasting so long because you’re practically cryofreezing it. It’s just like anything that would last longer in a fridge than in a counter.

On the import side, the decline prior to that date was driven by dry  bulk. Since then, he said, “dry bulk has mostly recovered, energy has  completely recovered and container imports may be higher than they were  before Chinese New Year,” with imports overall recovering “less than a  week” after the low was hit.

 On the export front, Chinese declines through Feb. 15 were driven by the  container sector. Since then, cargo categories including containers  have rebounded. “The recovery in exports was a little slower to  materialize but exports did return to the seasonally expected range by  the end of the month \[February\],” said Brutlag. 

He also noted that CargoMetrics is now analyzing the import and  export flows of other coronavirus hotspots including South Korea, Italy  and Iran. More good news: So far, “we haven’t seen any unusual trends,”  he reported.

**According to CargoMetrics CEO Scott Borgerson, “We’re seeing  improvements across the board. We’re seeing a complete rebound in every  segment — it’s all back. We don’t project our views onto the data. We  let the data talk to us. And what this data is saying is ‘keep calm and  carry on.’ Supply chains have reverted back to the mean. Things are  moving. So, people should just take a deep breath and they should not  get super-excited about what they read on the internet** — with the  exception of what they read in FreightWaves.”"

2020-03-06,TRFilune,Anxiety,7,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/eupik4/coronavirus_megathread/fjomg0g/,"Update 6: The media clown car has no brakes.

Hello, everybody! How's everyone doing today? Hopefully you all are doing okay so far, trying to survive the media barrage of the Coronavirus. Seriously, at this point, we can safely say that the media seems to be a worse threat to our mental sanity than any virus will be. Not even Ebola had this much attention, and I was grown up enough to worry about it!

As a note, I'm changing the title from days to 'Updates', because I might be busy in some days, and I might not be able to post daily updates to you folks. 

So, some updates from here. In the municipality, even if we're one of the municipalities with the most cases in Spain, its all chill and good. Stores are not being emptied out, bars are still open, and all sorts of things. It's something strange, you'd think Chaos would've taken over the town at this point. But overall, life is just still there. My dad and me are doing fine, enjoying the movies, or in my case, enjoying more video games. I am still keeping tabs with some of those friends I told you about, in order to keep tabs on the Virus while avoiding the mainstream media.  

Today I wanted to explore the reaction of the media to the Coronavirus. All I have to say is this: What an absolute dumpsterfire. The media coverage of this virus has been absolutely dreadful. We had the Taiwan News spreading the news of 'reinfection being more lethal', ignoring several concepts of how illness really works. This bullshit theory has been reblogged by sites like the New York Post, The Epoch Times, and now El Pais and El Mundo, here in Spain. The comments in those news were all panic clutching, including one person that I remember from that comment section, who spread all kinds of bullshit theories about this virus, and it worked. The comments were in a frenzy, and all kinds of logical discussion was out of the window. Social media also contributed to this in a very impactful degree.

How did this happen? How was this allowed to happen, overall? You can thank the current 'attention culture' that has dominated the late 2010's. For both old and new media, factual information is a deterrent to them. Instead, clickbait and scaremongering has been the norm, in order to gain all of the attention they could, while doing the least amount of effort possible. The news and social media refuse to give the people any good information about the virus, because they know that a scared person is easy to bring over and make them click on their headline, only to have bullshit be spoonfed upon them! And if that was not enough, some spanish clickbait outlets have started to twist NASA's news in order to create what I like to call 'Asteroid Hysteria'. Just this year, we had already 2 supposed 'NASA alerts' when it comes to Asteroids approaching Earth. NASA and The Asteroid Watch had to come out and say that their information was blatant bullshit, that the asteroids were not approaching Earth, that they were passing by, at 15-16 Lunar Distances away! In layman's terms, a fuckton of kilometers away from us! The media have become such a huge, corrupt and fear inducing cesspool, that if I had to fit them all in a car, I'd have to call the circus for a clown car! 

Forgive me for the rant, guys. My patience with the media has reached its limits, so for my own sanity, they've all been introduced to my personal blacklist. The media has failed on its last chance to be what they were supposed to be, and as such, it is up to people like you to keep digging the factual information sources, in order to avoid the sensationalism of the media.

Before I close the update, some personal recommendations: focus on digging the research about this virus, eat well, exercise, have a good drink with buddies. If the virus scares you, consult it with a psychologist. We are all scared about this, but I think that we can keep providing a more hopeful outlook on these bleak times. This virus is not a fight to preserve humanity, it is not the End Times, and it sure as shit is not looking like a 'population control' bioweapon. 

You people  are still as awesome as ever. If you guys want me to keep the updates going, I'll gladly do so. Overall, I'm just happy to be able to talk to you guys. Keep calm, and carry on!"

Even if what he is saying is true I don't see how immediately spraying the premises is considered "" NOT A SOUND RESPONSE PLAN "" I mean what do you want them to do go back in time and pick the person up earlier? Personally, I am impressed that they are spraying it down.

York Security being evasive with details makes sense because they obviously dont want to cause any unnecessary panic, York will send an email and update their COVID monitoring page with information when everything becomes available. Keep in mind this person has not yet been tested for COVID-19 and since the symptoms are very common, they could literally just have had the flu. How bad would it look if York Security went around saying 'Everyone get out someone has coronavirus' and then it comes out 2 days later that they did not actually have coronavirus...

No web news also makes sense because this literally happened less than a couple hours ago, York is not gonna put anything out until they get all the facts because again, what if they just had a typical flu.

TL;DR: Wash your hands as much as possible, sanitize if you cant wash, try not to hang around sick people, don't touch your face and **just generally be aware of the spread of germs. Coronavirus is not some Hollywood superbug, most people will end up just fine.**"

-  Fatality rate has varied widely in groups between 0.2% to 3.4% overall average.  For those over 60, who have asthma or smoke, have diabetes, are immunocompromised or have cardiovascular disease it is significantly higher.   That is only fatalities, the hospitalization rate is around 15-20% - more than enough to overwhelm the health care system for several months and shut down other routine health care procedures as hospitals enter pandemic mode.  Fatality and hospitalization rates are both higher than seasonal flu by at least 2x, possibly by 10x depending on risk groups.  There is no antiviral or vaccine to treat it yet, also unlike influenenza.

https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2020/02/14/805289669/how-covid-19-kills-the-new-coronavirus-disease-can-take-a-deadly-turn

- The disease can live on surfaces between 2-9 days.  We aren't sure yet exactly how long, but WHO confirmed it can be transmitted by cash. That is longer than flu virus can usually live on surfaces.

https://www.msn.com/en-ph/news/other/covid-19-virus-may-linger-on-surfaces-up-to-9-days-study-finds/ar-BB10iWjI

- The disease can be spread during a completely asymptomatic incubation period between 2-14 days, with one or two cases where it could be up to 24 days.  This is why community transmission cases are steadily popping up in every country even with quarantine orders.  It is very difficult to catch cases before they are symptomatic.  As an example, there are about 200 cases outside of Italy linked to travel to Italy during the time before anyone knew it was a travel risk to visit Italy.  

https://www.msn.com/en-nz/news/national/covid-19-cases-silent-transmission-could-already-be-happening-expert/ar-BB10KBMW?li=BBqdg4K

 These are facts, not meant to cause panic.  The most effective way to avoid spreading or catching Covid-19 is social distancing.  It is extremely effective to slow pandemics so that hospitals are not overwhelmed with patients all at once.  Social distancing is *very* effective and that is why working from home and closing large events is necessary.  That is the number one reason you should care - social distancing can prevent hospitals from being overwhelmed and having to shut down other aspects of normal operations to treat a pandemic.

https://www.totalhealth.co.uk/blog/covid-19-taking-social-distancing-seriously

You can compare cases by country as graphs here... Comparing South Korea and Japan to Italy will show that they have flatter curves for deaths caused by Covid-19 than Italy, possibly because they put social distancing into effect early because of prior experience with SARS. 

 That is certainly the case in Hong Kong, where despite relatively early reports of cases their growth curve remains very flat and stable:

There has been no evidence that this will happen. Many pandemics also follow a biphasic pattern, where there is an initial wave followed by a new one several months later. Hopefully this will not occur, but I think it's better to have a realistic outlook that this situation could be with us for some time.

Additionally, the economic effects of this (a) are real and (b) are just getting started.

>With any luck we will have a vaccine come next winter for the northern hemisphere, just in time for the flu season.

Yes - luck. That would mean having a vaccine tested, through trials and scaled up by October-November of this year (start of flu season). Note that there has never been a successful vaccine produced for a Coronavirus, so we are starting at ground zero.

What kind of boomer article is this thing.  It’s reads like it by somebody who is reporting on what they’ve used from somebody at the golf club locker room.  “Kids and their internet are making this common cold out to be something more than it is”

The WHO has said this is nearly a true pandemic.
Harvard epidemiologist are saying 20-60% infection rate, with around a 1-2% mortality.  
CNN is regularly the most linked news source on r/Coronavirus 

That’s 2 million people dead in America at a 30% infection rate.  That’s Harvard’s best guess.  But the reality is NOBODY knows.  So hope for best but plan for worst

Wanted to say thank you for everyone in this thread, it's seriously been a major relief. Like many others on here, I drove myself nuts on some of the other corona subs. For the better part of last week I had pretty debilitating anxiety over my coronavirus fears. As a generally anxious person, health anxiety has always been one of my particular triggers. Whether it be fears of cancer or other life-threatening diseases, I guess it's that complete lack of control with these diseases that can put me in a tailspin. Last week I didn't want to leave my house and felt like anything I touched made me instantly contaminated and was washing and sanitizing my hands constantly. Thanks to this thread helping me rationalize my thoughts, I've made a considerable bounce back and have been keeping most of my anxious thoughts at bay.   


This week has been way better mentally, but one thing that's conveniently bugging me now is I've actually started to feel somewhat sick. This week I've had a minor ""wet"" cough, some congestion, scratchy throat, etc.. but no fever, not particularly achy, not particularly fatigued (though aren't we all just a little too tired these days?). Here in the Southwest US we're already having highs in the 70s and 80s and getting into allergy season, which usually affects me, but is this different? Who knows. It does kind of feel like this is more of a cold than allergies at this point ..

 I guess one thing that's frustrating me is the lack of first-hand accounts of the virus. Any records of someone providing a day-by-day account? I hate feeling even remotely sick so I've been just trying to stay very hydrated and taking vitamins and elderberry. With that said I feel well enough where I intend to go bike a couple of miles after posting this.

All the news reports are saying ""80% of the cases are mild"" .. but what does mild mean? I know my symptoms don't really add up to what most records say, but I just feel most of the records are so generalized. As many on here have also said, I'm not really concerned about myself as a generally healthy person in their late 20s, but I am concerned about potentially spreading to some of the elderly people in my life, some of whom I work with. Quarantining myself on a hunch seems a bit unreasonable, right?"

And even then, they are not sharing important details that could prevent a very bad situation in this area.

We know that all the people who were on the Egypt trip have been back in Houston for @14 days now. Have they been out and about? To what stores? What restaurants? Any malls? Any other travel since then? What airport/airline did they fly? Do they have children that attend any of our schools? 

There is so much info they should be providing us so we can make decisions to keep our family and ourselves safe.

We cannot rely on the Gov't for reliable tests or info, I was hoping we could rely on our states and cities. NOPE.

I've talked to multiple media outlets. I've spoken to the local community officials. I knew 10 times more info than them and didn't know or or believe me that 2 of the coronavirus patients are in the hospital literally 3 minutes from them.

This is the biggest mess imaginable.

Buckle up, Texans. We are flying blind, on our own, and we have no idea what is happening. At all."

> ► Require all employers to provide an additional 14 days of paid sick leave, available immediately at the beginning of a public health emergency, including the current coronavirus crisis.

>► Ensure paid sick leave covers days when your child’s school is closed due to a public health emergency, when your employer is closed due to public health emergency, or if you or a family member is quarantined or isolated due to a public health emergency.

It definitely seems nice for employees, but that just moves the burden squarely onto employers..and we're talking about the service industry so those employers are already losing money if they're closed.

I'd wager that most restaurants can't afford to pay 14 days of Labor without those 14 days of Sales."

Even if in the future the voters decided that expenditure is worth it & agree to raise more revenue to cover that additional marginal cost, the government health departments don't know that currently.  So for now, the government agencies are working with finite financial resources.  

As a result, they need to use their manpower & money as efficiently as possible in the next several weeks/months to help as many people as possible.  For every extra $1,000 they spend on slighly swankier coronavirus housing (likely zero limited improvement in health outcomes, but it satisfies some NIMBYs politically), that would be $1,000 NOT available for some other item that is likely to be MUCH more effective in fighting this thing (extra/overtime pay for public health workers, boxes of protective gear used to protect critical front line workers, etc.)."

>Three key science conferences have been canceled in San Diego and the Salk Institute is temporarily banning visits by the public to help prevent the possible transmission of the coronavirus, which has killed at least 14 people across the country.
The cancellations include Experimental Biology 2020, which was scheduled to attract about 12,000 people to the San Diego Convention Center during its April 4-7 run. The group announced the cancellation on Friday.

> “Many institutions are enacting travel restrictions and quarantines, which would greatly impact people traveling to San Diego—as well as traveling home,” EB 2020 organizers said in a statement. “In light of these factors, it is clear that it would be a risk to bring so many people together in California next month.”

> EB pumped almost $42 million into San Diego’s economy when it held its convention here in 2018, convention center officials says.

> This year’s conference was scheduled to feature such prominent figures as Nobel laureate Randy Schekman, and Tony Hunter, a Salk researcher who has been instrumental in developing cancer drugs.

>Scripps Research in La Jolla canceled the Future of Individualized Medicine, an annual conference that was scheduled to be held on March 12 and 13 at UC San Diego’s Scripps Institution of Oceanography. The conference typically draws more than 300 people.

> “Given the rapidly evolving nature of the situation, we feel that out of an abundance of caution, canceling the event is the right decision,” Scripps Research said in a statement.

> UC San Diego canceled its Future of Experimental Technology conference, which was scheduled for March 13. The conference was meant to explore how artificial intelligence affects humans. The scheduled speakers included Hemanth Sampath, the leader of the 5G program at Qualcomm.

>Scripps Research also postponed its Front Row Lecture, a public forum that was scheduled for March 26. The forum features prominent scientists who talk to the public about emerging trends. The lecture will be rescheduled for July.

> The Salk Institute, which is across the street from UC San Diego, has closed its campus to the general public. Salk is widely considered to be an architectural gem and it typically draws many visitors.

> The Salk “receives tens of thousands of visitors from across the globe annually, most whom come to tour Louis Kahn’s architectural masterwork,” the institute said in a statement. “The closure does not apply to upcoming scientific meetings or events; however, we are evaluating this on a daily basis.”

> Some universities are canceling public lectures or limiting the number of people who can gather for meetings. UCSD said Friday that it currently doesn’t see the need to do the same.

> The San Diego Festival of Science & Engineering kicks off its week-long festivities on Saturday with an EXPO Day at Petco Park. The large family-friendly gathering, free to the public, is still going forward as planned, organizers said."

This is an absolutely indefensible position. Why would anything the US is doing lead us to believe that we will avoid this point? Why not start now, and give hospitals a fighting chance at managing case loads instead of contributing to a completely unmanageable surge of patients nationwide?

Is the economy so important that the only response we can stomach is taking a wild swing at r0 with [""expert advice""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mA1wqjaeKj0) and hoping for the best?

Tisk tisk H Town. 


/s Lol I’m just messing with you.The name of the game here is not really to prevent spread, but to delay or slow the rate at which every American gets it. Here in the US we only have 150,000 ICU beds, 60k ventilators, and 2-3 weeks of PPE reserves. Meaning if everyone rushes to the hospital nothing is going to work. The PPE shortage in the US has lead to a major MAJOR misinformation campaign telling the American populace that mask don’t work and are deadly dangerous, while stockpiling for medical professionals and VVIP’s.

Masks are not currently being shipped to stores. Particular industry sectors are having their orders fulfilled by distributors, however N95 masks and or respirators and or those that exceed that rating are controlled items in the US by order of the government. Non approved industry/general public stores are having their orders put on “back order” until the governments goal of stockpiling 500 million masks is met. Last I heard the stockpile was up to 60 million. General public will not see masks on store shelves until the 500 million stockpile is met. If you don’t believe me call an industry supplier. I called Grainer.

Also, masks are required and can save your life! When the virus is caught intrnasally (via nose) it allows for quick blood brain barrier passage and the virus replicates and stays by the brain stem. Infections where the virus is caught via facal-oral or conjunctival route will be lighter than those infected Intranasally.

Masks will be absolutely required!

This section implies that coronavirus may be life threatening for infants, or that infants are at greater risk. I’m not aware of any scientific or medical report that would support this position.

It's equally important, though, to understand the scope and weight of age-related cognitive decline. I commented this on the original thread, but it's worth repeating.

There are two charts that strike me as central here:

1. [Age-related cognitive decline](https://steemitimages.com/p/3MxaK27PJLaXTye38LFsNXRdyNJyo2d31RkBW76F5bGGbPU) ([source paper](https://sharepoint.washington.edu/uwsom/sls/Documents/1990/course_adlt_intell_dev.pdf))

2. [Global age distribution of CEOs](https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/http%3A%2F%2Fblogs.ft.com%2Fftdata%2Ffiles%2F2015%2F09%2FGM110915X-Blog-CEO-ages.png?fit=scale-down&source=next&width=600). 

Seriously, people should take a look at particularly that first chart to make sure they understand just how significant the average decline is. My worry is that because it's an uncomfortable topic, people have not collectively absorbed just how much these cognitive skills decline with normal aging. Maintenance helps, to be clear, but even [the research focusing on that maintenance is couched carefully](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1364661312000836):

> Some individuals may show reliable decline as early as in their 50s. Conversely, and of main concern here, others may show **relatively** preserved memory functioning well into their 70s. [emphasis mine]

I include the chart of CEOs because they have a strong motive both to remain in control of their own companies and to make a profit, and the job of a CEO is probably as close as you're going to get to president with a large enough sample size to properly analyze. Like with presidents, they need charisma and connections in addition to raw skill. It's notable, then, that so few of them stay on through their 70s and 80s. 

Obviously the idea of the mental decline isn't earth-shattering news. Everyone knows it, to some degree and on some level. But I'm not sure people realize just how inevitable and how significant the decline is. I think it should be more of a focus in that conversation, not just for them, but for the [Senate and House members whose average age is steadily rising](https://www.quorum.us/data-driven-insights/the-115th-congress-is-among-the-oldest-in-history/175/). From my angle, it shouldn't just be mentioned a few times among a slew of other coverage. It should be central in the conversation.

The US is going to elect one of those three men, barring a black swan (coronavirus, perhaps? An unfortunate time to have a pandemic threat) swooping in. Given that, it strikes me as important to go in with our eyes wide open, understanding fully that no matter who is in the White House in 2020, no matter how brilliant, talented, or capable they were and are, it is almost certain that their perpetual speed, inductive reasoning, spatial orientation, and memory will all be well below their own lifetime peaks. When we choose to set age aside in favor of other concerns, we are knowingly electing people well past their mental peaks, people who are likely to be more capable right now than they will *ever* be in the future. 

Biden doesn't have dementia. Neither do the other two. It's too late to elect someone younger this cycle, so for a rare moment this isn't a partisan issue or something that favors one candidate over the others. But the declines are more than a minor blip, and I don't think it's ageist to talk candidly about that."
2020-03-06,ContentRisk,ucla,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/ucla/comments/feiymb/coronavirus_spread/fjoee97/,"This is a huge concern for me as well. I am considering not going home for the break because I have very old family members (80+). The fucking death rate for people that old who’ve contracted coronavirus is nearly 15%. That’s not even considering the health conditions that my elderly family members have. I would not be surprised if it were much greater for the conditions that they have (diabetes, high blood pressure). If this keeps up, I don’t know if I’ll feel safe going home to my family and potentially putting them in an enormous level of danger. Ffs if the death rate for college-aged students were 15%, I’m sure UCLA would be flipping their shit right now with the testing going on, but they’re not, because the death rate for college-aged individuals is 0.2%. I was skeptical about canceling classes at first. But now that I know how extremely contagious and potentially devastating it can be to my family and others like mine, I feel that UCLA is doing the student body a massive disservice by not canceling all classes immediately until a proper way to deal with this has come forth. Experts know that this disease is practically impossible to contain in a normal environment. Keeping students in cramped lecture halls with 100-200+ people is just asking for a disease exponentiate. A lot of students here have older family members and the longer UCLA waits to take drastic measures, the more risk that these families are placed in. Maybe this is an overreaction, but either way, I don’t like the direction that this is headed

I go to a large public university that's majority commuter, and even though I live on campus, I've been driving between campus and home (only 30 minutes away) this week because I'm registered to vote in my hometown, my mom's birthday was on Wednesday, and the family car was only available at certain times. I finally arrived back on campus on Thursday and decided I would stay through Saturday, when I would go back home for spring break. I've been falling behind on my work this semester, and so I had to sit down yesterday and make myself work.

A while after supper, one of my suitemates, who had apparently gone to New York without my noticing, comes back *with a cough and wearing a face mask*.

I have Crohn's Disease, and I am on three (3) medications that suppress my immune system so it doesn't cut my intestines in half. I am in one of the highest risk categories for both catching and dying of coronavirus.

I went to task on him, asking him why he came back if he could have coronavirus. He insisted that he didn't, and that he only had ""a flu-like virus"", because he went to the hospital, and they would have quarantined him if they suspected coronavirus. (LOL.) Even though I told him about my Crohn's medications at the beginning of the semester, it still took him a good minute to figure out my immune system was compromised. Thankfully, my suite's not very social and we don't share a bedroom, so I've been able to avoid him for the most part, and I hold my breath when I walk past him.

I told my mom about it today, rather than yesterday, because I felt like I couldn't afford to miss my classes today. Understandably, she was upset, and she told me to come home today. I wanted to go to the hockey game (hockey is huge at my university, and it's the last game of the regular season), but I totally get it. I just want to get out of here. I still have a three hour lab (I'm on lunch hour right now) before I can come home, which I can't miss because my last lab report was a disaster.

I'm so mad at my suitemate. I'm honestly considering reporting him to health services. Can they do anything - or at least scare him into going home while he's sick?"

On one hand I'm glad two people got tested without having to be on deaths door first. On the other hand I think we're going to see numbers growing rapidly what with Denver being a major destination and hub.

Prior to 2008, there were mild recessions in 2001 and 1991. The recessions of the late 1970s were due to structural factors that could repeat (like an energy crisis or in the wake of Coronavirus, supply chain interruptions already cropping up), but prior to the stagflation era, mild recessions were relatively common post-WWII.

That's not making the case that economic conditions are equivalent to any prior time period, but that not every downturn has to be a repeat of the worst one seen in 80 years. Though 2008 is still fresh in a lot of minds and the factors associated with a Coronavirus-caused recession seem potentially serious, if the growth in the economy has been substantive and real (I guess that's the hinging if), then a recession may not be as damaging as 2008.

What *is* worrisome, is that all the levers for responding to a recession involve pumping government cash into the economy and expanding social services, and given the current budget deficits... well, you know."

If there are other companies that are doing things for the health of employees that we as workers believe is appropriate for the occasion but our company is not following suit, we absolutely should be talking about it.

Our grandparents and great grandparents generations literally fought wars against corporations for the right to take lunch breaks, have overtime laws, and basic care like sick leave. Corporations are, by default, entities that will continue to attempt to cut whatever they can get away with to make more money. They will continue to take away your rights, shave them little by little, so slowly you don't feel it, or move the goalpost in a way that makes you think you're being fairly treated when you're not.

Talking about it, surprisingly, is one of the most effective mitigators we have against this phenomenon.

I personally think coronavirus is blown out of proportion by media scare. But I also saw that Best Buy closed their corporate offices in Seattle for ""safety"" while keeping their store fronts open.

2020-03-06,passportsizephoto,finance,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/finance/comments/fekmm3/black_swan_fund_universa_made_huge_gains_in/fjowecb/,"Full text: 

Imagine that an investor knew back in early December that a deadly coronavirus was spreading in Wuhan, China, that could become a pandemic. Or imagine that he at least heard and heeded the warning by the tragically muzzled Dr. Li Wenliang at the end of that month.

Acting on that information by, say, shorting the highflying Nasdaq Composite might have sounded like a good idea, but the results would have been disastrous. By the time the index hit its intraday record on Feb. 19, a forewarned investor would have trailed that index by about 30 and 20 percentage points, respectively.

Yet one fund that makes its living protecting portfolios from such events may have reaped a bonanza in February without such insights. Universa, managed by Mark Spitznagel, a protégé of “The Black Swan: The Impact of the Highly Improbable” author Nassim Nicholas Taleb, managed a little over $4 billion in assets as of the end of 2018. Claude Bovet, founder of Lionscrest Capital and a long time investor in the fund, estimates that Universa’s tail risk hedging strategy, representing part of its capital, earned more than 1,000% in a matter of days.

“It was a great month for us,” says Mr. Spitznagel, who declined to disclose a dollar figure on those gains. He did point out, though, that the fund’s positions are “convex to the market.” In other words, its strategy of using options and similar instruments can register profits that escalate in much more than a linear fashion, suggesting a handsome payoff indeed. Back in August 2015 the fund made over $1 billion, or 20%, in a single day when the Dow had what was then its largest ever intraday plunge of over 1,000 points, ending down by 588 points.

The index lost 3,583 points last week—its worst such period since the financial crisis and sharpest ever drop from a peak. Yet, even as patients were succumbing to the illness in Wuhan, the cost of placing bets in the run-up to the selloff was extremely low as represented by the Cboe Volatility Index, or VIX. The so-called fear gauge, it represents the cost of purchasing options as expressed by the implied volatility embedded in their prices.

Universa hedged without timing the market or taking a risk, which holds a lesson about risk, reward and complacency. While many reasonable investors were tempted to sell tech stocks or bet against them—2,000 people had died by the day they peaked—Universa ignored the headlines and focused only on what the numbers said. They told it that insurance was cheap.

“If you have a position that can lose 1 to make 100, like Universa’s tail hedge at any point in time, you don’t care about your timing of a market crash, you just don’t want to miss it,” says Mr. Spitznagel.

Buying protection in such a fund is akin to purchasing insurance from an optimistic underwriter—writing small monthly checks and very rarely receiving a big one in return. Returns can be negative for years. Yet even during a mostly excellent run for U.S. stocks, the strategy trounced the stock market in its first 10 years through February 2018, according to a leaked client letter.

Mr. Spitznagel, who acknowledges spending all of his time “thinking about looming disaster,” expressed no view on what the impact of the Covid-19 epidemic might now be on stock prices.

Even so, his advice to those with a bearish inclination is hardly uplifting: “For people who are worried about having missed it, this selloff has only taken back a few months of gains. I expect a true crash to take back a decade.”"

do not need to be hospitalized should stay home. Please do not refer a patient to an Emergency 
Department simply for testing purposes.
At this time, the CT DPH is prioritizing testing for patients admitted to an acute care hospital with 
severe acute lower respiratory disease. The DPH Laboratory will provide this support until our acute 
care hospitals until they are able to conduct SARS-CoV-2 testing onsite.
• Hospital clinicians should consider clinical presentation when making the decision to test: 
https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/clinical-guidance-management-patients.html
• Influenza PCR and Respiratory Viral Panel (RVP) testing should be done, if available. You do not 
need to wait for the results of the RVP before calling DPH. 
• Report a possible PUI and request SARS-CoV-2 testing at the CT Public Health Laboratory by calling 
the DPH Epidemiology Program at 860-509-7994 (weekdays 8:30a–4:30p). After-hours/weekends 
call 860-509-8000.
• Submit respiratory specimens according to guidelines: https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-
nCoV/lab/guidelines-clinical-specimens.html
• SARS-CoV-2 PCR testing turnaround time is 24–48 hours from specimen arrival.
Transfer of PUI: Before transferring a PUI, please call the receiving facility ahead of time so appropriate 
PPE and preparations can be made. Please also notify the EMS provider of PUI status.
Recommendations for Travelers from Countries with Transmission: Travelers from countries with CDC 
Travel Health Notice Level 3 should stay at home for 14 days from the time of leaving the area affected.

""Dear Students,

As of this writing, there are no reported cases of Coronavirus (COVID-19) on the Davis campus or in [Yolo County](https://www.yolocounty.org/health-human-services/adults/communicable-disease-investigation-and-control/coronavirus). Nevertheless, in the interests of health and safety, the campus is preparing for all scenarios, including the possibility that students, staff or instructors become ill or are under quarantine in the coming weeks and months, or the campus needs to temporarily suspend in-person instruction. We will continue to provide updates about this evolving situation at the [UC Davis Coronavirus (COVID-19) information page](https://www.ucdavis.edu/health/pandemics/coronavirus/news/coronavirus-information-uc-davis-campus).

Our primary focus is the health and safety of our UC Davis community. In addition, we want to uphold the quality of education so you can continue progress towards your academic goals.

**Maintaining Academic Instruction in Case of Emergency**  
The Office of Provost has provided advice and resources to our Deans, faculty and academic staff for maintaining instructional continuity during the winter 2020 and spring 2020 courses, should local public health officials advise that we limit time spent in close physical proximity to each other. Those resources include:

* Support for remote instruction
* Access to grading records and course documents online
* Alternate arrangements for assessment and exams

Additionally, the Academic Senate is preparing emergency academic policies should longer-term disruptions to campus operating status occur, and we will continue to work with campus leaders to develop resources that will support instructional resilience into the future.

**Stay Healthy and Practice the Principles of Community**  
As always, it is important to follow simple precautions to stay healthy, including:

* Wash your hands frequently with soap and water
* Avoid touching your eyes, nose or mouth
* Clean and disinfect frequently touched surfaces at home, work or school
* Practice healthy habits: get plenty of sleep, be physically active, manage your stress, drink plenty of fluids and eat nutritious food

As we focus on self-care, we also ask that you [remain mindful of how we care for each other](https://studentaffairs.ucdavis.edu/news/joint-statement-division-student-affairs-and-office-diversity-equity-and-inclusion-principles) and the guiding values of our [Principles of Community](https://diversity.ucdavis.edu/principles-community).

It is essential that we are as prepared as possible, while hoping that our precautions will prove to be unnecessary. In these times of uncertainty and concern, we thank you for your cooperation and support in protecting the UC Davis community."""

I've been following along to this subreddit, trying to get facts and not succumb to hysteria. With the news wanting big stories, that's hard to do.

So just today at work, I was in a LARGE hospital (largest hospital in several states, with a cancer center, full heart institute, full pediatric center, you get the idea) for a meeting.

We walked through many parts of the hospital, from the main entrance, staff/admin areas, through patient areas and even through the basement and mechanical/electrical service areas.

One guy made a joke about ""corona and lime"" like no one has heard that joke before. \*eye roll\*

&#x200B;

\*\*We were all in a big circle, talking, and this other guy, who is a fairly high level project manager, pulls out a tissue and blows his nose right in front of us. He digs it into his nostrils and pushes it around (to get all the mucous???) It was LOUD and disgusting. He puts the tissue back into his pocket, then with his RIGHT hand, rubs his nose a few times and sniffs loudly.\*\*

&#x200B;

He shook a few hands after that, and was walking around, opening doors, touching elevator buttons, using his phone.

&#x200B;

Meanwhile, since I've interfaced with the healthcare industry a long time (but not a doctor or nurse) I'm in the habit of 'foam in/foam out' like entering and leaving a patient room. Basically, at the hospital, every time I pass a Purell foam station, you bet I get two squirts of foam and rub my hands together.

&#x200B;

One person in our group looked at me and tried making a joke about me being paranoid about getting sick. I just said ""meh, I spend time in hospitals, so it's a habit."" Meanwhile, I'm thinking: ""Some dude in our group just blew his nose and rubbed his snot on his hand, and has been touching surfaces, AND you shook his hand! And there are sick people all around us, some with masks, in this enormous hospital that takes up many city blocks. And you think I'm silly for using hand sanitizer?""

&#x200B;

If people could just wash their hands, cover when they cough and sneeze, and use sanitizer like they should, not only would coronavirus die out, but there wouldn't be such a big problem with the flu, colds and other such illness.

&#x200B;

... Just wanted to vent. I was disgusted at the guy who blew his nose like that, in front of all of us, in a HOSPITAL, with sick people around..."

Fear leads to action to stop the danger.

Panic leads to the wrong action or worse, paralysis.

I do believe Trump panicked about Coronavirus. His fear led him to the falsehood that this virus is like the cold, just like he convinced himself that climate change is a hoax. In both cases Panic is paralysis, normally this panicky reaction would be stopped by experts in the administration, but the emperor is naked.

Testing is the first and most important tool in understanding the epidemiology of a disease outbreak. In the United States, a series of failures has combined with the decentralized nature of our health-care system to handicap the nation’s ability to see the severity of the outbreak in hard numbers.

Today, more than a week after the country’s first case of community transmission, the most significant finding about the coronavirus’s spread in the United States has come from an independent genetic study, not from field data collected by the government. And no state or city has banned large gatherings or implemented the type of aggressive “social distancing” policies employed to battle the virus in Italy, Hong Kong, and other affluent places.

If the true extent of the outbreak were known through testing, the American situation would look worse. But health-care officials and providers would be better positioned to combat the virus. Hard decisions require data. For now, state and local governments don’t have the information they need.”"

“Minnesota reported its first case today of COVID-19, a respiratory illness caused by a novel coronavirus that emerged in China in December and swept across the globe.

State health officials had viewed the case as an inevitability following reports in late February that the coronavirus was spreading from person-to-person in the western U.S. The likelihood of a positive case increased after March 2, when the Minnesota Department of Health started testing on its own for the virus. At least 36 prior samples from suspect cases in the state had been negative.

The patient is an older Ramsey County resident who had been on a cruise ship with a known COVID-19 case. The unidentified person sought health care yesterday after developing symptoms on Feb. 25, according to the Health Department.”"

So far, NY, CA, and WA are requiring insurers to cover costs, and WI will likely follow suit if there is an outbreak here. On the federal level, Medicare and Medicaid cover the tests. Aetna and Cigna have confirmed they are waiving copays and deductibles. 

From the board of America’s Health Insurance Plans, which includes Blue Cross and other major insurers: 

> We will cover needed diagnostic testing when ordered by a physician. We will take action to ease network, referral, and prior authorization requirements and/or waive patient cost sharing. We will also take action so that patients will have continuous access to their regular prescription medications while at the same time avoiding potential problems such as drug shortages.

However, infections by this disease happen much more quickly than the flu spreads, and local healthcare providers quickly become overwhelmed.  This necessitates extreme restrictions on personal movements in order to slow the spread of the disease.  When such measures are taken, the economy is affected by lack of purchases and lack of wages.  The true cost of the virus, then, is only the equivalent of doubling normal flu deaths, and the economic losses caused by quarantine.  Knowing this, local leaders are unlikely to undertake the aforementioned quarantine measures.  There's no specific treatment for the coronavirus, and a quarantine would affect a great many more people, possibly making a huge number homeless.  I think that we'll probably see a stadium turned into a makeshift hospital at some point, but no mandatory quarantine for the general public.  This disease just isn't bad enough to warrant it."

The three new cases were from South and Mid Placer and all traveled on the Grand Princess cruise ship from San Francisco to Mexico Feb. 11-21. Two had mild symptoms that have already resolved; the third currently has mild symptoms. All three are isolated at home and none required hospitalization.

Placer County Public Health is in the initial stages of contact investigations for these passengers to identify any potential exposures that may have occurred in the window of concern.

“We are moving as quickly as possible to limit the spread of disease,” said Health Officer Dr. Aimee Sisson. “To be frank, we would not be surprised to see a second wave of cases connected to these cruise passengers given the amount of time that’s passed since they disembarked.”

Placer County Public Health contacted all cruise passengers in the Placer jurisdiction after receiving a list from the cruise company on Wednesday and all are in quarantine through Friday, March 6; that is, 14 days since disembarking. Those exhibiting or who have exhibited any symptoms of illness are being tested and additional results are expected in the coming days. Going forward, updated case numbers will be posted to [www.placer.ca.gov/coronavirus](http://www.placer.ca.gov/coronavirus) on a regular basis."

2020-03-06,Tessablu,boston,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/boston/comments/feghog/breaking_the_first_confirmed_coronavirus_case_in/fjoi2an/,"Just a quick note- this viral infection more closely resembles pneumonia than the flu, cold, or allergies. It is primarily a lower respiratory infection with the main symptoms being persistent fever and dry cough or difficulty breathing. These are the only symptoms [listed](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/about/symptoms.html) by the CDC. Thus far, upper respiratory symptoms like stuffy head, sore throat, and runny nose are not considered indicative of the disease.

Hopefully that makes you and others feel better. It's good that we're all closely monitoring our health, but if people start to worry too much about cold or flu symptoms it may tie up already strained medical resources."

This is why we asked for greater coordination in Europe"". At the end of the second extraordinary summit of EU health ministers on coronavirus, we are still appealing, like the one launched yesterday by Roberto Speranza leaving Brussels. Indeed, health is a matter of national competence and the goodwill of the European institutions is often not enough to move governments.

As in the case of masks: last week Italy asked the partners for help to cover the needs of our country in the eye of the hurricane, but in a situation where the virus is spreading across the continent, no EU capital has been made come on. Now the European Commission will seek a solution. Moreover, through informal channels it has already made it known to our government that the 6.3 billion of expenses to combat Covid-19 and its impact on the economy thanks to flexibility will be sterilized for the purposes of the deficit and debt account.

During yesterday's summit, EU health ministers gave up on handshakes, choosing to greet each other by beating their elbows. At the end of the work, the Commission said: ""This is the moment of global solidarity and within the member states, only by walking hand in hand could we give the most effective response to this crisis"". But it is not easy, as the templates show, an emblematic case of the difficulty of common management. ""These devices must be moved to the places where they are most needed"", the EU Commissioner for Crisis Management, Janez Lenarcic, hoped yesterday.

But, as mentioned, no EU government responded to the Italian request made on February 27th. Not only that, yesterday France and Germany - increasingly affected by the virus - notified Brussels that they will block the export of masks to other countries, keeping them for national use. A freeze on the free movement of goods in emergencies allowed by the European Treaties.

The French however denied forms of protectionism and the Germans with Minister Jens Spahn explained: ""We do not ban exports, but authorization from the authorities is needed. If it concerns an EU country or an international organization, it is more likely to obtain it""

On 27 February, soon after they they had received clearance to use it, their ‘COVID panel’ detected the virus in a swab from a teenager north of Seattle.

Scroll down to the section called “Growth: The doubling time of COVID-19 cases.” 

https://ourworldindata.org/coronavirus

Basically it’s exponential: they look at how long it takes for the number of cases to double. But exponential growth is pretty hard for us to estimate/guesstimate or even comprehend once we’re into the hundreds. 

So if a country is testing *everyone* and captures a full set of correct data (number of infected, recovered, and dead), we’re way better off than the current shitshow where the U.S. is failing to test, failing to report numbers, and failing to prepare or help us prepare (Edit, I meant help us to prepare ourselves.) 

I’m not a doom-and-gloom, apocalypse type,  but just based on the numbers being reported by South Korea, Italy, Japan, and even China, we can reasonably assume that the current number of infections in the U.S. is vastly off-base and more widespread than the official numbers."

They drug their feet on testing, then went “oh shit we better do something” after I came back positive. The real kicker, when I got a positive result, they panic called me saying “you are contagious for 2 weeks after you show symptoms. Don’t go outside, wear long sleeves, and bug spray”.

Today's results is a further increase of [4 new positive cases] (https://news.ontario.ca/mohltc/en/2020/03/ontario-confirms-new-positive-cases-of-covid-19-4.html), bringing us to a total of 22 positive cases now. 

The first two cases of today is a husband and wife who are both in their 60s. They recently traveled aboard the Grand Princess cruise ship out of San Francisco which traveled to Mexico. They were presented at Trillium Health Partners - Mississauga Hospital and are both now in self-isolation. 

The third is a man in his 50s who recently returned from Iran and presented himself to North York General Hospital. He is now in self-isolation. The last case is a man in his 40s who came back from Las Vegas and was presented at Toronto Western Hospital. This makes him the first case we've had from the US (if you discount the couple from above since they were technically in Mexico, otherwise they're the first).

News flash, if you're panicking because everyone around you is selling, then you're already too late, and you're acting out of fear.

Buy and hold investing is exactly what it means. You buy once and you hold through the good times and the bad. This time is not different. This isn't the end of an era or the end of the world.

“Serology Test for COVID-19

CDC is working to develop a new laboratory test to assist with efforts to determine how much of the U.S. population has been exposed to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the virus that causes COVID-19.

The serology test will look for the presence of antibodies, which are specific proteins made in response to infections.  Antibodies can be found in the blood and in other tissues of those who are tested after infection.  The antibodies detected by this test indicate that a person had an immune response to SARS-CoV-2, whether symptoms developed from infection or the infection was asymptomatic.  Antibody test results are important in detecting infections with few or no symptoms.“"

“Patients with diabetes often have complications involving the heart, but also the kidneys, and in the same way any extra strain on the body from the infection can cause secondary problems in those organs. Furthermore, we know that diabetics’ immune systems are not quite as good as fighting infections as non-diabetics,” added Cohen.
“Coronavirus can cause more severe symptoms and complications in people with diabetes. If you have diabetes and you have symptoms such as cough, high temperature and feeling short of breath you need to monitor your blood sugar closely and call NHS 111,” said Dan Howarth, the head of care at Diabetes UK.
The risk to patients in both groups depends on each person’s health, such as how long they have had their illness, how often they suffer complications.

Since we have been comparing to the flu: the incubation period for the flu is 1-4 days. That means we can catch it early, before we can spread it around to our peers. That is not the case for coronavirus, so a new case in a new city must be taken very seriously.

Universities host conferences, have international students, and have daily visitors from out of state. Basically universities are hubs for spreading disease to new places. If CU Boulder is at the brink of an outbreak, it must be shut down.

2020-03-06,anUnfortunateGirl,Coronavirus,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/femrzy/maryland_governor_says_coronavirus_patients_had/fjp1q7l/,"BREAKING: Gov. Larry Hogan (R) said Friday that the Montgomery County residents who contracted coronavirus later attended events that involved schoolchildren in suburban Philadelphia and a Rockville retirement community, where up to 100 people could have been exposed to the virus.

Hogan also said the patients contracted the virus on an Egyptian cruise on the Nile River.

  The governor has declared a state of emergency to speed the delivery of funding and other resources to address the virus.

This is a developing story. It will be updated.

Original story is below:

Maryland health officials have launched a search for other people potentially infected with coronavirus, after three Montgomery County residents were found to have contracted the virus while traveling overseas.

County health workers are doing most of the work to track down anyone who might have come in contact with the three patients — a husband and wife in their 70s and a woman in her 50s.

AD

“It’s a lot of phone calls and left messages and ‘please call me back,’ ” said Assistant Maryland Health Secretary Dr. Jinlene Chan, whose agency is overseeing the statewide effort.

So far, she said, no one identified as potentially exposed has displayed symptoms that warrant testing, and there has been no evidence of transmission within the community.

“We knew this was coming,” Chan said of the three cases, adding that the focus right now is “about trying to contain it.”

The Montgomery County victims returned to Maryland from a cruise on Feb. 20, officials say. They experienced flu-like symptoms and sought medical treatment.

But they were not tested for covid-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus, for nearly two weeks, because at the time of their return, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommended tests only for people who had been traveling in China, Montgomery County Health Officer Travis Gayles said.

AD

Officials declined to say where the three had been traveling but said they did not meet those testing guidelines.

Maryland received its first shipment of test kits last week, and the state lab in Baltimore has been running two batches of tests a day, seven days a week.

Right now, Chan said, testing is limited. But that could change if the state’s caseload increases or community transmissions are detected. Private labs, and possibly some hospital labs, are preparing to start administering testing as well.

She said the state’s health department is fielding calls from physicians, residents and patients, all trying to determine which symptoms warrant testing.

“This is changing so quickly,” Chan said. “The guidance we provide right now might change, and that’s based on what’s changing on the ground.”

Maryland official says ‘no need to panic’ after 3 cases of confirmed coronavirus

Montgomery County Executive Marc Elrich (D) urged people to avoid sick people on March 6 after three cases of the coronavirus were confirmed in Maryland. (Montgomery County Government)
Sen. Ben Cardin (D-Md.), who toured the National Institutes of Health vaccine research center in Bethesda Friday afternoon, said test kits are being transported to private labs across the country, which should significantly expand the ability to test potential patients.

“It will reimbursable under Medicare, it will be reimbursable under Medicaid,” he said. “We want to make this an essential health benefit.”

Maryland has received $500 million from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to help stem the outbreak, said Sen. Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.), who also toured NIH.

“We’re all confident that given the passage of the $8.3 billion, the resources will flow to Maryland and other places that need it,” he said referring to a federal funding package signed by President Trump.

The three Montgomery County patients with covid-19 are “in good condition,” Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan (R) said Thursday night. They are quarantined in their homes in the county, a large and affluent suburb of about 1 million people just outside Washington.

AD

The woman is not related to the couple; they were on the same trip, officials said, but were not traveling as a group.

Maryland officials said the state contacted the three earlier this week, after learning from the CDC that they were on a trip that included exposure to the coronavirus.

At a news conference Friday morning, Montgomery County Executive Marc Elrich (D) urged residents to stay calm and said the state and county had been working for weeks to prepare for a possible outbreak.

“There is no reason to panic,” Elrich said. “Life as you know it should continue pretty much as it was.”

Gayles said there is no reason at this point to consider any widespread closures of schools, offices or other institutions in the county. Rather, he said, people who feel sick should stay home, and everyone should take basic precautions like washing their hands using hand sanitizer, and avoiding contact with those who are ill.

Hogan has declared a state of emergency to speed the delivery of funding and other resources to address the virus.

As of Friday morning, 41 Maryland residents had been tested for the coronavirus. Twenty-six of the tests were negative, according to the Maryland Department of Health. Twelve were pending. The only three positive tests were the Montgomery County residents.

State and county health officials are trying to determine who else may have been exposed in the days between the victims’ arrival home and when they were tested. They want to clarify exactly where the victims were, “how they came back here and what they’ve been doing since they’ve been back,” Elrich said.

Gayles said state investigators have conducted in-depth interviews known as “contact tracing” with all three patients, In general, such interviews are conducted either over the phone, via video link or in-person, with the investigators wearing protective gear.

Officials try to map out where a person traveled to before being quarantined, who they came into contact with, and what that “quality of interaction” was, Gayles said, taking into account factors like whether they were physically proximate and whether they hugged or shared food.

Each person who had contact with a coronavirus victim is then assigned a risk level, and depending on that assessment, health officials may then decide to do another level of contact tracing.

State and local officials have released very few details about the Montgomery County patients. Hogan spokesman Michael Ricci said he “can’t stress this enough: the patients have asked for privacy. We have to balance that against providing the information necessary to protect public health.”

All three individuals had limited their external interaction leading up to their quarantine because they were not feeling well, Gayles said. They had not been to work, for example. It was not immediately clear how many additional people were considered at-risk and assigned for follow-up contact. The patients are not believed to have had significant contact with children, officials said.

No cases of the coronavirus have been diagnosed in Virginia or the District.

Thirty-one Virginia residents have been tested for coronavirus as of Friday, including 21 whose tests came back negative and 10 that are pending. Three of the pending cases are in Northern Virginia. Nine D.C. residents have been tested; eight tests came back negative, while one is pending.

Metro moved into the second phase of its pandemic response to the coronavirus threat on Friday, canceling non-essential business travel and providing hand sanitizer to frontline employees such as Metrobus operators, a Metro spokesman said.

The system activated its pandemic task force, including transit police and emergency management, in January and ordereddaily wiping down of heavy traffic areas and steering wheels of Metrobuses and ensuring rail cars go through a hospital-level disinfectant process weekly.

The task force also began monitoring absenteeism to look for patterns that might indicate a rash of illness.

In Maryland, the General Assembly has fast-tracked a request from Hogan to access $50 million from the state’s rainy day fund to deal with the coronavirus. The Senate unanimously approved the request on Friday, and the House was expected to vote later in the day. Hogan also submitted a supplemental budget request for fiscal 2021 that would allocate $10 million in emergency expenses to prepare for the coronavirus.

Attorney General Brian E. Frosh (D) warned Maryland residents about scams involving the virus. Frosh said scammers are setting up websites to sell “bogus health products that claim to prevent or cure covid-19.” They are also sending fake emails, texts and social media posts to steal money and personal information, posing as the CDC and the World Health Organization.

Frosh recommended that residents contact his office’s Consumer Protection Division or reporting it to WHO.

He also ate lunch in Bellevue. Right now he’s sick with a mild cold, but because of where he’s been I think he may have contracted COVID already. It’s very mild so nobody cares. He hasn’t been tested and we aren’t under a quarantine. 

I called the health department and told them that we had a suspected coronavirus case AND my husband works with an at-risk population. He’s in the military and is a medic, so he works all day with people who live in a dorm. I was on hold for an hour and then the call was dropped. I went over to the base emergency department and the nurse working there asked if we’d been to China. When I said no, she literally rolled her eyes at me. Said he was negative then, and to stop watching the news. 

I’m sure I’m not the only one with a similar story. I was an army medic too so I get it; you don’t have the resources to test every nervous military kid. But JBLM is an hour from Seattle and has a huge number of soldiers and airmen living in dormitories. When I was active I got a cold and developed pneumonia just from how closely and austerely we lived. JBLM should be testing, full stop, but they aren’t even advising families with potential cases to quarantine. So when a US solider inevitably contracts COVID and dies from complications, I hope everybody knows they could have prevented this and actively chose not to."

That's a hell of a sideways comment to drop into a CNBC interview about the stock market.

Strikes me that he is massively in denial about how this virus gets transmitted and what the likely infection levels really are around the country. This White House appears to be massively in denial about the whole situation.

Then he went off on a tangent about how it's not so bad anywhere else so people should go to work, and that there's medicines coming as early as this spring. Which to the best of my limited Redditor knowledge, is utter nonsense and not at all true. This guy should not be allowed to address the public about coronavirus.

I'm honestly scared because she needs to go outside to buy food or see her doctor for Arthritis.  My school district recently sent out an E-Mail to students, teachers, and parents explaining that the district is ready to protect students, but something they said really caught me off-guard and made me angry.  In the E-Mail, they said that even if you're infected, if you show no symptoms you aren't infectious; therefore you can go to school. I may be wrong, but even if you're asymptomatic you can still be a vector for transmission, and you shouldn't go anywhere.

[*Some days after?*]

**OP**: Sounds like it could help in inactivating viruses that are then used in vaccines. Not sure how everyday people could use it to fight the virus though, besides as a disinfectant/cleaning product. I know you have ingested before and believe in it but be careful [*CBS News link to an article ""the dangers of drinking peroxide as a natural cure"".*]

**Mother**: You can ingest H202 safely and the only reason I stopped doing it because of the taste with the corona virus  
going around I'm back on the bandwagon

[*EarthClinic article link about inhalation of hydrogen peroxide.*]

Take the time to read this

[*Link to a ""The Big Peroxide"" Compounder article.*]

Please read

[*Link to a Frequency Rising page about hydrogen peroxide.*]

Last one

**OP**: Just be careful is all I said. And if you have any adverse symptoms, get your butt to a hospital. Don't want you having a stroke

**Mother**: Oh my goodness you really need to read the articles to be informed

**OP**: Agree to disagree

**Mother**: It's such a shame that you have put so much trust into our medical Association and doctors

**OP**: Yes, I do trust science over folk remedies typically

**Mother**: H202 is been around for hundreds of years and was used to kill papers and I'll kinds of diseases back in the 1800s and 1700s but they stopped using it because I couldn't make money off of it

**OP**: I dont want to argue with you, you do what's best for you, and I'll make decisions for myself

**Mother**: This is not a folk remedy there is so much literature out there to support this if you would just take the time to read it

And I am not arguing I'm just trying to get you to look at another point of view  
This will protect you from the virus

**OP**: Why does it matter to you what I think about this? I've read all the stuff you have sent before. I still wouldn't drink hydrogen peroxide. I'm not telling you what to do.

**Mother**: And I am not saying to drink it and it matters because I love you and want to protect you

It is an inhalation method not ingesting it

**OP**: I am not worried about coronavirus. I imagine that at my demographic, it would just be a bad cold for me

**Mother**: Bill Monroe cured himself of prostate and melanoma cancer and lived for 25 more years until he was 90 And he was diagnosed at the age of 65

**OP**: Please drop this

**Mother**: Already did

**OP**: Thanks

One of these crossed the animal-human barrier this year and has just started to spread globally. Incidentally, with greater transmission risk and (subject to more data as we get more of a grasp on just how many people are infected but not showing significant symptoms) physical threat. WILL it become another perennial seasonal epidemic? Maybe maybe not. That's half the reason why the WHO and CDC are reacting so strongly to this - to prevent that eventuality.

H5N1, through January 2020, [had a cumulative 861 cases reported to the WHO](https://www.who.int/influenza/human_animal_interface/2020_01_20_tableH5N1.pdf?ua=1).

MRSA... Not sure how this is a comparison to a respiratory virus but it is a serious concern, just not of the type or scale of again, a respiratory virus.

SARS, 8096 global cases reported to the WHO.

I could keep going on looking up figures for you but somehow I doubt you're arguing in good faith and well... Look up your own figures.

Meanwhile, we've already surpassed 100,000 coronavirus cases globally and we're only what, a month and change into this. Comparing the Coronovirus to H5N1, SARS, swine flu is just ridiculous."

Dear faculty, staff, and students,

We write in follow up to our March 2 message to all instructors regarding planning ahead for instructional resilience. In light of the news yesterday that there is now a case of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) in the city of Berkeley, we are providing the following guidance to instructors on holding courses and exams. We are providing this guidance as a precautionary measure, so that students who feel unwell do not feel compelled to attend lectures or take examinations while they are ill.

INSTRUCTIONAL GUIDANCE

Instructors are asked to review and implement the following instructional guidance:

Holding Classes: In-person classes should continue to be held until advised otherwise. Additionally, instructors are asked, whenever feasible, to offer an online option for their course lecture material (see #2 and #3 below). Instructors who are unwell are asked, as is standard practice, to make arrangements to have their course covered.  

Course Capture (Screen Capture with Audio Recording - No Video of Instructor): For classes offered in rooms that are equipped and are not currently using course capture, we are asking for instructors to use the free Screen with Audio Recording option so that students can participate remotely. Email coursecapture@berkeley.edu with your course name to activate this option.

Alternate Means of Recording Classes: For classes offered in rooms where free Course Capture is not available, instructors are encouraged to:

use ZoomPro and a laptop to record lecture slides/audio where strong internet connection is available and share after class through bCourses; or record audio from your phone/tablet/laptop and share audio file and slide deck through bCourses as separate files; and share a text version through bCourses. 

Attendance Requirements: We are asking instructors to consider suspending any attendance requirements until further notice. 

Office Hours: We are asking instructors to consider enabling video conferencing for office hours. 

Exams: For examinations during the month of March, we encourage instructors to give take-home exams that are returned to the instructor using the bCourses Quizzes or Assignments functionality. Instructors should accommodate students who are ill. 

Labs: Labs should remain open and routine safety measures should continue to be adhered to.

Course Activities and Physical Contact:  We recommend instructors consider a no physical contact policy for course activities (e.g., for courses in the departments such as Theatre, Dance and Performing Studies, Physical Education, Maker Spaces, etc.). Additionally, staff, instructors, and students are strongly encouraged to properly clean contact surfaces and equipment before and after use. Facilities Services has also been asked to increase their cleaning services during this period.

RESOURCES

Schedule a virtual or in-person consultation with a DLS consultant for support in using digital methods for teaching. Please feel free to bring a GSI or other member of your teaching staff with you. Drop in consultation services will also be offered in the Academic Innovation Studio (117 Dwinelle) from 9am to 4pm Monday through Friday.

Terry Johnson, Faculty Director of the CTL, will hold a workshop on pedagogical approaches to disruption on Thursday March 5 from 4:45pm-6:00pm. To accommodate schedules and capacity an additional, identical workshop will be held the following week. You can attend in person at the Academic Innovation Studio or via Zoom.

Visit the Instructional Resilience Resources page for links to resources, best practices, support, and training materials. Here you will also learn how to access a free ZoomPro account, which allows instructors to offer audio and video streaming  for up to 300 participants and sessions lasting up to 24 hours. Instructors offering courses with extremely different needs - from small group seminars to large lectures - have successfully used  ZoomPro. Staff are currently on standby anticipating requests from instructors for these accounts. 

Please note that a detailed list of accommodations can be found on the Academic Accommodations Hub. An updated set of guidelines for missed days of instruction has also been issued by the Academic Senate. 

Instructors who have questions or concerns about implementing our recommendations, please elevate them to your chair for guidance. For issues that are not resolvable at the local level, chairs are encouraged to contact their deans. Should you have other issues that we have not addressed or ideas that might benefit the instructional mission of the campus during these times, please feel free to let us know by sending an email to vcue@berkeley.edu. We will do our utmost to respond in a timely manner. 

Thanking you for your efforts in support, patience, and wisdom as we collectively navigate this challenging time.

His constant lying about how it's no big deal (because he's responded so well) and everyone should go back to work is astonishing because you can really sense the fear in his voice and his body language. Every time he desperately asks a dumb question to an expert hoping that they'll tell him the vaccine will be ready in October to boost his polling figures. 

Unfortunately I think it's going to get pretty fucked up for Americans. Richard Hatchett (head of the CEPI) was on Channel 4 earlier today to reiterate what he's been saying for over a month now which is that this is potentially going to be [the worst pandemic we've seen in decades](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcJDpV-igjs) and that we are going to need near war time levels of mobilisation to manage this properly. And Trump is just not willing to do that because it will crater his approval ratings - it doesn't help that his pick to head the CDC is completely unqualified to be leading the response to something of this magnitude.

Anyway I'd like to know what people think of Hatchett's interview that I linked above. Not sure if it works outside the UK?"

They are good reference points, or zeroth-order approximations, to base policy on. However, sometimes within theory and often in practice, real humans don't behave in a way that supporters of anarchism would want them to behave. To me, government action is justified in a small number of cases, and in each case, my general reasoning goes as follows: if you were to adopt the anarchist ideal, the result would be outcome X in which individual rights would be put at risk. If we can decrease the chance of X by giving away a tiny amount of freedom Y elsewhere, then that is a good idea. Government is not good by itself, but sometimes, among realistic possibilities, it is the least bad. Let me make this more concrete with some examples.

Let's take the coronavirus, since it is justifiably on everyone's minds. The solution to this pandemic in an ideal ""approximately anarchist"" society is that you can sue anyone who transmits the disease to you. Anyone with coronavirus who sneezes in public would then be held liable for involuntary manslaughter at least and negligent manslaughter at worst; that would be the incentive for people to stay at home. But it's pretty easy to see that realistically this is not a good solution at all, because in order for the solution to be workable, it would have to be possible to survive entirely on your own, and if you got the disease, you'd have to know precisely who transmitted the coronavirus to you. What if you can't trace it back to its source? And if you can trace it back to one poor peasant in China, are you going to sue him for the trillions of dollars of damage to the global economy? What about the people who are already dead?

Broken promises are another failure mode of anarchism. This is an extremely broad category but includes, for example, the whole banking industry. If one million people deposit their savings (in gold, for example) in a bank, and those bankers steal the money and spend it on drugs and/or luxurious vacations; what then would you do? Can everyone be realistically expected to hire their own auditors to keep an eye on the bank at all times? What if the auditor is is bribed by the bankers?

Keep in mind that in all these cases, there's a genuine loss of individual freedom at the end. The victim has unambiguously been aggressed against. The banker (or the person who spreads viruses) is breaking the non-aggression principle, **and breaking it in a way that cannot be undone**. You can't get your money back, and dead people can't be brought back to life. Therefore, in these cases, the less bad option is to invest in a government agency that is empowered to use coercion, if needed, to contain the spread of disease, which is a worse form of coercion; or to have minimal oversight over banks to make sure that at the very least they're not lying to their customers.

Also note that this justification does not extend to personal inabilities that don't affect other people's lives. When you get sick from a non-infectious disease, that's not anyone else's problem. So the justification I mentioned above only covers something like a Center for Disease Control; it does **not** cover Medicare or Medicaid. The justification covers agencies that combat fraud, but it does not cover caps on loan rates or forced student loans."
