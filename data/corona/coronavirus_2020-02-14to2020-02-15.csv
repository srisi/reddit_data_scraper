1. A journalist from Tencent who follows Milan posted a seven-second video on Weibo, in which Buffon says:"" Fuck, you are from Wuhan?"" while signing autograph for the journalist. Then Buffon smiled and touched his face. The journalist said that he felt insulted and don't think this is a joke matter.
2. The reaction from Chinese are two-sided. One side thinks it is overblown, Buffon is clearly joking. If he really discriminated Chinese because of coronavirus, he wouldn't touch the journalist's face. The other side thought Buffon IS discriminating against Chinese and brought up his questionable past history with Fascist. I feel the first opinion is more mainstream. Most vocal people with the second opinion are Milan and Inter fans, who already hate Buffon.
3. After the topic is trending, the journalist posted the full video, in which Buffon said first:""Coronavirus... be careful.... I am watching....."", then with the Wuhan joke. The journalist then went on and explained that he didn't try to accuse Buffon as a racist. He just felt that this is an inappropriate joke and apologized for the confusion.
4. Then, the journalist got blasted for creating drama and providing misleading conversation in the first place. Many fans thought he did this on purpose because he is a Milan fan."

U.S. State Dept. will evacuate American citizens and their families aboard the Diamond Princess cruise ship - CDC official
About 380 people will be offered seats on two evacuation flights from Japan back to the U.S. - CDC official
Some may quarantine at Travis Air Force Base in California, while others may be transferred to Lackland Air Force Base in Texas
(Article below will update)
TOKYO—The pools, hot tubs and bars of the Diamond Princess emptied out on Feb. 5, when authorities quarantined the luxury cruise ship at a Yokohama dock. Instead of overflowing buffets, staff in surgical masks deliver boxed meals and snacks, about 11,000 a day.
Life has taken a turn for the nearly 3,500 passengers and crew aboard the $500 million vessel who entered a second week under quarantine for the coronavirus disease.
“I can’t wrap my head around the fact that I could die from this cruise,” said Gay Courter, a 75-year-old American novelist confined to a cabin with her husband. “I go look outside and there’s people in white hazmat suits.”
The only trips ashore are for those infected with the coronavirus, 218 so far, or people with other serious ailments. Of the disembarked passengers sick with the virus, eight are in serious condition, authorities said. Outside of China, the biggest outbreak is on the Diamond Princess.
The nearly 2,400 passengers who remain are largely trapped in their cabins. Health workers in masks and body suits knock on doors to ask selected passengers, including the elderly, to open wide for a throat swab. Used bedsheets and towels go into bags for incineration.
Anxiety and boredom appear the most common symptoms aboard what amounts to a floating petri dish. Aun Na Tan, of Melbourne, Australia, her husband, a 19-year-old son, and a daughter, 16, are stuck in a windowless cabin with two bunk beds. While the teens practice handstands, Ms. Tan said, “my husband is trying to learn.”
Shipboard entertainers have been assigned to record trivia quiz shows and origami-making for passengers to join along on cabin TVs. The magician recorded a performance, and a room steward demonstrated how to make a bed.


Coralie Williamson, 57, and her husband, Paul Williamson, 62, from Queensland, Australia, take turns reading from a book they brought, “The Resilience Project: Finding Happiness Through Gratitude, Empathy and Mindfulness.”
The couple had booked passage with a last-minute deal: A 250-square-foot cabin with a balcony was marked down to about $1,240 for the 15-day cruise that started in Yokohama, traveled south toward Vietnam and returned.
Their shared book, by Hugh van Cuylenburg, a former volunteer teacher in India, recounts the optimistic attitude among his underprivileged students. “It is helping us stay positive and express gratitude,” Mrs. Williamson said.


Ellis Vincent, a 76-year-old retired airline executive from Sydney, Australia, said he has spent more time than customary conversing with his wife while cooped up inside. She has an excellent memory, he said: “She is able to bring up every transgression I’ve ever had. I believe she is not finished.”
The operator of Diamond Princess, Princess Cruises, told passengers they would be refunded for the trip. Jan Swartz, the president of Princess Cruises, said last week the company was working closely with health authorities.
The shipboard contagion offers an opportunity to study the virus, said Michael Ryan, executive director of the World Health Organization’s Health Emergencies Program. He also acknowledged Thursday that “it’s a difficult thing for anybody to live in a closed environment like that.”
Japanese authorities on Friday arranged for 11 passengers to leave the ship and stay in government housing until the scheduled end of the ship’s two-week quarantine on Feb. 19. The passengers allowed to disembark were 80 and older and had met other conditions, including testing negative for the virus.
The total of laboratory-confirmed cases of the coronavirus, named Covid-19, reached 64,437 in China and 24 other countries. There have been 1,384 deaths, all but three in China. The U.S. confirmed its 15th case on Thursday.

#1 contacted my primary care doctor yesterday, because I've got all the symptoms, sick for 10+ days after returning from a month in Hawaii. No appointments avail, go to clinic on campus. OK.

#2 symptoms: cough, aches, pains, sore throat, intermittent fever, weird chunky gluey phlegm, headache, photosensitivity, running nose, ear ache, swollen lymph nodes, sinus pressure, not sleeping well, bit dazed all day, diarrhea for more than a week without improvement. Threw up one night but possible that was food allergy, unsure. 

#3 arrive Stanford ""Express Care"" 11AM

#4 first see doctor 5:05PM, yes 6 hours later

#5 doctor leaves exam room at 5:13PM (ie less than ten minutes later)

#6 doctor instructions: ""if you are dying from respiratory failure, go to the emergency room immediately."" Yeah no shit Sherlock. 

#7 doctor quote: ""90% of our patients here today have the same symptoms as you and are concerned about coronavirus, and want to be tested too."" This is noteworthy if they are running SIX HOURS BEHIND SCHEDULE AT A NOTIONAL WALK-IN CLINIC AND EVERYBODY HAS THE SAME SYMPTOMS NO?

#8 doctor quote: ""we're not testing anybody here for coronavirus"" Anybody. Under any circumstance. If we think you have it, then we'll tell the county government. They've already declared a medical emergency, so they're in charge of testing. We're just screening not testing. Huh? The government is now ""managing"" this? FFS. Why am I paying THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS A YEAR TO STANFORD FOR HEALTH CARE TO GET NONE WHEN I NEED IT?

#9 me: are we done now? I just spent seven hours (including drive time) for nothing. The ONLY reason I'm here is to be tested for coronavirus, in case i brought it back from the hospital in Hawaii I just spent a month visiting -- surrounded by people coughing themselves to death in the cardio-pulm ICU. i told you six hours ago this is the only reason I'm here. You couldn't have told me, you're not testing anybody?? Or take a sample? Anything? WTF Over? Are we done here?

#10 doctor: yeah we're done. But you should wait here for the nurse and paperwork, it's protocol.

#11. Another 10 minutes pass. (No nurse, no paperwork, nothing.) I've now waited for paperwork ABOUT the 10 minute visit in which nothing substantive happened, for longer than the nothing itself happened. This is like if Becket's Godot ran oft with Orwell's 1984 and made a Kafkaesque Lovechild named Gilliam's Brazil. And this is Silicon Valley, on the wealthiest campus in the world, where like 50% of the student body is Chinese?? Awesome. 

I've now spent basically the ENTIRE day accomplishing nothing, learning nothing I didn't already know. (Of course, if it's a regular flu I've got, it's slow and mild compared to what normally happens to me... and if it's a regular cold, then it's unusually severe and nasty, as colds don't normally set up shop in my lungs and guts and make me puke and shit myself for 10-14 days. You? We already knew all that. The question is: do I have something ELSE. Are my kids at risk? What do I DO next? Oh, the doctor says ""go to the ER if you're dying of respirtory distress"" gee thanks. You don't say?)

All of THIS at the best hospital in the richest county in the biggest state of the most powerful country in the world. It's a joke. But the funny Uh-Oh kind not the funny Ha-Ha kind. 

If this bug is HALF as bad as the CDC and Brits are warning, it's going global and dozens of millions of people are going to die. Because from what I saw today our ""system"" is woefully unprepared. In the best of times, in the best of places. Feels like we will look back on this sooner or later, and wish we'd done better. Because what I saw our species and nation doing today to fight this bug at Stanford was: fuck all."

The project is not entirely stalled, and the riots were nothing more than an inconvenience. It's the virus that is the problem. The team members and employees are currently scattered about China in various states - some are going through 2 week quarantine, some are self quarantined to avoid infection. There are even employees that Pat cannot contact in the midst of the epidemic (remember, this outbreak occurred during the week that everyone goes to visit family in China). 

Pat has informed the community that the CTO will still host beta tournaments but development during this outbreak will be slowed. It's sad yes, but to quote Pat, ""I'm keeping my employees safe so for the time being things will be moving extremely slow. This are extraordinary circumstances that we cannot control.""

From blood storms to honeycomb lungs, here’s an organ-by-organ look at how COVID-19 harms humans.

11 Minute Read

By Amy McKeever

PUBLISHED February 14, 2020

Much remains unknown about the novel coronavirus ripping through China, but one thing is certain. The disease can cast a storm over the whole human body.

Such has been the nature of past zoonotic coronaviruses, ones that hopped from animals to humans like SARS and MERS. Unlike their common-cold-causing cousins, these emergent coronaviruses can spark a viral-induced fire throughout many of a person’s organs, and the new disease—dubbed ""COVID-19"" by the World Health Organization on Tuesday—is no exception when it is severe.

That helps explain why the COVID-19 epidemic has killed more than 1,300 people, surpassing the SARS death toll in a matter of weeks. While the death rate for COVID-19 appears to be a tenth of SARS, the novel coronavirus has spread faster.

Confirmed cases rose to more than 60,000 on Thursday, nearly a 50 percent jump relative to the prior day. This leap reflects a change in the way Chinese authorities are diagnosing infections instead of a massive shift in the scope of the outbreak. Rather than wait for patients to test positive for the virus, diagnoses now include anyone whose chest scan reveals COVID-19’s distinctive pattern of pneumonia. This method will hopefully allow authorities to isolate and treat patients more quickly.

If this outbreak continues to spread, there’s no telling how harmful it could become. A leading epidemiologist at the University of Hong Kong warned this week that COVID-19 could infect 60 percent of the globe if left unchecked. On Thursday, China’s National Health Commission said more than 1,700 health care workers are ill with the new virus, and the announcement came just a day after the WHO wrapped a summit on the best protocols for hospital care and the development of therapeutics, like vaccines.

But what actually happens to your body when it is infected by the coronavirus? The new strain is so genetically similar to SARS that it has inherited the title SARS-CoV-2. So combining early research on the new outbreak with past lessons from SARS and MERS can provide an answer.

The Lungs: Ground zero

For most patients, COVID-19 begins and ends in their lungs, because like the flu, coronaviruses are respiratory diseases.

They spread typically when an infected person coughs or sneezes, spraying droplets that can transmit the virus to anyone in close contact. Coronaviruses also cause flu-like symptoms: Patients might start out with a fever and cough that progresses to pneumonia or worse. (Find out how coronavirus spreads on a plane—and the safest place to sit).

After the SARS outbreak, the World Health Organization reported that the disease typically attacked the lungs in three phases: viral replication, immune hyper-reactivity, and pulmonary destruction.

Not all patients went through all three phases—in fact only 25 percent of SARS patients suffered respiratory failure, the defining signature of severe cases. Likewise, COVID-19, according to early data, causes milder symptoms in about 82 percent of cases, while the remainder are severe or critical.

Look deeper, and the novel coronavirus appears to follow other patterns of SARS, says University of Maryland School of Medicine associate professor Matthew B. Frieman, who studies highly pathogenic coronaviruses.

In the early days of an infection, the novel coronavirus rapidly invades human lung cells. Those lung cells come in two classes: ones that make mucus and ones with hair-like batons called cilia.

Mucus, though gross when outside the body, helps protect lung tissue from pathogens and make sure your breathing organ doesn’t dry out. The cilia cells beat around the mucus, clearing out debris like pollen or viruses.

Frieman explains that SARS loved to infect and kill cilia cells, which then sloughed off and filled patients’ airways with debris and fluids, and he hypothesizes that the same is happening with the novel coronavirus. That’s because the earliest studies on COVID-19 have shown that many patients develop pneumonia in both lungs, accompanied by symptoms like shortness of breath.

That’s when phase two and the immune system kicks in. Aroused by the presence of a viral invader, our bodies step up to fight the disease by flooding the lungs with immune cells to clear away the damage and repair the lung tissue.

When working properly, this inflammatory process is tightly regulated and confined only to infected areas. But sometimes your immune system goes haywire and those cells kill anything in their way, including your healthy tissue.

“So you get more damage instead of less from the immune response,” Frieman says. Even more debris clogs up the lungs, and pneumonia worsens. (Find out how the novel coronavirus compares to flu, Ebola, and other major outbreaks).

Lungs 101 The lungs replenish the body with life-giving oxygen. Learn about the anatomy of the lungs, how the organs make respiration possible, and how they are vulnerable to illnesses.

During the third phase, lung damage continues to build—which can result in respiratory failure. Even if death doesn’t occur, some patients survive with permanent lung damage. According to the WHO, SARS punched holes in the lungs, giving them “a honeycomb-like appearance”—and these lesions are present in those afflicted by novel coronavirus, too.

These holes are likely created by the immune system’s hyperactive response, which creates scars that both protect and stiffen the lungs.

When that occurs, patients often have to be put on ventilators to assist their breathing. Meanwhile, inflammation also makes the membranes between the air sacs and blood vessels more permeable, which can fill the lungs with fluid and affect their ability to oxygenate blood.

“In severe cases, you basically flood your lungs and you can’t breathe,” Frieman says. “That’s how people are dying.”

The Stomach: A shared gateway

During the SARS and MERS outbreaks, nearly a quarter of patients had diarrhea—a much more significant feature of those zoonotic coronaviruses. But Frieman says it’s still not clear whether gastrointestinal symptoms play a major part in the latest outbreak, given cases diarrhea and abdominal pain have been rare. But why does a respiratory virus bother the gut at all?

When any virus enters your body, it looks for human cells with its favorite doorways—proteins on the outside of the cells called receptors. If the virus finds a compatible receptor on a cell, it can invade."

This kind of thing leads to sick people and really needs to cease.

Late that day, Hong Kong’s health authority announced that the 80-year-old Hong Kong man who left the cruise early had the coronavirus disease.
Japanese officials said a formal notification didn’t arrive until the next day, Feb. 2. If it had come earlier, the Diamond Princess might have been refused entry to Japan, said Kenichi Hoshino, a health ministry official. Another cruise ship, the Westerdam, headed for Japan later that week was denied access and stayed at sea until receiving permission to dock Thursday in Cambodia.
From Okinawa, the Diamond Princess, with 2,666 passengers and 1,045 crew, headed for Yokohama and another immigration inspection. Ship passengers said they didn’t get any special precautions on the last leg of the trip.
OPEN BAR
Diamond Princess revelers crowded the captain’s farewell cocktail hour after sunset on Feb. 2. They drank free beer and wine in the ship’s atrium, which rose three decks. Guests filled seats in the Princess Theater for a production of the musical “Bravo.” Lines of diners stretched past buffet tables.


Kazunori Oishi, who formerly headed infectious-disease surveillance at Japan’s National Institute of Infectious Diseases, said it was a ripe environment for the virus to spread. Delays in recognizing the danger “created a lot of occasions for close contact,” said Dr. Oishi, especially the eating, drinking and conviviality that is common in the close confines of a cruise ship.
On the evening of Feb. 3, the Diamond Princess arrived in Tokyo Bay. Japanese health officials met the ship. They took the temperature of passengers and later collected throat swabs from those suspected of having the virus.
The next day, Feb. 4, passengers mingled without restrictions or warnings, said Mr. Vincent, the retired airline executive. “We could eat where we want, we could go where we want.”
Early the next morning, everything changed. Around 6:30 a.m. a captain’s announcement startled passengers. He ordered them to stay in their cabins. Shortly after, he said that 10 people had tested positive for the virus. Then he announced that everyone on board was under quarantine for two weeks. The only exception was one nobody wanted: a positive test for the virus."

“The number of confirmed cases of the Wuhan coronavirus have continued to surge inside China, sickening tens of thousands, with a death toll of more than 1,000. But outside the Asian giant the numbers remain a fraction of that, a trend Harvard’s Marc Lipsitch views with suspicion. Lipsitch thinks it is just a matter of time before the virus spreads widely internationally, which means nations so far only lightly hit should prepare for its eventual arrival in force and what may seem like the worst flu season in modern times. Lipsitch, professor of epidemiology at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health and head of the School’s Center for Communicable Disease Dynamics, talked to the Gazette about recent developments in the outbreak and provided a look ahead.”

In my view, this is political grandstanding. CN Rail had a week-long strike last year and while the impact on the economy was negative, the magnitude of the disruption was limited. At present time, the blockade isn't as bad as Scheer makes it out to be and its overall impact on the economy is negligible. That all said, it's still early days in that we don't yet know how long the rail disruption will last but I think it's unlikely for this situation to persist.

I'd argue that the coronavirus has more of a negative impact on the Canadian economy than the blockade at present time via downward pressure on global oil prices and negative sentiment on global trade."

Nope, it's not on par. Most if not all of infections in South Korea came from people visiting Wuhan China. The number of new infections has dramatically slowed with travel restrictions imposed on visitors from Hubei province of China, with South Korea showing no infections within the population (that are not related to visitors coming from China).

On the other hand, Japan is right now the riskiest country outside of China because infections including deaths within Japan is starting to spread amongst those who never visited China.

>Infections of a new coronavirus originating in Wuhan further spread in Japan among people with no direct connections to China as new cases were reported in Tokyo, Aichi, Hokkaido and Okinawa on Friday.

>250 people in Japan -- 218 of whom are passengers and crew from a cruise ship quarantined in Yokohama -- have been found to be infected with the pneumonia-causing virus.

Japan is showing that it is utterly incapable of handling a mass outbreak, with the way they handled the cruise ship fiasco. Visitors to there are taking a huge chance of infection since the outbreak has now caught onto their general population and the Japanese government has no clue as to how to track down the origins of the infection. In few weeks, Japan could have a out of control epidemic."

No known cases on board, but they were turned away from several ports. So 14 days at sea and no one is sick.

https://www.businessinsider.com/wuhan-coronavirus-face-masks-not-entirely-effective-2020-1

Basically, flu spreads through ""mist"", air droplets.  

> Surgical masks, meanwhile, are designed to keep droplets and splatter from passing from a person's mouth to nearby surfaces or people. **So they're primarily meant to keep healthcare providers from spreading their own mouth-borne germs to patients.** 

Another tidbit that's helpful:

> N95 respirators filter out most airborne particles from the surrounding air, preventing wearers from breathing in particles down to **0.3 microns** in diameter. These types of masks are often used when air quality is poor due to wildfire smoke or pollution, and they're designed to fit tightly against one's face.


> **However, the coronavirus measures between .05 and 0.2 microns in diameter, according to a recent article in The Lancet.**"

**2.14.2020 (Valentine’s Day) Update:**

**2019-nCOV: (*****Considerably*****) Worse than the 1918 Spanish Flu.**

Known Facts:

1\*\*. Basic Reproductive Number:\*\* (Average) **R0 of 2.6-6.6.** This is *considerably more* contagious than the 1918 Spanish flu, on Par with Smallpox. Reputable Source (although not yet peer-reviewed) *Los Alamos National Laboratory.* Containment and Quarantine is virtually useless with R0 values at this level.

2. Up to 14 day contagious asymptomatic period *plus* another 1-2 weeks of infection *and* post infection spreading. Roughly 28 days of infectious period is *considerably worse* than the 1918 Spanish Flu.

3. Critical Illness / Fatality Rate: Whistleblowers indicate a hospitalization rate of 20-25%. Without hospitalization, much of that 20-25% = death. Minimum fatality rate of 2%, with some estimates of 5% *with* hospitalization. This is *on par* with the 1918 Spanish Flu.

4. **Symptoms and Course of Illness:** Contagious, but not necessarily with fever (makes detection very challenging). Tests are roughly 50% accurate, expensive, and limited. Cytokine Storm, bloody pneumonia, multiple organ failure. Compared to 2003 SARS, the progression of respiratory failure is much faster; lack of oxygen is more evident. 2019 Coronavirus is a severe form of ARDS - Acute respiratory distress syndrome. Double pneumonia and *severe* heart damage to infected patients. Lasting injury, even after recovering. Without hospitalization = high chance of death. Reports also indicate that it’s not possible to “self-heal” – meaning that without hospitalization death is highly likely. Overall – reports indicate that when this infection becomes severe (20-25% of the time), *considerably* more challenging to treat than SARS/MERS.

5. In severe cases, one cannot self-heal. Just “hope” you have oxygen and IV fluids. Without intensive care, mortality rate may as high as 25%.

6. Surface Contagion and viral survival: Coronavirus, such as COVID, have the following features that make quarantine relatively ineffective: a) SARS was infective on a non-porous surface for 6 days, taking up to nine days to lose its infectivity completely b) 20% of the original aerosolized virus was detected at 20C at 50% relative humidity was still detectable after 6 days. C) After 4 weeks at 4C in water and sewage the virus had not lost infectivity D) Many common disinfectants are ineffective (bleach, ammoniums, etc) with the exception of ethanols or isopropyls. This means that without alcohol – your surfaces will not get disinfected. This also means that COVID will remain on surfaces for at least 6 days, up to 9 (other reports indicate weeks).

7. Virus spread from droplets, vomit, feces, and bodily fluids – working with patients results in *very high* rates of transmission to doctors and medical workers/family members/etc.

8. Multiple opportunities for infection, even after “healing”. This makes containment relatively ineffective, and cements this virus as a member of our global community – as future infections, as is the case with the cold, or with the flu – will certainly happen.

8. China's quarantine of 100+ million people, and the shutdown of its economy is unprecedented and has never happened before. With n R0 of 6.6, we now understand *why* China went to these lengths. China is still mostly shut down.

9. Thousands of flights continue to come and go - flights haven't stopped. Hundreds of cruise ships continue unabated on a global scale. Chinese flights *have* slowed down considerably. It’s still perfectly possible to fly to China, get the virus, and travel back to any major metropolitan region on Earth.

**Where did COVID come from?**

Two hypotheses have been proposed: Two studies do seem to point towards animal origins, one from Nature.

On other hand, increasingly large numbers of highly educated individuals are proposing that this virus likely originated from a Bio Lab.

**What to Expect?** We still do not have any confirmation of facts indicating exactly how susceptible different ethnicities are to nCOV. Preliminary reports indicate smokers and individuals who breathe in highly polluted air may be more susceptible. China and Asia in general contain billions of people, and tend to be intensely overcrowded – a perfect location for COVID-19.

With an average R0 as high as 6.6 (roughly speaking), a 30 day period of individuals capable of spreading the infection, a 25% critical illness rate, and an inability to heal without medical intervention (once the illness become severe) we can expect a *considerably* worse situation than the 1918 Spanish Flu. ***Unfortunately, these facts clearly point towards a virus capable of collapsing industrialized civilization.***

This whole coronavirus panic is utter and total bullshit. The coronavirus is already spread all over the globe as it is a family of viruses and not a single pathogen. It causes symptoms of respiratory infection which is usually as mild as a simple cold so that you don't even know you have it. The novel coronavirus originating from Wuhan is a mutation. It has a mortality rate of 2-3%. How it came to be is another question. Why does the media make such a huge panic about it just like the Ebola virus. It was always present in Africa but last time they made a doomsday scenario out of it. Perhaps to cover something up to distract the public. I believe it is the same with the coronavirus now. In the end ask yourself what the emperor did when the common rabble was dissatisfied.

CFR results from dividing number of deaths by number of total infected/cases. With regard to China specifically, we know that in Hubei, clinically diagnosed cases are also being included now, and they said this was the case in the other provinces as well. I didn't include a detailed breakdown of other countries, just of China, where things are most critical.

I think these **CFR numbers may be notably lower than some would expect** based on the overall impression created by media coverage and anxiety.

Note that 96% of all deaths world wide are from the Hubei province, which as the epicenter was hit first and totally unprepared, and where the medical system was basically seriously overwhelmed from the very beginning. Almost everywhere else within China, numbers look far more positive, and they are even better outside of China.

>As of 24:00 on Feb 14, the National Health Commission had received 66,492 reports of confirmed cases and 1,523 deaths in 31 provincial-level regions on the Chinese mainland and the Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps, and in all 8,096 patients had been cured and discharged from hospital. There still remained 56,873 confirmed cases (including 11,053 in serious condition) and 8,969 suspected cases. So far, 513,183 people have been identified as having had close contact with infected patients. 169,039 are now under medical observation.

  


  
[CDC defines ""close contact"" as](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/faq.html)

>a) being within approximately 6 feet (2 meters) of a 2019-nCoV case for a prolonged period of time; close contact can occur while caring for, living with, visiting, or sharing a health care waiting area or room with a 2019-nCoV case  
>  
>*– or –*  
>  
>b) having direct contact with infectious secretions of a 2019-nCoV case (e.g., being coughed on)  
>  
>If such contact occurs while not wearing recommended personal protective equipment or PPE (e.g., gowns, gloves, NIOSH-certified disposable N95 respirator, eye protection), criteria for PUI consideration are met”

  


Can someone confirm or correct my logic here?  


Total confirmed: 66,492

Close contacts: 513,183

Average contacts per person: TC/CC = 7.71, assuming no duplicate contacts  


Does that mean that if you are what is defined by the CDC as a ""close contact"" that

With an R0 of 1: 12.97016861% chance of catching the virus from a contagious person

With an R0 of 2: 25.94033722% chance of catching the virus from a contagious person

With an R0 of 3: 38.91050584% chance of catching the virus from a contagious person

With an R0 of 4: 51.88067445% chance of catching the virus from a contagious person

With an R0 of 5: 64.85084306% chance of catching the virus from a contagious person

With an R0 of 6: 77.82101167% chance of catching the virus from a contagious person

  


The flu has an R0 of \~1.3, according to various Google results which comes to a 16.86% chance that a close contact catches the flu using the above assumption.  According to WebMD, 5 - 20% of Americans catch the flu so 16% seams in line with that.

SYDNEY (AFP) - Top Australian universities warned on Friday (Feb 14) that Chinese students may walk away from courses Down Under after Canberra extended a coronavirus travel ban, in a major blow to the multi-billion-dollar sector.

Nearly 70,000 Chinese visa holders are due to start their semesters soon at eight top-ranked universities, but have been stuck since the bans started on Feb 1, said Ms Vicki Thomson, chief executive of Group of Eight, which represents the universities.

""We can't give our students any certainty as to when they can actually come here. So there is a risk of students choosing not to come here,"" Ms Thomson said.

""We are in quite unprecedented times and uncertain times.""

Prime Minister Scott Morrison announced on Thursday that the ban would be extended for at least another week, drawing the ire of China, which branded the move an ""overreaction"".

Ms Thompson warned that countries with competing universities, such as Britain and Canada, remain open to Chinese students and many people could look elsewhere.

Swelling Chinese enrolment numbers - up from fewer than 23,000 in 2003 during the Sars outbreak to more than 150,000 in 2018 - and the timing of the coronavirus at the start of the nation's academic year meant the impact was unprecedented, she said.

""Put all those factors together and, you know, it couldn't have happened at a worse time.""

International education was worth A$32.4 billion (S$30.3 billion) to the economy in 2017-18.

Top universities stand to lose around US$2 billion (S$2.8 billion) in fees alone, according to recent preliminary estimates by Standard & Poor's.

The virus has killed nearly 1,400 people and infected 64,000, mainly in China. As of Friday morning, 15 cases of the virus had been detected in Australia.

The economic impact of the virus, chasing a summer of devastating bush fires, is yet to be realised. Australia's central bank held interest rates at a record low last week.

""Obviously, the coronavirus will have an impact on the economy, (but) it is too early to quantify that impact,"" Finance Minister Mathias Cormann said on Friday."

That's a 2.1% mortality rate. 

2% is incredibly low for any disease. Hepatitis, Small Pox, Chicken Pox, Rhinovirus (the common cold), Mumps etc. These are all the ailments in company with Coronavirus. 

250,000 people just in 2020 have been hospitalized for Influenza, and  14,000 people have died which is a 5.6% mortality rate. That's more than DOUBLE the mortality rate of Coronavirus. But when Influenza comes around, old people and immuno-compromised get vaccines. The rest of us just don't care because getting influenza doesn't scare most people in our country. We wash our hands, and sanitize door knobs, bathrooms, etc.  Why should anyone be terrified and be called a misinformed ignorant fuckwad over a virus that's half the danger of Influenza? Is it because maybe you're the one who is ignorant? I mean maybe just maybe.... you haven't done the math to realize that comparative to other diseases, Coronavirus isn't a threat?

So there's your math. Do with it what you will.

EDIT: It's also worth pointing out that Influenza has a transmission rate of 10, and Coronavirus has a transmission rate of 3. They aren't even in the same league."

> Of course, deaths are not the only impactful metric by far - there would be far more seriously ill people than those who die. In addition to the many millions who would die, many more would become severely ill and need hospital care. How many? Right now the WHO estimates 20%. https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.nytimes.com/article/what-is-coronavirus.amp.html Some of them will be critically ill with Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome and multiple organ failure (common complications of this virus), requiring ICU level care with full ventilation. There are only a hundred thousand or so ICU beds in the entire United States, a highly developed first world country. Even if only a small percentage of the 7.2 million severely ill people in America need ICU treatment to survive (assuming the lower 11% infection figure), you’re easily exceeding the entire country’s ICU capacity many times over. And, of course, ICU beds don’t just sit around empty all the time when there is no pandemic around, and people don’t stop needing the ICU for other non-pandemic things just because a pandemic is happening. The same applies to regularly staffed hospital beds, of which America only has roughly a million of. To treat 7.2 million severely ill people. On the low end. Now imagine you live in West Africa or a poorer district of India - how do you think the hospital situation there would fare with such influx?
> 
> So you can see why a pandemic coronavirus is likely not on the same level as the common flu or heart disease or whatever random common thing people online are comparing it to. If it happens, it will be a highly memorable world event, killing perhaps a fourth to a half as many people who died in World War 2 - assuming no more than 20% of people in the world catch it, and assuming health care can keep up so that otherwise manageable cases aren’t triaged or just neglected into a fatality, which might be asking a lot. In a “really bad” scenario, 100 million plus deaths across the globe is probably not out of the question. At some point it gets bad enough that you have to start taking into account the effect of collapsed supply chains, production shortages, and breakdowns in civil order. Which is way beyond back of the envelope.

Remember, Wuhan is a city of 11 million people, bigger than London or New York, so there are many localities within the city.

Recently they were concerned as a doctor is appealing for masks to help look after patients (they've run out and it's difficult to get supplies into the city.) Apparently no one in the block of flats they're in is ill, but there is now a case living in the next building along.

They describe that they are constantly hearing about cases of people getting fever, passing out etc. who cannot get diagnosed or cannot get to the hospital because of the strain on the medical system there at the moment. ""Never really sure how many people are infected or dying of it.""

Obviously local social media is horrendous - lots of shared stories about whole families with the virus, stories about individual people who are dying in certain circumstances, issues at the hospital, stories about the healthcare workers and the immense strain that they are under at the moment. They report there being three stadiums filled with beds for the confirmed cases to stay in, but there are also cases of people who are dying without being confirmed.

I also saw at least one thing that looked a lot like propaganda, a list of outbreaks of diseases with higher fatality rates than coronavirus to make it look as if the disease was not as dangerous. Most of them are factual but they claim that the H1N1 pandemic (Swine flu) of 2009 had a 17% fatality rate - well, that's simply not true.

It's been very distressing reading these updates. I admit I never knew this person well, we had a total of maybe one conversation, but I can't imagine what they are going through right now. I'm just hoping I never have to read the post where they talk about themselves or a family member getting sick.  It's really hard to gauge from one person's subjective experience how bad things are, though. Imagine you were on lockdown, stuck indoors all day with nothing to do but follow the stories of people being infected and dying and worrying about when that might be you, running out of supplies. Even per official Chinese numbers we're talking tens of thousands of people with the virus in this city (enough to fill three stadiums with beds easily). That's a fraction of 11 million, but it would feel like the end of the world. And not knowing how much longer you could be stuck in lockdown would be even worse."

Currently, the emergence of a novel human coronavirus, temporary named 2019-nCoV, has become a global health concern causing severe respiratory tract infections in humans. Human-to-human transmissions have been described with incubation times between 2-10 days, facilitating its spread via droplets, contaminated hands or surfaces. We therefore reviewed the literature on all available information about the persistence of human and veterinary coronaviruses on inanimate surfaces as well as inactivation strategies with biocidal agents used for chemical disinfection, e.g. in healthcare facilities. The analysis of 22 studies reveals that human coronaviruses such as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) coronavirus, Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) coronavirus or endemic human coronaviruses (HCoV) can persist on inanimate surfaces like metal, glass or plastic for up to 9 days, but can be efficiently inactivated by surface disinfection procedures with 62-71% ethanol, 0.5% hydrogen peroxide or 0.1% sodium hypochlorite within 1 minute. Other biocidal agents such as 0.05-0.2% benzalkonium chloride or 0.02% chlorhexidine digluconate are less effective.

>Global companies have flocked to invest in China for decades, lured by the promise of cheap, skilled labor and a stable, if tyrannical, government. Recent economic shocks show it’s time for them to rethink that cozy arrangement.  
>  
>The coronavirus outbreak is the first shock to the Chinese industrial complex. The disease is spreading so fast that China has been forced to quarantine tens of millions of people in their homes and restrict travel between its provinces. This is an economic as well as a humanitarian crisis. Tens of thousands of factories [lay idle](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/economic-fallout-from-chinas-coronavirus-mounts-across-the-globe/2020/02/13/7bb69a12-4e8c-11ea-9b5c-eac5b16dafaa_story.html?tid=lk_inline_manual_3&itid=lk_inline_manual_3) and won’t reopen for months. Others operate at reduced capacity as workers don’t show up out of fear they will contract the virus, while goods from the plants that are open are stalled at border checks to ensure the virus doesn’t spread.  
>  
>This is dramatically slowing global growth. Many Western companies depend on Chinese-made parts for the goods they assemble elsewhere. Stop the flow of parts from China, and you stop the flow of goods from the rest of the world. [Experts](https://www.capitaleconomics.com/clients/publications/global-economics/global-economics-update/coronavirus-to-end-43-quarter-global-growth-streak/) are already projecting the global economy will not grow at all in the first quarter of this year as a result, the first downturn since last decade’s financial crisis.  
>  
>Companies have to wonder whether China is peculiarly at risk for these mysterious epidemics. The SARS virus exploded out of China in 2003, causing thousands of infections with a 10 percent mortality rate, [according](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3329048/) to the National Institutes of Health. This was another version of a coronavirus, according to lab tests. China was not the center of global manufacturing then, so its outbreak caused less disruption than is now the case. But no other global power has had two mysterious, rapidly spreading viruses arise in this time period. Is it worth the risk that it could happen again?  
>  
>Political pressure from the United States is another risk factor that companies now must weigh. Federal prosecutors unsealed an [indictment](https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2020/02/13/us-charges-chinas-huawei-with-conspiracy-steal-us-trade-secrets-new-indictment/?tid=lk_inline_manual_8&itid=lk_inline_manual_8) Thursday against the Chinese telecommunications giant Huawei, alleging the firm engages in racketeering and conspiracy to steal industrial secrets. The United States and other companies have long charged that Chinese firms, under the benign gaze of the Communist government, steal their technology. If the Huawei complaint is just the tip of the iceberg, it means the United States will have to start turning to its own court system to punish alleged miscreants. That in turn will cause any Western business that contracts with Chinese firms under indictment or suspicion to have second thoughts about their relationship. Safer, perhaps, to find company in a country that has less of a risk falling into crosshairs with the U.S. government.  
>  
>Finally, climate-change pressure will soon have to hit business dealings with China. China is the world’s largest emitter of greenhouse gases, and its emissions [are increasing](http://www.globalcarbonatlas.org/en/CO2-emissions) faster than the United States and Europe can decrease theirs. But Western developed nations are to blame for much of this increase, as they are the driving forces behind investment in Chinese factories that then export goods back to the West. That gives climate-change activists a powerful lever to use if they decide to get serious about reducing emissions: tariffs.  
>  
>  
>  
>Most serious climate-change plans already recognize this. They aren’t called tariffs per se; advocates [label](https://www.carbontax.org/issues/border-adjustments/) them as “border tax adjustments.” But they are tariffs, and they would increase the price of goods imported from countries with heavy greenhouse-gas emissions. That will devastate a country such as China, whose industrial rise is [fueled](https://www.forbes.com/sites/chuckdevore/2019/12/16/china-goes-all-in-on-coal-while-telling-the-rest-of-the-world-to-reduce-emissions/#e97cce7add6a) by coal-fueled electricity. Indeed, China still is building hundreds of coal-fueled plants despite global pressure to reduce emissions. That will have to stop if we have any chance of beating climate change, but that means plants in China will see their energy costs rise dramatically.  
>  
>Combined, these factors will increasingly make it cost-effective to bring manufacturing back to the developed world or countries in those nations’ sphere of influence. The United States and Canada, for example, don’t run the risk of plants shutting down because of pandemics and increasingly rely on clean fuels for their energy. Nearby Mexico can offer cheaper labor, and Mexico’s economic dependence on those two giants means it is more amenable to climate-change-induced pressure. European firms have the same incentives and have the low-cost countries of Eastern Europe to invest in, too.  
>  
>None of this will happen overnight, but any rational company has to see the writing on the wall. Slow but steady disengagement with China will cost money in the short term but will likely pay off big in the long term."

See, this is exactly what I mean, I'm glad you made this comment because I feel that it is emblematic of the view many people in the West take, particularly the colour-obsessed Anglo-Franco-American cultures. 

First of all, what is white? Syrians are whiter than Greeks, but you don't have to be an expert in social issues to realise which one faces more prejudice these days. Turks are literally identical to Greeks insofar even the most precise measurements of ethnic origins go, genetic markers, and yet Turks are far less welcome in Europe than Greeks. Poles and Ukrainians face discrimination in UK but French and Germans do not. 

White is a social construct, yet you're using it to define people. White changes based on what's convenient to the elites or whatever new geopolitical situation arises. Japanese can be 'white enough' for Nazis and for the West today, but Chinese can't catch a break, especially with the latest coronavirus thing people are literally treating some Chinese people like they're some infected plague carriers. Other sinophobic people claim Chinese are 'culturally incompatible' and cite stuff like cheating or whatnot, even though for centuries Japan has been importing Chinese culture wholesale.

***

Diversity isn't as simple as ""white"", when some Westerner calls Russia ""all white"" it really grinds my gears, Russia is without a doubt the most diverse country in Europe and imo much more diverse than US. Is it as tolerant or as progressive? No, Russia is actually in deep shit insofar as that is concerned. However, if we're just measuring diversity, Russia is great. We don't have the assimilation melting-pot culture of US and we had too much land and too few people to exterminate the indigenous people in our Wild West, or Wild East as it was for us. So as a result, Russia is full of all sorts of very different people. None of them are black, but that doesn't mean they aren't as different as you can imagine two different cultures to be. 

The fact that you are advocating social justice and inclusion of diversity and have no inkling of what diversity is when it's staring you in the face is really sad, it's the product of the ""crayon tokenism"" as I call it, where some people aren't actually looking for diversity, but simply different skin colours. There are nearly 200 ethnic groups in Russia and 22 of them are numerous and concentrated enough in their original area of settlement that they have their own separate Republics, which constitute the Russian federation, which is comprised of 85 federal subjects (different types of territories, so kinda like US/German states, but more diverse than US states, because Russian subjects all have their unique history reaching back thousands of years, without necessarily wiping out the original inhabitants). The 22 different Republics have their own language, school system, etc -- they are culturally distinct. 
***
Even to a Westerner unfamiliar with Russia, it shouldn't be difficult to tell Tatars from Russians from Chechens and from Yakut.  All these groups have their own languages and they fall into different ethnic groups, the major ones in Russia are European, Uralic, Turkic, Caucasian (*the mountain range, they're not what West calls Caucasian, but rather people like Chechens, Dagestani, Ossetians, etc*), Mongolic, Chukchi, Tungusic, etc. 

They look different too, I guess if I had to satisfy your crayon tokenism because apparently diversity is only how different your face looks and how well it fits into the Official American Chart of Races (tm), I would say that to an average clueless American, Russians range from ""Middle Eastern"" looking to ""Asian"" to ""European/white"" to ""Native American/Inuit"" but that's offensive as hell because they're pretty different. 

Still, after living in US for a bunch of years and going to Russian group meetups, I get all kinds of funny stories of those people being asked what are they and forcing Americans to invent new ""racial classifications"". Like, what are the [Udmurtian people](https://edmooneyphoto.files.wordpress.com/2014/11/05.jpg), in America they would be called ""Asian redheads"" but they're Uralic people so I guess they're from Asia technically, just not in any way similar to what Americans consider as Asian (aka East Asians)"

There are many molecular virology textbooks and articles that cite Coronaviruses as the viral type causing the common cold, a quick Google or Pubmed search can turn up results I'm sure. However it's not as simple as saying that this particular Coronavirus is a simple mutation from the cold. Coronavirus is essentially a viral genus consisting of all sorts of variants and the current outbreak belongs to this genus. It is definitely a mutation from some other Coronavirus that allowed it to become so virulent in humans but I'm not sure on the specifics so I'm not sure that it mutated directly from a human cold virus. SARS was also a Coronavirus thought to have undergone a mutation allowing it to jump species to infect humans.

Also nucleic acid based vaccines (viral RNA) tend to have lower efficacy when compared to other types of vaccines like live or inactivated with the advantage of being rapidly produced, which is better than nothing but not at all like the flu vaccines of today.

But as I understood it, most of the deaths in Canada occured around two outbreaks that were from individual cases that were hospitalised. Most of the people affected were either staff or patients in a hospital - so, if they had some underlying health conditions already, this may help to explain why the CFR was higher there.   


It is also worth saying that historically, several viruses have emerged from animals that were originally very deadly, and then a less deadly but more virulent strain took over. In short, you have a better chance of reproducing and spreading if you only cause a mild illness, rather than killing your host. This may not be the case with Coronavirus, but we don't know that mutations will necessarily make it worse.   


Another thing to consider is the average age of the population in different countries."

Overall assessment: Overseas deliveries as per last year.  The US trend has been slight decline...prediction:

Tesla will (for the first time in several years I believe) have a quarterly drop in deliveries.  Bears will point to demand, believers will point to coronavirus and re-tooling downtime for Model Y...and that will be enough to keep Tesla plodding along for at least another quarter, when IMHO they will make photo-op delivieries of the Model Y to keep the narrative going for a few more quarters."

Here’s the abstract:


The novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) is a recently emerged human pathogen that has spread widely since January 2020. Initially, the basic reproductive number, R0, was estimated to be 2.2 to 2.7. Here we provide a new estimate of this quantity. We collected extensive individual case reports and estimated key epidemiology parameters, including the incubation period. Integrating these estimates and high-resolution real-time human travel and infection data with mathematical models, we estimated that the number of infected individuals during early epidemic double every 2.4 days, and the R0 value is likely to be between 4.7 and 6.6. We further show that quarantine and contact tracing of symptomatic individuals alone may not be effective and early, strong control measures are needed to stop transmission of the virus."

In that sense it does not pose an immediate existential crisis for the world, and its effect will be less pronounced in developed regions. The issue is that we still don't clearly know the period of when someone can transmit it (especially when not showing clear symptoms), that it's not consistently being detected, and that many of us may have little to no immunity against it.

I like BART. I like sitting in the train and watching videos or listening to podcasts and having a relaxing ride to SF. It's a much better ride from the peninsula to SF than east bay to SF - I don't think the homeless and theft problems are as prevalent from the peninsula.

I have to drive to the BART station anyway, so awhile back I created a spreadsheet to determine what was my best option - driving to which BART station would be cheapest. I calculated gas based on my car's average MPG, figured out how far the stations are, and based on whatever gas price I decided at the time calculated my cost per trip. Then adding parking + BART fares round trip.

I ended up buying a cheap electric scooter and parking a few blocks away from the station. I saved on parking in 6 months or so of doing this, and after that the scooter paid for itself plus I got a new toy. It was awhile ago so I don't remember exactly how many months I calculated it out to be.

Just recently with this whole coronavirus thing I wanted to avoid public transit. Probably being paranoid but I figured I'd explore my options. Now I drive into SF but park down by Cesar Chavez, so a mile or two south of the ballpark. All day free street parking. And ride my bike the rest of the way in. Free bike parking in the parking lot under my office building. I like riding my bike so that part of the commute is great, though the tradeoff is fighting traffic all the way there.

So those are some options for you folks to consider."

>>The elusive nature of asymptomatic carriers has three important implications for understanding and controlling infectious diseases with carriers. First, incidence data typically only reflect symptomatic cases of infection, making the true extent of asymptomatic carriage for particular diseases difficult to assess. **For example, estimates of the population-level prevalence of influenza carriage range from 5 to 35%**.

From the Minister of Health—Singapore 

>> ""The transmission mechanism of COVID-19 is different from SARS. In fact, the transmission mechanism is closer to H1N1 or influenza,"" said the minister.

>>Researchers at the National Centre for Infectious Diseases (NCID) have confirmed this, he said. Like influenza, COVID-19 is infectious when symptoms are mild, the researchers found.  Because of this transmission mechanism, COVID-19, like influenza, can spread ""quite quickly"", said the minister. […]

>>He cited a study by the WHO based on 17,000 patients, which found that 82 per cent had ""mild symptoms"", 15 per cent severe symptoms and 3 per cent had critical symptoms.  ""It is not a mild illness at all, but certainly not of the severity of SARS. These are the facts that we know about COVID-19 today,"" Mr Wong said. Because of the ""higher degree of infection"", experts believe COVID-19 may spread at a much faster rate than SARS, which means COVID-19 is more similar to H1N1.

>>If there is evidence of widespread community transmission in Singapore, Mr Wong said the Government could change its strategy on fighting the virus.  For instance, it could stop contact tracing because the large numbers make it impractical, and start sending confirmed COVID-19 cases with mild symptoms home to recover in isolation.

The announcement underpins signs that the virus data out of China is flawed.

Officials in the Hubei province, made up of 60 million people, reported more than 13,000 new cases when they expanded how they test patients from throat-swabs to more thorough examinations. The new cases brought the total count to nearly 60,000 infections from 45,000 on Wednesday. Most of those cases and all but one death have been in China.

A near-perfect 99.99% of variance is explained by the equation, this person said, referring to a statistical measure known as r-squared. That’s a fancy way of saying that the data updating the number of deaths was almost perfectly predictable. “This never happens with real data, which is always noisy,” the person said.

China’s U.S. embassy didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment.

*Barron’s* re-created the regression analysis of total deaths caused by the virus, which first emerged in the central Chinese city of Wuhan at the end of last year, and found the same variance. We ran it by Melody Goodman, associate professor of biostatistics at New York University’s School of Global Public Health.

“I have never in my years seen an r-squared of 0.99,” Goodman said. “As a statistician it makes me question the data.”

For context, Goodman said a “really good” r-squared, in terms of public health data, would be a 0.7. “Anything like 0.99,” she said “would make me think that someone is simulating data. It would mean you already know what is going to happen.”

There’s one scenario where the data could be understandably manipulated, Goodman said. Because there are privacy concerns around public health data, it’s conceivable that someone would simulate the data based on real data, so as not to make the data identifiable. But even then, the r-squared in this case is extraordinarily high. Moreover, Goodman said when data are manipulated to protect privacy, it would need to be disclosed; there is no such disclosure on the WHO site.

Some economists say there is [a longstanding measurement problem in China](https://www.barrons.com/articles/investors-arent-buying-chinas-fairy-tales-1437019422?mod=article_inline), irrespective of the coronavirus. Official economic statistics often differ from private attempts to replicate the results. The government-created purchasing-managers index was stronger than a closely watched private version during every month of 2019.

“It’s an emerging economy,” said Carl Weinberg, chief economist at High Frequency Economics. “There’s a natural roughness to the data.”

But questionable data makes forecasting the severity of the virus and economic hit in China and beyond that much harder.

Torsten Slok, chief economist at Deutsche Bank Securities, said he expects the outbreak to shave 1.5 percentage points off Chinese gross domestic product this year. He recently revised his 2020 GDP estimate for China to 4.6% from 6.1%, and he said he thinks the virus will take a 0.5 percentage point off global growth this year.

Estimates like Slok’s, of course, are based in part on data being supplied to the WHO by China."

At 11:12 UK time today on the live feed of the Guardian: 

As many as eight flights at Heathrow Airport were said to have been  caught up in delays or checks as a result of government health officials  responding to coronavirus-related concerns over passengers feeling  unwell.

United Airlines confirmed that staff in London had been providing  assistance to a flight from San Francisco which had landed at Heathrow  following reports of an individual becoming unwell onboard.

A man who had been on the flight said a passenger had been taken to  the back of the plane ahead of the arrival of health officials before  passengers were allowed to disembark after half-an-hour.

“There was an initial announcement that someone had taken ill and  would be taken off,” said Andy West, a public relations executive at  Hotwire, told the Guardian.

“Shortly afterwards he said that there was a suspected case of  coronavirus and that the passenger had been isolated at the back of the  plane.”"

And YOU were laid up in the hospital unable to breath or anything else the coronavirus is doing to your body as it slowly and painfully kills you, and you lie dying alone without your loved ones around you except for complete strangers in hazmat suits watching over you as you die. 

What do you think is going yo happen to your body? I doubt they'll return it to your family in one piece. They'll probably do what China is doing with the bodies of the coronavirus victims smand cremate your remains without your families consent before sending your ashes back to them.

As for your 'we have more flu deaths', you do know that there is a NEWER and DEADLIER strain flu out there thats WORSE than the one thats been around for decades. 

They have the two flus categories. The non lethal one is called Type A, that has been around for decades. The newer and deadlier one that you casually said we have more deaths from is Type B has been around since late 2018 so if course its going to have more deaths after two years compared to a vurus thats been around for 3-4 months. But at the rate the coronavirus is going with the number of deaths mounting up every day, its slowly catching up to where the death toll is for the flu virus currently is.

Its deadlier because by the time it was discovered everybody who had gone to the hospital and been diagnosed with testing positive for the flu, were assumed to have the Type A flu virus and were given the typical Type A meds to fight it, or went to the store to get the needed medicine.

But instead of getting better even with the Type A meds, they all got worse until they died slow painful deaths. Thats when they found out about the Type B virus. Its stronger than the Type A, and none of the normal meds are doing anything to stop it so far.

So if you think you have the flu, don't brush it off. Unless you want to risk DYING from a slow painful death you should rush to the nearest hospital and get tested immediately, to make sure you not only DO have the flu but also find out WHICH one it is and hope its the Type A flu instead of the Type B one."

He was a key member of the research team at the University of Hong Kong which isolated and characterized the novel SARS coronavirus in 2003. He’s been studying coronaviruses for 25 years (full bio here). The recording of the call can be found on our website HERE. Below are my notes transcribing the call. The first 30m are worth listening to.

>Quick summary: look at the fatality rate outside of Wuhan - it’s below 1%. The correct comparison is not SARS or MERS but a bad cold which kills people who already have other health issues. This virus will burn itself out in May when temperatures rise. Wash your hands.


In most estimates the effect on China in the first quarter of this will be big, maybe 1-2 annualized percentage points , but this will be mostly offset by above-trend growth during the rest of the year. The total over the year is estimated to be something between 0.5% to 1.2%. The impact on world GDP growth will be much smaller, maybe 0.15% or something like that.

The worst case scenarios from  epidemiology experts come when simple SIR model is used without taking into account anything else, like how weather  (sunlight, warmth, humidity) and  hygienic conditions in different countries change the infection rate. When you factor in everything that is known, and actions that are already taken it's likely that the epidemic starts to end around April or May when weather changes in China. 

The virus  is not  fast mutating, so this is not going to be like seasonal flu that goes around the world every year. There is just one big flare up and it spreads where it spreads during winter."

We have two “observation” units that we open during times of high census. At least one of them (and often both) is usually open consistently throughout the winter, even on weekends, since every floor is filled with respiratory patients. This year, one of them has been open a handful of days, and there have been maybe 5-7 days where both units were open.

By then it becomes a systemic infection.”

Kidney: It’s all connected

Yes, your kidneys are caught up in this mess, too. Six percent of SARS patients—and a full quarter of MERS patients—suffered acute renal injury. Studies have shown the novel coronavirus can do the same. It may be a relatively uncommon feature of the disease, but it is a fatal one. Ultimately 91.7 percent of SARS patients with acute renal impairment died, according to a 2005 study in Kidney International.

Like the liver, your kidneys act as a filter your blood. Each kidney is filled with about 800,000 of microscopic distilling units called nephrons. These nephrons have two main components: a filter to clean the blood and a little tubes that return the good stuff back to your body or send the waste down to your bladder as urine.

It’s the kidney tubules that seem to be most affected by these zoonotic coronaviruses. After the SARS outbreak, the WHO reported that the virus was found in kidney tubules, which can become inflamed.

It’s not uncommon to detect a virus in the tubules if it’s in your bloodstream, says Kar Neng Lai, a professor emeritus at the University of Hong Kong and consultant nephrologist at Hong Kong Sanatorium and Hospital. As your kidneys are continuously filtering blood, sometimes the tubular cells can trap the virus and cause a transient, or milder, injury.

How Flu Viruses Attack See how a flu virus attacks, mutates, and becomes contagious—perhaps resulting in an outbreak or even pandemic.

That injury could become lethal if the virus penetrates the cells and begins to replicate. But Lai—who was also a member of the first group of researchers reporting on SARS and contributed to the Kidney International study—says there was no evidence that the SARS virus was replicating in the kidney.

That finding, Lai says, suggests acute kidney injury in SARS patients might be due to a diverse set of causes, including low blood pressure, sepsis, drugs, or a metabolic disturbance. Meanwhile, the more severe cases that led to acute renal failure showed signs of—you guessed it—a cytokine storm.

Acute renal failure can also sometimes be brought on by antibiotics, multi-organ failure, or being connected to a ventilator for too long. Everything is connected.

Pregnancy and coronavirus?

It’s the great irony of the Twitter age that we know too little about the novel coronavirus as we drown in information updates about it. Medical journals have published several studies about this outbreak—some more vetted than others as researchers rush to feed the maw. Meanwhile, news outlets are reporting every development. All this information whirls around the internet where discerning fact from fiction is a notorious challenge.

“This is really unprecedented in terms of the up-to-the-minute reporting on what’s going on in these studies,” Rasmussen says. “It’s really tricky trying to sort through all of the information and figure out what’s really supported, what’s speculative, and what’s plain wrong.”

For example last week, doctors at a hospital in Wuhan reported that two infants tested positive for the novel coronavirus, one just 30 hours after birth. Naturally, this troubling headline spread across news organizations, given it raised questions of whether pregnant women can infect their unborn children in utero or whether the disease can be transmitted during birth or through breast milk.

But let’s pump the breaks. Mother-to-infant transmission wasn’t observed with SARS nor MERS despite numerous cases involving pregnant women. Plus, there are other ways a newborn could catch the coronavirus, Rasmussen says, such as by being born at hospital overrun with infected patients during a hectic emergency.

In fact, a new study published Thursday in The Lancet offers preliminary evidence that the coronavirus cannot be passed from mother to child.

In the report, researchers observed nine women in Wuhan who had COVID-19 pneumonia. Some of the women had pregnancy complications, but all cases resulted in live births without evidence of transmitting the infection. While this study doesn’t completely rule out the possibility of transmission during pregnancy, it underscores the need to exercise caution in speculating about this disease.

“There needs to be a high standard of evidence before you can say that’s happening definitively—and certainly before you start making changes to how cases are managed clinically or in terms of public policy,” Rasmussen says.

Frieman agrees. He hopes this epidemic will prompt more funding for coronavirus research like the recent pledges from the European Union and the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. But Frieman wants the support and interest to last even if this outbreak eventually fizzles out, unlike what happened with SARS research.

“Right after the SARS outbreak, there was a big bunch of money and then it went away,” Frieman says. “Why don’t we have these answers? Nobody funded these things.”"

The novel coronavirus that originated in Wuhan, China, is having a global impact, raising concerns about a pandemic.

To date, 15 cases of COVID-19 have been confirmed in the United States, according to the CDC. However, Sandro Cinti, MD, professor of internal medicine and infectious disease at Michigan Medicine, told Healio Primary Care that “it’s reasonable to say that there’s no need to panic at this point.”

Cinti noted that while there have been tens of thousands of COVID-19 cases in China, most people who acquire the disease will recover. **“Even if this were to become a pandemic, it would be difficult, but most people would do just fine,”** he said.

Cinti noted that “most of the spread isn’t from somebody you pass in the aisle at Kroger’s — it’s going to be somebody close to you who gets sick and you have to take care of.”

SYDNEY (AFP) - Top Australian universities warned on Friday (Feb 14) that Chinese students may walk away from courses Down Under after Canberra extended a coronavirus travel ban, in a major blow to the multi-billion-dollar sector.

Nearly 70,000 Chinese visa holders are due to start their semesters soon at eight top-ranked universities, but have been stuck since the bans started on Feb 1, said Ms Vicki Thomson, chief executive of Group of Eight, which represents the universities.

""We can't give our students any certainty as to when they can actually come here. So there is a risk of students choosing not to come here,"" Ms Thomson said.

""We are in quite unprecedented times and uncertain times.""

Prime Minister Scott Morrison announced on Thursday that the ban would be extended for at least another week, drawing the ire of China, which branded the move an ""overreaction"".

Ms Thompson warned that countries with competing universities, such as Britain and Canada, remain open to Chinese students and many people could look elsewhere.

Swelling Chinese enrolment numbers - up from fewer than 23,000 in 2003 during the Sars outbreak to more than 150,000 in 2018 - and the timing of the coronavirus at the start of the nation's academic year meant the impact was unprecedented, she said.

""Put all those factors together and, you know, it couldn't have happened at a worse time.""

International education was worth A$32.4 billion (S$30.3 billion) to the economy in 2017-18.

Top universities stand to lose around US$2 billion (S$2.8 billion) in fees alone, according to recent preliminary estimates by Standard & Poor's.

The virus has killed nearly 1,400 people and infected 64,000, mainly in China. As of Friday morning, 15 cases of the virus had been detected in Australia.

The economic impact of the virus, chasing a summer of devastating bush fires, is yet to be realised. Australia's central bank held interest rates at a record low last week.

""Obviously, the coronavirus will have an impact on the economy, (but) it is too early to quantify that impact,"" Finance Minister Mathias Cormann said on Friday."

They are both epidemiologists, and while one of them aims a pistol-like thermometer at every person getting off the plane, the other jots down their temperatures with a concerned look on her face. Afterward, they squirt hand sanitizer into each passenger's palms.

The new coronavirus, the World Health Organization (WHO) fears, could spread at any moment from China to Africa. Perhaps it has already arrived and is spreading, since many infected people only show mild symptoms. Maybe it's already making its way through a hospital, a market or an extended family.

""Africa has so many close connections to China, it is hard to imagine that there are no cases in Africa yet,"" says Peter Piot, the director of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, which cooperates closely with scientists in Africa. The fact that no infections have yet been identified there ""is really of big concern for me.""

On Friday, a first case of the disease was identified in Egypt. But there still have been no cases reported in WHO's Africa region. Egypt is officially part of the Eastern Mediterranean Region.

Many countries in Africa are not sufficiently prepared for SARS-CoV-2, the pathogen that causes the respiratory illness Covid-19, the name given by WHO this week to the condition that has already claimed more than 1,350 lives in China. As of Thursday, there were only 17 laboratories testing samples sent to them from the 47 countries within the WHO's ""African region"" -- far too few to cover all suspected cases.

""Without diagnostic testing,"" Piot says, it's impossible to know the extent of the spread of the virus and ""the infection may remain hidden for a while. Then you don’t have a chance to intervene early, because you don’t know where the problem actually is.""

It is becoming increasingly apparent that the number of confirmed cases reported to the WHO has been seriously understated in some places around the world. Even in Germany, the number of infections could be higher than the official tally of 16.

""It's conceivable that smaller, limited clusters [of infected people] exist that don't register on health officials' radar, even in Germany,"" says Gérard Krause, a renowned epidemiologist and department head at the Helmholtz Center for Infection Research in Braunschweig, Germany.

Just how incomplete the pool of data is, has been shown in China, where the system for registering new cases is completely overloaded. In the hardest-hit Chinese region of Hubei, authorities changed the way they counted new cases of Covid-19. Instead of only classing cases that have been confirmed by lab results, like they've been doing for the past few weeks, patients with chest infections revealed in CT scans are now also being counted. This resulted in the number of coronavirus infections jumping by 14,840, while the number of deaths rose by 242. The improved statistics give an idea of the degree to which the epidemic has been underestimated so far.

The official number of cases reported outside China is most likely inaccurate as well. The epidemiologist Moritz Krämer from the University of Oxford, who uses computer simulations to predict the spread of epidemics, is working with colleagues to comb through the websites of public health authorities around the world, making sure to take into account where infected people had traveled prior to being diagnosed. ""One in three infected people had traveled when they were already showing symptoms,"" Krämer says. ""That means thousands of sick people spread the virus around China and the world.""

Low Chance of Zero Infections

The fact that Indonesia, for instance, a very densely populated country with close ties to China, has not had a single confirmed case of Covid-19 is all but impossible, according to epidemiologists. The same goes for Thailand, where epidemiologists from the Harvard School of Public Health say that cases have almost certainly been overlooked.

A number of new infections in Singapore have also alarmed experts, according to the Wall Street Journal. Authorities were unable to determine how those affected contracted the disease.

""When something like this happens more often,"" Krause says, ""it shows us that we've been unable to stop the virus' spread.""

Most people got it and went back to their lives within a week even without treatment.

 We see cases with the coronavirus now that have a possible 14 day incubation period, a week of mild symptoms, and possibly a secondary infection a week or two later. We don't have many accounts of people who have fully recovered yet.

It also had a relatively low death rate, albeit slightly higher than the average flu. They also found similarities between the spanish flu and swine flu, could explain why older people somehow had less  severe symptoms. 

So i dunno... i think most people have had anxiety because of their fear of the unknown. It's not a family of viruses we have treatments for, we don't understand the symptoms or spread entirely, and the epicenter of the outbreak is controlled by a communist authoritarian regime that is more interested in saving face and retaining profits than sharing accurate information with the world."

All relevant epidemiological information suggests that it's no worse than the flu (which isn't to say it isn't a big deal, of course, as even the flu can be lethal to vulnerable populations),

In the timespan of a week, there have been about 40 deaths from flu in Greece alone. Assuming Greece has 10m people (actually less) and China 1 billion (actually more) Greece had alomst triple the deaths per capita from flu in a week than China had from coronavirus in total.

Here is the AMA full of deleted posts: https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/f2sedc/i_am_clo_junkie_moderator_of_this_and_other/

Anyone who participated in this AMA and said anything even slightly against the moderator or the sub, has been banned or will be. Many of these posts broke no rules, but were banned by newly added power-tripping mods. Isn't this enough proof to reddit admins that this subreddit is run by out of control moderators?

Over 28% of comments in the AMA have been removed by mods and the users banned, many permanently. http://www.removeddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/f2sedc/i_am_clo_junkie_moderator_of_this_and_other/

It is now one of the most censored posts on their subreddit and I think that's fitting to show just how corrupt they are.

Here are some comments that resulted in \*\*bans\*\*:

\>How did you get involved in leading the moderation team?

\_\_\_

\>What is your relationship to Reddit and how much are they compensating you or your organization?

\_\_\_

\>Genuinely curious—do you have a job outside of this or are you paid to moderate? It seems with the time invested it would be difficult to do another job. I don’t see it as a bad thing if you are paid, just curious. (Sorry if this has already been asked)

These were answered by CLO_Junkie and then 24 hours later the users were banned anyway.  It's outrageous to have an \*\*ask me anything\*\* and use it as a platform to ban the people who engaged with you, just because it didn't turn out how you liked."

On December 26, Zhang Jixian successively admitted to a number of patients with unexplained pneumonia.

On December 27, Zhang Jixian reported to the hospital, and the hospital quickly reported to the Jianghan District Center for Disease Control.

On the 27th and 28th, three patients were successively admitted, and Zhang Jixian reported again. The hospital attached great importance to reporting immediately.

On December 30, the Wuhan Health and Medical Commission issued a document to investigate and analyze cases of pneumonia of unknown cause, and requested to report it before 4 pm. At 5 pm, some doctors issued a statement in their classmates that “7 cases of SARS have been diagnosed in the South China market”, which was later updated to “Coronavirus, virus typing”, and reminded “Everyone should not spread the word and let family and loved ones pay attention to prevention” .

On December 31, the early morning epidemic prevention staff disinfected the South China market and did not close the market. On the morning of the same day, an expert group of the National Health Commission arrived in Wuhan to carry out related inspection and verification work. On the same day, relevant departments released news through the media, ""At present, the cause is not clear, and it cannot be concluded that it is the SARS virus rumored on the Internet. Other severe pneumonia is more likely.""

On January 1, the Jianghan District Market and Health Department jointly requested the South China Seafood Market to be closed."

I'll re-share this quote from Harvard Epedimiologist: ***""I think it is likely we'll see a global pandemic,"" said Mark Lipsitch, a professor of epidemiology at Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health. ""If a pandemic happens, 40% to 70% of people world wide are likely to be infected in the coming year. What proportion of those will be symptomatic, I can't give a good number.""***

Is he being sensationalist?  You're so convinced that this is going to blow over by summer, yet you're the one not sharing any logic or reason as to why you think that will be the case.

**Here is what we know:**

* **r0** is quite high for this disease. Estimates range from 2-5, but we are of course still very short on ***reliable*** data to analyze. That being said, we know this is very contagious, that much is obvious.
* Testing for this disease seems to pose a lot of challenges. There have been multiple instances where patients who tested negative later came back and tested positive, allowing them to spread the disease in the meantime.
   * Beyond this, mild cases don't appear very different from common flu or colds, and testing supplies are in a severe shortage in China.
   * While we don't have scientific confirmation, there is belief that this spreads asymptomatically, which makes it even more difficult to contain and stop
* Death rate is difficult to ascertain right now. Chinese data is not reliable since we don't know the ratio of dead to people who have this. Estimates range from 2% to 6-7%, but we simply aren't going to know this right away. We do know that young and healthy people have died from this. We also can reasonably believe that death rate is at least around 2%, making this both more infectious as well as more deadly than the 1918 spanish flu epidemic.
* Incubation period for this also poses another challenge for stopping the spread. With a long incubation time, it's tough to stop the travel of people before they start showing symptoms. This also explains some of the lags in this disease from the time of initial transmission to full outbreak elsewhere.

Make your own conclusions, but even based on the conservative estimates to other diseases, there are alot of serious risks here.  


>When you say ""not priced in"" what exactly are you expecting? 10 trillion in damages for something that will *likely* be resolved by summer? Frankly, 1 trillion worldwide was a fairly big move, and quite arguably fairly priced.

And indexes are already back to where they were previously (or higher in some instances). So that 10 trillion in damages has already been erased essentially. 

Regardless, I'm talking more about permanent impacts to the economy. A 3-5 % dip for 2-3 days does not represent something that could shut down the entire global supply chain, all at a time of very high valuations and tight spreads. 

When you halt major supply chains and also halt the world's biggest source of growth in the past 10 years, you get some very very large ripple effects. If this starts to spread elsewhere outside China as it currently is other parts of Asia, those ripples grow larger and larger."

My perspective on this is that I know a lot of people in Henan province and there’s 1212 infected there already. Henan and Hubei are extremely rural by Chinese standards (sort of like the Chinese West Virginia) and the people within Hubei will not do as well as those who are able to receive greater medical attention.

There have to many resource bottlenecks that will change outcomes in one place compared to another. It’s only within Wuhan compared to - say - Diamond Princess passengers that you would get a real comparison between how people inside central China fare compared to outside.

I’d think even in a place like South Sudan the very first coronavirus patients would get a very high quality of care compared to later victims."

The chinese makes some good cheap stuff.   I don't like that they took ALL of our manufacturing but it is what it is.  

However aircraft parts have to go through a specific approval process to be put on my airplane.  USED aircraft parts are another matter.  If it's something that is ""refurbished"" there are ALL SORTS of issues depending on how that particular part came to be able to be ""refurbished"".  Is it a part from another airplane that crashed?  If so is there a concern over metal fatigue due to impact forces.  Or is it an issue with an airplane that sat out in the elements too long and had rusted through.  Not as much an issue at the level I fly as most commercial aircraft I fly are not puddle jumpers sitting on the GA ramp and all my helicopters are hangered.  

I have never heard of used parts being refurbished on commercial aircraft.  I am not an A&P (airframe and power plant mechanic) but from everything I have heard if its broke, parts are not refurbished.  Sure you can overhaul an engine but the overhauled parts go in the bin never to be used again and likely smelted down for the metals.  As far as I know no one is going to put a cracked block back on a for hire passenger carrying aircraft (or are they?).

It started on Jan 25th this year so shipments stopping in January is expected, can't relate that to coronavirus.

 A pre-print published by Botao Xiao and Lei Xiao, titled ""The possible origins of 2019-nCoV coronavirus"" whose abstract is the following...

The 2019-nCoV has caused an epidemic of 28,060 laboratory-confirmed infections in human including 564 deaths in China by February 6, 2020. Two descriptions of the virus published on Nature this week indicated that the genome sequences from patients were almost identical to the Bat CoV ZC45 coronavirus. It was critical to study where the pathogen came from and how it passed onto human. An article published on The Lancet reported that 27 of 41 infected patients were found to have contact with the Huanan Seafood Market in Wuhan. We noted two laboratories conducting research on bat coronavirus in Wuhan, one of which was only 280 meters from the seafood market. We briefly examined the histories of the laboratories and proposed that the coronavirus probably originated from a laboratory. Our proposal provided an alternative origin of the coronavirus in addition to natural recombination and intermediate host.

In summary, somebody was entangled with the evolution of 2019-nCoV coronavirus. In addition to origins of natural recombination and intermediate host, the killer coronavirus probably originated from a laboratory in Wuhan. 

Who is Botao and should anyone listen to him? Well, yes: this is what we find about the research group of the Harvard post-doc:

The Xiao group study mainly in the fields of cellular and molecular biomechanics, single molecule biophysics and engineering. Current research areas are: protein-ligand interactions, DNA and RNA assembly, high-throughput nanometer measurements and manipulation, mathematical modeling and quantitative analysis. The experimental techniques include: magnetic tweezers, optical tweezers, biomembrane force probe, fluorescent microscopy, genetic engineering, and chromatography. An project example is using high-throughput single molecule techniques to study the modulation of protein drugs on interactions of integrins and their ligands such as TGF-beta. We also study von Willebrand Factor and glycoproteins on platelets. We collaborate with a number of well-known universities and institutions, and a few enterprises. Our research will be of relevance for the prevention and treatment of cancer, immune and cardiovascular diseases.

But what is far more interesting, and important, is that the paper was supported by China's National Natural Science Foundation, which means that the paper would likely never see the light of day if someone in Beijing did not stand to gain politically by endorsing the contrarian theory that a Wuhan biolab was indeed the source of the infection.

Which begs the question: is China's political elite set to change the narrative it has been spinning since day one about the origins of the coronavirus, and in order to appease an increasingly angry population, points the finger to one or more scientists at the Wuhan Center for Disease Control and Prevention and/or Wuhan Institute of Virology.

**BigBird Records**:

Of course is not complete! It would take 5 years in other countries

**Tekope**:

""There's still ongoing construction in the background"". Well it's only been a little more than a week, what do you expect??

**Paul Legge**:

Media trying to create a new ""crisis"" and ignoring the fact that thousands came together in a moments notice in an effort to help others.

**Kimi Zo**:

They are trying their very best. The least we can do is show our support and pray for them.

**Jasc Random**:

Those are Buildings with Prefabricated Parts, that's why they are build so fast. They are temporary, and are not intended to be permanent.

I think every country should have these in storage for in case of emergencies like this.

**Sean**:

What's the point? Are we supposed to be glad that they didn't complete in time? People dying there!!

**Andrew Ballard**:

They are trying though, with very significant effort...not entirely sure what the purpose of this report is :/

**Wen Lif**:

They never said its completed, they said its operational. Know the difference. At least they're trying.

**Max Waterman**:

Biased, sensationalist reporting, as usual. Move along.

**Darth_Eagle2042**:

Honestly this is so stupid, of course it's not done; other countries would take a year to do this

**LighteN Ing**:

So? You expect a 5star hotel w luxury interior design in 10 years?

**Elon Musk**:

You can still see construction behind this blue fence... 😭😂👏 that is a supremely stupid thing you just said

**Feral ML**:

I want to refund my 3 mins back pls thank u

**Chen hong**:

They built it to save human lives, while WSJ reports this just to show the arrogance. That's what I learnt.

**George Vera**:

So they are being critisized for doing a extraordinary task.

**Khalid Hamid**:

WSJ can't be supportive even on crisis times what a shame

**Jetstom Jetstom**:

Stop this is propaganda, these are not hospitals but Quarantine Centers only!!

**p world**:

why isnt the reporter on mask? 🙄

**Millicent Villanueva**:

So what if it's not yet finished?They are doing best in to finish the hospitals.For God's sake,give these people a break!!!!

**Sharif Ma**:

This is like the dumbest kid in class insulting the smartest kid in class for getting a 99% rather than 100% on the test.

The US literally can't even count votes in its own elections.

I never said that they were.. But even surgical masks, despite being of very little use keeping their *wearers* from getting sick, reduce the likelihood that sick people will infect others. We know this, because that is their exact function - to prevent surgeons from infecting their patients. Then, at least in theory, if we are comparing two populations A) a population where most people wear surgical masks and B) a population where no one wears surgical masks, then it's safe to say that an airborne disease like Coronavirus will spread more easily in B than A. This is particularly helpful when we have a disease that can infect people asymptomatically, because telling people to simply stay home if they feel sick will not stop the spread of the disease.

And of course, that's just surgical masks. N95 masks, when properly fit, actually protect the wearer as well as others. While they may be a bit more than the average person needs, I see no reason why people who interact with many others as a part of their job - medical professionals, taxi/uber drivers, etc - shouldn't have n95s, as that may prevent the creation of ""supercarriers"" of the disease.

So, I think it is foolish for any government to advise against wearing masks, as doing so stigmatizes their use, thus making its citizens more vulnerable to an airborne infectious illness as a population."

A lot.
You would expect that we would have already started seeing more deaths by now.In my area we had a wave of illness go through around the last week of December.Everyone had different symptoms;the guy I got it from was older.He had it go into his lungs for about a week.He's still coughing as of my last work day.I only felt like a cold for a day and was lethargic for 2 days.Another guy said his whole family had it with different symptoms;one had vomitingand diarrhea,one had head cold,one had flu symptoms.
 Whatever it was,it spread fast.
If the coronavirus moves as fast as they imply,we should be seeing more deaths.
It would have made it here long before anyone even thought of travel restrictions.
I think it's being overlooked or they're dealing with something other than a virus over there."

However, suicide is an ultimate/unforgivable sin. 

So in the case of this meme, the guy thought he was sacrificing his life to prevent his family getting ill which would normally result in him getting into heaven. However, since he didn’t actually have the Coronavirus, you could view it as a pointless suicide. This would result in him getting Detroit smashed down to hell.

Personally, I’d imagine god (or whoever) would appreciate what the man was trying to do and cut him some slack. Either way, there is a joke here.

Tons of evidence for the massive amount of 50¢ trolls on these subs. One thing I've noticed is a lot of them have usernames that are two random words together. CLO_junkie and DonkeyTonk come to mind first. There are lots more.

Summary

Our assessment shows that the coronavirus is more analogous to a more contagious and stronger flu than it is to other deadlier viruses.

How Serious Is the Coronavirus, Really?

As we have received a lot of questions on and challenges to our previous article on the coronavirus – and since many of these relate to evidence supporting our optimism regarding the situation – we decided to write another piece on this topic with more numerical analysis to show how our conclusions have been drawn. To reinforce the credibility of the analysis, note that all the cited numbers related to the coronavirus situation are from U.S. resources, such as Johns Hopkins CSSE or the U.S. Center of Diseases Control (CDC).

The first or the most fundamental question people are asking regards the actual severity of the virus. Our conclusion, based on our own assessment of the situation, is that the coronavirus is a highly contagious but relatively low-mortality-rate virus.

First of all, to reiterate, it's definitely highly contagious. According to various sources on this, the transmissibility of the coronavirus (indicated by R0) is around 4. As a comparison, the R0 for the common flu is 1.3 and for SARS it was 2. We think this is well acknowledged by governments around the globe, given how quickly and seriously they have been taking preventive actions.

But it's not that deadly, at least for now. It's been about two months since the first reported case of the coronavirus infection on Dec. 8 in Wuhan, China. The most recent number (as of Feb. 13) of total confirmed cases is 60,364, of which 59,826 have been in mainland China and 548 have been outside of China. The total confirmed death toll so far is 1,370, with only three deaths recorded outside of mainland China.

People might draw the conclusion that the virus’ mortality rate is about 2% based on the numbers so far, which we think is misleading and not informative at all:

First of all, the majority of infections (48,206 out of the 59,830, or 80%) and deaths (1,310 out of 1,367, or 96%) in China have occurred within Hubei Province, where the virus was first detected. If we separate these cases from those outside that region, we calculate mortality rates of 2.7% for Hubei Province and 0.4% for other parts of China. There is a very legitimate – and at the same time tragic – reason behind the abnormally high mortality rate for Hubei Province: the mandatory quarantine of the region imposed by the Chinese central government.

The number of patients exploded in a short period and medical supplies were insufficient to address the situation, so the higher-than-average mortality rate is unsurprising.

Many of the deaths reported have been people with other health issues, such as lung problems or heart disease. For people who are young and healthy, the mortality rate is much lower. This also explains why we are seeing a rapid rise in the number of recovered patients.
For regions outside China, we don't think the number of cases is high enough to reach a meaningful conclusion on the true mortality rate. But with three coronavirus deaths outside mainland China, we tend to think the ex-China situation is not concerning to any extent.

Scientists at USAMRID, the U.S. Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious diseases, work with some of the most deadly forms of life on earth, killer viruses. Learn more.

Some viruses are picky about which door they choose, but others are a little more promiscuous. “They can very easily penetrate into all types of cells,” says Anna Suk-Fong Lok, assistant dean for clinical research at the University of Michigan Medical School and former president of the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases.

Both SARS and MERS viruses can access the cells that line your intestines and large and small colon, and those infections appear to flourish in the gut, potentially causing the damage or the leakage of fluid that becomes diarrhea.

But Frieman says we don’t know yet if the novel coronavirus does the same. Researchers believe COVID-19 uses the same receptor as SARS, and this doorway can be found in your lungs and small intestines.

Two studies—one in the New England Journal of Medicine and one preprint in medRxiv involving 1,099 cases—have also detected the virus in stool samples, which might indicate the virus could spread via feces. But this is far from conclusive.

“Whether that kind of fecal transmission is occuring for this Wuhan virus, we don’t know at all,” Frieman says. “But it definitely looks like it’s there in the stool and it looks like people do have GI symptoms associated with this.”

Blood storm

Coronaviruses can also cause problems in other systems of the body, due to the hyperactive immune response we mentioned earlier.

A 2014 study showed that 92 percent of patients with MERS had at least one manifestation of the coronavirus outside of the lungs. In fact, signs of a full body blitz have been witnessed with all three of the zoonotic coronaviruses: elevated liver enzymes, lower white blood cell and platelet count, and low blood pressure. In rare cases, patients have suffered from acute kidney injury and cardiac arrest.

But this isn’t necessarily a sign that the virus itself is spreading throughout the body, says Angela Rasmussen, a virologist and associate research scientist at Columbia University Mailman School of Public Health. It might be a cytokine storm.

   Basically you’re bleeding out of your blood vessels.

Angela Rasmussen, virologist

Cytokines are proteins used by the immune system as alarm beacons—they recruit immune cells to the site of infection. The immune cells then kill off the infected tissue in a bid to save the rest of the body.

Humans rely on our immune systems to keep their cool when facing a threat. But during a runaway coronavirus infection, when the immune system dumps cytokines into the lungs without any regulation, this culling becomes a free-for-all, Rasmussen says “Instead of shooting at a target with a gun, you’re using a missile launcher,” she says. That’s where the problem arises: Your body is not just targeting the infected cells. It is attacking healthy tissue too.

The implications extend outside the lungs. Cytokine storms create inflammation that weakens blood vessels in the lungs and causes fluid to seep through to the air sacs. “Basically you’re bleeding out of your blood vessels,” Rasmussen says. The storm spills into your circulatory system and creates systemic issues across multiple organs.

From there, things can take a sharp turn for the worse. In some of the most severe COVID-19 cases, the cytokine response—combined with a diminished capacity to pump oxygen to the rest of the body—can result in multi-organ failure. Scientists don’t know exactly why some patients experience complications outside of the lung, but it might be linked to underlying conditions like heart disease or diabetes.

“Even if the virus doesn’t get to kidneys and liver and spleen and other things, it can have clear downstream effects on all of those processes,” Frieman says. And that’s when things can get serious.

When a zoonotic coronavirus spreads from the respiratory system, your liver is often one downstream organ that suffers. Doctors have seen indications of liver injury with SARS, MERS, and COVID-19—often mild, though more severe cases have led to severe liver damage and even liver failure. So what’s happening?

“Once a virus gets into your bloodstream, they can swim to any part of your body,” Lok says. “The liver is a very vascular organ so \[a coronavirus\] can very easily get into your liver.”

Your liver works pretty hard to make sure your body can function properly. Its main job is to process your blood after it leaves the stomach, filtering out the toxins and creating nutrients your body can use. It also makes the bile that helps your small intestine break down fats. Your liver also contains enzymes, which speed up chemical reactions in the body.

In a normal body, Lok explains, liver cells are constantly dying off and releasing enzymes into your bloodstream. This resourceful organ then quickly regenerates new cells and carries on with its day. Because of that regeneration process, the liver can withstand a lot of injury.

When you have abnormally high levels of enzymes in your blood, though—as has been a common characteristic of patients suffering from SARS and MERS—it’s a warning sign. It might be a mild injury that the liver will quickly bounce back from or it could be something more severe—even liver failure.

Lok says scientists don’t completely understand how these respiratory viruses behave in the liver. The virus might be directly infecting the liver, replicating and killing off the cells itself. Or those cells might be collateral damage as your body’s immune response to the virus sets off a severe inflammatory reaction in the liver."

The claim is made by doctors working in the Hubei Province capital that is at the center of the epidemic, which has to date infected 64,201 people and killed 1,487. One of the doctors reached out to a relative living in the United Kingdom, who then informed Taiwan News.

Both the relative and doctors asked to remain anonymous, out of consideration they might face retribution from the Chinese authorities. The doctor, Li Wenliang (李文亮), who first raised warnings about the Wuhan virus, was rebuked by the authorities before succumbing to the devastating disease himself earlier this month.

According to the message forwarded to Taiwan News, “It’s highly possible to get infected a second time. A few people recovered from the first time by their own immune system, but the meds they use are damaging their heart tissue, and when they get it the second time, the antibody doesn’t help but makes it worse, and they die a sudden death from heart failure.”
The source also said the virus has “outsmarted all of us,” as it can hide symptoms for up to 24 days. This assertion has been made independently elsewhere, with Chinese pulmonologist Zhong Nanshan (鍾南山) saying the average incubation period is three days, but it can take as little as one day and up to 24 days to develop symptoms.

Also, the source said that false negative tests for the virus are fairly common. “It can fool the test kit – there were cases that they found, the CT scan shows both lungs are fully infected but the test came back negative four times. The fifth test came back positive.”
According to the BBC and other media outlets, some laboratory tests are incorrectly telling people they are virus-free. There is also anecdotal evidence of people having up to six negative results before being diagnosed correctly.
Dr. Li Wenliang first raised concerns about this. His own test results had come back negative multiple times before he was finally diagnosed.

False negative tests raise question marks over how many people have the Wuhan coronavirus, with many believing the Chinese authorities have massively underreported the number of cases and deaths. Meanwhile, the official methodology for diagnosing the virus in China was changed this week, leading to a sudden leap in the number of recorded cases and deaths."

HIV is also a virus. Yes.

Does this mean that Coronavirus can behave like HIV? Absolutely not. 

And don’t start with the „it has HIV genes in it!!!11“ This is true, yes. But it is a mere coincidence. The Virus is a combination of over 30.000 nucleic acids. (Long for viruses, but not tooooo unusual!) 


Of course there are some parts that resemble other viruses. RNA consists only of 4 „building blocks“, hence the possibility of random similar sections in a row of over 30.000 „blocks“ to other viruses. 


Never heard the story that we share x% of our genes with potatoes? Same principle. 

Are you a potato? Subjectively that answer may be yes for some people, but we simply aren‘t.


This is just very simplified for better understanding.


To come back to the topic: Coronavirus does not stay in your body, because your body is fortunately producing antibodies that fight the virus. Which does not happen at all with HIV.

Hope that helped."

>Donald Milton, MD, a professor of environmental health at the University of Maryland, helped prove via the use of his Gesundheit machine that influenza could be spread via aerosol transmission. He said he is in contact with colleagues in Singapore who are attempting to study the transmission of the COVID-19 viruses, which are often called nCoV, for novel coronavirus.

>Though Chinese officials said earlier this week that they believe the coronavirus is transmitted only via droplets, implying they do not believe airborne or contact transmission plays a role, **Milton said that statement is likely rooted in fear, not science.**

>**""To me this sounds like someone trying to deal with panic, because people panic when they hear airborne transmission and long-distance transmission,"" he said. He said there has been scientific evidence of aerosol transmission of MERS-CoV (Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus), so it is likely possible for this novel coronavirus, as well.**

>Milton cautions that the difference between aerosol and droplet transmission is largely in name only. Respiratory droplets, emitted with a sneeze or a cough, are commonly thought to land within 6 feet of patients and are too large to be buoyant on air currents. Respiratory aerosols are droplets too, Milton said, but smaller and light enough to travel farther.

>""You cannot tell the difference epidemiologically between something aerosol transmitted by weak sources and large droplet spray,"" said Milton. ""They behave so similar, it's very hard to pick up the difference.""

But it is worth remembering a few things.   


First off, the figure of 15% of cases in China that are serious. It seems very likely that the only cases that are being identified in China are already fairly progressed cases. They're not wasting testing kits with thousands infected on people with mild or no symptoms. I imagine mostly people who feel sick enough to go to the hospital - knowing it will be full of coronavirus patients! - are being identified. The ""clinical diagnosis"" for coronavirus shows up on a chest x-ray. If there are mild cases, they won't be showing up on that x-ray, they won't be going to the hospitals. But then there is also a time lag between cases starting up and cases becoming very serious. So it's a similar story with the fatality rate - we have a couple factors that could go either way.  


Secondly with the cruise. While the healthcare system there isn't overwhelmed and you'd expect better data, it's worth pointing out that they still haven't tested everybody on board - again, to some extent I imagine people with clear symptoms are being tested. And I also believe that over half of the people on board were over 65 - lots of retirees like cruises - and it may well be the case that a higher proportion of those cases become serious.   


Hopefully the serious caseload is very low compared to the total number infected. But ultimately, if the total number infected is high enough, it will still be enough to overwhelm medical systems, so no room for complacency here."

I refute your statement, and ask you to consider the referenced quotes below.

A summary quote: [""The palpable impact of SARS was translated into action in the form of pandemic influenza planning and surveillance efforts, a greater focus on global health security, improved laboratory and surveillance networks, and most important, the revision of the International Health Regulations, the IHR.""](https://www2c.cdc.gov/podcasts/media/pdf/EID_6_13_SARS_10_Yrs_Later.pdf)

Identification, response and retrospective analysis of past outbreaks, particularly SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and the 2009 H1N1 pandemic, have been instrumental in guiding the response to emergence of new (novel) diseases, including:

\- surveillance of linfluenza-like illnes (ILI) and severe acute respiratory illness (SARI);

Quote: [""Prior to the 2009–2010 pandemic, no global standard for SARI had been developed for wide implementation.""](https://www.who.int/bulletin/volumes/96/2/17-194514.pdf?ua=1)

\- utilising case definitions to find suspected and confirmed (clinical or laboratory) cases;

Quote: [""Development of a clear case definition is critical to effective investigation of an outbreak. Use of a common case definition allows for standardization of the cases of interest both within an ongoing outbreak investigation and possibly between outbreak investigations that differ over time or geographic location.""](https://www.cdc.gov/urdo/downloads/casedefinitions.pdf)

\- potential treatment protocol;

Quote: [""This is the first edition of this document for novel coronavirus, an adaption of WHO Clinical management of severe acute respiratory infection when MERS-CoV infection is suspected publication (2019).""](https://www.who.int/publications-detail/clinical-management-of-severe-acute-respiratory-infection-when-novel-coronavirus-(ncov)-infection-is-suspected)

\- International Health Regulations (IHR), focused on reducing international spread of disease;

Quote: ""[IHR grew from International Sanitary Conference](https://www.who.int/trade/distance_learning/gpgh/gpgh8/en/index7.html) (**1851**), recognising that:

* free movement of people and goods will increase the risk of cross-border transmission 
* quarantine is an impediment to free trade 
* public health arguments can justify trade barriers 
* International Health Regulations (1950) responsibility of WHO: Member States agree to notify specific infectious diseases & abide by measures allowed by countries to protect themselves.""

Quote: ""[The IHR (2005)](https://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/handle/10665/246107/9789241580496-eng.pdf;jsessionid=9597E0BFC12575C04BE95419ED3AC5D0?sequence=1)contain a range of innovations, including: (a) **a scope not limited to any specific disease or manner of transmission, but covering “illness or medical condition, irrespective of origin or source, that presents or could present significant harm to humans**”

\- lessons from SARS:

[Surviving a life-threatening crisis: Taiwan's nurse leaders' reflections and difficulties fighting the SARS epidemic.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19207797)

[SARS: how to manage future outbreaks?](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16830006)

Quote: ""This paper highlights how we can apply our knowledge of its epidemiology, mode of transmission, clinical course, ICU admission, complications, predictors of poor outcome, treatment and infection control to help us avert a catastrophic outbreak, and to manage our resources and patients. SARS preparedness and response planning must be flexible and dynamic so that appropriate measures can be implemented as an outbreak progresses. **Even if SARS does not reemerge, the experience gained from such planning is valuable in preparing for threats of bioterrorism or a global avian influenza A (H5N1) virus pandemic.""**"

""The 2019-nCoV has caused an epidemic of 28,060 laboratory-confirmed infections in human including 564 deaths in China by February 6, 2020. Two descriptions of the virus published on Nature this week indicated that the genome sequences from patients were almost identical to the Bat CoV ZC45 coronavirus. It was critical to study where the pathogen came from and how it passed onto human. An article published on The Lancet reported that 27 of 41 infected patients were found to have contact with the Huanan Seafood Market in Wuhan. We noted two laboratories conducting research on bat coronavirus in Wuhan, one of which was only 280 meters from the seafood market. We briefly examined the histories of the laboratories and proposed that the coronavirus probably originated from a laboratory. Our proposal provided an alternative origin of the coronavirus in addition to natural recombination and intermediate host."""

Of those ~64,000 formally diagnosed coronavirus cases, only ~6,800 have had their condition resolve.  Another ~1,400 have died.  That makes for ~8,200 resolved cases and another ~55,800 cases pending resolution.

Neither of us can make a good comparison for IRF/CRF with Ebola at this point because we don’t know what’s going to happen to those 55.8k people.

Pretending the Coronavirus is a nothingburger, at this point, is dangerous.  It’s a highly contagious, lethal, novel virus.  I pray that it’s less lethal than Ebola, but that doesn’t make it safe.

He said it himself, he's trying to look out for himself, and while he probably didn't mean to send you into a panic attack (I feel like) he was trying to make you uncomfortable.

Insufficient attention was paid to the information doctors had gathered about the genetic sequence of the novel coronavirus, scientists said in a commentary paper in the Lancet medical journal Tuesday. The authors, who include two [members](https://www.who.int/ihr/procedures/novel-coronavirus-2019/ec-22012020-members/en/) of the World Health Organization’s emergency committee, said this wasn’t the result of a cover-up or deliberate delay, but rather the absence of mechanisms to inform outbreak warning systems. 

“To be fair to the authorities, I think all national responses would do what the Chinese did,” said Lin Fa Wang, one of the four authors of the Lancet paper. “This is not a cover up or delay, this is all about policy and ‘rules of engagement’ for reporting. I hope people focus on the lessons learned.”

 “However, the genome sequence -- crucial for rapid development of diagnostics needed in an outbreak response -- was not released until Jan. 12, 17 days after the preliminary sequence data were obtained,” the authors said.

[Based on the best stats we have for the disease](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.02.10.20021675v1):

* World population is 7.7 billion
* **4,620,000,000** infected
* **138,600,000** will die even if they receive the best medical attention at 2% mortality rate
   * This is **294 times the annual flu death**
* **1,155,000,000** will develop severe pneumonia and face death unless they receive hospitalization
   * **Note:** We do not have enough hospitals for 1.1 billion people, a good amount of those people will die. This is the 'scary part'. One or two infections can be treated, but in places where the infection takes a foothold, the medical system is overwhelmed and people who could have lived end up dying.
   * Assuming only one quarter of the people with severe pneumonia die due to lack of medical attention (extreme lowball) this is an additional **288,750,000 deaths** or **614 years of flu deaths.**
* **3,229,380,000** will have mild pneumonia, taking weeks to recover and will be vulnerable to secondary infections caused by [lymphopenia onset by the virus](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(20)30183-5/fulltext).

Being prepared and treating this like the danger it is, is the only reason more people aren't being infected than the current alarming rate. People need to understand and appreciate the sheer danger if it spreads. Right now [6.5% of the entire world's population](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2020-02-15/coronavirus-lockdown-in-china-6.5-per-cent-worlds-population/11968114) is in lockdown to prevent further spread and that's still failing, [WHO is expected to declare it a pandemic](https://www.sciencealert.com/scientists-think-the-wuhan-coronavirus-might-soon-be-declared-a-pandemic). Compared to the experts, you and I are morons. The experts are concerned, you should be. Hopefully a vaccine is created while people like you learn to take it seriously, prepare, and do everything they can to mitigate the spread or otherwise you're looking at **more people dying than over 1,000 years** of the flu. ***Otherwise this will be a fantastic example of natural selection against humans that don't understand how to appropriately use statistics.***"

An offshore worker on a North Sea platform has been quarantined over concerns around the outbreak of the coronavirus.

The worker, on board Taqa’s Tern Alpha installation 105 miles north-east of Shetland, has presented “minor symptoms after returning recently from holiday in Thailand”.

Taqa said the individual is being “attended to by the medic on board” and is “remaining separated from the crew until the results of the tests are known”.

A helicopter crew change was due to arrive at the Tern today but it is understood that was diverted at the discretion of the helicopter operator.

Quarantine is a standard procedure on Taqa installations for outbreaks of other viral illnesses like flu.


A spokeswoman added that Taqa has now put travel restrictions in place to its offshore platforms by workers who have returned to countries hit by the virus, joining fellow operator Chrysaor who has also imposed similar restrictions.

In an email seen by Energy Voice, Chrysaor said workers returning from China’s Hubei Province cannot go offshore for 14 days and should go into self-imposed quarantine.

The operator also placed similar restrictions on anyone experiencing a cough or fever that has recently returned from Far East countries including China, Thailand, Japan, Korea, Singapore and Malaysia, among others.

Chrysaor, the largest producer of oil and gas in the UK North Sea, said it was taking “prudent” steps to reduce the risk to its people and offshore installations.


Other firms, including BP and Halliburton, have issued company-wide policies preventing non-essential travel to China and the wider Asia-Pacific region respectively.

Oil services company Schlumberger has also put travel restrictions in place.

A Taqa spokeswoman said: “A member of crew on board our Tern Alpha platform has presented with minor symptoms after returning recently from holiday in Thailand.

“The individual is being attended to by the medic on board the platform and as a precaution he is remaining separated from the rest of the crew until the results of tests are known.

“Both the individual and Taqa continue to take the appropriate actions and precautions in line with the UK Government guidelines.

“Taqa is working closely with the relevant authorities and has put in place travel restrictions to its offshore platforms by individuals who have travelled recently to countries identified by the UK Government.”"

If you’re talking about actual schools that operate on a semester basis, they follow a similar calendar to what you’d see in most of the Western world (i.e. August/ September start). Unless they have summer classes, they tend to recruit through the end of Spring for a fall start. These sorts of 9-5 teaching jobs are usually quite competitive and generally require at least a couple years of teaching experience, but depending on what subject your Masters is in, you could possibly find something. Most of the TEFL jobs in Vietnam that are open to first year teachers, however, are at English centers, which generally hire year round (although the current Coronavirus related closures could definitely affect that).

2. If you’re able to secure a position at a bilingual school, that wouldn’t be a problem. They recruit for the new school year a few month out. Training centers on the other hand are usually looking for an immediate start, but can always enter on a tourist visa, spend some time getting familiar with the city and start applying for jobs once you’re more settled. If all of your documents are authenticated and ready to go, then the visa process in Vietnam is pretty streamlined as long as you find an employer willing to sponsor your work permit. There’s also a 30 day grace period during which you’re allowed to work on a tourist visa as long as your company’s in the process of applying for your work permit/ TRC, so I wouldn’t worry too much about that."

SYDNEY (AFP) - Top Australian universities warned on Friday (Feb 14) that Chinese students may walk away from courses Down Under after Canberra extended a coronavirus travel ban, in a major blow to the multi-billion-dollar sector.

Nearly 70,000 Chinese visa holders are due to start their semesters soon at eight top-ranked universities, but have been stuck since the bans started on Feb 1, said Ms Vicki Thomson, chief executive of Group of Eight, which represents the universities.

""We can't give our students any certainty as to when they can actually come here. So there is a risk of students choosing not to come here,"" Ms Thomson said.

""We are in quite unprecedented times and uncertain times.""

Prime Minister Scott Morrison announced on Thursday that the ban would be extended for at least another week, drawing the ire of China, which branded the move an ""overreaction"".

Ms Thompson warned that countries with competing universities, such as Britain and Canada, remain open to Chinese students and many people could look elsewhere.

Swelling Chinese enrolment numbers - up from fewer than 23,000 in 2003 during the Sars outbreak to more than 150,000 in 2018 - and the timing of the coronavirus at the start of the nation's academic year meant the impact was unprecedented, she said.

""Put all those factors together and, you know, it couldn't have happened at a worse time.""

International education was worth A$32.4 billion (S$30.3 billion) to the economy in 2017-18.

Top universities stand to lose around US$2 billion (S$2.8 billion) in fees alone, according to recent preliminary estimates by Standard & Poor's.

The virus has killed nearly 1,400 people and infected 64,000, mainly in China. As of Friday morning, 15 cases of the virus had been detected in Australia.

The economic impact of the virus, chasing a summer of devastating bush fires, is yet to be realised. Australia's central bank held interest rates at a record low last week.

""Obviously, the coronavirus will have an impact on the economy, (but) it is too early to quantify that impact,"" Finance Minister Mathias Cormann said on Friday."

You can’t get your money back and you can’t get your time back either so you have to make the best of it.

1. Your degree may be valuable in teaching English to Asian students specifically Japan, China, and Korea.

It’s very lucrative and they usually pay all or most of your expenses. With the degree you may be able to get the higher level teaching jobs so look into that.

There’s Coronavirus in China right now so avoid China but look seriously at Japan and Korea.

One of the companies for Japan is JETS - Japanese English Teaching Something 

Another one is VIPKid

There are others look them up.

An American with a degree in English should be virtually guaranteed to get it.

2. Teaching English will only tide you over for maybe 3 years max. You need solid useful skills that translate into money reliably so use this time to learn some. It can be any skill that is likely to be in demand eg coding or something else 

3. Sending out tons of applications doesn’t really help. It’s better to send out a few targeted applications you spent some time lining up.

Eg if you see a job like Research Associate, take some time to figure out who is the Research Manager of that company then find out their email.

Many companies use the same format so with some google Kung fu you can figure it out.

Some are Firstname.Lastname @ company .com

FLastname @ company .com

Etc.

When you find out, apply but also email that person introducing yourself, letting them know you just applied and explaining why you think you’d be a good fit, then end it by saying you’d like to interview with times you’re available, your phone number and sign off.

This method is far better at getting a real response than spray and pray but the opportunity cost is you send out fewer but higher quality applications.

Also ask friends to introduce you to people hiring at their office etc

3. Applying to 100 jobs over 2 years is very low. That’s only 50 jobs a year so less than 1 job a week. You should be applying to 10 jobs a week.

4. Applying in person is a waste of time. Just apply online. 

Make sure your resume is well done and pleasant.

This should be a good start."

> U.S. President Donald Trump has praised Chinese President Xi Jinping&#039;s leadership in China&#039;s battle to contain the virus, and his administration has said it stands ready to spend up to $100 million to assist China and other countries impacted by coronavirus.

> &quot;Now one potential problem is, given the United States&#039; comprehensive ban on people&#039;s coming and going between China and the U.S. Now objectively, this will bring some difficulties to implementing this agreement,&quot; Wang said.

First paragraph:

""Abstract
The novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) is a recently emerged human pathogen that has spread widely since January 2020. Initially, the basic reproductive number, R0, was estimated to be 2.2 to 2.7. Here we provide a new estimate of this quantity. We collected extensive individual case reports and estimated key epidemiology parameters, including the incubation period. Integrating these estimates and high-resolution real-time human travel and infection data with mathematical models, we estimated that the number of infected individuals during early epidemic double every 2.4 days, and the R0 value is likely to be between 4.7 and 6.6. We further show that quarantine and contact tracing of symptomatic individuals alone may not be effective and early, strong control measures are needed to stop transmission of the virus."""

Theory numero uno, a bunch of rogue admin including clo\_junkie are on some bizarre power trip and ruining it for everyone else. Since they control both subs (r/china\_flu and r/Coronavirus), they control the flow of information. This theory is backed by obvious correlation between unjust bans and users discussing the matter in 3rd party subs, meaning the mods are spending their days tracking what you say in other subs and banning you based on whether or not they find your opinions (and probably political opinions) palatable... or not.

Theory number two, this is actually a behavior supported by reddit inc themselves, who have vested interests since Chinese corps put 150m usd in them last year. In other words, reddit backs the mods who behave like this because as far as their concerned, only one viewpoint is acceptable. This theory is backed by circumstantial evidence that reporting the mods for being 'bad mods' has led some users to have their reddit account erased completely, and more convincing evidence that reddit is being awfully slow in resolving a major mod issue on one of the 'hot button' topics subs of the year. This is also backed by a PR campaign where reddit prides themselves of 'enlisting the community to curb misinformation' (you are the misinformation in this case by the way), and finally the 150m they did indeed receive from China last year.

Personally, I hesitate between the two, but based on how reddit inc behaves in general and the more i study and learn, the more I think theory number 2 is the correct one."

In testimony yesterday before the Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs, Scott Gottlieb, a physician and the former Food and Drug Administration commissioner in the Trump administration, explained in detail the extent of the U.S. pharmaceutical industry’s dependence on China:

About 40 percent of generic drugs sold in the U.S. have only a single manufacturer. A significant supply chain disruption could cause shortages for some of many of these products.

Last year, manufacturing of intermediate or finished goods in China, as well as pharmaceutical source material, accounted for 95 percent of U.S. imports of ibuprofen, 91 percent of U.S. imports of hydrocortisone, 70 percent of U.S. imports of acetaminophen, 40 to 45 percent of U.S. imports of penicillin, and 40 percent of U.S. imports of heparin, according to the Commerce Department. 

In total, 80 percent of the U.S. supply of antibiotics are made in China.

While much of the fill finishing work (the actual formulation of finished drug capsules and tablets) is done outside China (and often in India) the starting and intermediate chemicals are often sourced in China. 

Moreover, the U.S. generic drug industry can no longer produce certain critical medicines such as penicillin and doxycycline without these chemical components.

According to a report from the US-China Economic and Security Review Commission, China’s chemical industry, which accounts for 40 percent of global chemical industry revenue, provides a large number of ingredients for drug products. 

It’s these source materials — where in many cases China is the exclusive source of the chemical ingredients used for the manufacture of a drug product — that create choke points in the global supply chain for critical medicines.

Moreover, when it comes to starting material for the manufacture of pharmaceutical ingredients, a lot of this production is centered in China’s Hubei Provence, the epicenter of coronavirus. 

Most drug makers have a one to three-months of inventory of drug ingredients on hand. But these supplies are already being drawn down. 

Among big [active pharmaceutical ingredient] makers in Wuhan are Wuhan Shiji Pharmaceutical, Chemwerth, Hubei Biocause, Wuhan Calmland Pharmaceuticals."

Same thing with this illegal animal trade. China says it's wrong, but they Won't Stop It.

The original comment I made and will continue arguing for is that OP's idea is stupid. You responded about how it's not stupid because of some unrelated garbage, which has nothing to do with the actual topic, OP's idea.

The reason OP's idea is stupid is because antivaxxers do not deny that viruses exist. There's no reason they should, or would, if encouraged, take care of Chinese people with coronavirus because they recognize that they would get infected. Antivaxxers as a group do not think they are any less susceptible to getting viruses or diseases than the general population, they simply don't want to get vaccinated. There's probably some crossover between antivaxxers and crystal / essential oil fanatics, but those individuals' beliefs are separate from the fact that they are antivaxxers.

Fang Bin, a local clothing salesman, peered inside as he walked past. He groaned: “So many dead.” He counted five, six, seven, eight body bags. “This is too many.”  

That moment, in a 40-minute video about the coronavirus outbreak that has devastated China, propelled Mr. Fang to internet fame. Then, less than two weeks later, he disappeared.

Days earlier, another prominent video blogger in Wuhan, Chen Qiushi, had also gone missing. Mr. Chen’s friends and family said they believed he had been forcibly quarantined.

Before their disappearances, Mr. Fang and Mr. Chen had recorded dozens of videos from Wuhan, streaming unfiltered and often heartbreaking images from the center of the outbreak. Long lines outside hospitals. Feeble patients. Agonized relatives.
The footage would have been striking anywhere. But it was especially so coming from inside China, where even mild criticism of the authorities is quickly scrubbed from the online record, and those responsible for it often punished.

The appetite for the videos reflects, in part, the shortage of independent news sources in China, where professional newspapers are tightly controlled by the authorities. Earlier this month, the state propaganda department deployed hundreds of journalists to reshape the narrative of the outbreak.

But the videos also reflected the growing call for free speech in China in recent weeks, as the coronavirus crisis has prompted criticism and introspection from unexpected corners across the country.

Several professional news organizations have produced incisive reports on the outbreak. A revolt against government censorship broke out on Chinese social media last week after the death of Li Wenliang, the Wuhan doctor who had tried to warn of the virus before officials had acknowledged an outbreak.
Mr. Fang’s and Mr. Chen’s videos were another manifestation of the dissatisfaction that the government’s handling of the outbreak has unleashed among ordinary Chinese citizens.

The Coronavirus Outbreak
What do you need to know? Start here.
Updated Feb. 10, 2020

What is a Coronavirus?
It is a novel virus named for the crown-like spikes that protrude from its surface. The coronavirus can infect both animals and people, and can cause a range of respiratory illnesses from the common cold to more dangerous conditions like Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome, or SARS.
How contagious is the virus?
According to preliminary research, it seems moderately infectious, similar to SARS, and is possibly transmitted through the air. Scientists have estimated that each infected person could spread it to somewhere between 1.5 and 3.5 people without effective containment measures.
Where has the virus spread?
The virus originated in Wuhan, China, and has sickened tens of thousands of people in China and at least two dozen other countries.
How worried should I be?
While the virus is a serious public health concern, the risk to most people outside China remains very low, and seasonal flu is a more immediate threat.
Who is working to contain the virus?
World Health Organization officials have praised China’s aggressive response to the virus by closing transportation, schools and markets. This week, a team of experts from the W.H.O. arrived in Beijing to offer assistance.
What if I’m traveling?
The United States and Australia are temporarily denying entry to noncitizens who recently traveled to China and several airlines have canceled flights.
How do I keep myself and others safe?
Washing your hands frequently is the most important thing you can do, along with staying at home when you’re sick.

“When suddenly there’s a crisis, they want to have access to a wider array of content and reporting,” said Sarah Cook, who studies Chinese media at Freedom House, a pro-democracy research group based in the United States.

The disappearance of the two men also underscores that the ruling Communist Party has no intention of loosening its grip on free speech.

China’s leader, Xi Jinping, said last month that officials needed to “strengthen the guidance of public opinion.” While Chinese social media has overflowed with fear and grief, state propaganda outlets have emphasized Mr. Xi’s steady hand, framed the fight against the outbreak as a form of patriotism and shared upbeat videos of medical workers dancing.

More than 350 people across China have been punished for “spreading rumors” about the outbreak, according to Chinese Human Rights Defenders, an advocacy group.

Mr. Chen, a fast-talking, fresh-faced lawyer from eastern China, was already well-known online before the outbreak. He traveled to Hong Kong during the pro-democracy protests last year and disputed the Chinese authorities’ depiction of the demonstrators as a riotous mob.

The Beijing authorities summoned him back to the mainland and deleted his social media accounts, Mr. Chen told his followers later.
But when the coronavirus led officials to seal off Wuhan last month, he raced to the city of 11 million, citing his duty as a self-declared citizen journalist. “What sort of a journalist are you if you don’t dare rush to the front line?” he said.

Responding to a report of a sick person in Wuhan on Jan. 22.
heard.

As time went on, Mr. Chen, usually energetic, began to show strain. “I am scared,” he said on Jan. 30. “In front of me is the virus. Behind me is China’s legal and administrative power.”

The authorities had contacted his parents to ask for his whereabouts, he said. He teared up suddenly. Then, his finger pointing at the camera, he blurted: “I’m not even scared of death. You think I’m scared of you, Communist Party?”

On Feb. 6, Mr. Chen’s friends lost contact with him. Xu Xiaodong, a prominent mixed martial arts practitioner and a friend of Mr. Chen, posted a video on Feb. 7 saying that Mr. Chen’s parents had been told that their son had been quarantined, though he had not shown symptoms of illness.
Unlike Mr. Chen, Mr. Fang, the clothing salesman, was fairly anonymous before the coronavirus outbreak. Much of his YouTube activity had involved producing enthusiastic videos about traditional Chinese clothing.

But as the outbreak escalated, he began sharing videos of Wuhan’s empty streets and crowded hospitals. They lacked the slickness of Mr. Chen’s dispatches, which were often subtitled and tightly edited. But, as with Mr. Chen’s videos, they showed a man growing increasingly desperate — and defiant.

On Feb. 2, Mr. Fang described how officials had confiscated his laptop and interrogated him about his footage of the body bags. On Feb. 4, he filmed a group of people outside his home, who said they were there to ask him questions. He turned them away, daring them to break down his door.

In his final videos, Mr. Fang turned explicitly political in a way rarely heard inside China, at least in public. Filming from inside his home — he said he was surrounded by plainclothes policemen — he railed against “greed for power” and “tyranny.”

His last video, on Feb. 9, was just 12 seconds long. It featured a scroll of paper with the words, “All citizens resist, hand power back to the people.”

Despite the worldwide audience for Mr. Fang’s and Mr. Chen’s videos, it is hard to know how much reach they had domestically, said Fang Kecheng, an assistant professor of journalism at the Chinese University of Hong Kong. Both men relied heavily on YouTube and Twitter, which are blocked in China.
But unlike the torrent of grief and anger online in response to the death of Dr. Li, news of Mr. Chen’s and Mr. Fang’s disappearances has been swiftly stamped out on Chinese social media. Their names returned almost no results on Weibo, China’s Twitter-like platform, on Friday.

Still, Ms. Cook said the power of Mr. Chen’s and Mr. Fang’s videos, as well as the reporting done by professional journalists in Wuhan, should not be underestimated.

She pointed to the Chinese authorities’ decision this week to loosen diagnostic requirements for coronavirus cases, leading to a significant jump in reported infections, as evidence of their impact.

That decision might not have come “if you didn’t have all these people in Wuhan sending out reports that what you’re hearing is an underestimate,” Ms. Cook said. “These very courageous individuals can, in unusual circumstances, push back and force the state’s hand.”

Mr. Fang, in one of his last videos, seemed struck by a similar sentiment. He thanked his viewers, who he said had been calling him nonstop to send support.

“A person, just an ordinary person, a silly person,” he said of himself, “who lifted the lid for a second.”"

It's not a coincidence that all of these people are being arrested or charged at the same time that Coronavirus is breaking out of China.

It's a possible outbreak danger, same as farms and proximity to wild animals.

>China is supposedly the world's second largest economy. But can't keep people safe, can't allow press freedom so coronavirus spread like wildfire and can't give any reliable numbers or information to the rest of the world.

Can't keep people safe? Are people getting murdered by guns in their major cities? 
Like I have repeatedly said, a VIRUS cannot be stopped once it starts. The symptoms of a virus is similar to a flu / cold. By the time , medical authorities identify irregular patterns or novel virus thru testing, it has speaded. H1N1 was identified immediately, but they couldn't stop the spread. This goes to show **it's extremely difficult to stop the spread**. You claim to have watched Netflix. You didn't watch how a researcher said all it takes is one person to spread a virus and it would spread exponentially, and they explained how many flights they have per day in the states, making the spread even faster, and then in  a matter of days, it would turn into a global pandemic. You prob left that part out cause you only believed it wouldn't happen anywhere else but China.

>Luckily the Chinese people I know aren't too stupid to separate CCP and the country.

You mean they're not too stupid to group CCP and the country. CCP is government and country is the people.

>Think what you want.... We both know that the rest of the world will blame the CCP. 

Ya everyone is gonna blame China for their slow response to a novel virus and tried to minimize the impact. Even they were opened on the problem, a virus is extremely difficult to stop."

Does the new coronavirus from China make you a little anxious? How concerned should we be? Is it a real threat or mostly hype? In today’s podcast, Dr. John Grohol, founder and editor-in-chief of PsychCentral.com, explains what the coronavirus is, how it compares to the flu and why it seems to have hit the panic button in a lot of people. He offers tips to avoid getting sick in general, and importantly, gives advice on how to keep our anxiety levels in check when it comes to new disease outbreaks, especially in how we seek information from the media.

Additionally the way they allocate lab testing resources will determine detection rates.  In their shoes I would not be clinically testing anybody in intensive care for the novel Coronavirus, but saving tests for high risk cases and their contacts where early detection can do some good.  That's probably not too far from what they're doing.

WHO data is in an intermediate stage as they work with China to accommodate modified reporting criteria. 

Likely the Hubei component of the outbreak is indeed slowing -- assuming China has not been intentionally ""cooking"" the numbers. Hopefully they are not - the WHO seems happy so far. That would give the overall plot a sigmoidal curve.  

What happens next will probably be determined by outbreak dynamics in other areas, especially areas with poor public health coverage.  There's a lot of potentially infected people who could be starting new transmission chains.  

Additionally, China is starting to lift some lockdowns because of the economic ramifications.  If things return to business as usual too soon,  infection rates may increase again. But they seem to be quite cautious still, which is a good sign.

Basically: the situation is too fluid for a simple model to capture it -- those models work for single, isolated populations (such as Wuhan) but not so well globally."

Also if I’m being honest, a majority of people in general don’t care about your downvotes. Because you can’t please everyone.

THAT BEING SAID.. I agree that the there are people on here who could use a slap in the face when it comes to the current situation.. yes “will I get sick from my package?” I’m talking to you guys.

They posted the topic and asking how it happened is relevant to the topic.

>Everybody here could end up in a worse financial position given enough time, we are in a time where people are still saying invest in the stock market/housing and something like the coronavirus could change things worldwide, even drought/climate change could ruin Australia's housing market, how would you avoid that? Lower natural growth and less immigration could do the same, Op's mum would have seen deposit rates ten times what they are now and could have planned for them to stay high, there aren't many people in the world who would have expected interest rates to be where they are or for this long, now and in the future.

Asking how is still a good question.

>Even if it was a poor investment are you saying people could avoid those and if that's possible why aren't they avoiding them now?

It could've been because they were addicted to the pokies for their entire life and that would be relevant wouldn't it?

It is important to know *how* this happened, literally any financial planner would ask you that same question.

Maybe they're bad with money (invest in whoever cold calls them) and should have a more hands off approach with how they deal with this money."

You factor in this lower sulphur fuel used in the shipping industry decreasing global dimming, and the coronavirus explosion due to mismanagement also slowing down production.

Throwaway in case my coworkers stumble upon this. 

I (22F) work as a server at a restaurant. Yesterday, I had a table of two middle-aged men. From the start they were clearly trying to be funny and sarcastic - for instance, when I poured them water out of a glass jug they were like ""ooh, fancy."" I overheard them talking about military stuff and one guy mentioned being deployed abroad.

They sort of bantered with each other right in front of me while I was waiting to take their order, and one guy said something like ""ha, stay away from me, I have a pretty bad cold!"" The other guy joked around and then the sick guy was like ""I actually just got back from China and I'm not feeling well!"" They looked at me waiting for me to laugh and join in, but I just stood a couple feet away and didn't really laugh. 

I have a blood disorder that's caused me to have a severely compromised immune system, so I have to be really careful about getting sick and I don't really find strangers joking about having a deadly disease to be funny.  I did my job, took their orders, brought them food, refilled their drinks for the rest of the night, but I didn't go out of my way to be friendly to them. I think I seemed uncomfortable near them the whole night, because a paranoid part of my brain was scared that the guy really did come back from China since they were talking about being deployed in other countries.

I was honestly pissed off that they joked about something so serious to me. I feel like they wouldn't have joked about having the coronavirus to someone they didn't view as ""beneath"" them or easy to mess with. I understand wanting to banter with service workers, but I'm not comfortable laughing at the idea of this man giving me a disease that would instantly kill me.

When they were getting ready to leave, the guy said something like ""you know I don't actually have the coronavirus right? We're joking."" I just responded ""It's hard to tell if you're joking. Have a good night."" I knew they were joking but I wanted to make them aware of how inappropriate it was. They tipped a normal amount and nothing else happened. Was I an asshole to take it so seriously and let it affect the service I gave them?

TLDR; I work as a server and two ""funny"" customers joked that one of them is sick and just got back from China. I was pissed that they joked about this and was cold and uncomfortable interacting with them the whole night.

Back then ""national emergency"" was skeptical because it expanded powers of surveillance on citizens in addition to others.

Now it's about a potential virus that's coming from outside, and preventing carriers from entering. expanding powers to keep people out has been big on the right for quite some time.

It also hinges on how you define ""elites."" I have more trust in the CDC than I do the ""professional managerial class"" as the popular term seems to be now, and I trust the CDC to make good suggestions. Being the literal government, the CDC is in some sense elite, right? But the PMC is a different, cultural ""elite"" that I expect to oppose those suggestions for ridiculous reasons (quarantines are racist, etc)."

Há pelo menos paralelismos entre o primeiro e o segundo ano da “nova era”.

 1) [O crescimento da economia na virada do ano foi frustrante](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/mercado/2020/02/setor-de-servicos-cai-04-em-dezembro-diz-ibge.shtml), pelos dados conhecidos até agora, oficiais. [Indústria](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/mercado/2020/02/apos-dois-anos-em-alta-industria-recua-11-em-2019.shtml) e [comércio](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/mercado/2020/02/varejo-cai-001-em-dezembro-e-contraria-estimativas-de-crescimento-de-vendas-de-natal.shtml) cresceram menos em 2019 do que em 2018; serviços, um tico mais. O[ investimento em máquinas](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/colunas/viniciustorres/2020/02/brasil-investe-menos-e-bolsonaro-brinca-de-carrinho-sem-gasolina.shtml), instalações produtivas e residências foi menor, pela estimativa do Ipea.

 2) O governo cria crises políticas e de imagem gratuitas e grotescas, atirando no próprio pé, tentando mirar na própria cabecinha.

 3) Embora o “parlamentarismo branco”, a nova preponderância do Congresso, tenda a permanecer, mudanças ministeriais, a [militarização do Planalto](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/poder/2020/02/bolsonaro-anuncia-onyx-na-cidadania-e-general-braga-netto-na-casa-civil.shtml), incompetências políticas e outras barbaridades do governismo vão exigir algum rearranjo da relação com o Parlamento.

 4) A demagogia de[ Jair ](https://www.google.com/search?q=jair+bolsonaro+folha+topicos&rlz=1C1GCEU_pt-BR&oq=jair+bolsonaro&aqs=chrome.1.69i57j35i39j0l5j69i65.2895j0j7&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8)[Bolsonaro](https://www.google.com/search?q=jair+bolsonaro+folha+topicos&rlz=1C1GCEU_pt-BR&oq=jair+bolsonaro&aqs=chrome.1.69i57j35i39j0l5j69i65.2895j0j7&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8) levanta outra vez a suspeita, ainda que risco ora remoto, de que o presidente avacalhe de vez a dita “agenda de reformas”, o programa da elite econômica.

  Como se sabe, Bolsonaro causou confusão ao tratar de[ impostos sobre ](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/mercado/2020/02/bolsonaro-desafia-governadores-e-diz-que-corta-impostos-sobre-combustiveis-se-estados-zerarem-icms.shtml)[combustíveis](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/mercado/2020/02/bolsonaro-desafia-governadores-e-diz-que-corta-impostos-sobre-combustiveis-se-estados-zerarem-icms.shtml) ou de [dólar](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/mercado/2020/02/apos-sinalizar-desistencia-bolsonaro-promete-reforma-administrativa-para-a-proxima-semana.shtml), além de fraquejar com a [reforma administrativa](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/mercado/2020/02/governo-avalia-desistir-de-pec-da-reforma-administrativa.shtml).

 5) O governo parece uma balbúrdia mesmo em assuntos cruciais, de interesse do “bloco de poder”. Bolsonaro, numa contradança com [Paulo Guedes](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/ilustrissima/2020/02/ate-quando-chicagadas-de-guedes-vao-ser-argumento-para-conformismo.shtml), cria confusão sobre a [reforma tributária](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/mercado/2020/02/guedes-propoe-compensar-estados-que-tiverem-perdas-com-reforma-tributaria.shtml). Em parte, o governo não sabe o que quer; em parte, ideias de Guedes têm sido vetadas em público pelo presidente ([CPMF](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/mercado/2019/12/bolsonaro-defende-reforma-tributaria-possivel-e-descarta-cpmf.shtml), “[imposto do pecado](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/mercado/2020/01/bolsonaro-contraria-guedes-e-nega-possibilidade-de-imposto-do-pecado.shtml)”).

 As perspectivas, no entanto, pelo menos até agora, são certamente melhores do que as de 2019, ao menos no que diz respeito à retomada da economia (para quem considera “retomada” um crescimento de uns 2% neste ano).

 Ainda assim, o investimento continua catatônico e o governo não consegue colocar na rua um programa de concessões para a iniciativa privada ou medidas que removam o entulho burocrático da economia. Vai tudo ficando para 2021.

 Os dados de indústria, comércio e serviço foram frustrantes, mas não há cheiro de queimado ou chabu. Além do mais, os dados publicados até agora não cobrem toda a produção que acaba aparecendo na medida do PIB. Pode haver surpresa (até surpresa ruim, claro).

 O regime acidental do “parlamentarismo branco’’, que inexistia até março de 2019, tende a durar pelo menos até o final do ano, o que deve permitir a aprovação de alguma reforma, como a do arrochão dos gastos ([PEC Emergencial](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/colunas/antoniodelfim/2020/02/a-pec-emergencial.shtml)), sem o que o [teto de gastos ](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/mercado/2016/12/1841666-pec-do-teto-e-promulgada-no-congresso-em-plenario-quase-vazio.shtml)vai ser furado em 2021. No entanto, o Congresso está meio farto de Bolsonaro.

 Com o começo do ano legislativo e protestos dos donos do dinheiro grosso, é possível que Bolsonaro se controle ao menos no que diz respeito a esses interesses econômicos maiores.

 Ou seja, delegaria a condução da economia para o premiê acidental[ Rodrigo Maia](https://m.folha.uol.com.br/folha-topicos/rodrigo-maia/?pg=4) e seu ministro Paulo Guedes, dedicando-se como de costume à sua preocupação maior, o desvario ideológico e ultrajes autoritários.

 Enfim, em vez da [guerra econômica ](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/mercado/2020/02/china-cortara-tarifas-pela-metade-sobre-algumas-importacoes-dos-eua.shtml)[sino-americana](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/mercado/2020/02/china-cortara-tarifas-pela-metade-sobre-algumas-importacoes-dos-eua.shtml), neste ano temos o risco ainda sem medida do novo [coronavírus](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/equilibrioesaude/2020/02/com-nova-metodologia-numero-de-mortes-por-coronavirus-chega-a-242-em-um-dia-e-registro-de-casos-triplica.shtml), que vai morder algum crescimento no Brasil.

 Em resumo, apesar das perspectivas melhores, o governo recria ou alimenta riscos velhos, engaja-se no desvario e não define prioridades racionais.

 Com a economia frágil e a possibilidade normal de choques, por definição fora do nosso controle, conclui-se que o governo está dando muita chance para o azar. 

 Bolsonaro se importa?"

Presumably /u/psychosil444 does not already have food etc. reserves or he wouldn't be seeking such desperate options.

/u/Melmel20 has it right, now is a time to network.  I add, get yourself into a proper prepping mindset, including discarding any thoughts about getting something for nothing; here, hoping the financial system completely disappears to cover your overdrafts, which would be a much worse disaster unless one gets killed by the virus.  

Nothing good comes from an attitude of cheating, we're seeing that today because the Chinese Communist Party (CCP), probably at the Wuhan city and Hubei province level, tried back in December to create a reality where they weren't really having a SARS like outbreak, despite isolating and sequencing a novel coronavirus on December 24th based on their already observing viral pneumonia of unknown origin cases (and it took them 17 days to publish it in the West).  Turns out ""you can't fool Mother Nature.""

If /u/psychosil444 can't find anyone to network with and prep together, well, work on that.  If it's because he's not trustworthy as his posting suggests, work on *that*.  ""Find religion"", in whatever sense that makes.  You're going to need it if this turns into a catastrophe."
