During the House Oversight Committee discussion on the novel coronavirus response, the director of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said some deaths from coronavirus have been discovered posthumously.  

Rep. Harley Rouda asked CDC director Dr. Robert Redfield if it’s possible that some flu patients may have been misdiagnosed and actually had coronavirus.

""The standard practice is the first thing you do is test for influenza, so if they had influenza they would be positive,"" Redfield said.

Rouda then asked Redfield if they are doing posthumous testing.

Redfield said there has been ""a surveillance system of deaths from pneumonia, that the CDC has; it’s not in every city, every state, every hospital.”

Rouda followed up and asked, “So we could have some people in the United States dying for what appears to be influenza when in fact it could be the coronavirus?”

The doctor replied that “some cases have actually been diagnosed that way in the United States today.”"

A separate note: fuck the CCP for virtually creating this pandemic by jailing whistleblowers and doctors, suppressing information, faking and modifying stats, failing to work with international organizations, etc.

This is their Chernobyl moment....they blew it.

**Edit:** sources because the responses to me are trash:

1) Yes, WHO is brown-nosing to China. For example, WHO [prevented Taiwan from attending meetings](https://foreignpolicy.com/2020/01/22/china-health-coronavirus-wuhan-virus-spreads-taiwan-no-say-who/) on the Wuhan virus. Clearly, they're saying nice things so that China doesn't do to them what it does to [foreign journalists who don't brown-nose](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-china-51558310) - kick them out. This is why they continue to praise China's response [despite criticism even from Chinese officials](https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/world/chinese-officials-note-serious-problems-in-coronavirus-response-the-world-health-organization-keeps-praising-them/ar-BBZMSUz?ocid=st2) - and pretty obvious evidence that China bungled this with its lies and coverups. Anybody who doesn't toe that party line - yes, that would include WHO - is in trouble. That's exactly why this is China's Chernobyl.

2) China covered up the Wuhan virus until it was already in full swing. Chinese authorities [delayed reporting the outbreak](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/01/world/asia/china-coronavirus.html?action=click&module=Top%20Stories&pgtype=Homepage) and then [downplayed and covered up what they knew,](https://www.vox.com/2020/1/27/21082354/coronavirus-outbreak-wuhan-china-early-on-lancet) and [muzzled a doctor](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-china-51364382) (and then [*jailed* 8 other doctors)](https://www.thedailybeast.com/china-arrested-doctors-who-warned-about-coronavirus-outbreak-now-death-tolls-rising-stocks-are-plunging) who was trying to warn colleagues about the virus.

**A Botnet Is Taken Down in an Operation by Microsoft, Not the Government**

>By David E. Sanger

>March 10, 2020

>WASHINGTON — Microsoft organized 35 nations on Tuesday to take down one of the world’s largest botnets — malware that secretly seizes control of millions of computers around the globe. It was an unusual disruption of an internet criminal group, because it was carried out by a company, not a government.

>The action, eight years in the making, was aimed at a criminal group called Necurs, believed to be based in Russia. Microsoft employees had long tracked the group as it infected nine million computers around the world, hijacking them to send spam emails intended to defraud unsuspecting victims. The group also mounted stock market scams and spread ransomware, which locks up a computer until the owner pays a fee.

>Over the past year, Microsoft’s Digital Crimes Unit has been quietly lining up support from legal authorities in countries around the world, convincing them that the group had seized computers in their territories to conduct future attacks.

>“It’s a highway out there that is used only by criminals,” Amy Hogan-Burney, the general manager of the Digital Crimes Unit and a former F.B.I. lawyer, said on Tuesday. “And the idea that we would allow those to keep existing makes no sense. We have to dismantle the infrastructure.”

>The team struck on Tuesday, from an eerily empty Microsoft campus. Tens of thousands of workers had been ordered to stay home because the area near the headquarters in Redmond, Wash., has been a hot spot for the coronavirus. But taking down a botnet, the company concluded, was not a work-from-home task.

>After cleansing the Digital Crimes Unit’s command center to eliminate any live viruses, a small team of Microsoft workers gathered in a conference room at 7 a.m., flipped on their laptops and began coordinating action against another kind of global infection.

>As soon as a federal court order against the Necurs network was unsealed, they began prearranged calls with authorities and network providers around the world to strike Necurs at once, cutting off its connections to computers around the globe.

>“Was Mongolia hit? I think it was in the court order,” one Microsoft employee asked. There was debate about Somalia — “a very last-minute win,” another noted. “Tajikistan?” one person in the room asked, looking for it to turn green on a map overhead, indicating that the botnet had been neutralized there. “No joy yet.”

>Rapidly, they took over or froze six million domain names that Necurs was using or had inventoried for future attacks. A domain name can be a website — www.nytimes.com is a legitimate one, for example — but Necurs had created an algorithm to spawn millions of new domains, often with deceptive names, for future use against unsuspecting victims. Microsoft engineers had cracked the code.

>Domain names are sold around the world, a profitable business, but Ms. Hogan-Burney said she had no illusions that the group would be permanently disabled. “We’ve cut off their arms, for a while,” she said.

>Necurs is not believed to be a state-sponsored Russian group. But intelligence officials say it is tolerated by the Russian state, and on regular occasions the Kremlin’s intelligence services use private actors to pursue their goals. The Internet Research Agency, which mounted the social media disinformation campaign on Facebook and other platforms during the 2016 American president election, was a private group, though founded by a close friend of President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia.

>By Tuesday’s end, there was satisfaction that, for the 18th time in 10 years, Microsoft had taken down a digital criminal operation. But it was unclear whether anyone would be indicted, or even if indicted, whether they would ever face a trial.

>Microsoft executives acknowledged that this was a game of whack-a-mole, and that the creators of Necurs and groups like it would be back.

>“The cybercriminals are incredibly agile,” said Tom Burt, the executive who leads Microsoft’s security and trust operations, “and they come back more sophisticated, more complex. It is an ultimate cat-and-mouse game.”

>The next battlefield, he said, would be the 2020 presidential election.

>“We expect the volume and sophistication of the adversary attacks to accelerate as we get closer to Election Day,” he said.

>“They will play many of the same moves they used in 2016,” Mr. Burt said. “But they will use others as well,” including the possibility of ransomware that locks up local voter registration systems, a major fear of election officials across the United States.

>“The trick this time is to be ready, agile and aware that we have to be one step ahead,” he said."

There is a lake, upon which is a single lily pad. This lily pad reproduces every day, so that after one day, there will be two lily pads. After 48 days, the lake will be completely covered with lily pads.

1. How many days does it take for the lake to be half full? 

2. How many days does it take for the lake to be over 1% full? 

The answer to question 1 is surprising, but fairly obvious, if you think about it for a moment: 47 days.

The answer to question 2 is even more shocking: the lake only crosses 1% on day 42.

It takes six weeks to get to 1%. It takes under one week to fill the other 99%."

Trump 2/24: “The Coronavirus is very much under control in the USA. We are in contact with everyone and all relevant countries. CDC & World Health have been working hard and very smart. Stock Market starting to look very good to me!”

Trump 2/26: I don’t think it’s going to come to that, especially with the fact that we’re going down, not up. We’re going very substantially down, not up. But, yeah, I think schools should be preparing and, you know, get ready just in case.” He added: “We have it so well under control. I mean, we really have done a very good job.”

Trump 3/2: “We had a great meeting today with a lot of the great companies, and they’re going to have vaccines, I think, relatively soon. And they’re going to have something that makes you better, and that’s going to actually take place we think even sooner.”

Also Trump .3/2: “The United States is right now ranked by far No. 1 in the world for preparedness.”

Trump 3/4: “Well, I think the 3.4 percent is really a false number. Now, this is just my hunch, and — but based on a lot of conversations with a lot of people that do this, because a lot of people will have this, and it’s very mild. … So, if we have thousands or hundreds of thousands of people that get better just by, you know, sitting around and even going to work — some of them go to work, but they get better.”

Trump Two days ago: The Fake News Media and their partner, the Democrat Party, is doing everything within its semi-considerable power (it used to be greater!) to inflame the CoronaVirus situation, far beyond what the facts would warrant. Surgeon General, “The risk is low to the average American.”

Also Trump Two Days Ago: So last year 37,000 Americans died from the common Flu. It averages between 27,000 and 70,000 per year. Nothing is shut down, life & the economy go on. At this moment there are 546 confirmed cases of CoronaVirus, with 22 deaths. Think about that!

Trump Yesterday: Going up fast. We need the Wall more than ever!

Trump today: The Media should view this as a time of unity and strength. We have a common enemy, actually, an enemy of the World, the CoronaVirus. We must beat it as quickly and safely as possible. There is nothing more important to me than the life & safety of the United States!

Trump Now:  On January 31, 2020, I issued Proclamation 9984 (Suspension of Entry as Immigrants and Nonimmigrants of Persons Who Pose a Risk of Transmitting 2019 Novel Coronavirus and Other Appropriate Measures To Address This Risk).  I found that the potential for widespread transmission of a novel (new) coronavirus (which has since been renamed “SARS-CoV-2” and causes the disease COVID-19) (“SARS-CoV-2” or “the virus”) by infected individuals seeking to enter the United States threatens the security of our transportation system and infrastructure and the national security. "

* Coronavirus is most contagious via airborne transmission. Washing your hands helps but does not eliminate your chances of catching the illness.

* The overwhelming majority people who contract coronavirus survive but that's not really the issue. There is currently no vaccine and since the illness is highly contagious that means there is a realistic chance that a significant amount of at-risk individuals (the elderly and people with illnesses) will contract the virus and then overwhelm the healthcare system in a very short period of time.

The risk goes beyond straight mortality: in China, the WHO found that *20%* of victims needed hospitalization.

It’s a trite but true saying most often applied to comparisons drawn from the distant past.

>Today we have a choice. We can learn from the recent past – from the experience of Wuhan, China’s fight against the coronavirus – or we can repeat the distant past, ending up with a pandemic reminiscent of the 1918 Spanish flu.

>Though Wuhan has had the most cases of the coronavirus so far, if we continue much further along our national path of purposeful unpreparedness, specious comparisons, politicking ,
hesitation and ineptitude in our response to the pandemic, only our most lucky cities will be comparable to Wuhan. Learning from Wuhan’s
recent past – and rapidly acting on those lessons – is the only way we can prevent our nation from driving itself into a historic catastrophe.

>In a city of nearly 11 million, Wuhan’s approximately 67,000 cases amount to just 0.6% of its population. And despite the difficulty of obtaining accurate data amid the crisis, the World Health Organization (WHO) ground reports verify the numbers coming out of the city as credible. Given the (relatively high) estimated rates of transmissibility of this virus, how did Chinese officials in Wuhan keep it from spreading more rapidly?
Wuhan’s initial approach to the virus was to deny its existence, downplay its severity, and delay action. That errant approach is arguably responsible for the early-stage massive growth in infections caused by the new virus, infections that quickly overwhelmed the highly modern hospital system in the city.

>According to a top WHO official returning from Wuhan, the coronavirus is the “ Wayne Gretzky of viruses”. Initially the virus is unassuming and seems unthreatening – spreading to others even before symptoms appear – yet it’s ruthlessly effective, as it can cause a slow, prolonged death, maximizing its spread.

>As soon as it was clear that the virus was swamping healthcare in Wuhan and threatening to engulf China more broadly, the Chinese government implemented radical social distancing measures, coupled with abundant free testing, attempting to slow the virus’s spread.

>Yet, even these social distancing measures – stopping outbound transportation, stalling public transit and driving, implementing mandatory mask-wearing, cancelling social gatherings, and requiring home quarantines – proved insufficient to halt the expansion of the virus.

>Then, on 1 February, Wuhan switched to centralized quarantine, a decision that research has shown was essential in containing the spread of the virus to such a small portion of the city’s population. By delaying the implementation of the more radical measures, Wuhan let their problem metastasize. Their governmental hesitation produced more deaths.

>Still, it could have been much, much worse. Chinese officials saved tens of thousands of lives by acting as decisively as they did, when they did. And the city’s path to containment has provided invaluable information and time for the rest of the world to get ahead of the virus.

>In the US, we’re following Wuhan’s initial strategy of deny, downplay and delay without substantial indication that we’ll be willing to take the radical measures necessary to slow the spread of the virus. US officials are employing part of the Chinese playbook: the bad part. Unfortunately, this strategy is putting us solidly on course for a replay of the 1918 Spanish flu pandemic.

>While we’re probably past containment, we can still mitigate. Each day of inaction increases the probability our healthcare systems become overwhelmed by the long-lasting sickness. If we don’t act now, we’ll soon be asking: whose life is worth more? With the majority of the nation at risk, we have no time to waste.

>Now isn’t the time for piecemeal efforts and calm, counterproductive comparisons . Now is the time for unified dramatic social, civic and governmental action – including immediate and mandatory social distancing in all areas with demonstrated community spread coupled with mass-scale quarantines. It’s time to follow the good part of the Wuhan playbook.

>China used the analogy to war to mobilize its people’s response to the virus. It’s apt. The cost of further avoidance will be measured in the
hundreds of thousands of ugly deaths of our loved ones.

>Very few of us were alive to see the devastation of 1918, and we can only imagine the horrors of what could have happened had Wuhan not acted as they did. As we both watched this crisis start to unfold months ago, we worried that we might be on course for many of US cities to be as bad as Wuhan. Today we realize: we would be lucky to be Wuhan."

My father-in-law is an infectious diseases doctor and my sister is an epidemiologist. I talked to them both recently and they reinforced to me that if you're a young and healthy person, the threat of this virus to you and your health is likely minimal. You may get it and not even know that you have it, or you may develop flu-like symptoms.

For many of you who fall into that young/healthy category, the real reason to self-quarantine and maintain ""social distance"" is not to keep yourself healthy- rather, it is to reduce the spread of the disease to vulnerable populations. It's already gone ""viral,"" but the more people who are infected without taking isolation measures, the faster and further the disease spreads- and possibly to vulnerable populations like those who are elderly or have compromised immune systems.

If we all take collective action together, we can have a real impact in slowing the spread of the disease, giving healthcare systems a chance to catch-up and/or avoid situations where they become inundated with an unmanageable number of cases at once. If the latter happens, this will lead to deaths which could have been preventable.

So please do the socially responsible thing and stay at home for a while if you can. And if you have to go out, practice excellent hygiene to be courteous to those populations who may be at greater risk than you are.

We'll eventually get through this, and so will the economy. Yes, financial markets are selling off, but in the case of equities, they were already very overvalued. It was just a matter of when, not ""if."" This situation was likely just a catalyst for that event, though it is creating unique types of panic we might not otherwise see under such circumstances.

Keep a level head if you can, and take care of yourselves and each other, fam."

First of all, the market loves Trump. I’m not saying the market *should* love Trump or that he did anything to deserve it, but the market shot up when he won the election, and we’ve been riding that wave until just recently when the coronavirus went global. You’ll find very few serious investors who aren’t planning to vote for him, if only reluctantly because they don’t want to rock this boat.

The other factor is that the market hates uncertainty. That’s partly why it’s crashing right now: nobody knows how big this virus will get, nobody knows what long term effects it will have on industry, and that scares investors. When investors get scared, they sell, and when people sell en masse, the market collapses. Loss of one of the biggest world powers’ leaders is rife with uncertainty."

My Fellow Americans. Today America faces an unprecedented challenge. I am asking every single one of you to help one another in the difficult days that lie ahead.

Our democracy, our economy, the health of our citizens will be tested as never before. When the last pandemic hit America in 1918, during the First World War, mistakes were made. The leaders of cities and states failed to take drastic, immediate actions that could have slowed the spread of a very deadly influenza.  As a result there were a whole lot of unnecessary deaths.

The Coronavirus is no influenza. It's far worse. More infectious, and far more lethal. Something none of us have any immunity for, and for which a vaccine is a long ways away. The biggest risk we face is our hospitals getting totally overwhelmed by very sick people. To reduce how badly our hospitals are oversubscribed we absolutely must ""flatten the curve."" That is to say we MUST, we have NO CHOICE but to slow the spread of this illness by every means possible.

That includes quarantines, social distancing, the shutting down of schools and businesses alike. Air travel and Mass transit, except for, for example, healthcare workers who absolutely MUST get to their jobs. We've got to do EVERYTHING we can, not just a few things.  In short, we are going to have to SHUT IT ALL DOWN, at least for a while.

It is my job not just to save lives by slowing the virus, but to do everything I can to prevent our economy from tanking, as most people in America must work in order to eat. Many of you live paycheck to paycheck.  We're not all billionaires. I get it!  We simply cannot make half of our population homeless AND put you out of work. But allowing the virus to spread rapidly will have the same effect, only worse, if we do not contain it, or at least slow it down as much as humanly possible. It's a pay me now, or pay me more later situation.

A big part of my job in the coming weeks and months is to prevent panic. Panic won't help our communities, our nation, or our neighbors. Some of you have prepared for this and bought extra food. Many of you have not. **There is plenty of food in America PROVIDED everyone doesn't panic and suddenly buy far more than they need.** Most of us have shelves with canned goods we can survive on for a while. We are going to have to SHARE food with those who don't have any. We are going to have to trust that this is going to work out, that we ourselves will not run short if we help others. We are going to have to have faith. Not televangelist, send-me-money faith, but true faith in the power of good within each of us.

America, we are going to have to put each other first, and money a distant second to get as many of us through this as possible. I don't have all the answers. We may have to suspend mortgages, student loans, rents, all sorts of things to prevent bankrupting so many people that this results an a 1929 style depression. That's the very last thing we need on top of a pandemic.

We may have to put large #'s of Americans whose jobs suddenly disappear on some sort of ""Coronavirus Income Supplement""  until this crisis is over.  I'm sure my critics will criticize it as ""Welfare"" and honestly I don't give a crap.  I will not allow Americans to starve for lack of money with which to buy food because a never-before seen virus destroyed their ability to earn a living.  That would only lead to food riots and looting with far worse consequences than what such assistance might do to the budget.

We are all going to have to work together. We, your public servants, are going to make mistakes, like our failure in the testing for this virus that ALREADY has let it get unconstrained in some areas. We promise to correct our mistakes as fast as possible and move forward. We are going to give the American public the truth and nothing but the truth about outbreaks, deaths, and the problems we face. No fudging the numbers! And we, your public servants, are going to listen to you, the American public, via sites like [Change.org](https://change.org/) and [Petition.org](https://petition.org/) on how we might do things better.

Our nation has never faced an enemy like this before. An enemy that attacks from within. Our political bickering must come to an end today. It doesn't matter if you are a Republican or A Democrat a Conservative or a Liberal or even a Bernie Sanders-style socialist! . We are all Americans and unless we ALL pull together we risk losing everything, our democracy, our health, our well being, all of it. We simply cannot go on sniping at one another or playing the blame game. Everyone must pull together.

We need solutions, not blame. Cooperation, not competition. Capitalism alone isn't going to save us. For starters we are going to have to provide ALL Americans with ALL the healthcare they need, at no further out-of-pocket expense. Healthcare that comes out of your taxes instead of an ever bigger defense budget. I am indeed talking about government provided, socialized healthcare. Because our enemy today doesn't sail a battleships. Our enemy is a 120 micron virus particle. And the vast majority of us can't afford all the healthcare many of us are going to need. I refuse to see one more american go Bankrupt trying to pay hospital bills!

Things were much different in 1918. Most food was grown within 10 miles of where it was consumed. **Today we depend on trains, trucks, airplanes, and the Internet to make sure everything, including toilet paper, gets to where it needs to be, JUST IN TIME. But that puts us at even greater risk if hoarding and panic buying occurs. I'm asking you right now to STOP IT. Buy what you need and not more!** America's toilet paper factories haven't gone out of business! There's plenty if 10% of Americans don't put 50 rolls in their closets.

*Friends, I need you to ""Share a square"" with your neighbors if you have hoarded TP, and they run short. Its the right thing to do! And yes, I promise we'll give Americans who install a bidet a tax credit provided Mitch McConnell & company don't stymie me!  \*wink\**

A lot of you suffered from very bad flu's this past year. It turns out SOME of those were in fact the Coronavirus. It has been circulating in our country longer than we thought. To the point where it is in fact endemic in some areas. That means only DRASTIC measures, like EVERYONE who possibly can staying home. Avoiding social contact. Wearing a mask in public if you can get one.

No, we will not be welding Americans in their homes, but we may indeed impose quarantines and insist people in certain areas STAY there until the threat has passed; until an incubation period has expired. You will need to self-organize in your neighborhoods and send ONE person out for food & meds, not every single one of you.  If the Chinese can organize and do it, we can do it better! 

I know many medications are going to be in short supply because MOST come from China.  Medicines you depend on to stay alive. Believe me.  We are working on it.  During World War II American industry ramped up and got the job done.  We can do it again, whether it's insulin or other medicines, non-perishable foods, and even, yes, toilet paper.This is gonna be a painful and expensive way to bring certain industries, like pharmaceuticals, back to America, but we don't have any other choice.  And it will create new jjobs.

The microbiologists and virologists and scientists in this country are hard at work on vaccines and treatments.  I assure you the Federal Government will take down eVERY roadbloack in their way towards a cure.  If they need money for R&D, we will supply it. It may cost as much as the Manhattan project did during WW2 and in the end it will be worth every penny by shortening our war against the Coronavirus.  This is indeed ALL HANDS ON DECK.  And young people, I want some of YOU to consider becoming Microbiologists.  We're going to need every one of you!

I will need you, MY FELLOW Americans, to feed and take care of the Doctors and Nurses who are going to be on the front lines of this. Many of you are going to end up on the front lines, from First Responders to Tow truck drivers. Because all of the things that normally send people to the hospital aren't going to magically stop because we ALSO have to treat Coronavirus patients.

Tough times are ahead for us. Very tough times, and to be totally honest a lot of Americans are going to die. Not just the elderly, although they're at special risk. Many of you are going to get very sick with pneumonia. The only possible way we can, as a nation, survive this, is if we all work together. Do those things that are not just best for ourselves, but for our neighbors. If this were to devolve into ""Every man or woman for herself"" we will have lost the battle, the very things that make this nation great.

I will speak to you again tomorrow night, and every night until this is over. I want you to remain calm, but start doing whatever you can to prepare for what is ahead. Study and learn how to avoid contracting this virus. For gods sake wash your hands. Stay away from crowds. And have faith. We are the greatest nation on earth, and that is because we have the greatest people in the world. In every crisis there are bad actors, and those helpers who show what incredibly great people Americans really are. I, our country is going to need every single one of you in that second group.

Good night, and God Bless you."

This virus is severe, i am shocked to see that countries are not acting to prevent what happened to Italy. And let's speak frankly... Italy didn't have more cases, the trend is the same for every country. What in italy is going on now, it will happen to the UK, US, France, Spain, Germany in the next 2 weeks. The biggest difference, is that Italy did a ton of tests on people, even the ones with just a simple flu got tested and many found out that way that they had the coronavirus, so they had a chance to do some prevention instead of waiting to be really badly sick.

But paradoxically, those countries are doing nothing to prevent it. They like to wait for the catastrophe.

This virus is also not just like a flu. It killed in Italy 40% of people so far who reached the end of the illness. 12K are actually infected, but nobody knows yet how they progress, around 1000 recovered,  800 died. So it's 60%-40%.

This virus is not a joke, and it's not true that it kills only old people. 30-40% of critical people are under 50 as some doctor told. So if it find a good place to grow, it may kill anybody.

It's just a joke that many countries are still ignoring it. It's unbelievable.

Some of the patients received antiviral medications but the drugs did not appear to shorten the virus's lifespan.
The 19 doctors who authored the study analyzed the medical records of 191 patients in China (135 from Jinyintan Hospital and 56 from Wuhan Pulmonary Hospital), including the demographic, clinical, treatment and laboratory data of 137 coronavirus patients who were discharged and 54 patients who died in the hospital. 

They found that the virus was present in the bodies of patients with severe disease status for an average of 19 days, and inside the bodies of patients with critical disease status for an average of 24 days. Overall, the virus was detected for an average of 20 days in patients who were eventually discharged from the hospital. In the respiratory tracts of patients who died, coronavirus was detectable until death.

The shortest length of time the virus lived in the respiratory tract of a survivor was eight days. And perhaps most shocking of all, in some cases, the virus persisted for as long as 37 days. 
""This has important implications for both patient isolation decision making and guidance around the length of antiviral treatment,"" the authors of the study concluded.
For weeks, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has been advising Americans who traveled to one of the virus's epicenters or who may have been otherwise exposed to self-quarantine for 14 days. Does this study suggest the risk could persist longer? Well, not necessarily.
CBS News medical contributor Dr. David Agus says using this study's findings to extrapolate how long a person might be contagious is probably taking it a step too far.
""This is an important study to understand the medical course of patients who have symptomatic cases of Covid-19 infection,"" he said in an email. ""I would be very cautious to use these data to quantify periods of being infectious. This information has yet to be determined definitively."""

Just be more conscious and, if you really need to swatch something, make sure you wash your hands **thoroughly** after coming into contact with things like testers on your hands. One swipe of micellar water won't be enough.  I'd avoid using testers anywhere on your face for now, tbh.

>DIAMOND: I think they are both trying to show that they're incredibly active and aggressive in public, but some of the decisions behind the scenes haven't always reflected the best judgment of career professionals. In the case of Alex Azar, he did go to the president in January. He did push past resistance from the president's political aides to warn the president the new coronavirus could be a major problem. There were aides around Trump - Kellyanne Conway had some skepticism at times that this was something that needed to be a presidential priority.

>But at the same time, Secretary Azar has not always given the president the worst-case scenario of what could happen. **My understanding is he did not push to do aggressive additional testing in recent weeks, and that's partly because more testing might have led to more cases being discovered of coronavirus outbreak, and the president had made clear - the lower the numbers on coronavirus, the better for the president, the better for his potential reelection this fall.**"

If things continue the way they have, you are going to see 200 million, if not 250 million cases in the US. Our government at the federal level, regardless of political affiliation, has botched this to an unbelievable degree. Our country is at least 4 days behind in it's response, and tonights speech by Trump is the most egregious of them. These things should have been said and done day one, period.

For those of you reading this, I am not a doomsday guy. I don't think this is the end of the world, but our lives are going to drastically change over the coming months, especially for those of you in large cities. which are going to experience the worst of this. The CDC has fucked over HCWs by not preparing for this. Preparations should have been done a decade ago, but weren't.

The market bubbles were allowed to inflate to a ridiculous degree with few if any checks, if not outright encouragement. Now the coronavirus has shown that a global economy carries with it these risks, and those bubbles are popping.

We have relied far too much on other nations. We can not even scrounge up the resources to handle this pandemic, and even if we could we do not have the time. The time for mitigation has passed. We have no method of containment, our leaders have lied to us time and time again.

The people who were supposed to be ""for the people by the people"" have prioritized their political agendas, and wallets over human life, but if it is any consolation, it is an almost certainty that they have been exposed, and if Iran or Italy are anything to go by then expect to see something similar soon.

I wish everyone reading this the best of luck, and hope that you prepared, as I plan on staying at home and watching what is to come with a mix of curiosity, caution, and most likely rage."

Potentially thousands. 1-2 weeks ago, Italy had a similar number of cases to what we have in Australia. They closed schools and many workplaces, and cancelled large events, back *then* and this likely helped reduced cases drastically (friends of mine in Italy have kids on week 3 of virtual schooling and haven't been able to go into work in at least a week). Yet it *still* hasn't been enough to prevent ICUs being overwhelmed, and hospitals in large cities such as Milan having to refuse ventilators to those over 60. 

Hospitals are so overrun, doctors are having to decide in the ED who lives or dies, because there aren't enough beds, enough ventilators, enough doctors - and in Italy an unexpectedly high number of people under 40 are becoming critically ill and needing high level support. It's not just the very old. It's not ""like a bad flu"". And Italy is an advanced economy with a very good health care system. Imagine where they'd be if they hadn't taken measures to slow community spread.

Some of this is anecdotal (I have friends living in Northern Italy) but it's not hard to find articles by doctors setting this crisis out: https://www.itv.com/news/2020-03-11/italy-doctors-coronavirus-covid-19-quarantine-milan-health/ 

We need to close schools, shops, workplaces. Forget the fucking state of the economy and the obvious dire inconvenience of shutting down the country - Australian lives must be prioritised. 

Two weeks from now, we are going to be exactly where Italy is now - best case scenario. We *need* to flatten the curve or more people are going to die, and we need to stop treating preventative action as ""panic"" (not counting the whole bog rolls thing - you only have one ass, people)."

Since young people have relatively minor symptoms for the most part and low mortality (not 0, though, patient 1 in Italy was a healthy 38 years old who spent 2 weeks fighting death on a respirator), the worst thing that can happen to a young person is to bring home to their older parents and grandparents the contagion.

*Journal of Medical Virology, published March 11.*

*If confirmed with other research, it suggests SARS-2 might be a product of genetic engineering. Bats and carp don't consort that much in nature. This is being low key censored because it would make the public go ape shit.*

*EDIT: to add the following excerpt*

>*SARS-CoV-2 were identified in two separate cDNA pools. The first pool was from a Carassius auratus (crusian carp) cell line and the second was from Ctenopharyngodon idella(grass carp) head kidney tissue (6, 7)*

*Turns out both these samples to the database were submitted from Wuhan.*

*So let's examine some of the coincidences so far:*

*-- a new bat derived coronavirus appears in a market close to the only lab in China known to be working with bat derived corona viruses*

*-- the new virus has a bizarre genetic overlap with the carp genome*

*-- the carp genome was submitted by researchers working out of Wuhan*

*-- the new virus has slight but functionally important genetic similarities to HIV; not a smoking gun, but the only coronavirus with said mutation... but wait! no there is one in nature with this mutation... published Jan 20, after the outbreak started... from researchers working out of -- you guessed it -- Wuhan*

*I won't explicitly say it, because people get banned and censored for doing so, and more importantly, these days I am happy if I can simply get my aged mother and people like her to avoid gatherings and wear a mask. I don't want to distance myself further from the mainstream narration. There isn't too much to be gained focusing on the origin at this point. That will need to come later though. We want to deal with this in a way that doesn't devolve into letting nukes fly.*

Might offer some different things different from what Governor Cuomo proposed + on a state level.

Might live edit/reply as things happen.

* Bill de Blasio proposes + signs for a state of emergency in New York City. 

* Bill de Blasio agrees with the state proposition to ban public gatherings of >500 people for as long as COVID-19 becomes an issue. No sports, no venues/concerts, no parades. Broadway ban occurs tonight.

* On the subject of “non-essential gatherings” like restaurants, small businesses, and other things, some businesses would want to remain open, and it’s understandable some may inevitably close for the future. Yes, it’s going to be a disruption in NYC culture to see those institutions gradually change and/or shut down too, but the Mayor proposes he’ll do his best to help out small businesses stay afloat and hopes to depend on federal aid, if possible. Protecting NYC culture, NYC schools, the MTA, should be a priority.

* Mayor estimates COVID-19 outbreak might take from 6 months to a year to fully resolve.

* 95 cases in NYC (+2 since yesterday) of COVID-19. 

* Westchester county lawyer who worked in Manhattan removed from the equation, results will only focus on NYC 

* 25 from Manhattan, 25 from Brooklyn, and more from the other boroughs.

* 29 in mandatory quarantine

* + 1000 in voluntary quarantine

* First case of a person leaving mandatory quarantine to return back to normal life in NYC.

* Mayor is optimistic people will self resolve and heal.

* Rent issues, eviction notices, the city will offer free legal help / 311 hotline to work on a healthy landlord-renter relationship during COVID-19 outbreak.

* For those with employment issues / little money, the office of Social Services promise to have food relief in the city.

* Mayor wants to see federal aid come immediately.

* Mayor has hopes on the House of Representatives/ Senate / President signing a stimulus package.

* NYC Schools will remain open, for the time being. Extra curricular activities will be cancelled.

* A “potential case” of a student in the Bronx schools. Not confirmed by city / DoE so far. Mayor depending on confirmation ASAP. Those two schools in the area (Mott Haven, Bronx) will be closed for cleaning, was a “good choice”. Schools going with deep clean initiative starting today. No students are under “tier 1” status with COVID-19 cases , no students have pre-existing conditions.

* City workforce will have 10% work from home / telecommuting. Those who can’t telecommute will be expected to show to work (35,000 telecommute ?). 20% will be on “staggered schedules”, and minimize commuting/travel but required to show for work (78,000 people).

* Private workforce will have changes too, listed below:

* Tech companies are expected to telecommute/WFH.

* Macy’s will try to make accommodations to reduce workers from physically appearing in stores.

* Mayor wants workers to be able to telecommute/WFH if possible, and have them retain their jobs & maintain an income.

* Special election for March 24 will go as intended, and without delay, as long as COVID-19 isn’t an issue.

* Mayor wants debate campaigning to change. No more door-to-door canvassing , no more rallies . He says digital friendly ads are still alright , and preferred.

* Early voting is still welcomed as a form of “social distancing”, that’s expected to still go on as intended.

* Mayor: 2020 Us Census is still a “huge issue”. Depends on federal government to cooperate with the city to either alter/delay and reduce volunteers/in person result gathering.

* Homeless population : 550 outreach workers will help homeless population and give them basic help. 764 homeless people agreed to help in city. No homeless people have COVID-19 or symptoms. 

* On Trump’s speech yesterday : Mayor still doesn’t like Trump’s rhetoric, and criticizes the president for making light on COVID-19 federal response. Wants a better upgrade of automatic testing for New Yorkers. More wide scale testing on a local level and independent from federal government.

* Mayor is pleased with the city response to how the COVID-19 quarantine treatment / synergy with citizens has been. “Far from over / will get worse before it gets better”. Mayor has hope the city will rebound from the disease and has hope people who have it will recover + survive.

* Mayor gives a brief summary and response in Spanish about the city’s plan to fix COVID-19

Q&A time :

* Mayor on question of private hospitals & local testing : Mayor again says he’s dissatisfied that Trump didn’t give the go ahead for easier local testing.

* Deputy Mayor : Assures that there will be enough medical supplies to handle the disease for now.

* Mayor on the estimated capacity the city can handle cases : Mayor hesitates to answer for now, but he says there’s plenty of variables, and sites the stat of 80% self resolve / non major , 20% major / hospitalization cases. When the city gets overwhelmed, the hospitals will set up temporary care centers wherever possible : parking lots, other spaces, to treat other cases.

* Another Official (chief hospital guy?) remains confident the city’s 11 primary hospitals will have enough to handle the initial COVID-19 serious cases. He also remains confident some cases will not be serious.

* Deputy mayor on 95 cases : most are in hospitals.

* Mayor on worst case scenario city life has to shut down with thousands of cases : he talked with Governor in person that they had to plan ahead with the case of public gatherings bans, and will coordinate on a city/state level. Unrealistic to see city life shut down , ie case of children w/o school , no MTA to shuffle employees and health staff around. Balance negative impacts with positives. City/state will work together.

* Mayor on testing , and possibility of emergency rooms overfilling : says there’s a bit of misunderstanding with Cornell report, and tons of misinformation. Wants fact checking. 1 emergency room had an uptick of normal activity. School attendance is higher than average. 

(ABC7NY wrapped up the news conference)

(Rewatching it again)

* Dr Barbot wants better insight on how other institutions get their testing done so NYC can do it too. NYC has been doing their own testing for 10 days now. Need FDA approval to do automated local testing. Those who don’t display symptoms are more than welcomed to get testing. 

* On when Mayor / Education chairman should shut down NYC schools : Mayor can’t give a definitive date so far , too many variables. Reiterates schools should be open unless if COVID-19 gets out of control. Safe spot to have kids for the day, some of the only place kids get food due to low income family / no time. 

* Chancellor Carranza agrees w/ mayor on state of schools.

* Mayor on lessons from 1919 Spanish flu : Dr. Barbot says social distancing is effective , but case of 1919 Spanish flu & NYC response now would be effective. 

* NYCHA might suspend evictions for the time being.

* Mayor on his bond w/ the Governor about misinformation : reiterates it’s not a good time for fake news, says fake news is getting out of control. Says leakers or derived from scenario planning are the culprits. Mayor will run more scenarios on the different possibilities of new cases. Mayor and Governor will collaborate with major actions on societal changes. 

* Mayor on “NYC citizens remaining calm” and wanting normalcy during the emergency : Has a strong view when truth and transparency is present . 

(Stopped watching this point because everything has been mentioned and repeated)

**In summary: 95 cases in NYC, schools will be opened, MTA still running,**

In the case of Alex Azar, he did go to the president in January. He did push past resistance from the president's political aides to warn the president the new coronavirus could be a major problem. There were aides around Trump - Kellyanne Conway had some skepticism at times that this was something that needed to be a presidential priority.

>But at the same time, Secretary Azar has not always given the president the worst-case scenario of what could happen. My understanding is he did not push to do aggressive additional testing in recent weeks, and that's partly because more testing might have led to more cases being discovered of coronavirus outbreak, and the president had made clear - the lower the numbers on coronavirus, the better for the president, the better for his potential reelection this fall.

USA infection is increasingly at at rate of 34% a day (1301 cases yesterday, 1747 now).

That means the USA infection numbers are doubling every 2.1 days.

Saturday night 10.6 cases per million.

Monday night /Tuesday morning 21.2 cases per million.

Thursday noon 42.4 cases per million.

Next Friday the USA will be where Spain is today.

Italy, today, is at 250 cases per million. 

By that math, in around 14 days the USA could be where Italy is today.

Then:
> In 2018, the Trump Administration cut 80 percent of CDC funding used to fight global pandemics. The funding support, which went to training local health professionals and bolstering emergency response across 49 countries, was reduced to just 10 nations. China wasn’t included in the revised list.

The program was behind the discovery of more than 1,000 viruses, including an Ebola strain.

2 reasons why this number should be taken with a grain of salt:   
1. Elderly people are more likely to die fast from this. What we are seeing right now is the least healthy people getting ravaged, but this doesnt mean healthier people cant die from this.   
2. In many italian hospitals triage has become necessary. This shifts medical aid from old to young people, in order to minimize deaths and therefore artificially increasing death rates within older demographics.   

I would heavily advise against making statistics like the one you did and rather look at mortality rate from closed cases overall:

There is a ton of confusion in the United States regarding testing. CDC guidelines only want us to test sick patients. Many states want to catch all cases including mild ones, and many physicians share that goal, as preventing huge surges in cases is dependent on capturing the mild cases and quarantining them but not all agree.

Demanding you be tested is not the right answer. There is a lot going on behind the scenes, such as the hospital policy, state health department policy, and CDC that makes testing each case difficult if not impossible.

For example, I am an ER doc in NY State. My hospital has taken the CDC guidelines to heart regarding testing of patients (basically only the sick get tested). We have to send it to NY state as we do not have the test ourselves, and they won’t even accept it if it doesn’t meet the strict CDC criteria, despite Cuomo’s ambitions of conducting wide testing. 

The administration has claimed any coronavirus test can be conducted by the CDC themselves if the physician requests it, but the experience of many of us is they won’t test unless it meets their strict criteria. 

This has exasperated many of us on the front lines, as we would love to be catching these mild cases, but we literally cannot get the test done. So yelling at us won’t help matters.

What needs to happen is private labs need to start opening up and offering to test for coronavirus on a broad scale before we can really see the scope of this. Believe me, us on the front lines are quite aware of the testing problem and we want to be able to test more, but it’s not necessarily in our hands"

Children are also free riders to some degree, BUT, they through their parents are big consumers of all sorts of goods and services and when they are grown they will be the drones who work to make the oligarchs richer, and they will do so (most of them) for 3-4 decades before they become a drain.

Everyone else is shut down.  The XFL carries on as normal, announces there will be no changes to the schedule whatsoever and invites fans to attend as normal.  Of course, the whole world looks at them like they've lost their goddamn mind...until Vince drops the bombshell.

Vince's spending on the XFL included one little extra detail.  Paying scientists to come up with a functional vaccine against the coronavirus, which he has.  He won't be selling it, and he won't be giving it away.  The only way to get the vaccine is with the purchase of a season ticket package to an XFL team, and when those sell out, with a certain number of individual tickets bought, and when those sell out, a certain amount of XFL merchandise purchased.

The XFL becomes the only game in town, and being it's the only sport being discussed, the year or two it has no competition cements it as a permanent part of the sporting world.  TV contracts in place on all major networks that net billions upon billions in short order.

On Vince's deathbed, once there's no undoing the XFL, he admits that not only did he pay for the vaccine against coronavirus, he also paid for the creation of coronavirus.  He commissioned it, had it put in China and allowed them to take the blame, knowing how quickly it would spread, knowing it would shut down every league except his own.

second, viruses spread exponentially. you get sick, unknowingly infect 5-6 other people who then go infect a few more each. in english, this hoe gets around and FAST. it is extraordinary easy for infection to occur through sneezing and coughing. surfaces that are sneezed and coughed on can carry the virus for a few days and can still infect people who never came into contact with the sick individual. there’s no cure or treatment available, all we can do is test (which is not happening nearly enough) 

the CDC believes due to how easily this thing is spread there’s a very good chance that most of the country will be exposed to the coronavirus, while the current risk remains generally low for the country **that is going to change significantly in the coming months**

the danger in this is the overload of the countries medical system, further compounding the danger and death rates for serious cases unable to get treatment and people in other life threatening situations from getting treatment for their specific instance as well. 

i hate it just as much as everyone else, i miss college basketball and lacrosse, and i miss my brothers and being the degenerate alcoholic god put me on this earth to be. this thing WILL get worse, this thing WILL kill more people, and we need to take it seriously to limit the damage since containment failed. 


the numbers we have are those that are getting tested or seeking treatment, the real number is impossible to count but assuredly much higher than what we have. 


*a personal note, there is no reason to compare the numbers from previous pandemics like swine flu because those were years ago and you’re getting the after-action report, while we’re currently in the beginning of this pandemic*

No, you could die. You shouldn't spread misinformation like this.

2% is *incredibly high* for an infectious disease to kill people. That's 10x as lethal as a bad seasonal flu. Most people know about 250-300 family, friends, and acquaintances. Imagine if 6 people you know died tomorrow. That's what we're talking about here. 2% of 350 million Americans is *7 million dead Americans*.

Roughly 3,000 people died on 9/11. If coronavirus kills 2% of Americans (assuming a 100% infection rate which is not really plausible) that's one 9/11 every day for **7 years.** Let's say it infects 50% of the population (which is pretty plausible, given that most estimates are between 30-60% will be infected). That's still the equivalent of a 9/11 every day for **3.5 years.**

This has the potential to absolutely devastate the U.S. and we are not prepared for it whatsoever. You should be alarmed."

Just watch what is happening around the world not what people are saying. China shut down the entire country,  Italy completely locked down, England closed schools for 2 months. We don't do stuff like this for the flu. People don't wear full PPE for the flu. Authorities don't disinfect entire city streets with water cannons for the flu.

That said, the MSM and liberals will attack Trump no matter what he does. I see people going on about how he didn't think this Europe travel ban through. If he didn't do it they're gonna attack him for not banning travel from Europe.

Our level of unpreparedness mirrors how Italy originally responded to the spread of COVID-19 approximately 1-2 weeks ago. in the coming weeks, I fully expect the elderly and the vulnerable population will become very sick and some will require intensive level of care. As the author of this [article](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2020/03/who-gets-hospital-bed/607807/) points out, Italy (and the US in my opinion) does not have the intensive care capacity as well as the mechanical ventilators for their patients. The doctors at both emergency departments as well as intensive care units have to decide who gets mechanical ventilators and who does not, essentially deciding who gets a chance to fight.

AND THIS SCARES ME.

I urge you to please tell your parents and your grandparents (and everyone else) to avoid public gatherings and to treat every surface in the public as if it is infected with the coronavirus. We might be too late in this pandemic, but we might not be. The only thing we can do now is to slow down the spread of this highly infectious disease."

But for now, the US doesn't have the test -- it doesn't have approval from the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA).] (https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/12/asia/coronavirus-south-korea-testing-intl-hnk/index.html)


**Main points from article**

* Seegene is one of four companies providing coronavirus test kits in South Korea.

* The company houses an *artificial intelligence-based big data system*, which has enabled the firm to quickly develop a test for coronavirus. It was only the third time the company had used its super computer -- rather than its research and development team working manually -- to design a test. The company was able to design the test using only the genetic details that had been released about the virus, and without having a sample of Covid-19.

* The company is also facing international demand from about 30 countries -- including Italy and Germany -- which are using Seegene's products, Chun said.

* The firm is making about 10,000 kits a week and each kit can test 100 patients. So it is making enough to test one million patients each week, at a cost of under *$20 per test*.

* Rather than a human mixing the solutions, the samples are instead put into a diagnostic machine. Inside the machine, a robot arm pipettes the solution and mixes the liquids on a number of tests at once. According to Chun, this method takes only four hours to test samples from 94 patients -- *four times faster than the manual method*. It also reduces the risk of human error or contamination.

* There are three genes that can be tested for to confirm coronavirus -- and *Seegene's kits are able to test for all three genes in one tube*, said Chun. That's not necessarily the case for all test kits.

* Chun believes *if the United States had access to Seegene's system, the country could test 1 million patients a week. But for now, the US doesn't have the test -- it doesn't have approval from the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA).*"

What they'd actually agreed to was waive it for *testing*.

The problem is that if you start quarantining/hospitalizing people who test positive, and none of that treatment is fully covered, you're turning a positive test into a potentially multi-thousand dollar commitment. A lot of people will simply refuse to get tested for financial reasons. 

This is really one of those times when the profit motive shouldnot be guiding our decision making. We need to be coming together as a whole society on this. It's saddening to see so many companies refuse to do that."

-reducing mass production

-stopping unnecessary carbon emissions from travels

-a bunch of companies are changing the way they’re running things so people can stay home to self-quarantine and things that were denied to people with disabilities because it’s inconvenient or “impossible” 

-reevaluating food systems which is necessary to fight the climate crisis but was “impossible” until the coronavirus

-making massive personal sacrifices bc of this whereas we’re told it’s impossible to do so when it comes to the climate crisis 

-oil prices are plunging 

-the US gov is willing to offer free testing and potentially treatment, and yet the most contentious issue in the democratic primaries has been universal healthcare which is “impossible” except for this pandemic apparently

-people are awarded free/paid sick days from work and school where beforehand that was “impossible” for companies. 

Apparently structural changes are only “possible” if it fits within capital interest. I just hope the collective remembers this when the virus passes and we continue to fight for actual change for the climate crisis/class struggle

School emphasizes sanitation over everything. None of your talent or ability matter if you give someone an infection. Not that you can’t be self taught and have good hygiene practices. But anyone self taught should at least take a class on sanitizing for the pro mua. Coronavirus is showing how easily things can spread.

For the past 30 years, from my hospital observation unit, I’ve been through many sanitary crisis, HIV, SARS, MERS, tuberculosis resurgence, multidrug resistant bacteria, we handled them calmly and efficiently.

None of them resulted in the current panic.

I have never seen such a degree of concerns for an infectious disease, or any other kind of disease for that matter.

And yet, I am not worried regarding the medical consequences for the coronavirus. Nothing in the current numbers about mortality and spreading rate justifies the worldwide panic, sanitarily-wise and especially economically-wise.

Measures that are being taken are adapted and efficient and will allow us to handle the pandemic. It is already the case in China, initial home of the virus and by far the biggest one, where the pandemic is dying down.

Time will tell if I was mistaken.

However,

· I am worried about the masks being stolen; as well as the ones being distributed in airports, cafes and shopping malls, while they are needed to protect medical staff and people who are actually at risk (our elders and the people who are already sick, particularly immunosuppressed ones).

· I am worried about sanitizing gels being stolen.

· I am worried about those brawls happening where people buy toilet paper, rice and pasta.

· I am worried about this terror that leads people to stockpile obscene amounts of food in countries where the available quantity of food is just as obscene.

· I am worried about our elders, already lonely, that we can’t see and touch anymore because we’re afraid to kill them. They’ll die faster, but “only” from loneliness. We already had the habit not to visit our parents and grand parents when we had the flu, not the one of avoiding them “just in case” and for an undetermined amount of time. Nothing is different for the coronavirus.

· I am worried about Health becoming a subject of belligerent communication and conflicts like any other subject, when it should be our ultimate cause to fight and stick together.

· I am worried about the possibility that our healthcare system, already struggling, could get overwhelmed by a surge of people showing up at the first flu-like symptom. Then, it’s all the other disease that we cannot take care of. A heart attack, or an appendicitis is always an emergency; a virus very rarely is.

The media coverage of the coronavirus is extremely anxiogenic and is freaking out everyone.

This conducts to the craziest conspiracy theories like “they’re hiding something from us”. Nothing is obscure. It is impossible in medicine, within this digital world where scientific knowledge is immediate and without filter.

The coronavirus kills (almost) exclusively weakened organisms.

I am worried that this tiny living being may only unveil the huge cracks and weaknesses of our societies. The millions of deaths that we will count will be the ones from the clashes between individuals who didn’t care about the collective interest.

Amsterdam: It has long been tradition for an elite group of flower growers to sweep through the fields of the Netherlands in early April. Their colourful haul is blessed by the Bishop of Rotterdam before being shipped to the Vatican, where it is carefully arranged to frame the Pope during Easter Sunday Mass.

Chief designer Paul Deckers has been part of the ritual since 1988. But not this year. His plans are in ruins as the coronavirus pandemic radiates across Europe.

""Given the developments and the measures which have been taken in Italy we decided not to take any risks,"" Deckers says. He doesn't think the event in St Peter's Square will even go ahead.

As COVID-19 spreads across the continent, other decisions of much greater consequence loom. Some are matters of actual life or death. Doctors in Italy this week published guidelines warning that patients over a certain age might have to be left to die so that scarce intensive care beds can be given to younger people with a better chance of survival.

""Resources may have to be used first for those with a higher probability of survival and, secondly, who has the most years of life left, and offer the maximum number of benefits to the majority of people,"" the advice warned.

The scale and impact of the Italian outbreak has stunned the world. The country has been shut down under emergency measures not seen since World War II. Its economy has been paralysed. Anyone who goes outside is being stopped by police or the military and asked to produce evidence about why they are there. Total infections have now surpassed 15,000 and more than than 1000 people have died in a fortnight.

Many European leaders mistakenly believed the situation could be contained. But something snapped this week and what is now abundantly clear is that Italy is no outlier - it is merely a frontrunner.

On current trajectories Germany, France, Spain, Britain, Sweden, Belgium, Norway and Switzerland will all soon record the same high number of infections as Italy. In Belgium, Switzerland, the Netherlands, France, Australia, Sweden, Greece, Spain and Britain, the total number of cases has been roughly doubling every two days as community transmission takes hold.

Most of the worst-affected European nations are now about 10 days away from catching up to Italy's current position, but some have been gifted as many as three to four weeks to prepare for the deluge.

Leaders are now grappling with how to use that time. School and university closures have been popular, so too bans on mass gatherings. Some countries - such as the Czech Republic - have banned flights from certain parts of Europe, and Austria isn't letting people from Italy over the border without a doctor's certificate. In Belgium, all restaurants, bars and gyms have been ordered to close.

Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar on Thursday banned all indoor gatherings of 100 or more people. Even St Patrick's Day parades have been axed.

""It’s going to involve big changes in the way we live our lives,"" Varadkar said. ""And I know I’m asking people to make enormous sacrifices. But we’re doing it for each other.""

One country isn't following the crowd, however. As the rest of Europe gradually switches off its economy and large parts of society, the British government has resisted enacting any so-called social distancing measures. If anything, Prime Minister Boris Johnson has condemned them as counter-productive.

Johnson calls the virus the ""worst public health crisis for a generation"" and admits it will spread to all corners of Britain. But armed with reams of modelling and relying heavily on the advice of his chief medical and science officers, he is holding his nerve on when to clamp down.

The plan is to essentially wait until the crisis worsens before implementing social distancing. Officials believe the peak of the emergency is still up to 14 weeks away and say behavioural science modelling shows the public will get sick of draconian measures if they are implemented too early.

""If you start too early and then people's enthusiasm [to comply with the measures] runs out just at the peak, which is exactly the time we want people to be complying with these interventions, that is actually not a productive way to do it,"" says England's chief medical officer Chris Whitty.

For now, the British government is urging all people with flu-like symptoms to stay at home for seven days and if possible, away from family members. Most will not be offered testing for coronavirus.

Britain's chief scientific adviser Patrick Vallance says asking people with mild symptoms to self-isolate could reduce the peak of the pandemic by 20 to 25 per cent, and asking whole households to self-isolate could achieve a further reduction of 25 per cent. On top of that, eventually limiting the general population's access to the elderly and people with pre-existing medical conditions could lower the eventual death rate by 20 to 30 per cent.

""Those are the three most important measures to take,"" Vallance told reporters in Downing Street. ""It doesn't mean other things don't have additional effects as well, but those are the ones which have the biggest effect and therefore they need to come in first.""

He also says closing schools would have minimal impact and classes would have to be suspended for up to four months to make any material difference to the rate of spread.

In a line graph form, Italy's outbreak will ultimately resemble an upside down capital 'U'. This curve means the pandemic may pass more quickly but the impact on the health system of such a massive short-term caseload is severe.

The British government says its strategy will flatten that curve and spread out the infections out over a longer period - Johnson calls it ""squashing the sombrero"". The social distancing measures put in place by other countries should achieve the same effect but Britain's plan is using different techniques to achieve it.

Not everyone is convinced. Former British health secretary Jeremy Hunt - Johnson's opponent in last year's Conservative leadership contest - says he is ""concerned"" only four weeks remain before Britain finds itself in the same situation as Italy and ""what we do every single day of those four weeks is absolutely critical"".

""The point of taking drastic measures is to slow the onslaught on the National Health Service. If five per cent of the population gets the virus and five per cent of those people need an intensive care bed, that's over 150,000 people who will need intensive care and we only have 4000 beds.""

But Johnson is holding firm and even took a swipe at other countries for a need to ""be seen to act"" which means they ""may do things that are not necessarily dictated by the science"".

The contrast with the rest of Europe couldn't be sharper - and the stakes could not be higher if Johnson and his team have gambled on the wrong strategy."

Granted, the global market collapse is for sure a rough one and will continue over the next months, but I don't get people selling now purely based on price action.

Yeah VET has been under-performing for 2 years and counting, but to me that's hardly relevant as this is not an asset for which speculation matters. Some days ago people were discussing what would make them quit the boat: Sunny quitting, DNV-GL leaving the project and so on.

I don't see this discussed much, but what is making me stay invested is China itself. Geopolitically speaking, China is rising hard and achieved a growth state where it can start challenging global powers. Its main transition focus has been to exit the factory-nation status and reach a consumer based economy like first world nations. This has been working extremely well, so well that western powers are trying to tone China's growth down (see recent Huawei shenanigans and US/China trade war). 

Nonetheless, China's is starting to create a multi-polar world order, and with the decline of the West, should it be Europe or the US, it's poised to become one of if not the main global super power of the comings decades. And China's strategy to achieve such status is based on raw economical power through investment (Belt&Road), education (forecasts predict China to become the main producer of engineers in the world), technology/innovation (5G, blockchain) and military.

I don't think people understand how absolutely humongous the FoodGate partnership is. That is China saying ""Hey, we're betting on blockchain technology for the current core project defining our ambition for decades to come (Belt&Road), in order to set completely new standards for the supply chain industry and consumer habits"".
That is China's bet on technology based, among other things, on Vechain. That mains Vechain is now the main freaking state sponsored public blockchain company. I mean, fucking hell. This is not even an overstatement. Factually speaking, this proves Vechain to be one of the main focus for blockchain technology by Beijing. 

Now seeing how fast China started recovering from a major pandemic and the future its building for years to come, I'm not worried a single second. Just look at the shitstorm the coronavirus is going to cause in the US and how that will spread to other states. China clearly has other major problems though, but looking with a cold view at it, nation building and economical growth surely isn't one.

Formula One world champion Lewis Hamilton has savaged the sport’s administrators for forging ahead with the Australian Grand Prix as the world grapples with the coronavirus, suggesting the decision was influenced by cash.

Hamilton said it was ""shocking"" that crowds were congregating at Albert Park in Melbourne for the event while other major sports around the world are taking drastic measures to contain the spread of the virus.

I am really very, very surprised that we’re here,” Hamilton said on the opening day of the four-day event.

“I think it’s great that we have races but for me it’s shocking that we’re all sitting in this room.

“So many fans [are'] already [here] today. It seems like the rest of the world is reacting probably a little bit late [to the virus] yet Formula One continues to go on.

“It’s a concern for the people here. It’s quite a big circus that is coming. It’s definitely concerning for me.”

On Thursday (AEDT) the NBA was shut down after one Utah Jazz player tested positive for the virus.

The Bahrain Grand Prix is slated to go ahead without crowds on March 22."

He's tortured by his inability to maintain a relationship because of the nature of his career, and increasingly, because of his fixation with the Enterprise herself. The former lovers he runs into on every starbase are signifiers of his failure to cultivate a successful relationship, not testaments to his libido. That's what makes his decision to blow up the Enterprise in The Search for Spock so meaningful, and why in the later original movies he's such a rulebreaker compared to how straight-laced he was on the show, because he's managed to outgrow the fixation that had dominated him throughout the prime of his life (fittingly, it took the destruction of his last real chance at building a family - and, symbolically, his youth - for him to outgrow it).

But those measures didn't completely stop the coronavirus from getting out, and it still grew into a pandemic. The lockdowns bought time, but the virus still escaped them.

I work in a community hospital in MA and our hospital is currently not prepared for this pandemic. I personally know several people in the Boston area who presumably has COVID-19 based on their symptoms. However, due to testing kits not being widey available and testing has to be approved by the MA Department of Public Health, we are currently unable to test anyone we want to. This goes to show the number of infected individuals in the Boston area is significantly higher than the number that has been reported (~80). Based on epidemiological data available, the number of infected doubles every 7 DAYS (citation upon request).

Our level of unpreparedness mirrors how Italy originally responded to the spread of COVID-19 approximately 1-2 weeks ago. in the coming weeks, I fully expect the elderly and the vulnerable population will become very sick and some will require intensive level of care. As the author of this [article](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2020/03/who-gets-hospital-bed/607807/) points out, Italy (and the US in my opinion) does not have the intensive care capacity as well as the mechanical ventilators for their patients. The doctors at both emergency departments as well as intensive care units have to decide who gets mechanical ventilators and who does not, essentially deciding who gets a chance to fight.

AND THIS SCARES ME.

I urge you to please tell your parents and your grandparents (and everyone else) to avoid public gatherings and to treat every surface in the public as if it is infected with the coronavirus. We might be too late in this pandemic, but we might not be. The only thing we can do now is to slow down the spread of this highly infectious disease."

>If even 5 percent of the 325 million people living in America get Covid-19, the current data suggests 20 percent of them — 3.2 million people — will require hospitalization and 6 percent — 960,000 people — will require beds in intensive care units for many days. Covid-19 patients will simply overwhelm our health care system.

>This worry about shortages of medical staff and equipment is not theoretical. China had so many coronavirus patients that they had to build new hospitals and choose between treating Covid-19 patients and those with other illnesses. Italy appears to be facing shortages of ventilators and intensive care unit beds.

Five stages of epidemic control show how a society like Taiwan survives this viral outbreak. Others must do the same.


Tim Culpan is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering technology. He previously covered technology for Bloomberg News.




In late May 2003, I had to go to a funeral.

The deceased was the head nurse at a hospital in Taiwan. She died from severe acute respiratory syndrome, or SARS. I’d never met her. I was there in my capacity as a reporter, trying to observe, to learn, to stay out of the way. 

Sitting at the back of the funeral hall was the head of her hospital. Mask on. Forlorn. He knew the role he’d played in her death. His denial that there were new cases of the virus had led to a wider outbreak. The nurse was one of 73 people who died from 346 cases 1 in Taiwan, making it one of the worst-hit places from the fast-moving, lethal disease that claimed more than 770 lives in 17 countries.

The tragedy, culminating in a white-clad funeral hall, was a case study in what I now see as a pattern in how societies deal with impending epidemics, and is of crucial importance as the world grapples with the coronavirus called Covid-19.

Echoes of Taiwan’s previous mistakes rang out in January this year in Wuhan. One of the earliest voices to warn of a strange new respiratory illness was a doctor chastised by authorities who didn’t want to face the reality of what was happening. It was only after Li Wenliang’s death that the government joined citizens in lauding his work. 

By burying their heads in the sand, Beijing and the local government failed. They compounded that mistake through censorship and evading the truth. Authorities tried to rectify their initial mistakes with draconian measures, including shutting down the entire city of Wuhan.

China isn’t alone in struggling to adapt to this disaster. Countries around the world — from Iran and Italy, to South Korea and Japan and the U.S. — are going through elements of the same cycle. In 1969, psychiatrist Elisabeth Kubler-Ross described the now-famous five stages of grief experienced by terminally ill patients: denial, anger, bargaining, depression and acceptance. Though not precisely the same, I’m seeing similarities to how societies handle an epidemic crisis. How fast they work through the stages will determine how well they fight Covid-19.

Almost everywhere, first, there has been internal denial: Authorities or populations don’t believe it’s real, despite what they’re told by people who know better. The next step is external denial. Under authoritarian regimes, this comes in the form of censorship. In open societies, it’s attacks on message-bearers, including media and experts. In some places, it’s a mix of both.

Third comes action. Sometimes over-reaction. Sometimes brutal, desperate or flailing. But eventually the mechanisms of authority get put to work in tackling the outbreak. How successful they are depends on how quickly they got through these first three stages.

Then comes the blame game. Governments, media, victims, experts and the public all point fingers. In Taiwan during the SARS era, that blame rested firmly on the shoulders of a few health officials. Then, the fifth and final stage, when people are ready to believe that the worst is over, comes self-congratulation at a job well done. President Xi Jinping’s visit to Wuhan  this week is part of the broader propaganda campaign aimed at glorifying the Chinese government’s efforts.

By late April 2003, Taiwan knew SARS was a problem. The pneumonia-like illness had already popped up in mainland China and spread to Hong Kong, reaching Taiwan by early March. Further imported cases had put health authorities on alert. But the president of Taipei Municipal Hoping Hospital got caught up in denial, delaying action.

“A lapse in infection control in a single hospital allowed the outbreak, which had been under good control, to escalate,” David Heymann, the World Health Organization’s executive director for communicable diseases, later wrote of Taiwan’s experience.  

By the time of the funeral service, the hospital president had been fired. Also losing his job was the health minister, replaced by a respected Johns Hopkins University-trained epidemiologist named Chen Chien-jen. 

Containment

Taiwan has one of the lowest Covid-19 case counts in the rest of the world helped by early recognition and action against the potential threat


Taiwan’s strength is its open society. Political institutions have matured a lot in the past 17 years and where democracy means that citizens have a real connection to their representatives. Experts are respected. President Tsai Ing-wen is a former professor. The vice president is that same respected epidemiologist:  Chen Chien-jen.

On Jan. 20 this year, Taiwan’s Centers for Disease Control activated its Central Epidemic Command Center to coordinate efforts against the new virus. That was three days before China put Wuhan on lockdown and the first meeting of the WHO’s emergency committee. Significantly, it came before Taiwan had even recorded its first case.

The government skipped quickly through the internal and external denial phases. While many Taiwanese were yet to be convinced about the dangers, most trusted that the actions taken, such as temperature checks at buildings and use of masks, were reasonable. A shortage was alleviated when volunteers, and then the government itself, started collating and publishing locations and inventories of masks so people knew where to shop. The result was caution, rather than panic.

Other societies are going through the cycle of crisis in different ways. Italy moved through denial pretty quickly, with Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte putting his entire nation on lockdown and acknowledging “we need to change our habits right now.” South Korea’s government jumped into action while Hong Kong fumbled early on. The situation looks more bleak for countries like Iran and the U.S. that haven’t fully broken out of stages one and two. 

Eventually they will, because denial can only last so long. Circumstances will dictate action. The only question is how quickly."

He's given press conferences where he said the cases would effectively go away. He has posted tweets, even on Monday where he compared this to the flu. This is not the flu. The flu does not lead the National Basketball Association, the NBA, to suspend its season.

>I think it's a positive that the president seems to finally realize the severity of the problem. Unfortunately, his short remarks contained a lot of mistakes and misinformation. **The president said that travel from Europe would be suspended for 30 days. That wasn't completely correct. The White House had to immediately walk that back.** U.S. citizens and their families and legal permanent residents can still come back. The president said that cargo would be banned from Europe. That would have been a huge blow to the economy, especially given that some crucial medical supplies come from the EU. But it turned out that Trump misspoke again; cargo will still be allowed.

>**The president said that health insurers had waived the cost of treatment for coronavirus. That's no small thing. Patients who are afflicted can end up in the hospital for weeks. That could have been a multibillion-dollar decision. But as my Politico colleague Sarah Owermohle first reported, insurers had only waived the cost of testing, and that had already been established in White House meetings.**

>And then the broader moves and the president's language confounded and concerned public health experts. The president repeatedly leaned into phrases like, this is a foreign virus, that Europe is now a source of America's problems. On one level, he's right; the virus came out of China, and that country's leadership has a lot to answer for in how they initially screwed up the response. I think the Trump administration did have good reason to shut down China travel in late January, given the uncertainty about the new outbreak.

>But at this point, the virus is here. It's silently spreading. And locking down more borders may not help us very much and only alienate allies that we need to fight a global war on disease. 

Trump is dangerously incompetent and this [news](https://www.npr.org/2020/03/12/814881355/white-house-knew-coronavirus-would-be-a-major-threat-but-response-fell-short) isn't reassuring."

ACE-Inhibitors that many people take for high blood preasure influence ACE2 expression too, it is the way they work.

People taking pills for their bloodpreasure or consuming nicotin seem to have a much higher risk."

Think of them like CDs you could buy at a bank. In theory, they're worth a certain amount of money, but at any given point in time you can't always access the money. Most of a bank's money sits in these assets because over time they accrue value, where as sitting a vault they'd hypothetically lose value to inflation. This is the normal state of affairs.

This week, all hell broke loose and a lot of people want their money out of the banks in case they need it for ... well, coronavirus. The banks have the money ... but a lot of it is locked up in these assets. 

The Fed is loaning banks $500 Billion dollars a month each month for three months, and charging interest, and holding these assets as collateral if the banks default, for a total of $1.5 trillion dollars of very liquid cash flowing into the system to meet demand. 

The Fed could and probably should consider interventions that are targeted at consumers more directly, but the traditional theology on this is that such matters are the purview of our duly elected representatives in Congress.

If we're going to accept the conspiracy theory that coronavirus was released deliberately by the Chinese govt. I believe that their motivations are different.


As a result of the one child policy, China has a rapidly ageing population and was heading for financial ruin when the current working generation (their largest generation ever) reached retirement age. So they released the virus which targeted almost exclusively the elderly, thus bringing down the average age and reducing the potential future burden on their social state.


Also, isn't the collapse of the economy associated with the pandemic going to be good for China in the long run?"

In the most scripted of presidential settings, a prime-time televised address to the nation, President Trump decided to ad-lib — and his errors triggered a market meltdown, panicked travelers overseas and crystallized for his critics just how dangerously he has fumbled his management of the coronavirus.

Even Trump — a man practically allergic to admitting mistakes — knew he’d screwed up by declaring Wednesday night that his ban on travel from Europe would include cargo and trade, and acknowledged as much to aides in the Oval Office as soon as he’d finished speaking, according to one senior administration official and a second person, both with knowledge of the episode.

Jared Kushner, his son-in-law and senior adviser who has seized control over some aspects of the government’s coronavirus response, reassured Trump that aides would correct his misstatement, four administration officials said, and they scrambled to do just that. The president also told staffers to make sure other countries did not believe trade would be affected, and even sent a cleanup tweet of his own: “The restriction stops people not goods,” he wrote.

Other administration officials rushed to alert the public that U.S. citizens would be exempt from the travel ban, after scores of Americans, upon digesting Trump’s speech, phoned government offices and raced to airports in Europe out of concern that they would not be able to fly home.

Trump’s 10-minute Oval Office address Wednesday night reflected not only his handling of the coronavirus crisis but, in some ways, much of his presidency. It was riddled with errors, nationalist and xenophobic in tone, limited in its empathy, and boastful of both his own decisions and the supremacy of the nation he leads.

Futures for the Dow Jones industrial average fell in real time with virtually each word Trump uttered, signaling a lack of confidence among investors that he had control of the crisis and previewing another bloodbath once the markets opened Thursday morning.

Trump — who believed that by giving the speech he would appear in command and that his remarks would reassure financial markets and the country — was in “an unusually foul mood” and sounded at times “apoplectic” on Thursday as he watched stocks tumble and digested widespread criticism of his speech, according to a former senior administration official briefed on his private conversations.
This official, like many others interviewed for this story, spoke on the condition of anonymity to share sensitive information or make candid assessments.

Ben Rhodes, a senior White House aide who helped former president Barack Obama script and manage his responses to numerous crises, predicted that Wednesday night’s address will stand as “the moment people associate with the fact that Donald Trump failed the biggest test of his presidency.”

I think we’ll look back on this as a defining moment of the Trump presidency because it speaks to larger concerns that people already had about Trump — that he can’t tell the truth, that he doesn’t value expertise, that he doesn’t take the presidency seriously enough,” Rhodes said.

As often is the case after Trump gives a major speech, his Republican allies offered a chorus of praise on television and social media for his “fantastic speech” and “decisive actions” and “unique strength.”

Inside the White House, however, aides and advisers privately acknowledged that Trump failed to accomplish the primary goal of his speech — reassuring the nation — and described it as disappointing and far from his best performance.

Trump’s speech contained at least two errors and a significant omission. He said the travel ban would apply to cargo; it did not. He said health insurance companies would waive patients’ co-payments for coronavirus testing and treatment; industry officials later clarified that they would waive payments for testing only. And he did not fully explain the details of his travel restrictions, leaving out the fact that U.S. citizens would be exempt.

The president’s remarks were devoid of much substantive information on other matters. Trump provided no update for citizens on the spread of the virus, nor on the availability and results of testing.

Public health experts have said testing citizens for the coronavirus is essential for identifying new cases and limiting its spread, but the nation has experienced a chronic shortage of test kits after weeks of missteps by the government. Trump devoted only two short sentences to the topic, and they were vague: “Testing and testing capabilities are expanding rapidly, day by day. We are moving very quickly.”

Stylistically, the president himself seemed ill at ease in the formal setting, offering a monotone and labored delivery from behind the Resolute Desk, twiddling his thumbs and even, in moments, struggling to read words on the teleprompter. One senior administration official said Trump’s heart was not in the speech.

“It was jolting,” said Julian Zelizer, a presidential historian at Princeton University. “People are naturally scared. People want to see a leader who has a commanding presence. In some ways, the country is worse off after a message like that.”

The speech itself was rushed. After weeks of playing down the coronavirus’s threat to the United States, Trump was reluctant to appreciate the full scope of the crisis on his hands. But with the markets in free fall, he decided early Wednesday that he wanted to give the televised speech that night, administration officials said. This startled some of his aides and set off a frantic scramble to arrange airtime on television networks, iron out logistics for his delivery and prepare a draft of what he would say, the officials said.

“This was a real missed opportunity to not just have a couple of sentences in there about how other people need to put partisanship aside and come together, but to really show it,” the former senior administration official said, noting that Trump could have sought to rise above the politics of the moment to convey a sense of unity and common purpose.

“The speech almost writes itself in a way,” this person added. “It can be kind of formulaic. It’s not rocket science.”

The speech was largely written by Kushner and senior policy adviser Stephen Miller, who were still making tweaks to the text until moments before Trump delivered it, according to people familiar with the process. Thirty minutes before Trump appeared live on camera, a final draft of his remarks still had not circulated widely within the White House, one of those people said. And senior health experts in the administration did not review a final draft of the remarks, according to a senior administration official.

While Kushner and Miller crafted the remarks, a coterie of other officials were involved in the process and joined Trump in the Oval Office to watch his delivery. One person with knowledge of the speech said they included Vice President Pence, Ivanka Trump, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar, and a sizable group of White House aides: Christopher Liddell, Eric Ueland, Dan Scavino, Hogan Gidley, Judd Deere, John McEntee, Anthony Ornato and Nick Luna.

Some officials faulted the rushed timeline for the messy speech, which they said could have been delivered even sooner, as it became clear the virus was well on its way to becoming a global pandemic — a designation the World Health Organization officially bestowed upon the coronavirus Wednesday.

“Everyone usually gets [Trump] where he needs to be within a couple of days,” one official said. “The problem is we don’t have a couple of days.”

Kushner only recently became involved with the administration’s virus response, beginning to attend meetings in his capacity as a senior adviser, according to officials, but inserted himself more fully as he became increasingly convinced that more tangible action was needed. He supported Trump’s decision to ban most travel from Europe for 30 days and has pushed for further concrete steps, some of which are expected to be announced in the coming days, officials said.

There was some frustration among other White House aides at the sudden involvement by Kushner, who they viewed as simply parachuting in and whose vast portfolio — including Middle East peace negotiations, immigration and the reelection campaign — has been the subject of mockery in some circles.

The travel ban has been criticized by some experts for being largely ineffectual at this point considering the virus already has spread throughout the United States, as well as the fact that Trump exempted the United Kingdom, meaning anyone trying to fly to America from Europe could simply get to London first.

Tom Bossert, Trump’s former homeland security adviser, was sharply critical of the measure, saying it would have been helpful earlier but now the key focus should be on community mitigation, such as closing schools or quarantining sick individuals.

“There’s little value to European travel restrictions,” Bossert tweeted Thursday morning. “Poor use of time & energy.”

On NBC’s “Today” show Thursday morning, host Savannah Guthrie read Pence — who is overseeing the administration’s coronavirus response — a snippet of a Trump tweet in which the president accused “the Fake News Media and their partner, the Democrat Party” of trying to “inflame the CoronaVirus situation.”

“There’s been some irresponsible rhetoric,” the vice president told Guthrie, before going on to praise Trump for his concern for the health and well-being of the American public.

It was initially unclear if Pence was perhaps criticizing his boss for the president’s own “irresponsible rhetoric.” But when asked, an aide to the vice president quickly insisted that he was not."

1. Yes, the novel coronavirus is ""just a bad flu."" Being run over by a truck is just ""a bad fender bender."" It's 30-100x more deadly. The endemic flu changes a little every year, and because your immune system has seen something similar before, it can fight it off. The nCoV is a common cold (1/5 of common colds are normal endemic coronavirus, but this one is much different from endemic) with a mutated alien laser arm. A normal pokeball isn't gonna contain it. Time to upgrade to ultraballs.

2. No, it's not SARS1 or MERS either. People died of those before they were able to go to March Madness to lick everyone on the face. I think we've realized this now. Apparently we haven't played Pandemic enough.

Great game. GG HF KA KEKEKE

3. From the public health standpoint, the US government taking the ""my adjacent neighbor's house is burning down but I'm safe because my house is newer and I have Alexa"" strategy didn't work, did it? We have the best healthcare system in the world when it comes to rare disease, but our public health readiness is abysmal. We're getting calls in the ER from people all day asking to be tested. We're telling them no. Not because we don't want to, but because we can't. The real numbers are much higher. We have our blindfolds on and are calmly saying ""Alexa, tell me if my neighbors are on fire.""

4. People are freaking out proportionally. It's too late to say ""here's what we know, here's what we don't know, here's how to be prepared. We are going to take precautions and here are the next steps."" Instead, we went straight from ""it's not gonna affect us, it's just a common cold"" to ""SHUT DOWN ALL THE FLIGHTS AND PUBLIC EVENTS."" We're buying all the toilet paper not because we think it's going to kill SARS2, but because of uncertainty of future quarantine status and uncertainty of supply. (See prior post about bidets for winning strategies)

5. What does this means for each one of us individually? Simple. Wash your hands, cover your face, stop eating ass, be prepared. There's no need to build a bunker, but being completely cavalier is not the right response. This virus likely isn't going to kill you, but why increase your chances and exposure to those around you?

\*edit: there does not appear to be any evidence that eating ass spreads coronavirus"

* The first thing I'll say is that all of the cancellations and disruptions we're seeing, from flights to sporting competitions, is *good news*.

Each time something like this is announced, the worst case scenario in terms of infections and deaths is looking slightly better.

’The government's strategy seems to be to try to ensure the UK population acquires ""herd immunity"" to the virus. Now for ""herd immunity"" to work, that means somewhere between 80%-90% of the population have to be immune. This means they are planning for 80%-90% of us to get it, because the only way to become immune to covid-19 is to have had it and survived.

Of course, many of us will not survive it. On the current mortality rate of about 3%, that means 1,657,500 of us will die. The government's ""delay"" strategy seems aimed at trying to ensure we do not all get it at once.

It is worth asking just what sort of government can calmly contemplate the deaths of over a million and a half of its citizens. They really do not care about us at all. Not in the least. There will be the very best of care for them and their chums among the Entitled Classes; isolation under very comfortable conditions, round-the-clock support from doctors who are not harrassed with an impossible caseload and are thus able to give them their full attention and support, the very best of supportive care, etc. There will be no shortage of vital equipment like ventilators for them.

The rest of us? We can go hang. We can pull through it and live, or we can drop dead. This government really does not give a damn. As Johnson has said: ""many more people will lose loved ones to coronavirus"". This is his plan. He actually intends that many more people should lose loved ones to coronavirus.

The sad thing is we had the chance to elect a government led by a man who actually cares about people. We rejected it decisively and went off seeking the fools' gold of brexit. (52 of the 54 seats Labour lost were in leave-voting constituencies). They got slaughtered at the polls. Now we have, as a nation, chosen to put ourselves in the hands of a government that is happy to see us get slaughtered too, by the million. We cannot say we do not richly deserve our fate.’"

Prions scare me 1000x worse. We're not even sure if they're alive. At least with viruses there's some sense of reproduction and a lifecycle, even if they are ""robotic"" in a sense. 

A prion is just a protein that folded the wrong way so it wrecks your cellular machinery. The proteins that the prion touches, which fold the right way, then flip around and fold the wrong way. It's like if you have a bunch of mousetraps that are laid on the floor and one trips, then that trips two more, which trip four more, and so on. 

It's just a protein strand so there's nothing to kill, like how soaps break down lipid barriers in coronavirus or bacteria. Your immune system can't fight it because your immune system is looking for particles, like bacteria or viruses. 

You have to ""kill"" prions by something like heat, which destroys the physical protein structure so it's not folded the wrong way anymore (or folded at all). There's no treatment for you once you're infected with prions, because there's nothing to kill without destroying the other proteins in your body. We're not even sure if they break down in the environment like how viruses break down after a day or two on hard surfaces. 

They're like self-replicating acid or radiation that attacks you at a subcellular level. It's terrifying.

No one is going to risk their career over something most people compare to the flu (yeah, yeah, coronavirus fanatics argue that it's nothing like the flu but quite frankly, nobody who matters, cares).

Since he has no granted authority to close the university, blaming it on him instead of the province is just putting pressure on the wrong people, and the people addressing petitions to him really need to get it straight."

From an expert AMA, science editor at National Geographic 
""You could expect additional travel bans and large-scale quarantines, which would likely lead to mass migrations of people who do not want to get stuck behind the restrictions. Those mass movements could work against the effectiveness of infection control strategies. In the long-term, if the virus spreads widely, we might expect governments to move away from quarantine methods and divert resources primarily toward medical treatment."""

Also I wouldn’t bank too heavily on the “all young people will be fine” thing because young healthy people HAVE died of COVID19. Not everybody under 30 is entirely safe.

So I guess the school would have to judge between keeping everyone on campus and willingly allowing the dorms to become Diamond Princess or shutting everything down. From an epidemiological perspective it would be better to lock them all down on campus but that only works if everywhere else is doing the same thing."

""The system does not — is not really geared to what we need right now — what you are asking for. That is a failing. It is a failing. Let’s admit it,” Fauci told lawmakers.

According to the article (the Washington examiner is a conservative publication) the US has tested only 9,000 for Coronavirus.

This is inexcusable. South Korea has tested over 220,000 people. Italy has tested over 70,000.

The American Enterprise Institute estimates the US has the capacity to test 20,695 people a day. In a country of over 300,000,000. The Senate physician has estimated that tens perhaps even hundreds of millions of people may become infected with Coronavirus. 

Videos of the Coronavirus were online in early January. Yet 3 months later the US government doesn't have the proper testing capacity??? 

It's like we're living in a third world country.

People will die because of this incompetence."

A relative of mine works in a bank. The bank manager, **who is sick and had just returned from the USA**, walks in the front door and hangs out in the bank for an hour, chatting to people.

Worst part -- the bank manager wasn't even meant to be at work that day. She just decided to pop in and say hi **while sick**. She got herself tested for coronavirus the next day. Not sure on results yet.

The stupidity of some people..."
