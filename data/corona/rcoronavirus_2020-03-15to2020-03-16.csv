* China tactic when the house is burning: First jail the guy who shouted ""fire"" and ignore, then build a fire department in 20 minutes next to the burning house and take out the fire.

* USA tactic when the house is burning: Call the fire and the smoke ""fake news"", sit in the burning house and consult with McDonalds and Intel on creating a website for the purchase of smoke detectors.

* German tactic when the house is burning: Do nothing for 2 months, then let each room member decide his/her own measures - so nothing is coordinated and nothing is synced.

* Italian tactic when the house is burning: Everything is on fire, everyone is burning - call the fire department for help, but it is busy with preparing for its own fire. Then, receive one bucket of water from China.

* UK tatcic when the house is burning: DEFINE ""BEING ON FIRE"" as ""good"" and call it your strategy. Sit and wait and have a cup of tea."

This really goes to show that the viral load you're exposed to plays a huge role in severity. If you inhale one infectious droplet you could be fine, but if you're exposed multiple times your body can't keep fighting. Just like with mr. Wenliang, and Urboni with SARS. 

It's important that people work with their communities to minimize spread. One infectious person in a grocery store might lead to a few people with mild infections, but if you raise that number, the people infected and the severity could rise exponentially...

Make your own masks out of old clothes, layers, eye protection, learn proper sanitary procedure all around but especially for donning and doffing your gear...

“A lot of us think that despite everything we do, we will probably be exposed,” said Dr. William Jaquis, the chair of the group. Still, he said, “The first reported case certainly sends a shock wave through the community.”

Emergency rooms represent a busy intake point for hospitals, where patients come in with symptoms but no diagnosis. As the coronavirus spreads during the typical flu season, emergency physicians are triaging large numbers of patients around the country with symptoms that could be the virus.
“As compared to anyone else at a hospital, you are operating with the most incomplete information,” said Dr. Angela Fusaro, an emergency doctor in Atlanta.

Tomorrow I will be working with my boss to get sign off from our board of directors to develop an app. This app will be a food/supply donation and delivery app. People who wish to donate food/supplies will sign up with their address, and those who are in need will likewise sign up. Our hospital will be repurposing some healthcare workers and other vetted/tested community members to be delivery drivers. Essentially, each user account associated with an address will be able to request meals and/or supplies, and the app will generate deliveries based on the available supplies offered in donation. The donations will come from local food banks, restaurants, and individuals. 

I wanted to see if you could publicize this, I would love to share this app with other communities around the world. I believe this app will serve three vital functions 1) provide food and services to those in need without increasing risk of spreading the infection 2) increase camaraderie and lift the general spirit of the community 3) able to be reused in future crises, and perhaps even in every day life for those in need but unable to travel 

Feel free to reach out to me via DM for more information or if you wish to aid in the development of the app.

EDIT: FYI this app will be fully open source and free. No ads no profits whatsoever. The app will be extremely lightweight with a rapid turnaround time. The only front-load data requirement will be a de-identified listing of all residential addresses within a given county."

2020-03-15,mwsol94,Coronavirus,10,https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/fj1m3e/daily_discussion_post_march_15_questions_images/fkld01l/,"Okay this is going to be a long post and will probably get buried, but gotta get it out and maybe it will help someone out there.

I am an ICU RN in a large metro area in the midwest USA (>2 mil population). What I'm about to type is not true for every region or hospital, but I assume it is what is happening in most hospitals right now or over the last week and a half in the US. Our specific facility has not been hit hard (yet), only 3 patients were being ruled out in my unit when i last worked (Friday), but are not critical (I cared for one). We have a plan in place to handle the suspected increase in patients as this goes on. Most hospitals probably have plans in place to be ready to handle increased patient load. We have also implemented very strict visitation for loved ones limiting it to only a single person for the duration of the patients stay.

In the US system, the ER is going to be hit the hardest initially because too many people are going to be coming in with a cough or sore throat and no other symptoms, which in turn puts them in contact with countless other people who probably have more significant illness/injuries happening increasing their risk of severe illness. This also slows the system down.

If you have mild symptoms that are like a cold or flu. Stay home and manage it like you would a flu (rest, hydration and fever (>100.6 degrees F) management. Wash your hands and isolate yourself as best you can for the full 14 days. Call your primary MD if you are still concerned.

Only call 911 or come to the hospital if you are having severe symptoms such as shortness of breath, chest pain, intractable nausea and vomiting etc. ( [https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/symptoms-testing/symptoms.html](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/symptoms-testing/symptoms.html))

While testing is important to monitor the spread and better identify people who need to stay isolated it doesn't change anything in the management of the illness. Testing is unfortunately slow here. Hospitals in my area of the country were only testing the potential severe cases or high risk patients due to the slow turnaround on tests (in my area) and limited availability at this time (again in my area). When testing centers start opening soon (I hope), by all means go get tested there because hopefully there will be limited contact with people and you'll know if you need to isolate for the full 2 weeks and we can use that data to monitor this after the pandemic is over.

Why this is serious.

This is a time of year (in my area anyway) where hospitals are busy and often have limited beds as is, so even a 5-10% increase in bed need (especially in ICU where different training is required to safely care for severely ill people) can put a strain on the system. That is the real danger of this illness, not the illness itself (for most people).

The measures in place are not an overreaction due to how easily the virus seems to spread. 1 person at a sports event comes into contact or close proximity to 100's. They are in place to slow down the volume of patients entering the healthcare system at once. We are trying to avoid Italy's situation where a lot of people became seriously ill at once causing a significant crisis and increased mortality. They were kind of a perfect storm, but responded amazingly by locking down.

The data on this pandemic can be misleading because it is still happening and constantly changing. Like all things with humans, illness is heavily dependent on so many factors. Data is also easily manipulated and can be skewed to push any personal agenda. China is the best statistical data to look at for the general run of the illness because it started there and was reacted to as a new disease and even that mortality rate will be high because they didn't know what they were dealing with for a time.. But again too many factors effect it because air quality, age general health of population etc. impact the number of severe illnesses/deaths blah blah blah.

Anyway, stop the panic, the media did a pretty good job initially, but now are back to fear mongering and pushing agendas and creating panic. Continue to practice social distancing, isolate if ill, avoid elderly or at-risk people. Wash your hands and quit buying all the goddamned toilet paper.

Good news is that I am on a 5 day stretch off work and haven't received a single call for help from the hospital yet, so going to enjoy it while it lasts.

Throwaway account because everyone has something to say. Much love and respect to my fellow nurses and MD's dealing with, and about to deal with the progression of this, especially in Italy. Stay safe out there.

If anyone is interested I will try to update in a week if I am able to leave the hospital."

2020-03-15,Wynardtage,Coronavirus,9,https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/fj62ul/us_government_is_rolling_back_protection_for/fkl3nze/,"The Trump administration has been working to relax regulations governing America’s nursing homes, including rules meant to curb deadly infections among elderly residents.

The main federal regulator overseeing nursing homes proposed the rule changes last summer, before the coronavirus pandemic highlighted the vulnerability of nursing homes to fast-spreading diseases. The push followed a spate of lobbying and campaign contributions by people in the nursing-home industry, according to public records and interviews.

The coronavirus has killed 13 residents at a nursing home in Washington State; dozens more residents and employees there have fallen ill. Seeking to prevent further contagion, some states, including New York, have banned most nonmedical personnel from setting foot inside nursing homes and other long-term care facilities, which nationally have about 2.5 million residents.

Last July, the federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, or C.M.S., set in motion a plan to weaken rules imposed by the Obama administration that required every nursing home to employ at least one specialist in preventing infections. The proposed rules — which the agency is completing and has the power to enact — eliminate the requirement to have even a part-time infection specialist on staff. Instead, the Trump administration would require that anti-infection specialists spend “sufficient time at the facility.”

Critics say the proposed requirement is so vague that it would be essentially meaningless — and dangerous.

“It adds up to less time, less infection control,” said Anthony Chicotel, a staff lawyer for California Advocates for Nursing Home Reform. He said the proposed change was “alarming.”

Attorneys general in 17 states have called the proposed rules a threat to “the mental and physical security of some of the most vulnerable residents of our states.”

The White House referred questions to the Medicare and Medicaid agency. In an interview on Saturday, the agency’s administrator, Seema Verma, said the proposed rule changes were not about easing up on nursing homes but “about not micromanaging the process.” The proposed changes to the infection-prevention rules, she said, could actually result in a “higher level of staffing.”

“We have to make sure that our regulations are not so burdensome that they hurt the industry,” she said.

Ms. Verma emphasized that the rules were still in the proposal stage and not yet complete. “We have to make sure that we get it right for the sake of patients,” she said.

Infection-prevention specialists are supposed to ensure that employees at nursing homes properly wash their hands and follow other safety protocols. They are widely considered the front line for stopping infections, among the leading causes of deaths in nursing homes.

Each year, about 380,000 residents are killed by infections, according to the Medicare agency. Failure to prevent them is also the leading cause of citations that state inspectors bring against nursing homes.

The coronavirus has laid bare such problems, most starkly at the Life Care Center of Kirkland, Wash., where 13 residents have died after being infected with the virus, and more than a third of the facility’s roughly 180 employees have contracted the illness.

The Kirkland facility, which scored a top quality rating of five stars from the federal government, has had problems before. In April 2019, the Medicare agency wrote it up for failing to “consistently implement an effective infection control program.” In its report, the agency described the concerns of a resident’s daughter, who said that nurses allowed her mother’s heel, which had an open wound, to touch the ground, calling the practice “unhygienic.” The agency found that the facility’s shortcomings put residents “at risk for harm and transmitting/acquiring infections.” The agency, which levied a $67,000 fine, said the problems were quickly fixed.

In recent weeks, nursing home operators nationwide have been cracking down on visitors. Ronald Silva, whose company manages two dozen nursing homes in Indiana and Georgia, said his facilities began screening all workers and vendors three weeks ago.

The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services provided new guidance for nursing homes this month, telling inspectors to scrutinize whether employees were following key safety precautions, like regularly washing their hands. Vice President Mike Pence echoed that guidance, emphasizing that all federal inspectors should focus, at least for now, on making sure that facilities are working to prevent and control infections.

“We’re going to put all inspection resources, at the state level, focused on infectious disease, looking at nursing homes being a focal point of vulnerability and a vulnerable population,” Mr. Pence said at a press briefing on March 3.

Mr. Pence did not mention the Trump administration’s proposals to relax the Obama-era rules. The proposed changes are part of a broader effort by the Trump administration to unfetter businesses from regulations. In the case of nursing homes, relaxed regulations are projected to save the industry about $640 million a year, according to estimates from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid.

In its first year, the Trump administration changed how nursing homes were fined when they violated rules. Previously, they were typically penalized for every day in which a violation persisted. But the agency changed the guidance for inspectors, encouraging them to hand out a single fine — rather than a series of daily penalties — for most infractions. Under the Trump administration, the average fine imposed on a nursing home has dropped more than 30 percent from $41,260 to $28,405, according to an analysis of federal data by Kaiser Health News.

Ms. Verma said the changes to how nursing homes are fined were meant to increase consistency across the industry.

The agency also weakened a rule that would have made it easier for nursing home residents and their families to sue over claims of elder abuse, sexual harassment and wrongful death.

“Together these changes gut enforcement,” said Toby Edelman, a senior lawyer at the Center for Medicare Advocacy, a nonprofit legal assistance group for the elderly. “They are a gift to the industry.”

The administration’s moves came after intense lobbying by the nursing home industry, including by the firm run by Brian Ballard, Mr. Trump’s friend and a fund-raiser. Parlaying his personal connections to Mr. Trump, Mr. Ballard has become one of the most powerful lobbyists in Washington, with the most clients of any registered lobbyist last year, according to an analysis by the Center for Responsive Politics. His firm has lobbied on behalf of nursing homes in his home state, Florida, for years, according to public records. (He was also a lobbyist for Mr. Trump’s Florida golf course, the Doral.)

After Mr. Trump was elected, Mr. Ballard was retained by a leading trade group for the nursing home industry, the American Health Care Association. His firm, Ballard Partners, has earned $930,000 in lobbying fees from the group since Mr. Trump took office, records show.

Ms. Verma, who emphasized that she didn’t even know Mr. Ballard, said she didn’t like to hear from lobbyists. “I tell folks I am not going to meet with D.C. insiders,” she said. “I want to meet with people on the front lines.”

A spokeswoman for the nursing home trade group said that loosening the requirement to have an infections specialist on staff would allow facilities to “provide greater flexibility to meet” to thwart infections.

In November, Mr. Trump was honored by a group of nursing home operators at a fund-raising event at a packed ballroom at the InterContinental hotel in Midtown Manhattan. The event drummed up more than $3 million for his re-election campaign through a political action committee called America First Action.

Flanked by two American flags onstage, Mr. Trump singled out one of the executives, Eliezer Scheiner, who donated $750,000, the most of any attendee.

“I want to thank Eli Scheiner for doing such an incredible job,” Mr. Trump said.

Mr. Scheiner, who owns 22 nursing homes across the country, received a round of applause.

Mr. Scheiner’s nursing homes have received subpar ratings from federal regulators. Since 2017, they have been cited more than 40 times for slipshod infection control. In 2018, inspectors at one of Mr. Scheiner’s nursing homes in Balch Springs, Texas, spotted a staff member who failed to wash or sanitize her hands before cleaning a resident’s anal area. During the same inspection, another staff member was written up for allowing a resident’s feeding tube to touch the inside of a bathroom trash can.

Two years ago, Mr. Scheiner was accused of fraud by a federally appointed bankruptcy court trustee in Connecticut. The trustee accused Mr. Scheiner and his partner of transferring more than $1 million of assets out of one of their nursing home companies into other entities they controlled, a few months before the nursing home company filed for bankruptcy.

Mr. Scheiner didn’t respond to requests for comment. He and the bankruptcy trustee agreed to a settlement this year.

In addition to no longer requiring nursing homes to designate at least one part-time “infection preventionist,” the Trump administration also has proposed adjusting a requirement that facilities must assess what they might need for patient care, from staffing levels to medical equipment. Under the proposal, facilities would have to do such assessments every two years instead of every year."

It's her first job. She is in the high risk group, and my mom who lives with us is over 70 and on oxygen. McDonald's doesn't want to ""scare"" customers so won't let her wear a mask at work to prevent her from getting the virus and bringing it home and killing her Nana. Two days ago I told her she quits. Screw that. I'm not losing a child and mother because McDonald's refuses to protect their workers. And if they aren't protecting their workers they sure as hell aren't protecting their customers. A White Castle and another fast food joint shut down two days ago because a worker had the virus. So, no, eating at these places is seriously UNSAFE! If you have an addiction to fast food, now is the time to cure it. Every time you get something you risk getting a side of coronavirus. If everyone stops eating there then maybe they will get the idea that safety is an issue! Or they'll go broke and shut down. It isn't safe. Just don't."

Typically we informally define a depression as the point where fiscal policy no longer has an effect on the economy.

As of Saturday afternoon, there were 642 confirmed cases and 40 deaths in Washington state.

Pointing to the way the coronavirus has spread in other countries, Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease, said that the US can still expect more cases and deaths, primarily among older and vulnerable people.

""We have not yet reached our peak,"" Fauci said at a White House briefing Saturday.

As of Sunday morning, there were at least 3,010 coronavirus cases in 49 states, Puerto Rico, the US Virgin Islands and Washington DC. At least 61 people have died. West Virginia remained the only state without any confirmed cases.

With the threat of further spread on the horizon, officials across the country have imposed a slew restrictions to curb the spread of the virus. Local governments have encouraged residents to stay home and practice social distancing. Some states, including California, New York and Washington state have banned large gatherings.

Schools across the country have closed, worship services have been canceled and recreational and entertainment events are at a near-halt, bringing dramatic changes to the everyday lives of Americans.

And the restrictions and closures keep coming.

Hoboken, New Jersey, announced a citywide curfew starting Monday. Residents will be required to stay in their homes from 10 p.m. to 5 a.m., with exceptions for work, Mayor Ravinder Bhalla said.

Bars and restaurants in Hoboken won't be allowed to serve food inside their locations as of Sunday at 11 a.m. They ""will be permitted to conduct food takeout and food delivery service only,"" Bhalla said.

In Colorado, Gov. Jared Polis issued an executive order Saturday requiring downhill ski resorts close for a week due to the presence of coronavirus in the mountain communities with limited care capacity.

Polis said he was directing ""downhill ski resorts to suspend operations for one week to slow the spread of COVID-19 and conserve medical resources in our mountain communities.""

The governor said officials will continue to monitor the course of the outbreak and may amend the executive order.

And Los Angeles County will temporarily suspend all jury trials through March 30, according to a source and an internal police memo obtained by CNN. Los Angeles Police Department spokesman Josh Rubenstein confirmed the contents of the memo to CNN.

The hiatus would include the murder trial of multi-millionaire Robert Durst, pending a final approval from the judge presiding over his case.

""The courts will re-examine the suspension decision continuance prior to March 30th,"" the police memo states. ""Personnel will be resubpoenaed through the courts for new jury trial dates."""

Mission Statement:

The purpose of this document is to build a **scalable, community-driven framework** for community organization of basic aid delivery to self-isolating persons in a **safety-driven method,** such that efforts to aid isolated persons minimizes the risk of inadvertent transmission. The principle is simple: 

**Today you, tomorrow me.**

ReSPONsE asks that healthy individuals, with reduced risk and financial burden, assist those who are at the greatest risk of harm from COVID-19. And, in doing so, help build a network that will save many lives by flattening the curve.

The reason for such a framework is to minimize the burden of self-isolation, both to directly aid those in isolation, and to mitigate the prospect of additional spread by encouraging individuals to stay home."

I've been through several hurricanes and it just feels like waiting for shit to hit the fan.

My husband works for the courts. He still reports to work, but there are no trials, hearings... anything for the next 30 days...

Which then bleeds into my job -- I work in a domestic violence shelter which also has an outreach program for protective orders and assistance as well as a sexual assault crisis center.

It would be a logistical nightmare to shut us down. I work in the shelter proper and we have a room set aside if we have to quarantine any clients. If we shut down, our clients who are literally hiding from their abuser, would be put in danger. We could run a skeleton staff and wear masks... but we do so much for/out in the community.

Those protective orders I mentioned... some expire in the next 30 days. And there is no court to do any hearings to keep them in place. 

I am rambling... but the shelter is a petri dish. One sickness goes around and everyone gets it. Right now we have several elderly women, immunocompromised women, and small children in shelter. I worry about them getting it more than me.

So far we have had two confirmed cases in our community."

I mean honestly, it's just a matter of time.

I'm not really concerned about myself when I do get it - I'm a fairly healthy 31 year old guy. But it sort of feels like my efforts to avoid the virus are ultimately going to be fruitless. I'm convinced one way or another that I will get it at some point. It's just a matter of when.
