1) It seems so far at least to be significantly more infectious.

2) Swine flu for better or for worse targeted younger people, who could battle it significantly better than old people (or infants). COVID-19 seems at least so far to be a disease that kills the elderly en masse, since they can't effectively fight it (especially with comorbidities). This makes it much more deadly.

3) Even in non-fatal cases, it seems to require hospitalization too frequently versus swine flu. This puts the whole medical system at risk due to much more demand vs. supply, meaning that it increases the fatality rate for **all** medical conditions during peak times.

4) It seems doctors and healthcare providers are at increased risk, and have died even young with no comorbidities."

2020-03-21,CapableObligation,Coronavirus,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/fmfa26/daily_discussion_post_march_21_questions_images/fl53k4o/," Ok, let's talk numbers and compare Covid-19 to H1N1 - the last global pandemic. Let's do an apples to apples comparison.

This is not the flu or as benign as most lay-people think

The CDC estimates that during the 2009 to 2010 US H1N1 flu pandemic from there were:  
60.1 Million cases (19.44% of the population - rough 1 in 5)  
274,000 cases required hospitalization (.045% of all cases)  
12,469 deaths  
The mortality rate was 0.02%

in contrast, as of today, COVID-19 exposure in the US is at:  
24,150 confirmed cases.  
Approximately 10% of the cases require hospitalizations with ventilator support. (I have no hard numbers to support this and it's based on anecdotal estimates in NYC and Seattle)  
285 people have died as a result of their exposure.  
The mortality rate in the US is currently 1.18%

Based on pure numbers Covid-19 is 56.8 times more deadly than H1N1.

Taking data we have from the last pandemic, If 60.1 million people were to contract Covid-19 we are looking at 709,254 deaths. Scaled against the number from 2009 - 2010 It would still outpace Heart Disease as the leading cause of death in the US by 61,000 in 2020.

But before you breathe a sigh of relief - It gets worse!

When you consider that 10% might need ventilators and only between 160K-170K ventilators are available in the US... That number gets much higher.

Now let's compare the number from the 2009-2010 H1N1 to Covid-19 worldwide morality rates and from hot spots like China, Italy, and Spain.

Worldwide (4.27% mortality) = 2,567,105 deaths in the US.  
China (3.98% mortality) = 2,392,634 deaths in the US.  
Italy (8.57% mortality) = 5,153,510 deaths in the US.  
Spain (5.31% mortality) =3,197,167 death in the US.

We're talking about a lot of dead people, most likely someone you know.

During the H1N1 Pandemic, medical professionals had one significant advantage in curtailing the spread of H1N1. H1N1 had a vaccine, rapid testing, and it responded well to antiviral medications

WE HAVE NONE OF THOSE THINGS RIGHT NOW!

Potentially Millions of Lives are at stake.

THIS IS WHY WE HAVE TO WASH OUR HANDS, STAY HOME, AND CLOSE BUSINESS TO PREVENT SECONDARY SPEAD UNTIL A VACCINE IS CREATED.

We've been told that we're all in this together, yet if you have symptoms you're suppose to shelter at home for 3-4 days, then call your doctor to ask what you should do.

This makes little or no sense, because strict public health measures would mean that we want to find out quickly who's infected and who isn't so that we can find and isolate any infected contacts.

These basic public health measures aren't being implemented, which places more people at risk.

The reason why these measures aren't being implemented is because testing has been a problem and our public healthcare workers are under staffed for this level of engagement.

So rather than fix this problem, we've fallen back to rely on hospital support for those most severely infected, which causes additional problems for the infected and uninfected including our hospital workers.

So now everyone is scrambling to shore up the medical care system, which they know will be quickly overwhelmed with cases.

All this seems short sited, if we could hire the appropriate level of public healthcare workers to find, isolate and contain the infected while checking their previous contacts over the past two weeks.

It's hard to understand why we've essentially abandoned these public healthcare measures that have served us so well in the past.

Now we have a mess of conflicting policies that won't do much to prevent the spread, but will probably flatten the curve a little and keep the infections going longer and ruin our economy.

That's the end of my little rant. I hope you enjoyed it and perhaps learned a little bit more how public health care measures are the best way to go."

I work for a southern grocery company, and this last week had been the busiest we have ever seen. We are all tired, frustrated, and scared. People yell at us for not having what they came there for, and explaining that there is a shortage doesn’t resonate with a lot of people. They don’t care. People are invading my personal space, touching me when I try to keep a distance, and treating us worse than usual. 
I have specific stories, but it’s all kind of a blur. People walk in with face masks and gloves, and then want to say “don’t you wish you were home instead of working here? Aren’t you scared of getting sick?”
Of course I am. I have told people for weeks that this is going to be a large problem, but they thought I was crazy. 
Today, my mom was talking to me about work. She said how her boyfriends ex wife didn’t want him or his children coming into contact with my sister or I. Why? Because “she knows what we do for work.” My sister was working In a restaurant before they switched to just take out. 
You would think, by the way my mom said it, that we were in the business of murdering people or running an illegal underground business. That we were doing something that she didn’t approve of. 
Whoever is reading this, if it even gets anywhere, please treat your grocers with kindness. We are getting a lot more bad apples than we are good ones. We are trying our hardest, and we are giving you all we have. We want to stay healthy too, for ourselves and the people we go home to at night. We know that our jobs are extremely important right now, but so is social distancing, so PLEASE don’t go out unless you absolutely need to. I don’t want myself (who sees many people a day and can only wash my hands and sanitize since I can’t really wear gloves or a mask) to spread it to anyone who is just trying to buy their groceries, to my grandparents, or to my mother, who has lung issues.

The top White House official responsible for leading the U.S. response in the event of a deadly pandemic has left the administration, and the global health security team he oversaw has been disbanded under a reorganization by national security adviser John Bolton.

The abrupt departure of Rear Adm. Timothy Ziemer from the National Security Council means no senior administration official is now focused solely on global health security. Ziemer’s departure, along with the breakup of his team, comes at a time when many experts say the country is [already underprepared ](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/to-your-health/wp/2018/04/27/bill-gates-calls-on-u-s-to-lead-fight-against-a-pandemic-that-could-kill-millions/?utm_term=.e861b54cdaeb&tid=lk_inline_manual_3&itid=lk_inline_manual_3)for the increasing risks of a [pandemic](https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/health-science/the-trump-administration-is-ill-prepared-for-a-global-pandemic/2017/04/08/59605bc6-1a49-11e7-9887-1a5314b56a08_story.html?utm_term=.6b7fb71a6b57&tid=lk_inline_manual_3&itid=lk_inline_manual_3) or bioterrorism attack.

Ziemer’s last day was Tuesday, the same day a[ new Ebola outbreak](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/africa/congo-health-ministry-confirms-2-cases-of-ebola/2018/05/08/41429d30-52db-11e8-a6d4-ca1d035642ce_story.html?utm_term=.cf7c1f804be3&tid=lk_inline_manual_4&itid=lk_inline_manual_4) was declared in Congo. He is not being replaced.

Pandemic preparedness and [global health security](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/to-your-health/wp/2018/02/01/cdc-to-cut-by-80-percent-efforts-to-prevent-global-disease-outbreak/?utm_term=.99e90744bb7c&tid=lk_inline_manual_6&itid=lk_inline_manual_6) are issues that require government-wide responses, experts say, as well as the leadership of a high-ranking official within the White House who is assigned only this role.

“Health security is very fragmented, with many different agencies,” said J. Stephen Morrison, senior vice president at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. “It means coordination and direction from the White House is terribly important. ”

The personnel changes, which Morrison and others characterize as a downgrading of global health security, are part of Bolton’s previously announced plans to streamline the NSC. Two members of Ziemer's team have been merged into a unit in charge of weapons of mass destruction, and another official's position is now part of a unit responsible for international organizations. White House homeland security adviser [Tom Bossert](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/white-house-homeland-security-adviser-resigns-amid-continued-turnover-in-trump-administration/2018/04/10/15db518a-3ccb-11e8-a7d1-e4efec6389f0_story.html?utm_term=.2d2315c28d3a&tid=lk_inline_manual_9&itid=lk_inline_manual_9), who had called for a comprehensive biodefense strategy against pandemics and biological attacks, is out completely. He left the day after Bolton took over last month.

NSC spokesman Robert Palladino said Wednesday the administration “remains committed to global health, global health security and biodefense, and will continue to address these issues with the same resolve under the new structure.”

Another administration official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to discuss the issue publicly, acknowledged it was only one of many administration priorities. “In a world of limited resources, you have to pick and choose,” he said. “We lost a little bit of the leadership, but the expertise remains.”

Ziemer is a well-respected public health leader who was considered highly effective leading the President’s Malaria Initiative under George W. Bush and Barack Obama before joining the NSC last year. While Palladino said he left “on the warmest terms,” an individual familiar with the specifics behind the reorganization said “he was basically pushed out. He struggled to preserve himself and the integrity of his team, and he failed.”

His exit comes against the backdrop of other administration actions critics say have weakened health security preparedness, including dwindling financing for early preventive action against infectious disease threats abroad.

The new Ebola outbreak is in northwest Congo. Only two cases have been confirmed, but the World Health Organization reported Thursday another 30 probable and suspected cases of the deadly hemorrhagic fever. Of those, 18 already have died.

Congolese and international health officials say they hope to control the outbreak quickly, but some health officials worry about its potential to become more serious and spread because of its location in a town upriver from the densely populated capital of Kinshasa.

This week, the administration released a [list of $15 billion in spending cuts](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/trump-calls-on-congress-to-pull-back-15-billion-in-spending-including-on-childrens-health-insurance-program/2018/05/07/9427de18-5216-11e8-a551-5b648abe29ef_story.html?utm_term=.d3d190c66a9e&tid=lk_inline_manual_21&itid=lk_inline_manual_21) it wants Congress to approve. Among the targets is $252 million in unused funds remaining from the 2014-2015 Ebola epidemic in West Africa that killed more than 11,000 people, far exceeding the combined total cases reported in about 20 previous outbreaks since the 1970s.

The White House proposal “is threatening to claw back funding whose precise purpose is to help the United States be able to respond quickly in the event of a crisis,” said Carolyn Reynolds, a vice president at PATH, a global health technology nonprofit.

Collectively, warns Jeremy Konyndyk, who led foreign disaster assistance at the U.S. Agency for International Development during the Obama administration, “What this all adds up to is a potentially really concerning rollback of progress on U.S. health security preparedness.”

“It seems to actively unlearn the lessons we learned through very hard experience over the last 15 years,” said Konyndyk, now a senior policy fellow at the Center for Global Development. “These moves make us materially less safe. It’s inexplicable.”

The day before news of Ziemer’s exit became public, one of the officials on his team, Luciana Borio, director of medical and biodefense preparedness at the NSC, spoke at a symposium at Emory University to mark the 100th anniversary of the [1918 influenza pandemic](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/retropolis/wp/2018/01/27/the-flu-can-kill-tens-of-millions-of-people-in-1918-thats-exactly-what-it-did/?utm_term=.2cf86c8371cb&tid=lk_inline_manual_27&itid=lk_inline_manual_27). That event killed an estimated 50 million to 100 million people worldwide.

“The threat of pandemic flu is the number one health security concern,” she told the audience. “Are we ready to respond? I fear the answer is no.”"

Public health people are tough on tobacco and even worse on vaping. Everywhere we have data, fewer smokers are infected with this than non-smokers relative to the share of each in the population. Nobody wants to know why this is because they don't want to encourage people to smoke. Instead they focus on what seems intuitively obvious: when smokers do get it, it's worse.

No data one way or the other on vaping, to my knowledge. And keep in mind CDC identified black market THC vape cartridges as a public health menace and *still* refuses to acknowledge that nicotine vaping was never implicated."

So long as R0 is above 1, the virus will rip through the entire population, and in the process rake up economic loses.

We need to reduce R0 to below 1, far below 1, so the transmission gets cut, the curve dont just flatten, it dies, this saves lives, and by ending the outbreak quicker, also money.

All the current half assed measures still result in an R0 above 1, arguable the worst outcome for both lives and economy. Everything need to lock down, not just office workers, but everything, control every point of contact, to break the chain completely.

Also it is common now to hear that the media and vocal people raising alarms about the virus caused the financial collapse. 

I am a retired firefighter, so I am going to use a fire department analogy here. 

A person (China) does something accidentally that starts a fire in their house. They don’t call anyone and try to put it out themselves. Finally the fire gets too big. 

Neighbors (WHO) see that some embers from the fire are starting to blow on to a house next door. Those neighbors warn the owners of that other house (USA) and call the fire department dispatcher (Trump) saying that a tiny fire has just started in the new house.

The dispatcher says, “it is just a tiny fire, don’t worry it will burn itself out” and does not dispatch the fire department. 

Only after repeated further calls from the neighbors and from the owners of the house and also from the local news reporter who is now on scene watching the fire spread to the rest of the neighbor’s house does the dispatcher finally dispatch the fire department. It is too late, though. 

The fire has spread through the entire second house. There is still time to save some of the contents of that second home, but much less can be saved now than had the fire department come when the fire was still small. 

When questioned about it, the dispatcher says, “I knew all along from the beginning that the fire was going to catch the rest of the neighbor’s house on fire. I was just trying to keep the people calm in the bank next door to the neighbor’s house because the lights and siren on the fire truck would have worried them.”

A portion of the bank ended up catching on fire as well because the fire in the second house was not adequately dealt with. 

Now yes. You can say that the person whose house first caught on fire was the first person responsible for the fire. But you can’t say that the dispatcher who did not do their job was not responsible for the second house having a worse emergency than it could have. 

And blaming the neighbors and the news folks for constantly calling the fire dispatcher asking them to do something is silly too. Finally, thinking a correct response to an emergency would spook the people in the bank any more than the actual smoke from the fire itself is unrealistic as well. 

The people in the bank were going to evacuate regardless of whether they heard the fire truck or the people watching the fire. They were going to leave because of the fire itself. Certainly from the fire in the building right next door, but likely they would have evacuated from only the first fire as well. And now they will have to stay evacuated even longer because of the extra damage to the bank due to a lengthened response. 

The residents of that second house had two choices and neither were good. They could evacuate (Social Distance) leaving them homeless for a while (hurting financially.) 

Or they could stay in the burning house (business as usual) hoping the fire wouldn’t make it to the room they were in before help arrived risking themselves or a family member being burned.

In either case the residents were going to need outside help. They would need the Red Cross (Congress with Trump) right away for immediate help with being temporarily homeless. 

And they would need emergency services (scientists, doctors, safety equipment, hospitals, vaccine researchers, infrastructure) to put out the fire so everyone can go home and back to work. 

It would be a different home. And it would take a while to build. Nothing in it would be quite the same, but it would be a place to feel safe again, eventually."

>Pro  Publica March 17. As of 2018, Greenville, SC had 2,220 total  hospital  beds, of which about 64% were occupied, potentially leaving  only 800  beds open for additional patients. The bed count includes 280  beds in  intensive care units, according to data from the American  Hospital  Association and the American Hospital Directory. Intensive care  units  are best equipped to handle the most acute coronavirus cases.  
The  Greenville, SC region has a population of about 961,000 residents;  16%  are over the age of 65. The experience in other countries has shown   that elderly patients have significantly higher hospitalization and   fatality rates from the coronavirus.  
In  the moderate scenario, in which 40% of the adult population contracts   the disease over 12 months, Greenville, SC would be among the regions   that would need to expand capacity.  
It  is estimated that about 8% of the adult population would require   hospital care. In a moderate scenario where 40% of the population is   infected over a 12-month period, hospitals in Greenville, SC would   receive an estimated 62,300 coronavirus patients. The influx of patients   would require 2,080 beds over 12 months, which is 2.6 times the   available beds in that time period. The Harvard researchers' scenarios   assume that each coronavirus patient will require 12 days of hospital   care on average, based on data from China.  
In  the Greenville, SC region, intensive care units would be especially   overwhelmed and require additional capacity. Without coronavirus   patients, there are only 41 available beds on average in intensive care   units, which is 11 times less than what is needed to care for all  severe  cases.  
For the analysis,  Jha and his team selected various rates of infection  and modeled  hospital capacity for each over three time periods, six  months, 12  months and 18 months. The infection rate scenarios are based  on  estimates from leading epidemiologist Dr. Marc Lipsitch, head of the   Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health’s Center for Communicable   Disease Dynamics, who made the projections of how many people globally   would be infected.  
By modeling the  data over the three time periods, the scenarios  illustrate how much  the nation could “flatten the curve” with social  measures to ensure  hospitals have greater capacity to care for  coronavirus patients.  
“The  way to permanently stop new cases from setting off long chains of   transmission is to have each case infect considerably less than one case   on average,” Lipsitch said. “The numbers will go down. There will  still  be little outbreaks, but not big ones.” ""

It's a great idea - but I'm not sure if I trust the material used and I'm wondering what we could line this with to use as a filter. The cotton mask alone would do little for protection (unless used to cover an N95 mask to help it last longer). 

I sent an email to the CDC to see if the could help, but there's no telling how many calls and emails they're getting right now. I'll try to call them if I don't receive an email soon.

If you have any ideas or suggestions - please reply!"

Not to mention you wrecking because you are racing or doing something dumb is taking up another hospital bed and putting you in the hospital and making us go in there to see you. Also had our department tell us that they don’t want us wearing gloves or masks in the hospitals when talking to victims of wrecks or when we pull over people because that’s just going to create more panic.

>Trump signed the measure after several people urged him to act amid mounting concerns over a supplies shortage, a person familiar told CNN. But as he signed the emergency bill earlier this week, the administration had yet to conduct a full account of inventory across the nation, nor had it identified which companies it would need to make which products. That still hadn't been done as of Friday night, this person said, despite Trump insisting the act would be used to acquire ""millions of masks."""

For a flu we have a vaccine, so Sick and old people take the shot and don't get sick, also we have some immunity to the flu, yet the flu is able to infect billions of people and kill the 0.1%  of a relatively healthy population (people who choose not to vaccinate)

Now for this new virus we have no vaccine and nobody is immune, so old and sick people take it and occupy ICU beds and it's very likely they die. Then all the rest of the population takes it and gets infected way more than with the flu because of no previous immunity, this leads us to the hospital be overwhelmed leading to an increased death rate.

While there is no significant data per se, there are countries like Korea and Japan that have culture of their citizens wearing masks, even prior to this pandemic. These countries have not been pursuing aggressive lockdown like China, and yet their data has been encouraging. Japan hasn't even been pursuing testing aggressively like Korea.  


The supply shortage of masks is assumed due to the need to use disposable mask daily. But what if each American can wear one mask? Surely, with news that China is producing 100 million masks daily and with different companies increasing production, this can be done. When done along with social distancing, especially if every American were to wear one in public, one would think that it may at least help in preventing asymptomatic patients from coughing to other patients, along with preventing people from touching their faces. Also, culturally, when everyone wears a mask in public, it signifies that everyone is committed.  


For instance, what if each citizen owned two cotton masks and one surgeon mask that can fit inside a cotton mask? The cotton masks can be washed with soap and rotated between use. We are talking about putting in 1 trillion dollars to give universal income and making thousands of new ventilators. Giving one mask to 300 million American would be much more affordable solution that may help flatten the curve.  


Not trying to go against CDC or anything. Just was wondering if this idea made sense to other posters. There are a lot of states like Montana that are still relatively early in infection, and any public health measure, such as this, may help, especially knowing that the fight against coronavirus may take months. You can't go on lockdown forever.

The government's decision is to close all production activities in the whole national territory that are not strictly necessary, crucial, indispensable to guarantee essential goods and services"". These are the words of the Prime Minister, Giuseppe Conte."

Anyone putting profit over safety does not deserve to be in business. Idc if it sounds cold, you brought it on yourself (example: GameStop.) 

America is failing its citizens. Trump is an utter failure and has been before this. His staff, the senate, they have no interest in the people. Anyone who even considers voting for him and those that are not supporting us, are part of the problem. We needed a lockdown weeks ago. My town, for example, has people violating social distance and indoors capacity. If they aren’t taking it seriously and being responsible adults, then a lockdown is necessary.

The alarm was raised in early January and nobody did anything.  It wasn't even buried in some secret report , it was readily available in the news.  When it was brought up the reporters were told that it wasn't a big deal.  Once it became a big enough deal that they had to do something it was painfully obvious that absolutely no prep work happened in the background.  When the president was asked about his responsibility in all of this he said ""I don't take responsibility"".  All of this was happening while other members of government, who knew what was about to happen, cashed out their securities for a payday.

Motherfuckers got rich off of killing citizens.  I want every single person to remember this.  If this same behavior happened in another country we'd all be talking about how the citizens should rise up against the corrupt governemnt.  Our politicians were busy making money and prioritized that over saving lives.  I'd like a refund of my taxes over the past 3 years because it's apparent that no services were ever going to be rendered and we all got ripped off.

Now I am 100% blind and sometimes find myself navigating outside the house.

Most of the time, Antonia (my girlfriend) is helping me around.

I have to hold on to somebody's hand when I need help in unfamilliar places such as stores or sidewalks.

How do we maintain social distancing while still allowing people to assist blind people like myself who need help getting around?

note, Antonia does not like me holding her elbow, she always gets me to hold on to her hand.

Antonia gets me to hold on to her right hand, and if she needs to touch other things she uses her left hand.  She is also strict about hand washing which is good too, but her and I were discussing this and I thought I'd ask what you guys recommend for me when I go out places, such as to help with grocery shopping?

I don't want to make Antonia do all that stuff because I always help her out like a good boyfriend should.

Recommendations guys?

thanks.

PS I live in Canada, in Manitoba, but I don't live in Winnipeg."

It's awful to shame people for trying to keep things as normal as possible, or wanting to see their loved ones. It's an incredibly difficult thing to ask of people to self isolate for weeks and weeks - if I was in California I'd probably truly have a mental breakdown or sneak outside at night.

An analysis of all COVID-19 patient profile studies filed in China from December 2019 to February 2020 suggests that men account for roughly 60% of those who are infected and become sick. And in a detailed accounting of 44,600 cases in mainland China as of Feb. 11, China’s Center for Disease Control reported that the fatality rate among men with confirmed coronavirus infections was roughly 65% higher than it was among women.


In South Korea, men accounted for nearly 62% of all cases. And infected men were 89% more likely to die than were women.”
