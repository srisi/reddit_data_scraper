You get a cold, you get over it. You get one again months later. Antibodies against it don’t last for long

With coronaviruses it is even worse, as immunity and antibodies does make it even way worse when you catch it again. It is called antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) of viral entry, there was some quite recent and serious academical science study on such phenomenon:

> ADE has been observed for coronaviruses. Several studies have shown that sera induced by SARS-CoV spike enhance viral entry into Fc-receptor-expressing cells. Further, one study demonstrated that unlike receptor-dependent viral entry, sera dependent SARS-CoV entry does not go through the endosome pathway.
> Additionally, it has long been known that immunization of cats with feline coronavirus spike leads to worsened future infection due to the induction of infection-enhancing antibodies. However, detailed molecular mechanisms for ADE of coronavirus entry are still unknown.

> The above tweet reads: “Starting today, as a countermeasure to the coronavirus, \[this restaurant\] is Japanese only. I have a responsibility to protect my family, my staff and Sanji junkies. Please understand that this is not discrimination.”
> 
> On Twitter, people replied in Japanese that this was in fact discrimination and even hate speech. Others pointed out that viruses don’t pay attention to nationality.
> 
> Considering that Japan has [the third most cases](https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/) in the world of the virus, with Japanese nationals infected with coronavirus, Ueno Sanji’s proclamation seems especially odd.

WHO also said that - with a mortality rate of around two percent, COVID-19 was ""less deadly"" than other Coronaviruses such as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome or Middle East Respiratory Syndrome.
WHO officials rejected the suggestion that all cruises should be halted to avoid risking a new nest of infection like the one on the coronavirus-hit Diamond Princess off Japan.

The coronavirus epidemic in China has raised concerns over a slowdown in the global economy, but agricultural commodities such as wheat, corn, and cattle are unlikely to suffer, and may get a boost when coronavirus worries ease analysts say.

“There will be no real demand destruction in agriculture from the coronavirus,” says Sal Gilbertie, president and chief investment officer at Teucrium Trading. “People still need to eat, which means agriculture demand will not abate.”

The coronavirus “lethargy” in grain and meat prices could provide investors with a chance to gain access to agricultural commodities prior to any Chinese buying that will occur from the U.S.-China phase-one trade agreement, he says.

Corn futures CK20, -0.59%  fell by more than 2% while wheat WK20, -0.76%   was little changed, andSK20, -0.31%  lost nearly 7% this year through Thursday. Lean hog prices LHJ20, -0.15%   declined by over 6%, with live cattle futures LCJ20, -1.59%   losing more than 5%. Cotton CTK20, -1.05%, meanwhile, trade 0.4% higher so far this year.

The rising coronavirus infection count and death tolls have had a “bearish emotional impact” on commodity prices that are most sensitive to Chinese demand, including soybeans, says Todd Hultman, lead analyst at commodity market information and analysis provider DTN.

Commodities have all reacted differently to the new coronavirus, with haven gold GCJ20, +1.72%  on the rise as oil CLJ20, -0.69%  declines on the back of expectations for lower energy demand.

In the agricultural market, lean hogs were “hit the hardest” by the coronavirus, says Craig Turner, senior commodities broker with Daniels Trading.

When phase one of the trade deal went into effect on Jan. 15, “we were expecting China to buy large amounts of pork starting on Jan. 25,” he says.

The coronavirus, however, “was gaining steam in the press in late January, and when the market started to worry about the virus,” hog prices came down, he says.

Turner believes that soybeans, beef, pork, and cotton are the “most at risk” from the virus in the short term because those are products that China buys from the U.S. Cotton, in particular, is linked to textiles and manufacturing, not food or animal feed.

Still, Hultman points out that “if and when the disease concerns stabilize, we may actually find that the Chinese government will need to make more food purchases to help cities where quarantines depleted local supplies.”

In the meantime, there have been concerns that China may not meet its trade deal obligation to purchase $36.5 billion of U.S. agricultural commodities this year and $43.5 billion in 2021, says Dan Cekander, president of grain-market service DC Analysis, adding that he believes the coronavirus has delayed Chinese buying under the trade pact.

Cekander expects China to comply with the agreement terms, but if the coronavirus remains headline news until the summer, there is “increased risk” of China asking for a reduction in its 2020 purchase obligations.

Those obligations were already “very challenging,” says Darwei Kung, head of commodities and portfolio manager at global asset manager DWS Group.

With the coronavirus, it is more likely that China would delay the implementation while the government focuses on using its resources to fight the spread of the disease, Kung says. The implementation may “only resume post-resolution’’ of the epidemic, he says.

However, the impact of the virus on food consumption is much less than that on energy consumption, says Kung.

“While people in China have traveled less or delayed factory reopenings, aggregate food consumption is less likely to be deferred or delayed,” he says."

But allowing the status quo to continue, with 1/4 of US companies experiencing IP theft *every year* from China, with such a large trade deficit, and them manipulating currency to pummel American competition into the ground unfairly was a much more dangerous route.

In one year, the trade deficit was lowered [by 18%](https://www.thebalance.com/u-s-china-trade-deficit-causes-effects-and-solutions-3306277). We have China agreeing to [not require US companies to share IP in order to do business](https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2017/08/14/china-must-stop-forcing-us-firms-share-intellectual-property-peter-navarro-column/563151001/) which was the major reason for all of the theft.

All that being said, I would agree that general morality seems to be falling and that there is this feeling that under the surface we're teetering over a precipice, but things like that are not predictable on when the disaster/breakdown/war actually happens, or even if the collapse comes at all.

Initially it was negative in tests carried out at the **Sacco hospital in Milan** . But the Istituto Superiore di Sanità has confirmed that man has fallen ill, albeit in a lighter form. Normally the 28-year-old manager spends most of the year in **China** , with limited periods in Italy. He **returned from China between January 20 and 21** , but he has always been well (and still is healthy), except February 10, when he had mild flu symptoms. Immediately there had been doubts.

The ""patient 1"" is, instead, **a 38-year** \- **old man from** Codogno, also infected **his wife, who is hospitalized at the Sacco hospital in Milan** , and four other people residing in the same area, hospitalized with a clinical picture of pneumonia.About three hundred people under examination, including **close colleagues, doctors and nurses** from the Codogno hospital who helped him. In the last two weeks, the 38-year-old has had a very wide social activity: for example, he has participated in a running competition and a soccer match. 150 ""close contacts"" will be buffered, plus 160 Unilever employees, who have been asked not to leave the offices pending the test.

The Codogno emergency room is currently closed and **all patients** who were present in the same hours as the 38 year old **have already been contacted** . The experts from the ATS of Milan and the Department of Health led by **Giulio Gallera**are reconstructing, through what are called ""interviews"", all the contacts that man has had in the last period. The Department of Health, after the nightly summit, works incessantly to carry out all the necessary checks and protect public health."

A total of 100 new cases were confirmed by the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC), 85 of them connected to the Shincheonji Church of Jesus in the southern city of Daegu. 
The mayor of Daegu - South Korea's fourth-biggest city, with a population of over 2.5 million - has advised locals to stay indoors, while access to a major US military base in the area has been restricted.

People were out and about on the streets Friday, with most wearing masks, but many businesses were closed due to the outbreak.

The KCDC said one more virus case had been confirmed at a hospital in Cheongdo county near Daegu where a total of 16 infections have now been identified, including a long-stay patient who died Wednesday after showing symptoms of pneumonia.
Cheongdo is the birthplace of Shincheonji's founder Lee, and county officials said a three-day funeral was held for his brother three weeks ago at a hall owned by the hospital.

President Moon Jae-in called for a ""thorough investigation"" of everyone who attended the funeral and Shincheonji services. 
""If you simply rely on the information provided by the church, the process can be slow,"" he told a cabinet meeting. ""We need faster measures.""

Lee Yoo-jin, 73, who runs a dress shop in the city centre, told AFP: ""I have not had a single customer this week. I have run the shop for over 20 years and never have I seen such a drop.""

Residents expressed frustration, with a passer-by at the church saying authorities should have closed a nearby subway station for cleaning.
""Now it's all over the place,"" said the woman, surnamed Kim. ""It's too late now.""

The central government on Friday declared Daegu and Cheongdo ""special management zones"", with Prime Minister Chung Sye-kyun saying the region would be supported with medical personnel, beds and equipment and the cabinet will meet three times a week to discuss the outbreak.
Authorities in Seoul banned public rallies at three main locations on health and safety grounds.

The US army garrison in Daegu - where around 10,000 soldiers, civilians and family members live or work - has restricted access and instructed any American troops who recently attended Shincheonji services to self-quarantine.

""Travel in and around Daegu is highly discouraged unless absolutely necessary,"" the garrison said Thursday in a Facebook post. 
""Please avoid public places and public transportation, to include stores, restaurants, subways and other heavily congested areas.""
Shincheonji has closed all its facilities nationwide.

""We are deeply sorry that because of one of our members, who thought of her condition as a cold because she had not travelled abroad, led to many in our church being infected and thereby caused concern to the local community,"" it said in a statement.
The new coronavirus started in the Chinese city of Wuhan but has since spread to more than 25 countries."

Zhan Qingyuan, head of infectious diseases at the China-Japan Friendship Hospital, said in a press briefing on Friday that people who had already had the virus would have developed antibodies but should remain on alert so they did not get ill again.

“The antibodies may not remain for a long time, so there is still a risk that these recovered patients will be infected again,” Zhan said. “They should continue to keep themselves protected.”""

Thirteen of the infections were diagnosed in travelers who fell ill after returning from overseas, and 21 in people “repatriated” by the State Department.

More infections are expected among the people who were passengers aboard the Diamond Princess cruise ship and are in quarantine, Dr. Nancy Messonnier, director of the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, said at a news briefing.

Because they may have been in contact with infected people on the ship, “they are considered at high risk for infection,” Dr. Messonnier said.

At least 634 passengers and crew aboard the Diamond Princess have tested positive for infection with the coronavirus.

Ten other passengers from the Diamond Princess tested positive in Japan, but are not being counted among the infected yet, because the tests have not been confirmed by the C.D.C. They will likely be added to the case count, Dr. Messonnier said.

Several Americans remain critically ill with the infection in Japanese hospitals. They were among the passengers aboard the Diamond Princess, which was overwhelmed with infections after it docked in Yokahama, Japan.

As of Friday, the coronavirus has infected at least 75,000 people, the vast majority in mainland China, and has killed 2,240.

“This new virus represents a tremendous public health threat,” Dr. Messonnier said.

2020-02-21,Fra_Bernardo,ukpolitics,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/ukpolitics/comments/f7g3pv/superforecasters_have_bright_future_predicts/fib1wg0/,"Dominic Cummings has had a bad few weeks. After advertising for “weirdos and misfits” to shake up Downing Street, the first weirdo employed — a “superforecaster” — proved a bit too weird.

There had been his comments about race and IQ, preventing an “underclass” through mass contraception and — as journalists trawled deeper into Andrew Sabisky’s internet history — the brief foray into sex advice centred on the virtues of submissive wives.

And now, following the young special adviser’s inevitable resignation, reporters were at Mr Cummings’s house asking him about his employment policy. Was it all going well? His response? “Read Philip Tetlock's *Superforecasters*, instead of political pundits who don't know what they're talking about.”

A few days and hundreds of inquiries later and Tetlock, a Canadian academic, has been forced to draft a standard response to copy and paste into emails to journalist.

He is happy about the attention, and pleased people are interested in his work, but “it would be unfortunate”, he wrote, “if superforecasting came to be linked in the public mind with a political point of view”..

Indeed his life’s work, the promotion of a method for making better political and geopolitical forecasts, is ideology neutral — and, he says, definitely not to be associated with race science. “Contrary to recent rumours in UK,” he says, “there’s no sinister Nietzschean *Übermenschen* agenda.”

It has been, then, a busy week for Tetlock — not to mention a fraught one, as is any week in which you are forced to distance yourself from belief in a master race. Although, he says speaking to *The Times,* he was not as surprised as you might think to find himself invoked on the Islington doorstep of a Downing Street overlord.

In fact, he says, this is not even the first time a government official has referenced his research. Remember when Michael Gove said that “people in this country have had enough of experts”? That, he thinks, was him too.

Tetlock is best known for one fact. Over a decade ago he analysed 30,000 predictions made by hundreds of experts from television, print and radio — the “pundits” Cummings was referring to. His conclusion? Their accuracy is, quite literally, “no better than a chimp with a dartboard”.

Worse, the more eminent the expert the worse their results. The people we rely on to make predictions about the future are, in general, very bad at it indeed.

Tetlock is not only familiar with the case of Mr Sabisky. He is arguably the reason he was employed at all. Because if the first half of Tetlock’s career was about showing how bad most predictions are, the second was about making them better. Sabisky is the product of that and — forays into eugenics aside — Tetlock thinks Downing Street needs more people like him, rather than fewer.

“Whether you’re Tory or Labour, whether you’re Democrat or Republican, whatever your party affiliation and whatever modern democracy we’re talking about,” he says, “you should prefer that leaders are receiving predictions that are as accurate as possible.”

To do so, he argues, you need to employ the services — and methods — of superforecasters.

A “superforecaster” is not a title people give themselves. It is, like the science that created it, a precisely-defined concept. After learning that most experts are bad at predictions, Tetlock went on a hunt to find those who aren’t. Working with the US intelligence services, a series of global tournaments was launched, in which people — experts, pundits, schoolteachers, binmen — made predictions.

They answered questions including: “Will there be a London Bridge-scale terror attack in a European capital city in the next three months?” and “How many total cases of Wuhan coronavirus will have been reported by the World Health Organisation as of 20 March 2020?”

These are precise questions, to which clear answers are required. They are not afflicted by the curse of prediction that Tetlock identifies as “vague verbiage forecasting”, where assessments come in a form where it would be “very difficult after the outcome is known to assess who is closer to be right”.

When an expert, for instance, says Britain is going to “get Brexit done, and make a success of it”, it is difficult to see — barring utter catastrophe or an unprecedented boom — how the word “success” can ever be contradicted or affirmed. This kind of statement is perhaps defensible in politics. It should not be so, argues Tetlock, in political or intelligence advice.

“You have experts making claims along the lines of, ‘there's a distinct possibility that the Iranian nuclear programme will successfully produce an atomic bomb by the end of 2021’,” he says. “What does ‘distinct possibility’ mean in that context? It could mean anything between roughly 20 to 80 per cent, depending on whether you're focused on ‘distinct’ or ‘possibility’.”

This matters. “The semantic elasticity of the forecast protects the forecaster from falsification, and that slows down the learning process and makes it much harder, for both experts and the people who consume expertise, to evaluate who was closer to the truth on what.”

Worse, he suspects the sensible analyst might even deliberately skew their answers. “As a reasonably career-savvy analyst there are two mistakes here. You could underestimate the likelihood of getting a bomb or overestimate.”

You could be wrong, in other words, because Tel Aviv gets nuked and you thought it wouldn’t, or wrong because nothing happens and you suggested it might. “Which mistake would be worse for my career? That is the calculus that goes on inside every organisation all the time and that's a problem with the traditional civil service model.”

In the forecasting tournaments, that is not possible. When people make an assessment, they have to put a number to it. Then, their accuracy is judged. And when it was, of all the thousands of entrants, Sabisky fell in the top 2 per cent and within a category termed “superforecasters”. Then, he was employed by Mr Cummings to advise on defence, on questions such as whether Iran would get a bomb.

Superforecasters are all different, but they also share traits. To do well in the tournaments you can have an ideology but Tetlock, who works at the University of Pennsylvania, has found you must put it aside when assessing facts. You must be aware of, and avoid, common cognitive biases.

For instance, in the wake of a London Bridge terror attack you might guess a higher chance of another happening. A superforecaster would instead look at the base frequency of terror attacks going back five years and start with that. Then by reading around the subject, but not too much — most are at the level of “informed *New York Times* readers” — he or she would come up with a probability figure.

These are, says Tetlock, exactly the qualities needed in Downing Street. “The UK is in an interesting situation, post Brexit. There's a lot of pressure on the leadership to be resourceful. So I think it's understandable they should want to look to improve the quality of the decision-making process. I can't help but admire government officials who show an interest in rethinking how probability estimates flow into the policy process.”

Eventually, he says, this idea of using probabilities and keeping score will not seem niche nor even controversial — but obvious. Then, a century or so in the future, with the “crushing condescension of history” we will look back on the way we made decisions in 2020 with the scorn we reserve today for the Salem witch trials.

So, in the main, he is pleased that earlier this week the government’s chief adviser took time out while stepping past his wheelie bin to recommend his book. Although he adds, given what prompted it: “I would probably have rathered I had come up in a different context.”"

I'm doing a bit better, thanks :) I had the totally bland, non-superbug version of the coronavirus before I caught the flu, so it's not been the greatest start to the year.

>
>The Demon's Daughter is not a bad place to start. Of the two, it's Pingali Surana's lighter work. It's basically a bollywood melodrama--soppy romance and all. If you ever wondered why bollywood movies are the way they are, it turns out it goes back a long ways, haha.

I've been reading/watching some really heavy stuff on the Ottoman Empire, so something lighter sounds good.

I never knew that about Bollywood, interesting! I'm really into TV dramas but not a big fan of movies, so most of my Bollywood knowledge comes from [videos like this](https://youtu.be/evG2M1QpRbc). I'm from the US, but I really like historical dramas from other countries, I mostly watch Chinese and European dramas, with the occasional Turkish melodrama in there (Magnificent Century is my guiltiest pleasure lol). I've never seen anything from India, though I've got a couple of Netflix originals on my watchlist — is there anything that you would recommend? I've heard most shows are soap operas but that there are some really good dramas based on classic literature and historical events. 
>
>
>Yeah, people outside India don't realize that India as a single country is pretty recent. That's not to say that Indian culture is a modern construct, the ""idea of India"" ie of a coherent South Asian cultural identity is very ancient. But it was more like Europe, where you have Germany, France, Italy, etc that are distinct from each other but have a shared history and cultural identity.

Yeah, like I knew there wasn't a single language/culture that encompassed all of India, but I still had a very simplistic idea of how these cultures interacted with each other. Thanks for the information on Telugu history/culture. :)

>I should mention though that I would not recommend reading these texts in their original version--almost no Indian does this. These texts are very archaic, very long, and very difficult to approach, pretty much only scholars read the original versions (in sanskrit or in translation). I would recommend relying on a good retelling--this is how Indians come to read these texts.

I'm so glad to know retellings aren't considered cheating lol. I've tried audio books and different translations, but they weren't exactly relaxing entertainment — I thought it was because I was ignorant of the context/just uncultured. :p  I've really enjoyed the retellings I've heard though. Thanks so much for the recommendations, looking forward to checking them out!"

Good conditions sure, like cold temperature on a sleek surface. I have not read anything about chance of infection from non host sources, I do not know if any research has been done into that. The novel coronavirus can be excreted, a man in Hong Kong got infected that way. Someone in an apartment a couple of levels up from him had it, and he caught it as well without coming into contact. The apartment building had shared sewage. This in and of itself is not as bad as it seems, when people have proper hygiene.

> ADE has been observed for coronaviruses. Several studies have shown that sera induced by SARS-CoV spike enhance viral entry into Fc-receptor-expressing cells. Further, one study demonstrated that unlike receptor-dependent viral entry, sera dependent SARS-CoV entry does not go through the endosome pathway.
> Additionally, it has long been known that **immunization of cats with feline coronavirus spike leads to worsened future infection due to the induction of infection-enhancing antibodies**. However, detailed molecular mechanisms for ADE of coronavirus entry are still unknown.

What it might mean in practice:

> 
> It’s highly possible to get infected a second time,” one of the doctors, who declined to be identified, told the outlet.
> 
> The physician said that medication used to treat the virus can have negative side effects on patients’ heart tissue, making them more susceptible to cardiac arrest.
> 
> “A few people recovered from the first time by their own immune system, but the meds [sic] they use are damaging their heart tissue, and **when they get it the second time, the antibody doesn’t help but makes it worse**, and they die a sudden death from heart failure,” the doctor said.

Take current numbers with a grain of salt, but 15-20% is the current estimate for required hospitalizations (see link at bottom.) I expect this would devastate the US economy if this situation spreads here, which is increasingly likely. How many individuals would go bankrupt due to time off of work and medical bills? How many companies would preemptively stay closed? How many insurance companies would go bankrupt over medical bills? How many mortgages and car loans would go unpaid? How many small business could afford the reduction in workforce + consumer base while this plays out? Economic impacts could still be severe even if the disruption only lasts for months. 

I don't have confident predictions, but the market seems to continue to ignore that these numbers could be high. I don't even think the market is really pricing in reduced earnings from reduction of chinese consumers and supply chains, let alone this possible chain of events in the west.

Flu (influenza A in particular) is incredibly difficult to make a vaccine against because it has a segmented genome and broad host range which allows different strains to swap genome segments if a cell is coinfected. This is how you get crazy pandemics because suddenly since some guy was infected with bird flu and human flu you end up with a flu strain that is now 50% bird flu and 50% human flu.

Coronaviruses on the other hand have a single genome segment thus no chance for recombination like flu. 

If we spent the decades of research trying to make a vaccine against coronavirues we would have a great one. Heck we already have a decently promising coronavirus vaccine within a few months of this outbreak."

When virologists and medical experts around the globe discussed the suspicious nature of the novel coronavirus and pointed to Wuhan’s P4 lab as a likely source, netizens inside China were watching. A Chinese scholar recently challenged Wuhan’s P4 lab to explain how the proteins of the novel coronavirus seem to have been precisely engineered to enable the virus to bind onto human cells. He also disclosed unethical and unprofessional practices he previously observed in China’s bioresearch labs.

According to Wuhan-based Yangtze Daily, Shi Zhengli, Deputy Director of Wuhan’s P4 Lab, publicized a statement on Feb. 2 saying: “I pledge with my life that the 2019 novel coronavirus has nothing to do with our lab. This virus is a punishment imposed on mankind from nature, to condemn mankind’s uncivilized way of living. Those of you who believe rumors or so-called scientific analysis by unqualified researchers, I advise you to shut your damn mouths!”

Shi’s statement irritated many Chinese netizens. “For such a huge calamity that may take countless lives, give us facts and evidence, not pretentious statements such as pledging with your life,” one netizen commented.

A social media user named **Wu Xiaohua, with a Ph.D. in biological related fields** according to his WeChat profile, challenged Shi to answer key questions about the suspicious gene mutations found in the new virus.

Wu pointed out there is no way that these mutations are the outcome of natural recombination.

“Now, many scientists, including Shi herself, believe that this virus must have originated from bats, and would involve one or two virus hosts to explain the gene mutations. Based on current scientific publications, the virus must jump from rats to primates before it can infect humans. Then how is this step—from rats to primates—usually achieved? It can only be done in a research lab by scientists inserting a certain protein from primates into rats,” Wu wrote.

“I have personally performed the same type of genetic engineering experiments. You cannot get away by being cavalier. Do you dare to accept the challenge and give us an explanation?” he asked.

**Wu also disclosed that some biolabs in China are very poorly regulated.**


“For instance, **some researchers in these labs kept the laboratory dogs as pets; some disposed of animal carcasses casually because following the biosafety rules and cremating them costs a lot of money. Some cut up the laboratory pigs and took the meat home to eat.** I know this happened at Beijing 301 Hospital’s spine surgery lab. Worst of all, some laboratory animals were sold to wet markets as wild-caught animals for profit,” he wrote.

Xu Bo, a well-known IT magnate and billionaire in China, cited reports and articles to support Wu’s statements.

In his blog, Xu cited a news report about a lawsuit against biologist Li Ning.

Li is an academician of China Engineering Academy, and a former professor at China Agricultural University. The judgment in Li’s case, which came out on Jan. 2 this year, stated that between 2008 and 2012, **Li’s lab sold experimental pigs, cows, and milk to local markets**. These animal and animal products were bought using research funds; but Li and his fellow colleagues pocketed the money, a total of 10,179,201 yuan ($1,460,304), from the sale of these animals and animal products.

**Li was sentenced to 12 years in prison for embezzlement.**

According to a 2016 report from the China Experimental Animal Information Network, Chinese researchers use tens of millions of laboratory animals every year. The Experimental Animal Research Center of Hubei Province alone handles about 300,000 animals a year, either for bioresearch experiments inside the center, or to be sold and distributed to other labs in Hubei Province.

Xu and many other Chinese netizens say they suspect that the novel coronavirus is a genetically engineered virus that somehow escaped from Wuhan P4 Biosafety lab.

A P4 lab handles level 4 biosafety pathogens, the highest level and most dangerous, which have high fatality rates and no known treatments, such as, the ebola and SARS viruses. Such a lab must follow the highest microbiological safety standards to ensure the safety of researchers and the public.

The P4 lab in Wuhan is not only the first of its kind in China, but also the first in Asia. When it opened in 2017, U.S. scientists expressed concerns that, considering China’s opaque administrative structure, if one of those killer viruses “escaped” from the lab, it could cause a doomsday disaster.

In America a lot of the encounters seem to build up to a violent outburst of racist tension; a white teenager says the N-word towards a group of black men and it becomes violent or a Hispanic woman at a Walmart is being racially vilified and the tension builds.

In Australia it's generally quite accepted that there is an appropriated level of racism, the amount of Coronavirus jokes relating to Asians from my friends has been disconcerting but they don't see the problem with it. My uncle who lives in the NT will talk about Aboriginals as if they are pests and says some downright shocking things about them as well as calls them derogatory names yet he doesn't consider himself racist. 

There is this thing here called ""Tall Poppy Syndrome"" which means allegedly we treat each other as equals and resent people with superiority complexes but to me it's a total joke because people with wealth here have severe resentment of the poor and vice versa. The same goes for racism, you might see a lot of people blaming poor immigrants for taking jobs that the majority of Australian citizen will not choose to do willingly (e.g nursing, cleaning etc) but then they never blame the politicians elected by them who make it their goal to increase a foreign workforce. So racism is a lot more permeable in Australian society; we tend to blur the lines between stereotypes as well. Like it has become normalised to the extent we have such high immigrant rates that it's okay for any Australian to crack racist jokes at their expense. 

In the cities it has changed lately and a lot of obvious racist behaviour has been quashed, but the majority of Australians (especially in the outback) will say things that would not fly in other western countries. In the UK and the USA it's a lot more ""hush hush"" or behind doors but in Australia it's out in the open for everyone to hear, politically though is a whole different story and that's where a lot of racists find their time to come out and speak openly."

So far vaccines trials against coronaviruses did not work at all, just made matters worse.  It is called antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) of viral entry, there was some quite recent and serious academical science study on such phenomenon:

> ADE has been observed for coronaviruses. Several studies have shown that sera induced by SARS-CoV spike enhance viral entry into Fc-receptor-expressing cells. Further, one study demonstrated that unlike receptor-dependent viral entry, sera dependent SARS-CoV entry does not go through the endosome pathway.
> Additionally, it has long been known that **immunization of cats with feline coronavirus spike leads to worsened future infection due to the induction of infection-enhancing antibodies**. However, detailed molecular mechanisms for ADE of coronavirus entry are still unknown.

Even more so if you are in close proximity or work on customer's systems.ticularly in white collar jobs where remote work is feasible.

Because, factually, they are not correct.  There is a period with all virus's where there is an incubation period where the individual is contagious and not showing symptoms.  To blame someone for 'getting them sick,' because they were showing signs shows ignorance and a lack of poor hygiene by one or both.

> We have plenty of memos issued at my workplace that have gone around as  of late reminding people of best practices (in light of Coronavirus).   Wash your hands, use hand sanitizer, cough into your arm, stay at home  if you’re unwell, etc. 

Proper hygeine in a workplace, and especially within IT is paramount.  Even more so if you are in close proximity or work on customer's systems.

> Can people transmit illness before symptoms are showing?  Yes.

Maybe because proper hygenic care will prevent/mitigate this issue and blaming someone for 'getting you sick,' just shows a pathetic little bitchy attitude.  The idea that it is 'someone elses' fault for getting you sick.

>Does  that mean someone shouldn’t take precautions once symptoms do show?  I  don’t see why not, both out of respect for others and for their own  recovery 

Different topic really.  OP is blaming their manager for 'getting them sick,' and making the false claim that if they stayed home, there is no way they would get sick.

If you have even the rudimentary understanding of disease, you know that is untrue and just a whiny little attitude."

In Washington, where it was still Sunday afternoon, a fierce debate broke out: The State Department and a top Trump administration health official wanted to forge ahead. The infected passengers had no symptoms and could be segregated on the plane in a plastic-lined enclosure. But officials at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention disagreed, contending they could still spread the virus. The CDC believed the 14 should not be flown back with uninfected passengers. 

“It was like the worst nightmare,” said a senior U.S. official involved in the decision, speaking on the condition of anonymity to describe private conversations. “Quite frankly, the alternative could have been pulling grandma out in the pouring rain, and that would have been bad, too.” 
The State Department won the argument. But unhappy CDC officials demanded to be left out of the news release that explained that infected people were being flown back to the United States — a move that would nearly double the number of known coronavirus cases in this country."

The coronavirus crisis has escalated this Friday to several levels in Italy. Fourteen people tested positive in the town of Codogno, southeast of Milan, and two others in Padua, in the Veneto region, according to the latest information. These are the first known cases of transmission by contagion of this disease in the country. This situation has led to the compulsory quarantine of about 250 people and the isolation of ten neighbouring towns with a total of about 47,500 inhabitants. In addition, the regional government has forced the closure of all public premises and has recommended that the inhabitants do not leave their homes in the next few hours. The medical alarm has also been triggered by the lack of clarity regarding the source of the infection and the epidemiological link that would allow the disease to be isolated.

&#x200B;

The first case detected was that of a 38-year-old Italian man from Castiglione d'Adda. The patient was hospitalised on Wednesday, but initially no clear connection to China was established and it was ruled out that the symptoms could be related to the disease. When his situation worsened and he had to be transferred to the intensive care unit, his wife gave the alert that activated the protocol: the man had met several times with a friend who had recently returned from China. But the clue was more puzzling.

&#x200B;

The meetings between the two occurred many more days after his return from the Asian country. More than the 14 that establish the duration of the incubation process and that could hide the symptoms. In addition, when the potential carrier of the virus was tested, he tested negative. The man remains hospitalized for further testing, but he never had any symptoms and if he actually contracted the virus, his infection could be over by now, health authorities suggested. The worst-case scenario, hence the alarm raised in the region, is that the epidemiological link would have been lost.

&#x200B;

The wife, who is eight months pregnant, was one of those who tested positive for the coronavirus, as was a man who had played sports with it. The rest of the infections did not, in principle, have direct contact with the 38-year-old man. Three customers from a bar in Codogno, the main focus of the infection in Lombardy, all arrived at the local hospital between Thursday and Friday night with significant cases of pneumonia, which made it possible to detect the positives. ""The patients are men and women, all around 40 years old. The only thing we know is that they all live in the same area,"" said Giulio Gallera, regional health coordinator. However, eight other people in Lombardy were added to the list of infections, including five doctors and three patients from the Codogno hospital where the first people to contract the virus were treated.

&#x200B;

The environment of the man who was first infected has been isolated. The patient works at an Italian branch of Unilever, while the friend who made the trip to China is a manager at MAE, an Italian producer of synthetic fibres. Among those who should be quarantined are the 38-year-old's co-workers, family members and the doctors and nurses who treated him in the hospital. The emergency room that initially treated the 38-year-old man has also been closed.

&#x200B;

The regional government has decided to close schools, administrative buildings and bars and restaurants in ten villages for one week. In addition, it has asked people not to leave their homes. ""It is necessary to immediately isolate the areas where the virus has developed in order to contain it,"" said Lombardy Civil Protection Commissioner Pietro Foroni. ""We must not spread panic, but we must make people understand that the measures taken are essential for the good of the community,"" said Lombardy President Attilio Fontana. Health Minister Roberto Speranza and the head of the National Civil Protection Agency, Angelo Borrelli, went to Lombardy this afternoon for a crisis meeting with local authorities."

Then 50% of people shout ""they did a fake practice for that! They knew it was going to happen!"" and the other 50% shout ""they had plans for this and they didn't tell us??? They're covering it all up!!!""

They're like army exercises. They provide practice for the real thing by making educated guesses on possible scenarios. And usually movie them up a bit to make them more interesting.

Here are a selection - just Google 'Emergency Planning Exercise Pandemics' and you'll find lots more.

It was reported by local media in the province that the Ministry of Health decided to prevent the entrance of Iranian citizens into Iraq until further notice.

The decision by the Maysan province, which is situated north of the port city of Basra and borders the Iranian province of Khuzestan, comes after news that two Iranians died as a result of the virus and three others have been infected by the disease in the country. As a result, the Al-Sheib border crossing was confirmed to be closed to all passengers and commerce yesterday.In the Shia holy city of Najaf, officials warned Iraqi citizens against travelling to the Iranian city of Qom, another Shia pilgrimage destination.

The coronavirus, officially called COVID-19, has swept across numerous countries in the world and gave rise to increased fears of its impact since it was first identified in China’s Wuhan province earlier this year.

According to China’s National Health Commission yesterday, 126,000 people in the country are currently under medical care on suspicions of having the virus, there are 11,864 cases which are confirmed to be infected, and the death toll there has risen to 2,120.
Though the respiratory virus has not had much of a prominent presence in the Middle East as a whole, countries in the region have implemented a series of preventative measures in order to avoid infections taking root. The measures include the UAE ordering citizens not to touch noses in their traditional greetings, and Turkey’s manufacturing of a “fast-results” kit to test for the virus."

China says outbreak hasn't peaked; Iran and South Korea see growing case numbers
Thomson Reuters · Posted: Feb 21, 2020 6:46 AM ET | Last Updated: 15 minutes ago

WHO concerned about coronavirus infections with no clear link to China
1 hour ago 2:51  
The WHO is increasingly concerned about COVID-19 outside China, especially in South Korea and Iran. 2:51
The latest: 

WHO director warns window to contain coronavirus outbreak is 'narrowing.' 
China says crisis hasn't peaked, situation in Hubei province 'remains severe and complex.'
Iran confirms 13 more cases of COVID-19 and 2 more deaths, for a total of 18 cases and 4 deaths.
South Korea declares health emergency in its 4th-largest city amid concern about new cases.
Canadian charter flight with Diamond Princess passengers who were cleared after 2-week quarantine lands at CFB Trenton, head to Cornwall, Ont., for 2nd quarantine.
B.C. health officials report 6th presumptive case in province.
WATCH: Experts are starting to identify patterns of how the coronavirus is spread.
The window of opportunity to contain wider international spread of the epidemic of the new coronavirus disease is closing, the World Health Organization warned on Friday, and countries must act fast if they are to control it.

Asked whether the outbreak is at a ""tipping point"" after new cases of infections and deaths from COVID-19 were reported in Iran and Lebanon, the WHO's director-general, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, said he still believed the virus could be contained, but noted that ""the window of opportunity is narrowing, so we need to act quickly before it closes completely.""

""This outbreak could go in any direction,"" Tedros said as he encouraged countries to keep working on containment while also stepping up measures to prepare for the possibility of more widespread transmission.

""We must not look back and regret that we failed to take advantage of the window of opportunity we have.""

The daily WHO briefing came after Chinese officials said the coronavirus outbreak there has not yet reached its peak.

""A turning point in the development of the national epidemic situation has not yet arrived,"" concluded the meeting, chaired by President Xi Jinping, according to state television.

""The epidemic prevention and control situation in Hubei province and Wuhan city remains severe and complex.""

The ruling Communist Party and the government should not relax but ""unceasingly consolidate achievements and extend combat successes,"" it said.

China has portrayed its efforts to control the virus, which has killed more than 2,200 and infected more than 75,000, as a war of containment.

Hubei revised the number of new confirmed cases of coronavirus infections upward to 631 on Friday, after including cases in the province's prison systems.

All-out efforts should be made in Beijing's epidemic control work, it said. The number of cases of coronavirus in the capital has jumped sharply while many other parts of the country beyond Hubei are reporting fewer or no new infections.

The impact of the coronavirus outbreak on China's economy is obvious, but the economy's long-term improving momentum will not change, the meeting said. Fiscal policy in China will be more proactive, monetary policy will be more flexible and the government will fend off systemic financial risks, it added.

Iran and South Korea report additional cases
Iran confirmed 13 new coronavirus cases and two deaths among the group of new cases, Health Ministry spokesperson Kianush Jahanpur said in a tweet on Friday.

The new cases comprised seven people diagnosed in Qom, four in Tehran and two in Gilan, Jahanpur said in the tweet.

The total number of cases in Iran now stands at 18, with four of those people having died.

Window of opportunity to contain coronavirus is 'narrowing,' WHO boss says 2:45
In South Korea, the government banned major rallies in its capital and declared a health emergency in its fourth-largest city as 100 new virus cases were reported Friday, bringing the country's total to 204.

Prime Minister Chung Se-kyun said in a televised statement the central government will concentrate its support to the southeastern region to ease a shortage in sickbeds, medical personnel and equipment.

""A month into the outbreak, we have entered an emergency phase,"" Chung said. ""Our efforts until now had been focused on blocking the illness from entering the country. But we will now shift the focus on preventing the illness from spreading further in local communities.""

The spike forced officials to focus on steps to contain the domestic spread of the disease, not just its entry from abroad.

Most of the new cases have been reported since Wednesday. The increase, especially in and around Daegu city in the southeast, has raised fears the outbreak is overwhelming the region's medical system. Many of the cases have been linked to a church in the city.

**First case of COVID-19 confirmed in Humboldt County**

The Humboldt County Department of Health & Human Services Public Health Branch has received confirmation from the California Department of Public Health and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) of one case of COVID-19 in a Humboldt County resident. A close contact who has symptoms is being tested as well.

This marks the first confirmed case of the novel coronavirus in Humboldt County. Presently, the ill individuals are doing well and self-isolating at home, while being monitored for symptoms by the Public Health Communicable Disease Surveillance and Control Unit.

Close contacts of these individuals will also be quarantined at home and monitored for symptoms by Public Health staff. With the amount of foreign travel by county residents, including travel to China, it is not surprising that a case has emerged locally. Additional cases may occur either in returning travelers or their close contacts.

“It’s important to remember that the risk to the general public remains low at this time,” said Humboldt County Health Officer Dr. Teresa Frankovich. “Despite the fact that Humboldt County now has a confirmed case of COVID-19, there is no evidence to suggest that novel coronavirus is circulating in the community at large.”

Frankovich added that transmission in the U.S. to date has been among close contacts and not among the general public.

Public Health suggests the following precautions to prevent the spread of COVID-19 and all infectious diseases, including common illnesses like colds and flu:

* Stay home when you are sick
* If you have a fever, stay home or go home if you are already at work or school, and stay home for at least 24 hours after you no longer have a fever (without the use of fever-reducing medicine).
* Wash your hands frequently and particularly before eating or drinking.
* Promote good hand hygiene in your home by educating household members and making sure soap, hand sanitizers, and tissues are available.
* Avoid touching your face, particularly your eyes, nose and mouth.
* Encourage proper cough etiquette. Cough or sneeze into a tissue, sleeve or arm. Do not use your hands.
* Perform routine surface cleaning, particularly for items which are frequently touched such as doorknobs, handles, remotes, keyboards and other commonly shared surfaces.

The county’s Communicable Disease Surveillance and Control Unit will continue to provide updated information about COVID-19 to health care providers, hospitals and schools, as well as the general public.

For updated information about COVID-19, please continue to check the [https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/).

If you are ill and in need of medical care and have been in China within the previous two weeks or have been in contact with an individual who has COVID-19, please contact your health care provider or emergency department before presenting for care. Arrangements will be made to have you evaluated in the safest manner possible for health care staff and other patients.

2020-02-21,williambotter,brasilnoticias,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/brasilnoticias/comments/f7hlql/sete_países_entram_na_mira_do_brasil_para_avaliar/fibc3ta/," O Ministério da Saúde decidiu alterar os critérios que devem ser usados pela rede de saúde para definição de casos de suspeita de infecção pelo [novo ](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/equilibrioesaude/2020/01/veja-o-que-se-sabe-ate-agora-sobre-o-coronavirus-chines.shtml)[coronavírus](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/equilibrioesaude/2020/01/veja-o-que-se-sabe-ate-agora-sobre-o-coronavirus-chines.shtml). 

 Até então, a definição incluía apenas os casos de pacientes que apresentavam febre e outros sintomas respiratórios, além de histórico de viagens à China em até 14 dias antes do início dos sintomas.

 A partir desta sexta (21), o ministério passará a enquadrar também nessa definição casos de pessoas com sintomas e histórico de viagens dentro desse período a outros sete países e territórios: Japão, Coreia do Sul, Coreia do Norte, Singapura, Vietnã, Tailândia e Camboja.

 A mudança ocorre devido ao [aumento de no número de novos casos fora da China ](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/equilibrioesaude/2020/01/numero-de-mortos-por-coronavirus-chines-chega-a-81.shtml)e à chegada do Carnaval, quando há maior vinda de turistas ao país. Dados da OMS (Organização Mundial da Saúde) apontam 76.769 casos confirmados do novo coronavírus no mundo até o momento. Destes, 98,4% ocorreram na China, e o restante em outros países.

 Japão, Coreia do Sul e Singapura registram maior número de casos fora da China e têm registrado aumento nos registros. Recentemente, a OMS instituiu quarentena para 9.000 pessoas na Coreia do Sul. 

 ""Esses países têm dados que nos preocupam. A partir de agora, as pessoas que apresentarem sintomas e vierem desses países [em até 14 dias antes] também devem ser consideradas como casos suspeitos"", afirma o secretário-executivo da pasta, João Gabbardo dos Reis. Os demais foram incluídos por estarem em área de risco considerado elevado para o vírus.

  Até o momento, [o Brasil não tem casos confirmados de infecção pelo novo ](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/equilibrioesaude/2020/01/veja-o-que-se-sabe-ate-agora-sobre-o-coronavirus-chines.shtml)[coronavírus](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/equilibrioesaude/2020/01/veja-o-que-se-sabe-ate-agora-sobre-o-coronavirus-chines.shtml).

 Balanço do Ministério da Saúde divulgado nesta sexta aponta apenas um caso de suspeita de covid-19 em investigação. O registro é de uma paciente do Rio de Janeiro que esteve na China, mas não foi para Wuhan, epicentro da epidemia. 

 Com a mudança na definição, a previsão é que também aumente o número de casos de suspeitos notificados pela rede de saúde. 

 A medida, porém, não altera as recomendações anteriores da pasta sobre viagens.

 Aeronaves e navios que chegam dos países incluídos na nova definição de casos de suspeita de covid-19, no entanto, devem passar a receber avisos sonoros com alertas sobre sintomas, como já ocorre para aqueles com passageiros que vêm da China. 

 O secretário de vigilância em saúde, Wanderson Oliveira, afirma que as mudanças ocorrem para aumentar a atenção da rede de saúde diante de possíveis casos. Caso haja uma possível interrupção na expansão dos casos fora da China, o critério poderá ser revisto.

 ""Estamos vendo uma expansão fora do território chinês, mas ainda pequena. Temos que ficar atentos. Essa orientação é mais para que as pessoas possam se prevenir, uma vez que não há medicamento e vacina, e os profissionais identificarem os casos para melhor tratamento"", diz. 

 Ainda segundo o ministério, a previsão é que [o grupo de brasileiros que veio de Wuhan e que hoje está em quarentena em uma base militar em Anápolis (GO) passe por uma terceira rodada de exames ](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/equilibrioesaude/2020/02/novos-exames-em-brasileiros-que-vieram-de-wuhan-dao-negativo-para-novo-coronavirus.shtml)a partir desta sexta. As amostras devem ser enviadas para laboratórios de Goiás e do Rio de Janeiro. 

 Caso os resultados forem negativos, o grupo poderá ser liberado ainda antes de completar os 18 dias inicialmente previstos. A decisão ocorre por já ter passado o período máximo avaliado para que houvesse o desenvolvimento de sintomas e devido ao resultado negativo para o vírus em outros dois exames já realizados.

 Em geral, o tempo médio de incubação do novo coronavírus, como é chamado o período entre a infecção e o desenvolvimento de sintomas, tem sido de cinco dias. A OMS, porém, recomenda que medidas de quarentena e análises considerem o período de 14 dias --o qual termina nesta sexta (21). 

 ### Casos fora da China

 A Organização Mundial da Saúde (OMS) está preocupada com o surgimento de casos do novo coronavírus fora da China que não apresentam um vínculo epidemiológico claro com a origem da epidemia, disse nesta sexta-feira seu diretor, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus.

 ""Embora o número total de casos fora da China permaneça relativamente baixo, estamos preocupados com o número de casos sem uma ligação epidemiológica clara, como histórico de viagens ou contatos com um caso confirmado"", afirmou. 

 A OMS enviará no sábado uma equipe internacional para a cidade chinesa de Wuhan, epicentro da epidemia no centro da China, declarou seu chefe em coletiva de imprensa.

 A ""janela de oportunidade"" para erradicar a epidemia ""está se estreitando"", alertou o diretor da OMS.

 ""É por isso que pedimos à comunidade internacional que aja rapidamente, incluindo em questões de financiamento. Não é o que estamos vendo"", afirmou.

 ""Enquanto falamos, ainda estamos em uma fase em que é possível conter a epidemia, mas com uma janela de oportunidade cada vez menor"", acrescentou.

 A epidemia já infectou mais de 75.500 pessoas na China e 1.150 em 26 outros países.

 O novo vírus matou mais de 2.200 pessoas na China e outras 8 em todo o mundo, segundo a OMS. 

 ""Não devemos olhar para trás e lamentar que não aproveitamos a janela de oportunidade disponível"", disse ele, enfatizando a importância de se tomar medidas ""proporcionadas"".

 O chefe da OMS, no entanto, não quis especificar mais detalhadamente quais deveriam ser as medidas que os países deveriam adotar ou não, enfatizando que era necessário examinar cada situação.

 Sobre a situação na China, ele disse que a equipe internacional de especialistas liderada pela OMS visitou Pequim, Sichuan e Guangdong e viajará amanhã para Wuhan."

Basically consider buying (in order of importance):

1. Food that you already consume. This is important. If you can (/need to) stay at home, the rest of this list becomes obsolete.
2. Liquid soap for washing hands and laundry detergent for clothes. Bleach or something similar would be helpful as well (READ the labels and use as instructed).
3. Hand sanitizer for when you can't wash your hands.
4. Nitrile gloves.
5. FFP3 masks (FFP2 are also good if those level 3 are hard to find or too expensive).
6. Goggles

More important than buying lots of stuff is learning. Here is some info to get you started:

Other than that, I haven't heard, seen, or experienced any racism personally ... yet.  But there is this local Chinese Restaurant right next to a Target that I frequent.

So unless you’re scared of people coming from ALL of the above countries (and want to turn them away because of it) then ... yes.... you are unfairly targeting a group of people. 

Also you would have to ban people from these countries AND people who may have come into contact with people from these countries (aka it’s impossible to know). A Brit who has never left the UK might be contaminated if he sits on metro next to someone with the virus. 

Thus my point: if you’re scared that people who have zero symptoms coming from a non quarantined country are going to make you sick...you shouldn’t host. It’s not a bad thing. You’re not a bad person. If you’re not comfortable then not comfortable. I probably wouldn’t Airbnb my home when I’m there during winter if there’s a flu outbreak (like this year)."

More money printing. It’s good for gold and silver - and gold’s price is all you need to look at to understand that fear is prevalent.

What happens next? A bet on gold continuing to rise (and silver with it, to an extent) is a bet on what happens with the virus. 

Gold will decrease and the markets will boom if the virus is contained. Will we see less reported cases in the future? Unlikely. Will we see a vaccine announced? Also unlikely. For anyone not watching this too closely, you should disregard CCP numbers and see what South Korea, Singapore, Japan (and now possible Iran and Italy, not sure about Iran) report. The CCP can’t be trusted.

If things get worse - more outbreaks around the world, especially an outbreak anywhere on US soil - then I would expect good to easily cross $1800, and silver will rise with it, despite lower anticipated demand from industry. 

I’m betting on things getting worse. I may be wrong, but just letting everyone know where I stand. Obviously, this is just my viewpoint - good luck to all however you bet on this."

Canadian Metro Network

February 21, 2020 16:25

With the increasing number of confirmed and suspected cases of new coronavirus pneumonia, various suggestions for personal protection measures have emerged. In addition to common protective measures such as wearing a mask and washing hands frequently, the issue of household disinfection has also received much attention.

A few days ago, a message proclaiming ""Mr. Zhong Nanshan's anti-virus tricks"" was widely spread on the Internet. It was stated that ""washing the throat with fresh saline can prevent virus infection"".

However, this news is not the opinion of Academician Zhong Nanshan, nor is there any scientific basis. Academician Zhong Nanshan's team openly rumored that salt water gargle is good for cleaning the mouth and throat and is helpful for pharyngitis. However, the area invaded by the new coronavirus is in the respiratory tract, and mouthwashing cannot clean the respiratory tract. Secondly, there are no research results suggesting that saline has a killing effect on the new coronavirus.

So what can we do with the increasingly important situation of virus protection?

Medical alcohol is most commonly used and is available for general occasions

The most common virus killer is medical alcohol.

According to the ""Diagnosis and Treatment of Pneumonia Caused by a New Coronavirus (Trial Version 3)"", 75% alcohol can effectively inactivate the virus. Therefore, under the general requirements of killing, such as ordinary daily necessities, medical alcohol can be used for disinfection. It is best to buy commercial medical alcohol directly, and it is difficult to master the concentration.

Note that white wine cannot be used as a disinfectant, let alone bathing!


Figure 丨 Weibo @ 游 识 猷

Medicinal alcohol refers specifically to 75% alcohol. Alcohol can denature proteins, so it has the effect of killing microorganisms. However, the low-concentration alcohol has a poor killing effect, and the high-concentration alcohol can cause the protein on the surface of the microorganism to solidify too quickly, and the alcohol cannot penetrate into it, and the effect is poor. Practical research has found that alcohol with a concentration of around 75% has a strong killing effect.

Bacteria and viruses are two different types of organisms. Medical alcohol has a strong killing effect on bacteria, but it may not be effective on viruses and may not be effective on many viruses. 2019-nCov can be killed by alcohol because of its protein envelope.

Hand Sanitizer and ""Sterilizing Hand Sanitizer""

Wash your hands frequently with hand sanitizer or soap, and wash your hands with flowing water for more than 20 seconds. It has a certain effect on blocking the spread of the virus and can be used in combination with other protective measures. Hand washing methods can refer to effective prevention of pneumonia, proper hand washing and wearing a mask.

Among all hand washing products, hand sanitizers containing ""fungicide"" are particularly popular. However, like medical alcohol, the germicide in hand sanitizers is not necessarily effective against viruses. For new types of coronaviruses, there is no accurate research conclusion about how effective these fungicides are.

Common hand sanitizers generally use two types of fungicides (or bacteriostatic agents). One is chlorine-containing phenols. The representative substance is p-chloro-xylenol (PCMX). The other is quaternary ammonium salts. Representative substance is benzalkonium chloride (BAC). The common germicidal hand sanitizers on the market are almost all formulated from these two substances.

In some scientific tests, both PCMX and BAC can kill some viruses, such as common influenza viruses. However, the concentration used in experiments is often high, and the elimination effect is strongly related to the type of virus. For example, another common virus, HIV, these fungicides are just for fun.

The active ingredients of disposable hand sanitizers and hand disinfection products are relatively diverse, some are alcohol, some are cetrimonium chloride, hypochlorous acid, etc. They can be used as an alternative when it is not convenient to wash your hands with running soap and your hands are not significantly dirty.

Efficient and high destructive 84 disinfectant

In many people's homes, there is also a common type of disinfectant, which is 84 disinfectant.

The main component of 84 disinfection solution is hypochlorous acid (and hypochlorite). Its disinfection principle is strong oxidizing, which will cause many components in microorganisms to be oxidized and eventually lose their function, unable to reproduce or infect.

Similar to 84 disinfectant is chlorine dioxide. This is also a type of chlorine-containing disinfectant, which can also kill viruses with the help of strong oxidizing properties. At present, it is generally used as a disinfectant for tap water.


Because it has strong oxidizing properties, it also has a bleaching effect.

These disinfectants need to be diluted before use. When diluting, pay attention to the concentration (available chlorine content). In general household disinfection, you can refer to the instructions for disinfection solution to wipe and soak related items. Hypochlorous acid is unstable and easy to decompose. When using 84, pay attention to the expiration date; if you use a disinfection tablet for water, remember to use the ""existing mix"".

However, the use of chlorine-containing disinfectants is strongly irritating. Always follow the instructions when using, pay attention to ventilation, do not get in the eyes and contact the mucous membranes. Another side effect is that because they both generate chlorine atoms, if used on some metal materials, the chlorine atoms will cause long-term corrosion; some equipment related to circuits, such as mobile phone, computer and other equipment, use this type of disinfectant Need to be careful.

Also, it must be noted that 84 disinfectant solutions cannot be used with toilet cleaners. They will chemically generate chlorine gas, which will not only cause disinfection failure, but also the toxicity of chlorine gas will cause harm to the body.

Peracetic acid is cost-effective but has poor stability

During the SARS epidemic in 2003, many people heard about the prestige of peracetic acid, which became the main force for disinfecting public places.

From the perspective of molecular structure, peroxyacetic acid has only one more oxygen than acetic acid, which makes it super oxidizing and has the effect of sterilization. Under normal circumstances, peroxyacetic acid only needs to be formulated into an aqueous solution with a concentration of about 0.005%, which can be used for killing, and it can kill almost all viruses within one minute, and it is very efficient.

However, there is also a significant disadvantage of peroxyacetic acid, which is that it is less stable and easily decomposes. As a dangerous product, it is difficult to buy peracetic acid directly on the market, and for most people, it is not practical to prepare a peroxyacetic acid solution.

Peroxyacetic acid is also corrosive, so be careful when using it. However, it will not have a significant impact on all types of equipment in life.

Physical kill method, need to consider the occasion

Generally speaking, there are no more than two methods for physically killing viruses. One is to use light, usually ultraviolet light; the other is to use heat. Most viruses are sensitive to ultraviolet light and high temperatures.

Relatively speaking, high-temperature anti-virus has high operability in a domestic environment. For example, some items can be boiled in hot water, and clothing can be washed at the highest temperature indicated on the label. According to the guidance of the National Health Commission, heating at 56 ° C for 30 minutes can effectively kill the 2019-nCov virus.

Ultraviolet light is a simple method of disinfection. In the laboratory, it is usually only necessary to turn on the ultraviolet lamp to disinfect the operating table. However, the current domestic UV lamp equipment is usually not designed to kill, and the ultraviolet light they emit may not be suitable for killing viruses. In addition, the side effects of ultraviolet light are very large, it will produce many toxic and harmful substances such as ozone, and may directly cause harm to the human body (electrical ophthalmitis and dermatitis will occur after 20 minutes of exposure). Therefore, the use of UV lamps as a means of eliminating viruses is not recommended.

Other less common disinfectants

In addition to some of the common disinfection methods mentioned above, there are many substances or methods that can also be used to kill viruses, such as ether, chloroform, etc., which have also been identified as effective for new types of coronaviruses.

However, because these substances are often hazardous, such as ether, which is flammable and explosive, and chloroform can easily produce highly toxic phosgene when it is not stored properly, which can cause death. Therefore, they are difficult to purchase and extremely Recommended for non-professionals."

The answer is apparently, yes,"" said Dr. William Schaffner, an infectious disease expert at Vanderbilt University Medical Center, who was not involved in the study.

Researchers have reported sporadic accounts of individuals without any symptoms spreading the virus. What's different in this study is that it offers a natural lab experiment of sorts, Schaffner said.
""You had this patient from Wuhan where the virus is, traveling to where the virus wasn't. She remained asymptomatic and infected a bunch of family members and you had a group of physicians who immediately seized on the moment and tested everyone.""

According to the report by Dr. Meiyun Wang of the People's Hospital of Zhengzhou University and colleagues, the woman traveled from Wuhan to Anyang on Jan. 10 and visited several relatives. When they started getting sick, doctors isolated the woman and tested her for coronavirus. Initially, the young woman tested negative for the virus, but a follow-up test was positive.

All five of her relatives developed COVID-19 pneumonia, but as of Feb. 11, the young woman still had not developed any symptoms, her chest CT remained normal and she had no fever, stomach or respiratory symptoms, such as cough or sore throat.
Scientists in the study said if the findings are replicated, ""the prevention of COVID-19 infection could prove challenging."""

it's entirely possible for a disease to be more or less deadly for certain racial groups, though - certain genetic markers might increase your susceptibility to a disease. in the paper i linked, their hypothesis is that the coronavirus infects cells by binding to their ACE2 receptor, and that asian males are genetically more likely to have more ACE2 receptors in their lungs.

the textbook example of this is usually sickle cell anemia, which is common in those of african descent and exceedingly rare in others. that's because the trait is two-fold - it causes sickle cell disease, but carrying the gene provides resistance to maleria. so in areas with high maleria infection rates (i.e. africa), the sickle cell trait has been genetically selected for."

2020-02-21,rattleandhum,videos,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/videos/comments/f7fqxn/joaquin_phoenix_rescues_mother_cow_and_newborn/fibq23r/,"As I stated I am neither vegetarian nor vegan, nor did i claim that a vegan diet alone was the answer to everything, but it *is* the ethical choice. If that land wasn't being used to grow useless crops it could easily be converted to other crops which we could use, or returned to it's natural state. 

There are multiple problems with industrial farming -- everything from loss of biodiversity, to slash and burn agriculture to make way for grazing cattle, arable land being used to grow crops for said cattle, poor living conditions which amount to torture (especially in footlot farms), runoff and pollution (including lakes of pig shit sickening entire communities), cross-species infections (as evidenced by SARS, MERS, the recent Coronavirus epidemic, and a multitude more), to name but a few.

Collagen, carnosine, mk4, retinol, b12, hemeiron, CLA, coq10 and others can *all* be supplemented. Legumes and nuts *still* don't have nearly as much of an impact on the water table, the environment or natural habitats as beef or lamb. There's no denying the downsides to nut production, but it doesn't hold a candle in terms of environmental impact to *any* meat product, per kilo.

The way we farm can be changed -- should be changed. I'm not convinced that veganism is the answer: as I stated before I still eat meat, though sparingly. The issue at hand is the volume that is consumed in the west, and the manner in which we raise and slaughter these animals, as well as how we devastate the environment in the process of obtaining that meat. All that can and should change.

I'll restate it: if you have *any* concern about climate change, you should reduce your intake of animal products. We didn't feast like this for hundreds of thousands of years as a species, and we still did pretty well. We've become selfish, childish gluttons."

I wasn't making a claim on the *actual* \# of cases, I was *only* saying that every one in 10 million Americans has a confirmed case, which is unarguably true. There could be 70 million cases in the US right now, and it wouldn't change the fact that only one out of every 10 million Americans have a confirmed case.

>Based on China's death rate of 2% then that means there are probably 150 infected.

That's not how that works. You *cannot* assume that the death rate will be the same in both countries. I assume you are saying that the infected #'s are false, but in that case why are you assuming that the death #'s are accurate? Not to mention, the number you are using (deaths) is much too sparse to get an accurate estimate of how many infections there are, so you cannot claim that there are ""probably"" 150 cases. If only one more person managed to not die (which could have easily happened), then you would be saying that there are ""probably"" 100 cases, 50 less than your current ""probable"" estimate. 

And by that same logic, given that there have been 0 deaths in the US, there are also *0 cases* in the US, because 0\*50=0. So if that's true, why are we worried about coronavirus at all?

And again, I realize that the average person is much more likely to get infected in a plane. I also realize that every single scientist on the planet knows this, and again, none of them (that I know of) are advocating for people in the US to completely avoid traveling on planes."

The NBA appears to have bought its way back onto China’s good side.  
The National Basketball Association and the Chinese government had a falling out  
late last year after Houston Rockets manager Daryl Morey tweeted out support for the pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong. Beijing responded by suspending broadcasts of NBA games and effectively permitting a boycott of the association in China. On February 5,  
however, the Chinese consul general in New York was offering the NBA his  
heartfelt thanks.  
“While China is bravely fighting the virus, people from the United States and all over  
the world are offering massive support in preventing and controlling this outbreak,”  
consul general Huang Ping said during a media briefing, reportedly loading special  
thanks on the NBA, which has donated $1.4 million in cash and supplies to  
charities in Hubei province, where the outbreak began.  
In doing so, the NBA has joined the ranks of billionaires, businesses, celebrities, and  
philanthropists that have promised donations to help combat the coronavirus.  
The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation has pledged $100 million in support;  
Alibaba founder Jack Ma has committed $14.4 million from his own charity;  
meanwhile, Boeing has shipped 250,000 masks to frontline  
staff.   
But not all of these donations are going to China, and of the resources that are, not  
all are ending up where they need to be.  
Go, NGOs, go  
On January 26, the Ministry of Civil Affairs announced that all donations being  
made to support efforts to contain the coronavirus should be directed through  
one of five government-affiliated charities, including the Hubei Provincial Red  
Cross and the Wuhan Municipal Red Cross—two subsidiaries of the Red Cross  
Association of China.  
But the Red Cross of China is not like the Red Cross overseas, which operates as a  
non-government agency (NGO). The Red Cross Association of China is what Beijing  
calls—with no sense of irony—a government-organized non-government  
organization, or GONGO.  
“GONGOs are usually set up by the government to channel international funding and  
absorb government officials who were laid off during administrative reform in  
the 1990s. They are either spin-offs of government-affiliated service  
organizations or direct creations of government agencies, and are often led by  
retired government officials,” said Li Hui, assistant professor of politics and  
public administration at the University of Hong Kong.   
Deploying former officials to the world of GONGOs gives the government a direct line to  
their activities, and the former bureaucrats are expected to be more attune to  
the ambitions and policies of the Party than their civic counterparts.  
The ruling China Communist Party prefers GONGOs over independent civic NGOs, Li said,  
which still exist but are regarded with suspicion by officials who view them as  
a threat or, at the very least, an interference to Party control.   
Foreign NGOs are even less welcome. In 2017, the central government introduced a law  
requiring foreign NGOs, including those registered in Hong Kong or Taiwan, to  
find a government sponsor before registering as an NGO. The law also brought  
foreign NGOs under direct supervision of the Public Security Bureaus—China's  
police—which are able to inspect an NGO’s finances, staff roster, and office  
facilities.  
“On the one hand, some officials believe that NGOs can help support service delivery  
and resolve social conflicts and are open to collaborate with NGOs in providing  
social services to citizens. On the other hand, the government has devised  
various policy tools to formally and informally restrict NGOs’ ability to  
register, raise revenue, and engage in political activities,” Li says. “The  
political space afforded to NGOs has been tightening.”  
Show me the money  
The Wuhan Red Cross—the GONGO located in the city at the center of the coronavirus  
epidemic—had received over $86 million in cash donations from the public as of  
February 1, according to a local government official.  
It's also gotten stockpiles of supplies, including over 9,000 masks, 64,000  
protective suits, and more than 80,000 pairs of goggles. But on social media,  
frontline medical staff complain that the supplies aren’t being passed along.  
""We appreciate all donations from society; and in order to make sure all supplies  
go to the most needed, we have decided to accept donations ourselves without  
working with the Red Cross,"" said Song Zhan, the  
donation coordination officer for Huoshenshan Hospital, the temporary field  
hospital built in eight days to accommodate the overflow of patients.  
The Red Cross has said there are legitimate reasons why supplies haven’t been forwarded  
to the frontlines, such as donations of masks that are unsuitable for medical  
use. On February 1, however, three officials from the Hubei Red Cross were  
reprimanded for “mishandling donations for the coronavirus,” prompting an  
apology from the organization.   
This isn’t the first time the Red Cross of China has had to apologize for  
mishandling resources during a crisis. When an earthquake struck Sichuan province  
in 2008 and killed 69,000 people, the government appointed the Red Cross as the  
go-to charity for handling donations and relief efforts. A report from Tsinghua  
University in 2009 estimated that 80% of collected  
donations were funnelled straight into government coffers as “extra  
revenue.”  
Side step  
The shortcomings of China’s GONGOs might be why some altruists are deciding to make  
indirect contributions to the coronavirus crisis.   
Of the $100 million pledged by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation,  
for example, $20 million is going to multilateral agencies such as the Centers  
for Disease Control (CDC) and the World Health Organization (WHO), while $60  
million is earmarked for vaccine research. The $14.4 million pledged by the  
Jack Ma Foundation will primarily fund vaccine research, too.  
“It is exciting to see that individuals, foundations, and corporations are donating  
money and supplies to help those affected by the coronavirus,” Li said, “But  
the crises clearly show that the government and the broader society should work  
collectively to explore ways to sustain the newly emerged donation culture  
and support the growth of civic NGOs.”   
NGOs are far from perfect—just look at the Red Cross in Haiti. But  
in funneling donations to government-backed charities, China is staking some of  
its response to the coronavirus crisis on a system mired in the same  
bureaucracy that stymied its initial response to the outbreak.

I'm kind of in the same position when it comes to working out. I've never been a gym bunny but having to take time off work due to the coronavirus scare (I live in Taiwan where winter school holidays got extended from 4wks to 6) I suddenly had waaaay too much time on my hands. So what did I do? Join the nearest gym to my house. 

Nearest because I'm lazy when it comes to working out and I know it. The best thing I've found is getting it done and dusted as soon as possible. The moment I wake up or when I get home from work I don't give myself time to dilly dally. I just go. The moment I sit down it's all over. So I do my best not to give myself that option. 

Second thing that motivates me is that I know I only have to put in 20mins - 3 times per week. That's it. I do interval training (Sprint8) look it up and it's the lazy persons workout ;). I end up spending almost an hour at the gym as I end up doing my yoga stretches there too while I'm still warmed up from my interval training and I switch from the elliptical machine, to the tower and the bike. 

20 mins. Just 20mins.

I always feel better when I do go in comparison to when I didn't. Eventually your brain will start recognising that it's good for you to go subconsciously and it isn't as hard anymore. 

You can do it! I promise! Just takes time to rewire the brain :)."

2020-02-21,thinktankdynamo,worldnews,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/f7msz8/window_of_opportunity_to_contain_coronavirus_is/ficdzir/,"Let's put the risk of dying by Coronavirus in perspective since there are so many misunderstandings about its connection to the influenza virus.

[The CDC states that the death burden of influenza is roughly 61,000/45,000,000 infections.](https://www.cdc.gov/flu/about/burden/index.html) The fatality percentage of influenza is 0.13%.

The death burden of the Covid-19 is around [2% at the moment](https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/coronavirus-death-rate/) but may [go up as SARS did after 2003](http://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2003/05/estimates-sars-death-rates-revised-upward)

Let's do some quick math to determine how much more deadly, at a minimum, Covid-19 is compared to influenza virus.

0.02/0.0013= 15.[3846153846](tel:3846153846)

At a minimum, Coronavirus is **15.4 times** deadlier than the Influenza Virus and twice as contagious; [R-value of Coronavirus is 2.2-2.5 at the moment and may go higher based on incoming data](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/02/04/researchers-say-the-coronavirus-may-be-more-contagious-than-current-data-shows.html) and [""The median R value for seasonal influenza was 1.28 (IQR: 1.19-1.37)""](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25186370)

Let's stop pretending that it is the equivalent of a common cold. It is a serious disease that spreads easily and often without symptoms.

Let's also put an end to the idea that the mortality rate should go down because ""there are many more undiagnosed people unaccounted for"". By the same logic, there are also many more Covid-19 deaths unaccounted for. And [China is controlling the WHO numbers that get reported](https://youtu.be/G5VGPYtbTk8). China is also known to severely under report deaths of even influenza because of ""pre-existing medical conditions"" or pneumonia.They have been doing the same with Covid-19.

There are some people suggesting that the R-value of Covid-19 should go down because after the winter season. The minimum time it takes to show symptoms for Covid-19 is 2 days; some say 24 days. And it spreads throughout that entire incubation period. So you can easily pass it on without knowing that you have it.

Contrast that with Influenza:

[""Symptoms can begin about 2 days (but can range from 1 to 4 days)  after the virus enters the body. That means that you may be able to pass on the flu to someone else before you know you are sick, as well as while you are sick. Some people can be infected with the flu virus but have no symptoms. During this time, those people may still spread the virus to others.""](https://www.cdc.gov/flu/about/disease/spread.htm)

1-4 days VS 2-24 days. Which will be more likely to spread?

[The median incubation days for Covid-19 is 5.2 days and the mean incubation of Influenza is 2 days. ](https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/coronavirus-incubation-period/)

That's more than double the incubation time and suggests that the R-values for Covid-19 should go higher rather than lower.

Not to mention the [possibility that Covid-19](https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/3876197) is beginning to mutate, which means that you can get reinfected with a Covid-19 variant even if you do beat it the first time.

The NBA appears to have bought its way back onto China’s good side.

The National Basketball Association and the Chinese government had a falling out late last year after Houston Rockets manager Daryl Morey tweeted out support for the pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong. Beijing responded by suspending broadcasts of NBA games and effectively permitting a boycott of the association in China. On February 5, however, the Chinese consul general in New York was offering the NBA his heartfelt thanks.

“While China is bravely fighting the virus, people from the United States and all over the world are offering massive support in preventing and controlling this outbreak,” consul general Huang Ping said during a media briefing, reportedly loading special thanks on the NBA, which has donated $1.4 million in cash and supplies to charities in Hubei province, where the outbreak began.

In doing so, the NBA has joined the ranks of billionaires, businesses, celebrities, and philanthropists that have promised donations to help combat the coronavirus. The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation has pledged $100 million in support; Alibaba founder Jack Ma has committed $14.4 million from his own charity; meanwhile, Boeing has shipped 250,000 masks to frontline staff.

But not all of these donations are going to China, and of the resources that are, not all are ending up where they need to be.

Go, NGOs, go

On January 26, the Ministry of Civil Affairs announced that all donations being made to support efforts to contain the coronavirus should be directed through one of five government-affiliated charities, including the Hubei Provincial Red Cross and the Wuhan Municipal Red Cross—two subsidiaries of the Red Cross Association of China.

But the Red Cross of China is not like the Red Cross overseas, which operates as a non-government agency (NGO). The Red Cross Association of China is what Beijing calls—with no sense of irony—a government-organized non-government organization, or GONGO.

“GONGOs are usually set up by the government to channel international funding and absorb government officials who were laid off during administrative reform in the 1990s. They are either spin-offs of government-affiliated service organizations or direct creations of government agencies, and are often led by retired government officials,” said Li Hui, assistant professor of politics and public administration at the University of Hong Kong.

Deploying former officials to the world of GONGOs gives the government a direct line to their activities, and the former bureaucrats are expected to be more attune to the ambitions and policies of the Party than their civic counterparts.

The ruling China Communist Party prefers GONGOs over independent civic NGOs, Li said, which still exist but are regarded with suspicion by officials who view them as a threat or, at the very least, an interference to Party control.

Foreign NGOs are even less welcome. In 2017, the central government introduced a law requiring foreign NGOs, including those registered in Hong Kong or Taiwan, to find a government sponsor before registering as an NGO. The law also brought foreign NGOs under direct supervision of the Public Security Bureaus—China's police—which are able to inspect an NGO’s finances, staff roster, and office facilities.

“On the one hand, some officials believe that NGOs can help support service delivery and resolve social conflicts and are open to collaborate with NGOs in providing social services to citizens. On the other hand, the government has devised various policy tools to formally and informally restrict NGOs’ ability to register, raise revenue, and engage in political activities,” Li says. “The political space afforded to NGOs has been tightening.”

Show me the money

The Wuhan Red Cross—the GONGO located in the city at the center of the coronavirus epidemic—had received over $86 million in cash donations from the public as of February 1, according to a local government official. It's also gotten stockpiles of supplies, including over 9,000 masks, 64,000 protective suits, and more than 80,000 pairs of goggles. But on social media, frontline medical staff complain that the supplies aren’t being passed along.

""We appreciate all donations from society; and in order to make sure all supplies go to the most needed, we have decided to accept donations ourselves without working with the Red Cross,"" said Song Zhan, the donation coordination officer for Huoshenshan Hospital, the temporary field hospital built in eight days to accommodate the overflow of patients.

The Red Cross has said there are legitimate reasons why supplies haven’t been forwarded to the frontlines, such as donations of masks that are unsuitable for medical use. On February 1, however, three officials from the Hubei Red Cross were reprimanded for “mishandling donations for the coronavirus,” prompting an apology from the organization.

This isn’t the first time the Red Cross of China has had to apologize for mishandling resources during a crisis. When an earthquake struck Sichuan province in 2008 and killed 69,000 people, the government appointed the Red Cross as the go-to charity for handling donations and relief efforts. A report from Tsinghua University in 2009 estimated that 80% of collected donations were funnelled straight into government coffers as “extra revenue.”

Side step

The shortcomings of China’s GONGOs might be why some altruists are deciding to make indirect contributions to the coronavirus crisis.

Of the $100 million pledged by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, for example, $20 million is going to multilateral agencies such as the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) and the World Health Organization (WHO), while $60 million is earmarked for vaccine research. The $14.4 million pledged by the Jack Ma Foundation will primarily fund vaccine research, too.

“It is exciting to see that individuals, foundations, and corporations are donating money and supplies to help those affected by the coronavirus,” Li said, “But the crises clearly show that the government and the broader society should work collectively to explore ways to sustain the newly emerged donation culture and support the growth of civic NGOs.”

NGOs are far from perfect—just look at the Red Cross in Haiti. But in funneling donations to government-backed charities, China is staking some of its response to the coronavirus crisis on a system mired in the same bureaucracy that stymied its initial response to the outbreak."

Before then it was clear that western markets can curb china, as it has grown too large and too needed to be the manufacturing block of the world. As a reality check, russia has been for a very long time on very low gdp, yet it has steadily risen in the face of harshest sanctions and now trade wars to be stable and growing slowly(reletively). So gdp means nothing, and those who report it, and discuss metrics of it in terms of imminent collapse are just loons.

What our various levels of government in Canada are reporting are termed ""confirmed cases"".  They have defined what a confirmed case is and it requires double testing.  They have also defined what the bar is to qualify for the double testing in the first place.  As such, they can control how many cases are tested.  The bar, as I have discussed previously, is essentially that you are in material distress with symptoms of COVID-19 AND you have recently been to Wuhan or in contact with someone who has.  That's a VERY small net for what is now a clearly global outbreak. 

It is statistically unlikley, based on the academic models and based on what we are seeing in Singapore, South Korea, Hong Kong, Japan, Iran and Italy that Canada only has or has had the 10-12 cases that the government has reported.  Again, what they are telling us is the ""confirmed cases"".  They are playing weasel words so they can't be accused of lying when history judges them. 

It looks increasingly likely that they understand how quickly and widely this will spread and they have been using the high bar for testing to keep the quoted numbers down and keep people calm.  The US and Uk also appear guilty of this.  Hopefully they used the time to plan and position resources to respond to a ramp, should it come.  At least the US and the UK have regularly been scaling up their ""if it comes here, this is what will happen"" messaging, and demonstrating action.

Before everyone piles on and calls me a prepper or a doomer, I'll just leave this snippet from today from the CDC here for you to digest.  No one appears to want to hear or digest the uncomfortable news.  Look closely at the last couple of sentences. The words are intentionally soft but digest what the CDC is saying is likley to be required in the US once this spreads (my emphasis in bold):

""1 pm: US health officials prepare for coronavirus outbreak to become pandemic

[U.S. health officials are preparing for the COVID-19 coronavirus to become a pandemic,](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/02/21/us-health-officials-prepare-for-coronavirus-outbreak-to-become-pandemic.html)  the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said Friday. “We’re not  seeing community spread here in the United States, yet, but it’s very  possible, even likely, that it may eventually happen,” Dr. Nancy  Messonnier, director of the CDC’s National Center for Immunization and  Respiratory Diseases, told reporters on a conference call. “Our goal  continues to be to slowing the introduction of the virus into the U.S.  This buys us more time to prepare communities for more cases and  possibly sustained spread.” Messonnier pointed to China where schools  and businesses have been shuttered for weeks to contain the outbreak  there, saying the U.S. may eventually need to do the same. **“The day may  come where we may need to implement such measures in this country,”** she  said. *— Lovelace, Feuer""*

Canada is not immune.  It would be a good idea to make sure perscriptions are filled, your first aid kit is stocked, and you have adequate supplies at home to stay in for a few weeks in the coming month or two, if that is required.  Thankfully, it is likely we will continue to enjoy water, power, internet, TV etc.  So this isn't a doomsday scenario.

Failing to plan is planning to fail.  Be responsible and invest in some supplies.  If the CDC is wrong, it's a small insurance premium.  If they are right, buckle-up."

The calculation above (which major News outlets have used incorrectly) being done the correct way would still be lower than the actual numbers due to many reasons

First, Chinese need to make it appear that they have it under control to the World, to mitigate as much Economic impact to them as a Nation for as long as they can. Numbers would be underreported. 

Additionally, they have quarantined people in their own homes so they don't have the most accurate numbers because people either are riding it out at home if they do have it, haven't had symptoms since the incubation period appears to be longer than a month, have died in their own homes and no one knows yet, they're simply terrified of what the government would do to them if they did go to the hospital, or, there simply aren't enough resources to not only test everyone, but, to conduct thorough testing at all. Numbers would be underreported. 

For example, the way a virus (especially a retrovirus) works, given rough testing (not specific to the virus or additional testing or labs to confirm findings on different days) leads to many false negatives. Numbers would be underreported. 

This is what appears to be the case if you search for coronavirus false negatives, leading people to get sent home as ''cured'' only to further spread it (like a post-incubation period)."

As of now this is not confirmed. [This](https://www.livescience.com/coronavirus-superspreader-south-korea-church.html) article has the # of confirmed cases at 37, with 52 showing symptoms. That's much less than 500 or more. I assume that number is from a Reuters article that says 500 members are showing symptoms, but that was the only article I've seen with that number, so it might have been a miscommunication.

>So why 100% nastier? That's a minimum.

But *why* is it a minimum? Why isn't the minimum 200%, or 30%, or 0%? Where are you getting 100% from?

>The incubation period has been proven at 34 days, and several at 24 days

But again, what reason is there to use the maximum instead of the average? The average incubation time is what most people are facing, not the 34 day one.

>Most airborne viruses like TB and measles carry r0 of 10+

But Coronavirus *isn't* TB or measles. And saying that ""most airborne viruses"" have an R0 of 10+ is ***not*** true, and in fact is ***completely, utterly false***. MERS is an airborne virus, and it's R0 was actually *less* than 1, and estimated at .3-.8. SARS, which is probably the virus closest to the current one, and definitely is the one you *should* be using to judge Coronavirus' R0 instead of measles, has an estimated R0 of 2-5, which (shocker) is about the range of Coronavirus' estimates for R0. The Spanish flu had an R0 of 2-3. In fact, if we ***look at coronaviruses that are airborne***, we would get a range closer to 1-5 than 10, which is what the estimate currently is anyway, so your whole thing about how ""the coronavirus is way deadlier now"" makes absolutely ***no*** sense, and would get you laughed out of the room if you claimed it to people who knew what they were talking about.

>With the combination of the properties listed above, I would say the risk is ten times worse than initially thought when the virus was thought to be droplet infection and symptomatic with a 4 day incubation

Again, ***laughably*** false. Not to mention it was always an airborne viruses, including when they estimated its R0 in the ***first place***. Nothing about the virus has become deadlier, it's just that we know now that it is an airborne virus, like it always was. And given that you seem to have not researched the R0's of ***any*** disease other than measles, please don't put ""scientifically"" in your post. I don't think most of your claims are backed up by the scientific community."

I’m not currently worried about Coronavirus but I figured it was common curtesy to the other patients, especially infants who might be there for well visits.

He was diagnosed with bronchitis, an ear infection, and pink eye (poor kid is miserable!). No one in the office was wearing masks, but I made sure he sat in the sick child waiting area and kept his mask on. When she came in, the doctor thanked me for putting a mask on him. She said they had recently run out of surgical masks at their practice and the order is on back order. They are making do with thoroughly cleaning rooms between patients. Honestly I think Americans would benefit in general if we all took the Asian approach of wearing a mask when we are sick. Also self isolating. I kept him home from school all week.

2020-02-21,Eversnuffley,Coronavirus,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/f7kg3o/covid19_cases_by_continent_excluding_china_with/fibw2yn/,"Update for Feb 21, 2020

Continuing the format I began yesterday, the new cases have been graphed by continent, with a special category for cruise ships and any other future vessels not connected with a continent. This information takes a little to longer to aggregate, so typically the data will be one day behind. 

These data are as accurate as possible based on the data sources.

I have also included a layman's model of growth. This is an experiment in trying to model the growth, and then mapping this model over the actual virus growth over the course of a couple of weeks. 

The model is based on a rate of infection of 1.5 and a mean incubation period of 6 days. It also assumes identified cases are not longer infecting others after a mean period of 14 days. Finally, it assumes an injection of initial infections from China which accelerated the beginning of the growth.

**This model should not be considered predictive.** This is just an exercise in data modelling, and might be helpful to some for observing the change in daily growth numbers relative to a fixed model.

I hope some of you find this useful.

This Friday (21), the Ministry of Health updated the definition of a suspected case for the new coronavirus. Now, within this definition, people who have fever and another flu-like symptom, such as cough or shortness of breath, and who come from Japan, Singapore, South Korea, North Korea, Thailand, Vietnam and Cambodia, in addition to China, are included within this definition. The decision of the portfolio to increase the level of security and sensitivity of surveillance arose from the concern that these countries have generated due to the large number of cases of the new coronavirus in recent days.

Although there is an alert for Brazilians in transit to these places, there is no recommendation to avoid travel, as in the case of China, which is in quarantine. “People are isolated in China, so we recommend that trips there should only be made if there was a plausible justification. But this is dynamic. If this scenario changes, our recommendations will be updated ”, highlighted the Secretary of Health Surveillance at the Ministry of Health, Wanderson de Oliveira.
According to the Executive Secretary of the Ministry of Health, João Gabbardo, the new definition should lead to an increase in suspected cases for the new coronavirus in Brazil, since the flow of people arriving from Asia in the country is large, especially from the Japan. However, he reiterates that the health system and laboratories in Brazil are prepared to monitor and evaluate cases.

“We are seeing an expansion in the number of cases outside of Chinese territory. We have to be aware. This guidance is worth much more for people to prevent themselves, since they still do not have specific treatment and vaccine, and for professionals to identify suspected cases. We are attentive to the Brazilians who will go to these places. This alert applies to everyone, both for those who come and for those who go. The measures are necessary and fundamental and we are systematically reiterating these measures to avoid transmission ”, he explained.

Until this Friday (21), only one suspected case of infection with the new coronavirus is monitored by the Ministry of Health. The case is from Rio de Janeiro. In all, 51 suspected cases were discarded after laboratory tests showed negative results for the new coronavirus. Brazil remains without a record of the circulation of the new coronavirus. To keep the population informed about the new coronavirus, the Ministry of Health daily updates the data on the IVIS Platform , with numbers of discarded and suspected cases, in addition to the definitions of these cases and any changes that may occur in relation to the epidemiological situation."

I have been going to PAX East for 8 years straight. It's amazing every year and literally my favorite weekend of the year. My sister, two cousins, and one of my closest friends joins me and we all have the best time. We generally game together every night so this is the perfect way to enjoy it together in person.

I got our tix this year. We were going Friday and Saturday like most years. I got the hotel a year in advance guessing the correct date at a cheap price. We were so excited!

The drawback is I'm a bit of a germaphobe. I don't mind a little PAX pox for the experience, but this year is different. What if that illness is Coronavirus? I realize the chance is incredibly slim, but the impact would be very high. I have a 2 year old at home, if I contracted this and spread it to her without knowing I had it (which is possible), I'd hate myself. If I had any cold post pax I'd be incredibly paranoid thinking it's corona and go to the doctor immediately. Every year I get sick, but this year I'd be terrified.

I chose to still go, but if one thing happens like someone else in Boston gets coronavirus (which means the one case spread it) or if something else severe happened, I'm not going. IMO Sony not going was the last straw for me. If this huge company is willing to burn all that money to avoid the possibility, that was enough to put me over the edge. At this point if I go I'm not touching anything and watching everyone around me and I won't be enjoying myself.

I broke the news to my family and they were upset, but understood. They knew I was worried for my daughter. 

I cancelled the hotel room last night and just sold two of my Saturday tix (I have 4 Friday and 2 Saturday if anyone needs them) and the feeling I have selling them is that sick feeling I get at the end of PAX without actually being there. It really sucks... But it feels like the right thing to do for me.

If you're going, please be safe. Wash your hands often, bring sanitizer, and try your best to not touch your face."

2 items: 

1, A doctor’s general description of symptoms for the Covid’s first three weeks of illness.

2. A day by day description of symptoms (from day 1 through day 12) and treatment for the first patient in the USA. He began feeling ill on Jan. 15, was admitted to the hospital on Jan. 20th, and was released from the hospital Feb. 3rd/4.

Symptoms explained by Doctor ihttps://www.straitstimes.com/asia/east-asia/reporters-notebook-life-and-death-in-a-wuhan-coronavirus-icu: 

“I've observed that the breakout period of the novel coronavirus tends to be three weeks, from the onset of symptoms to developing difficulties breathing. Basically going from mild to severe symptoms takes about a week. There are all sorts of mild symptoms: feebleness, shortness of breath, some people have fevers, some don't. Based on studies of our 138 cases, the most common symptoms in the first stage are fever (98.6 per cent of cases), feebleness (69.6 per cent), cough (59.4 per cent), muscle pains (34.8 per cent), difficulties breathing (31.2%), while less common symptoms include headaches, dizziness, stomach pain, diarrhea, nausea, vomiting.

But some patients who enter the second week will suddenly get worse. At this stage, people should go to the hospital. The elderly with underlying conditions may develop complications; some may need machine-assisted respiration. When the body's other organs start to fail, that's when it becomes severe, while those with strong immune systems see their symptoms decrease in severity at this stage and gradually recover. So the second week is what determines whether the illness becomes critical.

The third week determines whether critical illness leads to death. Some in critical condition who receive treatment can raise their level of lymphocytes, a type of white blood cell, and see an improvement in their immune systems, and have been brought back, so to speak. But those whose lymphocyte numbers continue to decline, those whose immune systems are destroyed in the end, experience multiple organ failure and die.

For most, the illness is over in two weeks, whereas for those for whom the illness becomes severe, if they can survive three weeks, they're good. Those that can't will die in three weeks.”

Symptom Progression Day 1 to Day 12 From
First Case of 2019 Novel Coronavirus in the United States 

35 year old male

https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2001191

On January 19, 2020, a 35-year-old man presented to an urgent care clinic in Snohomish County, Washington, with a 4-day history of cough and subjective fever. On checking into the clinic, the patient put on a mask in the waiting room. After waiting approximately 20 minutes, he was taken into an examination room and underwent evaluation by a provider. He disclosed that he had returned to Washington State on January 15 after traveling to visit family in Wuhan, China. The patient stated that he had seen a health alert from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) about the novel coronavirus outbreak in China and, because of his symptoms and recent travel, decided to see a health care provider....

Given the patient’s travel history, the local and state health departments were immediately notified. Together with the urgent care clinician, the Washington Department of Health notified the CDC Emergency Operations Center. Although the patient reported that he had not spent time at the Huanan seafood market and reported no known contact with ill persons during his travel to China, CDC staff concurred with the need to test the patient for 2019-nCoV on the basis of current CDC “persons under investigation” case definitions.8 Specimens were collected in accordance with CDC guidance and included serum and nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swab specimens. After specimen collection, the patient was discharged to home isolation with active monitoring by the local health department.
On January 20, 2020, the CDC confirmed that the patient’s nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabs tested positive for 2019-nCoV by real-time reverse-transcriptase–polymerase-chain-reaction (rRT-PCR) assay. In coordination with CDC subject-matter experts, state and local health officials, emergency medical services, and hospital leadership and staff, the patient was admitted to an airborne-isolation unit at Providence Regional Medical Center for clinical observation, with health care workers following CDC recommendations for contact, droplet, and airborne precautions with eye protection.

On admission, the patient reported persistent dry cough and a 2-day history of nausea and vomiting; he reported that he had no shortness of breath or chest pain. Vital signs were within normal ranges. On physical examination, the patient was found to have dry mucous membranes. The remainder of the examination was generally unremarkable. After admission, the patient received supportive care, including 2 liters of normal saline and ondansetron for nausea.


On days 2 through 5 of hospitalization (days 6 through 9 of illness), the patient’s vital signs remained largely stable, apart from the development of intermittent fevers accompanied by periods of tachycardia (Figure 2). The patient continued to report a nonproductive cough and appeared fatigued. On the afternoon of hospital day 2, the patient passed a loose bowel movement and reported abdominal discomfort. A second episode of loose stool was reported overnight; a sample of this stool was collected for rRT-PCR testing, along with additional respiratory specimens (nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal) and serum. The stool and both respiratory specimens later tested positive by rRT-PCR for 2019-nCoV, whereas the serum remained negative.

Treatment during this time was largely supportive. For symptom management, the patient received, as needed, antipyretic therapy consisting of 650 mg of acetaminophen every 4 hours and 600 mg of ibuprofen every 6 hours. He also received 600 mg of guaifenesin for his continued cough and approximately 6 liters of normal saline over the first 6 days of hospitalization.


A chest radiograph taken on hospital day 3 (illness day 7) was reported as showing no evidence of infiltrates or abnormalities (Figure 3). However, a second chest radiograph from the night of hospital day 5 (illness day 9) showed evidence of pneumonia in the lower lobe of the left lung (Figure 4). These radiographic findings coincided with a change in respiratory status starting on the evening of hospital day 5, when the patient’s oxygen saturation values as measured by pulse oximetry dropped to as low as 90% while he was breathing ambient air. On day 6, the patient was started on supplemental oxygen, delivered by nasal cannula at 2 liters per minute. Given the changing clinical presentation and concern about hospital-acquired pneumonia, treatment with vancomycin (a 1750-mg loading dose followed by 1 g administered intravenously every 8 hours) and cefepime (administered intravenously every 8 hours) was initiated.


On hospital day 6 (illness day 10), a fourth chest radiograph showed basilar streaky opacities in both lungs, a finding consistent with atypical pneumonia (Figure 5), and rales were noted in both lungs on auscultation. Given the radiographic findings, the decision to administer oxygen supplementation, the patient’s ongoing fevers, the persistent positive 2019-nCoV RNA at multiple sites, and published reports of the development of severe pneumonia3,4 at a period consistent with the development of radiographic pneumonia in this patient, clinicians pursued compassionate use of an investigational antiviral therapy. Treatment with intravenous remdesivir (a novel nucleotide analogue prodrug in development10,11) was initiated on the evening of day 7, and no adverse events were observed in association with the infusion. Vancomycin was discontinued on the evening of day 7, and cefepime was discontinued on the following day, after serial negative procalcitonin levels and negative nasal PCR testing for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus.

On hospital day 8 (illness day 12), the patient’s clinical condition improved. Supplemental oxygen was discontinued, and his oxygen saturation values improved to 94 to 96% while he was breathing ambient air. The previous bilateral lower-lobe rales were no longer present. His appetite improved, and he was asymptomatic aside from intermittent dry cough and rhinorrhea. 

As of January 30, 2020, the patient remains hospitalized. He is afebrile, and all symptoms have resolved with the exception of his cough, which is decreasing in severity.

They were also still apparently holding group activities like quiz night and crap. There was a ""coronavirus task force"" setuo by the government which was nothing more than a farce, seems like people were skipping it to go do leisure activities

The fact that it wasn't a quarantine but more a giant breeding room means that the Japanese screening passengers as they left the ship was meaningless. Basically everyone on the ship is likely at various stages of infection. Of course the Japanese government are refusing to acknowledge it, but as more and more cases of passengers test positive and cases spread in Japan maybe they have to admit it? Then again its Japan"

I think NVDA and INTC have some pretty big moats that AMD will have a hard time crossing. What I’m confused about with AMD’s ticker is that in their earnings they offered conservative guidance, and the stock fell, but immediately came back up. Then it blew up to record highs before getting pulled down over the last two days.

NVDA is crushing it, of course. After they beat earnings the stock price exploded, even after they altered guidance to incorporate supply chain issues from the coronavirus impact. I think the 3XXX line of GPUs are going to blow everybody’s mind, but they may have a hard time getting them shipped for a couple of quarters.

I believe in those companies, but I’m trying to pull back from being a fan of the products and treating a stock purchase like a product purchase.

There are a lot of macroeconomic forces at play pushing the stock prices up that I don’t think are sustainable, and I’m worried that even though these companies are stellar, they’re going to get pulled back down a little bit.

Things like gold prices, bond yields, and the VIX seem to indicate things might get a little gross soon. Also, it’s an election year, so... that could get interesting.

These are my two cents, though. I waited on the sidelines to handle some personal finance stuff (house down payment, build an emergency fund, etc) and only socked money in ETFs for the longest time until last year. I really wish I had been in the market instead.

So, I’m probably wrong. Honestly you sound like you know more about what you’re talking about than I do."

In France, lighting hits the ground 1 000 000/year on an average. Between 100 et 300 people are hits. We'll take 200 as an average. 
That gives a us a probability of 200*100/1000000=0,02%.

Among those people, 8 to 15 people die from it. We'll take 12 as an average. That gives us a mortality rate of 12*100/200=6%

Actually, you're less likely to be hit by the lightning than dying of the coronavirus but you're more likely to die from it. 

Despite that, it is important to understand that the biggest problem with the coronavirus. The R0 (contagiousness/transmission risk) of flu is between 1.5-2,5. That means that on a population fully receptive you would infect max 2,5 people (but since the population is receptive, these 2,5 people would infect 2,5*3 people). To compare, the max R0 estimated for the coronavirus (source : https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3525558) is 6,47. That's only 2,588 times more. And this 6,47 is not the average of all the studies, just the one who saw it the biggest. The average is around 3. But these numbers apply in a fully receptive population. The right thing to do is to do like any other disease prevention and adapt correct hygiene and health. 

OP's mother reaction is just ridiculous, based on misunderstanding of the information and fear of this miseducation."

The video to me looks like a guy who has collapsed with a seizure for 20 seconds and died. 

I find it interesting that there have been countless videos of people randomly collapsing in Wuhan and the odds of that proliferation not being connected to the coronavirus outbreak to me is low enough to pay attention to this topic.

The NBC link I provided cites medical research linking influenza to heart attacks. 
""People who caught flu in Canada between 2009 and 2014 had a six-fold higher risk of suffering a heart attack in the seven days after they were diagnosed, the team at the Institute for Clinical Evaluative Sciences (ICES) and Public Health Ontario reported."" 

So generally, we can link viruses with heart attacks. Maybe, the same effect is in this new virus but is more pronounced?

We know that this new virus attaches to ACE2:
https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3944399/

""Since SARS-CoV outbreak in 2002, extensive structural analyses have revealed key atomic-level interactions between SARS-CoV spike protein receptor-binding domain (RBD) and its host receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which regulate both the cross-species and human-to-human transmissions of SARS-CoV.""


If you want academic research linking ACE2 with heart failure:

https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3944399/

""There is substantial experimental evidence evaluating the role of ACE2/Ang(1-7) in hypertension, heart failure, and atherosclerosis.""

Or check this out:
https://www.researchgate.net/publication/10572671_Heart_block_ventricular_tachycardia_and_sudden_death_in_ACE2_transgenic_mice_with_downregulated_connexins

"" We tested the hypothesis that cardiac ACE2 activity contributes to features of ventricular remodeling associated with the renin-angiotensin system by generating transgenic mice with increased cardiac ACE2 expression. These animals had a high incidence of sudden death that correlated with transgene expression levels. ""

You can find more links yourself, just google ""sudden death syndrome ace2"".

Look at the video again, what explains the seizure? The following link describes sudden cardiac arrest. Sudden cardiac arrest can be associated with 10-20 seconds of seizure (which is what we see in this video).

https://www.sca-aware.org/blog/scafoundation/sca-and-heart-attack-understanding-the-difference

""Sudden cardiac arrest (SCA) is different from heart attack. While heart attack is described as a “plumbing problem,” SCA is more of an “electrical problem” that prevents the heart from functioning effectively. Heart attack can lead to SCA, but there are many other causes, such as congenital abnormalities, severe heart failure, electrocution and drug overdose.

When SCA occurs, the heart stops beating altogether. As a result, blood no longer is pumped throughout the body, including the brain. The person suddenly passes out, loses consciousness, and appears lifeless—except for abnormal “gasping” which may last for several minutes.

Occasionally, SCA victims will experience 10-20 seconds of seizure activity (shaking of the arms and legs) at the onset of the event as the brain stops receiving blood and oxygen from the heart."""

“So far, the new coronavirus, dubbed COVID-19, has led to more than 75,000 illnesses and 2,000 deaths, primarily in mainland China. But that's nothing compared with the flu, also called influenza. In the U.S. alone, the flu has already caused an estimated 26 million illnesses, 250,000 hospitalizations and 14,000 deaths this season, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). “

Remember those numbers are with a China population of around 1.3 billion while USA has around 1 million FEWER people living here.  So it even skews it WAY more that you have a greater chance of dying from a normal flu than corona.   But keep on believing the fear-mongering that the media portrays to get clicks/views.

There are probably a whole range of drugs that are needed by Americans that require APIs made in China. Now given the coronavirus problem of supply, I am sure it can affect the production of medicines that are needed in the US. That 30% is not so clear cut that it is directed only to medicines needed by Americans...so therefore the US is not self-sufficient.

The issue was important enough that the FDA director testified before Congress about the issue. This makes it a relevant topic.

If anything, the coronavirus issue highlights the over-reliance on China for an important product - not only in terms of safety but also in terms of supply. One that can have significant effects on Americans. Clearly it also has effects on the US sales worldwide - but I am sure they want to ensure the safety of what they sell...because that affects their bottom line as well."

It's not quite racism as others understand it being such as being beaten up/shot, framed, or turned away from service because of the color of your skin. Remember, white people used to hate drinking from the same water fountain as blacks. Is reverse racism really RACISM?

Even racists in some sense will make fun of minorities and state ""it's not racist, it's freedom of speech."" Or with the outbreak of the coronavirus, ""Who cares about the chinese? They deserve it for eating weird shit."" Then turn away service, sit further away for no reason at all other than their race. Suddenly one minority is riddled with a disease? Racism in general, both sides are stupid, uneducated people."

>Highlights

>• The genomic sequence of 2019-nCoV indicates that the virus clusters with betacoronaviruses of lineage b.

>• 2019-nCoV S-protein sequence has a specific furin-like cleavage site absent in lineage b CoV including SARS-CoV sequences.

>• The furin-like cleavage site in the S-protein of 2019-nCoV may have implications for the viral life cycle and pathogenicity.

>• Campaigns to develop anti-2019-nCoV therapeutics should include the evaluation of furin inhibitors.

>Abstract

>In 2019, a new coronavirus (2019-nCoV) infecting Humans has emerged in Wuhan, China. Its genome has been sequenced and the genomic information promptly released. Despite a high similarity with the genome sequence of SARS-CoV and SARS-like CoVs, we identified a peculiar furin-like cleavage site in the Spike protein of the 2019-nCoV, lacking in the other SARS-like CoVs. In this article, we discuss the possible functional consequences of this cleavage site in the viral cycle, pathogenicity and its potential implication in the development of antivirals."

BoP was a good movie. There were other factors that affected the box office like poor marketing, Coronavirus, bad timing, etc. Plenty of directors turned down Superman in favor of other characters. He is simply a difficult character to make interesting. Also people tend to push back on any deviations to the character and makes WB wary of new pitches.

I think it will be a couple years of struggling hospitals and rough outcomes, but we will come out on top. You know, you don't need to get ""infected"" to become resistant. If your body manages to fight it off quickly, you can gain resilience without sickness. Also, even if you get sick, you may only get a cold. 

This is something that people should be worried about, but not panicked. Buckle up and be tough, trust in your body to beat this bastard coronavirus off and take vitamin D supple mentation regularly.

Absent clear data on who has the disease, let alone how they’re moving around and interacting with other people, scientists have to calculate R0 by doing complicated simulations using a variety of possible methods.

This reduces labour migration, household consumption, travel and tourism, and operation of shops and factories. But it is likely to generate negative economic impacts only for one or two quarters and not the whole year.Workers return to their jobs in the Longgang District of Shenzhen, Guangdong Province, southern China, 10 February 2020. The Chinese authorities are carefully balancing efforts to control the new coronavirus and minimize its impact on the economy as millions of people returned to work last week after a prolonged holiday (Photo: Reuters/Liang Xu).

This year is of particular significance for China. It is the deadline for both the completion of building a comprehensive well-off society and the 13th Five-Year Plan. The three most symbolic objectives scheduled to be achieved by the end of 2020 are: doubling GDP based on its 2010 volume; doubling average household income compared to its 2010 level; and completely eliminating rural poverty.

Whether these objectives are achieved will be indicative of the extent that the epidemic has impeded China’s long-term development and how much the world can rely on China’s growth, as China contributed over 40 per cent to global growth in 2019.

It is too early to assess precisely China’s economic losses and damage to people’s livelihood with the epidemic yet to be contained and economic activities still on hold. But based on emerging trends of the epidemic and what China had already done by the end of 2019 towards accomplishing the goals it has set, China can be confident in meeting them by the end of 2020.

The first goal is to double China’s GDP based over the base of 2010. China’s GDP was 41.2 trillion RMB (US$5.9 trillion) in 2010 and it is expected to reach 82.4 trillion RMB (US$11.8 trillion) this year. China will need a growth rate between 5.54 and 5.63 per cent to realise its goal of doubling GDP in 2020.

The underlying trend of China’s growth will determine whether China will reach its target. Since China’s working age population is shrinking, causing the population dependency ratio to rise, a growth slowdown is expected. The year 2019 saw the lowest GDP growth post-1990, and it is expected to slump further in 2020 and beyond. Before the coronavirus outbreak, economists expected a growth rate of 5.8 to 6 per cent for 2020.

Economists have different estimates of the impacts of the coronavirus epidemic on China’s growth rate in 2020. The estimates range between 5.5–5.7 per cent depending on assumptions about whether the coronavirus will be contained, allowing economic activities to resume, by the end of the first quarter or the second quarter. But both scenarios will allow China to accomplish its goal of doubling its 2010 GDP.

The second goal is to double household income. Average disposable income of rural and urban households was 12,520 RMB (US$1800) in 2010 and is expected to increase to 26,795 RMB (US$3600) at constant prices by the end of 2020. Thanks to the inflation of ordinary workers’ wages as a result of a labour shortage and minimum wage rise, household income has rapidly increased at an annual rate of 7.79 per cent. As a result, household income increased to 24,582 RMB (US$3500) in real terms in 2019. The objective of doubling household income can be easily achieved with a growth rate of just 1.9 per cent this year.

The third goal is eliminating rural poverty. The poverty line is defined at 2300 RMB (US$330) at 2011 prices with expected yearly adjustment based on price index and other considerations. In 2012, there were 99 million rural poor — population with income under 2673 RMB (US$383) per person per year.

Between 2012–2019, the average number of people lifted out of poverty each year was over 13 million, leaving only 5.5 million to be lifted out of poverty in 2020. Fulfilling the goal of reduction in poverty by the end of 2020 can be expected.

Even though the coronavirus epidemic will generate short-term economic pain, China’s long-term development and the achievement of the goals outlined in its 13th Five-Year Plan by the end of 2020 are still on track.

I'm not so familiar with the herpes family, despite having gotten shingles at a young age for it, but my understanding is that the chicken pox varicella zoster virus hides out in a dormant manner in nerve cells, not giving the immune system anything to latch onto unless and until it erupts.  And there's a vaccine for singles, it's a quadruple dose of the chickenpox one.  Which despite having already gotten shingles, I'm still advised to take in some number of years.

Do you have any knowledge of how other herpes viruses hide out?

But you do have *a* point, we've never made a successful coronavirus vaccine, just haven't had the ethical opportunity to do it.  That said, shouldn't what you fear ought to be happening with the circulating for forever coronaviruses that are a significant fraction of ""the common cold?"""

Eighteen cases have been confirmed among passengers from the Diamond Princess cruise ship now back in the United States. Three cases have been confirmed among passengers from the Wuhan repatriation flights now back in the United States.

Up until yesterday, the CDC was reporting 15 confirmed cases in the United States. The reason that number has dropped to 13 is because two cases have moved into the case count of repatriated individuals.

**Here’s what the latest science says about whether travel bans, border screenings, and quarantines are thwarting the ongoing outbreak.**

BY NSIKAN AKPAN

PUBLISHED FEBRUARY 21, 2020

An unmitigated disaster. That’s how Lawrence Gostin of Georgetown University describes the handling of the Diamond Princess.

For two weeks, the British cruise liner sat quarantined off Japan’s coast, and roughly 3,700 passengers and crew were housed inside a giant incubator for the novel coronavirus, which causes the disease officially known as COVID-19. What started as a manageable group of 10 infections on February 4 ballooned into more than 600 cases by Wednesday, when everyone on board was finally allowed to disembark.

“What should have happened is, they [the passengers and crew] should have been disembarked from the boat and placed in isolation or medical quarantines,” says Gostin, a professor who is also director of the World Health Organization Collaborating Center on National and Global Health Law.

For him and other health academics, the Diamond Princess saga speaks to the imperfect legacy of travel restrictions and disease screening. For centuries, public officials have combed travelers for signs of disease, whether it be for cholera in the 1800s or Ebola crises in the last decade, and cordoned them off.

Yet time and again, history has shown that stemming the spread of an infectious disease becomes more difficult when these control methods are deployed inappropriately or unevenly. Border closures protected some farming villages during Spanish Influenza in 1918 and 1919, but they also kept countries like Portugal from obtaining health resources. Meanwhile, the primary spreaders of the disease—troops in World War I—easily crossed borders. (Learn about the swift, deadly history of the Spanish Flu pandemic.)
Back then, people barely understood how diseases moved among human populations, but today’s epidemiologists have found that the same overarching rule applies to modern outbreaks: Borders are leaky no matter what you do. Now, in the face of COVID-19, these scientists are creating tools that can ostensiblity predict the weak spots—and judge whether tactics like the lockdown of China’s Hubei Province or the Diamond Princess blockade are worth the consequences.

**Did the Wuhan lockdown work?**

Viruses are inherently clandestine, and the one that causes COVID-19 is no exception. As of Friday, this outbreak has infected 76,775 and killed 2,248. Early evidence shows that the novel coronavirus takes about five days to manifest symptoms in mild and severe cases, but patients are contagious before these symptoms arise.

COVID-19 readily establishes itself not only in the lungs, but also in the upper respiratory tract, meaning the nose and throat. A study published Wednesday in the journal Science reports that the novel coronavirus’ affinity for entering human cells is 10 to 20 times higher than that of other coronaviruses. These habits mean the new coronavirus can more easily hitch a ride via coughs and sneezes, and they may explain why people become contagious before displaying full-blown symptoms.

Those details matter, because the timing of when people become contagious can help gauge if changes in travel policy—such as China’s transportation bans and international airport screening—are truly keeping the novel coronavirus from crossing borders.
Matteo Chinazzi, a network scientist at Northeastern University, has co-developed a way to judge the effectiveness of COVID-19 travel bans, both within and against mainland China. The project hinges on the Wuhan lockdown on January 23, when China restricted movements within the city of 11 million. The model charts how global and domestic commuters flowed before and after this turning point in the outbreak, combining high-resolution population data and disease-tracking algorithms tailored to the ongoing epidemic.

“Our model is constantly updated and recalibrated using new information and the updated interventions that different countries are implementing,” Chinazzi says. The result offers a readout on the effectiveness of these travel restrictions, and so far, the verdict is mixed.

First, China’s lockdown of Wuhan likely arrived too late; the model predicts that the novel coronavirus had already established footholds in other major Chinese cities by January 23. That means mainland China was likely already exporting coronavirus cases through other travel hubs, with the model pointing to Shanghai, Beijing, Shenzhen, Guangzhou, and Kunming as the highest-ranked sources.

---

The lab’s predictions may also explain why the outbreak continues to thrive in certain places, like Japan and South Korea. Rather than lower the odds of transmission, the Wuhan lockdown increased the risk for coronavirus importations for these two countries, which only issued partial transportation bans. Travelers from Wuhan and Hubei Province were blocked, while visitors from other parts of mainland China could still enter.
Overall, the model suggests that the Wuhan lockdown only delayed the global progression of the epidemic by three to five days. Such delays aren’t worthless, given that they provide precious time to coordinate a response. But their limited effectiveness should be no surprise, considering research conducted on the last two decades’ worth of outbreaks.

“There is not a lot of evidence that a travel ban would completely eliminate the risk of an infectious disease spreading in the long term,” says Nicole Errett, a lecturer at University of Washington School of Public Health and a former special assistant at the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.

In the latest issue of the Journal of Emergency Management, Errett and two colleagues reviewed past travel bans implemented for Ebola and SARS, and they reported that most were only effective in the short term. Similar investigations for influenza found that travel bans could delay the spread of epidemics by one week to two months, but the overall incidence of the disease only dropped by 3 percent.

**Does airport screening help?**

Meanwhile, the methods for spotting the disease among people on the move aren’t foolproof. Take, for example, the temperature guns that you see pointed at people’s foreheads at airport customs and border checkpoints. On average, those devices are only 70 percent effective at detecting fevers, meaning about one of every four people with elevated body temperatures goes unnoticed.

“Travelers screening is not some kind of firewall that will absolutely protect from having cases imported into whatever area you're trying to defend,” says Jamie Lloyd-Smith, an infectious disease ecologist at UCLA. “This is not because [the screening] is being done poorly, and it’s not because the people who are in charge are being lazy.”

In an interview with The Beijing News on Wednesday, Zhao Jianping, head of a team working to contain the outbreak in Hubei,  said one of his patients had been discharged from hospital after two laboratory tests proved negative. But several days later the patient came down with a fever, and this time tested positive again.“This is dangerous. Where do you put those patients? You cannot send them home because they might infect others, but you cannot put them in hospital as resources are stretched,” Zhao told Southern People Weekly on Thursday.
 
Chinese experts have previously warned that recovered patients can become infected a second time, and it was not clear whether this had been the case with Zhao’s patient.
In the Canadian province of Ontario the first two cases of Covid-19 have seen the patients continue to give positive test results after recovering, according to The Star newspaper.
 
Kevin Patterson, a Canadian doctor and writer, said that in some cases patients who had recovered from illnesses like Ebola or tuberculosis continued to carry traces of the virus or bacteria in their bodies. But he said these cases were not contagious.
Questions have also been raised about the reliability of the nucleic acid tests used to confirm the presence of the coronavirus.Those organisms are dead because the treatment has killed them,” he said. “And if you put [the organism] in a culture dish, you cannot grow the organism.”
 
He continued: “Maybe viral particles and viral DNAs are detected but it’s not infectious … If it [coronavirus] is contagious, it will be unusual.”

He said “when they [the patients] recovered, it means their bodies have defeated the virus,” so in theory the risk of contagion should be low.Benjamin Cowling, head of the division of epidemiology and biostatistics at Hong Kong University, said the best way to assess the risk was to confirm whether the coronavirus found in recovered patients was dead.

Cowling also said that even if some of those patients did prove to be infectious, it would be important to monitor how frequently it occurred.
 
He believes such cases would be a “small fraction” of the total and “may not make a big difference to control measures”.
He also said that once people are allowed to move freely in China again, “then we’ll have the potential for transmission” 

A professor of immunology in Beijing said it was important to check the quality of the tests to exclude the possibility that some test kits have been polluted. “If there is a little bit of pollution inside, it will have false positive as a result,” he said. He requested anonymity because he was not allowed to talk to the media."

2020-02-21,G4WDS,askphilosophy,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/askphilosophy/comments/f74nqm/appeals_to_authority/fic3q5l/,"That's an interesting question. It does seem to me like people are far more willing to accept lesser authorities in the fields of economics/politics (or to believe that their own views are just as legitimate as those of educated scholars). I don't know why this is the case, as you are right in saying that people are far more willing to accept authority in the medical context. My hypothesis is that they do so because the consequences are less dire. If you have a medical problem, and make the wrong decision regarding who to listen to, you can die. There are less immediate impacts in the political/economic contexts. You can believe that Alex Jones is a legitimate authority without the world immediately crumbling around you. I think it also has to do with identity politics. People associate politics with their identities, and view an attack on their politics as an attack on their selves. This need to preserve your identity of who you are (by staking your self identity on your ""values"") may override the compelling reasons to listen to an educated person. I.e., the Trump supporter in the South who knows nothing of economics believing that her limited understanding trumps that of a Princeton professor's. 

Finally, I think it has to do with the nature of science versus the nature of the social sciences. Take the idea of disagreement in the medical verse political contexts. If two doctors disagree as to what patient X has, there is - nevertheless - one correct answer. For example, if a patient presents with the cold but has the coronavirus. One might say cold; the other corona, but eventually, one will be proven right and the other wrong. There is an objective ""truth"" to be discovered. 

In the social sciences, there is rarely an objective ""truth"" like there is in math or science. Politics or political philosophy is not like solving a math problem, where if you work long enough, you'll eventually come to an answer that is objectively better than all others because it is more ""true."" 

I don't think that an appeal to authority in the medicine or science context is ""better"" than an appeal to authority in the social sciences context. From a purely logical standpoint, they're equally flawed. I think people are far more likely to be okay with appeals to authority in the medicinal context, however, for the reasons I've listed above. I don't think that you can approach things from a viewpoint of what contexts allow for appeals to authority, since whether people are more willing to accept an appeal to authority does not mean that an appeal to authority is more justified in one scenario or the other. Just because people are more willing to accept a doctor's opinion over a philosopher's does not mean that appeals to authority in the former are ""better"" than appeals to authority in the latter. In the argumentative context, they're both flawed arguments. What people are prone to do, and what people should do, are not the same thing."

All of those people are presumably in quarantine, but let's assume that they each passed it on to 2 more people, so 70 non-quarantined people. That's a one in 5 *million* risk per person, or a .00002% chance, so astronomically low. You said that you are a college student, so even if you do get coronavirus, it will likely be nothing worse than a bad flu, and you would have almost no risk of dying from it. I'm not going to tell you what to do with those odds, but if I were you, I would go on the plane, and I would be a lot more worried about the flu, which has infected 13 million people so far this flu season."

Only severe or complex cases (comorbidities and such) are tested serologically. I'm not advocating OP's hypothesis by any means though.

That being said, the coronavirus could easily be diagnosed as the flu, especially without specific testing protocols in place. It's only when hospitals would see a disproportional flu death rate that they might suspect something else going on. 

Seeing as how weeks can pass between the advent of symptoms and the ultimate perisihing of the patient, we might not notice those effects fof several weeks, if the coronavirus is spreading within the community at such a large scale. Don't forget, about 80% has mild symptoms."

I agree with you that below method as you describe is exactly what border control is doing right now. It's a joke. I work in Healthcare and the situation is slightly different from what it appears and for good reasons. However thinking that we will be 'safe' by not letting these students in is a joke. The cats been out the bag for a while now. 

""there is no chance that the students will all be ""quarantined"". They almost certainly won't even be tested for the virus, other than having their temperature checked (which means very little). They may be asked to perform a 14 day voluntary isolation, but that is incredibly unreliable. Who knows if any will actually follow it. "" 

Anyway if you think we are doing such a good job with border control containing it right now, clearly we should be able to manage quarantine measurements for a few thousand more students.

At least 34 people in the United States are infected with the new coronavirus spreading from China, federal health officials said on Friday.

Thirteen of the infections occurred in the country, and 21 in people returning from overseas.

More infections are expected among the people who were passengers aboard the Diamond Princess cruise and are currently in quarantine, Dr. Nancy Messonnier, director of the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, said at a news briefing.

Because they may have been in contact with infected people on the ship, “they are considered at high risk for infection,” Dr. Messonnier said. 
Ten other passengers from the Diamond Princess tested positive in Japan, but are not being counted among the infected yet, because the tests have not been confirmed by the C.D.C. However, they will likely be added to the case count, Dr. Messonnier said.

Several Americans remain critically ill with the infection in Japanese hospitals. They were among the passengers aboard the Diamond Princess cruise ship, which was overwhelmed with infections after it docked in Yokahama, Japan.

As of Friday, the coronavirus has infected 75,000 people, the vast majority in mainland China, and has killed 2,236.

“This new virus represents a tremendous public health threat,” Dr. Messonnier said.

I got swine flu when it hit when I was living back in the States and it was like getting a mild case of the flu. My doctor at the time did a test for it, told me I had it, told me to just wait it out at home until I got better and that was it. No one at work freaked out that I and a few other coworkers had it. It wasn’t a huge deal. 

The regular flu infects and kills far more people than the coronavirus. If you’re elderly or your immune system isn’t in good shape, then yes you should be more concerned. Otherwise, wash your hands often as you should be doing anyway and get on with life."

At least 34 people in the United States are infected with the new coronavirus spreading from China, federal health officials said on Friday.

Thirteen of the infections occurred in the country, and 21 in people returning from overseas.

More infections are expected among the people who were passengers aboard the Diamond Princess cruise and are currently in quarantine, Dr. Nancy Messonnier, director of the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, said at a news briefing.

Because they may have been in contact with infected people on the ship, “they are considered at high risk for infection,” Dr. Messonnier said. 
Ten other passengers from the Diamond Princess tested positive in Japan, but are not being counted among the infected yet, because the tests have not been confirmed by the C.D.C. However, they will likely be added to the case count, Dr. Messonnier said.

Several Americans remain critically ill with the infection in Japanese hospitals. They were among the passengers aboard the Diamond Princess cruise ship, which was overwhelmed with infections after it docked in Yokahama, Japan.

As of Friday, the coronavirus has infected 75,000 people, the vast majority in mainland China, and has killed 2,236.

“This new virus represents a tremendous public health threat,” Dr. Messonnier said.

A lot of people on TWTR who are veterans of trading they see this situation getting out of control and the shifts of the yield curves, reduced QE and Coronavirus global outlook is scaring everyone.

Trump of course calls them out as communists, socialists and evil power hungry people.

But Bloomy didn't believe any of that - the media had him convinced. And he would bring his common sense business attitudes and his huge checkbook and totally dominate.  But it didn't work - and it won't work.

The left is not the left of Bill Clinton - never mind JFK.  The left is about social justice - social justice is not really about justice at all - its about envy.  Some groups do far better then others and social justice plans to fix that.  The justice is the redistribution of wealth aka eating the rich.

What the media isn't telling people that one group that ABSOLUTELY DOMINATES are of course Jewish people.  Average income is somewhere around 150k.  Asians do pretty well to with like 80k.  So having a Jewish guy push Capitalism in the Democratic debate.

That's certifiable - but he had absolutely no clue.  It's what happened with Marianne Williamson as well.   Dude walked into a buzz saw.  I don't think his advertisements can net him victories.. 

Bernie is a bigger threat - Coronavirus tanks the economy. Bernie could swoop in with his communism.  It happened to Venezuela - it can happen here. We should not be too high and mighty about this.  They were warned - refugees from there all admit it - and they voted for Chavez anyway."

The lethality rate in china is presumed to be inaccurate, based on [WHO reports](https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/situation-reports) especially given they're currently estimating that between 15% and 45% of patients infected show no symptoms at all, while the majority of those who express symptoms have those of a common cold (Incidentally, Coronaviruses worldwide are the third most common cause of the ""Common cold"").

Outside of China that has been a single death (With a second being investigated) out of the roughly 700 CONFIRMED cases (~1000 suspected, not including those who - as mentioned above - have not shown symptoms). The one person who died was also confirmed to have pneumonia prior to infection, serving as a severe comorbidity.

The conclusion of all of this being that the annual flu is SUBSTANTIALLY more dangerous than the Wuhan virus, while also being more common and widespread. Yet we don't close down airports and cancel tournaments for flu season."

So we called our pediatrician, told him the travel history and symptoms, and they said ""go to XYZ ER, it's the designated one for our area, we're sending a referral now"".  We got there, and immediately were put in a negative pressure isolation room.  After 4 hours and 1000 dollar deposit, they told us we didn't qualify for testing, and he could go back to daycare as soon as his fever was down.  They ran a PCR respiratory panel, and he tested positive for human coronavirus, but they didn't know what strain, or at least didn't put it in the paperwork if they did.  4 days later we were back in the ER with him, but it was definitely not covid19 at that point.  I really wish we could have at least got tested though.  

Meanwhile a pediatrician in our city got back from Chongqing for chinese new year 2 weeks ago, and opened her practice less than a week after returning.  She's been visiting newborns in the hospital and everything.  I called the health department and asked if they could do anything, since I thought she was supposed to be asked to self isolate.

Same reaction was also in Western Ukraine - they builded barricades and ,as rumors claims, started digging trenches for some reasons."

And they have been pushing the markets up ever since September on liquidity injections.

I'd be surprised if these mofos didn't get people in China the second the rumors of the Coronavirus spread, to report the situation."
