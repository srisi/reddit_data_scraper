The WHO provided the entire world with an excellent test that worked at scale, and we made no effort to use it, resulting in the catastrophic [""lost month"" of February](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/28/us/testing-coronavirus-pandemic.html) in which we blinded ourselves as the virus spread to every corner of our nation.

We diagnosed our first case on [the same day as South Korea](https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/covid-19-discovered-us-south-korea/). Today 26,000 Americans now lie dead against only 222 South Koreans. They took testing seriously. We did not. Because after 3 years our executive branch is now designed entirely to insulate our head of state from news he does not want to hear, paralyzing decision making in a crisis.

The problem that created the catastrophe unfolding in the United States isn't the WHO. The problem is Americans who voted for Donald Trump."

>Paywalls, which require a paid subscription (or access via university enrollment), block access to scientific research and make a significant amount of money doing so. The paid publishing of these articles is a multibillion-dollar industry with top publishers boasting a profit margin between 35-40%.

>The articles are priced at a rate far too expensive for the average consumer, oftentimes upwards of $50 each. Schools and universities are forced to spend millions per year for subscriptions to these archives.
The cost of subscribing to academic research journals has risen by 300% above inflation since 1986, while academic library budgets have risen by only 79% over that time.

> What further aggravates this issue is that the public pays for much of this research in the first place. The federal government allocates $140 billion annually to research and development, meaning taxpayers are funding the research and then having to pay to view the findings.

>The dangers of this system have become increasingly apparent in recent weeks due to the rapid spread of COVID-19 and the immediate need for access to any and all coronavirus research that is available.

> Valuable information is being hidden from those in developing countries who desperately need access to every single resource available. 

>Seeing this as a monumental concern, a modern-day Robin Hood went to work to break through the paywalls and open up access to the bounty of coronavirus research online.

> One Reddit user who goes by the name of “Shrine” found it absurd that thousands of studies on the coronavirus were hidden behind paywalls and accessible only to those who could afford them.

>“I realized that there were people dying and that the death rate could be higher as a result of a lack of access to the articles,” explains Shrine, who preferred to remain anonymous.
“Any little piece of information that we can glean from previous scientific research on pandemics, epidemics, viruses, or vaccines has suddenly become relevant and agencies all over the world need access to all of these articles.”

>Shrine found and illegally downloaded more than 5,000 coronavirus research papers created from 1968 through 2020, using a website called “Sci-Hub.” He then released all of the articles on Reddit and within hours had thousands of seeders accessing the research.

> Attempting to make his vigilante operation legitimate, Shrine tried to appeal directly to the publishing companies themselves by creating a petition on Change.org asking them to remove the paywalls in order to help individuals and organizations research the coronavirus.

> The petition got hundreds of signatures within a few days and was successful in increasing the amount of coronavirus research papers available online from just a few thousand to over 32,000.

>Shrine’s efforts continued with a petition to the International Organization of Standards that effectively released paywalled information to help engineers build ventilators, as of April 9th.

>While Shrine’s Reddit post was obviously illegal, he believes the practice of hiding valuable information behind expensive paywalls is what’s really unethical. Recent history also points to the danger of these paywalls during times of crisis.

""National public health emergency management mechanisms should be activated with engagement of relevant ministries such as health, education, travel and tourism, public works, environment, social protection, and agriculture, to provide coordinated management of COVID-19 preparedness and response.""

The US declared a state of emergency on March 12.

Really the entire document is a fantastic read about how countries should prepare themselves for this disease. Should the US, or any country, have read this document and complied with the directions presented, this whole pandemic could have been minimised considerably.

But it's far easier to blame the WHO for our leaders shortcomings... cause we failed to look into this deep enough.)

**31 Dec 2019**

China reported [a cluster of cases of pneumonia](https://www.who.int/csr/don/05-january-2020-pneumonia-of-unkown-cause-china/en/) in Wuhan, Hubei Province. A novel coronavirus was eventually identified.

**1 January 2020**

WHO had set up the IMST (Incident Management Support Team) across the three levels of the organization: headquarters, regional headquarters and country level, putting the organization on an emergency footing for dealing with the outbreak.

**4  January 2020**

WHO [reported on social media](https://twitter.com/WHO/status/1213523866703814656?s=20) that there was a cluster of pneumonia cases – with no deaths – in Wuhan, Hubei province. 

**5 January 2020**

WHO published our [first Disease Outbreak News](https://www.who.int/csr/don/05-january-2020-pneumonia-of-unkown-cause-china/en/) on the new virus. This is a flagship technical publication to the scientific and public health community as well as global media. It contained a risk assessment and advice, and reported on what China had told the organization about the status of patients and the public health response on the cluster of pneumonia cases in Wuhan.

**10 January 2020**

WHO issued a comprehensive package of technical guidance online with advice to all countries on how to detect, test and manage potential cases, based on what was known about the virus at the time. This guidance was shared with WHO's regional emergency directors to share with WHO representatives in countries. 

Based on experience with SARS and MERS and known modes of transmission of respiratory viruses, infection and prevention control guidance were published to protect health workers recommending droplet and contact precautions when caring for patients, and airborne precautions for aerosol generating procedures conducted by health workers.

**12 January 2020**

China publicly [shared](https://www.who.int/csr/don/12-january-2020-novel-coronavirus-china/en/) the genetic sequence of COVID-19. 

**13 January 2020**

Officials confirm a case of [COVID-19 in Thailand](https://www.who.int/news-room/detail/13-01-2020-who-statement-on-novel-coronavirus-in-thailand), the first recorded case outside of China.  

**14 January 2020**

WHO's technical lead for the response noted in a press briefing there may have been limited human-to-human transmission of the coronavirus (in the 41 confirmed cases), mainly through family members, and that there was a risk of a possible wider outbreak. The lead also said that human-to-human transmission would not be surprising given our experience with SARS, MERS and other respiratory pathogens.  

**20-21 January 2020**

WHO experts from its China and Western Pacific regional offices conducted a brief field visit to Wuhan.

**22 January 2020**

WHO mission to China issued a [statement](https://www.who.int/china/news/detail/22-01-2020-field-visit-wuhan-china-jan-2020) saying that there was evidence of human-to-human transmission in Wuhan but more investigation was needed to understand the full extent of transmission.

**22- 23 January 2020**

The WHO Director- General [convened](https://www.who.int/news-room/detail/23-01-2020-statement-on-the-meeting-of-the-international-health-regulations-(2005)-emergency-committee-regarding-the-outbreak-of-novel-coronavirus-(2019-ncov)) an Emergency Committee (EC) under the International Health Regulations (IHR 2005) to assess whether the outbreak constituted a public health emergency of international concern. The independent members from around the world could not reach a consensus based on the evidence available at the time. They asked to be reconvened within 10 days after receiving more information.

**28 January 2020**

A senior WHO delegation led by the Director-General [travelled to Beijing to meet China’s leadership](https://www.who.int/news-room/detail/28-01-2020-who-china-leaders-discuss-next-steps-in-battle-against-coronavirus-outbreak), learn more about China’s response, and to offer any technical assistance. 

While in Beijing, Dr. Tedros agreed with Chinese government leaders that an international team of leading scientists would travel to China on a mission to better understand the context, the overall response, and exchange information and experience.

**30 January 2020**

The WHO Director-General reconvened the Emergency Committee (EC). This was earlier than the 10-day period and only two days after the first reports of limited human-to-human transmission were reported outside China. This time, the EC reached consensus and advised the Director-General that the outbreak constituted a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC). The Director-General accepted the recommendation and declared the novel coronavirus outbreak (2019-nCoV) a PHEIC. This is the 6th time WHO has declared a PHEIC since the International Health Regulations (IHR) came into force in 2005.

**3 February 2020** 

WHO releases the international community's [Strategic Preparedness and Response Plan](https://www.who.int/publications-detail/strategic-preparedness-and-response-plan-for-the-new-coronavirus) to help protect states with weaker health systems. 

**11-12 February 2020**

WHO convened a [Research and Innovation Forum](https://www.who.int/news-room/detail/12-02-2020-world-experts-and-funders-set-priorities-for-covid-19-research) on COVID-19, attended by more than 400 experts and funders from around the world, which included presentations by George Gao, Director General of China CDC, and Zunyou Wu, China CDC's chief epidemiologist. 

**16-24 February 2020**

The WHO-China Joint mission, which included experts from Canada, Germany, Japan, Nigeria, Republic of Korea, Russia, Singapore and the US (CDC, NIH) spent time in Beijing and also travelled to Wuhan and two other cities.

(Remember, the US had 53 cases on 25 Feb, none of the below reccomendations were carried out by Trump.)

In the report, the WHO proposes the following:

**For countries with imported cases and/or outbreaks of COVID-19**

1. Immediately activate the highest level of national Response Management protocols to ensure the all-of-government and all-of-society approach needed to contain COVID-19 with non-pharmaceutical public health measures;
2. Prioritize active, exhaustive case finding and immediate testing and isolation, painstaking contact tracing and rigorous quarantine of close contacts;
3. Fully educate the general public on the seriousness of COVID-19 and their role in preventing its spread;
4. Immediately expand surveillance to detect COVID-19 transmission chains, by testing all patients with atypical pneumonias, conducting screening in some patients with upper respiratory illnesses and/or recent COVID-19 exposure, and adding testing for the COVID-19 virus to existing surveillance systems (e.g. systems for influenza-like-illness and SARI); and
5. Conduct multi-sector scenario planning and simulations for the deployment of even more stringent measures to interrupt transmission chains as needed (e.g. the suspension of large-scale gatherings and the closure of schools and workplaces).

**For uninfected countries**

1. Prepare to immediately activate the highest level of emergency response mechanisms to trigger the all-of-government and all-of society approach that is essential for early containment of a COVID-19 outbreak;
2. Rapidly test national preparedness plans in light of new knowledge on the effectiveness of non-pharmaceutical measures against COVID-19; incorporate rapid detection, largescale case isolation and respiratory support capacities, and rigorous contact tracing and management in national COVID-19 readiness and response plans and capacities;
3. Immediately enhance surveillance for COVID-19 as rapid detection is crucial to containing spread; consider testing all patients with atypical pneumonia for the COVID-19 virus, and adding testing for the virus to existing influenza surveillance systems;
4. Begin now to enforce rigorous application of infection prevention and control measures in all healthcare facilities, especially in emergency departments and outpatient clinics, as this is where COVID-19 will enter the health system; and
5. Rapidly assess the general population’s understanding of COVID-19, adjust national health promotion materials and activities accordingly, and engage clinical champions to communicate with the media.

People, I'm not comparing total tests done. It doesn't mean anything since the US have one of the higher populations combined with most tests done. The whole point about all of this is that the US is still heavily afflicted like many other countries (absolutely not THE most afflicted, but still heavily so) and Trump tries to make it sound like what they have done is the absolute best outcome possible.

In December when doctors here heard about the rumours of an unknown type of pneumonia in Wuhan, our government sent a team over to investigate. The team was not allowed to go close to the hospital where the patients were and was painted a pretty picture. Knowing China too well,  our government figured something was about to go down. They started screening flight passengers arriving from Wuhan for 26 diseases including SARS and MERS. In January, Taiwan banned all flights from Wuhan and later all flights from China were banned in February.

The government also bought off all mask manufacturing lines and purchased more machines and supplies to ramp up mask production. The masks are rationed out to the residents. Our mask production went from 3 million per day to 10 million, now at 15 million and our goal is 20 million. The residents now can purchase 9 masks per fortnight at the price of 0.17 USD each. We also keep the information transparent to the public with the government briefing at press conference daily. Also, everyone that enters Taiwan must do a mandatory 14 day quarantine and would be fined big time for breaching the order. Restaurants, schools and commercial buildings now have checkpoints for temperatures and people with a fever would be denied entry.

Taiwan reacted aggressively because we had very limited information. When we had SARS outbreak in 2003, there wasn't much information and help sent to us as we were (and still are) not a member of WHO. The lack of information had our people killed. That's how we learned to be more prepared for the next pandemic. This time, we were also given very little information (for the same reason), but we knew we had to react quick and prepare for the worst so we don't repeat the sad history.

For context: I met my s/o in the middle of my PhD and we dated for the last \~2 years of my PhD. When I got a postdoc in another city, she moved with me, and we're still going strong two years later.

Having a non-academic s/o has helped me maintain a much healthier work-life balance than I see of many of my colleagues that are (single or) in relationships with other academics. She works the same hours every day, which more-or-less forces me to work the same hours every day, too. We wake up, leave for work, come home and go to bed at the same times. In the evenings we have dinner together and relax, or go out and see friends, or whatever. (I mean normally, not during the coronavirus pandemic, of course.)

I'm much more productive in the daytime, and much more relaxed in the evenings, and I sleep much better, than before we started dating. It's a lot harder to be suckered into staying up all night working on research, responding to emails, etc., when you're spending time with your non-academic s/o who wants to do normal-person-things with you.

Another benefit is that what binds us is non-work related, which is great therapy. When I'm stressed about research/teaching/all the other academic b/s, I can put it all to rest and just enjoy my time with her.

I do want to pick up on something you said:

>I still worry that grad school will consume me & I will not have any time for him & our relationship

If you don't have time for your relationship, either (1) you should not be in your relationship, or (2) you should not be in academia.

Despite what people like to say, it *is* possible to be successful in academia and maintain a healthy relationship. You just have to avoid being consumed by it, and accept that you might not achieve perfection but you can still do very well."

1. Guangzhou is home to the largest migrant African population in China.
2. There are lots of negative stereotypes associated with Africans in Guangzhou (also in China as a whole but these stereotypes are magnified in Guangzhou) - such as the fact that they're all illegal immigrants who spread HIV / AIDs and commit crime. Imo, there actually used to be a lot of illegal African migrants in Guangzhou but this is no longer an issue after local immigration clampdowns. The HIV/AIDs rumors were bullshit from the beginning and it didn't help that there were low quality /lame viral videos of African migrants boasting about having sex with Chinese people while being HIV positive. If you thought fake news was a problem in Western countries, wait until you're in China and see the colossal amount of fake shit being propagated EVERYWHERE.
3. The perception of Africans being illegal immigrants matters because illegal immigrants cannot get tested for coronavirus ( or don't want to for fear of being deported). Guangzhou has implemented a few initiatives to encourage people to get tested, which helps with reopening the economy in a safe-ish manner (e.g. landlords have been instructed to check prospective tenants coronavirus status; something that illegal immigrants likely won't have). While good in its intention, this has a disproportionate impact on black people who are perceived to be illegal immigrants without a negative coronavirus status)

The coronavirus outbreak brought out the worst in Guangzhou people and magnified their hate of black people, **which was already there.** Black people already had a plethora of issues navigating life in Guangzhou; businesses just tacked on ""coronavirus"" as a reason to not serve black people.

Black people face discrimination all over China, but it's definitely a magnitude higher in Guangzhou.

I want to point out that I'm not justifying this kind of behavior, I'm just providing a bit of background.

I also want to point out that comments such as ""China is the most racist country ever"" are not really meaningful."

The WHO =/= just coronavirus response. They haven't handled that particularly well, but it's such a small fraction of what they do. Where the WHO excels is in providing health services and coordination to lower income countries. They lead the way in things like the fight against HIV, eradication of polio, aiding nations with food security, they coordinated the recent ebola outbreak efforts, etc. etc.

I agree that their messaging regarding China has been very poor, but they always err on the side of not criticizing any powerful country. They avoid criticizing America just as much as China. That's something they should fix. But to focus on this one issue and pretend that it defines the entire organization is stupid. They do so much good in the world that can't be done without a unified international body. 

Final point, to blame the WHO for the coronavirus outbreak in the States is insane. The States has their own intelligence gathering resources and Trump & co were being warned about this months ago and they did absolutely nothing. This is just an attempt to deflect blame.

tidr: Singapore, like most of the world, probably grossly **underestimated the effects of asymptomatic transmission of COVID-19**. 

Long version:

As Singapore's response is developed from the experience of combating SARS, there was an **inherent weakness** of our COVID-19 response - **effects of asymptomatic transmission of COVID-19**.

Like many said, the number of new cases in early March was low (average of 10.375 from 6 Mar to 13 Mar), indicating the local transmission was relatively under control. This changed when many residents/ citizens returned to Singapore.

Based on experience with SARS, **Singapore is focused on symptomatic carriers**, so we had the measures such as contact tracing, QO (quarantine orders), SHN (stay home notice), PHCP (For **people showing respiratory symptoms** (like a cough, runny nose or fever) ), our mask-wearing policy (**symptomatic people are already told to wear mask then**).

As people pointed out, the SHN at that time was not strictly enforced, but, note that SHN is **ONLY for asymptomatic  people**. People with **WITH SYMPTOMS** such as fever **would have been treated differently** \- probably given the swab test. Thus, the “weakness” in SHN enforcement probably also stem from **underestimation of asymptomatic transmission**.

Countries like China did better than us during this period because their measures (full lockdown and full-mask-wearing policy) are effective in controlling **asymptomatic transmission**.

This list goes on if we were to nitpick.

From googling, it isn't clear when SG raised caution against asymptomatic transmission.

[\[30 Jan\] Medical Paper about Asymptomatic Transmission of COVID19](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMc2001468)

Thus, I think Singapore was already not on the perfect path right from the start. Things worked out when COVID-19 behaved similar to SARS, and we could contain/delay its transmission despite it bring a new and unknown virus. However, as the differences in characteristics of COVID-19 and SARS are identified (**extent of asymptomatic transmission**), Singapore (and probably most of the world) was not able to adapt the virus-containment response rapidly, resulting in today's situation.

I like to conclude by reminding everyone, including myself, that most of us are keyboard warriors to a large extent. When we look at things from hindsight, we should not be arrogant to think that we would have come up with a better response than what our govt did and did not do. The very fact that we have NOT exceed our healthcare capacity at this moment is already a blessing.

1. Microscopic organisms are not just small, they're extremely light as well. Because of this, the viscosity of the medium they're in (e.g. water) provides much more resistance, which in turn can give them a lot of maneuverability, as well as the ability to stay relatively stationary. Think about the air resistance you feel when you wave your hand through the air, and imagine how that must feel to a fly. This can make it look like they are ""on"" something when you look at them under a microscope, when really they're just floating around as you'd expect.
2. We see the world a particular way because ... well, that's the only way we see it under normal circumstances! When you zoom in using a microscope, you aren't seeing a ""smaller version of Earth for the micro organisms,"" you're just seeing the same planet you've always seen from a different perspective. There is a lot of life and fine detail going on at microscopic scales that you and I are completely oblivious to during our day-to-day life. If you were to zoom in further (using, say, an electron microscope instead of a light microscope) you would see a completely different perspective filled with things like viruses. If you've seen pictures of the novel coronavirus in the news, those little viral particles are much, much smaller than the cells they infect."

Our luck was that we caught the first few cases early before there was widespread transmission, thus the reactive measures of aggressive contact tracing and quarantine of close contacts worked to slow down community transmission. But whilst we managed to keep the spread minimal, it was always spreading around the country, with cases trickling in every day and new clusters popping up as old ones 'died off'. There was a Bangladeshi worker early on who was living in a dorm that caught the virus but did not seem to have spread it. Luck or strategy? Did they not set alarm bells off in the heads of our scholars? I had ICT when Dorscon changed to Orange and specifically wrote into Mindef highlighting the dangers of a possible mass transmission risk due to staying-in conditions in the NS bunks, but they decided to gamble and decided to carry on with the stay-in program. But all it takes is one gamble to go wrong, and it finally did in our foreign worker dormitories.

https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/health/coronavirus-foreign-workers-at-kaki-bukit-dormitory-told-to-stay-away-from-work-on

When our luck turned sour, when infected carriers eventually spread to big clusters, when imported carriers started coming back to Singapore, our reactive measures of contact tracing proved to be too little too late. SAF is very lucky that it has not recorded any clusters because what is happening to the foreign worker dormitories could very well have happened in the SAF camps (they finally recognised the issue and shut down non-essential ICT after the situation had already got out of control). The government mistook luck for strategy, and when our luck ran out, were caught with their pants down.

Why have other countries handled it better than ours? Their leaders did not mistake luck for strategy, did not insist on simply following the ten-year-series-SARS playbook, anticipated the possibility of mild or asymptomatic spread, encouraged mask wearing, implemented social distancing, etc, looked at how seriously China was dealing with the situation and chose to play it safer instead of gambling with 'measured responses', in order to prevent the situation from escalating out of control. In Singapore, our leaders waited until the situation already escalated out of control before panicking, and due to how severe the situation has already gotten, are now forced to implement harsher lockdown measures than other countries that took a more proactive and vigilant attitude right from the start.

Its just a very typical example of beginner's luck; whereby the beginner mistakes his luck for strategic genius. But in this gamble, the chips at stake is the entire country's economy and healthcare system. 

If the government had treated it and continued to treat it seriously from the start, I wouldn't be so harsh on them if the situation spiraled out of control despite their attempts to stop it. But the fact is, as late as March 2, PM Lee was encouraging Singaporeans to go for staycations and visiting local attractions, which is a glaringly obvious indication that the entire leadership were being extremely complacent. I'm not asking for them to be hindsight geniuses, but where did they ever show a hint of foresight, of anticipating problems before they happened, or even simply just looking at how seriously China was dealing with the outbreak and thinking 'hmm, maybe we ought to take it more seriously too instead of thinking everything can be business as usual'?"

 *In mid-January, the WHO said that there was no clear evidence (conducted by the Chinese authorities) of human to human transmission -*

And...? Do you have evidence that there was clear evidence at the time?

 *At the end of Jan, WHO Director advises not to close borders -* 

And he was right. South Korea never shut their borders. They tested, traced and quarantined as per the WHO plan. How many have died there again? \~200. The US, which ignored the WHO's advice and plan (released Feb 3  [https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/srp-04022020.pdf](https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/srp-04022020.pdf) ) and opted not to use their recipe for testing, instead opting for a bungled CDC test., has over 100x that number of deaths. The US shut borders to China on Feb 1. As did Italy actually. Ironic. So who was right?

 *Late Feb - WHO says outbreak in China has peaked*  

Which was correct as per the link below:

 [https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/country/china/](https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/country/china/) 

 *The WHO also told us* [*""There is no specific evidence to suggest that the wearing of masks by the mass population has any potential benefit. In fact, there's some evidence to suggest the opposite in the misuse of wearing a mask properly or fitting it properly,"" Dr. Mike Ryan, executive director of the WHO health emergencies program*](https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/30/world/coronavirus-who-masks-recommendation-trnd/index.html) *- and now are recommending the complete opposite.* 

This was their only bungle to be honest, but it's also one nearly every EU, US and Canadian health authority also made, perhaps because PPE was so short to them. Asian countries knew there was no specific evidence to support wearing masks for Covid-19, but common sense prevailed there AND they had the PPE. It is true that misusing a mask can cause you to be infected, however, the main form of transmission is respiratory droplets and exhalations even. What was not known earlier on was the prevalence of asymptomatic spread. Asian countries had PPE to spare so they had no qualms with recommending everyone wear one anyway. Here, we were scared of hoarding and theft that would take PPE away from healthcare workers, both of which did happen anyway."

2020-04-14,kokoniqq,China_Flu,81,https://www.reddit.com/r/China_Flu/comments/g147sh/state_department_cables_warned_of_safety_issues/fnddb1s/,"Sources familiar with the cables said they were meant to sound an alarm about the grave safety concerns at the WIV lab, especially regarding its work with bat coronaviruses. The embassy officials were calling for more U.S. attention to this lab and more support for it, to help it fix its problems.

“The cable was a warning shot,” one U.S. official said. “They were begging people to pay attention to what was going on.”

No extra assistance to the labs was provided by the U.S. government in response to these cables. The cables began to circulate again inside the administration over the past two months as officials debated whether the lab could be the origin of the pandemic and what the implications would be for the U.S. pandemic response and relations with China.

Inside the Trump administration, many national security officials have long suspected either the WIV or the Wuhan Center for Disease Control and Prevention lab was the source of the novel coronavirus outbreak.[ According to](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/11/us/politics/coronavirus-trump-response.html?action=click&module=Top%20Stories&pgtype=Homepage) the New York Times, the intelligence community has provided no evidence to confirm this. But one senior administration official told me that the cables provide one more piece of evidence to support the possibility that the pandemic is the result of a lab accident in Wuhan.

“The idea that is was just a totally natural occurrence is circumstantial. The evidence it leaked from the lab is circumstantial. Right now, the ledger on the side of it leaking from the lab is packed with bullet points and there’s almost nothing on the other side,” the official said.

As my colleague David Ignatius[ noted](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/global-opinions/how-did-covid-19-begin-its-initial-origin-story-is-shaky/2020/04/02/1475d488-7521-11ea-87da-77a8136c1a6d_story.html?tid=lk_inline_manual_30&itid=lk_inline_manual_30), the Chinese government’s original story — that the virus emerged from a seafood market in Wuhan — is shaky. Research by Chinese experts published in[ the Lancet](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(20)30183-5/fulltext#bib35) in January showed the first known patient, identified on Dec. 1, had no connection to the market, nor did more than one-third of the cases in the first large cluster. Also, the market didn’t sell bats.

Shi and[ other WIV researchers](https://www.globaltimes.cn/content/1179908.shtml) have[ categorically denied](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/how-chinas-bat-woman-hunted-down-viruses-from-sars-to-the-new-coronavirus1/) this lab was the origin for the novel coronavirus. On Feb. 3, her team was the first to[ publicly report](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2012-7) the virus known as 2019-nCoV was a bat-derived coronavirus.

The Chinese government, meanwhile, has put a total lockdown on information related to the virus origins. Beijing has yet to provide U.S. experts with samples of the novel coronavirus collected from the earliest cases. The Shanghai lab that published the novel coronavirus genome on Jan. 11 was quickly shut down by authorities for “rectification.” Several of the[ doctors and journalists](https://twitter.com/BrendanCarrFCC/status/1248442812414201866) who reported on the spread early on have disappeared.

On Feb. 14, Chinese President Xi Jinping[ called for](https://www.fmprc.gov.cn/mfa_eng/zxxx_662805/t1745270.shtml) a new biosecurity law to be accelerated. On Wednesday,[ CNN reported](https://www.cnn.com/2020/04/12/asia/china-coronavirus-research-restrictions-intl-hnk/index.html) the Chinese government has placed severe restrictions requiring approval before any research institution publishes anything on the origin of the novel coronavirus.

The origin story is not just about blame. It’s crucial to understanding how the novel coronavirus pandemic started because that informs how to prevent the next one. The Chinese government must be transparent and answer the questions about the Wuhan labs because they are vital to our scientific understanding of the virus, said Xiao.

The Coronavirus Has Already Made Us Poorer for Years to Come

Matthew C. Klein
8-10 minutes

Whatever happens next, the events of the past six weeks will scar the U.S. economy well into the 2030s, if not beyond.

The Federal Reserve, Congress, and the U.S. Treasury may believe they have acted quickly and decisively to support the economy, but they were nevertheless too slow to prevent trillions of dollars of lasting damage. Tens of millions of Americans are already paying the price, and they will continue to do so for a long time.

Between March 15 and April 4, a staggering 16.8 million Americans filed initial claims for unemployment insurance benefits. Based on the historical relationship between the number of Americans receiving unemployment benefits and the level of the joblessness, the unemployment rate was probably around 13% by the end of March and perhaps close to 20% by the end of last week. That would be comparable to the Great Depression.

The Great DisasterInitial and continuing claims suggest theunemployment rate may already be 20%.Weekly dataSources: Bureau of Labor Statistics; U.S.Employment and Training Administration; Barron'scalculations

%Unemployment rate (actual)

Modeled from relationship betweencontinuing claims and unemployment rate1980’95’1001020

As stark as these numbers are, they nevertheless understate the magnitude of the job losses that have already occurred, because state unemployment offices have often been unable to handle the unprecedented volume of claims. The true extent of the damage will not be visible in the data until the backlogs are processed.

The entire economy has been brutalized. Restaurants, bars, and hotels have been hit especially hard, but so has nearly every other sector. The Texas Workforce Commission, for example, highlighted layoffs in a variety of sectors including manufacturing, construction, health care, retail, scientific research, agriculture, and warehousing. Preventing those job losses should have been the government’s first priority, but it was too slow. This will have lasting effects.

Mortgage data company Black Knight estimates unemployment above 20% would generate delinquencies comparable to the financial crisis, even after accounting for improvements in lending standards and borrower characteristics. Forbearance could keep down defaults for a few months, but after that it will depend on the vigor of the recovery.

Looking a bit further out, economists have repeatedly found that laid-off workers eventually lose about 2½ years of income over the rest of their professional lives through a combination of lower wages and lower employment. If the number of unemployed Americans ends up rising by 30 million people from February levels, for example—which would be consistent with a peak unemployment rate of about 22%—then that would end up costing the economy the equivalent of 75 million work-years over the next two decades.

That would be equivalent to as much as $4 trillion in today’s dollars, or a little more than 18% of U.S. gross domestic product. Even if unemployment peaks at a much lower level and even if the people losing their jobs earn far less than the average American, the long-term economic cost of the job losses that have already occurred would still easily exceed $1.5 trillion of today’s dollars.

These are enormous sums, but they nevertheless understate the cost to workers. Economists have also found that workers in the beginning of their careers experience lasting harm from downturns even when they keep their jobs. The economist Till von Wachter of the University of California, Los Angeles, estimates there are at least 16 million young Americans who are exposed and that they will likely lose between 5%-10% of their income over the next decade.

In addition to unprecedented layoffs, America has suffered from a sharp drop in the formation of new businesses. While existing companies are often an important source of growth and innovation, the creation of new businesses is essential for competition and economic dynamism. The number of applications for businesses with a “high propensity of turning into businesses with payroll” tracked by the Census Bureau plunged in 2008 and only gradually began recovering in the past few years. That coincided with a sharp slowdown in U.S. productivity growth, in addition to elevated unemployment.

While most of the data on business applications are published quarterly with a lag, the Census recently began releasing weekly figures. The data from the end of March and the beginning of April suggest new business formation has already dropped by a quarter.

There will be at least two other lasting sources of damage from the coronavirus.

Businesses that had been optimized for a world without pandemic risk will likely adapt in ways that make them more resilient during crises but less efficient the rest of the time. That means higher inventories, less willingness to outsource operations to specialists, and fewer economies of scale from concentrating production and employment in specific offices or factories. If U.S. companies emulate the way Japanese companies manage operations, expect corporate cash hoarding at the expense of capital investment.

Households, too, can be expected to change behavior in the post-pandemic world. More money will be spent maintaining stockpiles of toilet paper and canned food, to say nothing of hand sanitizer and face masks, which means less money to spend on goods and services people want. At the same time, many people will choose to consume less overall in an attempt to build up a buffer of emergency savings. The financial crisis pushed the average American’s savings rate up from about 4% from 2000-06 to about 7.5% since 2012, and the increase looks even larger after accounting for changes in the level of interest rates and the ratio of wealth to income

In the past, extra spending was often financed by borrowing against housing. That’s not happening this time.

Continue reading
.

Less spending by American consumers will push American businesses to produce less, which means lower income and employment across the economy unless spending by the government and the rest of the world somehow picks up the slack.

To forestall this vicious cycle, policy makers must stop the virus and do whatever is necessary

It‘s possible to preserve businesses, jobs, and balance sheets while stopping the spread of the disease. But it will cost a lot more than $2 trillion.

to make sure the long-term economic damage isn’t even worse.

Jokes aside, I think like half of the APAC countries aren't testing that extensively as us (or HK/SK/NZ/AU, all in the top few spots as us). To be fair, comparing us to them (minus HK/SK), we might be doing better, given that NZ/AU/MY isn't as dense as us, which means that if they had the density, they might have done worse.

Comparatively, SK did better than us, as their high case per capita was mostly due to the ""explosion"" of cases from the megachurches (compare to our explosion in dorms). HK is the closest one we can compare to and it seems that strong memories of SARS really helped them (govt + people's attitudes) compared to us (we barely got hit by SARS in comparison, hence the general complacency of both parties).

India with 6 cases per million? Really? I doubt that it didn't take hold, given the conditions of slums (worse than our already crappy dorm conditions). Even with their lockdown, it will be as bad as us locking down our FWs in those dorm conditions (i.e. no way it's going to stop any spread).

Indonesia, the ""pray COVID-19 away"" nation + a significant number of imports to SG, has 13 cases per million? Why then we had a case (the deceased man, bless his heart) where the guy had to come to SG to confirm that his pneumonia is COVID-19? Of course that will mean that ID isn't even testing anything, meanwhile, we testing ALL pneumonia patients.

The only believable low cases per million is Taiwan (despite their low testing rates). Even China and Japan seems too low, given how China's numbers are as good as their GDP numbers (i.e. fake as hell) and Japan is now panicking (if really low, panic now for what sia?)."

They flew hither, thither, and yon, bringing a bit of COVID as souvenirs.

All humans are capable of spreading the virus, but the way the wealthy did it, and have responded to COVID, is hilarious because they imported it, used their money to pop a quick test, then retreated to their hovel with ""good bones"".

Somewhere in Connecticut, certain homeowners didn't want the city setting up a testing clinic in a particular area because it was too close to their neighborhood. They didn't want the unwashed, potentially COVID-infested masses getting tested down the street so they moved it.

They NIMBYized COVID testing.

You know who I feel bad for though? Any immigrant (or human, really) that had to uber them here or there or clean up after whatever messes they made *in their own house*.

Nobody claims the NHS is free - it isn't. It is free at the point of entry - meaning it does not cost you anything if you need access to its services at any given time. Of course it is funded by taxes. Any healthcare system is mostly funded by the people who need to use it, whether it is the American insurance system or the NHS.

>The Mail reported that at the start of this pandemic

The Daily Mail is not a reputable source of information, if the Mail is referencing something you should seek out the source where it obtained it.

>making it impossible for the NHS to cope and keep people alive.

Where are you getting your information from!? This is absolutely wrong - [as of April 10th, the NHS has 3197 patients in critical care beds with COVID-19.](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/slides-and-datasets-to-accompany-coronavirus-press-conference-10-april-2020)

This is well within the ability of the NHS to cope. It is coping and it is keeping people alive - successfully. If you have anything to indicate otherwise I would absolutely take it to the press, not Reddit.

>The healthcare is affordable and nearly everyone has health insurance  which pays for large costs for you. Now they actually have a good  healthcare system that I have experienced when my father (who lives  there) had a cardiac arrest and he has recovered incredibly and the response time of the first responders and ambulance are just  commendable. Could you say the same for the UK?

Germany's healthcare is brilliant - however just because Germany has a better healthcare system than the UK, doesn't mean the NHS is automatically rendered useless. One can be relatively better than the other without rendering the inferior system useless. I'm struggling to see your point.

>Okay granted Germany has had more testing... But that still supports my  argument that the German healthcare system managed to roll out and  deploy the tests much faster and better.

The NHS is not responsible for testing - the UK (and German) governments are. Yes the national healthcare system can be used to distribute and carry out these tests logistically, but it is not the resonsability of the NHS to test people. Germany and Korea have handled this outbreak better than most other countries, is it because of their testing strategies? Quite possibly yes (and most likely). Again what is your point? The NHS is not at fault, the UK government is.

>Wuhan Virus

You lose credability by calling it this - this was a politically charged statement from President Trump (whether he was right or wrong to call it that I don't really care and it is not relevant). The issue of whether China is to blame is largely irrelevant when it comes to dealing with the disease, bringing politics into it at this stage helps nobody.

>The NHS is an archaic system that was only intended as an emergency plan to help citizens after WWII and was never **intended** to be parmanent

I would love to know why you think this, and what you are using to justify it. I am not a historian but I am familiar with the evolution of the welfare state in Britain. Prof Christopher Ham's work Health Policy in Britain (Public Policy and Politics) (2009) is a great read and one I am familiar with - this absolutelty contradicts what you just said. I would place more credence in his work on the evolution of healthcare in Britain. The way in which healthcare is accessed has changed dramatically since the inception of the NHS. The system was never built to last forever at the time but the way in which people accessed healthcare was transformed because of the NHS. I cannot stress this point enough - at the time the NHS was unsustainable, but the entire system changed to accomodate the NHS and as such is sustainable. I suggest your read Prof. Ham's work as an entrypoint into the history and evolution of healthcare in Britian.

Your comment on government debt makes no mention of the defecit, you focus on the actual debt itself - which is largely irrelevant since the gilts are mostly held by pension funds in the UK. I don't believe you actually understand what it means for a government to be in debt, and what this actually means. Large numbers of debt is not a bad thing - I suggest you read up on what this means."

Higher skilled work, which often didn’t require personal contact, seemed more secure.

That’s not how it’s turning out.

A second wave of job loss is hitting those who thought they were safe. Businesses that set up employees to work from home are laying them off as sales plummet. Corporate lawyers are seeing jobs dry up. Government workers are being furloughed as state and city budgets are squeezed. And health-care workers not involved in fighting the pandemic are suffering.

The longer shutdowns continue, the bigger this second wave could become, risking a repeat of the deep and prolonged labor downturn that accompanied the 2007-09 recession.

The consensus of 57 economists surveyed this month by The Wall Street Journal is that 14.4 million jobs will be lost in the coming months, and the unemployment rate will rise to a record 13% in June, from a 50-year low of 3.5% in February. Already nearly 17 million Americans have sought unemployment benefits in the past three weeks, dwarfing any period of mass layoffs recorded since World War II.

Gregory Daco, chief U.S. economist of Oxford Economics, projects 27.9 million jobs will be lost, and industries beyond those ordered to close will account for 8 to 10 million, a level of job destruction on a par with the 2007-09 recession.

Oxford Economics, a U.K.-based forecasting and consulting firm, projects April’s jobs report, which will capture late-March layoffs, will show cuts to 3.4 million business-services workers, including lawyers, architects, consultants and advertising professionals, as well 1.5 million nonessential health-care workers and 100,000 information workers, including those working in the media and telecommunications.

“The virus shock does not discriminate across sectors as we initially thought,” Mr. Daco said.

Gary Cuozzo, owner of ISG Software Group in Wallingford, Conn., said in recent weeks he’s only received a few hundred dollars in payments from customers, including manufacturers, nonprofits and retailers, for which he hosts websites and builds applications. It’s not enough to pay the $3,000 electric bill for his servers and other equipment, much less pay his own salary.

“Customers who paid like clockwork for 10-plus years are suddenly late,” he said. “I’m burning through all the cash I have.”

Mr. Cuozzo stopped drawing a salary several weeks ago, and has filed for unemployment benefits. He’s essentially volunteering in an effort to keep his business afloat. He can work at home or alone at his business, but that’s of little help. “We have no software projects,” Mr. Cuozzo said. “Everything is on hold.”

Those employed in industries where working from home is feasible are facing widespread layoffs, said ZipRecruiter Chief Economist Julia Pollak. The recruiting site itself laid off more than 400 of its 1,200 full-time employees at the end of March.

A survey of visitors to the job-search site found 39% employed in business and professional services reported they were laid off, nearly the same rate as respondents in retail and wholesale trade. (Active job seekers are more likely to be laid off than the average American.) Among the respondents who still had jobs, many in white-collar industries said their hours were cut.

“Any company that had been planning to open a second location, that hired an architect, an office designer, and contractor—they’re not opening that location this year and those people now won’t have jobs. Any company planning to go public this year, that hired accountants, consultants, PR professionals—they’re laying off all those teams,” said Ms. Pollak.

Law firms have had to reduce staff and cut pay as courts are largely closed, settlement discussions are on pause and few new deals are being struck.

New York City-based Cadwalader, Wickersham & Taft LLP, a 400-attorney firm specializing in financial services, has reduced associate salaries by 25% and partners are not currently receiving compensation. Firms typically lay off attorneys only as a last resort, but another New York-based firm, Pryor Cashman LLP, is furloughing some associates. A spokesman said it expects to recall them soon.

Baker Donelson, a 700-lawyer firm with some 20 offices in the southeast and mid-Atlantic region, has reduced compensation for associates and staff by 20%. Timothy Lupinacci, the firm’s chairman and chief executive, said some clients have asked the firm to stop work or defer payments. “Law firms are not going to be top of the priority,” he said.

How we work from home isn’t the problem, said Karen Richardson, executive director at the National Association of Women Lawyers. “It’s: Will there be work for us to do?”

While the coronavirus has strained emergency services and intensive-care wards, hospitals have been cutting the elective surgical procedures and routine care that normally pay the bills in order to free up resources.

“In a sense we kind of sacrificed that revenue for a public-health interest,” said Daniel Philbin, a cardiologist at the New England Heart and Vascular Institute in Manchester, N.H. “The hospital systems really are facing an incredible crunch because of this—the longer the curve gets pushed out, the more they face difficult decisions about employment.”

Emily Hill thought her job as a dental assistant was safe, being in an in-demand field and employed through the military. She worked as a contractor at a dental clinic on Fort Hood in Texas.

“I always felt untouchable,” she said. “This really puts you in your place.”

When word of possible layoffs began to spread in mid-March, clinic staff expected a week or two without pay. Employees jokingly shared a PowerPoint presentation on how to file for unemployment benefits. That document became essential when she and her colleagues were informed they’d be without a job at least through June 19. The military had given stop-work orders to all nonessential contractors on base to limit any risk they might spread Covid-19.

“It went from no big deal to ‘Oh my gosh, what the hell am I going to do?’,” said Ms. Hill, who is now collecting $320 a week in unemployment benefits. She and other laid-off workers are likely to see larger payments when states distribute additional federal funds."

APRIL 13, 202010:48 PM

**Emergency room doctor, near death with coronavirus, saved with experimental treatment**


SEATTLE —  As critically ill, elderly patients streamed into his emergency room outside Seattle, Dr. Ryan Padgett quickly came to understand how deadly COVID-19 could be.

Of the first two dozen or so he saw, not a single one survived.


It took longer for Padgett and his colleagues at EvergreenHealth Medical Center — the first hospital in the country to treat multiple coronavirus patients — to learn how easily the disease could spread.


At first, the medical workers wore only surgical masks and gloves. Later, they were told to wear respirators and other gear, but the equipment was unfamiliar and Padgett couldn’t be certain he put it on and took it off correctly each time. 


A 6-foot-3, 250-pound former football star who played for Northwestern in the 1996 Rose Bowl, he wasn’t fazed by much. 


> “To worry about myself, as a 44-year-old healthy man, didn’t even cross my mind,” he said in an interview Monday.


But on March 12, with his wedding day two months away, Padgett became the patient.


Soon after being admitted to his own hospital with a fever, cough and difficulty breathing, he was placed on a ventilator. Five days after that, his lungs and kidneys were failing, his heart was in trouble, and doctors figured he had a day or so to live.


He owes his survival to an elite team of doctors who tried an experimental treatment pioneered in China and used on the sickest of all COVID-19 patients.


Lessons from his dramatic recovery could help doctors worldwide treat other extremely ill COVID-19 patients.

> “This is a movie-like save, it doesn’t happen in the real world often,” Padgett said. 

> “I was just a fortunate recipient of people who said, ‘We are not done. We are going to go into an experimental realm to try and save your life.’""


Once his colleagues at EvergreenHealth realized they had run out of options, they called Swedish Medical Center, one of two Seattle hospitals that has a machine known as an ECMO, which replaces the functions of the heart and lungs. 


But even after the hospital admitted him, doctors there had to figure out why he was so profoundly sick.


Based on the astronomical level of inflammation in his body and reports written by Chinese and Italian physicians who had treated the sickest COVID-19 patients, the doctors came to believe that it was not the disease itself killing him but his own immune system.


It had gone haywire and began to attack itself — a syndrome known as a “cytokine storm.” 

The immune system normally uses proteins called cytokines as weapons in fighting a disease. For unknown reasons in some COVID-19 patients, the immune system first fails to respond quickly enough and then floods the body with cytokines, destroying blood vessels and filling the lungs with fluid.


The doctors tried a drug called Actemra, which was designed to treat rheumatoid arthritis but also approved in 2017 to treat cytokine storms in cancer patients.

> “Our role was to quiet the storm,” said Dr. Samuel Youssef, a cardiac surgeon. 

“Dr. Padgett was able to clear the virus” once his immune system was back in balance.


Dr. Matt Hartman, a cardiologist, said that after four days on the immunosuppressive drug, supplemented by high-dose vitamin C and other therapies, the level of oxygen in Padgett’s blood improved dramatically. On March 23, doctors were able to take him off life support.

Four days later, they removed his breathing tube. He slowly came out of his sedated coma, at first imagining that he was in the top floor of the Space Needle converted to a COVID ward.

He soon became more conscious of his surroundings and had a FaceTime conversation with family members, who hadn’t been able to visit because of the hospital’s coronavirus lockdown.

> “It’s an incredible thing to survive a brush with death and not be able to see and be with your most loved people,” Padgett said.


> “And when everyone on staff who comes to see you has to be in a spacesuit, you just feel like this pariah. The isolation was pretty devastating at times.”


On March 31, balloons, gifts and letters came in the door. It was his 45th birthday. 

> “My birthday cake was an ice chip,” he said, recalling how grateful he was for his first sustenance by mouth.

As Padgett got to know Youssef, Hartman and other team members, they told him about a 33-year-old woman — a mother of three — who was in the hospital as well, also having experienced a cytokine storm. He saw the team’s excitement when they tried the approach on her, and she too recovered.


Padgett went home on April 5. He said Monday that he faced a long, slow recovery, physically and cognitively. He expects to be a better doctor, reminded how devastating an illness can be to a patient and a family.


Returning to the ER won’t be easy, he said.

> “But that’s my home, that’s what I do,” he said. “I enjoy that everyone-in-the-foxhole mentality.”

And one day before then, Padgett and his fiancee, Connie Kinsley, plan to have a small wedding ceremony with a few friends on their boat moored on a Seattle lake."

I don't think that we have working vaccines either for MERS-CoV or SARS-CoV, and they have been known for years. Surely a lot more resources is being dumped in a vaccine for the current SARS-CoV-2, but that by itself is no guarantee of a positive outcome.

> I don't think the difficulty of various obscure diseases will extend to one we have seen before in similar forms.

One of the ""obscure diseases"" that doesn't have a vaccine is AIDS / HIV, which has been researched since the 80s. In that case, however, at least we found an effective treatment in the mid-90s, after millions of deaths.

I really hope that I am wrong, but looking at history the prospects for vaccines and treatments popping overnight don't look that bright, except when the virus is from a type that has had vaccines since forever - like H1N1, which after all is a variant of the flu virus (Orthomyxoviridae, opposed to Coronaviridae)."
2020-04-14,ILiketurtles666,sandiego,59,https://www.reddit.com/r/sandiego/comments/g1chaj/california_will_look_at_6_factors_to_determine/fner5s6/,"California will look at six factors to determine when to loosen stay-at-home orders designed to slow the spread of the coronavirus, Gov. Gavin Newsom said Tuesday.

Newsom’s plan is designed to transition the state from the current stay-at-home orders that have ground much of the state’s economy to a halt to a point when there is a vaccine or widespread immunity to the virus.

“This cannot be a permanent state,” Newsom said. “These stay-at-home orders have a profound impact on the economy.”

Newsom says his team is looking at six key parameters to determine when to start reopening the state’s economy:

* Expanding testing

* Protecting high risk groups, including seniors, the medically vulnerable and people in facilities like nursing homes

* Ensuring hospitals have enough beds and supplies to care for patients

* Progress in developing treatments

* Ability of schools and businesses to support physical distancing

* Ability to decide when to reinstitute stay-at-home orders if needed


“The most important is our ability to expand our testing,” Newsom said.

The state must be able to test people who show symptoms and identify those in contact with people who test positive to determine how far the virus has spread, according to a presentation provided by Newsom’s office.

For now, testing in California is still limited because of supply shortages.

The second parameter is to protect high risk groups. That includes ensuring seniors and other vulnerable people are able to stay in their homes to avoid catching the disease, Newsom said. It also means ensuring that the state is able to identify and contain outbreaks in places like prisons and nursing homes.

The state’s hospitals also must also be prepared, Newsom said. They must have adequate numbers of beds, ventilators and personal protective gear to care for both COVID-19 patients and people with other medical problems, said Dr. Sonia Angell, who leads the state’s Public Health Department.

Allowing people to move more freely will allow the virus to spread more quickly. The state must be prepared to handle the increased demand expected as stay-at-home orders are eased, she said.

The reopening of the state will be less like flipping a light switch, and more like adjusting a dimmer, Newsom said.

Newsom has said he does not yet plan to announce a “pin-pointed date” for reopening. Instead, he’s focused what evidence state officials will need to see that danger from the virus has waned before they make changes to the orders.

“The question everyone has on our mind is when,” Newsom said. That will depend on the state’s ability to assess the questions laid out in the framework, he said.

As the state does ease up on its orders, the state will still have protections in place. People will be encouraged to wear masks, Angell said.

Restaurants will likely have disposable menus, Newsom said. Customers may have their temperatures checked at the door. Wait staff may wear masks. Schools may have staggered times to reduce contact among students.

“Normal it will not be, at least until we have herd immunity and we have a vaccine,” Newsom said.

“We will be driven by facts, we will be driven by evidence, we will be driven by science, we will be driven by our public health advisers,” Newsom said Monday, previewing Tuesday’s announcement.

Newsom said evidence that the state is slowing the spread of the coronavirus that causes COVID-19 convinced him this is the right time to start planning to reopen the economy. His announcement comes nearly a month after he issued an executive order directing non-essential businesses to close and residents to stay in their homes.

On Monday, Newsom said he will work with the governors of Oregon and Washington on a plan for the “incremental release of the stay-at-home” orders. That plan will rely on science, “not political pressure,” he said.

A Monday statement from Newsom, Oregon Gov. Kate Brown and Washington Gov. Jay Inslee did not have specifics about which parts of the economy can reopen first or when that process will start. Instead, it outlined common principles, including that “residents’ health comes first,” that the states must work together and that data must show a that viral transmission is slowing significantly before broad reopening of the states’ economies.

In California, more than 22,000 people have tested positive for the coronavirus, according to the latest data from the state’s Department of Public Health. Nearly 770 have died, Newsom said.

Only about 5,000 confirmed and suspected coronavirus patients are hospitalized, according to the department. That’s far below the 11,000 people the state had predicted would be hospitalized at this point, according to numbers released Monday.

If those numbers remain low, they will be far under projections from Newsom’s office that indicated the state would need to add more than 50,000 hospital beds by mid-May to accommodate a surge in COVID-19 patients.

On Friday, California Health and Human Services Secretary Dr. Mark Ghaly said the state is seeing numbers that fall within its broad projection windows, but toward the lower end - evidence Californians are slowing the spread of the virus by staying home and practicing social distancing.

“This is signaling to us that our peak may not be as high as we planned around and expected,” Ghaly said. “The difference between what we’re seeing today in our hospitals may not be that much different than where we are going to peak in the many weeks to come.”"

A: farmer with oversupply

B: absent workers

C: shutdown processing plants

D: why my food becoming more expensive!


Rep. Thomas Massie (R-Ky.) says that the country is “weeks” away from seeing food shortages.

“We are weeks, not months, away from farmers euthanizing animals that would have been sold for meat/food,” Massie tweeted on Monday morning. “Also, fruits and vegetables are going to rot in the fields. A drastic change in policy this week could ameliorate this inevitability.”

He also shared an interview he did with a local radio station where he warned about the prospects of shortages, “You have people running the government that have no clue about how the economy works and how their food gets to the table.”

Massie continued to say that he was on a conference call with the secretary of Agriculture, where officials discussed the food supply in the country. 

“The shocking thing is that farmers are watching the value of their hogs and steers, cows, go down. In fact, they’re going to some of the lowest levels ever,” he said.

He continued: “So the question is: Why is the price of meat going up in the supermarkets and the price of cattle going down at the auction ring? It’s because our supply line is brittle. You have to take cattle, steer, beef, whatever, hogs, to a processing plant. And these processing plants, like much of industrial America right now, are shutting down because of absentees, which has been exacerbated by the unemployment program the federal government has instituted.”

Massie noted that several meat processing plants, including one that was processing 1,900 cattle day, have shut down since the coronavirus outbreak. 

He continued to say that he is afraid that farmers will go bankrupt and that “cattle and hogs” will be “euthanized or incinerated and buried” while there are shortages at the market. 

“And you talk about civil unrest when you start seeing that. And it’s all because of the brittle food supply chain,” he added.

Additionally, Massie noted that he has been pushing for legislation that would solve what he believes are some of the underlying issues with the food supply chain."

The cables have fueled discussions inside the U.S. government about whether this or another Wuhan lab was the source of the virus — even though conclusive proof has yet to emerge.

In January 2018, the U.S. Embassy in Beijing took the unusual step of repeatedly sending U.S. science diplomats to the Wuhan Institute of Virology (WIV), which had in 2015 become China’s first laboratory to achieve the highest level of international bioresearch safety (known as BSL-4). WIV issued a news release in English about the last of these visits, which occurred on March 27, 2018. The U.S. delegation was led by Jamison Fouss, the consule general in Wuhan, and Rick Switzer, the embassy’s counselor of environment, science, technology and health. Last week, WIV[ erased](http://english.whiov.cas.cn/Exchange2016/Foreign_Visits/201804/t20180403_191334.html) that statement from its website, though it remains archived on the Internet.

What the U.S. officials learned during their visits concerned them so much that they dispatched two diplomatic cables categorized as Sensitive But Unclassified back to Washington. The cables warned about safety and management weaknesses at the WIV lab and proposed more attention and help. The first cable, which I obtained, also warns that the lab’s work on bat coronaviruses and their potential human transmission represented a risk of a new SARS-like pandemic.

“During interactions with scientists at the WIV laboratory, they noted the new lab has a serious shortage of appropriately trained technicians and investigators needed to safely operate this high-containment laboratory,” states the Jan. 19, 2018, cable, which was drafted by two officials from the embassy’s environment, science and health sections who met with the WIV scientists. (The State Department declined to comment on this and other details of the story.)

The Chinese researchers at WIV were receiving assistance from the Galveston National Laboratory at the University of Texas Medical Branch and other U.S. organizations, but the Chinese requested additional help. The cables argued that the United States should give the Wuhan lab further support, mainly because its research on bat coronaviruses was important but also dangerous.

As the cable noted, the U.S. visitors met with Shi Zhengli, the head of the research project, who had been publishing studies related to bat coronaviruses[ for many years](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/how-chinas-bat-woman-hunted-down-viruses-from-sars-to-the-new-coronavirus1/). In November 2017, just before the U.S. officials’ visit, Shi’s team had[ published research](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5708621/) showing that horseshoe bats they had collected from a cave in Yunnan province were very likely from the same bat population that spawned the SARS coronavirus in 2003.

“Most importantly,” the cable states, “the researchers also showed that various SARS-like coronaviruses can interact with ACE2, the human receptor identified for SARS-coronavirus. This finding strongly suggests that SARS-like coronaviruses from bats can be transmitted to humans to cause SARS-like diseases. From a public health perspective, this makes the continued surveillance of SARS-like coronaviruses in bats and study of the animal-human interface critical to future emerging coronavirus outbreak prediction and prevention.”

The research was designed to prevent the next SARS-like pandemic by anticipating how it might emerge. But even in 2015, other[ scientists questioned](https://www.nature.com/news/engineered-bat-virus-stirs-debate-over-risky-research-1.18787?WT.mc_id=TWT_NatureNews) whether Shi’s team was taking unnecessary risks. In October 2014, the U.S. government had[ imposed a moratorium](https://www.nature.com/news/us-suspends-risky-disease-research-1.16192) on funding of any research that makes a virus more deadly or contagious, known as “gain-of-function” experiments.

As[ many have pointed out](https://www.nature.com/news/engineered-bat-virus-stirs-debate-over-risky-research-1.18787), there is no evidence that the virus now plaguing the world was engineered; scientists largely agree it came from animals. But that is not the same as saying it didn’t come from the lab, which spent years testing bat coronaviruses in animals, said Xiao Qiang, a research scientist at the School of Information at the University of California at Berkeley.

“The cable tells us that there have long been concerns about the possibility of the threat to public health that came from this lab’s research, if it was not being adequately conducted and protected,” he said.

There are similar concerns about the nearby Wuhan Center for Disease Control and Prevention lab, which operates at biosecurity level 2, a level significantly less secure than the level-4 standard claimed by the Wuhan Insititute of Virology lab, Xiao said. That’s important because the Chinese government still refuses to answer basic questions about the origin of the novel coronavirus while suppressing any attempts to examine whether either lab was involved.

>(CNN)Like many in the restaurant industry, Suzanne and Roger Perry saw their business -- Datz Restaurant Group in Tampa, Florida -- take a huge hit because of the coronavirus pandemic.

>Across the US, states have ordered the closure of bars and restaurants to help curb the spread of the virus. Some restaurants have completely shut down, others have transitioned to pick-up or delivery only, and a handful have resorted to creative options -- including selling groceries or including toilet paper in their food orders -- to keep their businesses afloat.

>As a result of such restrictions on the restaurant industry, Datz Restaurant Group went from close to 400 employees to just 27, and the Perrys said they were running out of money to keep even their skeleton staff paid.

>""(Our employees are) family now,"" Suzanne Perry told CNN. ""We've watched their children grow up and they've done absolutely nothing wrong, but we can't protect them. There's absolutely nothing we can do. We can't pay people when we have no revenue.""

>So as a last resort, the couple decided to sell the most valuable item in the restaurant's inventory: A 25-year-old bottle of Old Rip Van Winkle bourbon.

>""I Googled it to see what the prices were online and I saw anywhere from $17,000 to $26,000 online,"" Suzanne Perry said. ""So I listed it for $20,000, and offered a 15% discount online.""

>Offers for the rare spirit started rolling in, but most were much less than the $20,000 they were asking for.

>""I was selling it in order to maintain my staff for a few more weeks until we can get through this and figure it out so I didn't entertain any of those low-ball offers,"" Suzanne Perry said said.

>But then, the Perrys received a call from a local couple who frequented their restaurants.

>""A woman called and I spoke to her husband,"" Suzanne Perry told CNN. ""He's a veteran. He appreciates bourbon and he wanted to add it in his collection and they decided that they would purchase it. We were very happy about that.""

>Instead of buying it online, however, the man insisted that he would buy it in person with a cashier's check.

>""He drove it in the next morning and handed Roger the check,"" Suzanne Perry said. ""Roger looked at it and saw that rather than what would have been $17,000 with the discount that we had offered, the check was written for $40,000.""

>The couple thought it was a mistake, so they tried to give the check back -- but the man said he wanted them to keep it, according to Suzanne Perry.

>""I was so moved by that,"" Suzanne Perry recalled. ""It was really touching that someone would reach so far into their own pocket to help us survive this.""

>Suzanne said the man wanted to remain anonymous, but described him as a local veteran and philanthropist who is ""very low key and humble.""

>Now, because of the veteran's act of extreme generosity, the Perrys will be able to keep their restaurants running for takeout and delivery, keep their remaining employees paid for another four weeks and even bring a few employees back to work.

>The extra $20,000 has also allowed the Datz Restaurant Group to provide hundreds of meals for the health care workers and first responders who are tirelessly battling the coronavirus.

>Once the crisis ends and the Datz Restaurant Group comes out on the other side, Suzanne Perry said she will make sure she repays the bourbon buyer for his kindness.

>""There are causes that he cares about deeply, causes that are really near and dear to his heart and I will support him in the form of catering events. I will promote them, I'll do whatever I can,"" Suzanne Perry said. ""What he has done for me is going to come back to him a hundred times.""

It would be easier to know what to do with Tara Reade’s accusation that Joe Biden sexually assaulted her if her tale were more solid, or if it were less.

In the past few days, The New York Times, The Washington Post and The Associated Press all reported on a story that’s been circulating through the left- and right-wing media for the last few weeks. Reade, a staff assistant in Biden’s Senate office in the early 1990s, is one of the women who last year spoke out about Biden’s handsiness. When The A.P. interviewed Reade last April, she said that Biden “rubbed her shoulders and neck” and “played with her hair.”

She also told The Union, a California newspaper, last year that she didn’t feel sexualized. “She instead compared her experience to being a lamp,” the paper reported. She told the reporter, Alan Riquelmy: “‘It’s pretty. Set it over there.’ Then when it’s too bright, you throw it away.”

But last month, in an interview with the left-wing podcast host Katie Halper, Reade added new, more serious details to her story, claiming that Biden pushed her against a wall and penetrated her with his fingers. (The Biden campaign has said, “This absolutely did not happen.”)

Since Reade made her latest accusation, people on both the left and the right have been demanding, with a mix of genuine outrage and gotcha glee, that the Democratic Party live up to its #MeToo commitments and #BelieveTaraReade. “For Elite Democrats, Joe Biden’s Candidacy Means Ditching #MeToo,” said a headline in the socialist magazine Jacobin. “Joe Biden, Brett Kavanaugh and the #MeToo hypocrites,” said one in The New York Post.

So must Democrats, for the sake of consistency, regard their presumptive presidential nominee as a sexual predator?

As I’ve written repeatedly, I think Biden is a weak candidate, and I wouldn’t be unhappy if the Democratic Party were forced, by some last-minute emergency, to replace him, maybe with one of the Democratic governors who has shined in response to the coronavirus crisis.

But, absent other accusations, that is not going to happen. Reade seems almost engineered in a lab to inspire skepticism in mainstream Democrats, both because her story keeps changing and because of her bizarre public worship of President Vladimir Putin of Russia. “President Putin has an alluring combination of strength with gentleness,” she wrote in a since-deleted 2018 Medium post. “His sensuous image projects his love for life, the embodiment of grace while facing adversity.” (Reade has since said her comments about Russia stemmed from a novel she was writing, though the Medium article is written as an op-ed essay.) In December she tweeted, with worrying grandiosity, “I worked for the Senate, I know the plan to bring Russia to its knees.”"

April 13 2020, The Times

Britain will remain in lockdown for another three weeks as the cabinet debates whether to encourage some people to return to work.
Dominic Raab, who is deputising for Boris Johnson, will announce on Thursday that the lockdown will stay in place until at least May 7.

He is expected to ask Nicola Sturgeon, Scotland’s first minister, and the other leaders of the devolved administrations to attend a Cobra meeting to ensure a UK-wide approach in setting the deadline, the maximum allowed under emergency legislation that mandates reviews every three weeks.

Senior ministers are split, however, on whether to encourage people to return to the workplace if it is safe to do so and if they cannot work from home, as evidence of the economic, social and health costs of the lockdown mounts.

Participation at work is lower than expected when the lockdown was designed, adding billions of pounds to the cost of the furlough scheme and other mitigation measures, and risking deeper damage to the economy.
Matt Hancock, the health secretary, does not want to risk undermining the “stay at home” message and has the backing of some in Downing Street who believe that efforts to encourage people to work are futile given public opinion.

Nearly three quarters of people in the UK, 74 per cent, prioritise limiting the spread of the infection even if it means extra costs to the economy, compared with 61 per cent in the United States and 54 per cent in Germany and Sweden. Thirteen per cent in the UK want to protect the economy even if it means allowing the virus to spread, half the proportion in Germany, according to polling by Kekst CNC.

Experts advising the government will meet today and on Thursday to assess the latest data but Mr Raab made clear that there was no immediate prospect of relaxing the lockdown. “We don’t expect to make any changes to the measures currently in place at that point,” he said. “We have come too far, lost too many loved ones and sacrificed too much to ease up.”

Also at the government’s daily press conference Sir Patrick Vallance, the chief scientific adviser, braced the UK for a “difficult” week in which another rise in the daily number of deaths is expected. He said evidence from other countries suggested that the number of deaths would plateau “for two or three weeks” before starting to fall.

Although the lockdown is helping to shrink infection rates, he said, a rise in the numbers is being driven by “cases in care homes and in hospitals where infections are being picked up”.

Chris Whitty, the chief medical officer for England, said that 92 care homes had reported coronavirus infections in the past 24 hours, taking the total proportion of care homes to have declared Covid-19 cases to 13.5 per cent.

It also emerged that the government was reviewing whether to change its advice and recommend that people wear facemasks to help slow the spread of the coronavirus. “We look at this and update our view from time to time,” Sir Patrick said. “We’re actually looking at it again now. The evidence on masks is much more persuasive for masks stopping you giving it to somebody than it is for preventing you catching it.”
He added that if there were “evidence that looks like we should change our advice, we would do so”.

Ministers are under pressure over shortages of PPE, particularly gowns. Distribution problems and rapidly depleting stockpiles have become one of the most urgent worries.
A three-week extension will give Mr Johnson more time to recover and to shape the decision, ministers said, and in any case public opinion is firmly against relaxation for now. “You could open every sports stadium in the country but I’m not sure you’d get many takers,” one senior minister said.
Mr Johnson will also want to involve the leaders of the devolved administrations and mayors including Sadiq Khan and Andy Burnham in the way forward.
He will return to Downing Street to find himself refereeing a cabinet that is split over whether to press people to return to work.
The prime minister discussed the crisis with Mr Raab on Saturday but has promised his medical team that he will not return to Downing Street immediately.
He is in daily discussion with clinicians and there is no set time for his recovery. His spokesman said yesterday that Mr Johnson was “not carrying out any government work”.
He will not play any part in a review of the lockdown, which is widely expected to keep the restrictions in place, a government source said. That leaves Mr Raab, the foreign secretary, in charge of overseeing the review, which will be formally conducted by Matt Hancock, the health secretary, as part of the emergency legislation passed to deal with the crisis.

With no cabinet today, the decision to extend will be rubber-stamped by the so-called war cabinet on Thursday. In addition to Mr Raab and Mr Hancock, this includes Rishi Sunak, the chancellor, and Michael Gove, the Cabinet Office minister.
Senior sources acknowledge that Mr Johnson will return to an unresolved debate about how far to press people to return to work where they can safely do so. Ministers say that it is too simplistic to divide them into “hawks” and “doves” on the complex decisions and trade-offs over easing the lockdown as deaths from the virus fall, probably later this month. It fails to account for their duty to represent the interests of their departments and presents as binary choices that are anything but, they say.

Nevertheless, cabinet ministers acknowledge that there are varying degrees of appetite for the immediate risk posed by the virus and the longer-term but potentially worse risk posed by closing down large sections of the economy and society into the late summer and autumn.

“The original message was to carry on working but do so if you could from home. We need to find a way at the right time to get back to that message,” one “hawk” said.
Ministers on the “dove” side of the debate say that the government must wait for public opinion to turn before encouraging people back to work. Those most involved in the economy — Mr Sunak, Robert Jenrick, the communities secretary, and Alok Sharma, the business secretary — are unsurprisingly the most likely to raise concerns about the costs of the lockdown, as red lights start to flash on their departmental dashboards.

Local government finance is becoming a serious worry as the number of people defaulting on their council tax soars. The number of commercial tenants in rent arrears could hit 80 per cent by June, according to one internal estimate.

The Treasury warns of “systemic failures” if the economy is not brought out of its coma by mid-summer. “There’s a point where there just isn’t anything to come back to,” one well-placed source said. “You’ve got to give businesses some idea that they will be trading by mid-summer.”

Even those in economic ministries acknowledge the constraints. “The worst thing would be to relax too soon and to have to shut down again this autumn,” one said.
Work is nevertheless continuing across departments on options for the first relaxations. The list of shops allowed to open could be expanded either by changing the definition of what is deemed essential or, more likely, to include retail outlets most able to enforce social distancing of customers.
Moves to restart construction and manufacturing are also being considered, although both face supply chain challenges in addition to those posed by keeping their workforces safe — and questions over whether public transport can cope with social distancing rules as commuters start to return.
While reopening schools has been suggested for inclusion in the “first steps” of releasing the lockdown, the move is by no means certain — not least because it is far from clear that parents would be willing to allow their children to attend given the difficulties of keeping pupils apart, particularly those in primary schools.
“Some of this takes the judgment of Solomon,” one minister admitted.
Another said: “It’s an awful lot easier to shut everything down than to restart it. We’re not just going to flick a switch and it’s all as it was.”

**Preliminary**: denoting an action or event preceding or done in preparation for something fuller or more important.


And when on Jan 20, 2020, when new evidences appeared, a transmission from patient to doctor and family member to family member was observed and showed there was human-to-human transmission, China reported to the WHO.

I've been seeing and hearing quite a few people say that they think they already had Coronavirus late last year or early this year, before we were aware of it. I bring this up because some of them are exhibiting risky behavior by taking unnecessary trips outside their home and not taking personal safety measures seriously because they think they are already immune... now, I have been social isolating and not leaving my home unless necessary, but I was also one of those people thinking that I already had been infected with the virus, having gotten REALLY sick over Christmas break with a terrible cough and shortness of breath. I am a relatively young and healthy person who rarely gets sick, and this really knocked me out for weeks, but eventually, I got better without needing intervention. I was secretly hopeful that as a result, I was now better protected.

Yesterday, I was randomly selected to participate as one of 1000 LA county residents to get tested for antibodies as part of a study to see how Coronavirus has affected different communities. It was a study that I had submitted for online a week or so ago, along with my husband, who was not selected. I was fairly convinced I would test positive for the antibodies... I tested NEGATIVE.

I just wanted to share this to show that just because you were extremely ill a few months before, does not mean that you have been exposed to it and survived. Please do not assume that you are immune to the virus and please continue to stay healthy and safe by social distancing, staying home and washing your hands."

Title: Brazilian trial for drug touted by Trump halted after 11 patients die on high does. 

From the actual article that you likely didn't read: 

>""The Brazil study was undertaken with 81 patients at a hospital in  Manaus, in Amazonas state. As well as chloroquine, patients were also  given azithromycin, an antibiotic also being used in the U.S., often  paired with chloroquine. However, higher dose use of chloroquine (600  milligrams as opposed to 450 milligrams) was stopped after just six  days, after 11 of patients who were given the greater dose died. ""

You're right, the drugs aren't the same. Luckily, that doesn't matter, because Trump has promoted both of them, and the FDA has approved both for use to fight the coronavirus.  From the FDA

[https://www.fda.gov/media/136534/download](https://www.fda.gov/media/136534/download)

> Having concluded that the criteria for issuance of this authorization under 564(c) of the Act are met, I am authorizing the emergency use of chloroquine phosphate and hydroxychloroquine sulfate, as described in the Scope of Authorization section of this letter (Section II) for treatment of COVID-19 when clinical trials are not available, or participation is not feasible, subject to the terms of this authorization. 

So, we can say with certainty that the title is 100% correct and not misleading, unless I have missed something? Please do tell.  

&#x200B;

> But these titles that are making the two into one and the same medication is just plain irresponsible journalism. 

LOL.  The title is literally: ""COVID-19: Brazilian trial for drug touted by Trump halted after 11 patients die on high dose""

You know what's irresponsible? Some people would say that accusing the media of ""Irresponsible journalism"" for a completely factually correct (and in no way misleading) headline supported by completely factually correct and not misleading text is irresponsible.    

Maybe you're referring to this text from the article? 

>The similar drugs chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine have been pushed  by Trump as a possible partial solution to the pandemic in the U.S.,  where they are sold under brand names like Nivaquine and Plaquenil. The  Times reports that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration has granted  emergency approval for the use of both drugs at U.S. hospitals, and U.S.  companies have begun producing them in greater numbers. Trump has been  vociferous on the drugs’ potential benefits, but among those to  contradict his views are his own top expert Anthony Fauci, who has  provided regular updates to Americans on the crisis. During one recent  daily White House coronavirus briefing, Trump stepped in and prevented  Fauci from answering a question about hydroxychloroquine.  
>  
>Experts  say that in reality there is not much to back up theories that  chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine are effective against COVID-19.  Cholroquine was first touted as a treatment during the MERS outbreak of  2012, Science Alert reports, but it wasn’t pursued because it wasn’t  proving to be effective.

&#x200B;

So let's recap.  The title in no way tried to conflate the two drugs into one. Furthermore, the text in no way tried to do that either.  But yet, you, for some mystical, unknown reason, feel like the article is ""Irresponsible Journalism""."

>The U.S. chose to use its own test, rather than the one circulated by WHO. **Other nations, such as China, Japan and France, also developed their own tests. Multiple public health experts said that is not unusual.** 

Did the CDC screw up? Yeah, but these are the brightest scientists in the world. You can fault Trump all you want, but this is simply bad luck by the CDC in that the test worked great in the lab but some manufacturing defect ended up screwing this up.

Also some more  clarification on test kits and the WHO--the WHO isn't a manufacturing plant that churns out test kits for countries like us. It provides reference test kits so countries can copy if they don't want to develop their own. That's it. Your talking point acts as if somehow the US would've relied on these kits and we would've magically solved all our testing issues but fails to understand the WHO's real role here.

Having something on your hip that pumps what you need with a few button presses is more efficient for me than pulling out all the sanitation and injection supplies. It would also be cool to dose before breaks so I have that 15 minute head start before I eat, doing that significantly improved my numbers

>As Supreme Court Justice Robert Jackson trenchantly noted in 1949 in his dissenting opinion in [Terminiello v. Chicago](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/337/1/), the Constitution is not a “suicide pact.”

>The 10th Amendment reserves to the states broad [police power](https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution-conan/amendment-14/section-1/property-and-police-power) to regulate behavior and enforce order within their territory in order to protect the health, safety, and general welfare of their inhabitants.  

>Significantly, the Supreme Court has held that states can invoke such authority—within reason—to respond to a health crisis. 

>In response to an outbreak of smallpox more than a century ago, the Massachusetts Legislature passed a mandatory vaccination law for adults, imposing hefty fines and potential imprisonment for those who refused.

>Proclaiming the law to be an invasion of his liberty, Henning Jacobson, a pastor and community leader, refused to be vaccinated, was prosecuted and fined, and subsequently filed a lawsuit challenging the constitutionality of this edict.  

>Writing for the 7-2 majority in Jacobson v. Massachusetts (1905), Justice John Marshall Harlan rejected Jacobson’s argument, upholding the state’s right to vaccinate Jacobson against his will.  

>Citing precedent in which the court had upheld the authority of states “to enact quarantine laws and health laws of every description,” Harlan wrote that “the liberty secured by the Constitution of the United States to every person within its jurisdiction does not import an absolute right in each person to be, at all times and in all circumstances, wholly freed from restraint.”

The real solution is never going to be ""this one group"". To actually make housing fair and affordable you have to put in place checks and balances to minimize exploitive behaviour, to implement supplements and reasonable wages, to properly assess zoning based on supply and demand, to apply both incentives and punitive measures for the entire housing market.

Since everyone at Valve is currently stuck at home due to the coronavirus, that's probably as much as they can do right now. And even if they weren't, [there's seemingly only one developer working on TF2 anymore and he's not even working on it full time these days due to Half-Life: Alyx](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dk_kIHBaKw0). I'm pretty sure the only reason they worked so hard to get a fix out that quickly was because mainstream gaming outlets had begun to pick up the story.

It's really quite disappointing, but unfortunately TF2 is 12 years old now and CS:GO and Dota 2 both make an order of magnitude more revenue than TF2 does. Hopefully Valve eventually decides to make a TF3 at some point, but it'll be a while before that could even be started since Valve is currently busy with porting CS:GO to Source 2 (heavily leaked to be planned to ship before the end of 2020), the Artifact overhaul (entering closed beta within the next few weeks), and Half-Life: Alyx's all-but-confirmed sequel (basically everyone has said that they loved working on it, it sold *extremely* well for a VR-only game, and many different people at Valve have said that they were excited about continuing the franchise beyond just HLA)."

That’s why some common complaints aren’t listed below. Like many other industries, I’m cutting Epic some slack due to the coronavirus outbreak. Also, the less coding involved, the quicker ideas can be implemented.

* Release patch notes for every update and restart the weekly competitive updates-self-explanatory
* Remove heavy sniper and minigun from competitive playlists\*\*-\*\*The issues with both weapons have been detailed for seasons. For the heavy sniper, replace all spawns with the silenced snipers. For minigun henchmen, change them from miniguns to rapid fire smgs.
* Remove the mythic weapons from competitive playlists-The mythic guns in general should no linger drop from bosses. However, they will still drop the keycards. I like the idea of vaults for more interesting early game fights and as a unique mechanic, but combined with mythics/heavy snipe/miniguns at the same POI, they are currently too powerful. Removing all three greatly reduces the strength.
* Detail a list of banned weapons from comp-Giving the players an idea of what weapons can’t be included in the comp playlist gives the playerbase a better understanding of how epic balanaces and what weapons to practice for future seasons.
* Have RPGs only drop out of crates and reduce rocket ammo to 9-With other power weapons removed, the RPG now becomes the strongest weapon in the game. This nerf keeps it in the game, but reduced the chance of double RPG/late game RPG spam
* Add in the option to disable pre-edits/disable pre-edits entirely in competitive modes.-I don’t know a situation where pre-edits are more helpful than harmful in comp.
* Match bloom/recoil for KBM and controller -I think finding a medium between the two’s current values would be a good solution, but regardless of what is decided, both inputs should match
* Add reset on release to controller on KBM, remove the ability to bind reset and shoot to scroll wheel-Similar to the bloom change, this brings the inputs more equal on ability to reset and makes options for resetting more consistent to editing
* Find a solution to reduce the strength of aim assist close range-The area most broken with linear aim assist is close range firing with SMGs. Some people have mentioned reducing strength to 93-94 fixes this. If that is the case (and a reconstruction of how linear works is not required), then go ahead and require this in competitive modes.
* Release the 2020 competitive roadmap with different scenarios based on how long the coronavirus outbreak lasts-This was already mentioned as a post planning to be release. However, if there is a chance of a LAN later in the year, show timelines of that occurring and not occurring, and the criteria for staging that event.
* Release a blog post on ban decisions for major incidents this season (week 1 storm surge tags, stream sniping weeks 2/3) detailing why players were/weren’t banned and better spelling out specific actions that will result in a ban-Especially in NAE, cheating accusations have been flying around all season, with no explanation on why the bans occurred. Publicly listing bans and reasons, along with better rules for what causes bans, will reduce that specific behavior while making it easier to ban cheaters in the future
* Mandate a 2 minute stream delay for all cash events with over $1000 prize pool-This allows streamers to stream low stakes events like the daily duo cup and hype nites, but for all events it allows for a consistent delay between streamers (which improves the broadcast experience) while reducing the effectiveness of stream sniping
* Contract out ballatw and shyowager’s stream for Sunday finals/Grand finals events, and find other casters for regions outside NAE/Europe to showcase on the FN channel-Since WC broadcasts cannot resume until after the coronavirus pandemic, utilizing people already casting provides a broadcast experience for all, while incentivizing new casters to enter the scene.
* Implement the daily duo cup scoring for future FNCS-The daily cash cup scoring system allows for better balance between focusing on winning and going for high kills than the current scoring system. This also can reduce the effect of RNG from quality of first lobbies in opens/semis
* Reduce the qualifying teams to the 2nd round of FNCS to 600 duos, 400 trios, and 300 squads-There is still a very big skill gap between the top teams in each region, and the 1000th best team. Decreasing the number of qualifiers allows for better semis games and competitors who survive opens have a better chance of making finals than before.
* Remove cash cups for future seasons-Cash cups are an ugly duckling. They are RNG based on quality of lobbies, provide poor practice for FNCS due to the lower requirements, yet offer big prize pools that exceed weekly FNCS prizes in some cases. Additionally, since there is now a console/mobile FNCS, holding platform events is less important. Removing them and reallocating prize money to FNCS finals would better reward the best play in a region every week.
* **Edit:** Add nerfing floppers to 2 seconds, change rarity to blue, and decrease the chance of fishing one-storm flopper plays are fun to watch, but when someone has more than 4 floppers and hides deep in storm, it is ridiculous. This nerf reduces the amount of time one can stay in storm and makes flopper players stationary for longer. Additionally, relative to other white heals, floppers are much stronger in both speed and amount healed heal"

Two years before the novel coronavirus pandemic upended the world, U.S. Embassy officials visited a Chinese research facility in the city of Wuhan several times and sent two official warnings back to Washington about inadequate safety at the lab, which was conducting risky studies on coronaviruses from bats. 
**The cables have fueled discussions inside the U.S. government about whether this or another Wuhan lab was the source of the virus — even though conclusive proof has yet to emerge.**

In January 2018, the U.S. Embassy in Beijing took the unusual step of repeatedly sending U.S. science diplomats to the Wuhan Institute of Virology (WIV), which had in 2015 become China’s first laboratory to achieve the highest level of international bioresearch safety (known as BSL-4). WIV issued a news release in English about the last of these visits, which occurred on March 27, 2018. The U.S. delegation was led by Jamison Fouss, the consul general in Wuhan, and Rick Switzer, the embassy’s counselor of environment, science, technology and health. Last week, WIV erased that statement from its website, though it remains archived on the Internet.
Full coverage of the coronavirus pandemic

What the U.S. officials learned during their visits concerned them so much that they dispatched two diplomatic cables categorized as Sensitive But Unclassified back to Washington. The cables warned about safety and management weaknesses at the WIV lab and proposed more attention and help. The first cable, which I obtained, also warns that the lab’s work on bat coronaviruses and their potential human transmission represented a risk of a new SARS-like pandemic.
“During interactions with scientists at the WIV laboratory, they noted the new lab has a serious shortage of appropriately trained technicians and investigators needed to safely operate this high-containment laboratory,” states the Jan. 19, 2018, cable, which was drafted by two officials from the embassy’s environment, science and health sections who met with the WIV scientists. (The State Department declined to comment on this and other details of the story.)
The Chinese researchers at WIV were receiving assistance from the Galveston National Laboratory at the University of Texas Medical Branch and other U.S. organizations, but the Chinese requested additional help. The cables argued that the United States should give the Wuhan lab further support, mainly because its research on bat coronaviruses was important but also dangerous.
As the cable noted, the U.S. visitors met with Shi Zhengli, the head of the research project, who had been publishing studies related to bat coronaviruses for many years. In November 2017, just before the U.S. officials’ visit, Shi’s team had published research showing that horseshoe bats they had collected from a cave in Yunnan province were very likely from the same bat population that spawned the SARS coronavirus in 2003.
“Most importantly,” the cable states, “the researchers also showed that various SARS-like coronaviruses can interact with ACE2, the human receptor identified for SARS-coronavirus. This finding strongly suggests that SARS-like coronaviruses from bats can be transmitted to humans to cause SARS-like diseases. From a public health perspective, this makes the continued surveillance of SARS-like coronaviruses in bats and study of the animal-human interface critical to future emerging coronavirus outbreak prediction and prevention.”
The research was designed to prevent the next SARS-like pandemic by anticipating how it might emerge. But even in 2015, other scientists questioned whether Shi’s team was taking unnecessary risks. In October 2014, the U.S. government had imposed a moratorium on funding of any research that makes a virus more deadly or contagious, known as “gain-of-function” experiments.
As many have pointed out, there is no evidence that the virus now plaguing the world was engineered; scientists largely agree it came from animals. But that is not the same as saying it didn’t come from the lab, which spent years testing bat coronaviruses in animals, said Xiao Qiang, a research scientist at the School of Information at the University of California at Berkeley.
“The cable tells us that there have long been concerns about the possibility of the threat to public health that came from this lab’s research, if it was not being adequately conducted and protected,” he said.
There are similar concerns about the nearby Wuhan Center for Disease Control and Prevention lab, which operates at biosecurity level 2, a level significantly less secure than the level-4 standard claimed by the Wuhan Insititute of Virology lab, Xiao said. That’s important because the Chinese government still refuses to answer basic questions about the origin of the novel coronavirus while suppressing any attempts to examine whether either lab was involved.
Sources familiar with the cables said they were meant to sound an alarm about the grave safety concerns at the WIV lab, especially regarding its work with bat coronaviruses. The embassy officials were calling for more U.S. attention to this lab and more support for it, to help it fix its problems.
“The cable was a warning shot,” one U.S. official said. “They were begging people to pay attention to what was going on.”
No extra assistance to the labs was provided by the U.S. government in response to these cables. The cables began to circulate again inside the administration over the past two months as officials debated whether the lab could be the origin of the pandemic and what the implications would be for the U.S. pandemic response and relations with China.
Inside the Trump administration, many national security officials have long suspected either the WIV or the Wuhan Center for Disease Control and Prevention lab was the source of the novel coronavirus outbreak. According to the New York Times, the intelligence community has provided no evidence to confirm this. But one senior administration official told me that the cables provide one more piece of evidence to support the possibility that the pandemic is the result of a lab accident in Wuhan.
“The idea that it was just a totally natural occurrence is circumstantial. The evidence it leaked from the lab is circumstantial. Right now, the ledger on the side of it leaking from the lab is packed with bullet points and there’s almost nothing on the other side,” the official said.
As my colleague David Ignatius noted, the Chinese government’s original story — that the virus emerged from a seafood market in Wuhan — is shaky. Research by Chinese experts published in the Lancet in January showed the first known patient, identified on Dec. 1, had no connection to the market, nor did more than one-third of the cases in the first large cluster. Also, the market didn’t sell bats. Shi and other WIV researchers have categorically denied this lab was the origin for the novel coronavirus. On Feb. 3, her team was the first to publicly report the virus known as 2019-nCoV was a bat-derived coronavirus.
The Chinese government, meanwhile, has put a total lockdown on information related to the virus origins. Beijing has yet to provide U.S. experts with samples of the novel coronavirus collected from the earliest cases. The Shanghai lab that published the novel coronavirus genome on Jan. 11 was quickly shut down by authorities for “rectification.” Several of the doctors and journalists who reported on the spread early on have disappeared.
On Feb. 14, Chinese President Xi Jinping called for a new biosecurity law to be accelerated. On Wednesday, CNN reported the Chinese government has placed severe restrictions requiring approval before any research institution publishes anything on the origin of the novel coronavirus.
The origin story is not just about blame. It’s crucial to understanding how the novel coronavirus pandemic started because that informs how to prevent the next one. The Chinese government must be transparent and answer the questions about the Wuhan labs because they are vital to our scientific understanding of the virus, said Xiao.

**We don’t know whether the novel coronavirus originated in the Wuhan lab, but the cable pointed to the danger there and increases the impetus to find out, he said.**

“I don’t think it’s a conspiracy theory. I think it’s a legitimate question that needs to be investigated and answered,” he said. “To understand exactly how this originated is critical knowledge for preventing this from happening in the future.”"

People ask all the time ""what to do"" if not electoralism. Start a revolution ? Non electoral organization isnt trying to cause a revolution, its trying to build the local trust,infastructure ,influence, presence and connection of the left for when a revolutionary situation or big crisis happens. You can never predict when situations of crisis happen that spin our lives upside down. A pandemic, a crash, a scandal, a war, environmental disaster whatever local crisis,local issues .Huge opportunities to act and take advantage of things


**Current Coronavirus example(of course if there was no lockdown but still you get the point, its an example of revolutionary left acting through a crisis)**

* Join localy to whatever socialist org (dsa, psl, whatever) you have, or fucking create a group if need be and push the following actions, with the corona crisis in mind

* talk to the people of your community/neighbourhood door by door starting with the poorest ereas

* By talking to people find and write down the biggest cracks and complains in the local system handling of this crisis and the shortages and dysfunctions that people have the most issues with.Whats missing the most

* While you are at it explain and highlight the failure of the US system to this crisis and take advantage of it through a working class world view to this people without being preachy. Give some short facts about some of the shit we are raging here with plain language. Even if 1/5th of them stick ,its a win

* Shift your manpower and materials and money (that went to fucking electoralism for the last 4 years) to fill those gaps and disfunctions the system has failed them. Help guaranteened people by carrying  food and medical supplies to their door, give away masks or info about the virus, do rent strikes and fight to aliviate economic stress in the community, educate localy about what people should do about the virus, organize complains about the handling of the crisis to local authorities offices. Push for more tests, school closures, cleaning etc. Help with the most affected groups. Also all of that in the workplace and union level

* Build that way a trust and connections to the local level. Replace and highlight the failures of the system at every chance especially for the poorest communities and start to become the main avenue through which problems and complaints and crisis in the community are dealt or protested to the higher authorities. 

* You can slowly create structures through which the people taht you helped participate in some meetings once a week or show to talk about problems in the community and help the actual people organize for their own self management once they see good results. Even if they arent part of the party

* Then you can even do local electoralism if you want with your own candidates  with good results as actual socialists but more importantly gain people to your side all over the country at every community and small or big town.

* Be in a way better position when shit actualy hits the fan and have the trust, connections and organization capabilities to take action when things start to collapse in a huge crisis etc and in any other chance

* Do this all over the country coherently and with orgs connected to each other and sharing info

This is how dual power is build and this is how the movement grows stronger. Not electoralism that has given us shit so far. What from all of these sound utopian or out of this world"

One thing that bothers me is how few people know the origin of the idea that hydroxychloroquine might be effective against COVID-19. The hypothesis that antimalarial drugs might be effective treatments for COVID-19 originated in Wuhan, China during the early phase of the pandemic in January. There, Chinese researchers reported that none of their 80 patients with lupus erythematosus who were taking hydroxychloroquine went on to become infected with SARS-CoV-2. As a result of that and old evidence of antiviral activity for the drugs, they became interested in using these antimalarial drugs to treat COVID-19. (Never mind that immunosuppressed patients are exactly the patients most likely to assiduously follow the recommendations of public health authorities during a pandemic.) A number of clinical trials were registered, and, based on anecdotal reports and small clinical trials (nearly all of which are as yet unpublished), in February the Chinese government published an expert consensus recommending CQ or HCQ for patients with COVID-19. Soon after, a number of nations followed suit. Apparently Raoult found out about this, and suddenly, at the end of February, he posted a video entitled Coronavirus: End of the game, later renamed “Coronavirus: A way out of the crisis?”"

> Once a national state of emergency is declared the president is given a considerable scope of power with little to no oversight, and suspends many facets associated with ""States Rights""

Yes. When *the President* (not the United States) declares a national emergency this makes certain powers available to the President. Except this power comes from an Act of Congress (a couple, in this case - the Public Health Service Act and the National Emergencies Act). These put in place formalities and restrictions on what powers are available and how they can be used.

It does not give the President ultimate power, it does not let him override the Constitution, and it does not let him do whatever he wants. In particular, he has to specify which powers he is activating; and here [he specified fairly narrow powers](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/proclamation-declaring-national-emergency-concerning-novel-coronavirus-disease-covid-19-outbreak/) letting the Secretary of HHS ""temporarily waive or modify certain requirements of the Medicare, Medicaid, and State Children’s Health Insurance programs and of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act Privacy Rule.""

That's pretty much it, from the original declaration of emergency.

More significantly here, President Trump's comments about having absolute power involved *ending* the state of emergency (ordering people back to work). While the President can declare a national emergency and declare that it is over, he can't declare State states of emergency to be over.

--------

On the border wall business, President Trump *did* declare a national emergency to fund his border fence. Congress voted to revoke it, but President Trump vetoed the revocation, and Congress couldn't get the 2/3rds majority to override the veto. There have been several lawsuits aimed at blocking it, some have been successful in the early stages (at least one got a preliminary injunction blocking it, but that was overturned by the Supreme Court 5-4), but the wheels of justice turn slowly, especially where President Trump and his organisations are concerned (he has a lifetime of experience at delaying and stalling litigation).

I would be interested to see if any US President previously has claimed to have ""absolute power."" I suspect they haven't gone quite that far, as no previous Presidents were quite as ignorant of basic constitutional principles.

President Trump does not have ""absolute power."" The fear many have is that - as with his border fence - he will try to exercise absolute power, and this time, that could get hundreds of thousands of people killed."

By Josh Rogin

April 14, 2020 at 6:00 p.m. GMT+8

Two years before the novel coronavirus pandemic upended the world, U.S. Embassy officials visited a Chinese research facility in the city of Wuhan several times and sent two official warnings back to Washington about inadequate safety at the lab, which was conducting risky studies on coronaviruses from bats. The cables have fueled discussions inside the U.S. government about whether this or another Wuhan lab was the source of the virus — even though conclusive proof has yet to emerge.

In January 2018, the U.S. Embassy in Beijing took the unusual step of repeatedly sending U.S. science diplomats to the Wuhan Institute of Virology (WIV), which had in 2015 become China’s first laboratory to achieve the highest level of international bioresearch safety (known as BSL-4). WIV issued a news release in English about the last of these visits, which occurred on March 27, 2018. The U.S. delegation was led by Jamison Fouss, the consul general in Wuhan, and Rick Switzer, the embassy’s counselor of environment, science, technology and health. Last week, WIV erased that statement from its website, though it remains archived on the Internet.

What the U.S. officials learned during their visits concerned them so much that they dispatched two diplomatic cables categorized as Sensitive But Unclassified back to Washington. The cables warned about safety and management weaknesses at the WIV lab and proposed more attention and help. The first cable, which I obtained, also warns that the lab’s work on bat coronaviruses and their potential human transmission represented a risk of a new SARS-like pandemic.

“During interactions with scientists at the WIV laboratory, they noted the new lab has a serious shortage of appropriately trained technicians and investigators needed to safely operate this high-containment laboratory,” states the Jan. 19, 2018, cable, which was drafted by two officials from the embassy’s environment, science and health sections who met with the WIV scientists. (The State Department declined to comment on this and other details of the story.)

The Chinese researchers at WIV were receiving assistance from the Galveston National Laboratory at the University of Texas Medical Branch and other U.S. organizations, but the Chinese requested additional help. The cables argued that the United States should give the Wuhan lab further support, mainly because its research on bat coronaviruses was important but also dangerous.

As the cable noted, the U.S. visitors met with Shi Zhengli, the head of the research project, who had been publishing studies related to bat coronaviruses for many years. In November 2017, just before the U.S. officials’ visit, Shi’s team had published research showing that horseshoe bats they had collected from a cave in Yunnan province were very likely from the same bat population that spawned the SARS coronavirus in 2003.

“Most importantly,” the cable states, “the researchers also showed that various SARS-like coronaviruses can interact with ACE2, the human receptor identified for SARS-coronavirus. This finding strongly suggests that SARS-like coronaviruses from bats can be transmitted to humans to cause SARS-like diseases. From a public health perspective, this makes the continued surveillance of SARS-like coronaviruses in bats and study of the animal-human interface critical to future emerging coronavirus outbreak prediction and prevention.”

The research was designed to prevent the next SARS-like pandemic by anticipating how it might emerge. But even in 2015, other scientists questioned whether Shi’s team was taking unnecessary risks. In October 2014, the U.S. government had imposed a moratorium on funding of any research that makes a virus more deadly or contagious, known as “gain-of-function” experiments.

As many have pointed out, there is no evidence that the virus now plaguing the world was engineered; scientists largely agree it came from animals. But that is not the same as saying it didn’t come from the lab, which spent years testing bat coronaviruses in animals, said Xiao Qiang, a research scientist at the School of Information at the University of California at Berkeley.

“The cable tells us that there have long been concerns about the possibility of the threat to public health that came from this lab’s research, if it was not being adequately conducted and protected,” he said.

There are similar concerns about the nearby Wuhan Center for Disease Control and Prevention lab, which operates at biosecurity level 2, a level significantly less secure than the level-4 standard claimed by the Wuhan Insititute of Virology lab, Xiao said. That’s important because the Chinese government still refuses to answer basic questions about the origin of the novel coronavirus while suppressing any attempts to examine whether either lab was involved.

Sources familiar with the cables said they were meant to sound an alarm about the grave safety concerns at the WIV lab, especially regarding its work with bat coronaviruses. The embassy officials were calling for more U.S. attention to this lab and more support for it, to help it fix its problems.

“The cable was a warning shot,” one U.S. official said. “They were begging people to pay attention to what was going on.”

No extra assistance to the labs was provided by the U.S. government in response to these cables. The cables began to circulate again inside the administration over the past two months as officials debated whether the lab could be the origin of the pandemic and what the implications would be for the U.S. pandemic response and relations with China.

Inside the Trump administration, many national security officials have long suspected either the WIV or the Wuhan Center for Disease Control and Prevention lab was the source of the novel coronavirus outbreak. According to the New York Times, the intelligence community has provided no evidence to confirm this. But one senior administration official told me that the cables provide one more piece of evidence to support the possibility that the pandemic is the result of a lab accident in Wuhan.

“The idea that is was just a totally natural occurrence is circumstantial. The evidence it leaked from the lab is circumstantial. Right now, the ledger on the side of it leaking from the lab is packed with bullet points and there’s almost nothing on the other side,” the official said.

As my colleague David Ignatius noted, the Chinese government’s original story — that the virus emerged from a seafood market in Wuhan — is shaky. Research by Chinese experts published in the Lancet in January showed the first known patient, identified on Dec. 1, had no connection to the market, nor did more than one-third of the cases in the first large cluster. Also, the market didn’t sell bats.

Shi and other WIV researchers have categorically denied this lab was the origin for the novel coronavirus. On Feb. 3, her team was the first to publicly report the virus known as 2019-nCoV was a bat-derived coronavirus.

The Chinese government, meanwhile, has put a total lockdown on information related to the virus origins. Beijing has yet to provide U.S. experts with samples of the novel coronavirus collected from the earliest cases. The Shanghai lab that published the novel coronavirus genome on Jan. 11 was quickly shut down by authorities for “rectification.” Several of the doctors and journalists who reported on the spread early on have disappeared.

On Feb. 14, Chinese President Xi Jinping called for a new biosecurity law to be accelerated. On Wednesday, CNN reported the Chinese government has placed severe restrictions requiring approval before any research institution publishes anything on the origin of the novel coronavirus.

The origin story is not just about blame. It’s crucial to understanding how the novel coronavirus pandemic started because that informs how to prevent the next one. The Chinese government must be transparent and answer the questions about the Wuhan labs because they are vital to our scientific understanding of the virus, said Xiao.

We don’t know whether the novel coronavirus originated in the Wuhan lab, but the cable pointed to the danger there and increases the impetus to find out, he said.

“I don’t think it’s a conspiracy theory. I think it’s a legitimate question that needs to be investigated and answered,” he said. “To understand exactly how this originated is critical knowledge for preventing this from happening in the future.”"

Or rather, to start fixing it, working towards a Fiscal union. Countries in the Eurozone, especially France under Macron, have been working hard for implementing a Fiscal union for years before the coronavirus crisis. ESM doesn't fix anything in the Eurozone, just mitigates the fallout of this crisis. What Italy, Spain, France are doing now is taking advantage of the crisis in order to push harder for the Fiscal union. And a Fiscal union is essential if the Eurozone is to survive. It's impossible for the Euro to survive without one, such as the one the US has. A Fiscal union should've been implemented from the start of the Euro, from 1998. 20 years later it's painfully evident that a common currency does not work without a common fiscal policy. Without a Fiscal union, the Eurozone collapses. It may be tomorrow, it may be in ten years, but it will. Again, it's a mathematical impossibility for it to survive."

Ultimately these workers (be it cleaners, nurses, doctors, workers who transport things) face massive amount of stress. If there aren’t protective factors in place (organizational support, resources, safety), many will and do suffer and the outcome can continue on even years after the outbreak.

>BRISTOL, N.H. — The coronavirus itself was slow to arrive in Bristol, a lakeside town of 3,300 people. The economic destruction came swiftly.

>By the end of March, with just a few local cases confirmed, gift shops, yoga studios and restaurants had all shut their doors. Hundreds lost jobs, contributing to a record surge in national unemployment claims.

>But at least the Freudenberg factory was running at full strength. The factory, which employs 350 people and makes bonded piston seals and other components for carmakers around the world, has an outsize impact on Bristol’s economy.

>Besides paying employees their salaries and the town taxes, the factory — part of a German industrial conglomerate — is the largest customer of Bristol’s sewage and water systems, a linchpin of the annual budget.

>“Freudenberg is our lifeblood,” Nik Coates, the town administrator, said in an interview on April 2. “If that plant was ever to close or significantly reduce operations, that would put us in a world of hurt.”

>As the coronavirus upends economic life around the world, small towns like Bristol are particularly vulnerable. Freudenberg is its lone large employer. There are just a few national chains — a Dunkin’, a Rite Aid and a Dollar General. And many of the small locally owned businesses depend on seasonal residents, who flock to Newfound Lake during the summer, doubling the town’s population for a few months.

>The community has tried to come together in recent weeks, with residents extending help to one another and trying to support local establishments. But with unemployment ballooning and the threat of worse financial pain to come, neighborly good will is worth only so much over the long term.

>“We’re not rich by any means,” Mr. Coates said. “We’re pretty poor, in fact.”

>On April 3, the bad news started to spread around town. Freudenberg announced it was firing more than 100 people, shutting down its manufacturing of bonded piston seals and looking for additional buyouts. With car sales around the world essentially halted, automakers were suspending operations, and suppliers like Freudenberg were suddenly without revenue to pay workers in places like Bristol.

>The factory has been operating for decades, and is a point of pride for the town. Some years ago, Ford Motor named it one of the carmaker’s best suppliers. The layoffs, however predictable they may have been, were a blow to Bristol’s morale. Several people affected by the layoffs declined to be interviewed, not wanting to upset the biggest employer in town.

>“Managing this is going be difficult for sure,” Mr. Coates said after learning about the layoffs.

>Much of Bristol has now ground to a halt. Restaurants were among the first to close last month. The Homestead, a popular spot where locals splurge on crab-stuffed haddock and lobster rolls, tried to do takeout. But after a week of losing money, Mark McDonough, who owns the Homestead and four other restaurants in the state, shut it down.

>“It’s been a heartbreaking couple of weeks here,” he said. “Companywide, we’ve had to send about 225 people to the unemployment line.”

>Mr. McDonough’s other restaurants, which are in larger cities, continue to serve takeout. Still, sales are down nearly 90 percent, and waiters and dishwashers are out of work. Hoping to help, Mr. McDonough bought his employees gift cards and is serving them free meals.

>Bristol’s best-known local business was also quick to close. TwinDesigns, a gift shop run by the twin brothers Jim and Brad Tonner, features merchandise celebrating a 51-year-old turtle named Diane, who is on display in a small back room. Business normally picks up in the summer, when tourists buy turtle books, puzzles and stuffed animals.

>“If this goes on too long, we won’t survive,” Brad Tonner said. “This is going to kill small-town America.”

>Even those businesses that have remained open are struggling. Dawna Shackley invested her life savings last year to open a graphic design and printing shop, Newfound Impressions. Business was going well, allowing her to hire her first employee in January.

>Now sales have shriveled, from about $20,000 a month before the crisis to just $1,500 in March. Ms. Shackley fired her employee. Her last two printing jobs were both related to the virus: 6,000 brochures about good hygiene for a hospital, and a few banners for the town with information about the crisis.

>“At this point, I’m not sure how long I can last,” Ms. Shackley said. “I figure I’ve got another two or three months.”

>Some businesses are seeing an uptick in sales. In the days after Gov. Chris Sununu ordered nonessential businesses closed, people lined up in the parking lot at Skip’s Sport Shop, the town’s gun store. Hannaford, a grocery store, has been busy, and is offering a senior hour from 6 to 7 some mornings. Aubuchon, a regional hardware chain, is offering curbside pickup.

>Locals have tried to support one another with acts of kindness, however small. Jason Briand, owner of a flooring company, is posting videos that instruct residents how to apply for federal loans. Cathy Bannan Redman, a Bristol resident, organized a team of 60 volunteers to shop for the town’s elderly and immuno-compromised.

>“I come from a long line of helpers,” said Ms. Redman, whose parents volunteered in Bristol over the years.

>Small businesses are trying to do their part, too. The town’s gym, Kilter Fitness, is letting members use its weights at home. Newfound Yoga is streaming classes online. LinCross, a sandwich shop that is still serving takeout, distributed free toilet paper. A distillery donated a gallon jug of hand sanitizer it had made to the Police Department, which was running low.

>“What we lack in monetary resources we make up for many times over in community involvement,” Mr. Coates said.

>Bristol’s lone Chinese restaurant, Very Excellent, initially saw business slump in late February.

>“There was a lot of anti-Chinese sentiment,” said Hector Hsu, the owner, who was born in China and is completing his Ph.D. in aerospace engineering at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology outside Boston, 100 miles south.

>Mr. Hsu opened Very Excellent last year, believing it would be a welcome distraction from his studies. Last month, as the virus spread in Boston, Mr. Hsu decided to move to Bristol full time. He starts each day at Very Excellent, where he obsesses about health and hygiene.

>“I check everyone’s temperature in the morning and yell at them to sanitize,” he said.

>In recent weeks, Very Excellent rolled out a reduced-cost menu of takeout meals, and as people have hunkered down, orders have picked up. Mr. Hsu is now breaking even and hopes to avoid layoffs.

>Still, there are gnawing concerns about the town’s future. Any economic recovery, whenever it does arrive, may take that much longer to reach places like Bristol, which celebrated its bicentennial last year.

>Already, Mr. Coates is concerned that the share of tourism revenue that Bristol receives from the state is going to shrivel. That could affect basic services that keep residents safe and draw visitors to Newfound Lake, which is exceptionally clean and surrounded by forested hills.

>“Running a town is more than just keeping the lights on and paying your employees,” he said. “It’s things like taking care of the beaches and replacing our defibrillators.”

>A major test of Bristol’s resilience will come this summer, when second homes around Newfound Lake fill up. Though Mr. Coates isn’t even sure the town will open its beaches, some year-round residents are already worried that a surge of visitors could spread the virus.

>Yet if the crowds don’t show up, the economy will suffer that much more. “The seasonal businesses will be killed if this isn’t over by the summer,” Mr. Coates said.

>And then there is the Freudenberg factory. In a statement, the company said that the layoffs were temporary, and that it anticipated “that the facility will be back on line as soon as our customers and suppliers, themselves, return to normal operations.”

2020-04-14,RationalAnarchy,Austin,34,https://www.reddit.com/r/Austin/comments/g1gnm7/travis_county_covid19_confirmed_cases_have_risen/fnfigbj/,"**Disclosure:**

First, let me note that there are many limitations to reading this data and taking it as gospel. While we can always use as much information as the city / county are willing to provide, our main hurdle right now is that we don't have information on testing locally. It might be the single most important thing when looking at this data and trying to reach a conclusion, and yet we remain in the dark about it. This is not something that I blame our officials for, it is mainly a product of how this information is reported / collected. The best thing that we can do is make sure our officials know that active testing is a priority for their voters. 

You can [**GO HERE**](https://www.austintexas.gov/contact-us) and find contact information for you district council member. I highly recommend contacting them. The message shouldn't be that we need more information about testing, it should be that testing is one of the most impactful things that we can do. It needs to be aggressive, and widespread. All healthcare workers should be tested routinely. Symptoms or not. Front line workers should be tested routinely. Beyond that we should be testing as many people as possible.

**Commentary:**

Weekend catch up came early? This is starting to look promising boys and girls! Special call out to the Epi Curve at [The City of Austin dashboard](https://austin.maps.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html#/39e4f8d4acb0433baae6d15a931fa984). I've hated on this thing for a while because it is always misleading early on as a virus spreads. Now you can see something new though; notice the ""tail"" on the chart is getting longer. This is a very positive indication as long as testing hasn't slowed down and been compromised. 

There are 92 people hospitalized in the 5 county MSA (metropolitan statistics area) that are confirmed COVID-19 cases. 42 (-7) of those are in the ICU and 30 (+7) are on ventilators. Out of the confirmed COVID-19 cases, the county reports that 158 have recovered. Up 14 from the day before. I'll be looking to include this data in my graphics as soon as we have more data points to work with.

The average daily rate of change since we crossed 100 cases is 11.4%. That is 11 days of continuing to flatten the curve. Good job Austin! Today’s rate of change is 5.1%. I think we are at the point where I feel like I can say that the secondary effects of the UT students going on spring break would have showed up by now. Hopefully that means it was caught early enough and those that were infected were responsible with their actions. 

Lastly, the death toll increased to 14.

Be safe Austin. Take care of each other.

Also, thank you to everyone giving me gold and platinum. It means the world that you find this helpful. Please use that money and donate to a cause that can help the people in our city. I don't need it. Thank you for the support!

Gavin Newsom said Tuesday.

Newsom’s plan is designed to transition the state from the current stay-at-home orders that have ground much of the state’s economy to a halt to a point when there is a vaccine or widespread immunity to the virus.

“This cannot be a permanent state,” Newsom said. “These stay-at-home orders have a profound impact on the economy.”

Newsom says his team is looking at six key parameters to determine when to start reopening the state’s economy:

&#x200B;

* Expanding testing
* Protecting high risk groups, including seniors, the medically vulnerable and people in facilities like nursing homes
* Ensuring hospitals have enough beds and supplies to care for patients
* Progress in developing treatments
* Ability of schools and businesses to support physical distancing
* Ability to decide when to reinstitute stay-at-home orders if needed

&#x200B;

“The most important is our ability to expand our testing,” Newsom said.

The state must be able to test people who show symptoms and identify those in contact with people who test positive to determine how far the virus has spread, according to a presentation provided by Newsom’s office.

For now, [testing in California is still limited because of supply shortages](https://www.sacbee.com/news/politics-government/capitol-alert/article241894601.html).

The second parameter is to protect high risk groups. That includes ensuring seniors and other vulnerable people are able to stay in their homes to avoid catching the disease, Newsom said. It also means ensuring that the state is able to identify and contain outbreaks in places like prisons and nursing homes.

The state’s hospitals also must also be prepared, Newsom said. They must have adequate numbers of beds, ventilators and personal protective gear to care for both COVID-19 patients and people with other medical problems, said Dr. Sonia Angell, who leads the state’s Public Health Department.

Allowing people to move more freely will allow the virus to spread more quickly. The state must be prepared to handle the increased demand expected as stay-at-home orders are eased, she said.

The reopening of the state will be less like flipping a light switch, and more like adjusting a dimmer, Newsom said.

Newsom has said he does not yet plan to announce a “pin-pointed date” for reopening. Instead, he’s focused what evidence state officials will need to see that danger from the virus has waned before they make changes to the orders.

“The question everyone has on our mind is when,” Newsom said. That will depend on the state’s ability to assess the questions laid out in the framework, he said.

As the state does ease up on its orders, the state will still have protections in place. People will be encouraged to wear masks, Angell said.

Restaurants will likely have disposable menus, Newsom said. Customers may have their temperatures checked at the door. Wait staff may wear masks. Schools may have staggered times to reduce contact among students.

“Normal it will not be, at least until we have herd immunity and we have a vaccine,” Newsom said.

“We will be driven by facts, we will be driven by evidence, we will be driven by science, we will be driven by our public health advisers,” Newsom said Monday, previewing Tuesday’s announcement.

Newsom said evidence that the state is slowing the spread of the coronavirus that causes COVID-19 convinced him this is the right time to start planning to reopen the economy. His announcement comes nearly a month after he issued an [executive order](https://covid19.ca.gov/img/N-33-20.pdf) directing [non-essential businesses to close and residents to stay in their homes](https://www.sacbee.com/news/coronavirus/article241358846.html).

On Monday, Newsom said he will work with the governors of Oregon and Washington on a plan for the “incremental release of the stay-at-home” orders. That plan will rely on science, “not political pressure,” he said.

A Monday statement from Newsom, Oregon Gov. Kate Brown and Washington Gov. Jay Inslee did not have specifics about which parts of the economy can reopen first or when that process will start. Instead, it outlined common principles, including that “residents’ health comes first,” that the states must work together and that data must show a that viral transmission is slowing significantly before broad reopening of the states’ economies.

In California, more than 22,000 people have tested positive for the coronavirus, according to the latest data from the state’s Department of Public Health. Nearly 770 have died, Newsom said.

Only about 5,000 confirmed and suspected coronavirus patients are hospitalized, according to the department. That’s far below the 11,000 people the state had predicted would be [hospitalized at this point, according to numbers released Monday](https://www.sacbee.com/news/local/health-and-medicine/article241973806.html).

If those numbers remain low, they will be far under projections from Newsom’s office that indicated the state would need to add more than [50,000 hospital beds by mid-May to accommodate a surge in COVID-19 patients](https://www.sacbee.com/news/politics-government/capitol-alert/article241693326.html).

On Friday, California Health and Human Services Secretary Dr. Mark Ghaly said the state is seeing numbers that fall within its broad projection windows, but toward the lower end - evidence Californians are slowing the spread of the virus by staying home and practicing social distancing.

“This is signaling to us that our peak may not be as high as we planned around and expected,” Ghaly said. “The difference between what we’re seeing today in our hospitals may not be that much different than where we are going to peak in the many weeks to come.”"

That lab was doing research on Bat-based Coronavirus and was extremely close to the Wet Market that China itself claims the virus came from. It was likely an accidental release, either by lax safety standards, selling unneeded research subjects to the market, or a combination of the two.

If you don't believe it and think it's a conspiracy theory, know this. Western Intelligence agencies believe it, or at least suspect it. They've cracked down hard on bio-research assets China holds in the western world, including a Canadian researcher who was being paid hundreds of thousands to help set up that exact same Wuhan lab, China's only max level Biolab.

In addition, two lab assistants were scooped up as well, one was caught at an airport with over a dozen biological samples and the other was found to be a lieutenant in the Chinese Army.

I know your next question. 'But if we already knew, why didn't they just say so?'

Because, public backlash. The backlash may not be directed at Western Governments directly, but Western Intelligence organizations don't like having to yield to public pressure to do something they'd rather not. If this got out, people would demand something serious be done about it. Maybe even a crack down on all Bioweapon related research around the world. And they would really rather not have to do that. They'd rather handle this in political back alleys on their own terms, without having to appease the public.

Again, you clearly know nothing about the scientific process or read reports the WHO actually published.

1. Science is based on evidence. Would it kill you to acknowledge that it's pretty hard to gather evidence on a new disease with a two week incubation period that you haven't developed reliable testing for? Do you even know the amount of evidence needed to reject the null hypothesis in this case? Do you know what a null hypothesis even is?
2. Absence of evidence isn't evidence of absence. You don't have to ""parrot"" anybody to say you don't have enough evidence.
3. The WHO has very early on acknowledged H2H transmission was possible, they just didn't have enough evidence for SUSTAINED H2H.

[""There may have been limited human-to-human transmission of a new coronavirus in China within families, and it is possible there could be a wider outbreak, the World Health Organization (WHO) said on Tuesday.""](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-health-pneumonia-who/who-says-new-china-virus-could-spread-its-warning-all-hospitals-idUSKBN1ZD16J)

> to ""praising"" the CCPs ""handling"" of the outbreak.

Yeah, so did Trump. Is Trump a CCP mouthpiece now?

You can hate CCP's previous fuckups but still acknowledge that their lockdown was actually effective at dealing with the epidemic (once they acknowledged it). Because unlike you zealots, scientists can rationally separate blind hatred and actually analyze things in an unbiased manner.

> The WHO stopped being ""non partisan"" as soon as it started towing the CCP party line.

Someone who clearly has no idea about the scientific basis of WHO's reports is most certainly not qualified to make this kind of judgement."

Coronavirus could make school suck a little bit more than it otherwise would, but you are probably just gonna have to suck it up and make the best of it. Personally I have spent 3 years working in a job that I have no interest in, taking classes part time, to get into grad school. It will be a cold day in hell before I choose to waste another year of my life in a career that I don't care about, when I have the results of my well-executed escape plan sitting right here in front of me. I have worked too hard to get into grad school, as have you and everybody else who was admitted. I'm enrolling in school, and if coronavirus disrupts things, I will deal with that as it happens. Honestly, deferring (which is basically saying you're just going to try again next year) would be a monumentally stupid decision in my opinion.

You are stressed because of coronavirus - that's understandable. Everybody is. Because nobody knows what's going to happen - including that random person who is freaking people out on the internet for no reason. My advice, which *I am* following myself, is to hold steady, try not to get in your own head too much, and *keep moving forward.*

I can't tell you what will happen in the next year or two, because nobody really can. But I think if you make any life decisions like this based on coronavirus, in 5-10 years you are gonna look back and feel really silly about it."

>Fauci has become a household name during the ongoing coronavirus pandemic, with his image being added to doughnuts and bobbleheads.

>Trump then stoked the controversy on Sunday by retweeting a conservative account that called for him to “#FireFauci.”

>The White House issued a statement denying Trump was planning to fire the top public health official, dismissing talk of it as “ridiculous” media speculation.

They ""look fine, feel fine, then you turn around and they're unresponsive,"" said Diana Torres, a nurse at Mount Sinai Hospital in New York, NY, the epicenter of the US pandemic.

""I'm paranoid, scared to walk out of their room.""

It isn't just elderly patients or those with underlying health conditions who can be fine one minute and at death's door the next.

It can happen to the young and healthy, too, according to healthcare staff.

A young woman died unexpectedly while nurse Laurie Douglas was on duty at Our Lady of the Lake Hospital in Baton Rouge, Louisiana.

After 34 years on the job, Ms Douglas said she normally had ""an intuition of who is going to fade and who may improve"".

""But these people are throwing that out the window.

""Last week, she was planning her wedding. This week, her family is planning her funeral,"" she added, referring to the deceased patient.

Patients might enter the hospital with strong oxygen levels and be engaged in happy conversation, said a resident emergency doctor at New York-Presbyterian Hospital, NY, only to be ""gasping for breath"" and intubated a few hours later.

""The scary thing is there are no rules to it.""

Doctors also admitted they were having limited success saving patients that required intubation.

At Columbia University Irving Medical Center, intubated patients were spending around two weeks on ventilators, said chief surgeon Dr Craig Smith in a public newsletter last week.

The resident emergency doctor at New York-Presbyterian, who agreed to talk only under the promise of anonymity, agreed more patients than usual were dying while on the machines.

The exact numbers were still not known while the epidemic rages and with hospitals sometimes working in chaotic conditions.

Some of those hospitals were experimenting with unproven drugs, including the [**anti-malaria medication hydroxychloroquine**](https://www.ausdoc.com.au/news/fda-approves-hydroxychloroquine-emergency-coronavirus-treatment), in the hope of helping patients, the resident said.

""We're essentially throwing the kitchen sink at these patients,"" he admitted.

2020-04-14,merpderpmerp,COVID19,29,https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/g140p6/serological_analysis_of_1000_scottish_blood_donor/fned4aq/,"The post you linked had a good section responding to those who believe this news means we are about to hit herd immunity:

>There are still some people out there saying things like, “Half of us already had the coronavirus, so we’re actually very close to herd immunity,” or, “Lots of you had coronavirus in December and didn’t realize it.” They will often cite the so-called “[Oxford model](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.24.20042291v1.full.pdf+html),” which implied that herd immunity in the U.K. was imminent because only 1 in every 10,000 cases was being detected. Then they’ll tell you about how they (or their godparents’ roommates or whatever) had a really bad cough that just wouldn’t go away a couple weeks before Christmas and wasn’t the CDC saying the December flu season was worse than expected? Surely that was the first wave of the ‘rona!
These people are fools.
We now know, with absolute certainty, that the so-called “Oxford model” is false. We know this because the U.K. has 88,621 confirmed covid cases. If the Oxford model were true, then there would currently be 886 million undetected cases of covid in the U.K., with another 500,000 being infected every day — which represents a problem, because the total population of the U.K. is only 67 million. We are juuuuuust starting to get decent serology tests, and even the sunniest findings suggest that we’re [light-years away](https://twitter.com/JDVance1/status/1249058946767257602) from the optimism of the “Oxford model.”
We now know, with absolute certainty, that there were no cases of covid-19 in the United States before, at the extreme earliest possible date, 5 January 2020. We know this because we’ve decoded the genome of many different covid viruses from all over the world. Since viruses are constantly mutating very slightly, we’ve compared their mutations in order to create a kind of [viral “family tree.”](https://nextstrain.org/narratives/ncov/sit-rep/2020-04-10) Thanks to this “tree,” we know, with a surprising degree of precision, where each strains of the virus came from and when.
The American infections came from many different sources, some in Asia, some in Europe. But our early infections all came from China, and we know that this particular strain of the disease did not leave China until at least 5 January 2020. There’s simply no way anyone in the United States had the coronavirus before then. Even once it arrived here, it started in only a handful of people, mostly on the coasts, and then started to build. So the odds that you, some random suburban Minnesotan who hasn’t been overseas in a decade, had the ‘rona at any time in January, are not quite zero, but let’s just say it’s more likely that you were struck by lightning.
(This is another body blow to the “Oxford model,” which implies that not only are we missing a lot of cases, but that covid arrived on our shores weeks earlier than could possibly be true.)
Minnesota is saying that it now believes that covid has been spreading more widely than previously expected, that it is less lethal than previously believed, and that we are closer to herd immunity than we thought. This is all excellent news. But don’t confuse this with vindication for those who believe this will turn out no worse than a severe flu.
Minnesota [usually has](https://www.health.state.mn.us/diseases/flu/stats/fludeaths.pdf) fewer than 100 flu deaths in a year, although we can lose as many as 500 in especially bad years.
Thanks to its higher lethality, higher threshold for herd immunity, and our complete lack of ability to create artificial herd immunity with vaccines (which keeps influenza contained to about 15% of the population every year), [Minnesota expects](https://mn.gov/covid19/assets/MNmodel_PPT_tcm1148-427787.pdf) to see not fewer than 9,000 deaths if the stay-at-home order is cancelled, expects 22,000 deaths, and fears 36,000. That’s even with “commonsense” social distancing (keep high-risk people at home, don’t have large gatherings) kept in place after stay-at-home ends.
That’s a lot better than the 50,000 Minnseotan deaths we were talking about a week ago. The State has cut its projection in half. But it would have to cut its projection in half six more times to achieve the hundredfold reduction it would take for us to get down to the “just a flu” threshold. (Bear in mind, also, that Gov. Walz reports that the Mayo Clinic and other hospitals have their own models, and they are not as sunny as the state’s.)
Feel free to hope for further downward adjustments, but don’t count on them."

So first off, my boyfriend and I have the same name (I’m gay) so I’ll refer to him by his middle name, Shane. 

Shane and I met in 2015 at an art/ambient show. At the time, I was pretty much a fuck boy looking for a hookup but the more I spoke to Shane the more I kept thinking he was the most amazing thing to ever exist. Within 20 minutes of us meeting each other I could tell that we were both strongly in love with each other (which is odd bc I never been in a real relationship). After talking to him for about an hour he finally tells me that he was married as he introduced me to his wife. As soon as I learned that information (to not be a homewrecker) I tried to keep myself emotionally  distant from Shane. However that was hard bc I would run occasionally run into Shane at the ambient music shows. 

Early last year Shane broke up with his wife, (he told me it was his decision to brake with up her unrelated to me) and in December of last year he asked me out. I believe I’m the first guy Shane has dated...ever....so earlier this year he was pretty closeted. It took him only a couple months to go from closeted to introducing me to all of family members. 


It’s funny bc he was/is everything I didn’t want. A guy with my same first name, a Bernie Supporter (at times a bro), he was a straight married man, he was closeted. Due to the coronavirus and the need to take precautions, I haven’t seen him weeks. I miss him and want to hug him badly. Funny how life works out things like this."

Chen said the last time Taiwan had reported zero new cases was March 9, meaning that Taiwan had gone 36 days with at least one coronavirus case.

The way the virus spreads, it is creating perfect storm conditions for stop and start production due to deep cleaning’s being required after every shutdown due to Coronavirus. It can affect any supplier so only one case would be required to halt production anywhere for a clean to be needed. Again, simplicity is key in keeping food production going. The less raw materials, the less likely a business is to be impacted, but that comes with the caveat that having so few materials could cripple production if there was to be a shortage on one. The scarier thing to me is how normalized the Coronavirus is being in the food industry and what I consider to be inadequate quarantining procedures."

Also, out of pure boredom, i would like to disagree with you on that one. A mother makes a choice to ""create"" those kids. It's essentially what our whole biological purpose as humans is. To procreate.. Being a nurse is a job that entails helping people get better, that are not related to you. It's kind of a big difference.. 

The person who commented was clearly referencing these times of coronavirus. If you think a nurse working during this pandemic, is taking the same risk as a mother who decided to give birth to her kids weeell i don't know what to tell you.. Nurses didn't actively make the coronavirus to appear you know.. It just kinda happened.. They certainly didn't have sex with it!

4/14/2020
First responders in one New Jersey city are being screened to see if they have had coronavirus, and the results come back much faster than a traditional test.

At the Union City Courthouse this week, first responders began a screening process to determine who may have already been exposed to COVID-19. Just five minutes later, the results are back.

Those antibodies show the body’s response to a coronavirus infection. Invictus screened nearly 200 police officers and EMT workers on Friday. The majority tested negative, but at least eight came up positive.

“Those that did actually were sent to do the nasal swab, and they came out negative,” Davidoff said.

Which means the patient had likely been exposed to coronavirus, has since recovered, and should now be immune.

Sure, Trump didn't CAUSE Coronavirus.  But here's what he did do:

\- Went along with the GOP in dismantle a well thought out protocol to deal with pandemics just because it was something Obama did.

\- When person-to-person transmission was established and that there was a statistically significant mortality rate associated with it, he should have done more to minimize the effects to the USA.

\- He should never put Jared Kushner in charge of anything important such as the stockpile and management of ventilators, PPE, and medicine.  This is a big failure in leadership to allow that ghoul to make policy decisions.

The scariest one is the effect on the neurological system. There was a JAMA article from April 10th--neurologic symptoms were seen in 36.4% of patients and were more common in patients with severe infection (45.5%). The one that is most popular in the press has been the loss of smell as an early indicator. It's not totally clear why this happens, but possibly from some sort of inflammation in the epithelium of the nose. 
 
Other neurological symptoms, things like dizziness, headaches, changes in taste, smell and nerve pain have also been described. However, it's not totally clear how many of these occur just because COVID causes patients to be very sick and in the ICU (which causes lots of decompensation of your normal physiology) or because of something unique to COVID. You can imagine that being very short of breath can lead to a lack of oxygen to the brain, causing an almost stroke-like picture. 
 
Also, because these patients tend to get very sick, it does seem like there can be long term heart and lung damage, and there are some studies (below) that show patients who had heart disease before their coronavirus infections were much more likely to show heart damage afterwards. However, some patients with no previous heart disease also showed signs of cardiac damage. We’ll say the above with the key caveat: it depends on how sick you get, and all critical illnesses can cause long term damage. 
 
**TL;DR: It definitely has many effects, the question though, is that because of the virus, or just because it makes you really ill?**

The only action they took was to suspend visa-wavers for tourists. What happened was other countries placed travel restrictions to Korea back in Feb (when Korea was 2nd most infected country in the world), and never lifted those restrictions (mostly consist of suspension of flights, banning Koreans entering to their countries, mandatory 14-day quarantines for anyone arriving from Korea).

I believe this actually limited the virus entering the S.Korea since February.

But it sounds like you have a hard time taking a hard stance with your parents. You need to get over that NOW. Not tomorrow, not in 2 weeks. NOW. 

If they show up, so? Keep doors and windows locked and don't open the door to them. They can stand out on the porch while you ignore them till they leave. Problem solved. If they act butthurt and say you are a meanie, So?  I would say ""Okay. Thanks. Bye now."" Act unbothered. 

All you have taught them so far is that if they pout, they get what they want and you give in. 

FYI I live in American South too and being conservative has NOTHING to do with being cautious about coronavirus or not. I know plenty of democrats doing things they should not be and plenty of Republicans taking it very seriously. So you need to just get out of that mindset right now. Its more about that individual person and if they are the type of person to follow rules or not. 

Here is a hint-your parents are not rule followers. If they show up, do not go to the door. Tell them they can leave the package on the porch and you will get it later and otherwise, shut the blinds and go about your business. 

Personally YOU owe your wife a HUGE apology for your parents barging into her hospital room. She could have had them arrested for that. I think your parents need a consequence for that. Maybe they get a 2 month complete time out with no phone calls, zoom, skypes, visits nothing. 

You should be very very careful playing pass the baby during this pandemic. You, your wife, your other child and new baby need to be at home alone right now. No visitors. Yes even her family. 

All those things you mentioned like the nap with your older child-that was on you. Its your house. Its your child. Go over, snatch your kid away from them and put your kid down for a nap. Done and done. You are in charge. You make the rules. If you don't put your foot down now one day it will blow up and your wife will get so mad she will either divorce you or force you cut your parents off completely. Which is it? 

FYI I made my husband mostly cut off his entire family because he never would stand up to them and they walked all over me and I had enough one day and blew up. If he had been stricter with them all along, he would probably get to still have them around. But he fucked up. Don't make that same mistake."

Tests per capita probably isn't the right metric to use, since the number of tests should also be based on the severity of the outbreak in each state. We're about middle of the pack when it comes to % of positive tests based on total number of tests.

For example, New Jersey is pretty high in per capita tests, but 50% of their test are coming back positive, which means they're woefully behind. Louisiana and Massachusetts are in the top 5 of per capita tests, but ~20% of their tests are coming back positive, about twice California's rate.

Without your help flattening the curve, you are at risk of infection and possibly even ego death.” Tasker went on to describe a method by which people could potentially manifest N95 respirator masks out of pure energy."

I know that everybody is looking for some good news but I’m hesitant to jump to any conclusions about this data. What I need to know prior is how they are calculating this. Hospital are full right now at capacity. We have turned large sections of the hospital That were not patient areas in to patient areas and and they remain full. We are so full that criteria for admission has become more strict than during normal times. Literally if you are able to walk in or not hypoxic you are just not getting admitted. Another thing I’m noticing is that these patients tend to stay much longer than the average heart failure or acute kidney injury case that we tend to get during normal Times. One reason for this is because these patients need to be weaned off of oxygen to room air or at least to a very low liter per minute level of oxygen before going home. So whenever I see these statistics indicating that hospitalizations are dropping I’m wondering if this may be a sort of bottleneck effect. One of my roles in the hospital is overseeing discharge planning and I can say for certain we are discharging much fewer patients then we do during normal times due to the challenges in medically managing patients with coronavirus

I don't think mainstream media could be making this any more obvious. Worldwide there is an obvious concern about 5G and its impact on health. Doctors and scientists around the world wouldn't be signing petitions if it wasn't. Governments around the world wouldn't be putting the roll out of 5G on hold if they weren't concerned. What the mainstream media is trying to do now is divert the attention away from the legitimate concern and direct it towards this conspiracy theory that links 5G to the Coronavirus. Is there a subset of people that believe 5G is causing the Coronavirus? Probably. There's a certain number of people that will believe in anything. Is there a subset of people that believe 5G and alleged health effects are similar to the coronavirus? Yes, probably more so than the former. But the greatest argument around 5G is just the health effects. 

5G is a concern. But don't let them muddy the waters by saying that the concern is that it's causing the coronavirus. Because this is very easy to defeat. Not too many people believe that the 5G is causing a virus. If anything people believe that some of the health effects caused by 5G could imitate the symptoms of the Coronavirus. But more importantly people are just generally worried about the health effects of 5G.

What they are trying to do is have the people think that if someone has a concern about 5G they are a conspiracy nut who thinks the coronavirus is caused by 5G."

The treatment being carried out on patients at the University Hospital of Wales (UHW) in Cardiff uses the blood plasma taken from people who have already recovered from Covid-19.

Their plasma is then transfused into other patients with the coronavirus to help them fight the infection more quickly.

Recovered patients are being invited by letter, if eligible, by Public Health Wales to donate blood to the scheme.

Senior professional advisor to the Chief Medical Officer, Dr Gill Richardson, said: ""Convalescent plasma is plasma that is collected from patients who have recovered from disease, in this case Covid-19.

""Plasma from patients who have recovered from the virus will contain antibodies that a patient's immune system has produced to fight the virus. This can be transfused to patients whose immune systems are struggling to develop their own antibodies.

""The Welsh Government has worked at speed with our expert scientists at the Welsh Blood Service, the Department of Immunology at University Hospital of Wales, critical care consultants and Public Health Wales to launch this innovative scheme.

""In the absence of any current vaccine or antiviral therapy, it has significant potential to aid the recovery of patients.""

**Information about the graphs:**

NZ Confirmed and Probable Cases (First 2 Graphs):

* BLUE LINE - The total Confirmed and Probable cases. Note that prior to 24 March this was only Confirmed cases.
* ORANGE LINE - I'm using this [information on the growth rate of COVID-19 by country](https://ourworldindata.org/coronavirus#growth-of-cases-how-long-did-it-take-for-the-number-of-confirmed-cases-to-double) \- This is based on WHO data. Australia is at 4 days which is what I am using as the reference given our similarities in response and geography/population density.
* RED LINE - Shows doubling every 4 days from the 102nd case.
* Overlays show timing of important events such as Alert Level changes
* Please be clear the orange and red lines are **not an extrapolation of the data or a prediction** of what will happen in NZ. They are purely a reference point based on what would happen if we doubled every 4th day from the first case (orange) or 102nd case (red).

Counters:

* Today's current number and the change from yesterday below in brackets:

Linked to Overseas Travel (Donut):

* This is based on the the info in the detailed data tables.

Total vs New Scatter (Log):

* This graph is a scatter plot of the daily increase (y axis) vs the total number of cases (x axis). It is a NZ specific plot of the graph discussed in [this link](https://youtu.be/54XLXg4fYsc?t=171)
* The red and green dots correspond in time with the overlays on the first two graphs.

Case Distribution by Age Group:

* From the detailed case data

Case Distribution by Sex:

* From the detailed case data

Case Increase (% Over Previous Day):

* This tracks the % today's numbers were an increased out of the total yesterday

Cases by DHB:

* The first graph is the number of cases for each DHB area. This is how MoH categorise the cases so I am unable to provide a detailed location breakdown.
* The second graph is population adjusted. This will loosely indicate the burden on that DHB.

Cases vs Tests:

* This graph shows the cumulative number of cases and tests to the given date.

Positive Test Result (% to Date):

* This is a different view of the Cases vs Tests graph. It is also calculated as the % to-date
* I may change this to a daily % Confirmed out of # Tests if we continue to get reliable test numbers.

Transmission Type %:

* This is tracking the change in classification of the transmission type
* MoH expect most of the ""Under Investigation"" cases to become Community Transmission

Case Breakdown:

* This is a stack of Recovered Cases, Deaths, Cases in Hospital, and the remainder are still ""Active"". **UPDATE: I've switched the stack up due to popular demand.**

Daily Testing:

* This shows the number of tests, and new cases each day, along with the percentage of positives against that number of tests. 

Total Arrivals by Date:

* Plot of total arrivals into NZ since 1 March 2020.

* Here is where you can find [information on NZ current cases and their flight details etc](https://www.health.govt.nz/our-work/diseases-and-conditions/covid-19-novel-coronavirus/covid-19-current-cases).
* **With luck we will continue see a tail off from April 2** now that [NZ's borders are closed](https://www.stuff.co.nz/national/politics/120423903/coronavirus-prime-minister-to-make-announcement-on-border-controls) and we are in to Alert Level 4. The PM has stated that we should be prepared to continue to see increases for 10-12 days (3-5 April)
* MoH have changed their reporting. From 24 March total numbers now include ""Probable"" causes on the assumption they will become Confirmed.

* [Radio NZ's fantastic timeline](https://shorthand.radionz.co.nz/coronavirus-timeline/index.html)

**Here are some other visualisations that I think are worth referring to:**

* I consider [this plot is the best visualisation of the European CDC data that compares countries](https://www.visualcapitalist.com/infection-trajectory-flattening-the-covid19-curve/) against doubling rates from the 100th case.
* [Our World in Data](https://ourworldindata.org/coronavirus) have loads of great live graphs to play with
* The [Johns Hopkins dashboard](https://gisanddata.maps.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html#/bda7594740fd40299423467b48e9ecf6) is also pretty cool to look at current stats around the world. It is based on the [Johns Hopkins data set](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19).
* This is another [useful way to compare the case trajectory](https://aatishb.com/covidtrends/?country=Australia&country=France&country=Germany&country=Italy&country=New+Zealand&country=South+Korea&country=Spain&country=Taiwan) of various countries.
* The [European CDC dataset](https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/publications-data/download-todays-data-geographic-distribution-covid-19-cases-worldwide) is also helpful for those building graphs and wanting to compare countries.

The tweet led to denouncements that Trump was playing politics with COVID-19 supplies.

>Many accused Trump and his administration of ignoring official requests from Colorado Gov. Jared Polis, a Democrat, for medical supplies. Polis has for some time called the situation in Colorado “dire” and “far worse than we imagined.” He said his state’s “comparatively smaller population” resulted in “staggering increases in cases and deaths … not fully registering in national models” which attempt to track the virus’s spread. Polis issued his requests for supplies on March 28th to Vice President Mike Pence through a letter carbon copied to Sens. Michael Bennet and Cory Gardner.  

>Sen. Gardner is the Republican to whom Trump gave a shout out in his tweet.

>Though Trump said he was responding to a request by Gardner for ventilators, a search of Gardner’s website reveals neither a press release nor a letter requesting ventilators from the Trump Administration.  Law&Crime reached out to the office of Sen. Gardner to clarify whether he did, indeed, request ventilators.  We have not yet received a response.

>Trump said during a daily coronavirus press conference early Wednesday evening that Gardner phoned in the request.  Trump made that comment after saying he wasn’t getting calls seeking ventilators.

>“I just sent 100 ventilators to Colorado, and that was great.  A senator there, who’s a terrific senator, Cory, Cory Gardner, called me last night and said, ‘could you get 100 ventilators for Colorado,’ and we just sent them out, and they’ll be there very shortly,” Trump continued.  “It looks like we’re in great shape from the ventilator standpoint,” Trump later added.

>The focus of Sen. Gardner’s COVID-19 efforts appears to be on economic matters involving farmers, the National Guard, FEMA grants, and similar concerns. Gardner also requested an investigation into why some ventilators in the national stockpile have apparently not worked properly.  Gardner lodged his demand for a review of those ventilators with the Principal Deputy Inspector General at the Department of Health and Human Services, Christi Grimm.

>Gardner has also argued that rural hospitals should receive coronavirus-related support because they could take patients from stressed and crowded urban hospitals. Gardner, furthermore, has admitted that the national stockpile did not have enough material to combat COVID-19.

>Some assessments indicate Gardner is at risk of losing his senate seat to Democratic challenger John Hickenlooper, Colorado’s former governor.  Others have ranked the Colorado senate seat occupied by Gardner as among those to watch this fall for a possible change in power.

>With this as a backdrop, Gardner promptly thanked Trump for sending the ventilators.

>**Gardner voted against impeaching Trump in February. In a statement at the time, he decried “partisan accusations, investigations, and endless acrimony.”**

Do keep this in mind in november."

* Canadian data from virihealth.com (from PHAC & provinces), USA data from coronavirus.1point3acres.com, Other national data was from WHO sitrep 84.
* I am not an epidemiologist. I'm not a government employee. I don't even play a doctor on TV. I just like numbers.

This data is admittedly imperfect: testing is incomplete, there is a test backlog, and reporting is not completely fluid.  This is too simplistic a model for realistic projection, given all of the unknowns and variables of such a complex system.  That said, I'll continue to track this, to see where it goes.

Today's data notes:  

* Provincially, QC and ON new cases continue to climb at a steady pace. AB incoming have been higher than normal the last 3 days. NS leads the growth rate of existing cases to known cases, continuing a horse-race with ON. MB, NB and ~~NB~~ **NL** had 0 new positives today, PEI has had no new positives since Apr8. Nunavut continues to have none of it. 
* Nationally, 1922 are hospitalized (+59 from yesterday, a new high), and 571 are in ICU (-4 from yesterday's high water mark of 575). As these numbers climb, the burden on our healthcare workers will increase. Godspeed and thanks to them as they stand on guard for thee and me. 
* A heartbreaking record 123 deaths today, first 3-digit number: 75 in QC, 43 in ON. The national total is 903 (3.34% of known positives. This is a little high, but we've had a lot of senior care homes hit. Also, this is not really the mortality rate, since that won't be known until all those infected are recovered or not, and may vary significantly if the healthcare system is overwhelmed).
* People tested (+17,485) = 462,841 (1.23% of the population). Testing up about 650 from yesterday.
* Tested positive (+1383) = 27,063 (5.85% of those tested). The cumulative hit rate climbs slightly from 5.78% yesterday, rising 21 days in a row. The higher hit rate is concerning, particularly in QC(10.4% overall, 11.75% today) and ON (7.2% overall, 11.3% today). More testing must be done to improve confidence in the latest numbers of positives. 
* Test backlog - 5151 today, up  from 4530 yesterday. 
* Recovered (+477) = 8235 (30.43% of known positives). After passing 50% recovered (of known cases) yesterday, AB regressed back down to 48.9% today. NL, SK, NB, PEI, and BC remain above 50% recovered. Nice! However, this proportion could regress for anyone with incoming positives. Even PEI at 92% recovered has not had 2 infection cycles without a new case, and with silent transmission, I don't know what criteria would be required for an ""all clear"" signal. 
* Known active = 17,925 (Total positives - recovered - deceased). The unknowns are unknown. 
* The bump in China's number @ day 29 was due to a change in the way their cases were categorized.
* The growth rate appears in cases seems to be slowing. Higher doubling time is better. March16 - doubling rate= every 2.84 days; March23=2.74 days; Mar30=4.21 days; Apr6=8.19 days. Currently over 10 days. Curve is flattening, but not flat. 
* World notes: USA passes 600K positive cases and 26K deaths today, with 4 states >1K deaths. UK leads Euro deaths today with 717. Italy passed 20K deaths. Turkey +4K, passes 60K cases. Russia up 2.7K to 21K. India passes 10K cases.

Apparently these guys were chanting ""Khaana do ya ghar jaane do"". Not sure if true, but if it is, that's very sad and totally understandable. They **may** die of Coronavirus but they **will** die of starvation. 

Plus it's a natural human tendency to want to go home in scary times. Remember that many are illiterate and won't know things about the virus like fatality rate etc. They will just know that sheher mein virus hai.

Also many of these people send money home to families in UP Bihar. Even if they get food here, people back home must be starving. Answer me honestly - if your mom back in your hometown was starving wouldn't you want to go back home, virus or not?"

Let's say I am a doctor and I have two patients and test their fasting blood sugar. We get the results back and I immediately see their results are both 105 putting them in the pre-diabetic category. So I can go and prescribe metformin and all that shit. But the wierd thing is they're nothing alike. One patient leads a sedentary lifestyle, freely admits to subsisting on junk food, and his body fat has him set for being trapped in his apartment for 6or 7 months of coronavirus quarantine induced starvation. The other patient exercises 7 days a week, deadlifts smart cars, and has single digit body fat.

So we look deeper. I test their fasting insulin. Your body, assuming functioning pancreas, always produces insulin. And it produces it in part for homeostatic function to balance sugar in the blood and cellular demand. So we get the results. One comes back at 22.0 and the other comes back at 3.2. The sedantary guy has more than 6 times the amount of insulin floating around than the fit guy. The sedentary guy is very strongly resistant to insulin, whereas the fit guy is *fantastically* sensitive to it, only a tiny amount of insulin is required to maintain that homeostatic balance.

The mechanisms behind this are interesting. But it illuminates something scary about relying heavily on glucose and glucose related targets as a diagnostic tool. Maybe our junk food guy wasn't as fat or maybe he went on a diet.  Maybe his blood sugar comes back at 90. Maybe its someone entirely different, either way: Test his insulin and it comes back....22... this patient is still very insulin resistant and yet is still in the window where his body/pancreas can keep up with that resistance. Relying on his blood sugar or any metric based of it like a1c, does not show us he is on a bad road.


105 for our bodybuilder is perfectly healthy, while its unhealthy for the sedantary person, and the third one is *clearly* unhealthy despite a 'normal' blood glucose reading.

Moral of the story: test your insulin. Everyone should do an insulin test. It can illuminate so many things about your health that it should be part of everyone's regular Healthcare screenings and its a travesty that its not."

>(CNN)Beijing is facing a diplomatic crisis in Africa after reports of alleged coronavirus-related discrimination against African nationals in China sparked widespread anger across the continent.

>African students and expatriates in the southern Chinese city of Guangzhou were last week subject to forced coronavirus testing and arbitrary 14-day self-quarantine, regardless of recent travel history, amid heightened fears of imported infections.

>Large numbers of African nationals were also left homeless, after being evicted by landlords and rejected by hotels in the city.

>Having reportedly contained the virus within China, concerns have grown in recent weeks over a so-called second wave, brought into the country by overseas travelers.

>In Africa, however, governments, media outlets and citizens reacted angrily to the apparent rise in anti-foreigner sentiment, as videos of Africans being harassed by police, sleeping on the streets or being locked into their homes under quarantine circulated online.

>On Saturday, the front page of Kenya's biggest newspaper lead with the headline, ""Kenyans in China: Rescue us from hell,"" as a member of the country's parliament called for Chinese nationals to leave Kenya immediately. TV stations in Uganda, South Africa and Nigeria also ran stories on the alleged mistreatment.

>The fallout threatens to undermine China's diplomatic efforts in Africa. In recent years, African nations have become key diplomatic and trade partners to Beijing, with China's trade with Africa worth $208 billion in 2019, according to official figures from China's General Administration of Customs.

>In a statement released Sunday, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian denied China had been singling out foreigners.

>""We are still facing great risks of imported cases and domestic resurgence. Particularly, as the pandemic spreads all over the world, imported cases are causing mounting pressure,"" said Zhao.

>""All foreigners are treated equally. We reject differential treatment, and we have zero tolerance for discrimination,"" he added.

>A breakdown in relations

>African countries are often characterized as being the weaker partner in bilateral relations with Beijing, with US officials repeatedly warning nations to be wary of so-called Chinese debt trap diplomacy, in which countries are forced to hand over key assets to service loans they can't make repayments on impairing their sovereignty.

>But in recent days, African governments have been quick to demand answers from Beijing on the treatment of their citizens.

>On Saturday, Nigerian lawmaker Oloye Akin Alabi posted a video on Twitter of the Chinese ambassador to Nigeria, Zhou Pingjian, being grilled by a Nigerian politician over the mistreatment of Africans in Guangzhou.

>During the exchange, Zhou is made to watch videos of Africans allegedly being mistreated in China. Oloye accompanied the video with the message that his government would ""not tolerate maltreatment of Nigerians in China.""

>The governments of Uganda and Ghana also reportedly summoned their respective Chinese ambassadors over what the Ghanaians called ""the inhumane treatment being meted out."" Meanwhile, the Foreign Ministry of South Africa, which is currently chairing the African Union, said it was ""deeply concerned"" by the reports.

>On Saturday, in perhaps the most serious sign of continent-wide discontent, Moussa Faki Mahamat, chairperson of the African Union Commission, tweeted that he had invited the Chinese ambassador to the AU to personally discuss the allegations of mistreatment.

>The Chinese reaction

>On Sunday, Chinese Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Zhao Lijian responded to the crisis, promising that provincial authorities would attach ""great importance"" to the concerns of some African countries and work to improve quarantine measures, including providing special accommodation for foreigners required to undergo medical observation.

>However, echoing city officials in Guangzhou, Zhao did not address specific accusations that authorities had enforced a policy of mandatory testing and a 14-day quarantine on all Africans, even when they had not left China in recent months; had not been in contact with a known Covid-19 patient; had just completed a 14-day isolation; or had certificates to show they were virus-free.

>Chinese state media had previously reported that five Nigerians tested had positive for the virus in Guangzhou.

>Local police said on Sunday that all foreigners must strictly abide by Chinese laws and those who refuse to show identification when requested by police would face punishment. Suspicions abound that many Africans are overstaying their visas in Guangzhou, where officials said they counted 4,553 Africans legally living in the city as of last week.

>On Sunday, the state-owned Global Times broke its silence on the continued diplomatic fallout, writing that ""viral reports in Western media alleging Africans are being discriminated against and badly treated in the city"" were ""used by some Western media to provoke the problems between China and African countries.""

>In recent years, legions of Chinese diplomats have joined Twitter, a social media platform that is banned in China.

>In Africa, CNN counted at least 25 accounts belonging to Chinese diplomats or consulates. But those Twitter accounts, which have repeatedly championed China's aid efforts in Africa in recent weeks, had been notably quiet on the issue of the African diaspora in Guangzhou.

>After Zhao's statement on Sunday many began to tweet his comments.

>Lina Benabdallah, assistant professor in politics at Wake Forest University, specializing in China-Africa relations, said that the ""delicate"" nature of the issue required a ""coordinated response,"" as Chinese diplomats would need to prevent a backlash against the more than 1 million Chinese currently living in Africa.

>""De-escalation in that sense is probably a priority,"" she said. ""It's a sensitive thing.""

>People to people relations

>By the end of the weekend, most of the displaced Africans in Guangzhou, mainly traders and students who make up China's largest African population, had found shelter, according to people CNN spoke to in the city.

>Armies of volunteers who had assembled on WeChat, a Chinese messaging app, had rallied to connect Africans with landlords and hotels who would still accept foreigners. Others had been rounded up by local authorities and taken into quarantine at government-assigned hotels, according to Africans and volunteers who spoke to CNN.

>""They (the authorities) just don't want them on the street,"" said one volunteer, who asked not to be named for fear of government reprisals.

>Shen Shiwei, a non-resident fellow at the Institute of African Studies at Zhejiang Normal University, said people-to-people relations were a linchpin of China's relationship with Africa, and needed to be protected.

>Shen called on Chinese officials to improve communication with the African diaspora in Guangzhou, suggesting signs in English and local languages to help explain decisions in policing. ""I think there are two sides to every story,"" he said.

>Hannah Ryder, a British-Kenyan who used to work for the United Nations in China and is now CEO of a Kenyan owned company in Beijing, said these types of incidents can have a massive impact on how people in Africa view China. ""If they are not handled properly they can result in far larger consequences than people sleeping on the street. They can have repercussions on international relations, trade and even diplomacy,"" said Ryder.

>""As China has been the first to deal with and recover from Covid-19 the world can learn a lot from China's experience,"" she said.

>""I hope that when it comes to virus-related xenophobia, China can show leadership on the best way to tackle it and be an example the world can follow.""

In terms of Coloradans doing their part, for the past almost 2 weeks, I don't agree.  I've seen a lot more people out on the road as opposed to the first 2 weeks (I work part time delivering pharmaceuticals to hospice patients, so I have witnessed this first hand).  Trail head parking lots are packed, and just more people out.  I know exercising outside is allowed, but Polis has specifically stated you should be going for walks from your home, not driving across county lines to go hiking.  This is stated because what if you get into a car accident, or get hurt while hiking?  Those first responders are being taken away from coronavirus patients, and the people who are hurt could be infected, not know it if they're not showing symptoms, and then infecting other people.

Coloradans are getting cabin fever and believe that because we're past the curve, they don't have to be as strict, and I am worried in a couple of weeks there will be another spike because of those people's actions."

There’s been a lot of media fuss about a (non-peer-reviewed) paper that claimed they found 1/3 of recovered people to have low antibody titers. You should look very skeptically at that paper, and even more skeptically at the media response, which draws exactly the opposite conclusion from what this group says - because even this group says that two-thirds of patients had high titers of antibodies against the virus. So obviously, at the very least the majority of recovered people are immune. 

Second, this group is the only group that finds that many people with low antibody titers, which makes you wonder about their testing. Looking at their paper, we see that it’s not peer reviewed (it’s a preview). We also see that they made up their own antibody test, instead of using an agreed standard, and never validate their test to show that it’s actually measuring something meaningful. 

So we can be quite skeptical about this paper (even though, again, it says that the majority of recovered people do have high titers and are probably protected). What do other groups find? 

Other groups do find occasional people with low titers, but far fewer than here. For example, [Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2−Specific Antibody Responses in Coronavirus Disease 2019 Patients](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/26/7/20-0841_article) found that all of 19 tested recoverees were antibody positive, and [Detection of antibodies against SARS‐CoV‐2 in patients with COVID‐19](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jmv.25820) found 60 of 60 positive. Another paper I just read but can’t find again found 37 of 38 positive. 

Because I know people are going to parrot the repeat-infection claim, few scientists are convinced that those repeat-positives are truly reinfections. Rather, they’re probably false negative tests taken between two true positives. We know that false negatives are fairly common with the available tests, so this is by far the simplest explanation.

>	There remains a lot of uncertainty, but experts TIME spoke with say that it’s likely the reports of patients who seemed to have recovered but then tested positive again were not examples of re-infection, but were cases where lingering infection was not detected by tests for a period of time. ... Instead, testing positive after recovery could just mean the tests resulted in a false negative and that the patient is still infected. “It may be because of the quality of the specimen that they took and may be because the test was not so sensitive,” explains David Hui ...

—[Can You Be Re-Infected After Recovering From Coronavirus? Here's What We Know About COVID-19 Immunity](https://time.com/5810454/coronavirus-immunity-reinfection/)

So to summarize a bunch of other stuff (look through my previous posts for many, many references):

* even the most pessimistic (unvalidated) tests say most people are immune
* most tests find over 90% of recovered people are immune
* so-called reinfection almost certainly is simply bad tests
* SARS and MERS gave decent to good immunity
* experimental vaccines against SARS and MERS have given great immunity
* convalescent serum transfer gives protection against disease, showing that immunity is protective"

""President Trump stepped to the lectern Monday on a day when the coronavirus death toll in the United States ticked up past 23,000. He addressed the nation at a time when unemployment claims have shot past 15 million and lines at food banks stretch toward the horizon.

Yet in the middle of this deadly pandemic that shows no obvious signs of abating, the president made clear that the paramount concern for Trump is Trump — his self-image, his media coverage, his supplicants and his opponents, both real and imagined.

“Everything we did was right,” Trump said, during a sometimes hostile 2½ -hour news conference in which he offered a live version of an enemies list, brooking no criticism and repeatedly snapping at reporters who dared to challenge his version of events.

Trump has always had a me-me-me ethos, an uncanny ability to insert himself into the center of just about any situation. But Monday’s coronavirus briefing offered a particularly stark portrait of a president seeming unable to grasp the magnitude of the crisis — and saying little to address the suffering across the country he was elected to lead.

At one point — after praising himself for implementing travel restrictions on China at the end of January and griping about being “brutalized” by the press — Trump paused to boast with a half-smirk, “But I guess I’m doing okay because, to the best of my knowledge, I’m the president of the United States, despite the things that are said.”

The news conference began when Trump turned to Anthony S. Fauci, the nation’s top infectious-disease specialist, and asked him to “say a few words before we go any further.” With that, Fauci stood and offered a not-quite-apology for comments he made over the weekend to CNN’s Jake Tapper, in which he confirmed that he and other health experts had made mitigation recommendations to Trump as early as the third weekend of February and said that earlier mitigation “could have saved lives.”


On Monday, Fauci tried to walk back his comments, saying he had been responding to a “hypothetical” and had not intended to criticize the president, whom he praised for implementing the recommendations of public health officials like himself.

“That was the wrong choice of words,” said Fauci, whose relationship with the president has been tense at times.

One reporter asked him if he was speaking “voluntarily” or at the behest of the president.

“Everything I do is voluntarily,” Fauci said. “Please don’t even imply that.”

Next, Trump played a propaganda-style video that he said had been pulled together by White House aides earlier in the day. In a short hagiography more in line with a political event than a presidential news conference, clips critical of the media were interspersed with footage of loyalists praising the president.

“The president has been outstanding through all this,” Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis (R) said in the video. “The vice president has been outstanding. Members of the coronavirus task force very responsive.”

Since the pandemic began, Trump’s almost-daily news conferences have increasingly taken on the feel of campaign rallies — a simulacrum of the raucous, Keep-America-Great-fests he has had to forgo amid the global contagion.

And Monday, he brought many of those trademark campaign moments into the briefing room.

“You know, I don’t mind controversy,” the president said, offering something of a guiding life principle. “I think controversy is a good thing, not a bad thing.”
National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases Director Anthony S. Fauci, at Monday’s briefing, said that he had not meant to criticize Trump in a weekend interview and that he had used “the wrong choice of words.”

He also criticized “sleepy Joe Biden,” the presumptive Democratic nominee, because Biden, he said, had previously criticized him, and jousted with the “fake news.”

Shortly after Trump played the video, CBS’s Paula Reid pressed him on how his administration had not used the month of February to ready itself for the coming virus, after sharply limiting travel from China.

“You didn’t use it to prepare hospitals, you didn’t use it to ramp up testing,” Reid said, before Trump cut her off, calling her “disgraceful.”

Reid forged ahead. “What did you do with the time that you bought, the month of February?” she asked, as Trump talked over her. “That video has a gap — the entire month of February. . . . What did your administration do in February with the time that your travel ban bought you?”

“A lot. A lot,” said Trump, without offering any specifics, before turning his frustration back on Reid.

“You know you’re a fake,” he said.

Trump says he has 'total authority' to reopen the economy, not the states

At another moment, seemingly eager to assert his dominance over the nation’s governors, Trump declared incorrectly, “When somebody is the president of the United States, the authority is total.”

Later, CNN’s Kaitlan Collins followed up: “You said when someone is president of the United States, their authority is total. That is not true. Who told you that?”

The president declined to answer, saying, “The governors need us” before abruptly silencing Collins with a sharp, “Enough.”"

4/14/2020
Ten U.S. governors on the east and west coasts banded together on Monday in two regional pacts to coordinate gradual economic reopenings as the coronavirus crisis finally appeared to be ebbing.

Announcements from the New York-led group of Northeastern governors, and a similar compact formed by California, Oregon and Washington state, came as President Donald Trump declared any decision on restarting the U.S. economy was up to him.

New York Governor Andrew Cuomo said he was teaming up with five counterparts in adjacent New Jersey, Connecticut, Delaware, Pennsylvania and Rhode Island to devise the best strategies for easing stay-at-home orders imposed last month to curb coronavirus transmissions.

The announcements came as signs emerged that the crisis had peaked. At least 1,500 new U.S. fatalities were reported on Monday, below last week’s running tally of roughly 2,000 deaths every 24 hours. Likewise, the number of additional confirmed cases counted on Monday, about 23,000, was well below last week’s trend of 30,000 to 50,000 new cases a day.

.

>The World Health Organization warned the US and other countries about the risk of human-to-human transmission of Covid-19 as early as 10 January, and urged precautions even though initial Chinese studies at that point had found no clear evidence of that route of infection.

.

>The January WHO tweet reported “**preliminary** investigations conducted by the Chinese authorities have found no clear evidence of human-to-human transmission”.


.

>But in the same week top WHO officials were briefing health leaders around the world to keep looking out for signs of such transmission, and to take precautions as if it was already happening.


.


>The WHO declared a “public health emergency of international concern” on 30 January, a day before Trump banned non-American residents who had been to China from entering the US.

Yeah, the Trump/USA government is shifting the blame to WHO.

**Preliminary**: denoting an action or event preceding or done in preparation for something fuller or more important.

And when on Jan 20, 2020, when new evidences appeared, a transmission from patient to doctor and family member to family member was observed and showed there was human-to-human transmission, China reported to the WHO.

>(CNN)Former President Barack Obama will endorse Joe Biden on Tuesday, a source familiar with the plans tells CNN.

>Obama will make the endorsement of his former vice president in a video message, offering why he believes Biden is the candidate needed at this moment of crisis in America, a person close to the former president says.

>The endorsement reunites the former running mates and positions Obama, whose endorsement of Biden was seen as a forgone conclusion once Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders dropped out of the race last week, to be one of Biden's most powerful surrogates in the race against President Donald Trump.

>It also marks the public re-emergence of Obama into the political arena. The former president kept a low public profile throughout much of the Democratic nomination fight, but he was active behind the scenes.

>Two people familiar with Obama's video say it is intended as more than a simple endorsement of his friend and former vice president. His message is designed to address this particular moment in America and around the world, particularly in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic.

>Obama will acknowledge how frightened people are and explain why he believes Biden is the right person to lead the country in this time of crisis, the sources said, and the candidate who must defeat Trump.

>Obama will also speak directly to progressives, praising the spirit of their movement before outlining why he believes they should embrace Biden's candidacy. The former president will also offer a full-throated praise of Sanders and noting what his candidacy has meant for the pursuit of liberal ideals.

>Obama in November said he had spoken to all of the candidates during the campaign, often giving them advice both before they announced their bid and after they dropped out. Advisers to the former president said his advice was often the same: Consider why you believe you should be president, what impact it will have on your family and whether you can actually win.

>Visit CNN's Election Center for full coverage of the 2020 race

>""We have a field of very accomplished, very serious and passionate and smart people who have a history of public service,"" Obama said at a private fundraiser in late 2019. ""Whoever emerges from the primary process, I will work my tail off to make sure they are the next president.""

>Obama had long said he would get behind the eventual nominee, but the former president's deep affection for Biden was well known to all those who ran against the former vice president this year. Biden even jokingly posted an homage to Obama on ""Best Friends Day"" in 2019, featuring a friendship bracelet that featured the names ""Joe"" and ""Barack"".

>That relationship, though, did not keep Obama from giving counsel to other candidates.

>As Sanders worked to determine the future of his campaign, Obama and the Vermont senator spoke multiple times, a source familiar with the conversation told CNN. Sanders endorsed Biden on Monday in a livestream, pledging to help him defeat President Trump.

>""We need you in the White House. I will do all that I can to see that that happens, Joe,"" Sanders said to Biden.

>In the few moments where Obama did speak out about the race, the former president warned voters of worrying too much about the bruising nature of a primary, reminding them that he and then-Sen. Hillary Clinton had a tough primary in 2008.

>And the former president told the candidates to avoid going so far left that they go beyond where voters actually are.

>""My one cautionary note is I think it is very important for all the candidates who are running at every level to pay some attention to where voters actually are,"" Obama said in November, specifically saying he doesn't think candidates should be ""deluded into thinking that the resistance to certain approaches to things is simply because voters haven't heard a bold enough proposal.""

>It is this period of the campaign, however, when some supporters of other candidates, especially Sanders backers, feel like their hopes were dashed once their candidates dropped out, where Obama's team believes the former president can be most useful.

>""He is uniquely positioned to galvanize the party around the nominee and increase voter turnout so that a Democrat is successful in the general election,"" Valerie Jarrett, a longtime Obama adviser, told CNN in March.

>Jarrett said that they believed it was ""important"" to let all the candidates ""stand on their own two feet"" but that once a nominee was selected, Obama would use the support he enjoyed from a ""a broad spectrum of the Democratic Party, both the progressive and moderate wings"" to bring the factions together.

>Obama's popularity inside the Democratic Party was clear throughout the presidential campaign. A number of candidates ran ads featuring either images of Obama or the former president's voice, including Sanders, who had in the past been critical of Obama.

>But the extent with which Obama can reach out to Sanders' supports is questionable, given many of the liberal leader's most vocal proponents see the former president as someone who squandered the movement he built in 2008. Even former Obama aides question how successful he will be in reaching Sanders' more diehard proponents.

>Biden was not shy about his admiration for Obama throughout the 2020 campaign. Biden often described himself as an ""Obama-Biden"" Democrat and, in speeches across the country, would calmly refer to the former President as ""Barack,"" sometimes before correcting himself and calling him the president.

>The former vice president even used part of his first major rally as a presidential candidate in 2019 to laud his former boss as ""an extraordinary man.""

>""I watched up close, his character, his courage, his vision,"" Biden said. ""He was a president our children could, and did, look up to. ... He was a great president.""

A good portion of what you wrote is either misleading or just full on untrue. There’s not a blanket ban on any website hosted in a foreign country, although it’s true that just the biggest ones are blocked without a VPN. However, VPN usage is fairly widespread throughout China, especially amongst younger folks. A sizable minority of people have and use VPNs to use foreign sites, so much so that Google, IG, even Pornhub (all blocked without VPN) all have features/communities catered to Mainland Chinese users. 

There has absolutely been muddying of the waters regarding the coronavirus narrative in China on state media, which is not good, but not to the degree you stated. State media reports domestically the same numbers reported to the outside world. You can doubt those numbers but even their official reported numbers say that there have been cases in every single region of China and thousands of deaths nationwide so it’s not like Chinese people have been told it’s just around Wuhan. Also state media reports the official reported numbers from overseas too so they’re not saying it’s millions of deaths in the West like you’re claiming. 

All this said, I definitely disagree with any racism and trying to push blame solely on foreigners that’s being done. There are plenty of legitimate things to criticize the Chinese gov for so no need for misinformation on your part."

>
> . . .
>
> It's literally free money. If you have a cash of at least $300 and a minimum of $300 in income for 2020 then you can donate it at zero cost. Plenty of people will be doing this.

That's not how tax deductions work. The $300 you're referencing is an [above-the-line deduction added by the coronavirus stimulus bill](https://www.doctorofcredit.com/stimulus-bill-adds-300-charitable-contribution-deduction-for-2020-beyond/). An above-the-line deduction is, like you said, a deduction you can claim without itemizing. However, it's not deducting from your taxes owed - [it's deducting from your declared income](https://money.usnews.com/money/personal-finance/taxes/articles/know-these-above-the-line-tax-deductions).

Let's look at this from a tax accountant's point of view. With a hypothetical single head-of-household who makes $50,000 and makes no deductions, they'd owe $3,521 federal income tax on $31,650 of taxable income.

If the same person donates $300 and claims the deduction, they'd owe $3,485 federal income tax on $31,350 of taxable income.

So by donating $300, you pay $36 less federal income tax, which means your ""cost"" for the donation was $264. 

If we look at it in terms of ""out of pocket cost"", and consider what's left over after paying the donation and income tax:

|                    | No Deduction | $300 deduction |
|--------------------|--------------|----------------|
| Income             | $50,000      | $50,000        |
| Taxable Income     | $31,650      | $31,350        |
| Federal Income Tax | $-3,521      | $-3,485        |
| Donation           |              | $-300          |
| Cash Left Over     | $46,488      | $46,215        |

The person who didn't donate has $264 more cash after tax. It's not free money, it's just a slightly less expensive charitable donation."

I’m not too confident that Trump is handling the coronavirus all that well. Sure, he’s doing some good things at the advice of the experts, but he seems far more concerned with continually attacking members of the press, trying to mitigate any damage of his ratings by deflecting blame on anyone he can, and occasionally going on rants about something entirely unrelated to the pandemic.

He also seems to desperately want to reopen the country ASAP, as if that was even possible. Looking at the data, the spread of the virus, and the history of worldwide pandemics, I don’t see how that’s even possible. We’re about 6 weeks in to the spread of the coronavirus in the United States. If we continue to isolate, and states like Florida actually get on board with the shut down, we’re probably looking at another 8-10 weeks before it would actually be safe enough to return to a sense of normalcy. Also, we would need massive widespread testing for that to occur.

If we open too soon, the pandemic is going to spread like wildfire. The rate of infection and death could be catastrophic if it wasn’t already bad enough.

I hope Trump has enough sense to realize that, but my honest belief is that he doesn’t have the attention span, nor resolve to keep the stay at home order in place for another 2 months.

If you look at the Spanish Flu pandemic, there was an initial spike that peaked in April and was gone by May. Many countries then resumed normal activity in late May. The summer appeared absolutely normal, but by August the Spanish Flu was spreading again, faster than before. As a result over 500 million people were infected and over 50 million died. By the time the Spanish Flu actually ended, 1 in every 3 people had been infected. This is why Trump receives a lot of criticism for doing nothing during the month of February when other countries like Italy were a clear warning sign of what was coming."

>London (CNN Business)The coronavirus pandemic is plunging the global economy into its deepest slump since the Great Depression of the 1930s and governments and health officials must work together to prevent an even worse outcome.

>That's the stark warning from the International Monetary Fund, which said on Tuesday there was a risk of the recession extending into 2021 if policymakers fail to coordinate a global response to the virus.

>In its latest outlook for the world economy, the IMF said it expects GDP will contract by 3% in 2020, a far worse recession than the one that followed the global financial crisis of 2008, and a 180-degree reversal of its previous forecast in January when it was expecting growth of 3.3% this year.

>""The Great Lockdown, as one might call it, is projected to shrink global growth dramatically. A partial recovery is projected for 2021 ... but the level of GDP will remain below the pre-virus trend, with considerable uncertainty about the strength of the rebound,"" the IMF said. ""Much worse growth outcomes are possible and maybe even likely,"" it added.

>In the United States, where lawmakers have approved over $2 trillion in stimulus and where the Federal Reserve has unleashed trillions more to keep the financial system from seizing up, the IMF expects the economy to shrink by 5.9% this year. That would be the worst slump since 1946, but a smaller decline in output than some European countries are likely to experience.

>Growth in China, the world's second-largest economy and the first to be slammed by the coronavirus, will meanwhile plummet to 1.2%. It hasn't seen growth that weak since 1976.

>The outlook is bleak even in countries where governments and central banks have responded forcefully in an effort to help workers and businesses. The IMF expects Germany's economy, the largest in Europe and heavily exposed to global trade, to contract by 7% in 2020. The Canadian economy is forecast to shrink by 6.2%, while the United Kingdom can expect a decline of 6.5%.

>Japan, the world's third largest economy, will contract by 5.3% even though it has so far avoided imposing harsh nationwide restrictions on travel, work and public life that have frozen economic activity in other parts of the world.

>EU countries have committed huge sums of money to supporting companies and households, and limits on budget deficits have been relaxed to allow them to borrow more. But Spain and Italy, which have been hit hard by the virus, are predicted to lose 8% and 9.1% of their economies respectively, underscoring the urgent need for the bloc to find a way of financing a recovery plan.

>The IMF forecast suggests the world is in the early stages of the most severe economic crisis in nearly a century, and that efforts to contain the pandemic will cost tens of millions of people their jobs and put tens of thousands of companies out of business. Unemployment in the United States will rise to 10.4% this year, according to the IMF, and 9.1% in 2021.

>The IMF expects the global economy to rebound in 2021, with growth hitting 5.8% if the pandemic fades in the second half of this year. But the group warns that its outlook is highly uncertain, and any number of factors could mean that efforts to contain the coronavirus remain in place for much longer than expected.

>""The pandemic could prove more persistent than assumed .... Moreover, the effects of the health crisis on economic activity and financial markets could turn out to be stronger and longer lasting, testing the limits of central banks to backstop the financial system and further raising the fiscal burden of the shock,"" the IMF warns in its report.

>Consumer confidence may fail to improve, for example. Companies and households may change their behavior, leading to weak demand and further disruption to supply chains. Reduced investment and bankruptcies could leave ""scars"" that ""may run more extensively through the economy,"" the IMF said.

>Global response needed

>The best way to ease the economic trauma is for governments and public health officials to increase their cooperation, according to the IMF.

>""Countries urgently need to work together to slow the spread of the virus and to develop a vaccine and therapies to counter the disease. Until such medical interventions become available, no country is safe from the pandemic,"" the group's report states.

>The IMF recommends that governments spend more on testing, rehiring retired medical professionals and purchasing equipment such as ventilators and personal protective equipment. Trade restrictions on medical products should be lifted.

>The group praised developed economies including Australia, France, Germany, Italy, Japan and the United States for their fiscal response to the crisis, while also crediting China, Indonesia and South Africa. But more may need to be done.

>""Fiscal measures will need to be scaled up if the stoppages to economic activity are persistent, or the pickup in activity as restrictions are lifted is too weak,"" the IMF said.

>Governments should also provide relief to workers. In places where paid sick and family leave are not standard, ""governments should consider funding them to allow unwell workers or their caregivers to stay home without fear of losing their jobs during the pandemic,"" the IMF said.

They are also selling some of the supplies to private companies, who then sell them to the states. One of the companies was created on March 23rd, and is already apparently the ""...largest global supply chain for Covid-19 supplies right now"".

The company, in an amazing coincidence, was created by a GOP fundraiser who abruptly quit being a fundraiser, “...because nobody was doing it. Because the president and the vice president were asking people to help.” (FEMA is specifically set up to handle supply distribution...) He also said he gets his supplies through personal relationships, but can't give any details. 

So... they profit by seizing the supplies and funneling them through other people.

(AP) — A federal judge on Tuesday blocked Arkansas’ order preventing the state’s only surgical abortion clinic from performing the procedure during the coronavirus pandemic.

The decision came as health officials announced that at least 1,498 people in the state have been infected with the coronavirus, an increase over the 1,410 reported a day earlier. Two more people died because of the virus, bringing the state’s death toll to 32.

U.S. District Judge Kristine Baker granted the temporary restraining order that Little Rock Family Planning requested against the state. Arkansas had ordered the facility to halt surgical abortions unless they’re needed to protect the life or health of the mother.

**“The limited record supports the ... allegation that enforcement of the (order) against LRFP will inflict serious physical, emotional, and psychological injuries on LRFP’s patients by forcing them to delay, or altogether forgo, access to abortion care,**” Baker wrote."

Businesses are closed, drive thru or delivery only for restaurants, occupancy and hour limits for establishments that are open still, and everyone has been told to stay home unless they are essential workers or getting essentials. This went into effect the beginning of March. Part of the protest is due to thinking the stay at home order isn't necessary and part of it is out of fear of the damage it is doing to small businesses. I personally, think the protests are ridiculous and fully support the measures our governor has taken to reduce the spread.

> **Background:** Treatments are urgently needed to prevent respiratory failure and deaths from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) has received worldwide attention because of positive results from small studies. 

> **Methods:** We used data collected from routine care of all adults in 4 French hospitals with documented SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia and requiring oxygen ≥ 2 L/min to emulate a target trial aimed at assessing the effectiveness of HCQ at 600 mg/day. The composite primary endpoint was transfer to intensive care unit (ICU) within 7 days from inclusion and/or death from any cause. Analyses were adjusted for confounding factors by inverse probability of treatment weighting. 

> **Results:** This study included 181 patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia; 84 received HCQ within 48 hours of admission (HCQ group) and 97 did not (no-HCQ group). Initial severity was well balanced between the groups. In the weighted analysis, 20.2% patients in the HCQ group were transferred to the ICU or died within 7 days vs 22.1% in the no-HCQ group (16 vs 21 events, relative risk [RR] 0.91, 95% CI 0.47-1.80). In the HCQ group, 2.8% of the patients died within 7 days vs 4.6% in the no-HCQ group (3 vs 4 events, RR 0.61, 95% CI 0.13-2.89), and 27.4% and 24.1%, respectively, developed acute respiratory distress syndrome within 7 days (24 vs 23 events, RR 1.14, 95% CI 0.65-2.00). Eight patients receiving HCQ (9.5%) experienced electrocardiogram modifications requiring HCQ discontinuation. 

> **Interpretation:** These results do not support the use of HCQ in patients hospitalised for documented SARS-CoV-2-positive hypoxic pneumonia."

But I don’t think that part of the retail buyers are the majority now, most of them have been flushed out during the 2017-2020 bear market. We’ve already capitulated twice down to 3k/4k, and the jump has been strong. The people buying now are the ones who have extra cash to do so. Remember only 1% own bitcoin in this world, I highly doubt the majority who are holding now are people who desperately need cash. 

Those people have sold in the last few weeks. Also we’re starting to see death toll drop in Italy.

But that also means we shouldn’t expect too many buyers. Seems like a the perfect condition for a very long sideways movement, as the economy also need time to recover.

Also another thing to consider - bitcoin was born out of a financial crisis back in 2008 - Satoshi fundamentally didn’t trust the central bank. That narrative could reignite twelve years later when it’s seemingly more relevant.

Like think of it like this... The whole world decided to basically go on *pause* for this thing because we all (or at least a significant percent, even a small percent) felt it necessary to do such. THIS HAS NEVER HAPPENED FOR ANYTHING BEFORE

This has not happened for 9/11, climate change, poverty, diabetes, inequality in all its forms, cancer, hiv, hunger, endangered species, ai, pollution, drugs, addiction, war, school shootings, ebola, spanish flu, etc etc. I'm not a child of history but I'm pretty sure even during fuking the world wars people were still going to school and to work. Idk but that's not the point I'm trying to make. Just insert anything that you consider a ""problem"" with the world and notice how many would consider it a ""global"" issue and yet nothing happened for it or progress is unseen, unheard, or slow.

What does that tell you?

If you get what I'm saying it tells you many things, but it tells me this... We don't seriously care about anything we supposedly do. We don't act. We don't think for ourselves. We basically do whatever the media and other powers that be say. We don't value anything. We don't know why we agree to the world that exists at present. All the excuses we make, not enough time, not enough money, not enough support, etc are all horseshit. Kids are not going to school! 9/11 the next day I went back to class! But coronavirus... Stop everything! 

At a near overnight pace the status quo and daily movement changed completely. Yet we won't do this for our ""real"" problems? That's fucking sick! That's pathetic! That's a fucking joke!

If there's anything to be learned from this... It's that the world (us collectively) are not right in the head. Whether you put this on some conspiracy or not the fact that we let this crap happen is the main point. WE chose all the suffering that has happened in this world. And if there is ANYTHING to be learned is that we can choose a world where we ALL can live happily and freely.

So when things go back, personally I don't want anyone to except nothing less than immediate change. No excuses because there absolutely are none. If the world overnight can be changed for coronavirus, it can, and SHOULD, and MUST change for the things that are truly important or anything that promotes human health, wealth, and happiness"

April 13 2020, The Times

Britain will remain in lockdown for another three weeks as the cabinet debates whether to encourage some people to return to work.
Dominic Raab, who is deputising for Boris Johnson, will announce on Thursday that the lockdown will stay in place until at least May 7.

He is expected to ask Nicola Sturgeon, Scotland’s first minister, and the other leaders of the devolved administrations to attend a Cobra meeting to ensure a UK-wide approach in setting the deadline, the maximum allowed under emergency legislation that mandates reviews every three weeks.

Senior ministers are split, however, on whether to encourage people to return to the workplace if it is safe to do so and if they cannot work from home, as evidence of the economic, social and health costs of the lockdown mounts.

Participation at work is lower than expected when the lockdown was designed, adding billions of pounds to the cost of the furlough scheme and other mitigation measures, and risking deeper damage to the economy.
Matt Hancock, the health secretary, does not want to risk undermining the “stay at home” message and has the backing of some in Downing Street who believe that efforts to encourage people to work are futile given public opinion.

Nearly three quarters of people in the UK, 74 per cent, prioritise limiting the spread of the infection even if it means extra costs to the economy, compared with 61 per cent in the United States and 54 per cent in Germany and Sweden. Thirteen per cent in the UK want to protect the economy even if it means allowing the virus to spread, half the proportion in Germany, according to polling by Kekst CNC.

Experts advising the government will meet today and on Thursday to assess the latest data but Mr Raab made clear that there was no immediate prospect of relaxing the lockdown. “We don’t expect to make any changes to the measures currently in place at that point,” he said. “We have come too far, lost too many loved ones and sacrificed too much to ease up.”

Also at the government’s daily press conference Sir Patrick Vallance, the chief scientific adviser, braced the UK for a “difficult” week in which another rise in the daily number of deaths is expected. He said evidence from other countries suggested that the number of deaths would plateau “for two or three weeks” before starting to fall.

Although the lockdown is helping to shrink infection rates, he said, a rise in the numbers is being driven by “cases in care homes and in hospitals where infections are being picked up”.

Chris Whitty, the chief medical officer for England, said that 92 care homes had reported coronavirus infections in the past 24 hours, taking the total proportion of care homes to have declared Covid-19 cases to 13.5 per cent.

It also emerged that the government was reviewing whether to change its advice and recommend that people wear facemasks to help slow the spread of the coronavirus. “We look at this and update our view from time to time,” Sir Patrick said. “We’re actually looking at it again now. The evidence on masks is much more persuasive for masks stopping you giving it to somebody than it is for preventing you catching it.”
He added that if there were “evidence that looks like we should change our advice, we would do so”.

Ministers are under pressure over shortages of PPE, particularly gowns. Distribution problems and rapidly depleting stockpiles have become one of the most urgent worries.
A three-week extension will give Mr Johnson more time to recover and to shape the decision, ministers said, and in any case public opinion is firmly against relaxation for now. “You could open every sports stadium in the country but I’m not sure you’d get many takers,” one senior minister said.
Mr Johnson will also want to involve the leaders of the devolved administrations and mayors including Sadiq Khan and Andy Burnham in the way forward.
He will return to Downing Street to find himself refereeing a cabinet that is split over whether to press people to return to work.
The prime minister discussed the crisis with Mr Raab on Saturday but has promised his medical team that he will not return to Downing Street immediately.
He is in daily discussion with clinicians and there is no set time for his recovery. His spokesman said yesterday that Mr Johnson was “not carrying out any government work”.
He will not play any part in a review of the lockdown, which is widely expected to keep the restrictions in place, a government source said. That leaves Mr Raab, the foreign secretary, in charge of overseeing the review, which will be formally conducted by Matt Hancock, the health secretary, as part of the emergency legislation passed to deal with the crisis.

With no cabinet today, the decision to extend will be rubber-stamped by the so-called war cabinet on Thursday. In addition to Mr Raab and Mr Hancock, this includes Rishi Sunak, the chancellor, and Michael Gove, the Cabinet Office minister.
Senior sources acknowledge that Mr Johnson will return to an unresolved debate about how far to press people to return to work where they can safely do so. Ministers say that it is too simplistic to divide them into “hawks” and “doves” on the complex decisions and trade-offs over easing the lockdown as deaths from the virus fall, probably later this month. It fails to account for their duty to represent the interests of their departments and presents as binary choices that are anything but, they say.

Nevertheless, cabinet ministers acknowledge that there are varying degrees of appetite for the immediate risk posed by the virus and the longer-term but potentially worse risk posed by closing down large sections of the economy and society into the late summer and autumn.

“The original message was to carry on working but do so if you could from home. We need to find a way at the right time to get back to that message,” one “hawk” said.
Ministers on the “dove” side of the debate say that the government must wait for public opinion to turn before encouraging people back to work. Those most involved in the economy — Mr Sunak, Robert Jenrick, the communities secretary, and Alok Sharma, the business secretary — are unsurprisingly the most likely to raise concerns about the costs of the lockdown, as red lights start to flash on their departmental dashboards.

Local government finance is becoming a serious worry as the number of people defaulting on their council tax soars. The number of commercial tenants in rent arrears could hit 80 per cent by June, according to one internal estimate.

The Treasury warns of “systemic failures” if the economy is not brought out of its coma by mid-summer. “There’s a point where there just isn’t anything to come back to,” one well-placed source said. “You’ve got to give businesses some idea that they will be trading by mid-summer.”

Even those in economic ministries acknowledge the constraints. “The worst thing would be to relax too soon and to have to shut down again this autumn,” one said.
Work is nevertheless continuing across departments on options for the first relaxations. The list of shops allowed to open could be expanded either by changing the definition of what is deemed essential or, more likely, to include retail outlets most able to enforce social distancing of customers.
Moves to restart construction and manufacturing are also being considered, although both face supply chain challenges in addition to those posed by keeping their workforces safe — and questions over whether public transport can cope with social distancing rules as commuters start to return.
While reopening schools has been suggested for inclusion in the “first steps” of releasing the lockdown, the move is by no means certain — not least because it is far from clear that parents would be willing to allow their children to attend given the difficulties of keeping pupils apart, particularly those in primary schools.
“Some of this takes the judgment of Solomon,” one minister admitted.
Another said: “It’s an awful lot easier to shut everything down than to restart it. We’re not just going to flick a switch and it’s all as it was.”

>The CIA advised employees that taking an anti-malarial drug that has been touted by President Trump

>and others as a potential treatment for coronavirus could have potentially dangerous side effects, including death, The Washington Post reported.

>The warning was reportedly published on a website for CIA staff with questions related to the coronavirus pandemic late last month. 

>“At this point, the drug is not recommended to be used by patients except by medical professionals prescribing it as part of ongoing investigational studies. There are potentially significant side effects, including sudden cardiac death, associated with hydroxychloroquine and its individual use in patients need to be carefully selected and monitored by a health care professional,” read a response to an employee who asked whether they should take the drug without a prescription, according to the Post.

>“Please do not obtain this medication on your own,” was reportedly added in bold type.

>The website also said there had been media reports saying the drug “has activity against the COVID-19 virus,” the newspaper noted. 

>Trump has called the drug a “game changer” and told reporters that it is “looking like it’s having some good results.”

>“Just recently, a friend of mine told me he got better from the use of that drug, so who knows?"" the president said on Monday

>“I think if anybody recommended it other than me, it would be used all over the place,” he added.

>But Trump also said earlier this month that those interested in the drug “have to go through your medical people, get the approval.”

>Hydroxychloroquine has been widely used to treat malaria, in addition to lupus and rheumatoid arthritis.

>Among some preliminary studies examining the drug’s effect on coronavirus, one potentially showed promise, but the result was later questioned by the publisher of the study, the Post noted. A small study in Brazil of chloroquine, a similar drug, was halted because multiple test subjects taking high doses developed irregular heat rates.

>Earlier this month, Anthony Fauci

>, a leading member of Trump's coronavirus task force, said that it is too soon to determine how effective the drug is against COVID-19.

>""The data are really just at best suggestive. There have been cases that show there may be an effect, and there are others to show there's no effect,"" he said on CBS's ""Face the Nation.”

But not how the article in the OP puts it.  The exact opposite in fact.  When our clinics got the first confirmed case of COVID-19, we submitted the information to our local public health department.  But the next day our public health department reported no cases of COVID-19 in our community.  Next day, same thing, no cases.  Even though we had a case isolated in our clinic.  Eventually word of mouth started spreading that we had a guy tested positive with 19 in isolation and finally the public health people revealed we have one confirmed case.

Even these days, where we have cases popping up each day, which get reported to public health, they've been hesitant to update their numbers until days, or sometimes even weeks after we get confirmation.  And while our office manages several clinics in our state, we are just a tiny fraction of all the health care clinics in our state.  And if our cases are being censored, I can only imagine all other clinics are being censored.

We all know China is just throwing out BS numbers at this point, but part of me is thinking we're throwing out BS numbers over here as well."

2020-04-14,ManchurianCandidate7,Wuhan_Flu,18,https://www.reddit.com/r/Wuhan_Flu/comments/g15tss/wapo_2_years_before_coronavirus_pandemic_the_us/fndkt3n/,"Sources familiar with the cables said they were meant to sound an alarm about the grave safety concerns at the WIV lab, especially regarding its work with bat coronaviruses. The embassy officials were calling for more U.S. attention to this lab and more support for it, to help it fix its problems.

“The cable was a warning shot,” one U.S. official said. “They were begging people to pay attention to what was going on.”
No extra assistance to the labs was provided by the U.S. government in response to these cables. The cables began to circulate again inside the administration over the past two months as officials debated whether the lab could be the origin of the pandemic and what the implications would be for the U.S. pandemic response and relations with China.

Inside the Trump administration, many national security officials have long suspected either the WIV or the Wuhan Center for Disease Control and Prevention lab was the source of the novel coronavirus outbreak. According to the New York Times, the intelligence community has provided no evidence to confirm this. But one senior administration official told me that the cables provide one more piece of evidence to support the possibility that the pandemic is the result of a lab accident in Wuhan.

“The idea that is was just a totally natural occurrence is circumstantial. The evidence it leaked from the lab is circumstantial. Right now, the ledger on the side of it leaking from the lab is packed with bullet points and there’s almost nothing on the other side,” the official said.

As my colleague David Ignatius noted, the Chinese government’s original story — that the virus emerged from a seafood market in Wuhan — is shaky. Research by Chinese experts published in the Lancet30183-5/fulltext#bib35) in January showed the first known patient, identified on Dec. 1, had no connection to the market, nor did more than one-third of the cases in the first large cluster. Also, the market didn’t sell bats.

Shi and other WIV researchers have categorically denied this lab was the origin for the novel coronavirus. On Feb. 3, her team was the first to publicly report the virus known as 2019-nCoV was a bat-derived coronavirus.

The Chinese government, meanwhile, has put a total lockdown on information related to the virus origins. Beijing has yet to provide U.S. experts with samples of the novel coronavirus collected from the earliest cases. The Shanghai lab that published the novel coronavirus genome on Jan. 11 was quickly shut down by authorities for “rectification.” Several of the doctors and journalists who reported on the spread early on have disappeared.

On Feb. 14, Chinese President Xi Jinping called for a new biosecurity law to be accelerated. On Wednesday, CNN reported the Chinese government has placed severe restrictions requiring approval before any research institution publishes anything on the origin of the novel coronavirus.

The origin story is not just about blame. It’s crucial to understanding how the novel coronavirus pandemic started because that informs how to prevent the next one. The Chinese government must be transparent and answer the questions about the Wuhan labs because they are vital to our scientific understanding of the virus, said Xiao.
We don’t know whether the novel coronavirus originated in the Wuhan lab, but the cable pointed to the danger there and increases the impetus to find out, he said.

“I don’t think it’s a conspiracy theory. I think it’s a legitimate question that needs to be investigated and answered,” he said. “To understand exactly how this originated is critical knowledge for preventing this from happening in the future.”

April 14, 2020 — 10.30pm

Australia will endure its largest economic hit since the onset of the Great Depression, the International Monetary Fund has warned, with unemployment to remain high for at least two more years in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic.

Releasing forecasts for the global economy overnight, the IMF predicts the Australian economy will contract by 6.7 per cent this year, or almost $130 billion. It would be the single largest hit since 1930 when the economy is estimated to have contracted by 9.5 per cent as the Great Depression set in.

Of the world's 20 largest economies, Australia's performance is forecast to be among the bottom third with countries such as the United States (minus 5.9 per cent), Britain (minus 6.5 per cent) and South Korea (minus 1.2 per cent) all tipped to do better.

The huge hit to the economy will reverberate through the jobs market. Unemployment is expected to average 7.6 per cent this year before increasing to 8.9 per cent through 2021.

That would leave Australia with a jobless rate around the average of continental Europe and well above comparable nations such as New Zealand (6.8 per cent), Britain (4.4 per cent) and Canada (7.2 per cent).

IMF chief economist Gita Gopinath said the global economy was likely to contract by 3 per cent this year after growing by 2.9 per cent through 2019.

She said the slowdown was like no other on record, as economies were being closed to prevent the spread of the coronavirus.

""It is very likely that this year the global economy will experience its worst recession since the Great Depression, surpassing that seen during the global financial crisis a decade ago,"" she said.

""The Great Lockdown, as one might call it, is projected to shrink global growth dramatically.""

The fund marked out Australia and a handful of nations for their ""swift and sizeable"" fiscal responses to the pandemic, but cautioned even more money may be needed if the virus continues.

""Fiscal measures will need to be scaled up if the stoppages to economic activity are persistent, or the pick-up in activity as restrictions are lifted is too weak,"" she said.

Modelling for the federal Treasury has found Australia's unemployment rate is likely to peak at 10 per cent in the June quarter. It is currently 5.1 per cent.

Treasurer Josh Frydenberg would not be drawn on how long it would take for unemployment to fall from its peak, but said on Tuesday the government would focus on ways to re-energise the economy to boost the jobs market.

""I believe that more jobs will be created on the other side of this crisis. I think there will be the recovery phase, Australia will be well positioned for that,"" he said.

""But there are certainly some challenges ahead.""

One of those challenges was highlighted in NAB's monthly business survey, which found a total collapse in confidence and trading conditions across the nation through March.

It also found a sharp fall in cashflow with businesses dramatically scaling back their capital expenditure plans.

Opposition leader Anthony Albanese said the government would have to reconsider its plans to end the $550 JobSeeker supplement, which is due to end in mid-September.

He said the government had conceded through the JobSeeker supplement that the old Newstart allowance, at $40 a day, was not enough to live on.

""It’s clear to me that the idea that you would just return back to $40 and do it in a way which the prime minister implies with snap back, you do it instantly, would provide a massive shock to the economy,"" he said."

If people are calling for science to be respected than there needs to be acknowledgement of the specific science literature that exists on this virus.

You seem to recognize this, but you characterize the food being thrown away as ""excess"" rather than a vital subsection of the nation's food supply. 

I don't understand how you see decreased demand at your restaurant job as an indication that people are just eating less. In the United States fast food makes up a huge portion of people's daily nutrition, up to 50%, and you think that those people aren't looking for food elsewhere? Those people still have to eat, and they're going to drive up demand at grocery stores as shortages decimate the supply, jacking up prices. Depending on how badly supply lines are interrupted, this could be a serious development - think bread lines and riots."

I might think it was the virus however I was at my parents house at the time, who are both mid 70s, they also had their flu vaccines, but neither of them got even a sniffle while I was ill. Which tells me it was just the flu."

The female speaker does have an infectious disease background, but she admitted at around time marker 3:10 that she was new to the region. Also listening to the speakers, there's a hint of arrogance that Singapore was prepared to handle the virus and they could just go about their daily business. They talked about their contact tracing and quarantine procedures, but apparently they didn't apply that to westerners, which pretty much put all their efforts to waste fast forwarding to April.

Both speakers were from this school:

Even Fox doesn’t believe their own bullshit.

>	Hannity contrasted the novel coronavirus fatality numbers with those of the seasonal flu, despite knowing that the novel virus’ mortality rate is significantly higher. Hannity knew it was a misleading comparison because the night before on his program Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, told him that the coronavirus is at least 10-times more lethal than influenza.
Meanwhile, throughout all of Fox News’ coverage, Fox Corporation, the parent company of the network, has taken the matter seriously. The company has restricted all non-essential travel. And, in a Thursday email obtained by CNN Business, Fox News Media CEO Suzanne Scott and President and Executive Editor Jay Wallace announced several sweeping measures to protect employees, including asking staff able to work from home to do so starting Monday.

Even if a country didn't experience high rate of cases, the country will be under economic pressure and may collapse due to external pressure.

Algeria derives 90% of GDP from oil. The break even point is $100 per barrel of oil. Spot price of oil is far below break even.

Argentina with a limited number of cases is on the verge of missing debt payments shortly, perhaps weeks or just a couple of months away.

Bahamas derives a significant portion of GDP from tourism. No planes or cruise ships are sailing. 

GDP composite, balance of trade issues, is the country a net import or exporter, financial issues may cause a number of countries to be under economic pressure. The IMF in the last report I read indicated 170 countries around the world will experience contracting GDP this year. There isn't enough money to bailout everything and all smaller countries. Calls by leaders to have a jubilee, debt forgiveness or delay of debt payments, ignore the domino effect where individuals and entities that hold debt globally expecting payment stream then realize a short fall.

This means that individuals could see their payments transferred from their hands into the hands of their creditors, potentially leaving them with nothing.

Banks would be first in line to grab the payments to offset a delinquent loan or past-due fees. Even if the individual thinks their account with that bank is closed, if the payments post there, the bank could conceivably use them to cover old debts.

The Treasury Department effectively blessed this activity on a webinar with banking officials last Friday. In audio obtained by the Prospect, Ronda Kent, chief disbursing officer with Treasury’s Bureau of the Fiscal Service, can be heard explaining that banks had posed questions to her about “whether these payments could be subject to collection from the bank to which the money is deposited, if the payee owes an outstanding loan or other payments to the bank.” She responded—twice—that “there’s nothing in the law that precludes that action""

>B.C.'s provincial health officer says that mass testing continues to be an ineffective strategy to slow transmission of COVID-19 because it has a false negative rate as high as 30 per cent.

>At her daily briefing on Monday, Dr. Bonnie Henry said testing is not as sensitive as health officials expected it to be earlier in the crisis.

>""The testing, unfortunately, doesn't tell us the whole story. People can be negative one minute and positive within an hour.""

>Testing in B.C. is currently being limited to those who develop coronavirus symptoms who are hospitalized, residents or staff of long-term care facilities, part of an outbreak investigation, or health-care workers.

>""The norm is not to test people who do not have symptoms because we know the test doesn't perform very well and we can have false negatives,"" Henry said.

>However, Henry did say that there is a low threshold for testing anybody with symptoms in a care home to try to get ahead of outbreaks.

>While a false negative rate of 30 per cent can raise concerns about the reliability of COVID-19 testing in Canada, microbiologist Craig Jenne says that's the worst-case scenario.

>""You're probably talking [about] a 30 per cent failure rate with a non co-operative patient, and somebody who has never done a nasal swab before, and the sample then ended up in somebody's car being transported to a lab for three days before it got processed,"" he said. 

>According to Jenne, associate professor in the department of microbiology, immunology and infectious diseases at the University of Calgary, the reality is that labs won't accept anything with a false negative rate greater than five per cent.

>He says there are several reasons testing can be unreliable. For example, someone in the early stages of infection may not have enough viral replication in their body to be detected yet.

>In other cases, a throat swab may not reach the virus.

>Testing, he says, is most useful to give health officials a snapshot of how far into the community the virus has spread.

>""We can't guarantee that the test is going to catch 100 per cent of the infected people so we're using it really as a confirmation of people with symptoms,"" Jenne said.

>Jenne says people in the early stages of infection can, unfortunately, still transmit the virus, even if they test negative and don't have symptoms.

>He says proposals for widespread testing to allow people to return to work don't take into account the fact that tests are time sensitive. 

>""Somebody could for example test negative today, be exposed at lunch, and then be infected by tomorrow.""

>Both Jenne and Henry maintain that without physical distancing measures, testing is an ineffective way of slowing the spread of the coronavirus.

>""We're still seeing viral spread even in the absence of testing,"" said Jenne. ""So I don't know how large levels of testing is going to get us back to a normal life any quicker because everyone's still having to follow the same infection.""

>Henry says the strategy in B.C. prioritizes prevention, whether its by assessing health-care workers for symptoms on a daily basis, wearing protective equipment, or general physical distancing.

With the coronavirus its causing lots of Anti China and then Anti Asian sentiment, because a lot of non asians have a tough time telling other asians apart. 
Theres other reasons to such as:  
 -Highlighting the irony of countries like the USA even though they are objectively handling the pandemic really badly and their economy is crashing while China is doing a lot better.  
- Addressing the issue of why saying that you are so and so Asian and not Chinese is ineffective in combating the rising Anti Asian discrimination  
- The recent postings on the media on how blacks are being discriminated in China, and the resulting Anti Asian backlash by some ignorant people. We need to sort out and address what's true or not  
- Highlighting how Western countries wrongfully treat Chinese Americans with a history of serving the country and portraying them as Chinese spies  

Basically, those are some of the reasons you see lots of posts on China on this sub, we are trying to fight the Anti Asian tide that's coming along with it and analyzing the news we are being fed in the West and figuring out what's true or not"

> **JAMES COOPER SAYS: UNITED LIKE SANCHO**

> Manchester United like Jadon Sancho very much and he fits the bill too when it comes to being young, English, exciting and fundamentally someone who could strengthen and fill a position that needs to be properly filled. If you think about the prospect of Rashford, Martial and Sancho as a front three with Bruno Fernandes providing the passes and vision behind them, it starts to look a bit more exciting and you can understand why someone like Sancho answers so many questions. 

> The transfer fee and salary wouldn't be a problem for Manchester United and when you throw in his friendship with Marcus Rashford it appears to be a deal that has all the ingredients to happen. Before anyone gets carried away, though, one note of caution is we don't know how this next transfer window will look or how clubs will behave. However, before coronavirus struck Jadon Sancho would have been top of Manchester United's target list

**Q** - Should Daniel James go on a season-long loan?

> **JAMES COOPER SAYS: NO NEED** 

> I think with Daniel James, his development as a player will be the foremost consideration in what Ole Gunnar Solskjaer decides to do with him next season but I really don't think there's a need to loan him out for him to progress. We all saw the signs of raw talent at the start of the season when arguably he was the only thing for Manchester United fans to get excited about on the back of 3 goals in his first 4 games for the club. 

> He was never envisaged as being a first team regular in only his second season as a professional and I bet right now Daniel James is really getting the benefit of this extended mid-season break as he looked worn out before football was paused. As a player and a person the Welshman's had a lot to contend with this season but imagine how much he could learn from someone like Jadon Sancho!

**Q** - Is there any chance of Kai Havertz and/or Timo Werner moving to Manchester United?

> **JAMES COOPER SAYS: THEY'RE ON THE RADAR**

> They're players that are certainly on the Manchester United radar, their performances and profile mean they've been looked at but right now I get the impression that the focus may well be on other positions and other players. That doesn't mean that either couldn't fit into life at Old Trafford but if Jadon Sancho is a primary target then I couldn't see a scenario whereby Timo Werner arrived too. 

> Equally I think midfield options look strong, thanks in part to the renaissance of Nemanja Matic and Fred's development, throw Bruno Fernandes and perhaps even Paul Pogba into the equation and at the moment I couldn't see where Kai Havertz would fit. 

> Manchester United have shown signs of improving their recruitment and part of that process is narrowing down options so what I'm suggesting is that if #1 targets don't materialise then other options come into play. I don't think anyone at Old Trafford envisaged signing Odion Ighalo for much of January.........

**Q** - Is Angel Gomes going to sign a new contract?

> **JAMES COOPER SAYS: POSITIVE SIGNS**

> The signs are positive, especially when you consider six of his academy peers have signed new deals in the past 13 months, the most recent of those being Tahith Chong. I've watched him play plenty of times for Manchester United's U23s where Angel Gomes has dominated matches and I know that when he's got his first-team chances he may not have been in his favoured position, but you have to say those performances have been solid rather than spectacular. 

> He's still very young, at just 19, but will hopefully recognise staying will aid his development as a player more than leaving. If he does decide to sign the contract Manchester United are offering him, the next decision will be whether Gomes and also Chong would benefit from being loaned out next season and playing regularly.

**The last Q** - What position should Man Utd realistically be aiming to finish next season? 

> **JAMES COOPER SAYS :**

> It's a really good question and one I'll try not to fudge but it does depend on continued successful recruitment and, as this season has proved at some stages, keeping key players fit and playing. Manchester United's current run means they're knocking on the door when it comes to the top four and they could still qualify for the Champions League by winning the Europa League and then of course there's the prospect of another trophy in the FA Cup. 

> Ole Gunnar Solskjaer will demand progress from his players, as he experienced under Sir Alex Ferguson, and while I can't quite see a title challenge next season I'd expect them to be comfortably within the top four and if they've managed to gain Champions League qualification that will only benefit the development of the squad further. Manchester United fans have learnt to be patient since that last Premier League triumph of 2013 but after plenty of false-starts it seems something more sustained is emerging."

>Chris Cuomo’s coronavirus-induced fever may have subsided but the CNN anchor was red hot on Monday.
The longtime cable host, 49, had an existential mini-crisis on his SiriusXM show, lashing out at his lucrative primetime gig and blasting
President Trump as “full of s–t.”
“I don’t want to spend my time doing things that I don’t think are valuable enough to me personally,” Cuomo said. “I don’t value indulging
irrationality, hyper-partisanship.”
Cuomo said his battle with COVID-19 has made him rethink his values and question his position as a public �gure.
“I don’t like what I do professionally,” he said. “I don’t think it’s worth my time.”
Cuomo then launched into a tale about a “loser biker” who confronted him on Easter Sunday for being outside his Southampton home with
his family despite his coronavirus diagnosis.
“I don’t want some jackass, loser, fat tire biker being able to pull over and get in my space and
talk bulls–t to me, I don’t want to hear it,” he said.
Cuomo said he wishes he could have acted like a regular Joe and told the biker to “go to
hell.”
“That matters to me more than making millions of dollars a year … because I’ve saved my
money and I don’t need it anymore,” he said.
“I want to be able to tell you to go to hell, to shut your mouth … I don’t get that doing what I do
for a living.
“Me being able to tell you to shut your mouth or I will do you the way you guys do each other.”
Speaking about his job as the host of CNN’s “Cuomo Prime Time,” the Queens-born anchor said he doesn’t want to spend his time
“tra�cking in things that I think are ridiculous.”
Such things include “talking to Democrats about things that I don’t really believe they mean” and “talking to Republicans about them
parroting things they feel they have to say.”
He also wants to stop analyzing the president, “who we all know is full of s–t by design.”
As a public �gure, Cuomo said, he has to tolerate other people’s opinions of him — and it’s just not worth it to him anymore.
“I don’t think it’s worth it to me because I don’t think I mean enough, I don’t think I matter enough, I don’t think I can really change anything,
so then what am I really doing?”
“I’m basically being perceived as successful in a system that I don’t value,” he continued. “I’m seen as being good at being on TV and
advocating for di�erent positions … but I don’t know if I value those things, certainly not as much as I value being able to live my life on my
own terms.”
When the biker confronted him, Cuomo said, he’d wanted to respond, getting heated when he detailed
how the guy “didn’t know the rules” and how he’d made sure to take social-distancing measures.
But “here I am in an almost powerless position against this ass—- because I’m a celebrity and he’s
allowed to say whatever he wants to me.”
“And I have to take it or he’s gonna call the New York Post and lie about something and then I’m going
to have to deal with it,” Cuomo continued.
The anchor then alluded to a caught-on-tape incident last August, when he launched into a profanitylaced rant against a man who called him “Fredo.”
“I have to tolerate people’s opinion about me because I’m a public �gure,” Cuomo said. “I don’t want to
do that, I don’t think it’s worth it to me.”"

Shalom Center Director Forrest Gilmore called the emergency funds from the state Family and Social Services Administration ""a blessing.""

Starting Tuesday night, the 60 rooms at the Travelodge at 2615 E. Third St. will be open to people experiencing homelessness who may have the coronavirus that is spreading across the nation.

""This is definitely a major advance that we are really excited about,"" the Rev. Gilmore said. ""We were kind of pulling strings to try and make an isolation site happen, and now we have this option, which actually is getting us into best practices and a better ability to care for people in the way it needs to be done."" 

With the motel open to quarantine people who may be sick, the current homeless isolation shelter established in the 300 block of Hillside Drive with help from donations and a $70,000 United Way grant is being used for overnight housing.

Men and women who once stayed at Friends Place on Rogers Street, which sleeps 40 people in close quarters, have been relocated.

Friends House closed temporarily last week, Gilmore said, and people who had stayed there transferred to the warehouse business building on Hillside Drive that was the county's initial isolation site.

Shalom staff member Sean Buehler was talking with state officials nearly two weeks ago about protocols for the isolation shelter when he learned the state would be awarding grants to fund regional isolation centers for people without homes.

Gilmore and Emily Pike, who oversees New Hope's family shelter, submitted a plan to the state for a regional center a week ago, and learned on Friday it had been approved. 

""Now, it's just a matter of them getting final paperwork to us, and that is in process right now,"" Gilmore said Monday afternoon. ""We put it out for an informal bidding process and we found a couple of motels that expressed interest.""

One hurdle was cleared, he said, when the city of Bloomington agreed to act as the fiscal agent to receive and administer the funds.

""This grant from the FSSA has changed everything,"" Gilmore said. ""It's been a busy week and a half trying to work our way through this new blessing.""

He and others still are seeking a waiver from the state to continue operating the warehouse shelter site beyond 30 days because it doesn't have a required occupancy permit."
