KUALA LUMPUR - The growing number of cases of influenza A has seen several schools in Penang and the Klang Valley closing, with stocks of flu shots running low.

At least 53 people have been infected in Penang and 23 in Selangor as of Friday (Jan 10) morning, and some hospitals have turned away patients, with the authorities advising bed rest at home.

Of the cases in Selangor, reported in Cyberjaya and Klang, only two were hospitalised.

  

""They need good rest. They will recover. If we admit everyone at public hospitals, others may be infected, too,"" Deputy Health Minister Lee Boon Chye was reported as saying by news portal Free Malaysia Today (FMT).

However, he said there is enough influenza medicine in public healthcare centres, while some private hospitals need to replenish their stocks after a surge in flu cases following [an outbreak in China last month](https://www.straitstimes.com/asia/east-asia/wuhan-flu-caused-by-new-coronavirus-more-about-the-pathogen-behind-the-outbreak).

The Education Ministry has also advised parents not to let their sick children go to school but to seek professional medical attention.

FMT also reported that several private hospitals in the Klang Valley had run out of beds after seeing a surge in influenza cases, and were focusing on outpatient treatment, except in cases when symptoms become more severe.

 

Penang's education department has said it will take proactive measures to control the spread of cases there, including the distribution of face masks in schools.

Malaysia's director-general of health Noor Hisham Abdullah said last week that tests showed the influenza viruses were not mutations or new strains, and that the number of cases was still in the ""normal range""."

> SINGAPORE — A 26-year-old male Chinese national has been admitted for further assessment and treatment as part of precautions in light of a pneumonia outbreak in China, said the Ministry of Health (MOH) on Friday (10 January).

> The ministry said that it was notified of the case of pneumonia as of 10am.

> The man, who had travelled to Wuhan, has been isolated as a precautionary measure and remains in stable condition, it added.

> “The suspect case has not visited the Huanan seafood wholesale market associated with the cluster of pneumonia in Wuhan,” the MOH said.

> Investigations to establish whether the case is linked to the outbreak are ongoing.

> Last Sunday, a three-year-old female Chinese national with pneumonia, who had also travelled to Wuhan, was similarly isolated as a precautionary measure.

> She later tested negative for the virus and was instead diagnosed with Respiratory Syncytial Virus, a common cause of childhood respiratory infection.

> Experts in China had ""preliminarily determined"" that a new type of coronavirus – belonging to the same family as Sudden Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) – was behind the outbreak that has struck 59 people in the country with no death reported.

> The World Health Organization (WHO) confirmed the preliminary discovery of a new coronavirus in a statement.

> ""Further investigations are also required to determine the source, modes of transmission, extent of infection and countermeasures implemented,"" said WHO Representative to China Gauden Galea.

> No obvious evidence of human-to-human transmission has been reported so far.

> News of the virus’ spread has seen countries such as Singapore, Malaysia and Vietnam conducting temperature screenings on passengers arriving from Wuhan.

Just like SARS and MERS.  Can say from a scientific perspective that (1) they didn’t usually transmit between humans easily and are usually the result of repeated infections from animals and (2) there are antiviral drugs being treated in humans against at least MERS that are known to have broad activity against multiple coronaviruses."

I live in the city where the outbreak happens (the place where they find patient zero is actually no more than 5 kilometer from where I live). The government took action quickly and kept people updated about the epidemic, so there is concerns from the public but barely any panic, comparing to the SARS outbreak. The disease is not as severe as SARS and MERS, though the virus is confirmed to be coronavirus, and 8 patient are already cured and discharged."

We don't only tend to sick or injured cats, we take in all kinds of kittens, but as it so happens, in December we had one returned to us because she had gotten sick (2 months in -.-') - turns out she had Coronavirus, which is highly infectious and with nasty gastroenteritis symptoms, and before we found out what was wrong with her we managed to infect 2 others. With help from out great vets we pulled through, but then one of the other kittens (we keep them somewhat separated and he did not get Corona) ran a fever and we found out he had calicivirus (again, contagious but unlike Corona, is covered by a vaccine) and also tested positive for panleukopenia. We were SO lucky that he didn't get the panleuk symptoms, because along with calicivirus, it would have been too much for him to handle (3 months old). It appears his mother had it, because he has cerebellar hypoplasia and his walk is a little wobbly. Bonus, he now has developed ringworm as a result of the compromised immune system.

Then last weekend one of our own cats (which didn't get in contact with the fosters) stopped eating and ran a 40.9 fever; after full bloodwork and ultrasounds and all of the rapid tests we do in cats, we still have no clue what was wrong. She has received symptomatic treatment and is now back to normal but left us scratching our heads.

Being a foster parent is such a difficult but so, so rewarding occupation! I can't say job, because we work full time besides fostering the little furballs 😃

I know we have totally hijacked Max's post, but I thought you'd find my little story interesting!"
