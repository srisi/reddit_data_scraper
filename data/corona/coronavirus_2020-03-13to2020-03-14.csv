Also, this is such an incredibly dumb thing to say if you actually want people to take it seriously.



“Now the Democrats are politicizing the coronavirus, you know that, right?”. “Coronavirus, they’re politicizing it. We did one of the great jobs. You say, ‘How’s President Trump doing?’ They go, ‘Oh, not good, not good.’ They have no clue. They don’t have any clue."

As many as 200,000 to 1.7 million people could die. Dr. Lawler’s calculations: 480,000 deaths, which he said was conservative

By contrast, 20,000 to 50,000 people have died from flu-related illnesses this season according to CDC.

2.4 million to 21 million people in the U.S. could require hospitalization, potentially crushing the nation’s medical system, which has only about 925,000 staffed hospital beds. Fewer than a tenth of those are for people who are critically ill

The case fatality rate is NOT simply (deaths/cases). To put it simply, this is because active cases can still die. In fact, the mean time from case confirmation to death is 12-16 days. This  phenomenon is called *lead-time bias.* 

An analogy to help you understand. If you diagnose 1000 cases of lung cancer today and look at how many people are dead after 1 month, you will get a very low case fatality. Instead you have to see how many people die vs go into remission. Those are the outcomes of a case. Keep that model in your head and apply it to this pandemic.

**The closed case fatality (so long as it has a large sample) is the true confirmed case fatality rate. That is CF = (death)/(death + recovered), which currently stands at 7%.**

[https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/](https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/)

More nuance to the confirmed CF calculation includes the fact that it is largely based on the deaths/recoveries from Wuhan. As the number changes with new confirmed cases, deaths, and recoveries in other places, the variables at play here include a given location's:

1. **Age distribution** (more old sick people = higher CF)
2. **Healthcare resources** (ICU/hospital beds, ventilators, etc)
3. **Viral load per transmission** (quarantine measures, tradition of close contact)

Comparing these variables between Wuhan and a new outbreak area will define the direction of change in confirmed CF.

*Note: this is only a calculation of CONFIRMED case fatality. The number of unconfirmed cases that would be required to calculate all case fatality is still largely unknown.*"

**The Infected are 10-20x Higher than the Confirmed Cases**

Best estimates are that 10-20% of cases need hospitalization. So in places without universal testing (most western nations), only 10-20% of infected get sick enough to go to the hospital where they might be tested. 

That 10-20% translates to 5-10x the number of tested cases that are walking around not seeking medical care.

But in the US especially, a lot of folks who are showing up in hospitals are NOT BEING TESTED. 

How much does that increase the 5-10x? Who knows.

If we assume only half the people that should be tested actually ARE being tested (that might be significantly overestimating the testing in the US!), then that means that for every confirmed case there are 10-20 more that are walking around feeling okay, but spreading it.

**The Number of Confirmed Cases Indicates Infection Numbers from Weeks Ago**

With the incubation period and the length of time before people get sick enough to go to the hospital, we know most who test positive (in the nations without universal testing) actually caught the virus 2-3 weeks before.

They get infected, there's a week incubation, maybe they start to feel a scratchy nose like they're coming down with a cold, they get a fever, they don't get better, they go to the hospital, they get tested, then two days later the results show 1 additional confirmed case. But they were infected 2-3 weeks ago.

Italy has implemented massive lockdowns of affected region two weeks ago, and they are still not seeing a slowing of infection rates. Because they got infected before the lockdown.

**Exponential Growth is Unfathomable for Most Humans**

The US has about 1750 confirmed cases as of March 12.

If you make a conservative estimate and assume there are only 10 infections for every confirmed case, that means the infected rate would be 17,500 infected at the same time as the 1750 confirmed cases.

Now if you assume 17,500 were infected only two weeks ago, and you assume 20% growth PER DAY (which is about what we've seen in western nations and below the 24-40% growth we've seen in the US), then you would expect to have about 225,000 infected Americans right now.

**That's a low estimate. 225,000 infected with 1,750 confirmed cases.**

And on March 13 with that fairly low 20% day over day growth, we'd expect that to be 270,000.

* March 14: 325,000
* March 15: 390,000
* March 16: 465,000
* March 17: 560,000

You can see how nuts exponential 20% growth per day is.

If you take even just 25% per day growth (which we've seen just about everywhere), but still figure only a fairly fast 2-week delay between infection and confirmation, that 225,000 number balloons to 400,000 infected with 1,750 cases.

If you figure a 3-week delay... 1.9 million infected for 1,750 confirmed cases.

Rewind a bit and let's assume there weren't just 10 infections per confirmed case, but 20 (due to lack of testing in the US). That means that all those estimated infections would be double. 550,000 low estimate, 800,000 medium estimate, and a high (but not unreasonable) estimate of 3.8 million infected for 1,750 confirmed cases.

**TL;DR: This is real, folks. We need to implement lockdown measures and universal testing to #FlattenTheCurve. And we need to do it yesterday.**

Be well out there. ❤️

Edit: This is all speculation. But based on some real figures, a couple guestimates, and some very simple math.

Based on the data inputs of:

* [1750 confirmed cases on March 12](https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/country/us/)
* [24-40% US day over day growth for the past week, and rarely dipping below 20% for most western countries](https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/country/us/)

Speculation: 

* 10-20% of cases seeking hospital care
* Most US testing being done on people seeking hospital care
* Only half the folks wanting testing being tested in the US.
* 2-3 week delay between infection and confirmation of test result in hospital"
2020-03-13,coronathrowaway_,houston,18,https://www.reddit.com/r/houston/comments/fh1nwf/coronavirus_covid19_megathread_discussion_pt_2/fkdaskz/,"I wanted to give my experience so far with trying to get tested for the coronavirus. Before i do, i will say that i work from home and have been at home since the onset, except going to the clinic.  Leading up to this week, i hadnt traveled internationally only to NY in mid FEB and only had been around town to typical places - grocery store, coffee shops, and resturaunts.

&#x200B;

I came down with illness 2 days ago. First started off as general dizziness and the typical 'spacey' feeling you have when you are sick. By that afternoon i had developed a dry cough, chest discomfort, mild shortness of breath, fever (\~99.5-100.0), body aches and GI issues.  Called an urgent care (owned / operated by one of the large hospitals in Houston), explained my situation, and my concerns about CV. I was told, just come on in, so i did.  I got check for flu and had a chest x-ray.  The flu was negative and the xray didnt show anything of concern. I was told, its likely just the flu, given a prescription for tamiflu and zpack. Started both last night.   Also was told since i'm in a low risk demographic, to not worry about it and that since I haven't traveled internationally or been around a positive case, that I don't meet the standards to be tested.

&#x200B;

Today, i have waves of feeling much worse and waves of feeling slight;y better. So I decided to try to do what i could to get tested - for ease of mind and to better situate myself if i am CV positive.   I reached out to the state health hotline and city.  Both asked general questions about symptoms, travel history and exposure and told me that since i had not been out of the country or been around a confirmed carrier, I don't meet the standards to be tested. From here I reached out to another large hospital hotline.  They were more helpful with the others since i was talking to an actual person with medical background, but same outcome - didnt meet the standards to be tested.  I told this person, i feel like I'm in a catch 22, that since essential no testing has been completed in houston, no way to know if i had been around someone with CV.  The person tended to agree, but they had their marching orders to who qualifies and who doesn't.

&#x200B;

After that, I reached out to a couple more clinics with similar results. My experience tells me the city of Houston is not ready for this if it turns into an outbreak.  I feel like i would be the exact kind of person to test - no other factors to expose me outside of normal day-to-day life in Houston.  I am going to try a couple more places tomorrow, fingers crossed that either the meds i was prescribed start kicking in and this is a nothing burger for me, or I'm able to get a test done if I'm still sick.

EDIT: Let me add, that this has been frustrating as hell. I feel like I am doing everything the local, state and federal government has asked us to do, and I can only get stonewalled at every turn.

In Washington State, where more than 30 people have died from the virus, more than anywhere else in the country, public health officials have escalated through most of a 13-step strategy checklist for controlling infectious outbreaks and now have only a few remaining options: closing workplaces, restricting people to their homes and cordoning off targeted areas to help control the spread of infection, measures that have already been put in place in other parts of the world.
Political leaders are considering their options, alarmed over research that suggests 400 people in the Seattle area could die in the coming weeks if the trajectory of the outbreak cannot be altered. The research shows that if policymakers could reduce the transmission rate by 75 percent — primarily through what is known as “social distancing” — then the number of deaths could be reduced to only about 30 in that period.

Kevin Wickersham, the incident commander at Washington’s Department of Health, said that none of the options were off the table, but that officials were mindful of the tremendous burden that such restrictions could impose on families and businesses.

“We want to do everything possible to keep society functioning as much as it possibly can,” Mr. Wickersham said."

* **Crisis will last** for at least **several weeks** and **possibly 2 months or more**

Between **160 million and 214 million people in the U.S.** could be infected (Worst case scenario). Dr. Lawler, an infectious diseases specialist, provided a “best guess” projections of **96 million people**

Could last **months or even over a year**

As many as **200,000 to 1.7 million people could die**. Dr. Lawler’s calculations: **480,000 deaths**, which he said was conservative

By contrast, **20,000 to 50,000 people have died from flu-related illnesses** this season according to CDC.

You're young and healthy and don't think  this thing will have that big an impact on you if you catch it. You're probably right. Maybe at some point in the future, after all this has died down and the full scope of the problem is known- after numerous people have died and the economy has taken its lumps, you'll boast about having made it through this pandemic without ever catching the virus. But eventually they'll have a test to verify if you've ever contracted coronavirus in the past. Full of confidence you'll take this test, already knowing it'll be negative. But it could just as easily come back positive. Having never shown any symptoms, you'll wonder when you had it, or who you contacted it from. Later, you'll sickeningly come to the realization that you very well could have unknowingly transmitted the virus to someone else, who, in turn, infected other people and so on. Finally, with an overwhelming feeling of guilt growing in your stomach, you may realize that it's possible you're the reason the death count was X much higher than it could have been.

2020-03-13,Midnightapalooza,Anxiety,12,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/eupik4/coronavirus_megathread/fkezb7w/,"Let’s get some good news going in here, shall we? Feel like it’s been a bit since I’ve seen anyone compile some positive news, so I’ll try to keep an eye on this stuff and post regularly over the next couple of days. 

First off, [I really loved this interview.](https://www.cbsnews.com/video/dr-anthony-fauci-top-expert-on-infectious-diseases-says-its-not-too-late-for-broader-coronavirus-testing-system/#) Dr. Fauci, who is essentially in charge of managing the outbreak in the US, went on CBS where he calmly, rationally, and responsibly shared some information regarding the virus while the news anchor was asking some really fear-mongering questions. He says that he expects widespread testing to begin within the week, he says that it’s not too late to get the testing started, he goes into further detail clarifying one of his statements which was sort of twisted by the media... it’s just really good to see him respond rationally to the types of questions that we might be asking when we’re the most scared. 

I’ve said so many times in this thread that we shouldn’t obsess over the numbers, but I think there’s a handful of positive points to note right now to hopefully help us feel better. First, Dr. Fauci alluded in that video to the fact that China appears to be well past its peak now. They reported single digit new cases yesterday, and today have only reported 22. Their closed case fatality rate has dropped down to 5% as well, and we can probably anticipate it to drop a bit more if it follows its current trend. Despite South Korea’s extensive testing, they’re only reporting 110 new cases (out of potentially 22,000 tested, that’s really good!), and these kings among men are showing that **99%** of their cases are mild, and are reporting a case fatality rate of **0.089%**. They deserve some awards when this is all over. Globally, good news too- the trend of mild cases increasing has continued, its gone up 1% each day for at least a week now, without fail, and we’re now looking at **91%** of all cases globally being reported as “mild”. [All of these numbers can be found here.](https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/)

Let’s run through a few positive recovery stories next.  [Here’s a really positive story about a school in Rhode Island which had to shut down, but is now preparing to reopen after taking a ton of amazing steps to protect its students](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.bostonglobe.com/2020/03/13/metro/coronavirus-ri-one-schools-story-worry-recovery-resiliency/%3foutputType=amp). The [first person who tested positive in Oklahoma has recovered.](https://www.google.com/amp/s/kfor.com/health/coronavirus/report-first-person-to-test-positive-for-coronavirus-in-oklahoma-has-recovered/amp/) A [woman in Seattle has recovered after a mild case of the disease, and she shared her story to inspire hope in people and encourage them not to panic- she’s an extremely positive beacon of light we can all look up to right now, I loved this one personally.](https://news.yahoo.com/dont-panic-says-us-woman-recovered-coronavirus-055155667.html) I’m sure we all saw the news about Tom Hanks and Rita Wilson being confirmed positive, [but look at both their optimism](https://www.google.com/amp/s/fox8.com/news/coronavirus/we-are-taking-it-one-day-at-a-time-tom-hanks-rita-wilson-offer-update-on-coronavirus-recovery/amp/) and the optimism of [their kids as well](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.yahoo.com/amphtml/entertainment/tom-hanks-and-rita-wilsons-kids-share-update-after-parents-coronavirus-diagnosis-they-will-make-a-full-recovery-143805807.html). 

One last thing because this rumor is popping up, yet again- [no, you can’t get COVID-19 twice](https://thehill.com/changing-america/well-being/prevention-cures/487436-can-you-get-coronavirus-twice). 

I have a whole bunch of other facts I really want to share, but I don’t want to overwhelm anyone with information. I want to go in deeper on why the fears about tests in the U.S. aren’t worth panicking over, I want to talk about the rate of infection, I want to talk about the fatality rate, I want to talk about various rumors I’ve seen and provide sources to debunk them (like the whole “dogs can get it too” meme)... I’ve got a lot I want to address. I think I’m going to attempt to post twice a day for at least the next few days with this kind of information, more positive stories, more recovery stories, more debunking myths, all with sources. I think we need a bit more of that around here at the moment. 

Anyways, if anyone has any questions on any of this, feel free to ask! Keep your heads high, brave faces on, stay off social media, wash your hands... we’re going to get through this! I feel very optimistic about it, still, and I honestly believe we’re going to be beyond this in a few month’s time."

>China has infrastructure and protocols left over from the SARS epidemic in 2002-2003 that they kept and brought back out for SARS COV-2. Body temperature checkpoints at places like train stations and public buildings, fever clinics that you have to go straight to if your temp reads too high, rapid CT scan tech and actual test kits at the clinics, and quarantine hospitals if you're found to be infected. All of this is designed to funnel an infected person away from their family, because 80% of cases involved family member transmission. You don't even get to leave the clinic until they have a confirmed test result.

>We have no plans like this in the US.

And neither does India. No one does. So that's where the 70% estimate comes from. Outside of China, we are collectively without a game plan."

Colorado’s new drive-through coronavirus-testing station in Denver made its debut Wednesday and was quickly overwhelmed. At one point Thursday, the line of cars with passengers waiting to be swabbed was almost four hours long, until the state cut off the service for the day.

Drive-through checks for Covid-19, with health workers in protective gear swabbing noses through car windows, was part of South Korea’s largely successful strategy for containing the virus: The country tested more than 200,000 in a matter of weeks, a stark contrast to the U.S., where testing has proceeded at a crawl.

The nation’s testing is “failing -- let’s admit it,” National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases Anthony Fauci told Congress Thursday.

This week, a handful of states are deploying their own drive-through operations. New York opened its first Friday in New Rochelle, the epicenter of its outbreak. New Hampshire set up an operation this week.

At the same time, hospitals and clinics in some states have begun offering free drive-through testing. The idea is to quickly grasp how many people are sick, and to keep the infected from transmitting the virus in waiting rooms.

What You Need to Know About the Coronavirus Pandemic: QuickTake

In announcing Colorado’s first testing station, Department of Public Health and Environment Director Jill Hunsaker Ryan said more testing is among the most effective measures to slow the virus, because “those who test positive can be isolated from the general population as we continue to stress the need for personal action,” such as staying home when sick and washing hands.

The Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota, and the M Health Fairview system in Minneapolis both launched free drive-through testing Thursday. UW Medicine in Seattle has been using it for staff and University of Washington faculty since March 6, and is planning to expand it to patients.

A hospital in the Chicago suburb of Barrington is setting up operations in its emergency room driveway. Dallas-based Tenet Healthcare chain is considering testing stations in some of its hospital parking lots, according to the Modern Healthcare journal.

Giving Directions

Officials from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services and the Department of Health and Human Services met Friday with executives from Walmart, Target, CVS, Walgreens, Laboratory Corp. of America Holdings, Quest Diagnostics and Roche Diagnostics to discuss developing a web portal that would direct people to such testing stations, according to people familiar with the plan. The people asked not to be named discussing internal deliberations.

The drive-through operations typically require people to either participate in phone or online pre-screening or be referred by a physician: The Mayo Clinic tells people where the testing is being done only after determining that someone in fact should get a test. Colorado requires people to bring a note from a doctor. Those tested then are advised to quarantine themselves while waiting for results.

Colorado warned drivers that they couldn’t exit their cars while in line, and advised them to bring food and water in anticipation of a wait.

Virus Marathon

The length of Thursday’s line was a surprise. Even with prescreening and the warning, waits stretched to nearly four hours before the state shut it down. The health department announced a new protocol the next day: The station in Denver’s Lowry neighborhood would take only the first 100 to 150 cars, and direct cars after that to seek out a private provider.

The state closed the station early Friday because of cold weather that could compromise health workers’ protective gear. It was poised to open again on Saturday.

“There’s no point in getting angry,” Nicole Fasano told a Denver television station Thursday after waiting two hours for a drive-up test for her toddler.

She said she planned to just “go home and quarantine ourselves and take care of the little guy.”"

>The FA chairman Greg Clarke has told the Premier League that he does not think the domestic football season will be completed, sparking fears of huge financial repercussions for the clubs.

>Clarke attended the emergency Premier League meeting in London yesterday, which concluded by suspending the Premier League, EFL, the FA Women’s Super League and the Women’s Championship until April 3 in response to a series of coronavirus cases across the game.

>The risk to the top flight, and indeed to Uefa, of not completing the season is that it could jeopardise billions of pounds in TV money. For the Premier League alone, losses could amount to as much as £750 million.

>One senior figure in broadcasting said: “The commercial reality for the Premier League and Uefa is that if they don’t complete their seasons then they are in breach of their broadcasting contracts.

>“You would have broadcasters from all around the world saying, ‘In that case we are not paying for the season.’ For the Premier League alone you are talking around £3 billion income a year from overseas and domestic TV rights.

>“There would also be financial implications if the competitions were squeezed, so fewer matches were played. Again, broadcasters have signed contracts for an agreed number of matches and so if those matches are not played then it could be argued that the contracts have been breached and compensation must be paid.”

>At the Premier League meeting yesterday, it was Clarke who addressed the elephant in the room when he said that he did not think it was “feasible” the season would be completed. Government guidance has suggested that coronavirus will not peak until about mid-June. Clarke clearly thinks that a rise in coronavirus cases will simply make it impossible for clubs to honour their fixtures.

>It is understood that Paul Barber, the Brighton & Hove Albion chief executive, responded by questioning the wisdom of suspending matches only until the start of next month if the situation is going escalate well into the summer.

>Richard Masters, the Premier League chief executive, responded by saying that although he recognised the challenges ahead should the forecast prove correct, the temporary suspension would at least give them time to consider the potential consequences and debate the possible solutions. At present, Liverpool sit 25 points clear at the top of the Premier League table with nine games remaining.

>Before news broke late last night that Mikel Arteta, the Arsenal manager, had tested positive for coronavirus, the Premier League had announced its intention to follow government advice by holding games as normal this weekend.

>Many of the clubs, however, had already told Masters that they favoured a temporary suspension and in an email to clubs on Thursday night the Premier League, Masters stressed that “contractual commitments” needed to be taken into consideration.

>Financially, the damage is likely to be widespread. The next few weeks will also prove costly to broadcasters such as Sky Sports and BT Sport, who depend on live sport. Insiders say the channels will have committed to production costs that will run into millions, and they will also be hit by a drop in advertising revenue and the likelihood of subscribers cancelling their contracts."

> Given that the vast majority of cases have occurred in a country with poor health care, that’s going to dramatically exaggerate the death rate.

> Both the surgeon general and head of the CDC have advised we nix the masks; they don’t work. Instead, wash your hands with hot water and soap or an alcohol solution for at least 10 to 20 seconds.

## Don’t believe the numbers you see’

In the U.S. there are over 1,600 confirmed cases, [according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/cases-in-us.html) (CDC), with 41 deaths. Makary said that the number of cases, though, is likely much higher. 

“Don’t believe the numbers when you see, even on our Johns Hopkins website, that 1,600 Americans have the virus,” he said. “No, that means 1,600 got the test, tested positive. There are probably 25 to 50 people who have the virus for every one person who is confirmed.” 

He added: “I think we have between 50,000 and half a million cases right now walking around in the United States.”

Part of the reason the number of cases might be higher without people realizing it is because of the shortage of coronavirus testing kits from the CDC. Between Jan. 18 and March 12, there were 13,624 [tests for COVID-19](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/testing-in-us.html) conducted in the U.S. Meanwhile, South Korea [has conducted over 100,000 tests](https://www.economist.com/graphic-detail/2020/03/07/tourism-flows-and-death-rates-suggest-covid-19-is-being-under-reported), and the U.K. has [tested nearly 25,000 people](https://www.bbc.com/news/health-51814874)."

Trump’s handling of the crisis - from his autocrat-style press conferences to mismanaging the CDC and spotlighting random companies and lying about testing - are all manifestations of the republican way of doing things, and criticism can not be apolitical.

So the hot take part here is this: Bernie trying to shill his plan at this time isn’t the worst thing by itself; Biden’s coronavirus address was political football as well since he’s not in power.

The real problem is that Bernie’s solutions are snake oil and would not work. Even if we had an M4A setup that worked well and had been for decades, they would still be overwhelmed right now, still make other kinds of mistakes, the testing problem would be similar, and there would still be rationing of care. Signing M4A doesn’t mean that suddenly there are an unlimited number of ventilators available. 

This is why Bernie sucks. He’s not a details guy. He thinks he can sign a bill, and it’s easy to just transition the current system to VA healthcare for all and it’s just a moral failing that no one else has been able to do it. His supporters are worse, but it’s not about them right now."

According to [El Financiero](https://www.elfinanciero.com.mx/nacional/sube-a-15-el-numero-de-casos-confirmados-de-coronavirus-en-mexico) Mexico only has 15 cases of COVID-19 confirmed and 82 not confirmed, which according to “traffic light phases” is Phase 1. 

Phase 1 means that there are only “dozens” of cases and those are “imported” from infected countries, this means it’s possible to track down the origin and give treatment accordingly. In this phase, there are NO restrictions for public events, gatherings and normal activities. 

Phase 2 is expected to hit Mexico in 15 days (end of March), where public events and gatherings would be suspended.

To give extra context, LaLiga MX (soccer) which is the most popular sport in the country is still going ahead without any issues, this means people are still allowed in stadiums.

As you know, to determine the University of Calgary’s response to the increased number of cases of COVID-19 (coronavirus) locally, nationally and internationally, classes were temporarily suspended on Friday to allow us time to consult with students, faculty, staff, other institutions and the relevant authorities.

 

As a result of that consultation we have decided that when classes resume on Monday they will not be in-person. Instead, UCalgary will move to alternate forms of course delivery until the COVID-19 situation has stabilized.

 

Instructors have been preparing for the possibility of moving to remote learning and have prepared lesson plans accordingly. We have invested in new technology platforms and we hope this transition will be relatively seamless. We will also be moving to alternate forms of final assessment. This move will not cause any student to lose credits or the ability to graduate.

 

We are taking this step out of an abundance of caution. I want to stress that we are aware of no cases of COVID-19 on campus and Alberta Health continues to assess the risk to our community to be low.

 

By suspending in-person classes – and eliminating the large groupings of people that come with them – we hope to further reduce this low risk and keep our university family safe.

 

The University of Calgary will remain open, and staff and faculty will be at work. All services remain available; we are here to support you during these difficult times.

 

I would like to thank the university scholars and staff who have worked directly – and tirelessly – on tackling COVID-19 and improving the global situation. I would also like to thank you all for the measures you take: washing your hands, forgoing handshakes, coughing into your arm, staying home when you are sick and avoiding crowded areas.

 

These measures may seem small, but they are vitally important. They protect the most vulnerable among us and they are, ultimately, what will allow us to beat back this dangerous disruption.

 

Even absent from our community, COVID-19 has already had a significant impact on our lives. I want you to know we take these steps today because the safety of both the university and the broader community is of the utmost importance for us.

 

Students, you will be hearing from your instructors as to how we will proceed on Monday. The most up-to-date information on UCalgary’s COVID-19 response can be found at UCalgary.ca and we will continue to send out regular updates.

 

We sincerely appreciate your support and patience as we work together in these trying times."""""""

>Wall Street’s concern and confusion surrounding the coronavirus was in full view Friday, as the Dow’s 1,200-point opening volley deflated, erasing most gains, by lunchtime. Then the blue chip index got its second wind after President Trump declared a state of emergency over the pandemic.

>The Dow Jones industrial average shot up nearly 2,000 points, about 10 percent. The Standard & Poor’s 500 and Nasdaq also surged more than 9 percent. It was Wall Street’s biggest rally since 2008.

>Friday’s moves were in line with the hyperactive trading on display all week. S&P 500 futures spiked 5 percent, triggering the New York Stock Exchange’s “limit up” brake that’s designed to temper excessive optimism and ensure orderly trading at the open. On Thursday, Wall Street’s had its worst trading day since the 1987 crash. The brutal sell-off came even as central banks around the world moved to shore up the economy against coronavirus fallout, which has battered global markets for weeks and disrupted many facets of daily life.

>“The day-to-day volatility is a sign that investors don’t know what to do,” David Donabedian, chief investment officer of CIBC Private Wealth Management, wrote in commentary Friday.“ People are casting about so the period of extraordinary volatility is probably not over.

the chinese *municipal government* that tried to cover this up was driven by not knowing what it was and the fear of being held responsible for causiing a false positive public panic. As soon as the situation got exposed to public it took the *central government* no more than a week to take over and start systematic procedure to contain the virus, which at this point are factually proven to be effective in slowing down the pandemic.

Days before the milan lockdown, italian government officials were comparing this to a flu and said things like it's only so bad in china because they have poor healthcare system, the coronavirus won't be so much of a problem in italy. Look at where they are now.

US had to know how infectious this virus from the get go, had talkingheads on TV saying it's nothing more than a flu for at least 2 weeks, promised to test up to millions more in the past week(which didn't happen btw), and is still not giving greenlights to even test most of the patients.

FINALLY, SOME GOOD NEWS: WARM WEATHER SHOWN TO SLOW CORONAVIRUS SPREAD

LET THE SUNSHINE IN.

Warm weather has been correlated with a slowdown in the spread of COVID-19.

The paper comes from a squad of data scientists and economists at Beijing schools Tsinghua University and Beihang University, using data from the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, related to 4,711 confirmed cases of the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus.

2020-03-13,KinnerNevada,Coronavirus,8,https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/fi3zcv/fears_rise_for_world_leaders_as_officials_test/fkexyow/,"LONDON — Even as governments around the world struggle to contain the coronavirus pandemic, many officials are themselves falling victim to the pathogen, undermining global efforts to address the crisis.

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau of Canada put himself in isolation after his wife tested positive, and a number of other senior officials from Britain to Iran to Australia were confirmed to be infected. President Jair Bolsonaro of Brazil said on Friday that he tested negative, after one of his aides tested positive.

There is, though, rising concern that President Donald Trump and members of his staff and cabinet might have been exposed in meetings with different officials from overseas, including with Mr. Bolsonaro’s aide.

In a closely connected political world where officials crisscross the globe as they take part in frequent meetings with heads of state and other policymakers, the cases vividly illustrate how no one is immune from a virus that does not distinguish between the powerful and everyone else.
The exposures follow what has already been a troubled, inconsistent and sometimes chaotic response by many governments around the world.

“It doesn’t matter if you are the leader of one of the greatest democracy in the world or not, you too can get the coronavirus,”  Dr. Leslie Vinjamuri, the director of the U.S. and Americas Program at the Chatham House research group in London.

The risk is that entire cabinets or senior government officials could be sidelined at once, potentially undermining an already complex response.

“Any number of cabinets are going to be having endless meetings where they are going to be discussing these scenarios and coming up with plans in real time,” she said.

Mr. Bolsonaro was a guest of Mr. Trump at the Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida last weekend, along with an entourage including his press secretary, who later tested positive. Mr. Bolsonaro posted on Twitter that he had tested negative for the virus, a short time after some local news outlets reported the opposite.
In Canada, Sophie Grégoire Trudeau, Mr. Trudeau’s wife, tested positive for the virus on Thursday after becoming mildly ill. Last week she had traveled to Britain with her daughter and with Margaret Trudeau, the prime minister’s mother, to take part in a charity event. She was part of a panel with Julia Gillard, the former Australian prime minister.

Get an informed guide to the global outbreak with our daily coronavirus newsletter.
Mr. Trudeau will remain in isolation for the next two weeks, his office said in a statement, as will some members of his cabinet. Because he has not been out of the country recently and displays no symptoms, Canadian doctors followed current medical protocols and have not tested the prime minister.

Several other Canadian politicians who feel ill, including members of his cabinet and Jagmeet Singh, the leader of an opposition party, have also voluntarily quarantined themselves.

On Friday, lawmakers voted unanimously to suspend Parliament in Canada until April 20.

Australia’s minister for home affairs, Peter Dutton, announced on Friday that he had tested positive for the virus.

He had woken up with a fever and a sore throat just a week after he met with Attorney General William P. Barr, Ivanka Trump and senior security officials from the so-called “five eyes” alliance of the United States, the United Kingdom, Canada and New Zealand.

Only a week ago, Mr. Dutton, a hard-line conservative and former police officer, thought nothing of promoting the series of meetings on Twitter.

He posted a photo of himself standing at a podium in front of Mr. Barr, and the Australian embassy in the United States later posted a photo on Twitter showing Mr. Dutton alongside Ms. Trump."

In case anyone is curious about the process:
  
Called my primary care doctor. Who incorrectly told me to call the Oklahoma Health Department. Do not do that. I was on hold for nearly an hour to be told to contact my primary care doctor. 
  
He then told me to call the ER, ask for the charge nurse, tell them he sent me, and tell them why I was calling, don’t just show up. I explained that I’d been exposed to someone who was a confirmed case and that I’d had mild symptoms. Plus I’m supposed to fly somewhere for work soon. She told me to come in, but to call when I arrive.  
  
I showed up, walked in and called. When a nurse answered, she asked if I was the CoronaVirus person, and told me to leave immediately and stand out in the parking lot. Made sense. Luckily it was a nice day. 
  
My nurse met me with a mask to put on and let me into a negative pressure room. They closed the door and out signs all over it. Everyone who came in was in full protective gear. The doctor had a respirator with a hose, eye mask and everything.  
  
Two nose swabs and one throat. The nose swabs suck. At that point they were going to discharge me, but nobody seemed to know how or when I would get my results. This is a new thing at this scale, and procedures aren’t streamlined yet. The ER process took about 2.5 hours. 
  
I’m expecting my results in the next day or two. The ER doctor called me this evening and told me that some samples have to be flown to Dallas because we don’t have the capacity here. 
  
After seeing the process at this stage, they are going to get overwhelmed quickly. If I didn’t have to fly twice per week for work I probably wouldn’t have gotten tested and just stayed home sick."

Coronavirus is an airborne virus.

Most hospitals have a very limited number of airborne isolation rooms. Maybe 2-4 for each floor. So let's say there are 7 floors in a hospital like they last one I worked at, that's roughly....14-28 potential airborne isolation rooms. Maybe there's a few more in the ICU, so we'll say that to round up, a moderate sized hospital has right 30-36 airborne isolation rooms in the entire hospital.

Now, assuming those rooms aren't already full or occupied with other patients, chickenpox, TB, overflow, that's 30-36 rooms in the entire hospital for Covid19. 

So 36 patients. And that's in a roughly 800 need hospital. Smaller hospitals have far less. 

So that means that out of 800 patients, only 36 Covid19 patients can be properly isolated, and again, that's IF those rooms aren't already in use.

These are people that actually get tested. 

How many people did they come in contact with? How many days did they do to work sick? How many of those people had to work sick? On and on and on.

Last week they only had one patient and they project they won't be able to deal with patient influx in 2 weeks. 

They have tested employees who had intensive contact with the positively tested patients, but only 5 out of 315 of employees tested postive, but none of them had any symptoms. It seems the current CDC countermeasures and advice are mainly aimed at slowing the spread of infections down, so the hospital won't receive hundreds of patients at once which was the main problem in Italy.

Basically everywhere on the internet right now (especially places like the coronavirus subreddit), people are becoming very combative towards neutral or good news.

Basically every time something encouraging is posted, it's shortly rationalized by the hordes to be inconsequential, false, unlikely, or the result of uninformed speculation.

There's a big unspoken secret about this habit (as I have come to understand it):

Many of these people are actually looking to be reassured. 

The main reason I can make this claim is because I've felt the urge myself. The instinct to curtail the optimism of others, as I hope to be crushed tenfold by someone else, who might know more than me (and therefore give me a reason to be optimistic). In true anxiety lingo they call this ""reassurance seeking"". 

It's fundamentally a fear/anxiety response, and proof that human communication is endlessly difficult.

I guess what I'm saying is that even if these people are frustrating and appear to be fetishizing a tragedy, a large number of them are probably terrified themselves.

That said, it's not anyone's responsibly to tolerate empty panic, especially when it's damaging to one's own mental health-- and I'm certainly not excusing the behavior either. 

I just found it to be a helpful thought; remembering that if some rando quotes a terrifying (and apocryphal) story or statistic, keeping in mind that they're, in all likelihood, dumping their own worst fears on anyone nearby to make this whole situation hurt a little less.

Hopefully this is helpful for someone. We're all gonna be okay."

That marks two days in a row with new cases in the single digits, and the rest of the nation saw no new locally transmitted infections.

In addition to the five locally transmitted cases in Wuhan, the nation saw two new cases in Shanghai and one in Beijing, and all of three of those were the result of infected people entering the country.

There will be some economic assistance - mostly to corporations.  They're increasing the strategic petroleum reserves because 'the price is right', but those don't stand to help with the crisis in any way.  And they're waiving student loan interest - so for the select few who have subsidized student loans (who only pay interest while in college), they won't have to worry about making the payments.

There will be some money earmarked for small businesses as well, which is nice.  But if you were a temporary or hourly employee laid off, or someone working for gratuities, in the travel industry, etc. - you are basically just as f\*\*ed as you were before, just your tax bill will be higher if you have enough to declare.

**Stone:** ""You would basically have three options. Declare the season void - and restart next season with the same teams that started this one in the same division, or have promotion and relegation, either using this season's positions as they currently are or having play-offs.

""All of these scenarios are controversial, which is why the preference is to finish the current campaign - it's just that no-one knows when that will be.

""There are nine Premier League games to be played, plus three FA Cup rounds, plus Europe. Given a clear window, you are looking at about six weeks to complete the calendar, using midweek games.""

#Will Liverpool win the Premier League title no matter what?

**Stone:** ""I don't think we can say 'no matter what' because the option of scrapping this season does exist. However, everyone recognises that would be exceptionally harsh on Jurgen Klopp's men.

""Scrapping this season is not the option being thought of as preferable at this stage. The aim is definitely to end the current campaign at some point.""

#What is the likelihood of the season being completely null and void?

**Stone:** ""It is very much the will of all the leagues and the majority of the clubs for that not to happen.

""There are so many complications that come with making a decision of that magnitude. Clearly, no-one knows how long the game will be in shut down for. But whenever it restarts, I would think it will restart by finishing off this season.

""It is not entirely clear whether players will carry on training. We are in completely uncharted territory here.""

#If coronavirus lasts for the next six months, does that mean no football will be played in that period?

**Stone:** ""It is possible, yes. In theory, matches could be played this weekend. It is the clubs who have made the decision today - the government said on Thursday that matches could continue for now.

""No-one, certainly not me, knows how long the current situation will last for. I don't see matches being played until the coronavirus problem has passed its peak point, which the medical experts said yesterday could be between 10 and 14 weeks.

""Given the medical advice, I don't think anyone in football seriously expects the situation to have changed in three weeks and therefore the present situation is much more likely to be extended than lifted.""

#What happens about player contracts if the season is not finished by 30 June - as well as other extra fees such as for appearances and goals?

**Stone:** ""This is a complex area. Obviously players whose contracts run beyond the end of this season will get bonuses based on the current campaign, whenever it finishes.

""However, for those whose deals expire on 30 June, it is a different situation entirely. In addition, the transfer window will be open.

""These issues will form part of the fall-out from Uefa's meeting on Tuesday, which is expected to outline the best way forward for the European game as a whole. The players - as well as the leagues - will be represented.""

#Could next season be delayed - and if so, to when?

**Stone:** ""Yes. And as long as is required. If the current season doesn't finish until the summer, there will need to be flexibility about when the next campaigns start.

""A Uefa source told me yesterday that nothing was off the table. Anything is possible.""

#Will there be any financial assistance to lower league clubs who will have no income for the next month?

**Stone**: ""I don't know if the EFL has enough money to start handing out bridging loans. Like most businesses, clubs will have to find a way round their present situation.""

#Will lower leagues be suspended because of the risk of attracting larger crowds from other clubs?

**Stone:** ""It is a fair point. I suspect it falls into the 'cross the bridge when it comes to it' category. I can't see why a local side that attracts 100 fans should be stopped from playing.

""Junior matches will still go on also. There has to be a line drawn somewhere. It would be illogical to say 'no-one can play football'.

#Why is the National League continuing?

**Stone:** ""To repeat, it is the Premier League and EFL clubs plus the Football Association who took Friday's decision. Government advice on Thursday was that matches could continue.

""The National League has taken the option to follow government advice. Notts County average attendances of more than 5,000, so there are plenty of fans who follow that level of the game anyway.

""If clubs get overwhelmed by spectators, I guess the National League may have a rethink but for now, for them, it is business as usual.""

#What will happen to TV deals?

**Stone:** ""The big unknown is how the broadcasters react to this situation. BBC, BT, Premier Sports and Sky pay huge amounts of money to screen football.

""The latter three use football to drive their subscriptions. If there is no football, what happens to the subscription numbers and, in turn, their ability to pay the contracts.

""As with so many things, the length of time this shutdown goes on for will determine what happens next.""

#What about payments given to clubs depending on league position - what will they get?

**Stone:** ""If the Premier League has its way, they will get the payments they are supposed to get because the season will finish. Anything else is guesswork at this stage."""

## Many of us were too selfish too follow suggestions to change our behavior. Now we’re in lockdown and people are needlessly dying.

ROME – “As in any war, we have to choose who to treat and who not.”

That was a headline on March 9th in Il Corriere della Sera, a leading newspaper in Italy, that informed us that hospitals in Italy’s north, the epicenter of the coronavirus outbreak in our country, were being stretched thin and the health care system was on the brink of collapse.

An anesthesiologist at a hospital in Bergamo, one of the cities with the most cases of Covid-19, the illness caused by the new coronavirus, told the paper that the intensive care unit was already at capacity, and doctors were being forced to start making difficult triage decisions, admitting people who desperately need mechanical ventilation based on age, life expectancy, and other factors. Just like in wartime. The article was inexplicably placed on page 15, while the main headline on the newspaper’s front page relayed the political quarrels over the measures to curb the contagion.

The hospital in Bergamo was not the only hospital in the area dealing with a lack of capacity and rationing of care. The same day, I heard from a manager in the Lombardy health care system, among the most advanced and well-funded in Europe, that he saw anesthesiologists weeping in the hospital hallways because of the choices they are going to have to make.

In the days since, overwhelmed hospitals have set up tents as makeshift hospital wards, and cargo containers have been placed at the entrances of medical centers to sort out patients coming at an increasing pace. Some of the people who can’t get medical care are dying in their homes.

As more medical professionals started to describe similar situations on social media and in interviews, the Italian society of anesthesiologists published new, extraordinary guidelines to help doctors facing ethical dilemmas, making clear that the “first come, first served” criterion that had been used among patients with the same illnesses and level of risk in ordinary times was not appropriate in dealing with the current emergency.

Until last week, the Italian public health care system had the capacity to care for everyone. Our country has universal healthcare, so patients aren’t turned away from hospitals here. But in a matter of days, the system was being felled by a virus that I, and many other Italians, had failed to take seriously.

The inability of the medical system to deal with the flow of patients in critical condition is not one of the problems of this complex medical emergency. It is *the* problem. I shouldn’t have been surprised. As a journalist, I had read, heard, and spoken to several experts explaining that the most immediate threat of Covid-19 was the hospital system becoming overwhelmed, and therefore the most pressing need was to avoid too many people getting sick at the same time, as resources are limited. (It’s what’s called “flattening the curve.”)

But that information was somehow stored in some remote interstice of my mind, covered by an incessant flow of bits and charts on the mortality rate of the elderly, political mismanagement, quarrels over under-testing and over-testing, market collapses, projections on the economic impact of the epidemic, and so on. All of this is, of course, extremely relevant — but at the same time feels totally irrelevant when lives are being lost in a situation that was preventable. As of Friday afternoon, 1,016 people have died in Italy due to the outbreak."

Disney+ continues to lose money. Currently Disney gets like $16 per cable subscribers. Their streaming service is $11(Disney+, Hulu, ESPN+). So even if they manage to convert cable subscribers to their online subscription bundle, they are going to earn less money until they gain pricing power.

* Donald Trump on Friday afternoon declared a national emergency to address the ongoing Coronavirus pandemic.
The declaration, made from the White House Rose Garden during a press conference, comes as the Trump administration grapples with the ongoing outbreak.

* Trump in his remarks said that as part of the national emergency declaration, “the action I am taking will open up $50 billion.”

* There’s been an ongoing concern about the availability of tests for the Coronavirus. Trump said his team expected “half a million additional tests will be available early next week.” “Which will bring probably 1.4 million tests next week and five million in a month,” Trump said. “Our overriding goal is to stop the spread of the virus.”

* Trump, flanked by aides including vice-president Mike Pence and Dr. Deborah Birx, also said the move will waive a number of other requirements meant to benefit doctors and fight the Coronavirus pandemic.

* Trump moved on to introducing representatives from partner organizations working with the White House to combat the Coronavirus. They include representatives from Walmart, Walgreens, LHC Group, Signify Health.

* Most of the business people gave brief remarks about how eager their respective companies are to help.

* Trump then said as part of the Coronavirus response “we’ll be changing a lot of the rules and regulations for future.” [SIC]

* “I guess that’ll continue to an extent but we hope it never happens but we’ll be changing a lot of the wholes and speculations,” Trump said. Trump added that “I’ve waived interest on all student loans held by government agencies.”

* The president said he instructed secretary of energy Dan Brouillette to buy “large quantities” of gasoline “in the US strategic reserve.”"

Projections are that we could lose hundreds of thousands of people to this disease. Our total military & civilian death toll for WWII was 418,500 people.

[https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/13/us/coronavirus-deaths-estimate.html](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/13/us/coronavirus-deaths-estimate.html)

>Between 160 million and 214 million people in the U.S. could be infected over the course of the epidemic, according to one projection. That could last months or even over a year, with infections concentrated in shorter periods, staggered across time in different communities, experts said. As many as 200,000 to 1.7 million people could die.

This crisis makes 2008 look like stubbing one's toe on an end table.

And the response is being managed by a raging narcissist with the foresight of a hamster. The guy he put in charge of the response (Pence) is an idiot who believes you can pray away the gay, wrote an editorial claiming that tobacco doesn't cause cancer, and exacerbated the last public health crisis he was charged with responding to."
2020-03-13,jchang23,Coronavirus,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/fi6m1l/chinas_internet_users_foil_censors_to_keep_a/fkff8x5/,"BEIJING—Chinese censors rushed to suppress a magazine interview with a Wuhan doctor who was silenced after she alerted others to the new coronavirus now spreading across the globe.

But her interview, first published in Mandarin, is now rocketing around the internet in English, French, Hebrew, Farsi, Morse code—and a mashup of Elvish and Klingon.

The translations are part of an effort by Chinese internet users to preserve the interview, in which Ai Fen, a doctor at Wuhan Central Hospital, recalled sounding alarm bells in December about a mysterious illness that was later identified as the new coronavirus.

The story was censored soon after the Chinese magazine People published it on Tuesday, the same day President Xi Jinping made his first visit to the central city of Wuhan since it was identified as the center of the epidemic in January.

In the interview, Dr. Ai recounts warning her superiors at her hospital on Dec. 30 that lab results showed a patient had been infected by “SARS coronavirus,” the same family of viruses that killed nearly 800 world-wide after emerging in China in 2002.

“I was so scared I broke out in a cold sweat,” she told the magazine. “I knew it was trouble.”

Dr. Ai said she sent the results, along with a video clip of another patient’s lung scans, to a medical-school classmate. Those were eventually passed to other doctors, including Li Wenliang, the ophthalmologist who became a folk hero after sharing information about the virus with friends on social media. Dr. Li, who has reprimanded by police for his actions, later contracted the virus and died last month.

Similarly to Dr. Li, Dr. Ai was rebuked by her hospital’s disciplinary committee for spreading rumors—a response she said she found “stunning.”

Questions around when officials first knew about the virus, and why they weren’t more transparent in the early days of the outbreak, have become increasingly sensitive as Mr. Xi and other Communist Party leaders seek to portray China’s response to the new pathogen as a success.

The magazine declined to comment.

Dr. Ai couldn’t be reached to comment. In a February interview with The Wall Street Journal, Dr. Ai said she had informed the hospital’s leadership and notified the district office of the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention of a possible contagious disease on Dec. 29, after seeing multiple patients with unexplained pneumonia.

Efforts by censors to scrub the internet of Dr. Ai’s account have sparked an outpouring of creativity among China’s internet users and artists. Many set about crafting ever more eye-popping variations of the interview to fool both human monitors and the software that Chinese social-media sites use to zap sensitive content before it spreads widely.

One Beijing-based artist said he had posted or reposted around 100 versions of the interview with Dr. Ai, only to see 80% of them deleted. On Wednesday, the 46-year old, who wanted to be identified only by his surname Wang, came up with a version that sandwiched a partial English-language translation between bar codes. Embedded in the image: a plea for China to introduce laws protecting whistle-blowers.

“This is probably the most important thing for the public to pursue,” Mr. Wang said, referring to rules that would open the door to freer speech.

Censorship algorithms deployed by Chinese social-media operators are trained to flag sensitive images and text alike. A screenshot of a banned article typically doesn’t fool the algorithms. As a result, those looking to evade censors are forced to constantly innovate.

One user rendered the interview in a jaunty handwriting style of late Chinese leader Mao Zedong. It has also been turned into a song and a comicbook strip.

Others got tricky with technology. A public account on China’s popular, do-everything app WeChat required readers to access the interview by sending the words “this essay” in a personal message to administrators. The sender would then receive a link to a blank page with the word “Whistle” at the top. A click in the center of the page would bring up the text of the interview.

Translation has been one of the most popular workarounds. China’s content filters struggle with non-Chinese content, so internet users have busied themselves creating foreign-language versions that others can then copy and put through translation software to convert it back to Chinese.

Aside from conventional spoken languages like Italian and Hebrew, users have posted versions written in Braille, Morse code, emojis and one in sign language. One version claimed to be written in a mixture of Elvish from the novels of J.R.R. Tolkien and Klingon from the TV show “Star Trek.”

Another featured computer code allowing users to download and convert a lightly encrypted version of the interview using a combination of Microsoft Word and Excel.

In recent days, the censorship dodgers have begun describing themselves as taking the baton from the “whistle deliverer.” The term refers to the title of the magazine interview, which was taken from Dr. Ai’s description of her role in warning about the virus.

Though she wasn’t one of the original whistle-blowers, she said, “I’m the one who sent out the whistle.”

Social-media users have applauded efforts to keep the article online.

“I first laughed and then cried when seeing these,” one user posted on WeChat.

The burst of creativity is “a dark comedy caused by an article,” Liao Xinzhong, a Taiwan-based writer, wrote on WeChat. He added he hopes new generations “can freely use the Chinese language without any concerns.”

Pushing beyond text, some users inserted the interview into the openings of Hollywood sci-fi films, including the “Matrix” and “Star Wars.”

The coronavirus has struck a nerve in China because it has affected almost everyone in the country in some way, said King-wa Fu, a censorship expert at the University of Hong Kong. That has inspired a huge surge of protest online.

“This time it’s the whole nation,” he said. “In scale, it’s the largest that I have seen.”"

> ""It is important to keep an eye to ensure we are not missing out on community transmission. The samples we tested in February were evenly distributed.

* The Coronavirus Hotline hung up on me four times today.
* If that's what's happening to others I think people would just say, ""Fuck it then – it's not my problem or fault anymore."" I don't blame them.

* My GP is allowing me to come in because I haven't met the Government criteria. The receptionist sounded hesitant, though.

I am going to lose money on tickets to things (because it's a Government declaration and therefore I don't qualify for a refund... ABC News has more about that).

I'm contemplating chargebacks but I don't think I'd win, since I did knowingly buy them and no one has directed me to self-isolate, so not attending is apparently entirely my choice.

So far I'm going to swallow the cost of:

* My Australian Ballet season tickets.
* My Queensland Ballet season tickets.
* Two cancellation fees on domestic flights.

I have lost a grand. So far.

Latest symptom is that the chores I used to be able to perform one after the other, I now need a little bit of a lie down to recover before feeling able to move onto the next one. So a load of laundry plus hanging it out, I now feel breathless.

But I haven't been overseas or in contact with a confirmed case and so the Government doesn't think I'm at risk."

>What are the symptoms of COVID-19?

>Some people infected with the virus have no symptoms. When the virus does cause symptoms, common ones include low-grade fever, body aches, coughing, nasal congestion, runny nose, and sore throat. However, COVID-19 can occasionally cause more severe symptoms like high fever, severe cough, and shortness of breath, which often indicates pneumonia.

USG Statement on Status of Instruction at Institutions
 For Immediate Release
 March 12, 2020
 Georgia Governor Brian Kemp today announced state agencies, school systems and local communities have been given the flexibility to implement closures.
 Effective Monday, March 16, 2020, all University System of Georgia institutions will temporarily suspend instruction for two weeks to allow time for USG institutions to test their business continuity plans and online instruction modules and for state officials to continue to assess the current situation regarding coronavirus (COVID-19) in Georgia.
 Students who are currently on spring break are strongly encouraged not to return to campus. Students on campus are asked to depart campus by close of business Friday, March 13, 2020, and to remain away from campus until March 29, 2020. At this time, students are not being asked to move out of their dorms for the remainder of the semester. For students who are unable to leave campus, institutions have been asked to develop plans to safely accommodate those students on campus.
 As circumstances change, the USG is providing regular updates to its institutions and the public at http://www.usg.edu/coronavirus."

I go to Walmart afterwards around 10p to replenish my supply of protein bars because I work out. It’s fucking packed. 

While I’m in the pharmacy section, I figured I’d check for hand sanitizer because I work in healthcare and I’m paranoid. Some little bitch runs past me and grabs the last 3. 

Anyway.....I would be more worried about catching something as a Walmart worker than I am as a healthcare worker. They’re keeping all but the most severe cases of Coronavirus out of the hospital. Many hospitals are screening visitors at the door, or banning them altogether. 

Walmart, on the other hand, has had a massive, sustained influx of people. So....if this thing is bigger than we think it is (due to lack of testing) then it will certainly be found at Walmart.

2020-03-13,traviud,Anxiety,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/eupik4/coronavirus_megathread/fkfya0l/,"So...I had a nervous breakdown today. There was about an hour there when I wanted to kill myself. I haven't been sleeping much and I was rejected for a job that I was really counting on. I'm 29 years old, very educated and qualified, but I can't seem to land a teaching job. I was so proud of myself for going to that interview and I thought I did very well, but it just wasn't enough. No idea why. I couldn't handle that news today for myriad reasons. 

My wife called off work so she could look after our daughter. I called the suicide hotline, texted with some friends, called another, called my parents. Everyone I could think of. They all told me that I was valuable, to keep trying, that they loved me and to get some sleep. I'm feeling better now. 

How does this relate to coronavirus?

At some point after the break I had, I realized that I hadn't been thinking about how my throat felt, whether or not I had been coughing, what my temperature was, etc. I stopped caring. I didn't care if I got coronavirus and died. The mind prioritizes challenges by importance and all of a sudden the background noise of my life lifted away. The moment I walked back in my apartment, there was a story about coronavirus on the TV and I cringed. I saw it completely differently, with a kind of anger rather than anxiety. 

It's poison, all of it. I'm not saying that it's not important, that it isn't important to be hygienic for ourselves and others. But goodness fucking gracious this madness needs to stop. Just speaking for myself, this media cycle is like alcohol to an alcoholic and it wasn't until I went up to the ledge that I saw how much it needed to be removed from my life. 

Please, everyone, for your sake, put your phones away for a while and decompress. If you can go outside for a while, do it. Spend time with loved ones and talk about nothing. Sleep. Don't do what I did to get to this point. What I learned from this horrible fucking day is that coronavirus, while legitimately scary, is much scarier if I allow it to be a constant presence in my mind."

2020-03-13,KinnerNevada,Coronavirus,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/fi9fyh/travelers_from_coronavirus_hot_spots_say_they/fkfvx01/,"WASHINGTON — As thousands of Americans flee from Europe and other centers of the coronavirus outbreak, many travelers are reporting no health screenings upon departure and few impediments at U.S. airports beyond a welcome home greeting.

Since January, officers from Customs and Border Protection have been on heightened alert for travelers who could potentially spread the virus. The Department of Homeland Security has told employees to look for visible physical symptoms and search through their travel documents and a federal database that tracks where they came from. Those customs officers will soon have to spot symptoms among a flood of more Americans funneled to 13 designated airports from multiple countries in Europe, an administration official said, after President Trump announced new travel restrictions on the region this week.

But travelers, including some who say they showed visible signs of illness, say screening has been lax. Members of Congress this week grilled senior officials from the Department of Homeland Security over what some described as a porous screening process. And customs officers at airports question how accurately they can pinpoint people with symptoms and what safeguards are being taken to protect their health.

Even top officials at the department acknowledge the task of sealing the United States from the virus is impossible.

“This has never been from Day 1 intended to be a hermetically sealed process,” said Kenneth T. Cuccinelli II, the acting deputy secretary of homeland security. “We are trying to reduce and delay the biggest peak in the virus wave hitting on the United States of America. And all of these steps reduce and delay. They do not stop of the virus.”

“Viruses do not care about boundaries,” he said.

Maggie McDow, 46, said she had swollen glands when she landed at Dulles International Airport outside Washington, one of the airports where travelers who have recently been in China or Iran are being funneled. Ms. McDow had flown from London, but before that, she had stopped in South Korea, a coronavirus hot spot.

Ms. McDow said she heard plenty of instructions from airport officials for those feeling ill in airports abroad. But when she reached the United States, she said, “There was none of that.” A customs officer stamped her passport, and she was on her way.

Get an informed guide to the global outbreak with our daily coronavirus newsletter.
“No one asked where I had traveled. I guess they just assumed we all were just coming from London and so no big deal,” Ms. McDow wrote in an email because she was too sick to speak on the phone and has yet to be tested for the coronavirus.
The Trump administration has barred entry to foreigners who in the past 14 days have visited China, Iran, and beginning at 11:59 p.m. Friday, 26 countries in the European Union. The administration has also told customs officers to use the federal travel database, documents and interviews with travelers to determine who to refer to a health screening at the airport. Officers are also required to refer those with symptoms coming from South Korea or Italy to be screened by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, according to Stephanie Malin, a spokeswoman for Customs and Border Protection.

Ms. Malin said that as of March 4, more than 63,000 travelers at airports, seaports and the land border had been referred by a Customs and Border Protection officer for a health screening. Mr. Cuccinelli said last week at a Senate homeland security hearing that the screenings had been successful at slowing the outbreak.

“It bought us time,” Mr. Cuccinelli said.

In addition to barring foreigners from 26 European countries, President Trump’s new travel restrictions will funnel Americans to designated airports in New York City, Chicago, San Francisco, Seattle, Honolulu, Los Angeles, Atlanta, Virginia, Detroit, Dallas, Newark, Boston and Miami. The travelers will be subjected to enhanced health screenings, according to a federal register notice published on Friday.

The crush of Americans returning from Europe will make those screenings that much harder.

Tony Reardon, the president of the National Treasury Employees Union, which represents officers from the section of Customs and Border Protection that conducts screening at airports in the United States, said officers were concerned about travelers not being truthful, or not knowing, about their symptoms.

“They are worried about the imprecise distinctions on when travelers may be contagious,” Mr. Reardon said. “They are also worried about whether all passengers who are at risk based on their travel history are being properly flagged for screening.”

Senior officials with Customs and Border Protection, speaking to reporters on Friday on a conference call, highlighted the medical safeguards enforced for its workers. The officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the agency had medical officials ready to answer officers’ questions and protective equipment such as masks for employees. The agency is also using surveillance video to backtrack the movements of any traveler who passed through an airport and later developed symptoms of the coronavirus to determine if any officers were exposed.

The officials declined to provide the number of employees who have been tested or confirmed to have the disease.
Three security screeners with the Transportation Security Administration at a Northern California airport have tested positive for the coronavirus, the agency said this week. Two medical contractors employed by the Homeland Security Department also learned last week that they had the virus. The department closed a field office in Washington State for two weeks this month after an employee contracted the disease.

“They are caught in the middle,” said Gil Kerlikowske, the former commissioner of Customs and Border Protection, said of officers at the agency. “You’re depending on them to do a host of things.”

He said that if travelers returned without being screened, it was because federal agencies had given customs officers vague instructions.

Lawmakers have also shared those concerns.

Senator Richard J. Durbin, Democrat of Illinois, sent a letter to the C.D.C. demanding it clarify what airport screening was being given to travelers coming from South Korea and Italy. He highlighted two passengers returning from Italy who had not been screened in Chicago but later tested positive for the coronavirus.

William Yates, 28, said that did not happen to him. He did not undergo any medical screening before he left Rome, with a layover in London, or before boarding his flight from London to Phoenix. While he experienced no symptoms, he believed he might be stopped since he visited Emilia-Romagna, a region in Italy where provinces have been locked down because of the outbreak.

When he arrived in Phoenix, he was asked only if he had visited Milan.

“‘Cool, welcome back.’ And that was it,” Mr. Yates said.

He is currently working from home as a precaution. A supervisor in an emergency room, Mr. Yates did not want to risk spreading any illness to other patients."

Assuming you live from coronavirus, the worst that would happen to you is lung tissue damage that would reduce your overall ability to breathe. After all, polio would only destroy your spinal cord, paralyzing you, and they didn't vaccinate for that. In comparison, it seems quite benign."

""The  system is not really geared to what we need right now,"" Dr. Anthony  Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious  Diseases, said in a House hearing about coronavirus test kits in the  United States, which were initially [dogged ](https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/after-missteps-cdc-says-its-coronavirus-test-kit-ready-primetime-n1145206)by technical glitches. ""That is a failing. Let's admit it.""

""The idea of anybody getting it easily the way people in other countries  are doing it, we're not set up for that,"" Fauci told Wasserman Schultz.  ""Do I think we should be? Yes. But we're not.""

...

The question came a week after a nurse exposed to the virus in northern California said in a [statement ](https://act.nationalnursesunited.org/page/-/files/graphics/NU-Quarantine-RN-press-conf-statement.pdf)through National Nurses United that despite having symptoms, the CDC would not test her.

""They  said they would not test me because if I were wearing the recommended  protective equipment, then I wouldn't have the coronavirus. What kind of  science-based answer is that?"" the nurse said."

Even if you plan to work in Big Law for 5 years, that's five years of saving a Big Law salary, vs paying down ~$200k in debt.

Also, can you know for certain that you'll be a Resident Tutor? My understanding is that those positions are pretty competitive. Plus, as someone else who wants to clerk, I'm hesitant about the potential time commitment—which they note doesn't lessen when you are busier.

* [The president fought testing](https://twitter.com/nprfreshair/status/1238186469690429440) early on in order to boost his electoral chances by keeping confirmed cases low.
* He [didn't accept WHO tests](https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/06/coronavirus-testing-failure-123166) that were ready in January.
* The CDC [bungled its own tests](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/02/health/coronavirus-testing-cdc.html).
* The FDA [didn't allow hospitals](https://mobile.twitter.com/ScottGottliebMD/status/1224042220665307137) to use their own homespun tests.
* He's [actively trying to halt the import of critical medical supplies](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/11/business/economy/coronavirus-china-trump-drugs.html) via executive order.
* He's also [forbidding Medicaid funds from being used](https://www.latimes.com/politics/story/2020-03-13/trump-administration-blocks-states-use-medicaid-respond-coronavirus-crisis) to help with COVID treatment.
* Due to the administration's underfunding of public health organizations, the CDC had to [cut its epidemic prevention services by 80%](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/to-your-health/wp/2018/02/01/cdc-to-cut-by-80-percent-efforts-to-prevent-global-disease-outbreak/).
* He's [strangled honest medical communications with the public](https://www.businessinsider.com/trump-response-coronavirus-mimics-authoritarian-regimes-2020-2), to the point of [not allowing the CDC to tell vulnerable populations](https://apnews.com/921ad7f1f08d7634bf681ba785faf269?utm_medium=AP&utm_source=Twitter&utm_campaign=SocialFlow) about what behavior is risky for them and contradicting public health officials by [continually insisting](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/05/us/politics/trump-coronavirus-fact-check.html) ([and sending others to insist](https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/coronavirus-economic-market-outlook-us-kudlow-azar-cdc-white-house-2020-2-1028937843)) that the US is prepared and the disease is contained, when it is not.
* [The US is least prepared to judge its level of infection](https://www.vox.com/science-and-health/2020/3/12/21175034/coronavirus-covid-19-testing-usa) out of all countries significantly impacted.
* Globally, we're probably looking at [40-70% of all people infected](https://thehill.com/changing-america/well-being/prevention-cures/482794-officials-say-the-cdc-is-preparing-for) with COVID. Because we're reacting so slowly, we're probably going to be looking at the higher end for a Western country. Germany expects between [60-70% infected](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/03/11/angela-merkel-most-people-will-get-the-coronavirus.html).
* We also currently (3/11/2020) have a [mortality rate for confirmed cases of 7%](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2020/01/22/mapping-spread-new-coronavirus/?arc404=true) in the US, which will likely get worse when hospitals are overrun with cases (this data is pretty fuzzy though, due to both a lack of testing and a lack of transparency; globally it's around 3%).

That's not even the issue here though. The issue is that hospitals simply can't handle the workload, which results in a lot of deaths not just from coronavirus, but also other completely unrelated conditions like heart attacks. This isn't reflected in the statistic"
2020-03-13,EnriqueMuller,LiverpoolFC,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/LiverpoolFC/comments/fi8cqy/liverpool_set_to_be_awarded_premier_league_title/fkfqxvk/,"Liverpool are still likely to be crowned Premier League champions, even if the coronavirus crisis causes the season to be abandoned amid mounting fears it would be ­ impossible to complete it this summer.

As revealed by Telegraph Sport last month, there is no regulation governing what happens if the 2019-20 campaign is curtailed. But a senior club executive revealed on Friday night that there was little ­opposition to awarding Jurgen Klopp’s men their first English title for 30 years following what threatened to be the longest suspension of the professional game since the Second World War.

Leaders Liverpool are 25 points clear of second-placed Manchester City and two more victories for the Anfield club will give them the title. Such is the gap that there is no appetite among their rivals to deny them the crown.

The coronavirus hiatus is in danger of plunging football in England into anarchy, with governing bodies and clubs desperately trying to devise ways to avoid the unprecedented meltdown that could ensue if Government projections over the spread of the deadly disease prove correct.

On a day when more sport fell by the wayside, including the London Marathon, the Masters, Wales’s Six Nations match with Scotland, England’s cricket tour of Sri Lanka, the start of the Formula One season, and the Giro d’Italia, one senior figure at a Premier League team told *Telegraph Sport*: “There is so much more at stake. There is a focus on whether Liverpool will be champions, but that will be an irrelevance in the scheme of things. There is an intent we will recommence, but will that be possible?”

The Premier League had devised a plan in which the season would finish on schedule provided it resumed on April 3. That was the date to which it, the English Football League and Football Association agreed to suspend the men’s and women’s professional game following crisis talks on Friday. But with the virus forcing seven Premier League clubs yesterday to put players into isolation and the disease not forecast to peak until May or June, an April resumption appeared optimistic in the extreme.

FA chairman Greg Clarke told Premier League clubs it was not “feasible” to expect their remaining matches to be played, while another senior figure told *Telegraph Sport*: “You tell me whether you think there’s the remotest possibility that anything in the science is going to tell us that it’s going to be safer to play on April 3 than now.”

This summer’s European Championship [is expected to be postponed at an emergency meeting of European football stakeholders on Tuesday](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/football/2020/03/12/euro-2020-verge-postponed-2021-cancelled-altogether-due-coronavirus/) in order to allow the club season to continue into June and July – and potentially even beyond.

The same senior figure raised the prospect of the calendar being ­redrawn to dovetail with the next World Cup in Qatar, the switch of which to the winter of 2022 had ­already been accommodated by the game.

“One scenario could be that you just work backwards from it and you say, ‘Why don’t we have a calendar season in 2022 and a calendar season in 2021 and we play the rest of this season in October?’” he said.

But many players will be out of contract on June 30 and will also have lost match fitness, raising major questions about the integrity of competitions.

Calling a halt to the season would be no less chaotic. That has resulted in discussions taking place inside some Premier League teams over proposals that could be put forward if the season could not be played to a conclusion. One would be to void the season, but there is an acceptance that would cause many of its own problems with Liverpool so close to winning the ­title.

There would also be the issues of relegation and promotion from the Championship, together with Champions League qualification, which carry huge financial implications for the clubs involved.

One proposal that could be made would be for the top two in the Championship, currently Leeds and West Brom, to be promoted and for 22 teams to compete in next season’s Premier League. The EFL Cup would be postponed for one year to allow extra space in the fixture list and five clubs, instead of three, would be relegated at the end of the season.

One suggestion regarding Champions League qualification would be to allow the teams who qualified for this season’s tournament to keep their places next season and then ­enter any additional sides currently in qualification positions into an ­expanded qualifying phase.

That would mean third-placed Leicester going into a qualifying round for the Champions League, with Liverpool, Manchester City – subject to the Court of Arbitration for Sport hearing – Chelsea and Tottenham holding on to their places in the tournament. But Manchester United, Wolves and Sheffield United, who are all above seventh-placed Spurs, would no doubt object to this.

Christian Purslow, the Aston Villa chief executive, attended Friday's emergency meeting of the  Premier League. Asked if he thought the current season will be completed, he ­replied: “We have no idea. Let’s hope so.”

Failure to do so would in turn jeopardise billions of pounds in television money, with Premier League chief executive Richard Masters having already stressed to clubs in an email on Thursday night that “contractual commitments” needed to be taken into consideration.

As revealed by Telegraph Sport, it would also risk sending EFL clubs – who depend on match-day ­revenue – out of business. That might be one reason why the non-League game did not follow the lead of its professional counterpart yesterday by calling off matches."

I want to preface this by I don’t know if these figures are true or will ever become true. There is some research that says over 70% of the world population will contract this coronavirus. 7 billion people times 70% equals 4.9 billion people. If we have a 3% mortality rate, That means that 147 million people will die from this. again, I have no clue if anywhere close to 70% of the world population will get this. But that would be fucking crazy if that happened."
