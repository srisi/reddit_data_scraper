2020-01-25,Severelyimpared,WuhanVirus,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/WuhanVirus/comments/etj066/has_anyone_gotten_better/ffj07yd/,"My best guess is around 10-20%. It could even be a bit higher because we would be comparing deaths to people who are going to survive.

Also, they've made public statistics like most of the deaths are people over 60 and I think nobody under 30 has died yet. Given China's population control measures, they have a bit of a funky population distribution that weighs heavily to older people, which may result in a much higher fatality rate than if some other country had this outbreak.

Wuhan Coronavirus is basically in-line with being comparable to MERS and SARS coronaviruses. Elderly people seem to be particularly vulnerable which is always the case wether it's the flu, ebola, or this. I think the age demographics of the infected will determine the overall fatality rate."

 How to protect yourself

There are currently no vaccines available to protect you against human coronavirus infection. You may be able to reduce your risk of infection by doing the following

* wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds
* avoid touching your eyes, nose, or mouth with unwashed hands
* avoid close contact with people who are sick

 How to protect others

If you have cold-like symptoms, you can help protect others by doing the following

* stay home while you are sick
* avoid close contact with others
* cover your mouth and nose with a tissue when you cough or sneeze, then throw the tissue in the trash and wash your hands
* clean and disinfect objects and surfaces

## Treatment

There are no specific treatments for illnesses caused by human coronaviruses. Most people with common human coronavirus illness will recover on their own. However, you can do some things to relieve your symptoms

* take pain and fever medications (Caution: do not give Aspirin to children)
* use a room humidifier or take a hot shower to help ease a sore throat and cough

If you are mildly sick, you should

* drink plenty of liquids
* stay home and rest

If you are concerned about your symptoms, you should see your healthcare provider."

While they have some things in common, there are many kinds. This is (supposedly) a newer variation. The patent is not related to the current outbreak. 

The current virus is not as deadly as SARS, but spreads faster, so it’s about on par with that epidemic as far as we current know."

The global health community is especially concerned regarding coronaviruses because their clinical manifestations during infection are similar to other respiratory infections (hard to spot). Further, SARS and MERS have high mortality rates of 10% and 34.5%, respectively. Right now, 2019-nCoV has approximately (and it’s too early to tell for certain) a mortality rate of 4%. Comparatively, Spanish Flu is predicted to have a mortality rate of 10%-20%. 

Not only is coronavirus infection hard to differentiate symptomatically from influenza infection, but they both have the potential to rapidly mutate. We don’t have any antivirals or vaccines for coronaviruses that are licensed by the FDA. This is a significant difference. The only choice is to prevent it through quarantine (people who may have been exposed), isolation (people who are infected), hand washing and masks.

Lastly, we have very little adaptive immunity against coronaviruses. 4 of 7 coronavirus strains cause the common cold, so we may have cross-protective immunity from them; however, most of our immune systems have never encountered the other 3 virus strains (SARS, MERS, 2019-nCoV) and their variants. We likely must rely on innate immunity and the few antibodies that just happen to bind to coronavirus components when we encounter this novel strain."

On the other hand I do sometimes worry but just like with every other thing that goes around I take precautions. I stay away from sick people if possible and stay away from healthy folks if I'm the one that's sick, I disinfect my space at work, keep a tight lock on hygiene, etc.

>Any one have a more reasonable outlook?

Rely on rapid global response. Health organizations and governments all over the world are doing what they can to prevent a full-blown pandemic. As long as you're not traveling (and namely to China) and practice good hygiene/cleanliness you may be fine.  Say you do get sick though, if you're otherwise healthy and young you'll likely have symptoms reminiscent of a bad cold. The death rate seems to be pretty low (from what I've read?) so that's out of the worry, again, unless you're old and have existing health problems.

To put it in perspective, the Swine Flu (2009), Polio (2014), Ebola (2014), Zika (2016) and Kivu Ebola (2018-2020) were all declared global emergencies. Currently the 2019 nCoV/Coronavirus is not."

This will blow over, just as the news about WWIII blew over within a few weeks. Remember that big scare? The only reason why people globally care so much is because it began in China, and for some reason anything involving China makes news at the speed of light. If you live outside of China, you've seriously got at least 50 other diseases to worry about before ever even considering Corona.

And if this does become a global outbreak, statistically YOU ARE NOT GOING TO DIE! Think about it, there are nearly 8 billion people on Earth. You will be fine.

""Even if 100,000 died, that is less than 1%"".. that is a poor way to look at it unless you are trying to spread misinformation.

 If 100k people suddenly died due to one new cause even in a country as large as the US (much less a city), that is a HUGE deal. Enough to cause the stock markets to crash and for new policies to be implemented.  You need to think of this as.. how infective is it? If one person walks into a crowded room, how many people will get infected? If those who get infected, how sick will most get? How many will get very sick and or die?  

If 100k die, how many got infected? If there is a 2% death rate (ie spanish flu) that means 5 million people contracted the disease. That is 5M people that may not be able to work, may not earn a salary, cannot sell you groceries, cannot provide fire or police protection, cannot teach your kids, cannot take care of those 5M other sick people... this multiplies to millions of dollars of commerce and economic activity. If 2% die, maybe 10% get very sick.. sick enough to be hospitalized. For Wuhan there are around 6.4 hospital beds for each 1k people. That means there are roughly 70k beds available, a well run hospital may run at 90% occupancy leaving 7k beds available.  In the above example, if 5M people get sick and only 10% are sick enough to be hospitalized that means you have 500k people that need hospital beds. That displaces all the routine heart attacks, strokes, etc that happen. This was using a 2% death rate, the previous two severe coronavirus outbreaks (SARS and MERS) had mortality rates running in the 10-35% range.

So you can see even if you lower that figure by a factor of 100, it is a big deal."

Just because they were studying coronaviruses, which would not be surprising since it's a virus research facility, does not mean that they were studying THE coronavirus currently spreading. Also, how do you know they are underreporting numbers? Just because someone is sick doesn't mean they have the coronavirus. They have to take samples and sequence the virus's RNA before confirming the patient has the virus. This takes days, and that time only increases as more samples have to be processed. They could easily be reporting the correct number of confirmed cases. If you don't have a real source for your claims, you should just shut the fuck up."

This coronavirus is *not* hemorrhagic, which means it does not cause bleeding. Several that you've linked to show bloodied people, so these are not individuals affected by this virus.

Several of the videos are also old. They're from previous outbreaks.

Several of the videos show people passing out in the street. This is also not consistent with this coronavirus.

Any current-day video posted should - generally speaking - be high quality due to the ubiquity of HD cameras on phones in China. The only exception to this is when a video was live-streamed and was heavily compressed to accommodate network congestion.

The Chinese often wear masks in public due to air quality and public health concerns. The presence of masks on people in video is not evidence of any link to coronavirus."

Initial symptoms are flu-like and may include fever, muscle pain, lethargy symptoms, cough, sore throat, and other nonspecific symptoms.

The symptom common to all patients: fever above 38 °C (100 °F). This may eventually lead to shortness of breath and pneumonia — either direct viral pneumonia or secondary bacterial pneumonia.

Like SARS, the average incubation period for the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) is four–six days, though it could be as short as 1 day or as long as 14 days.""

Read’s group estimates that only about 5.1 percent of cases in Wuhan have been identified. The researchers reported the preliminary results January 24 at medRxiv.org.

>That’s probably not because the Chinese government is covering up how bad the outbreak is, Majumder says. Many people may have had only mild symptoms or none at all. Those people probably wouldn’t go to the doctor and get tested for the virus.

>Majumder and Harvard colleague Kenneth Mandl used a different method to calculate R0 for the new virus, estimating based on cases reported as of January 22 that its transmissibility falls from 2.0 to 3.3. Their results were posted to SSRN on January 23.

>Meanwhile, Christian Althaus and Julien Riou, both of the University of Bern in Switzerland, posted data to Github supporting their calculation that the new virus’s infectivity is between 1.4 and 3.8. Each of those calculations was arrived at using different methods. While they are slightly different, they overlap, and Majumder says she’s reassured that the numbers are similar.

* the ""common"" flu virus kills a hell of a lot more people, year-on-year, and yet we don't have 24-hour news bulletins about _that_
* the ""common"" flu virus is protected against in the exact same way as you would this one, and yet we don't go around wearing face masks all year long (even if we technically should!)
* if people are dying _in Wuhan_, then they're obviously in Wuhan, _and not anywhere else_
* the Chinese government already has locked-down Wuhan, and the local government has managed to rule-out the people suspected of having it that were in-country, and we've already sent back people who came from Wuhan recently
* SARS did kill a bunch of people, but the fact that we can look back on it now and _talk about SARS in the past tense_ essentially confirms that _extant disease control measures work even across international boundaries_, and not every new virus has to be treated as if it was the 2011 Contagion movie

To be fair, there does need to be _some_ awareness of a viral outbreak so that disease control measures are triggered to begin with, but as the article suggests, a reporter going on-air with a face-mask on is just being overly dramatic, and people spreading rumors that [it's some kind of ""bio-weapon""](https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/escjsc/_/ff93h2c) or that its origin comes from people eating strange animals is just a platform for elevating anti-Chinese chauvinism.

To put it another way, if the Coronavirus really is as bad as the media would like for us to believe, __then all that authoritarianism we decry the PRC for practicing is exactly the kind of thing you want to have on-hand when you're dealing with a deadly viral outbreak__."

Whether the outbreak will continue to spread at this rate depends on the effectiveness of control measures, the scientists who conducted the studies said. But to be able to contain the epidemic and turn the tide of infections, control measures would have to halt transmission in at least 60 per cent of cases. 


The death toll from the coronavirus outbreak jumped to 56 on Sunday (Jan 26), with close to 2,000 people infected worldwide - the vast majority in China.

""It is unclear at the current time whether this outbreak can be contained within China,"" said Neil Ferguson, an infectious disease specialist at Imperial College London who co-led one of the studies.


Ferguson's team suggest as many as 4,000 people in Wuhan were already infected by Jan 18 and that on average each case was infecting two or three others.


A second study by researchers at Britain's Lancaster University also calculated the contagion rate at 2.5 new people on average being infected by each person already infected.


""Should the epidemic continue unabated in Wuhan, we predict (it) will be substantially larger by Feb. 4,"" the scientists wrote.


They estimated that the central Chinese city of Wuhan where the outbreak began in December will alone have around 190,000 cases of infection by Feb 4, and that ""infection will be established in other Chinese cities, and importations to other countries will be more frequent.""


Raina MacIntyre, head of the Biosecurity Research Program at the Kirby Institute, at the University of New South Wales in Australia, said on Saturday that it is highly concerning that in recent days the infection has become widespread.


Australia, a popular destination for Chinese visitors, confirmed its first four cases of the virus in travellers from China, all of whom had been to Wuhan."

I'm worried about contagiousness **combined** with the deadliness. 

I saw a news article and listened to an alleged phone call by a nurse from China claiming that doctors there are estimating 100,000ish people to be infected.

Let's say that's sensationalized and it's half that - 50,000. We're still looking at 50,000 people infected in 6 weeks. 8,300 people per week. If it really is 100,000 people, that's 16 and a half thousand people. Per week. Infections are being reported in Nepal, Vietnam, two states in the USA, South Korea, Macau, Japan, Taiwan, Singapore, Malaysia, France, Australia, Honk Kong, and Thailand. 

Back to the numbers though. 16,500(or 8300) people per week in China. This tells me(I'M NOT A DOCTOR) one of two things - either China is just shitty and unsanitary and packed as hell, which is super likely(at least I hope it's more likely than #2.)

\#2 is that it's airborne. If it's airborne, I'm **really** worried, at least for the people of China. Slightly worried for us here.

All we can really do is sit back and watch. Stock up on food/water, N95 respirators(better than nothing) and if you're in the USA, a gun or two probably wouldn't hurt. Keep your eyes on the news, and be ready to leave."

The current estimates for this season in the US are ~15,000,000 infected with ~8,000 deaths. Compare this to a novel coronavirus, which is already a fairly rare type of outbreak, of which very little is known about with no current vaccine that is highly contagious and often asymptomatic.

2020-01-25,Kesuke,ukpolitics,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/ukpolitics/comments/ettiqg/what_are_your_thoughts_on_the_governments/ffih9ht/,"I think the government here is doing everything it realistically can. There are 1.3 billion Chinese people... 1 in every 7 people is Chinese. To make matters worse, millions of Chinese people are travelling around the world to spend the Chinese New Year (today) with their families - and we know that population movements are associated with the spread of infection.

I'll preface this by saying I work in the NHS and it is an area I have some familiarity with. It's important to understand what ""screening"" is and what it isn't. Screening is not a diagnostic test - screening is just a way of identifying 'high risk' individuals. Screening doesn't even necessarily need to involve any testing - it could be done simply by questionairre. Frankly, anyone arriving in the UK from Wuhan or the other affected regions is de facto high risk. 

There is no robust ""*screening test*"" for Coronavirus. There is a comprehensive diagnostic test (Coronvirus RT-PCR assay) which is extremely expensive and time consuming - requiring complex laboratory equiptment and reagents that are not in abudnant supply. In a hurry the test can be done in about half a day - but it wouldn't be feasible (from a cost or practical point of view) to test every person coming from China. When you hear about ""*screening*"" in some countries, all they are doing is just taking peoples temperatures in the airport - if someone has a fever then they suggest that they ask them some questions and if relevant suggest that they go to a hospital. But it's also late January in Europe... so this is peak flu season. Everyone and their dog has a cold at the moment, so lots of people are running temperatures with snotty noses and a cough... so it isn't a very useful screening test. 

Basically the government is doing everything it reasonably can. This is a highly contagious coronavirus by all accounts so if it is going to come to the UK, then there is nothing we can realistically do to stop it. Its a virus so the treatment options are really limited to just providing supportive care, which we already have the facilities to do. 

Essentially if this is anything like the 1918 Spanish Flu outbreak, SARS or MERS then all we can really do is keep our fingers crossed, try to make sure the public are kept informed of when they should (AND SHOULDN'T) be going to hospital, and doing what we can to put in place contingency planning in the event this turns into a global pandemic (i.e. cancelling elective operations, opening emergency wards, increasing staffing levels, providing protective equiptment to staff).

\*\*TL;DR: From the perspective of someone in the NHS, I think the government approach has been reasonable and they are doing pretty much all that they reasonably can. This isn't the fault of our government and if it spreads to the UK (which it probably will) then we will just have to cross that bridge when we get to it\*\*"

H1N1 wasn’t nearly as lethal as what we’ve seen from this coronavirus so far (I ended up being similar to rates from seasonal flu, which is about 100X less than what they’re seeing from this virus). It took several months for an H1N1 vaccine to become publicly available, and that’s with all of the know-how and infrastructure that we already have for churning out new flu vaccines on a seasonal schedule. There are currently no human coronavirus vaccines (in spite of efforts to develop vaccines against SARS and MERS), so it’s not like we have an easy road map to follow to get this done in a few months. 

And it is true that this coronavirus is less lethal so far than SARS or MERs, but it also seems to be more transmissible. The long incubation time seems to be playing a role here. We’re only a few weeks into the outbreak and we already have more confirmed cases in the US than we ever had for MERs. 

I get that people are over all of the “end of the world” histrionics that seem to go along with every news story. But this is something that public health officials need to be taking very seriously, and there’s no getting around the fact that in order to keep this virus under control the public needs to be aware of the outbreak and what areas are affected. Otherwise you’ll just have clueless people spreading the infection because they think they just have a little cold."

Data is still scarce, but right now young, healthy people aren't dying. It's mostly older men and people who are already sick. So it's possible (but statistically incredibly unprobable) that, you could get both the flu and coronavirus at the same time, which would increase your chances of dying due to complications.

Get the flu shot anyways, dude. I actually thought it was a really good one this year! I didn't get any flu (and ngl my immune system isn't the best in the world) nor did any of my friends or family.

# Wuhan novel coronavirus

Wuhan novel coronavirus (WN-CoV) is a new respiratory illness that has not previously been seen in humans.

The risk of getting the illness in the UK is low.

## Advice to travellers going to Wuhan, China

You should avoid all but essential travel to Wuhan, Hubei province, China.

If you are travelling to the area, you should:

* wash your hands regularly with soap and water
* avoid visiting animal and bird markets
* avoid contact with anyone who is ill with a cough or difficulty breathing

## Advice to travellers returning from Wuhan, China

If you have travelled to Wuhan City in China in the last 2 weeks and feel unwell, call NHS 111 for advice.

Do not go straight to a doctor's surgery or hospital.

## What is the risk of catching Wuhan novel coronavirus in the UK?

If there is a case in the UK, health professionals will aim to contact anyone who has been in close contact with the infected person.

If you have not been contacted, be reassured you are extremely unlikely to catch Wuhan novel coronavirus.

## Symptoms of Wuhan coronavirus

Symptoms usually include:

* feeling tired
* difficulty breathing
* a high temperature
* a cough

## How is Wuhan novel coronavirus spread between people?

Because it's a new illness, we do not know exactly how Wuhan novel coronavirus spreads from person to person, but similar viruses spread by cough droplets.

## Treatment for Wuhan novel coronavirus

There is no specific treatment for Wuhan novel coronavirus. Treatment aims to relieve the symptoms.

I think most Australians would think you were weird if you were not critical. Well unless one is Chinese. There's a legitimate infiltration of the CCP into local Chinese communities to the point that almost every single Chinese Australian  you'll meet will have a single opinion on matters relating to CHina. Almost always positive and the narrative the CCP wants. To the point that they'll question the validity of ABC reporting in favour of CCP propaganda (like the scale of the coronavirus outbreak being small). I question the loyalty of those brainwashed people who enjoy Australian citizenship and residency but consume and propagate CCP propaganda."

It's no wonder when you have some of the most unhealthy air pollution on Earth in China, that many are becoming sickened by such toxicity and developing viruses to cleanse their overburdened and toxic bodies. The fearmongering must stop, or at the very least, no one should pay any attention to their scare tactics. If they do, they will attempt the same procedures here if they see they can lasso enough people into their fear brigade. The USA, along with China, is attempting another fiasco and virus scam, exactly as they did with Swine flu and the Ebola scare.

When you have a population in fear, anything and everything becomes connected somehow to the fear it is associated with. That does not prove correlation or that such fear is warranted. Don't be wooed by the fact everyone is wearing masks and body gear. They wear masks all the time there anyway because they fall for the myth that viruses are contagious hook, line, and sinker. This is typical of Chinese and other Asiatic countries. They are merely carrying out the protocols they have been taught in medical school. To the average viewer, this makes them appear more legitimate as if an outbreak is on the precipice.

There are only 2 ways to get the coronavirus. Either by living in a place like China and being exposed to extremely polluted air and developing a respiratory virus in your own body (coronavirus SARS, etc.), or being injected (vaccinated) and getting sick.

* Case is a man in his 50s.
* Recently travelled to Wuhan, became quite ill one day after returning (arrived Jan 22). Family called 911 to take him to hospital. Did not arrive via direct flight (no such flights exists between Toronto and Wuhan. Details still forecoming, but health official has said during questions that the flight path is Wuhan -> Guangzhou -> Toronto)
* Admitted to Toronto Sunnybrook Hospital on Jan 23. In isolation ward. Currently in stable condition.
* Lab results from Ontario have come back ""presumptive positive"". **Update:** Chief Medical Officer Dr. David Williams has said 95% sure that it is positive.
* Health officials say all containment and health safety procedures have been followed. Risk to Ontarians remains low. Public health is reviewing individual and his whereabouts. Family is now in isolation. Says did he not spend much time in the city and stayed mostly at home.
* Investigation on details still ongoing, including complete flight and patient history.
* Still ascertaining if patient was infectious during flight. Will be identifying and tracking individuals on flight, especially those within 3 rows of patient on flight. Still preliminary information, not enough to share. All systems of public health working in tandem to deal with this case as we speak.
* Annoucement of website to track Wuhan virus cases and safety instructions: [ontario.ca/coronavirus](https://ontario.ca/coronavirus)

**Update:** Sunnybrook Director of Infection Prevention (sic, didn't catch the title properly) has said patient was identified immediately as a suspicious case. Travel history immediately collected. Approriate precautions followed on arrival, includes proper use of protective equipment and immediate admission to isolation ward with negative air pressure. Direct transport from home to hospital. Paramedics followed full precautions.

Also, the CDC only reports confimed cases of Influenza so Rhinovirus is irrelevant in your first paragraph. 

I agree with the rest of your post though, it is hard to say how deadly this coronavirus will be but I think it will not so bad similar to MERS. Definitely, still worrisome as the virus could still adapt to humans like has happened in the past for H5N1, SARS and Ebola."

That's a common pattern with zoonotic diseases, they are unlikely to be well adapted to humans since they after all came from a unrelated animal species.

The screening is typically done on the jet bridge leading out of the aircraft, using thermal imaging to detect passengers with a fever. Those then get pulled aside and taken for secondary examination, which may be done at the airport clinic or at a hospital depending on the facilities available.

Of course the method is not perfect because infected people could be asymptomatic (especially at the very early stages of the infection), or have taken antipyretic drugs to bring the fever down temporarily, so you get false negatives.

You also get false positives because you’ll end up selecting people with fever not caused by the coronavirus (e.g. common flu, etc)."

The coronavirus is child’s play compared to Ebola, as far as we know it isn’t even as deadly as SARS was, the mortality rate is also very inflated at the moment because hospitals in China are overwhelmed by panicking patients, most of them probably contract the virus in the hospitals themselves ironically, if this outbreak happened in a Western country we would be looking at it like a bad flu instead of Ebola."

So if you're telling me CoronaVirus, specifically, can survive for 1.5 weeks to a month, in constantly changing temperatures/locations, on the surface of carton and plastic. Then maybe you're right, but that's not what you're saying. You're talking about viruses in a generic matter as if they are all the same.

This conspiracy game does not take you anywhere, and would only trap you inside a hole that is impossible to climb out of. Of course, take the Chinese gov't with a grain of salt, but these void speculations soothe no pain.

Bats are a major coronavirus carrier so it would be a top contestant for such research, and Wuhan's virus lab is the largest in China and among the top-funded in the world so it would not be strange for a Chinese scientist who wants to work back home to choose that facility. It is literally a ""State Key Lab,"" he would work there just like how American physicists would like to use facilities in the National Lab System like the Argonne or Fermilab.

Wuhan is a key city in the Chinese economy with 11.6M people living according to gov't data, as well as undocumented resident workers at least in hundreds of thousands if not 1M. This city also has insufficient medical infrastructure and standards in procedures. It is more likely for this disease to start in the wildlife and spread to the urban population than to leak from a highly secure lab.

I was in high school when the swine flu panic hit, and I remember it being a big thing in Australia. Schools and public buildings were closed, people were getting tested, the government was on alert, it was super serious. I also remember everyone making the point that swine flu wasn't really vastly more dangerous than the regular flu season and that people just needed to calm down. Obviously it ended up being not too serious.

One of my teachers had a theory that the government knew from the start that it wasn't likely to be serious, but since the media had hyped it so much they saw it as a rare chance to do a proper test rehearsal of a full-scale pandemic response, and put everything in motion just to be sure they were ready in case a real pandemic hit. The situation in China right now reminds me a lot of that. Of course, Xi Jinping practicing deploying army units and locking down cities may be a rehearsal for something, but it might not necessarily be a rehearsal for a medical emergency."

You’ve seen the videos of them fumigating the streets right? That’s not going to decontaminate anything especially if it’s spread through the air. That was more likely an attempt to kill something- rats? Fleas? 

It is highly likely Lyme disease is a bio weapon that escaped a lab in the USA. It spread along the migratory bird paths. 

The lab in Wuhan was a source of concern in 2017, with experts fearing diseases could accidentally escape into a dense population.

Is hard to try to image and fear it is in front of me. Also, I'm 22, healthy, live in Rio de Janeiro far from big centers and also I work at home office (programmer), so it's very unlikely I'll get that illness, I haven't got a cold for years.

But if it comes to Brazil, I'm sure poor people will die, because some public hospitals are crowded and with few supplies even without coronavirus and also we don't have the ability of creating 2 huge hospitals within days nor have a lot of quarantine rooms here, that would be a mess since my country is huge and borders like 15 different countries, including Venezuela where people are starving and fleeing to Brazil because of a communist dictator.

So, I'm not worried yet. But if someone gets infected in Brazil before they create an immunity vaccine, I'll be concerned since a lot of people will die and the country will spend a lot of money when it's the last thing we need since we are struggling to create laws to cut costs and whatnot after a big corruption scandal."

1) You're in line for these masks. Macau, Hong Kong, and Mainland Government are speaking with suppliers directly for their city. My guess is suppliers would prioritize their orders as it's expected to be in the millions
2) Countries like Japan and Taiwan are prohibiting exports of these masks to preserve for their country incase of an outbreak. This means more businesses contacting Chinese suppliers
3) No one really knows how long this coronavirus would last. You should weigh in how long it would take you to sell these masks. If it lasts for more weeks / months, you're good, however IF somehow it's contained within weeks, you're stuck with the containers. These masks are only hot demand due to the epidemic.

No, the Wuhan Virus, is not, a 'Snake Flu.'

He and others are also skeptical that snakes could be the intermediate host, because there aren’t any documented cases of reptiles hosting coronaviruses that can transmit to humans. Their cold-blooded biology is just too different. 2019-nCoV, and its closest relative, SARS, belong to a subgroup known as beta-coronaviruses, which are only known to infect mammals. 

&#x200B;

 “It’s complete garbage,” says Edward Holmes, a zoologist at the University of Sydney’s Institute for Infectious Diseases and Biosecurity, who specializes in emerging RNA viruses, a class that includes coronaviruses like 2019-nCoV. Holmes, who also holds appointments at the Chinese CDC and Fudan University in Shanghai, is among a number of scientists who are pointing out—in virology forums, science Slacks, and on Twitter—what they deem to be major flaws in the paper, and calling on the journal to have it retracted. “It’s great that viral sequence data is getting shared openly in real time,” says Holmes. “The downside is then you get people using that data to make conclusions they really shouldn’t. The result is just a really unhelpful distraction that smacks of opportunism.”"

It mostly is, on a regular day to day basis. I mean if you're in the sticks they might pay an old lady to keep a first aid kit on hand, and she gets a few bucks a month to use it on anyone who needs it. They had [a more extensive system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barefoot_doctor#End_of_barefoot_doctors_in_China) but it broke down in the 80s.

For something worse, you may have to walk half a day and only spend $5 instead of the $30 it would 'normally' cost at a regional clinic.

But no one actually pays $30 for treatment from a high school grad with a few weeks of EMT training. If they have the $30 they're going to make a day of it and go to a city. And if instead they have $300 they're going to go to a bigger city. And if instead they have $3000, they'll go to the VIP ward of a major metropolitan hospital.

> I saw in some posts all treatment for the coronavirus was free for the Chinese

The treatment for coronavirus, and the new hospital and all of that, I don't think that's coming out of the regular healthcare budget. It think it's the Chinese version of FEMA paying for the outbreak.

It's an extraordinary event requiring a government response. If they don't offer free treatment, the people who can't afford it would walk around untreated.

It hasn't been that long, but already thousands are infected and dozens have died."

Also, pictures are coming out of hospital no. 4 in Wuhan shutting its doors because staff are now infected, so it's not just a young old and frail type worry. This shits infecting everyone.

An alleged nurse in Wuhan has recently posted a video saying the real number of infected is at 90000 and climbing exponentially, and also claims that for every 1 infected person that goes unchecked or untreated, will go on to infect 14 others. Do the math, that's not normal.

> Updated 8:52 AM. Lunar New Year festivities were canceled across mainland China on Saturday and scaled back in the semi-autonomous city of Hong Kong as authorities sought to limit the spread of the coronavirus.

> At least one hospital in the city at the heart of the coronavirus outbreak was transferring confirmed cases if the disease to other facilities, and not admitting any more patients as of Thursday, one resident whose partner works at the facility told CBS News.

> The Chinese city of Huanggang, only about 20 miles east of Wuhan, the city at the center of the coronavirus outbreak, has reportedly followed the example of Wuhan and ordered a halt to all public transport links in and out.

2020-01-25,Sharpintro888,australia,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/australia/comments/eto8cq/coronavirus_australia_three_cases_confirmed_in/ffjkg1y/,"Australia is INCREDIBLY unprepared for this. We are not taking it seriously enough at all. 

I have Chinese friends who relatives are in places as far away from Wuhan as Shanghai and Shandong. They told me their relatives are being told NOT TO GO OUTSIDE unless absolutely necessary. Shanghai and HK have issues emergency level warnings. Chinese people here, who know what is going on back home (and perhaps are suspicious of the CCP government figures- who knows whether they are correct or not?) If you have been to pharmacies in any of the Chinese areas of Sydney (ie. Green Square, Mascot) you will have noticed signs saying that they are completely sold out of face-masks already. 

However... from ABC news re: confirmed cases who were on flights from China:

^(Dr Chant said none of the men showed symptoms on the flights.""We do not believe that they were infectious at the time of their international flight,"" she said."")

How does this add up? We don't know exactly how the disease spreads yet, and yet we are saying these people on these flights weren't spreading the disease (airplanes are notoriously dangerous places for the spread of disease due to close quarters and recycled air). Furthermore, one of the men from the flight is REPORTED to have fallen sick in the immediate hours after he exited the plane:

^(NSW Health said the third man arrived in Sydney on China Eastern Flight MU749, which touched down at 11:35am on January 20.)

^(He developed symptoms that night and subsequently saw a doctor, later being diagnosed with the virus.)

We do not yet know that much about how easily this disease is spread. However there have been cases of super-spreaders ([https://www.scmp.com/news/china/society/article/3047441/wuhan-medical-staff-being-infected-virus-much-faster-pace](https://www.scmp.com/news/china/society/article/3047441/wuhan-medical-staff-being-infected-virus-much-faster-pace)) and carriers who show NO SIGNS OF ILLNESS ([https://www.scmp.com/news/china/society/article/3047636/doctors-warn-china-coronavirus-carriers-may-show-no-symptoms](https://www.scmp.com/news/china/society/article/3047636/doctors-warn-china-coronavirus-carriers-may-show-no-symptoms)).

Additionally, for many diseases, the first 24 hours BEFORE the patient starts showing signs of illness are the MOST contagious period of the disease. 

Now let's talk about **pandemic potential:**

US epidemiologists have run simulations showing the cost of a global, uncontrolled Wuhan coronavirus pandemic to be in excess of 60 million deaths worldwide ([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9lVJ6IlE4k&t=475s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9lVJ6IlE4k&t=475s)). 

If we can believe the Chinese authorities the mortality rate is somewhere around the 2% mark with those worst effected by the disease being the elderly / those with pre-existing medical conditions.

The worry isn't isolated pockets of this disease. It's the potential for it to become a full-on pandemic.

Has anyone seen the movie *Contagion*? It might be worth having a look. Many of the deaths in a pandemic are not directly a result of the disease. It is rather the strain that an out-of-control epidemic puts on a health system. You're looking at it right now in Hubei. Hospitals overrun, with many people unable to see a doctor for days; many people with treatable illnesses being in proximity with virus carriers and then becoming infected and dying; health-professionals in proximity to patients getting sick and putting a further strain on the health system;  services such as transport and food-markets being closed due to employee absenteeism; subsequent lack of resources and looting etc etc. 

This is why it's so important that all those with the disease, or who have come in contact with those with the disease are found and isolated **immediately**! we need to nib this thing at the bud before it gets out-of-control."

There is currently no treatment recommended for coronavirus infections except for supportive care as needed. Several antivirals and other agents were used during the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) outbreak, but the efficacy of these drugs has not been established. (See ""Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)"", section on 'Treatment'.)

Chloroquine, which has potent antiviral activity against the SARS-CoV [96], has been shown to have similar activity against HCoV-229E in cultured cells [97] and against HCoV-OC43 both in cultured cells and in a mouse model [98]. However, there have been no studies of efficacy in humans.

Preventive measures are the same as for rhinovirus infections, which consist of handwashing and the careful disposal of materials infected with nasal secretions. Several antiseptic/disinfectant solutions used commonly in hospitals and households, including chloroxylenol, benzalkonium chloride, and cetrimide/chlorhexidine, have been shown to be ineffective against coronaviruses [99].

There has been little interest in developing vaccines for the non-SARS community-acquired coronaviruses for several reasons. First, four separate species have been described and there is evidence within at least one of these species of clinically significant antigenic variation [35]. In addition, vaccine enhancement of disease has been shown for one animal coronavirus, feline coronavirus; hypersensitivity was induced in some animals by prior exposure to a vaccine containing the S protein, with the production of an immunologically mediated severe disease, feline infectious peritonitis, upon reinfection with a coronavirus [100]. There has been interest in the development of a SARS-CoV vaccine and a MERS-CoV vaccine. "

A good amount of them didn’t not carry it at all, like it was just a normal cold or something, but after being exposed to hundreds of people in the hospital they all become carriers. And people with other serious diseases have no access to medical services and some just passed away while waiting. 

So the official kept saying how important it is to not panic, and it’s a lot better to stay at home and than going to the hospital if it’s just a stomachache or whatever. And if it’s symptoms that suggest the virus, try 1. Self-quarantine 2. Report to health department 3. Use web med services to consult doctors online. first to avoid cross infection.

2020-01-25,Chayoss,medicine,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/medicine/comments/ets905/megathread_2019ncov_wuhan_coronavirus/ffipdly/,"Just worth a separate comment specifically for Imperial MRC's [excellent work](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/mrc-global-infectious-disease-analysis/news--wuhan-coronavirus/) so far. Their reporting has been clear without fearmongering.

They can fairly authoritatively summarise a few things that may have already been suspected:
>Self-sustaining human-to-human transmission of novel coronavirus (2019-nCov) is the only plausible explanation of the scale of the outbreak in Wuhan.

In other words, the current exacty reproductivity might be in flux, but it's definitely high enough (*ie R>1*) to be self-sustaining.

Prof Neil Ferguson of Imperial's MRC commented about this on [twitter](https://twitter.com/neil_ferguson/status/1221076998170271745):

>I think the evidence now suggests it is now rational to start planning for the scenario that containment efforts may not succeed. Accelerating health system preparedness and rapid approval of experimental therapeutics trial protocols. While *[ed sp]* of course enhancing control efforts.

Again, so much depends on the accurate reporting of data at the source right now to provide us with the right information for the models, and if we're only getting a partial or late picture, it's going to be tricky to provide more certainty:

>Our results emphasise the need to track transmission rates over the next few weeks, especially in Wuhan. If a clear downwards trend is observed in the numbers of new cases, that would indicate that control measures and behavioural changes can substantially reduce the transmissibility of 2019-nCoV.

>It is uncertain at the current time whether it is possible to contain the continuing epidemic within China. In addition to monitoring how the epidemic evolves, it is critical that the magnitude of the threat is better understood. Currently, we have only a limited understanding of the spectrum of severity of symptoms that infection with this virus causes, and no reliable estimates of the case fatality ratio – the proportion of cases who will die as a result of the disease. Characterising the severity spectrum, and how severity of symptoms relates to infectiousness, will be critical to evaluating the feasibility of control and the likely public health impact of this epidemic."

The point is we're at a time in history where many prominent thinkers feel a virus on the same category as this coronavirus is the biggest existential threat humans face. A similar virus wiped out 5% of the world's population barely a century ago - and risk factors are arguably much worse today.

So immediately dismissing an outbreak is pointlessly dangerous. There's yet to be a situation where ""unnecessary panic"" over a disease has manifested in problems, and the alternative is much worse - so being sanctimonious and thinking you know better than people (especially when it's become so clear you're just some techbro on the internet speaking confidently on a topic you lack a clear understanding of) and offering misinformed recommendations isn't helping anyone.

You know nothing about this virus, and there's plenty of reason to be wary of it as we learn more. Telling people to wash their hands and stop worrying about it is foolish, particularly from someone with virtually no understanding of the issue."

The business dispatch meeting listened to reports on epidemic prevention and control from various relevant departments in various places, fully affirmed the previous stage of work in our province, and put forward requirements for the next step.

Experts remind that there is a high incidence of respiratory infectious diseases in winter and spring, and indoor and public places must maintain indoor air circulation. The public should wash their hands frequently, pay attention to personal hygiene, try not to go to crowded places, and wear masks when you must. If you have fever or respiratory infection symptoms, especially if the fever persists, go to a medical institution for a fever clinic."

CORONAVIRUS is not a new virus. It has been around for at least two decades and is transmitted from animals to humans and then from humans to humans. It is said to have originated from eating cats, bats, and camels (depending on the strain). 2019-nCoV is a supposedly new strain of the coronavirus that surfaced in mid-December 2019 from a seafood market in China. 

Now follow with me: 

In 2004, the CDC filed a patent on a newly isolated coronavirus known as SARS. It expired on January 24, 2020 -- pure coincidence given the timing of this media outbreak I'm sure. 

In 2015, the Pirbright Institute filed a patent for a live attenuated coronavirus to be used in the production of vaccines. The Pirbright Institute is funded by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and recently received $5.5 million dollars to do what they do. They were ""coincidentally chosen"" to create the vaccine behind this current outbreak. 

They will be partnering with Inovio Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (funded by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation) to create said vaccine. This company brought you the zika quackxine in a record-breaking 7 months (run ... just ... run).

Inovio Pharmaceuticals will be partnering with Wistar (funded by Bill and Melinda Gates), GeneOne (funded by Bill and Melinda Gates and sponsored by the US FDA) and Twist Biosciences (funded by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation). If the Wistar Institute sounds familiar, it should. This is the company that produced the WI-38 cell line derived from the ""too many to count"" aborted fetuses in the vaccines injected into your children. 

In October of 2019, the John Hopkins Bloomberg School of Health (Center for Health Security) held ""Event 201,"" which simulated an outbreak of a theoretical coronavirus that ironically, looks exactly like what's playing out right now. It ultimately becomes a childhood disease for which we need to vaccinate against. Guess who it was funded by? The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. 

You really can't make this stuff up.

In fact, the mortality rate for the flu is 8-17% in hospitalized cases, which is probably where you are getting your number for the corona virus, as cases cannot be confirmed without direct medical testing. That is. 2-4 times increase in mortality of the current information we have about the coronavirus.

Tutto questo puó essere fatto in laboratorio nell´arco di settimane/mesi. 

Il coronavirus di cui sopra é stato isolato, ora devono capire come é diventato cosí aggressivo, quali proteine produce e come interagiscono nell´organismo umano (ad esempio capire cosa rende alcuni individui malati e altri solo portatori). In parallelo devono trovare una sostanza che blocchi i processi di riproduzione del virus, inattivando alcune proteine o attivando il sistema immunitario contro la superficie esterna del virus. Qualcosa di interessante sarebbe usare una tecnica che hanno usato negli stati uniti per una forma di leucemia infantile, ossia prelevare il virus )in quel caso tumore) e le cellule sane del sistema immunitario, metterle in un brodo e stimolare quelle cellule fin quando non sviluppano una reazione contro il tumore (virus)..a quel punto riinfonderle nel paziente (chiaramente per i grandi numeri non aiuterebbe, ma potrebbe aiutare a capire quale parte del sistema immunitario sia la piú efficacie..)"

It's a virus that's related to another virus (SARS) that is kind of like the flu. There's no cure, and symptoms take time to show up, meaning that it can spread without being known. SARS had a relatively high mortality rate for those with compromised immune systems and the elderly - so people worry that it's going to turn into something similar. 

In addition, the city with patient zero did little to prevent it spreading; there's talk that they arrested reporters / people who were claiming to have Coronavirus. This led to it spreading further than it needed to. 41 people have died last I've heard and if the government there had done more to prevent it spreading, those deaths likely wouldn't have happened. Not all of them at least. The hospitals in that city are above capacity; so that's another issue. It's also a big travel time with the lunar new year so there's increased fear of it spreading even further. 

If you don't live in China and aren't going to China, you're probably going to be fine. It's not super deadly, it's not spreading to other countries at a fast rate, if you did catch it you could probably get treated and be fine."

1. Help translate and update latest & reliable news and social media posts from Chinese, especially those more local issues. Like the ban on private cars.

2. Get connected to local Wuhan citizens. Many of them are volunteers who try to help those in need. If any non-Chinese got any issue, they could seek help from local residents. They could also get advice from the locals if they got any questions.

So far I have got in contact with a few non-Chinese in Wuhan. One of them worries about his tap water supply and whether it’s safe to order delivery food. The other wants to get a refund for canceling plane ticket.

They are slower to get news, cuz they don’t know Chinese and can’t use Weibo, where the latest info comes from. Such info could be fake news or real ones. We would try hard to get reliable ones. Even though the coronavirus was called “a rumor” by the govt at first.

Will the two things help? Any suggestions for any other ways we might help? How could we reach out to more non-Chinese in Wuhan? If you/someone you know are one of them, please share your thoughts or concerns. You can also PM me directly.

Actually any general suggestions are much welcome. Starting a program like this is completely new to many of us volunteers (no civil society obviously), so we are very able to act foolish and make mistakes. Please help us.

1. This will probably all blow over for most of us.
2. If’s good to prep early, before it makes obvious sense to prep, because, once prepping make sense, stores may be out of what you want. 
3. Live with kindness, dignity and consideration for others. Be prepared, but don‘t hoard or do things that make it hard for others to prep. 
4. Follow the CDC’s flu prep advice. The coronavirus seems to be like a bad kind of flu. 
5. Take all of the impact projections you see with a grain of salt. About 3 million people did in the United States every year. So, even a severe pandemic probably wouldn‘t have that impact on your risk of dying. The real threat is that you’ll be stuck at home for a few weeks and life will be boring. 
6. See if you have access  telemedicine services through your health plan  or can get telemedicine services on your own, so you have a way to get care even if clinics near you are overloaded or getting around is hard. Set up a password now, when everything is normal."

Most people don't get symptoms so never realise they had the virus, like most viruses. For reference world population is growing at just over 1 % per year, so even if everyone caught it today the world population would still keep growing.

At about 2 people dying in every 1000 then most people won't even directly know someone who dies from coronavirus if it spreads worldwide. SARS had a fatality rate of about 10% but had a very low R0 value. Most viral pathogens have a trade off between infectiousness and severity of infection like this, and tend to become more infectious and less damaging to the host as they mutate over time.

The stuff about being the most infectious virus ever is nonsense since measles has and R0 value of 10-20 by comparison to the new coronavirus of about 3. It is still high enough for it to spread widely though and probably wont be contained."

The very similar SARS-CoV, as well as MERS-CoV, both came from bats, although they both had other mammal intermediaries (palm civets and raccoon dogs for SARS-CoV, camels for MERS-CoV).

We've known for years that lots of SARS-CoV-like viruses exist in bat populations (same goes for MERS-CoV), and that at least some of these viruses are readily capable of infecting and replicating in human cells without needing to adapt much, if at all.

Given the extremely high degree of genetic similarity to SARS-CoV and to a number of other related bat coronaviruses, as well as the highly similar circumstances to the spread of SARS (both diseases started in wet markets, for example), it's pretty overwhelmingly clear that we're dealing with a bat coronavirus.

Isn't a low mortality rate bad? Ebola burned itself out due to how fast it killed its host. HIV is prevalent because it takes a long time to kill its host.

And WHO estimates incubation at about [2-14 days](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/about/symptoms.html), and it wasn't really treated as anything serious until about [mid-January](https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2020/01/24/798661901/wuhan-coronavirus-101-what-we-do-and-dont-know-about-a-newly-identified-disease).

> While the crew of flight TR 188 had to be isolated, the plane made a return trip back to Singapore after it was disinfected, added the spokesman.

Norovirus is a very common virus that has been around for many years. It causes vomiting and diarrhea and is frequently a problem in cruise ships and other concentrations of people. It is not related to the coronavirus or 2019-nCoV. There has been some diarrhea reported but most symptoms  for the 2019-nCoV are respiratory. 

>symptoms: pneumonia (41, 100%), fever (40, 98%), cough (32, 76%), and fatigue (18, 44%). Over half of patients also experienced shortness of breath (22, 55%), but headache (3, 8%) and diarrhea (1, 3%) were uncommon.  http://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2020/01/studies-highlight-ncov-similarity-sars-family-transmission  

The 2019-nCoV shares 96% of its genetic make with a common bat virus and the ""wet-market"" where it all started had live bats being sold. Biowarfare is very, very, unlikely.

You said test the people who appears sick. 

Here is the comment

""A person dies and is suspected of having coronavirus. Do you test the corpse, or the 50 people he came into contact with before his demise?""

Then, in case you don't know the symptoms, it appears as if you had a cold. Now, until you test them you wouldn't know. So if you were to test all the people who have die who have show symptoms in flu season, then you take the mortality rate of people amortized them and then check to see how many people show SYMPTOMS of cold. That is a CRAP TON of people. Old people tend to get sick. They tend to get cold. They don't die from it. But they show symptoms. And they die.

Keeping them out of school for 14 days would probably reduce the risk however more information will come to light. If the onset of symptoms is short then this will be easier to contain and won't spread as well, especially if sick people wear surgical or other masks.

Wuhan virus is a coronavirus. They are usually fairly contagious through droplets and usually only cause mild URI symptoms.

> That doesn't sound like there was a big CCP cover-up to me.

Ya, so about that. There is the problem of China formally alerting the WHO on Dec 27th that 27 residents had become infected with an unknown pathogen and then thereafter arresting people for spreading rumors that the pneumonia was a coronavirus. 

https://wemp.app/posts/da804f94-465b-4d78-93f5-4d6e71823ec0

And then taking 2 weeks to release the sequence results. Surprise, it's a coronavirus. Here's the rub: Since China sells machines that can identify unknown RNA sequences in hours (e.g. RNA-seq) it's a little bit dubious for them to take 16 days to sequence the virus. I could get an undergraduate to identify Coronavirus by ELISA from clinical samples in 2 days with equipment from the 90's. I could ship unprimed viral RNA to China to be sequenced in under 7 days. So yeah, there's a wide disparity between China's known capacity and how quickly they're reporting."

The  article (linked above) says that the Chinese government is pressing  workers to make a hospital in a week. I think that this will be the  first of many attempts to spin the virus in a positive light (i.e. to  save face). This one-week hospital was reported on the BBC news tonight,  and it seemed to imply that this action was taken by a decisive  government out of concern for its people and which is able to move  mountains to make things happen quickly.

However, I have my doubts. This action in particular says a few things. A hospital ready in a week says:

1. It says that in a week, a big hospital will still be needed. This is a problem not solvable in that time.
2. The building has to be rushed, and quality can't be assured, even to the usual standards.
3. This is happening because information was throttled for a month leading to more people than necessary spreading the disease.
4. The  infection appears to have started because of some pretty grim food  standards and a weird penchant for wild meat (at least from what I've  read). The combination of these two make spread of illnesses inevitable.
5. This  is happening during the lunar new year. This holiday is usually the  evident positive pieces of news which will reach international news  channels in a year: millions of people traveling the country on the  train system to visit family (and we all know how important family is to  Chinese people) - that's easy to spin as a win for the CCP. Instead,  the news is focusing on yet another preventable, infectious situation,  which potentially threatens the entire world. Worst of all, the Chinese  regime seems to have repeated a lot of the mistakes it made during the  SARS outbreak, which is a hit in the eye for the people who argue that  Communist China is able to deal with problems because it doesn't get  bogged down in the routines and scrutiny evident in democratic systems.

In  conclusion, This whole 'hospital in a week' situation is an example of  the CCP's practice of putting a positive spin on a negative situation,  and there will be more to come (my guess, doctors working for so long  they get sick themselves, a pious son travelling great distances to look  after his sick parents, the cure being developed through TCM methods,  etc.) but don't forget why these are happening in the first place.

P.S. stay as safe as you can everyone, I really hope that the situation there gets under control."
