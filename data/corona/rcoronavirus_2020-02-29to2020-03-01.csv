We are extremely unprepared for a mass casualty event of this magnitude...even a fraction of what happened in Hubei.

Our hospitals are mostly for profit which means that every empty bed means lost costs.  The hospitals get by on purpose with the minimum staff to protect earnings.  The recent Medicare spending changes and partially Obamacare has changed payment models and hospitals who can't keep up are closing

Therefore, even a moderate flu season overwhelms the ER, the floors, the ICUs, the mechanical ventilator and ECMO capabilities at even the best academic centers in a major city, not to mention the small poorly funded community hospitals

This is twice to thrice more contagious than the flu with a real 1-2% mortality rate, not to mention a 5% ICU rate.

I agree with most of the things in your post and I'm not saying this part is false either, but this part might be a very new things. In some provinces it's normal to pickup the food with your hands from the plate, it's also very common to see people sharing a single plastic cup to drink water from some kind of cooler full of water. On the topic of hand washing, at work most people don't use soap when coming out of the toilet and I must be the only one on my floor to wash my hands when I arrive in in the morning.

* Average onset date (among the 44,672 Chinese cases on Feb 11) - Jan 27 (Note. this is an eyeball average based on the [FIGURE 3.](http://weekly.chinacdc.cn/fileCCDCW/journal/article/ccdcw/2020/8/PIC/COVID-19-3.jpg)) which is 15 days before Feb 11.
* Average onset date (among the 163 Cruise ship cases with known onset dates) - Feb 8, which is 20 days before Feb 28.
* Average onset date (among the 115 Cruise ship passengers cases with known onset dates) - Feb 7, which is 21 days before Feb 28.

Two possible scenarios and the implications

* about half, or perhaps the majority of the final death tolls on the cruise ship should have been realized on Feb 28, because thats 20-21 days after the average onset date.
   * the CFR\_cruiseship (which should be closer to the true CFR of this disease, since this is the only place in the world that you can reasonably expect the 100% detection ratio) is unlikely to rise to the point on par with CFR\_Chinese. it'll likely stop at around 1.5-2.0% for age ≥ 60. it could go further, but it's very unlikely to hit 5.96% statistically, not to mention 9.31%.
   * if it stops at 2.0% for age ≥ 60, this suggests COVID-19 is approx. 2.4x lethal than seasonal flu, not 10-30x. this also suggests true CFR\_all\_age would be somewhere between 0.2% (if you use 8.6x difference between CFR\_flu\_all\_age and CFR\_flu\_age≥65) and 0.7% (if you use 2.6x difference between CFR\_Chinese\_all\_age and CFR\_Chinese\_age≥60). any observed\_CFRs that exceed the estimated CFR above can be explained by underdetection (which is inevitable except for the cruise ship).
* due to the unique situation that allows early detections, only a small portion of the final death tolls on the cruise ship has been realized on Feb 28.
   * this could be a reason for the relatively high asymptomatic rate (318/619=51.37%, as of Feb 20). they've been detected, but yet developed symptoms. if that's the case and almost all (or vast majority) of them develop symptoms later on, then it's about a week or two early to estimate the CFR\_cruiseship (because the average incubation period is expected to be around 4-7 days and the average duration between the first symptom and death is expected to be around 14 days).
      * however, it's possible that (vast) majority of the 318 asymptomatic cases will never develop any symptoms and remain asymptomatic throughout.
   * if the CFR\_cruiseship rise above 2% and keep rising, then this scenario gain more credibility.

CFR\_Korean (which seems to have relatively higher detection rate) suggests the former. They're currently sitting at 0.53% (17/3,150), and if you remove the oddball cohort (i.e. the psych ward patients, which has an unusually high CFR of 7/100), CFR\_Korean drops to 0.32% (10/3,050). In case of wondering why removing the cohort, imagine a 63 y/o male psych ward patient who had lived in the psych ward for more than 20 years and weighted 42kg (92lbs in freedom unit) before the infection (i.e. the first death case both in Korea and the psych ward). That's why.

Anyway, why am I talking about the CFR? Because the share of severe patients for each respiratory diseases are usually proportionate to their death rates. Double or triple the death rates, then you got the share of ARDS (which requires ICU admissions) or ICU admissions. Double that again, then you got the share of patients that require oxy mask.

For example, about 20-25% of SARS1 (which ended up with 774/8,096=9.56% CFR) patients admitted to ICU and about 40% of SARS1 patients developed oxygen dependency. In comparison, only 16 out of 3,150 Koreans are currently on either oxy mask, or ECMO, or ventilators, or admitted to ICU. And the cumulative number of severe patients is well below 100. This is much lower rate, compare to Chinese data, since China reported 461 severe cases on Jan 27 when they only have 2,741 cases."

My close family member is an ICU doctor and was horrified that the entire hospital system has no plan for isolation of large numbers of people, and they have like 30 beds in a metro area.

He and admins had to literally draw up a plan, learn about how to create a negative pressure room with HVAC and had a bunch of meetings on what the signs should say and how they did be hung on the wall. They had no plan and it is a good, large hospital system. 

They run out of ventilators occasionally when the flu gets really bad. Then they usually put patients all over the hospital for overflow when they run out of ICU beds. I think if you're lucky you have two ECMOs, which takes a lot of staff. 5 is insane.

They will run out of vents and have to transfer people but there is no advanced protocols on how to train people to disinfect entire rooms or transferring patients. 

This is going to be *ongoing.* It is terrifying how unprepared we are, even when every medical professional *knows* that this was a possibility. Doctors are busy and shouldn't have to come up with protocols on their own during a crisis.

Thailand and Malaysia report cases when they occur, and they seem to be only occurring in people travelling back from countries with known widespread infection.

Now that situation might change, but why would the entire southern hemisphere lie about this? Nothing reported in India, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, Myanmar, Laos, Vietnam, Cambodia, Indonesia, Philippines, etc etc for several weeks. There's clearly a pattern where tropical climates are not seeing rapid spread.

Of course it might also be because they are not catching these cases and it's spreading unnoticed, but I find it hard to believe every single one of those countries is suppressing information that people are coming down with COVID19."

2020-02-29,pooheygirl,Coronavirus,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/fbcirj/australia_business_leaders_from_china_are_among/fj3gprp/," 

Almost 100 foreign citizens who had been in China — many of them “business leaders” — were snuck in Australia’s back door after the federal government gave them an exemption from the coronavirus travel ban.

It is understood the business leaders, diplomats and other travellers allowed to enter Australia passed an initial health screening and state health departments rubber-stamped the request. Each individual was also required to self-isolate for 14 days.

However, medical research platform medRxiv has warned that, based on cases from China, symptoms may not manifest themselves for as long as 24 days.

Obviously there is also the concern that one or more of these special exemptions may have broken their self-isolation at some stage.

The Sunday Telegraph can reveal that Australia’s border boss authorised border clearance for 99 non-citizens.

Last month the government announced any foreigner who had travelled to China would not be allowed to enter Australia for 14 days from the time they left.

The National Security Committee of Cabinet agreed to the ban on February 1 in an attempt to try and stop the spread of the coronavirus.

On Friday the government extended its coronavirus travel ban for another week amid fears a Covid-19 global pandemic will soon be declared

The ban does not apply to Australian citizens, permanent residents and their immediate family as well as aircrews.

The government confirmed that Australia’s Border Force Commissioner has used his discretionary powers on 28 occasions to permit entry to 99 foreigners.

A spokesman from the Department of Home Affairs said the Commissioner only used discretionary powers in “compelling or compassionate circumstances” and where the relevant health authorities support the request.

Diplomats who are residents in Australia and Chinese citizens receiving treatment in Australia or visiting sick loved ones were also among those smuggled in.

Last month Chinese woman Xianglan Ren was also allowed to enter Australia to see her son Li Changxiang before doctors at the Royal Melbourne Hospital turned off his life support."

With that definition of cataclysm anything could be considered cataclysmic. Literally any armed conflict or terrorist attack could be considered cataclysmic. 9/11 killed 3,000 people and got the US into several forever wars and started the legal tracking of all us citizen and tracking of ""problem"" people from other countries you don't hear people calling that cataclysmic even though that event had just as much if not more global repercussions as this outbreak.🤔🤔

To me and most other sane people cataclysmic means the end times, it means the world is ending. Not ""oh man shit got bad for a while"" 

>Which it already has, for god's sake look at China. 

Im sorry but I don't see how 3,000 people died in a country of almost 1,500,000,000 people=a cataclysmic event.  Its shitty yes but perspective is important

>IF you think that this isn't a big event that warrants worry

I literally never said that. In fact i said it would have lasting economic repercussions and that you should probably take some steps to protect yourself but i guess you didn't read that part. 

Once again it has only been three months. It takes times to make a vaccine.  It took the CDC literally months to figure out people dying from lung infections were from counterfeit wax vapes and not E-juice not even a year ago. 

Once again I ask what worrying and frightening yourself on line helps in any way? What are you doing with your life right now that you weren't doing before this outbreak started? 

Unless you live in a Asian country or a underdeveloped country or go to international events/tourist spots you will probably be okay

If you want to be afraid that is all on you and noone can stop you or tell you how to feel but this is a thread about putting a suicide hotline number on this sub because there is so much fearmongering going on people really think they need to kill themselves before it gets ""bad"" and that is not okay. 

Slight worry is okay. Complete hysteria and panic is not.

Some say it is because in winter people are indoors more and so people are mixing more.

Some say it is temperatures affecting survival on surfaces.

Some say it is lack of vitamin D from the sun due to low sun angle and reduced number of daylight hours.

Some say it is because cold weather affects lining of the nose.

Nobody knows for sure, I think it is very difficult if not impossible to test to get definitive answer."

From what I saw it sounds like they said to expect school closures, and to work from home. I agree that they don’t seem like they intend to force mandatory quarantine or lockdowns. From what I heard it sounds like they’re asking the community to do their part to at the spread. Tbf, from what I’ve read from Americans on these forums (I’m Canadian, haha, but a city 45 min from me got a community case so I figured I would see what you guys were saying) many of them would not be ok with forced measures. Quite a few posters made sure to stock up on ammo to fight the military and police because they weren’t being forced into a quarantine. Idk how representative that is of the general USA population, but maybe they want to see if the community can slow it down on their own first?

Idk if community measures would work because people are inherently selfish and jobs give limited (sometimes no) sick days. It also sounded like one of guys who asked a question talked about why social gatherings and social events should be stopped for a mild cold, but it was a bit hard to hear. 

I expect less in Canada, though. Toronto had a case in young and Ellington today (very busy street) that had contact with a classroom full of people and all they sent out was a letter. No closures, no disinfecting, nothing. Hopefully that’ll change tomorrow."

That was at 31 cases, now it’s at 50.....

Other main concern was on return - could I realistically self isolate ? I have older parents and would I feel comfortable going to see them 3 weeks after returning or 4 weeks knowing that this virus can be lingering around ? And the answer was no. 

Good news is everything except train tickets and Vrbo refunded. Shout out to American Airlines- they have given me a travel voucher for the tickets to be used within a year. Even though Spain is not on any watch list, they completely understood my concerns and could not have been any more helpful.

Is the virus infections during the incubation period?

Available facts show that the new coronavirus infects when the patient is ill and in connection with the illness. The knowledge and experience we have right now also shows that people do not become infected during the incubation period, that is, the time span between the time of infection and when the disease breaks out. However, those who have been exposed to infection should be aware of early signs of illness.

We base our position on, among other things, the following:

There are solid scientific studies and a scientific evaluation on the coronavirus that causes the disease sars, which spread throughout the world in spring 2003. Evaluations from that outbreak clearly show that the sars-coronavirus does not infect at all during the incubation period. Among all known viral diseases, it is very uncommon to be infected during the incubation period. However, many viruses are infected when the disease breaks out. There is therefore much evidence of a similar course of events even for the new coronavirus covid-19.

Many export cases of the ongoing covid-19 outbreak from China have now been identified. Among these cases, there are no confirmed descriptions of infection spread during the incubation period.

Knowledge about the new corona virus is added every day and we follow the knowledge situation closely. If new facts emerge that give us reasons to change our assessments, we will communicate this. The Public Health Authority cooperates closely with the WHO on these issues."

Since we couldn't even get a simple testimony in the Senate, we've accepted that the other side simply does not care.

Now, we are 100% focused on a global pandemic. We complain about  the incompetent autocrat only because we wish he would shut up. His conspiracy theories only exacerbate the real dangers. We understand that his cult will not disappear. We just want him to STFU.

On the ""right"", where they have long claimed that all good news was a result of Their Leader's wise actions, they are defending him constantly -- not against us, but against the virus itself. They view the virus as the greatest threat to His Presidency. The rest of us honestly do not care. We just want him to shut up already!"

So you’d have to either send blood samples in the right conditions to maintain the virus or take fecal samples and look at them through an extreme microscope that are either only available at some hospitals/research facilities. Also, people need to have bio safety level 4 GOVERNMENT clearance (which I think is the highest level) to be able to work with viruses like this and test for them.

Lots of Asian cultures promote mask wear (basic sanitary masks) to prevent the wearer from accidentally spreading what they have.. .i.e disease spread via coughing and sneezing is reduced as the mask captures a significant amount of the particles.

Wearing the same mask without being sick, does provide a modicum of benefit, if nothing more than to keep your fingers away from your nose and mouth, as well as potential for some filtration of the airborne particles.

N95 masks don't work this way. They have a high filtration rate, providing substantual protection to the wearer from airborne particles. However most of these masks come with a exhale vent, which allows the wearer to freely exhale through the vent, which seals back up again for the filtered inhalation. This is why N95 masks are inherently different from the sanitary masks... They protect different people.

Did I buy some masks, yes, were they N95, yes. Have I worn any of them? No. I had a work trip take me to Tokyo this month, I took some with me as an exit strategy if needed. I knew I could wear them long enough to get stateside if an outbreak occurred."

You seem to know *why* they are not effective for random people use (single use, risks of touching your face often etc). I am sorry but do you trust people to disinfect masks correctly? False sense of protection is very dangerous. Imagine people who disinfect their masks poorly and walk around everyday breathing trough a used mask potentially infecting themselves and their loved ones, touching their masks with their dirty hands every 45 seconds... Their really is a million reason I agree with this. I am not for governments lying though but you know it’s going to happen during crisis because they don’t trust the people’s ability to understand what they must and must not do (I don’t trust the people either), hell, governments lie even when there are no crisis 😂 why would they suddenly be super honest?

Of course they would, they help to stop the spread from people breathing coughing and sneezing on each other (including the unknowingly infected) and help to remind people not to touch their faces all the time. Masks and frequent use of hand sanitiser when out and about is what they should be advising (second to travel bans, lockdowns and quarantines of course).
Also, what about the masks that many of us already have? I know ideally you would use once and dispose, but there might be other options they could advise us on, such as disinfecting the same mask after each use instead of throwing it away, or making your own mask as many people have also done.

But as far as the comment what would be the mortality rate if we do did not have a vaccine is a valid point but a vaccine is different then a treatment after one gets the virus.  A vaccine is a prevention measure. How the mortality rate of the H5N1 regular influenza is measured is a the percentage of those that get the virus as tested in a pcr test die.  Sure the sample size might and I say might be bigger if we had no preventive vaccine.  But the extrapolated numbers would be within a 5% confidence level.   I also saw might as the vaccine does not work really well for the old young infirmed patient.  It works best only healthy aged adults. This is backed by hundreds of scientific studies on this vaccine.  Thousand and thousands of old young pregnant and infirmed people get the flu each year even though they had the vaccine. That said I at age 59 take the vaccine every year because I believe and ounce or prevention is worth a pound of cure.  I got the flu these year around Christmas worse then I have ever had it in my life and I am very healthy. No hypertension now chronic conditions but got it bad.  It opened my eyes to how a vaccine does not always work.  What we need for this new virus is an anti viral drug tied to RNA of this new virus. Problem it will take 1.5 to 2 years to hit the street because of the FDA. The FDA put there to protect us in a situation like this harms us.

- The virus mostly spreads through coughing and sneezing(droplets in the air). Those who don’t show symptoms, do not pose a threat to spreading it further.

- Someone can, on average, spread it to 2-3 other persons(leas than with measels). This number will go on and decline, because of all the precautions. 

- By far most of the people have light(feverish)symptoms.

- Almost all fatalities are elderly or sick people.

Pence’s policy led to some career experts canceling television appearances, though they have told lawmakers the administration is not silencing them. 
“We want open, clear, rapid, fast, transparent communication,” the senior administration official said, pointing to a Friday press briefing with White House officials and Health and Human Services Department Secretary Alex Azar, and other media events. “[Pence] is just trying to make sure they’re not unintentionally scaring the American public by having people on at every hour of every single cable network, and saying different things each hour.”
