> GENEVA - There has been &quot;Limited&quot; human-to-human transmission of a new coronavirus that has struck in China, mainly small clusters in families, but there is potential for wider spread, the World Health Organisation said on Tuesday.

> The WHO is however preparing for the possibility that there could be a wider outbreak, she told a Geneva news briefing.

> Some of the virus types cause less serious disease, while some like the one that causes the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome are far more severe.

When was the ""influenza pandemic"" of the 1990s? Zika was hardly a life-threatening disease and contained, not a pandemic. Neither was ebola. What are you talking about? You sound like a panicked conspiracy theorist. 

Three worldwide (pandemic) outbreaks of influenza occurred in the 20th century: in 1918, 1957, and 1968. The latter 2 were in the era of modern virology and most thoroughly characterized. All 3 have been informally identified by their presumed sites of origin as Spanish, Asian, and Hong Kong influenza, respectively. They are now known to represent 3 different antigenic subtypes of influenza A virus: H1N1, H2N2, and H3N2, respectively. Not classified as true pandemics are 3 notable epidemics: a pseudopandemic in 1947 with low death rates, an epidemic in 1977 that was a pandemic in children, and an abortive epidemic of swine influenza in 1976 that was feared to have pandemic potential. Major influenza epidemics show no predictable periodicity or pattern, and all differ from one another

SARS

>Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is a viral respiratory illness caused by a coronavirus, called SARS-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV). SARS was first reported in Asia in February 2003. Over the next few months, the illness spread to more than two dozen countries in North America, South America, Europe, and Asia before the SARS global outbreak of 2003 was contained.

https://www.cdc.gov/sars/about/fs-sars.html


According to the CDC, 4 influenza pandemics have happened in the last 100 years, recently in 2009 (Swine flu).

>Swine flue [sic] and SARS didn't kill many people and those it did kill were old or weakened already

That's because there was relatively quick reaction (some may say overreaction, but hindsight is 2020), better to overeact than be dead, exponential growth is a bitch.

Also I did not advocate for centralization, only planning, coordination and a carefully applied force, I don't think such a problem can be solved without these things, but you have a chance to prove me wrong once you start taking it seriously."

> The Thai Health Ministry said on Monday that of 12 passengers quarantined since Jan. 3, lab results show that a 61-year-old Chinese woman carried a strain of the coronavirus.

In contrast to China’s early efforts to cover up the SARS epidemic that first struck southern China in 2002 and eventually spread worldwide, China has handled the outbreak of a new mystery pneumonia very differently. Within weeks of detection of the initial outbreak in December in Wuhan, China has already identified the novel coronavirus (“nCoV”) that is the likely cause of infection in 41 patients and shared the genetic sequence of that virus with the world to allow for specific laboratory testing.

Hong Kong, likewise, has offered an exemplary model for how to respond to the outbreak—and others that are sure to come. Immediately after publicly recognizing the Wuhan outbreak on Dec. 31, the Hong Kong Department of Health and its Centre for Health Protection took a series of precautionary steps. Those started with public guidance for health workers, schools, and extended-care facilities. Authorities also spoke with the media about the disease and created a dedicated webpage for information on the outbreak in Wuhan, which they updated daily. On Jan. 4, Hong Kong also posted a detailed “Preparedness and Response Plan for Novel Infectious Disease of Public Health Significance (2020)” on this site. The document is perhaps the first such comprehensive plan for a novel infectious disease that has been publicly released anywhere in the world.
