>But when both were tested a second time for the coronavirus on Sunday, March 22, as a precondition for seeking medical care for unrelated health issues, **they tested positive for the coronavirus even though they exhibited none of the typical symptoms, such as a fever or dry cough**. The time from their recovery and release to the retest ranged from a few days to a few weeks.

>It is possible they were first given a false negative test result, which can happen if the swab used to collect samples of the virus misses bits of the virus. **Dr. Li Wenliang, a whistleblowing doctor who later died of the virus himself in February, tested negative for the coronavirus several times before being accurately diagnosed.**

>In February, Wang Chen, a director at the state-run Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, estimated that **the nucleic acid tests used in China were accurate at identifying positive cases of the coronavirus only 30%-50% of the time.**

>Another theory is that, because the test amplifies tiny bits of DNA, **residual virus from the initial infection could have falsely resulted in that second positive reading**.

TLDR, they show traces of the virus but do not get sick again. They are being tested to make sure they're not contagious (they shouldn't be), and the primary culprit is probably just junk tests with ridiculous error rates."

Have you ever met any homeless people?  
You've never met mentally ill people that cause trouble?    
You've never met a drunk or drug addict that was causing trouble?  
Unfuckingbelievable.   

I lived at a homeless shelter for a while- I'd say 80% of the residents either had a drug/alcohol problem, a mental illness, or a dual diagnosis.   

Now that's just reality. I'm not stigmatizing anybody- that's just the fucking truth.   

E: People living on the street are likely self medicating with drugs/alcohol and not getting proper healthcare.   
Sometimes those people are going to act out, in antisocial, illegal ways.  Sorry if that fact upsets reddits' ""sunshine-and-rainbows"" view of homelessness and mental illness but that's life."

2020-03-27,Viewfromthe31stfloor,Coronavirus,44,https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/fq7iao/i_am_hospitalized_with_the_coronavirus/flozzo1/,"“On March 12 I got a fever that didn’t go away.

It hovered around 101 or 102 degrees for the next week, accompanied by severe fatigue and body aches. My office was already working remotely, so I powered through and kept at it, with lots of breaks and naps. I saw a doctor via video who said it was probably the flu — possibly the coronavirus, he added, but tests were unavailable and the prescription, rest and fluids, would be the same regardless.

I naturally worried about the coronavirus, but I didn’t have respiratory symptoms. I’m also a 45-year-old, generally healthy nonsmoker (I quit years ago) with none of the high-risk conditions listed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. I didn’t seem like a probable Covid-19 candidate.

Then, about a week in, I began to cough. Taking deep breaths felt as if fire were shooting through my lungs. My primary care doctor, with whom I also consulted via video, thought it was pneumonia and prescribed a course of antibiotics. New York State set up a coronavirus testing site an hour from my home. When I called for an appointment, I waited on hold for 80 minutes, after which someone took my information and said someone else would call me back. No one did.

Eight days after the fever first manifested, I could barely move. My wife took me to an urgent care clinic, where I received a chest X-ray and confirmation that I had pneumonia. They swabbed me for the coronavirus but their lab was overwhelmed, and they didn’t know when they would receive any results. I’ve still not heard from them.
I returned home in terrible shape, chest burning and wracked with chills, unable to do anything other than shudder under a blanket. My primary doctor urged my wife to take me to the E.R., which she did. There, they gave me a coronavirus test and another chest X-ray, but blood tests suggested that my oxygen and white blood cell levels were decent. They sent me home but insisted that should I feel worse, I should call them back immediately.

The next day, my temperature spiked to 103.5 degrees. We called the E.R., and they told us to come back. That night I was admitted to Northern Dutchess Hospital in Rhinebeck, N.Y.

The first night and day were a literal fever-dream of pricks, prods, scans and sweat. I floated in and out of consciousness and hallucinations as nurses drew blood from all over and gave me shots of blood thinner in my stomach, which became a daily routine. Someone took another chest X-ray.

On the second day I was more lucid but still felt horrendous, and a friendly doctor came in with two bits of news: The coronavirus test I took in the E.R. had come back positive and the latest X-ray wasn’t good. He showed me the earlier X-ray from the E.R.: Each lung had a cloudy patch near the bottom but was otherwise clear. Then he showed me the new X-ray. It looked liked some demented handyman had sprayed my lungs with insulation.

It was one of bleakest moments of the ordeal, surpassed only by the moment when I wondered, as I hugged my 9-year-old daughter goodbye on the way to the hospital, if I would ever hug her again.
My doctor said we’d stay the course and perhaps add another antibiotic to the mix. But if things didn’t start to turn around soon, he added, I would need to move into the intensive care unit. I lay back, utterly dispirited, and turned on the TV. It was on CNN. President Trump was telling someone he wanted to reopen the country by Easter.

A few weeks ago I would have rolled my eyes and made a joke about how he should socially distance himself on some Mar-a-Lago golf course. Just go away and let the adults figure things out.

But my experience has made this pandemic much less abstract, and left me in no mood for jokes. I’m writing this from my hospital bed in Rhinebeck, on Day 14 of my Covid-pneumonia saga.

It has been miserable in general, with spikes of both awful physical pain and real terror, given the uncertainties that still surround the disease and its outcomes. I think of my wife and daughter every minute.

But I also feel humbled and awed by the care I’ve received from nurses, doctors, technicians, cleaning and food staff members, all of them strangers who risk getting this disease every time they come in to help me, which they do over and over, day after day, with good cheer and expertise. It is heroic and moving.

Every time the president minimizes this crisis, he is making these people’s lives more difficult. When he makes the pandemic seem less serious than it is, he gives those inclined to disregard it license to do so.

The virus doesn’t care about political talking points. Fewer precautions taken across the country will result in more patients. Which means that the people now helping me, and the thousands like them all over the nation, will soon have more patients than they can handle. These people — who are leaving their own families behind every day to help other people’s mothers, fathers, children and grandparents — will be asked to do even more.
For me, things did start to turn around as the drugs did their work. My fever broke a day ago and my most recent chest X-ray shows signs of improvement. I am feeling better. I feel confident that I will hug my wife and daughter again, even though plenty of quarantining will remain for each of us — their health has been fine, thankfully — after I am discharged. I know how fortunate I am, thanks to the support of my family, friends and employer — and most crucially, having health insurance. I also know the country has only begun to contend with this crisis.

I’m also lucky to have had such excellent caretakers, who help me sit up and eat and bathe and rest and heal, all the while telling me how much they are praying for me. We cannot do enough for these people, who are selflessly performing the world’s most important work. They are saving our lives. They have saved mine.

As this crisis intensifies, we must think about how to make their lives easier, whether through direct bonus payments, student loan and debt forgiveness, free groceries, free child care or all of the above (or something else entirely). We must mobilize American industry to expand our medical infrastructure. People are conducting sewing drives to make masks for health care workers. That’s sweet and noble, but why aren’t companies like Proctor & Gamble churning them out by the millions? I saw a TV ad that said Ford will work with lessees affected by the coronavirus. Great. Now why don’t you get going on a few hundred thousand ventilators?

And of course, we must expand testing as rapidly as possible.

This is a national health emergency, and we must treat it with the seriousness it deserves. We must listen to the health professionals. And we must do everything we can to help them save us.

The kid originally went to an urgent care facility, which, despite the name, are not designed to handle life threatening situations.

His insurance status did not factor into his death. Hospitals in the US legally can not refuse life saving care, regardless of lack of insurance or payment.

And I want to make two points to you. I want to make two promises. This is a different beast that we are dealing with. This is an invisible beast, this is an insidious beast. This is not going to be a short deployment. This is not going to be that you go out there for a few days we work hard and go home. This is going to be weeks and weeks and weeks. This is going to be a long day and it’s going to be a hard day and it’s going to be a ugly day and it’s going to be a sad day. 

This is a rescue mission that you’re are on. The mission is to save lives, that’s what you are doing, the rescue mission is to save lives and as hard as we work we are not going be able to save everyone. and what’s even more cruel is this enemy doesn’t attack the strongest of us, it attacks the weakest of us. It attacks our most vulnerable, which makes it even worse in many ways, because these are the people that every instinct tells us we’re suppose to protect. These are our parents and our grandparents, these are our aunts our uncles, these are our relatives who is sick, and every instinct says protect them, help them, because they need us, and those are the exact people that this enemy attacks.  

Every time I’ve called out the national guard, I’ve said the same thing to you, I promise you I will not ask you to do anything that I will not do myself and I’ll never ask you to do go anywhere that I won’t go myself. And the same is true here. We are going to do this and we are going to do this together. 

My 2nd point is:

You are living a moment in history. This is going to be one of those moments they are going to write about and they are going to talk about for generations. This is a moment that is going to change this nation. This is a moment that forges character, forges people, changes people, make them stronger, make them weaker, but this is a moment that will change character.  

And ten years from now, you will be talking about today to your children or your grandchildren and you will shed a tear, because you will remember the lives lost and you’ll remember the faces, and you’ll remember the names, and you’ll remember how hard we worked and that we still lost loved ones, and you’ll shed a tear and you should, because it will be sad, but you will also be proud, you will be proud because of what you did. You’ll be proud that you showed up. You showed up. When other people played it safe, you had the courage to show up and you had the skill and the professionalism to make a difference and save lives. That’s what you will have done. And at the end of the day nobody can ask anything more from you, that is your duty, to do what you can when you can, and you will have shown skill and courage and talent, you’ll be there with your mind and you’ll be there with your heart, and you’ll serve with honor, and that will give you pride and you should be proud. I know I am proud of you. Every time the National Guard has been called out, they have made every New Yorker proud, and I’m proud to be with you yet again. And I’m proud to fight this fight with you. I bring you thanks from all New Yorkers who are just so appreciative of the sacrifice that you are making, the skill that you are bringing, the talent that you are bringing and you give many New Yorkers confidence. So I say my friends, that we go out there today and we kick Coronavirus ass. That’s what I say. And we’re going to save lives and New York is going to thank you. God Bless each and every one of you."

My coworkers and bosses have for the most part been laughing off the virus, and doing business as usual. It's all silly, it's just a flu, only old people die anyways, people who are worried are stupid, and this is all a hoax by the dems to discredit Trump.

I'm the only one taking 'extreme' measures. Using sanitizer constantly, cleaning my area as soon as each customer leaves, wearing a mask, and refusing to approach a customer without a face mask on.

I noticed this week a couple of us coughing and clearing throats.

I hope I'm just paranoid. I'm just afraid for all the good people here. I hate Oklahoma's government and policies with a passion. But these people have fully accepted everything but the facts and will be hit so hard by this virus. I don't know what to do, we're not locking down, we're not changing anything as a whole. Jusy a few people here and there wearing masks and staying away isn't going to stop this and I have a feeling that we're already in trouble."

>California, for instance, has been a national leader on smoking bans.

More data on California's life-saving measures:

>As the maternal death rate has mounted around the U.S., a small cadre of reformers has mobilized.

>Some of the earliest and most important work has come in California

>Hospitals that adopted the toolkit saw a **21 percent decrease in near deaths from maternal bleeding in the first year.**

>By 2013, according to Main, maternal deaths in California fell to around 7 per 100,000 births, similar to the numbers in Canada, France and the Netherlands — **a dramatic counter to the trends in other parts of the U.S.**

>California Maternal Quality Care Collaborative is informed by a professor of obstetrics and gynecology at Stanford and the University of California-San Francisco, who for many years ran the ob/gyn department at a San Francisco hospital.

>Launched a decade ago, CMQCC aims to reduce not only mortality, but also life-threatening complications and racial disparities in obstetric care

>It began by analyzing maternal deaths in the state over several years; in almost every case, it discovered, there was ""at least some chance to alter the outcome.""

>Meanwhile, life-saving practices that have become widely accepted in other affluent countries — and in a few states, notably California — have yet to take hold in many American hospitals.

Decent but inexpensive caviar is perhaps $15 per ounce. You could spend a lot more, but that's probably the stuff that the local sushi place is using.

There are 128 fluid ounces in a gallon. Caviar is sold by weight and denser than water, so there are more than 128 dry ounces per gallon.

When you have low oxygen your heart comes under a lot of stress and has to work harder by pumping faster and deeper to try and oxygenate the tissues. If this problem continues it can lead to organ failure, and in that case, a heart attack.

More data on California's life-saving measures:

>As the maternal death rate has mounted around the U.S., a small cadre of reformers has mobilized.

>Some of the earliest and most important work has come in California

>Hospitals that adopted the toolkit saw a **21 percent decrease in near deaths from maternal bleeding in the first year.**

>By 2013, according to Main, maternal deaths in California fell to around 7 per 100,000 births, similar to the numbers in Canada, France and the Netherlands — **a dramatic counter to the trends in other parts of the U.S.**

>California Maternal Quality Care Collaborative is informed by a professor of obstetrics and gynecology at Stanford and the University of California-San Francisco, who for many years ran the ob/gyn department at a San Francisco hospital.

>Launched a decade ago, CMQCC aims to reduce not only mortality, but also life-threatening complications and racial disparities in obstetric care

>It began by analyzing maternal deaths in the state over several years; in almost every case, it discovered, there was ""at least some chance to alter the outcome.""

>Meanwhile, life-saving practices that have become widely accepted in other affluent countries — and in a few states, notably California — have yet to take hold in many American hospitals.

I will say I was in a coma for half of the time, and won't go into that experience.  It's a whole different story.  I woke up at the point of being trached.

Here's my experience from what it's like being on a ventilator.

It's devastating. Not many people can truly fathom the deep sense of helplessness that comes from being in the ICU and on a ventilator.

Imagine being completely bed ridden and at the mercy of the few feet of tubing that's connecting you to the machine keeping you alive.

You have to use a bedpan to defecate because getting out of bed is such a tremendous undertaking, between the tubing coming out, but also the sheer lack of physical strength your oxygen starved muscles possess.

Speaking while intubated is impossible. You have to rely on pieces of paper, and praying that your muscle spasming hands can write clearly enough to communicate your needs. If not, the nurses grab a cross section image, with I need, I want, I have on one side and then a list of the most basic things spanning horizontally. Thirsty, hungry, bathroom, pain. They don't mean to treat you like you're a child with this, but it becomes the only way to communicate at times.

Then if you become frustrated or panicky at them not understanding, they will use restraints on your arms. This is to protect you from accidently causing damage to yourself.

All that you're left with at that point is the control box in your strapped down hand, flipping through the basic cable TV channels available as you're praying for the day when you can, at the least, hear the -now strange- sound of your own voice again, and move beyond the 3' x 7' isolated prison the disease has placed you in."
