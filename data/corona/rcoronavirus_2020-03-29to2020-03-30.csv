Usually they can tell if something is fatally wrong with the baby while it’s still in the womb, or shortly after birth. Obviously wait for an autopsy, but I think they would already have known.

As for other cases, again it would be unusual for a child or adult to have a mystery undiagnosed terminal illness and die from it the same time they caught the virus. 

Even those people who had underlying health conditions, they still developed pneumonia, had to go on a ventilator, quickly deteriorated and died from organ failure. Sure they’re underlying condition made them more vulnerable, but they still died from complications caused by the virus.

I don’t think anyone is dying from something else, and they just happen to have the virus.

Usually the media reports details of deaths, I have yet to see ‘John, who was days from death because of stomach cancer, tested positive for coronavirus but died of cancer before he developed any virus symptoms).

I think we can say with pretty much certainty  that anyone who has it, is hospitalised for it, and has to go on a ventilator and dies from lung or heart failure - it was the virus."

She hasn’t done it since and to this day, barely has any lung capacity because of the compound damage of 40 years of smoking and the hit the pneumonia took.  Her sister is a former smoker and has COPD still, and now lung cancer.  Her husband has had lung cancer twice and now has an almost 50% reduction in actual lung tissue.  My dad is a current smoker still (even after all that above).  I’m pretty sure if any of them get COVID-19, they will die.  Doesn’t help that they’re all obese and have high blood pressure too."

This is his argument after I asked him why the hospitals would be so overwhelmed if it is just as bad as the regular flu:

The hospitals are overwhelmed because people have had fear instilled in them by the media so instead of riding out the flu at home they rush to hospital and spread it further to people who already have pre-existing conditions, i.e. why they're in hospital in the first place. In Italy 99% of deaths are people with pre-existing conditions, healthy people are highly unlikely to succumb from this flu. 9 million people die from TB each year but no such media hype. 2.9 million in India alone yet no lockdown for TB. 17000 people died of seasonal flu in the UK last year but that's not sensational enough. The WHO said in 2009 that 1.4billion people will get swine flu and 570000 will die from it, yet around 1400 died. I could go on all day....

Look, I am not saying things are perfect here.  I am saying that efforts should be made internally to help out our own countries, and nothing (or very little) is gained by wagging fingers at other countries right now.  

I saw an English broadcaster today accuse China of not giving real numbers of their infected people.  WHILST PEOPLE IN ENGLAND ARE TOLD TO STAY AT HOME IF SICK AND THAT THEY WONT BE TESTED IF THEY DON'T NEED TO GO TO HOSPITAL.  So at the same time as they cry that China may have had more cases than they said, England is doing exactly the same thing.

Here's my view on this.  China did some things right, some things wrong.  Look for what was right, and try to do it too.  Then, STOP sending all our vital production to China.  STOP having them making our medical equipment, our drugs, our protective equipment.  STOP people living in debt their entire lives.  If we do these things, we can be better prepared.  We have shackled ourselves to this country willfully, it's time to separate."

2. Irrelevant to the point I am making.


3. You mean the loved ones of the ultra-wealthy health care and insurance execs who can afford the best quarantine measures and ultimately the best health care in the world if they get sick? Yeah, I'm sure they will be fine.

4. Begging the question. Do you not understand that the insurance and healthcare industry stand to make insane profits from this pandemic? You literally said 'no one wants people to get sick from not having access to masks' and I pointed out that there are indeed people, corporations and entire industries whose profit motive is tied to the number of people getting sick.

I shouldn't have even bothered replying to you but just for future reference, calling people idiots is not how mature individuals get their points across. You might want to work on that if you ever want to be taken seriously."
2020-03-29,Poopnastyface,Coronavirus,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/fr3h6b/more_americans_should_probably_wear_masks_for/fltl9yn/,"I think the comparison of telling people they don't need masks right now while healthcare workers are still lacking them is a far cry from those saying the concern about this amounts to a ""hoax"".

I hear people complaining about being told that masks ""do no good"" but I personally didn't see anything of the sort, and I've been balls deep in this since early Jan. On the other hand, I've heard numerous times, including on mainstream nightly news segments, about how surgical masks are more effective for those who are sick to wear while n95 masks are better for preventing infection for the wearer. Not a huge amount of misinformation that I've seen pushed broadly.

And you yourself are pointing out that medical workers don't have enough PPE to go around. Yelling about ""WHERE CAN I GET MASKS"" isn't constructive. You can't get them right now. You shouldn't be able to get them right now. Not until those who need them more, have them. I'm completely ashamed by how selfish some people in this country can be."

In general I am quite happy with the speed the government reacted initially, but I feel the people is not taking it seriously enough and there is too much leeway.

* Too many people on supermarkets (judging from number of cars on it yesterday, I did not even try entering).
* Farmer markets are still a thing, I don't see how crowd can be controlled there.
* I don't know when Lidl / Hofer /etc will tell/let their workers to wear masks, I feel bad for them, they are really exposed. 
   * By the way, all of them wear gloves, but I gloves are no miracle solution for anything. Notable mention to a spar cashier I saw ten days ago that was spraying her hands with water/alcohol after each customer. Bravo.
* I have not been near a child playground, but I would be surprised if they are not in frequent use."

And, in my opinion it detracts from the genuine predicament that nations are finding themselves in, one which applies to all Western nations including here in England. That being 'the economy' versus caring for communities and the most vulnerable within these communities.

There were wars in the 20th century that killed upwards of 10 million people and involved dislocation on a scale that completely dwarfs what we are seeing today. Yet, economies and infrastructure were rebuilt and the world went on. Likewise, economies will be rebuilt after this. 'The economy' has become a mantra that we're all so wedded to that some of us will unquestioningly place that above everything, following the general consensus, drummed into us day after day in the form of marketing; like lemmings following the party line verbatim.

What does it say about a society that places money above caring for its most vulnerable? In my opinion that is the sign of a broken society, and all Western nations are compelled to tackle this issue at this time, an issue many would rather not tackle. 

There is a popular misconception that economies can't afford to be damaged, and that caring for a small section of society will damage the lives of the majority due to economic recession and so on. I would argue it the other way 'round in that not caring for the vulnerable in society will have far reaching ramifications for the majority in terms of where that country is going in the next 50 years. A healthy society cares for its most vulnerable.

I'm not left-wing and I'm not right-wing. This isn't a political issue. It's day-to-day existence and what it means to be a human being. Do people care about other people or not? Do people think that 'the elderly' should be afforded a situation where they go out of this world with their families around them or not? Do people want seriously ill people to have a chance to recover or not? Do people want to help prevent the most vulnerable from catching this thing and dying or not? Ultimately, can people empathise with the most vulnerable or not, it could be your Mother or Father.

I hope that in my country when this is all over, a few priorities are re-set in terms of what we're all about as human beings."

All you can do is minimise that number as much as you can - by slowing the spread of the virus enough to allow the hospitals to treat everyone who needs it at any point in time. Even with treatment, about 50% die, but with no treatment 100% of those requiring ICU care die, so this is pretty much all you can do until there is herd immunity build, either by means of vaccine (a long way away) or gradually having people infected as per the current approach."

Is it our culture, lots of kissing/hugging/handshakes, whereas in Asia they bow from afar (and seem very reserved in terms of physical intimacy, judging from their TV shows at least)?

Is it the masks they wear?

The shoes they leave out of the house (I always hated that, because don't your feet get cold? But maybe it saves lives)

Do Asians have a higher percentage of ventilators, health care facilities and staff, protective gear etc?

Just be honest about why you don't want everyone wearing them, for fuck's sake: it's a very good reason.

\- Belgian hospital uses CT-scans to test 50 incoming not-corona-related patients (brain tumor, pregnant women, ...), 5 show signs of fluids in lungs typical of Corona and official tests showed them to be infected, even if they had no visible symptoms

\- this was considered a faster way to sort incoming patients, as the official test results take much longer

\- only a small sample (5/50, confidence interval 3-21%)

\- data is from Tuesday, official Belgian patient count is 10.000 today, but this sample implies 1 million infected. Belgian is focusing testing on hospital patients (and some guy's cat), so many cases go undetected

\- Brussels is not the most infected area

\- we really need more data from the following days to know what the current percentage is from a larger data set"

Anyhow, the healthcare workers are unable to protect themselves and as a result are getting sick and unable to care for patients, patients are already being told to go home because they can't be cared for at the hospital, particularly in Italy but you know we'll be there in a matter of days or hours.

There's no money to be made when you're sending people hold to die.

Anyhow, the absolute cluster fuck this will surely be is likely to be one of the final nails in our for profit healthcare system. If they actually were able to handle the situation in a better fashion that most of the world they might be able to hold on. But that shit won't happen.

I'm not really taking advice from you. To be clear, I said you were an idiot IF you really believed that the health care industry has a profit motive to MAKE people sick.

Well, yes, you're supposed to live close enough to hospital, obviously.

Did those women really have absolutely zero health issues, from pregnancy all the way before that one last second? What's considered ""high risk"" for a hospital birth is very different for what's considered ""high risk"" for a home birth.

What was the complication in this case? You said bleeding, but postpartum hemorrhage certainly doesn't make a woman dead within 5 minutes, if that was the case, childbirth mortality would be so much higher, a lot of women experience it after being discharged from the hospital and need to be transported back.

Anyway, there are certainly *some* (very rare) cases where things can go very wrong extremely quickly , but in those cases even being in a hospital doesn't help.

2020-03-29,engineergorl,Coronavirus,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/fqkk56/daily_discussion_post_march_28_questions_images/fltku9a/,"It’s probably due to 
1. Already prevalent use of face masks to the point that it’s worn as fashion. I think it would help cut down on transmission from asymptomatic carriers of the virus. If I’m wrong, please correct me on this.
2. Government control. Most people in Asia will do what the government directs them to do. The collectivist culture and a history of authoritarian governments dating back thousands of years (like the Chinese dynasties) means people in Asia seem to trust in governmental authority more than, say, Americans do. Furthermore, in China for example, the government can literally do anything it wants like take your house and everything you own, so if the government tells you to do something, most people will do it. Not to mention the government has the power to force you to do something even if you don’t want to (see, welding people’s doors shut if they violate quarantine). 
3. The numbers for Asia except for South Korea not being entirely truthful. I do think China’s reported number of cases and deaths is vastly deflated. Even if China isn’t lying about its numbers, since China was the first country to have this, it makes sense that they missed a lot of people either due to not having enough tests or not knowing what it was initially. A lot of deaths were reported as pneumonia with an unknown cause. A lot of people stay home if they’re sick and even die at home, so if they never make it to a hospital, they’re not tested and counted in the statistics. 
4. History of outbreaks. The 2004 SARS outbreak is mentioned a lot because people in Asia still remember it. Part of the reason why Taiwan and South Korea was so successful in containing corona virus is because they went though this with SARS and learned lessons. 

China reported a lot of spreading within family before they started sending people to quarantine hospitals, which isn’t surprising because people, even non-family, dip their chopsticks into the same dishes at meals. Meals are usually structured like everyone has their own rice bowl, but everything else is in central dishes shared with everyone else that you take some food from and put in your rice bowl. So I don’t think it’s culture.
European healthcare is probably better than China’s. There’s a billion people in China. 

I think at the end of the day, places like Asia can impose harsher consequences for selfishness like spring breakers in Florida showed. So quarantine is easier to enforce, and they can flatten the curve."

Since they love to go outside, fast forward 3 weeks before it really hit us here in France I warned them to leave the class and go and stockpile food before everything is shut down even then they didn’t listen to me told me I was crazy the rate this thing is going at in 2 years it would of hit every country hard with around 5 to 10 million dead because people have to go outside for food:(.

Here's an honest question, unrelated to coronavirus: Do you intend to be a smoker for the rest of your life, until the day you die (hopefully decades from now)? If not, then you plan to stop eventually, at some point. So why not get it over with now, at the moment that quitting will give you the most benefit and is logistically easiest?

If you'll do it ""eventually"", it's a lot easier to start today. And it's one fewer things that you have to manage."

Your typical japanese salaryman are not the type to complain, trust me. That's ""The way to live"", the normality of overworking is a real culture shock for me.

On the other side, I've met many Gaijin like me, working in Japan and living the good life because a lot of companies want to adapt hours for Western peoples or theses guys work for foreign companies in Japan. I'm French and I've met a lot of Australian and Americans dudes, telling me that's is really cool and have plenty of time for family and having some good times.

I personally know some French going to Japan for the same thing : That's not so different than working in France, sometimes better. (Tbh I'm pretty jealous, i have an heavy health problem so i can't do the same. Sad because this country Rocks if you have a descent Job.)

But for native Japanese, that's another thing as i can see...Work work work and if you are sick AF, grab some caffeine drinks and work dude.

But I think one thing you said is right, that US should focus more on its own problem rather than bashing China, which your president is constantly doing. That really doesn't help with the situation, and vice versa, it harms US itself. By deflecting the responsibility and deliberately ignoring useful information from Chinese experts, the response to this crisis in US is so far just a disaster. China made a mistake by suppressing the information at the beginning, but they managed to contain it and now they are already recovering. I hope US people would learn from their mistake. From what I see so far, most of the politicians in US are too busy blaming each other and half assing on the actual actions. 

And, China doesn't hate USA. Don't believe everything your media tells you. However, it's safe to say Chinese people don't have a favorable opinion regarding with your president right now."

A list of things that contribute to this situation:

I wonder if there is a language issue here - lots of Americans are going to doctor offices, indent care clinics and hospitals. However, hospitals are largely seen as emergency centers for emergency procedures, or complex procedures requiring expensive equipment or specialized expertise. Urgent care centers and regular doctor offices are just fine for general health care and minor emergencies (like a broken arm). We typically will go to a dentist for something like tooth decay (this is a form of specialized care for teeth, so most people wouldn’t need to go to an emergency center). 

From my experience in my own city in America, lots of people are *trying* to go get tested if they have symptoms, but our healthcare facilities *for whatever reason* do not have the ability or capacity to accurately test for COVID-19, but this is changing each day. 

Americans tend to forget that health insurance being provided by your employer is a benefit or a form of compensation. Please ignore anything you see in our news about health insurance being “tied” to your job - that is not true. You are still free to purchase health insurance outside of your work, the same way that most people buy auto insurance separately, or renters insurance, or home insurance. A side effect of this is that if people lose their job, they typically do not have health insurance. If you purchase health insurance outside of your job, it will be *more expensive* because when an employer provides health insurance typically the employer subsidizes the cost of the health insurance (they may pay half the cost of the insurance or something). This causes two problems: people don’t understand the true cost of health insurance and people rely on their employer to provide health insurance. Both of these are very bad. 

A large reason some people (like me) are against nationalized health care is because it is being proposed as a *right* which is a *very special and sacred thing* in the United States. However, I very much support providing healthcare for everyone as long as we call it a privilege, like driving a car. 

>	do many Americans say ""you're bad because you're at your own risk”

Short answer: no. If you walk around and ask Americans this question we will mostly answer “no” because believe it or not, most Americans are compassionate people.

Longer answer: yes, kind of. To *massively over-simplify* i would say the US does not have nationalized healthcare or insurance, so it is *your responsibility* to manage your own health care options. This principal of personal responsibility is one of our core values as a nation (but it seems like we are wanting to abandon this value over the last 30 years). To manage your own healthcare means you buy insurance yourself, take a job that provides insurance, or pay for medical care out of your own pocket.

There are *lots*  of medical insurance assistance and welfare programs that provide coverage for very little money (it very much depends on where you live). But people do not take advantage of them. For example when I was younger my employer did not provide health insurance and I could not afford it by myself, but my city provided a medical insurance assistance program that was essentially very cheap medical insurance that I paid very little money for. Most people don’t do this. 

On top of all that, the American people are getting abused by our politicians and the healthcare/pharmaceutical/insurance companies.

It’s a total mess. everyone wants to improve the system, but we can’t agree how to do that and for some reason instead of solving this problem at the state level, we are trying to solve it at the national level."

A 14-year-old child died this Sunday morning at the Feira Hospital shortly after it was confirmed that he was infected with Covid-19.

The boy, who lived in Ovar, was admitted to São Sebastião Hospital on Saturday, without being signaled as infected with Covid-19. He presented severe symptoms compatible with the disease and was referred to the ward dedicated to patients infected with the new coronavirus.

Although the Feira hospital had no pediatric intensive care, and the cases were usually referred to Santo António, in Oporto, the medical team decided that the patient was at greater risk if transferred. The boy suffered from psoriasis, a disease which can weaken the immune system, according to a clinical source heard by JN.

Until recently their president was still downplaying (I think he still is to some extend), so it is not clear if they are testing extensively enough for such a massive population. With insufficient testing the sample of people they can base their results are only people that feel ill enough to go to hospital, and this is where the elevated severe counts come from. if mild people are not tested and they recover at home without reporting the illness these numbers will be counting only people who are ill enough to be hospitalized.

In Canada, midwifery is integrated with our hospitals and considered the best option for women who are low risk. A lot of complications in otherwise low risk births are a result of interventions in the first place. A team of midwives attend every homebirth and bring medkits which basically have all the same equipment they’d have at a hospital anyway. The only thing they can’t do is give you an epidural or c-section. It takes about 10-15 minutes for them to prep the OR anyway and if you live that close to a hospital, its not really much different.

No where in the study does it say that the  COVID-19 causing coronavirus was spreading to humans for decades. This is 100% made up by SCMP for propaganda purposes. In fact the study continues to imply that the Wuhan wet market continues to be the likely origin of the coronavirus which causes COVID-19. But it’s inconclusive on whether or not the virus mutated the ability to infect other humans before or after a cross species infection.  
 
The study also concludes that it is extremely unlikely that the coronavirus was made in a laboratory. No where does it state that the coronavirus we are dealing with now that causes covid-19 was secretly infecting people for decades! That is just desperate propaganda to deflect blame from the CCP.

The robots are coming

The time of social distancing is the greatest moment of robotics enthusiasts. The corona pandemic was a unique opportunity to get the development of medical robotics going, argued a dozen robotics in the editorial of the current issue of Science Robotics.

In fact, in the fight against the spread of the corona virus, many areas became visible in which the robots should not only support us humans - as previously desired - but should completely replace them. For example, there is the disinfection of contaminated rooms, the delivery of medication and food, the measurement of vital signs, the implementation of border controls and the monitoring of curfews.

Apart from these very ethically sensitive areas, the corona crisis will massively accelerate the automation of many industries. This includes autonomous driving, food preparation in the catering trade and delivery services.

The fully automated society is the promise of a contactless everyday life. And this scenario has just lost some of its horror. (Olivera Stajic)

&#x200B;

Division of labor remains unfair

Would it have been possible to quickly close kindergartens and schools if women and men worked full-time? Hardly, especially because of unpaid work and part-time jobs for women.

The consequences - economic dependence or low pensions - are well known. This also applies to the many women in the care sector and in retail. What does the current tangible relevance of this poorly paid work mean? And: is the forced break imposed on many full-time workers an opportunity for a fairer division of labor?

A study showed that the possibility of home office for both parents does not change the distribution of family work. And after the Ebola crisis, men's incomes recovered faster than those of women.

Political scientist Birgit Sauer is worried about the previously announced austerity package for Austria, which could be at the expense of social and health policy. Economist Katharina Mader warns that the new reserve army of unemployed people could generate wage pressure. Unpaid and underpaid work will therefore certainly not experience any appreciation. (Beate Hausbichler)

&#x200B;

Déjà-vu in the euro area

The signs are thickening: the corona pandemic will lead to a new edition of the euro crisis. Bologna-based Prometeia estimates that Italy's economy will plunge 6.5 percent this year. Public debt is likely to rise from 136 percent to 150 percent of economic output due to the Corona crisis.

Even before Corona, Italy was a shaky candidate: the country's indebtedness only did not tip thanks to a certain Italian budget discipline and because the European Central Bank bought Italian promissories in large quantities on the market and thus kept interest rates low for Rome.

This balance has destroyed Corona. One possibility would be to give Italy emergency loans through the ESM euro bailout fund. Rome would have to accept restrictions. An alternative: The eurozone is beginning to go into debt together, keyword corona bonds. Such a process would be slow to implement legally. The fight for the eurozone will begin again by 2021 at the latest. (András Szigetvari)

&#x200B;

Two options for the climate

Air traffic has largely ceased, and car traffic in some European cities has decreased by up to 80 percent. In addition, there is a decrease in industrial emissions and a decrease in production-related energy consumption.

Within a few days, due to the corona pandemic, what scientists have been preaching for decades has been happening worldwide: we have to blow fewer greenhouse gases into the air to stem global warming.

Nevertheless, global greenhouse gas emissions are at an all-time high, and the pandemic is likely to leave only a small dent in the statistics. It will be exciting to see how climate policy will change after the disease has been contained.

There are two options: Either states act short-sightedly and pump money that was previously intended for climate protection into the economy without environmental requirements. Or: Politicians act farsightedly and integrate climate protection into every rescue package. Because the pandemic will pass, the climate crisis will remain. (Nora Laufer)

&#x200B;

Deceleration when traveling

Freedom of travel has never been so restricted. The borders are tight, the first airlines are going bankrupt. Good news for the climate, cynics will say. But will travel activity remain low in the long term?

The futurologist and tourism researcher Horst Opaschowski contradicts: ""Without traveling, we face withdrawal symptoms. We were mobile before we settled down,"" he says. The researcher has experienced the oil crisis, Chernobyl and the September 11 attacks - and has studied for 30 years how crises affect travel behavior. His finding: ""It was always said: nothing will be the way it was. But that was never true.""

Opaschowski sees travel as the most popular form of happiness. And that's just a bird at the moment. In the future it will land with other, new airlines. Some predictions by his guild colleagues appear abstruse: The business class would benefit enormously - because of the larger seat and thus safety distance from potential virus carriers, you see in the crystal ball.

Opaschowski has another guess, which pulls us into the distance. The driving force behind mobility and travel is the fear of missing something in life. We're missing a lot right now. Isolation also leads to deceleration, which harbors reassessments. And the chance to travel more meaningfully soon.

Only some of them will use the services of the start-up that DER STANDARD recently portrayed: Traveling offers train connections worldwide that no railway company can do. For this, the Viennese have obtained considerable funding in the crisis. (Sascha Aumüller)

Electronic dialing for everyone 

One of the first victims of the corona virus were conventional voting methods: This is how Joe Brotherton, the chairman of the US company Democracy Live, which enables electronic voting, describes it in the US newspaper Politico. Five states in the US canceled the presidential primaries when the corona virus broke out. In Austria, Vorarlberg and Styria canceled their municipal elections.

That should not be the case, since Estonia, for example, has been voting online at all levels since 2009. In this country, however, elections remain a purely offline matter: they take place in the polling station or by postal vote. So far, many have believed that digital voting is unstoppable.

Arguments that would have always spoken against it were dropped in the current crisis, says Ursula Maier-Rabler, who conducts research on e-democracy at the Institute for Communication Science at the University of Salzburg: The digital competence of citizens will automatically increase, network connections better if Households would have to go online. However, some security concerns remain.

Michael Butz, managing director of A-Trust, a company that offers technical infrastructure for the mobile phone signature, is currently observing a ""total run"". Authorities can be dealt with online using a cell phone signature, people's petitions and documents digitally signed.

Erich Schweighofer, legal IT specialist at the University of Vienna, advocates that parliaments use digital opportunities to remain functional: ""The tools of e-voting and forms of participation are part of it and should be standard, but it is not."" (Anna Giulia Fink, March 29, 2020)"
