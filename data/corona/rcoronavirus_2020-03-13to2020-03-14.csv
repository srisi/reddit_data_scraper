Between 160 million and 214 million people in the U.S. could be infected (Worst case scenario). Dr. Lawler, an infectious diseases specialist, provided a “best guess” projections of 96 million people

Could last months or even over a year

As many as 200,000 to 1.7 million people could die. Dr. Lawler’s calculations: 480,000 deaths, which he said was conservative

By contrast, 20,000 to 50,000 people have died from flu-related illnesses this season according to CDC.

2.4 million to 21 million people in the U.S. could require hospitalization, potentially crushing the nation’s medical system, which has only about 925,000 staffed hospital beds. Fewer than a tenth of those are for people who are critically ill

Just two or three days ago, the men and women who came to these services for respiratory distress were mainly frail, elderly and already sick people.  Now, they are no longer the only ones.  ""It is no longer rare to see young people aged 30 or 40, without pathology,"" says Gilles Pialoux.  This is the reality on the ground.  The circle widens.  ""

 As proof, 86% of patients who died from the flu in France between 2011 and 2019 were over 75 years old, compared to 50% for the deaths of Covid-19 in China.  Joined, Catherine (the first name has been changed), a nurse in a hospital, confirms: “We have young people, with no medical history, in very serious condition.  
In his televised address this Thursday evening, Emmanuel Macron said: ""We must prepare for a second wave that will affect, a little later, younger people who are a priori less exposed to the disease but who will also need to be treated. “How to explain it?

I’m kinda bugging out because I’ve heard that the symptoms might not show up for a few days, so I could have it right now without symptoms. I’m throwing my sister a bridal shower on Sunday with 25 people. My family lives in Northern NJ and is farther away from the city, they don’t think it’s a big deal. I didn’t think it was a big deal either until I came in contact with people that were sick, that is when it started to freak me out. 
Also, my boyfriend is a union carpenter still going to work and thinks I’m overreacting. All of those carpenters are “tough guys” and are laughing about this virus. I’m worried he’s gonna bring it home, that is if I don’t already have it/gave it to him.

If you have a temperature you're taken to a fever clinic (NOT a hospital, to keep the hospitals safer and save their capacity). At the fever clinic you get a scan from a portable CT scanner. If you have ground-glass opacity in the lungs you get a PCR swab test for the virus. If you're sick you go to the hospital. If you're not sick but have the virus you get sent to a gym to wait for your quarantine to be over so you don't infect your family. Apparently the fever clinics were set up during the SARS outbreak, and they took them out of mothballs for this crisis.

I can see past a lot of shit, I can put my bias aside when needed, and I know how to accept that sometimes I'm wrong about shit.

In this specific situation he put peoples lives at risk and he's set us back from a tremendous pace would could have been keeping on minimizing the damage this virus does to our population, but he CHOSE not to do it.

He's earned every single bit of criticism he's getting over this, except maybe the brunt of the economy criticism because the virus and the issues going on overseas over oil aren't something he caused. But even then we could have been more prepared for it, which again I don't put fully in his lap.

But our response to the virus, the no testing, the classification of their discussions over something effecting us so deeply, the destorying of the CDC group responsible for this kind of thing, his ho humph attitude over it being a hoax and telling people not to worry about it?

He bought and payed for all that himself. Pretty much all of the criticism Trump gets is earned, he does stupid shit for someone who's supposed to be smart enough to lead the free world.

If you're gonna stick up for him stick to the economy stuff, because this virus situation was a huge cockup and it's still going on so your comment is already aged poorly.

Look at Canada, an almost perfect example of how he didn't handle our situation and their leader did. It's almost a perfect contrast."
