If you feel sick, in any way, or have someone who is sick at home, you can take off unpaid. You will not get any points/infractions for it, and you don’t need a doctors note. You can even leave early from a shift and not have it counted against you.

If you get coronavirus, and are tested positive, you get two weeks off as well as two weeks pay at full time.

You are ABLE to work up to 60 hours a week now to offset the people who are sick, you are not in any way, shape or form REQUIRED to.

Everybody in the U.S. was given a $2 raise as well, raising minimum wage to $17.50 during this time.

If you are heavily afflicted due to multiple people being ill in your household, or having to take care of sick family and not being able to work for a long period of time, you can apply for the Amazon Relief Fund, which will reward you based on your hardship from a minimum of $400, up to $5000.

The work place has hand sanitizing stations set up 50 feet apart, people have to be at least 6 feet from one another, gloves are required, breaks are staggered so no more than a couple dozen people are in close proximity to each other in the break room to mitigate spread.

I don’t like shitty big corporations as much as the next guy, but they are doing a LOT to provide a safe workplace for those who can/want to work, and providing a financial support for those who do catch the virus. I know Jeff Bezos isn’t the best guy, but there are companies actually not doing shit. Doing all of this is actually HURTING them, because only 50% of the people are showing up for their scheduled shifts.

If you want proof of me being an Amazon employee I can send a picture of my ID and the warehouse, as well as posted notices that back up my claims.

Extra: Also, Amazon recently just moved 80% of their UPS contracts in house, raising the amount of packages we have to process by some 50%. We are not hitting delivery goals, but we are still taking the hit because safety is ALWAYS 1st. We have old people who work here and we care enough as a company to make sure everybody is as safe as possible given the circumstances.

Even MORE extra: In addition to all of these above, people who do attend are entered into daily raffles where people win prizes just for clocking in as an extra bonus for working. We have given away over $3,500 in prizes this week, including 2 55"" TV's, 4 Echos, 4 Fire tablets, & 4 Beats headphones (don't know the model). They do already do this from time to time, but this time its in response to the coronavirus to reward people for working and boost morale.

Edit: Raise is $2, not $2.50, read the figures wrong. Fixed wording also.

Edit 2: Obligatory thanks for the awards. But really, thanks! It got this post higher than I thought it would go. 

Edit 3: Not here to talk overall politics or ethics for the company I work for, just the issue at hand."

A few days ago I shared wine, cheese, and camaraderie with a small group of close friends, and sadly, after five excellent bottles of Côtes du Rhône wine, we said goodbye to one another, knowing we shall not again share company for many weeks, perhaps months. Yesterday my dearest neighbors knocked on the door, carts loaded with suitcases and boxes in tow, to wish me well for the duration of the great pandemic. We air-hugged, and I sadly watched them tromp off to their packed vehicle, abandoning New York City for their country home. As they wandered off, I said, “See you in September, I hope—or whenever things are normal again.”

For some countries—Italy, South Korea, and Singapore for example—the moment of decision and personal preparation has long since passed, and millions of people are stuck in place, watching their epidemic unfold. On the eve of St. Patrick’s Day, the mayor of San Francisco ordered her entire population to “shelter in place” for a few weeks: The window of opportunity to relocate has closed for residents of the Bay Area.

Whether you are reading this in your living room in Vancouver, office in London, or on a subway in New York City, you need to think hard, and fast, about two crucial questions: Where, and with whom, do you want to spend the next six to 12 weeks of your life, hunkered down for the epidemic duration? And what can you do to make that place as safe as possible for yourself and those around you?

Your time to answer those questions is very short—a few days, at most. Airports will close, trains will shut down, gasoline supplies may dwindle, and roadblocks may be set up. Nations are closing their borders, and as the numbers of sick rise, towns, suburbs, even entire counties will try to shut the virus out by blocking travel. Wherever you decide to settle down this week is likely to be the place in which you will be stuck for the duration of your epidemic.

To appreciate what lies ahead for the United States, Canada, Mexico, and the United Kingdom, pay heed to Italy, France, and Germany. The United States, for example, is currently tracking exactly where Italy was about 10 days ago. France and Germany, which track two to five days ahead of the United States, are now revving up measures akin to those taken by Italy, including lockdowns on movement and social activity. In a matter of days, the United States will follow suit.

If you live alone, have no family members or close friends who require your special attention, and have no alternative living space, you have no decision to make. You are where you will be for coming weeks.

Many households are now swelling as colleges and universities close, sending students to their parents’ homes, and young adults find themselves facing financial ruin amid the shutdown of theaters, restaurants, gig economy work, construction sites, and other forms of employment lacking job protection and home leave assistance. These young adults may also choose to return to their parents’ homes, or to secondary residences owned by friends or relatives.

As employers shift to work-from-home status, white-collar workers with salaried jobs need to consider where best to hunker down, allowing them strong Internet access and a home work setting. For workers whose jobs require physical presence at a work site, such as custodians, factory workers, security guards, construction personnel, taxi drivers, and the like, the relocation option is decided—stay put. But many may lose their jobs, either temporarily or permanently, due to the epidemic, and the prospect of six to eight weeks without an income stream is excruciating. Anybody facing that prospect should immediately negotiate with their landlords, mortgage lenders, and utilities, seeking long-term payment options, and scour for information regarding their legal rights if threatened with eviction, power shut-off, or lost credit due to epidemic-spawned nonpayment.

Because elderly people, particularly those with underlying medical conditions, are at special risk for severe reactions to COVID-19, including death, many families are making choices to move closer to their aged loved ones, or bring them to live with their adult children and grandchildren. These can be painful decisions, particularly if the elder’s health requires daily attention or features dementia. As the epidemic worsens, it will become increasingly dangerous for such elders to travel: Tough choices must be made immediately.

Once tough location decisions have been made, the household must be readied for a long siege. While panic-buying has led to stockpiles of toilet paper and hand sanitizer, getting through eight months of confinement with others will require a great deal more, both physically and psychologically. This is especially true for households that span generations.

Long-term confinement that includes children undergoing remote schooling and adults trying to work requires designated spaces for each individual, a powerful Internet signal and Wi-Fi router, and a great deal of shared patience. Everybody in the household must understand how the coronavirus is spread, and what steps each should follow to eliminate their personal risk of passing infection to others in the home.

The virus is transmitted by droplets and fomites—it isn’t like measles, capable of drifting about in the air for hours. It dehydrates quickly if not inside water, mucus, or fomite droplets. The size of the droplets may be far below what the human eye can see, but they are gravity-sensitive, and will fall from an individual’s mouth down, eventually, to the nearest lower surface—table, desk, floor. You do not need to clean upward.

However, a newly published study, backed by the National Institutes of Health, found that the virus survives in “aerosols for up to three hours, up to four hours on copper, up to 24 hours on cardboard and up to two to three days on plastic and stainless steel.” This means an uncleaned surface can pose a risk to members of the household for a very long time—a doorknob, tabletop, kitchen counter or stainless steel utensil.

Both the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and Occupational Safety and Health Administration have posted cleaning guidelines, indicating which simple, inexpensive products can eliminate the coronavirus from surfaces in your household or work areas. Give special attention to the most commonly shared surfaces in your home or work area: door knobs, light switches, phones, faucets, toilet handles, kitchen utensils, computer keyboards, and remote controls.

The virus is killed by ultraviolet sunlight, and air flow will hasten dehydration. Do not create air flow by turning on building central air systems—you will spread contamination. If there are windows, open them wide and leave them open whenever weather conditions allow. If there are curtains or shades, open them and let sunlight pour in.

If available, wear latex or heavy-duty dishwashing gloves while cleaning anything that an individual suspected to be infected with COVID-19 has had contact with. Place all used gloves and other disposable contaminated items in a bag that can be tied closed before disposing of them with other waste. Wash hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds immediately after removing gloves.

If you live in an apartment, condominium, or co-housing facility, ask management to post signs limiting the number of people allowed to share an elevator to however many can fit in the cars while maintaining a distance of three feet from one another. Elevator buttons should be cleaned regularly. Deliveries should be left in a common area, such as the building lobby, rather than having outsiders use the elevators and knock on household doors.

And all residents should be asked to please be mindful of contagion courtesy, covering mouths when coughing or sneezing and teaching children to do the same. After coughing or sneezing into hands, do not touch public surfaces in the building such as elevator buttons, banisters, and door handles.

It’s also important to prepare psychologically. Every family or couple has its issues, and tensions can amplify during long confinement. Common sense can ease the shared suffering.

If children are undergoing remote schooling, and parents are simultaneously working remotely, everybody needs headphones, plenty of computer bandwidth, and a designated workspace. Before stores close, make sure every user has proper cables, headphones, batteries, adapters, and other tools of the computer trade.

Printers, if they will be used, require paper and ink: Have plenty on hand.

Everybody needs routines, including exercise and recreation. Shared burdens of cooking and cleaning should be offset by shared play and fun.

Boredom and stress can suck the lifeblood out of a person. Before your home goes on lockdown, make sure your download accounts for movies and television are paid. There are plenty of good books around the house, and games and decks of cards are handy.

Plan now for your state of siege. Don’t delay. Choose where you want to survive the pandemic, with whom, and how. Your window of opportunity to act is shrinking, very fast."

I hadn't heard about this, so I looked into it. For anyone curious, they used a simple online registry and regional text messages to notify people that may have been exposed. The Washington Post wrote a [good article](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/asia_pacific/coronavirus-south-korea-tracking-apps/2020/03/13/2bed568e-5fac-11ea-ac50-18701e14e06d_story.html) about it.

It seems like we could take it a step further and create an app that allows users to track their movements (local storage only) and then upload 7-14 days of anonymized time/place data to an online registry when they test positive. The same app could then check the user's local time/place records for overlaps with the online registry to determine if they crossed paths with an infected individual and let them know they're at a heightened risk."

This is pretty much what the UK has settled for.

It'll take a good while, maybe a year or two, to come up with a vaccine that will basically do exactly what this mum suggests just without the risk to vulnerable groups.

March 18, 2020, 9:26 p.m. ET

Grace Fusco — mother of 11, grandmother of 27 — would sit in the same pew at church each Sunday, surrounded by nearly a dozen members of her sprawling Italian-American family. Sunday dinners drew an even larger crowd to her home in central New Jersey.
Now, her close-knit clan is united anew by unspeakable grief: Mrs. Fusco, 73, and four of her children are hospitalized with coronavirus. Two children who contracted the virus have died in the last week.
Mrs. Fusco’s eldest child, Rita Fusco-Jackson, 55, of Freehold, N.J., died Friday with the virus, a relative said. Her eldest son, Carmine Fusco, of Bath, Pa., died on Wednesday, said the relative, Roseann Paradiso Fodera.
Three of the four siblings who remain hospitalized are in critical condition, Ms. Paradiso Fodera said.

Mrs. Fusco, of Freehold, is “gravely ill” and breathing with help from a ventilator, said Ms. Paradiso Fodera, a lawyer who is Mrs. Fusco’s cousin and is serving as a family spokeswoman.
“My cousin Grace doesn’t realize her two oldest children have passed,” she said.

Nearly 20 other relatives are quarantined at their homes, praying in isolated solitude, unable to mourn their deep collective loss together.

“If they’re not on a respirator, they’re quarantined,” Ms. Paradiso Fodera said.
“It is so pitiful,” she added. “They can’t even mourn the way you would.”

As of Wednesday afternoon, five New Jersey residents had died after contracting the virus, which has infected at least 427 people statewide. Nationwide, at least 7,047 people across every state, plus Washington, D.C., and three U.S. territories, have tested positive for coronavirus, and at least 121 have died, according to a New York Times database.

But the virus’s devastating toll on a single family is considered as rare as it is perplexing.
“They’re young and they don’t have any underlying conditions,” Ms. Paradiso Fodero said.

Mrs. Fusco and four of her children are being treated at CentraState Medical Center in Freehold, about an hour south of Manhattan, relatives said. Mr. Fusco died at a Pennsylvania hospital near his home, Ms. Paradiso Fodera said.

The family has deep ties to the horse-racing industry near Freehold Raceway. Some trained horses. Others raced them. The children’s father, Vincenzo L. Fusco, did both, according to his obituary.
A person who had contact with a man who died in New Jersey on March 10, becoming the state’s first coronavirus-related fatality, had attended a recent Fusco family gathering, the state’s health commissioner, Judith M. Persichilli, has said.
The first New Jersey man to die has been identified by a close friend and the harness track where he worked, Yonkers Raceway, as John Brennan.
Ms. Paradiso Fodera said the gathering was a routine Tuesday dinner.
“A party to most people was a regular dinner to them,” she said before counting names on a family tree that listed 27 grandchildren.

The gathering is believed to be the source of the virus, and information about the number of people infected there led to a new intensity in Ms. Persichilli’s warnings over the weekend against even small get-togethers with friends or relatives.
“I cannot emphasize enough how important it is to take personal responsibility and to avoid even small gatherings,” Ms. Persichilli said during a press briefing on Sunday.

Dr. James Matera, chief medical officer of CentraState Medical Center, said he had discussed the uniqueness of treating so many members of the same family with the state’s health commissioner and officials at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

He said officials are in the process of evaluating the patients’ medical histories to look for clues about why the disease might have progressed so rapidly, and been so potent.
“I don’t know if it’s a strain thing,” Dr. Matera said. “I would consider these particular people to be unusual.”
Ms. Fusco-Jackson died a day before her test for coronavirus came back positive on Saturday evening.

Her relatives are urging officials at CentraState or the C.D.C. to conduct an autopsy to learn more about how the virus killed Ms. Fusco-Jackson. She had been in good health, they said, and taught religious education classes at the Roman Catholic church where many members of the large extended family worshiped, St. Robert Bellarmine in Freehold.

Ms. Fusco-Jackson, a mother of three, also sang in the choir, coordinated parish weddings and volunteered in the church’s gardening club, the pastor, Msgr. Sam Sirianni, said.
She had attended a retreat for students preparing for the sacrament of confirmation on Feb. 29, but her contact with participants was minimal, the church said on Facebook.
“I can’t tell you enough about her,” Monsignor Sirianni said on Wednesday in an interview. “She was always willing to assist and to lead.”
The family was among the founding members of the church, he added.
“Until this virus came, they were still the family that would gather for Sunday dinner,” Monsignor Sirianni said. “If grandma was there, everybody came.”

The church has since been deep-cleaned, and Monsignor Sirianni, like all members of the parish staff, is operating under quarantine based on possible exposure.
“It means I turn to the Lord even more,” Monsignor Sirianni said. “What came to mind last week was. ‘Lord save your people.’ And that’s been one of my mantras when I go to pray.”

He said he was struggling to come to terms with being unable to visit the sick at CentraState.
In addition to those who have tested positive for coronavirus at CentraState, a midsize hospital that operates as a nonprofit, 27 community members who have been tested for the virus but are awaiting results are hospitalized under observation, Dr. Matera said on Wednesday.
He said the lengthy turnaround time for test results leaves patients in the dark and burdens the hospital’s limited resources. Patients who might ultimately test negative for coronavirus, and be healthy enough to leave the hospital, are instead being kept in isolation.

If tests were returned more quickly, more patients could be discharged.
“That opens up beds,” Dr. Matera said. “It lowers the anxiety of the staff.”
Ms. Fusco-Jackson’s relatives also believe that speedier test results could have made a difference in her care.
“They didn’t treat her as a confirmed case because everything is so delayed,” Ms. Paradiso Fodera said. “It’s a big bureaucracy. The testing result time is important.”"
2020-03-18,Bbrhuft,science,56,https://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/fkuv5d/a_new_study_published_in_the_journal_pediatrics/fkw0p79/,"The article title is misleading, as the paper did not say which direction the infections were, that was an interpretation of the Washington Post, not the paper. All it says was that children were involved in human to human spread of the virus, that could be from parent to child.

Children, by virtue of having milder illness and less commonly infected are unlikely to be a major factor in spreading the virus, only 1.3% of infections in Italy and <2% of infections in China involve children <19 years.

This from Japan.

>What   our short analysis shows is that children are less likely to be   diagnosed as cases, and moreover, the risk of disease given exposure   among children appears to be low. Both the overall risk and the   conditional risk of disease given exposure are likely to be the highest   among adults aged from 50-69 years.

They're saying fewer children have Covid-19 and they are less likely to catch the disease if exposed. It is likely, in Japan, that most of the epidemic is spread by adults, 50-69 years.

And

>The   finding contradicts other widely circulating respiratory viral   infections, e.g. seasonal influenza and respiratory syncytial virus   infection, to which children are known to act as the focal host of   transmission.

Children are important in spreading Flu, that's not true for Covid-19.

The article about the paper OP posted on says nothing about the direction of infection, in  fact Dr. Bruce Aylward (head of the WHO team that visited China) said  the Chinese found very very few cases of a child infecting an adult, it  was almost always the other way around.

Over the course of tonight's AEW Dynamite episode, graphics for future bouts were listed for the ""Next Dynamite"" as opposed to next week.   That led to PWInsider.com reader questions about whether the show was going on hiatus.  

That is, as of this writing, not the case.  We are told that currently, AEW is still scheduled to broadcast live on TNT.

However, the decision was made to list everything for the ""next"" Dynamite instead of next week because the company, from owner Tony Khan on down, is taking the stance that no one should be taking anything for granted during these tumultuous times and they did not want to come across as if anything was guaranteed.  The team wanted to get through tonight's episode and as one source stated after the show, ""not be so arrogant as to assume"" they'll 100% be allowed back on live TV next week, since things are changing so rapidly due to the Coronavirus outbreak.

If AEW can broadcast live next Wednesday, everything that was announced tonight will take place as listed.  If something unforeseen happens (and after the last seven days, unforeseen appears to be the way of the world), AEW will pick up where they left off as soon as they are allowed to do so.

The company is very excited about the additions of Matt Hardy and Brody Lee. 

AEW already has the next episode mapped out with Matt Hardy joining Team Elite as they build towards the Blood and Guts match."

Full name of the virus causing this pandemic is actually SARS-CoV-2 because the SARS epidemic was caused by SARS-CoV-1. SARS-1 was a lot more lethal, but far fewer people got sick (8098 cases total and it never really got out of China). MERS was similar in that it was more lethal but less contagious than the current disease.

The current disease is that nasty, nasty combination of lethal enough to be concerning, and contagious enough that severe measures are needed to slow the spread. If it were like Ebola or SARS or MERS, it wouldn't have a chance of widespread infection like this one does. The hope here is that with an aggressive response, we can prevent this disease from becoming as widespread as the seasonal flu (unchecked, it would probably be MORE widespread due to the lack of a vaccine and possibly being a bit more contagious). If allowed to become as widespread as seasonal flu, we'd be looking at tens to hundreds of thousands of deaths in the US alone. Evidence for the need of distancing could be found by looking at the experience in Wuhan; they waited too long and have hit >80000 cases. Imagine how bad it would have gotten if they HADN'T locked down ever.

Basically, we are getting front-row seats to a stress test of our public health infrastructure. Frankly, I'm just glad we're doing that test on a comparatively benign disease. If this were as deadly as the 1918 spanish flue turned out to be...I really hope we learn from the mistakes and flops of this so we can be better prepared the next time this happens."

To answer your question, I have communicated with and read the testimonials of individuals who have or had the virus, and frankly, the disease itself is wildly less formidable than many in the media would have you believe. For the average individual who has contracted Coronavirus, the experience is somewhere along the lines of sitting around the house with flu symptoms for a week while drinking Gatorade, and then you’re pretty much good. I would of course clarify that for those with immunodeficiency, such as an elderly person, the experience is entirely different and is obviously much more life threatening. Needless to say, I harbor great concern for those aside from myself who might be susceptible to the disease, seeing as I am personally at no great risk.

As far as the statistics are concerned, it should be noted that the seeming deadliness of Coronavirus suggested by the current death to contraction ratio is far greater than in all likelihood it actually is. I say this because there is presumably an enormous number of people that have already acquired Coronavirus, but the symptoms are so small or insignificant and pose so little a health risk that they have either not taken the steps to be tested or have not even recognized those symptoms within themselves. As such, it is likely that only those most susceptible to extreme cases (and subsequently, those most likely to succumb to the virus) have been submitted into treatment, and therefore are inevitably the only ones being factored into the data we are presented.

Finally, I believe that all of the appropriate government and social measures have been taken or are in the process of being implemented (such as the dissipation of large gatherings, the cancellation of school, etc.) that minimize the Coronavirus’ most dangerous characteristic, infectivity. It’s an additional comfort to know that a vaccine is well on the way.

All in all, I do not deny the threat that the disease poses to older individuals with previous health conditions is extreme; however, to the average person the Coronavirus is at worst a nasty, extremely viral cold. Therefore, you’ll have to excuse me if I don’t immediately buy into the ‘apocalyptic pandemic’ rhetoric. I’m relatively confident that I, like the vast majority of people, will emerge from the panic surrounding the outbreak alive and well."

Yes, the virus came from China, and the Chinese government's initial response was terrible and should be criticized, but people are dumb and have shown they can't differentiate between a country's government and its people. 

I've already seen people use the virus as an excuse to joke about how gross and dirty Chinese people is, and it's really troubling how no one seems to bat an eye at it. It's also incredibly ignorant, considering how most Chinese people don't eat things like that, there's ""weird"" food in every country including America, and the conditions in American farms/slaughterhouses are pretty nasty too. People have gotten sick and died from   unsanitary food prep conditions in the US (Jack in the box, Chipotle...) 

Seeing all the online comments about Chinese people the past few weeks has frustrated me. It's made realize how racism against Asians isn't taken seriously, it's always defended somehow. It's just a joke, you guys do well in life, Asian stereotypes are positive so why get upset, etc. No one seems to remember the Japanese internment camps or the Chinese exclusion act, which was repealed less than 100 years ago.

——————

From an immunologist at Johns Hopkins University:

Feeling confused as to why Coronavirus is a bigger deal than Seasonal flu?  Here it is in a nutshell.

It has to do with RNA sequencing, i.e. genetics.

Seasonal flu is an “all human virus”.  The DNA/RNA chains that make up the virus are recognized by the human immune system.  This means that your body has some immunity to it before it comes around each year...  you get immunity two ways...through exposure to a virus, or by getting a flu shot. 

Novel viruses, come from ANIMALS....the WHO (World Health Organization) tracks novel viruses in animals, (sometimes for years watching for mutations). Usually these viruses only transfer from animal to animal (pigs in the case of H1N1) (birds in the case of the Spanish flu).  But once one of these animal viruses mutates, and starts to transfer from animals to humans... then it’s a problem. Why? Because we have no natural or acquired immunity. The RNA sequencing of the genes inside the virus isn’t human, and the human immune system doesn’t recognize it so, we can’t fight it off.

Now sometimes, the mutation only allows transfer from animal to human. For years it’s only transmission is from an infected animal to a human, before it finally mutates so that it can now transfer human to human. Once that happens, we have a new contagion phase.  And depending on the fashion of this new mutation, that’s what decides how contagious, or how deadly it’s gonna be.

H1N1 was deadly, but it did not mutate in a way that was as deadly as the Spanish flu. Its RNA was slower to mutate and it attacked its host differently too. 

Fast forward.

Now, here comes this Coronavirus... it existed in animals only, for nobody knows how long...but one day it mutated and made the jump from ANIMAL TO PEOPLE.  At first, only animals could give it to a person... But here is the scary part.... in just TWO WEEKS it mutated AGAIN and gained the ability to jump from human to human.   Scientists call this quick ability, “slippery”

This Coronavirus, not being in any form a “human” virus (whereas we would all have some natural or acquired immunity), took off like a rocket! And this was because humans have no known immunity...doctors have no known medicines for it.

And it just so happens that this particular mutated animal virus changed itself in such a way that it causes great damage to human lungs.

That’s why Coronavirus is different from seasonal flu, or H1N1 or any other type of influenza.... this one is slippery AF. And it’s a lung eater... And, it’s already mutated AGAIN, so that we now have two strains to deal with, strain S, and strain L....which makes it twice as hard to develop a vaccine.

We really have no tools in our shed with this.  History has shown that fast and immediate closings of public places has helped in the past pandemics. Philadelphia and Baltimore were reluctant to close events in 1918 and they were the hardest hit in the US during the Spanish Flu.

And let me end by saying....right now it’s hitting older folks harder... but this genome is so slippery...if it mutates again (and it will). Who is to say, what it will do next.

Be smart folks...  acting like you’re unafraid is so not sexy right now, and frankly stupid and selfish.

Stay home folks...  and share this to those that just are not catching on."

All the risks you talk about are real but you are amplifying them massively. Humans don't do well in the grey zone of probabilities that are too rare for them to experience personally but too common to ignore as threats. This is why we speed, drink drive, smoke etc., even though all those things are horrendously risky. Coronavirus is sitting exactly in that spectrum at the moment and because people can't conceptualise probabilities like that everyone is making personal decisions that push it one way or the other - to extreme panic (empty the supermarket shelf) or ignoring it - (if only 1000 people in Australia have it, how can it affect me)?

Risks in the grey zone need to be managed. Accept they exist, identify the extremes - and mitigate them, practice good safety measures and then go on with life."

[link]

(2) China's new cases plummet: China has now closed down its last temporary hospital built to handle COVID-19. Not enough new cases to warrant them. [link]

(3) Drugs that work: Doctors in India have successfully treated two Italian patients with COVID-19, administering a combination of drugs — principally Lopinavir and Ritonavir, alongside Oseltamivir and Chloroquine. Several are now suggesting the same medical treatment, on a case-by-case basis, globally. [link] [link]

(4) Antibodies to the rescue: Researchers at the Erasmus Medical Center claim to have found an antibody that can fend off infection by COVID-19. [link]

(5) 103-year-old recovery: A 103-year-old Chinese woman has made a full recovery from COVID-19 after being treated for 6 days in Wuhan, China, becoming the oldest patient to beat the disease. [link]

(6) Stores re-opening: Apple has reopened all 42 of its Apple retail stores in China. [link]

(7) Test results in 2 hours: Cleveland’s MetroHealth Medical Center has developed a COVID-19 test that can now deliver results in just two hours, rather than in a matter of days. [link]

(8) South Korea's dramatic drop in new cases: After its peak of 909 newly reported COVID-19 cases on February 29th, South Korea has now seen a dramatic drop in the number of new cases reported daily. [link]

(9) Mortality rates inflated? Experts predict that Italy has seen a higher mortality rate of COVID-19 given its significant aging population, as well as its higher percentage of COVID-19 patients with pre-existing health conditions. This might suggest that COVID-19’s fatality rate may have been slightly more inflated than previously thought for the general population. [link]

(10) Israeli vaccine development: More than 50 scientists in Israel are now working to develop a vaccine and antibody for COVID-19, having reported significant breakthroughs in understanding the biological mechanism and characteristics of the novel coronavirus. [link]

(11) Full recoveries: Three patients in Maryland who tested positive for COVID-19 have now been reported to have “fully recovered.” [link]

(12) Isolated virus: A network of Canadian scientists isolated the COVID-19 virus, which can now be replicated to test diagnostics, treatments, and vaccines. [link]

(13) Yet another vaccine in the works: San Diego biotech company Arcturus Therapeutics is developing a COVID-19 vaccine in collaboration with Duke University and National University of Singapore. [link]

(14) Treatment protocols: Seven patients who were treated for COVID-19 at Jaipur’s Sawai Man Singh (SFS) Hospital and Delhi’s Safdarjung Hospital in India have recovered. The treatment protocol will be widely scaled to other hospitals. [link]

(15) Another treatment: Plasma from newly recovered COVID-19 patients (involving the harvesting of virus-fighting antibodies) holds promise for treating others infected by the virus. [link]

Some of COVID-19’s hardest hit nation victims are already emerging strong after peak infection, and biomedical innovators are tackling the virus at unprecedented speeds.

IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER… While everyone is concerned about the super-high mortality rate of this virus — which is calculated by the “number dead” divided by “the number who have tested positive” (currently ~8,000/200,000) — the denominator, i.e. the number infected is actually VERY hard to know because so few people have been tested.

It may well be that 10x more are infected but subclinical. So is the mortality rate 4% or 0.4%?

We will find out as large scale-testing comes reliably online.

Wishing you the best. Remember that our most important tool during times of panic and crisis is our mindset."

I’ve never witnessed such a pathetic, sniveling, weak showing. Such a desperate craving for authoritarian police crackdowns towards any citizen daring to attend a party or public space. I’ve read so many disgusting comments aimed at anyone who dares to think differently. 

I had SARS back in 2003 and was hospitalized for it. Pretty terrible Coronavirus and I developed pneumonia. Went back to work in 2 weeks. There was no special employment insurance to tide me over. No $1000 cheque. I suffered financially. And no one was losing their shit to the level I’m seeing now. No one! 

The 3 people I know who have the virus, including two old people, describe it as a bad cold. They’re recovering nicely.

Creo este post para sacar unas cuantas dudas e ideas que veo circulando constantemente en el sub. Voy a tratar de poner fuentes para todo. Espero que no me borren el post porque creo que es informacion muy importante! 

&#x200B;

**FACT:** los Chinos ya tienen una vacuna lista para usar. **FALSO**!

Los chinos lo que tienen lista es una vacuna para probar en fase clinica, igual que USA. Este proceso puede durar de 12 a 18 meses. Esto es normal e incluso esta acelerado, ya que se saltea la fase de prueba en animales debido a la seriedad de la situacion.

Fuentes:  [China](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-china-vaccine/china-gives-go-ahead-for-human-trials-of-potential-covid-19-vaccine-state-media-idUSKBN2141TI),  [USA](https://www.nih.gov/news-events/news-releases/nih-clinical-trial-investigational-vaccine-covid-19-begins), [salteo de pruebas animales](https://www.livescience.com/coronavirus-vaccine-trial-no-animal-testing.html)

&#x200B;

**FACT:** El virus lo hicieron los chinos, mezclado con HIV. **ALTAMENTE IMPROBABLE**!

El virus (SARS-CoV-2) es un virus con alta homologia genetica a anteriores coronavirus, los cuales todos provienen de animales, especificamente en este caso de murcielagos. Los murcielagos tienen un sistema immune muy particular que los hace reservorios de grandes cantidades de virus con potencial zoonotico (de infectar humanos). Todos los primeros infectados provienen del mismo mercado de alimentos en Wuhan. De todas maneras, la teoria sobre si es un virus creado en laboratorio no se puede terminar de descartar hasta que no se aisle y secuencie el virus en el reservorio. 

Fuentes: [Este paper](http://virological.org/t/the-proximal-origin-of-sars-cov-2/398), [este otro](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17848070) (sobre como los virus SARS tienden a pasar de animales a humanos), [este paper](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2176051/), avisando de este problema en 2007: "" Coronaviruses are well known to undergo genetic recombination ([375](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2176051/#r375)), which may lead to new genotypes and outbreaks. The presence of a large reservoir of SARS-CoV-like viruses in horseshoe bats, together with the culture of eating exotic mammals in southern China, is a time bomb. ""

**FACT:** Si sos del grupo de riesgo, te vas a morir. **FALSO!**

Asi no funcionan las probabilidades. Lo que se conoce hasta ahora es la Tasa de Muerte de Infeccion (Case Fatality Rate o CFR). Esta es la cantidad de infectados que murieron por el virus*.* No es la tasa de muerte general para la poblacion porque simplemente no se conocen el total de los casos debido a que un gran numero son casos asintomaticos/con sintomas leves. Este numero va variando a medida que se dan los casos. Lo que indica la CFR es la probabilidad (o riesgo) de morirte si tenes el virus. Eso no implica que te vayas a morir o que vayas a vivir, es simplemente las chances de que pase algo. Dicho esto, podes morirte siendo joven y vivir siendo viejo.  Hay casos de ambos lados (obviamente menos del lado de los jovenes y por eso la probabilidad es baja), pero escuchar que un pibe de 20 se muere no hace menos o mas probable que se muera un joven (a menos que se empiecen a morir a mansalva, en ese caso se ajustan las probabilidades).

Fuentes:[Enciclopedia Britanica](https://www.britannica.com/science/case-fatality-rate), [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case_fatality_rate)

**FACT:** El alcohol puro es mejor que el diluido. **FALSO!**

El alcohol puro no denaturaliza las proteinas (no las ""desarma"" por decirlo de alguna manera) y no penetra la celula, por lo que no termina de matarla. El alcohol diluido al 70% con agua logra pasar la membrana externa de la celula/virus y actuar adecuadamente.

Fuente: [esta explicacion](https://labproinc.com/blog/chemicals-and-solvents-9/post/the-difference-between-isopropyl-alcohol-ipa-99-and-70-25)

**FACT:** el virus es como cualquier otra gripe. **FALSO!**

La gripe tiene una tasa de mortalidad del 0.1%. El SARS-CoV-2 tiene, por lo pronto, una CFR de 3.6% promedio. Este numero puede bajar significativamente una vez que se conozca la cantidad de infectados totales, como explique antes, pero estiman que no baja del 0.8%, como se observa actualmente en Korea del Sur, donde estan haciendo una cantidad enorme de tests. 

Por otro lado, la gripe tiene una tasa de transmision (R0) de 1.3, lo cual indica que una persona infectada transmite, en promedio, la enfermedad a otras 1.3 personas. El virus actual tiene un R0 de entre 2 y 3. 

Fuente: [este articulo](https://www.sciencealert.com/the-new-coronavirus-isn-t-like-the-flu-but-they-have-one-big-thing-in-common) lo resume muy bien.

&#x200B;

Si se les ocurre algo mas que quieran preguntar, estoy a su disposicion. Escribiria muchisimo mas pero me parece que esto es lo mas importante y lo que todos quieren saber. Ya esta mas que probado que las medidas de distanciamiento social son lo que nos va a salvar de que el sistema de salud no colapse, asi que quedense en sus casas si pueden, no solo por su bien si no por el de todos los que tienen mayor riesgo de morir.

The Overton window is the range of policies politically acceptable to the mainstream population at a given time.  It is also known as the window of discourse. The term is named after Joseph P. Overton, who stated that an idea's political viability depends mainly on whether it falls within this range, rather than on politicians' individual preferences. According to Overton, the window frames the range of policies that a politician can recommend without appearing too extreme to gain or keep public office given the climate of public opinion at that time.

> Shortages of products may occur, impacting health care, emergency services, and other elements of critical infrastructure,” the plan warns, according to the Times. “This includes potentially critical shortages of diagnostics, medical supplies (including PPE [personal protective equipment] and pharmaceuticals), and staffing in some locations.”

> The plan was finalized Friday, the same day President Trump declared the virus a national emergency, and outlines several possible options for federal responses, including invoking the Defense Production Act (DPA) of 1950, which originated during the Korean War and allows executive action to ramp up production of supplies such as ventilators.

> “State and local governments, as well as critical infrastructure and communications channels, will be stressed and potentially less reliable,” the plan reads, according to the Times. “These stresses may also increase the challenges of getting updated messages and coordinating guidance to these jurisdictions directly.”

> The plan’s reference to the DPA comes as numerous congressional Democrats have urged President Trump to invoke the law’s powers.

> “During World War II, our country adapted to the demands of the time to produce mass quantities of bombers, tanks, and many smaller items needed to save democracy and freedom in the world,” Rep. Andy Levin (D-Mich.) and 57 other House Democrats said in a letter last week. “We know what the demands of this time are, and we must act now to meet these demands.”

> As recently as Tuesday, Trump said the situation did not yet call for an invocation of the law, telling reporters, “We’re able to do that if we have to. Right now, we haven’t had to, but it’s certainly ready. If I want it, we can do it very quickly. We’ve studied it very closely over two weeks ago, actually. We’ll make that decision pretty quickly if we need it.”

> The plan adds that the virus’s spread and severity “will be difficult to forecast and characterize” and could result in “significant shortages for government, private sector, and individual U.S. consumers.”

> The Hill has reached out to the White House and Vice President Pence's office for comment."

So far no two countries have followed the exact same path. In China they did a slightly different strategy than South Korea. Even Hong Kong did something different. 

[https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/17/world/asia/coronavirus-singapore-hong-kong-taiwan.html?action=click&module=Spotlight&pgtype=Homepage](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/17/world/asia/coronavirus-singapore-hong-kong-taiwan.html?action=click&module=Spotlight&pgtype=Homepage)

Singapore also did a slightly different model. I don't think there is anything wrong with it. As the model the Netherlands wishes to adopt seems to be based on multiple successful cases in Asia. 

How much does the government need to ""Shut things down"". That is a question. 

Optimally you want to get testing and healthy habits while leaving things open. For example close inside dining, but get healthy people to prepare food and have a drop off. That was used in Asia.

Everyone wearing masks outside, even when healthy. It protects you and others even if you believe you're not sick. Don't get too close to people. Don't touch your face. Wash your hands a lot.

There is a woman in China who not only was active in multiple groups of people, many had the virus. She didn't get it due to extreme precautions. 

The thing is the average person will have a lot less contact and if everyone behaved as defensive ""carriers"" IE believe they might be carrying and not engage in activities that spread it then things will be fine. Some people will get sick, maybe, it will be dramatically low. 

To give an example there is a spread in areas that get little international traffic. It came from people who traveled and didn't self quarantine. They have done thousands of tests and it is only among people who traveled and who had direct contact (not even all people as they went about and many still weren't affected).

If people who traveled at all past the state lines simply did a quarantine and got tested than the spread would have stopped quickly. 

IN conclusion there are other models. Most rely on either independent regulating or government regulating. The goal is to slow the spread. Now countries differ in the how."

To answer your question: yes and no. So people are panicking, but you are not worried enough. Basically it is much worse than the normal flu both in terms of deadliness and transmittablity. It also has a high rate of hospitalizations as severe cases need ventilators, and because of the high transmittablity can overwhelm the hospitals if a bunch of people get it at once.

So yeah, we should be very cautious of it. But at the same time, we are young and unlikely to be killed by it, so we do not need to be super afraid of catching it. But we should still isolate to slow the transmission and protect the people at high risk.

We'll learn a lot about how we can prepare for and tackle the next pandemic.

But every script kiddie who can `import keras` in a Kaggle kernel and tweet their poorly thought out graphs of arbitrary data splits is just noise that ultimately is really dangerous right now. We need to be able to hear a clear line to advice from experts and our Governments so we can stay informed.

A professor in my department (not even ML, a fucking theorist) was sending around really disturbing emails about applying for grant funding on the back of all the drama. ""Papers related to Coronavirus are being fast tracked in top tier journals!"" No, my dude. Those are case-studies of patient outcomes published by doctors very recently in medical journals because that's how the medical community shares information like this. 

Any penny of research funding we siphon away from those sorts of efforts for our own career progression is a penny that could have been actually used to effectively combat this right now. 

Our work as computer scientists comes later, when we pour over the data and help the medical community understand what happened. And we develop new methods in our domain to help understand that data in more detail. 

By all means if people are domain experts and are in a situation where they are prepared to directly apply their current work that is proven on this problem domain to COVID-19 data, go for it. See if you can find something helpful, you are after all an expert in specifically this. 

But if you are someone who knows some stats or is even an expert researcher but this specifically just isn't your actual sub-field. **Fucking sit this one out for now.** 

You can read up on the domain literature and research methodologies on your own time and prepare yourself to handle this problem ethically. We don't need you rushing in determined to save the fucking day. That's just insulting to the people who have dedicated their careers to studying this specific problem area. You're going to just jump in with a Kaggle kernel? Please. At this point we're just particle-swarm-optimizing combinations of pythons packages using script kiddies as the particles.

2020-03-18,TrilingualMammutidae,berlin,19,https://www.reddit.com/r/berlin/comments/fkwa55/merkel_hält_unglaubliche_rede_über_coronavirus/fkvedzi/,"Part one, translated by Deepl (and it's not brief):

My fellow citizens,

the coronavirus is currently changing life in our country dramatically. Our ideas of normality, of public life, of social interaction - all of these are being put to the test as never before. Millions of you can't go to work, your children can't go to school or go to daycare, theatres and cinemas and shops are closed, and, perhaps the hardest thing: we all miss the encounters that are otherwise taken for granted.

Of course, in such a situation, each of us is full of questions and worries about how to go on. I turn to you today on this unusual path because I want to tell you what guides me as Chancellor and all my colleagues in the Federal Government in this situation. This is part and parcel of an open democracy: that we also make political decisions transparent and explain them. That we justify and communicate our actions as well as possible so that they are comprehensible. I firmly believe that we will succeed in this task if really all citizens see it as YOUR task.

So let me say that this is serious. Take it seriously too. Since German reunification, no, since the Second World War, there has not been a challenge to our country that depends so much on our joint solidarity. I would like to explain to you where we currently stand in the epidemic, what the Federal Government and the levels of government are doing to protect everyone in our community and limit the economic, social and cultural damage. But I would also like to explain to you why you are needed for this and what each and every one of you can contribute.

As far as the epidemic is concerned - and everything I am telling you about it comes from the Federal Government's ongoing consultations with the experts of the Robert Koch Institute and other scientists and virologists: research is being carried out under high pressure worldwide, but there is still neither a therapy against the coronavirus nor a vaccine. As long as this is the case, there is only one thing we can do, and that is to slow down the spread of the virus, stretch it over the months and thus gain time. Time for research to develop a drug and a vaccine. But above all time so that those who fall ill can receive the best possible care.

Germany has an excellent healthcare system, perhaps one of the best in the world. That can give us confidence. But our hospitals would also be completely overwhelmed if too many patients who suffer a severe course of corona infection were admitted in the shortest possible time. These are not just abstract numbers in a statistic, but a father or grandfather, a mother or grandmother, a partner, they are people. And we are a community in which every life and every person counts.

I would like to take this opportunity to address first and foremost all those who work as doctors, in the nursing service or in any other function in our hospitals and in the health care system in general. They are at the forefront of this struggle. They are the first to see the sick and how severe some courses of infection are. And every day you go back to your work and are there for the people. What you do is tremendous, and I thank you for it with all my heart.

So: the aim is to slow down the virus on its way through Germany. And in doing so, we have to rely on one thing, which is existential: to shut down public life as far as possible. Of course, with reason and a sense of proportion, because the state will continue to function, the supply will of course continue to be secured and we want to preserve as much economic activity as possible. But everything that could endanger people, everything that could harm the individual, but also the community, we must reduce that now.

We must limit the risk of one infecting the other as much as we can. I know how dramatic the restrictions are already: no more events, no more fairs, no more concerts and, for the time being, no more school, no university, no kindergarten, no playing in a playground. I know how hard the closures, which have been agreed upon by the federal and state governments, interfere with our lives and also with our democratic self-image.

They are restrictions such as have never been seen before in the Federal Republic. Let me assure you: For someone like me, for whom freedom of travel and movement was a hard-won right, such restrictions can only be justified as an absolute necessity. In a democracy, they should never be decided lightly and only temporarily - but at the moment they are indispensable to save lives.

That is why the tightened border controls and entry restrictions to some of our most important neighbouring countries have been in force since the beginning of the week. It is already very difficult for the economy, for large companies as well as small businesses, for shops, restaurants, freelancers. The coming weeks will be even harder.

* A Japanese flu drug called favipiravir has been deemed ‘clearly  effective’ in treating coronavirus. Patients who were positive for  Covid-19 were given the medicine in China and tested negative for the  disease after a median of four days. For those treated with the drug,  lung conditions improved in 91 per cent of patients, compared to 62 per  cent of those without the drug.
* The British Red Cross has seen 10,000 people sign up to volunteer to  help others in the last week. The community reserves are currently  providing doorstep support – dropping off milk, delivering food parcels,  delivering the daily paper – and this is set to expand in the coming  days.
* Venice canals, usually bogged down with tourists in gondolas and  motorboats are now crystal clear. Those who venture out into the city  and peer down into the water may even see little silver fish swimming  around.  
* Scientists from the University of Oxford have developed a new  coronavirus test that provides results in just 30 minutes – three times  quicker than the current fastest testing methods. The equipment is  relatively simple and researchers say it could help detect coronavirus  in the earlier stages of infection too.
* Chelsea Football Club is making their Millennium Hotel at Stamford  Bridge available to NHS staff, to support those working long shifts who  may not be able to travel home. The club’s owner Roman Abramovich is  covering the costs of providing the accommodation.
* The locked-down French followed in the Spaniards' footsteps last  night, taking to their windows and balconies to cheer for the health  workers at 8pm. The collective act of solidarity was first seen in Spain  earlier in the week, when citizens opened their windows to clap for  those working with coronavirus patients."

RBC, a Russian business newspaper, found that Rosstat, the country’s official statistics agency, has recorded an increase of 37 percent of cases of “community-acquired pneumonia” in January as compared to January 2019, which could fit similar symptoms to the coronavirus. Such an increase would represent nearly 2,000 cases.

>Other evidence that a much larger spread of the virus could be hiding in Russia was put forward by the Doctor’s Alliance , a recently formed countrywide union for medical professionals, who said that the true figure of those infected with the new coronavirus could be in the thousands, but that many cases have likely been labelled as pneumonia. 

>In a recent video posted on the group’s YouTube channel, the organization also warned about a lack of protective gear in hospitals outside of major cities in Russia’s regions that could lead to more infections.

we urgently need an app that saves your location info locally on your phone (if you are concerned for your privacy) or online (china already has this, korea as well from what i heard) and only IF you get infected can share the data. to prevent misuse only doctors and health authorities should be able to unlock the infection status.

the location could be saved locally, but it should be possible for everyone to trace back the route of infected people on a map and get warnings, if they have been close to someone infected.

this would make it much easier to know if you have been at risk and can self contain or at least be much more careful not to infect anyone else.

the big tech companies should have had something like this ready for months. what are they waiting for. facebook and other social media platforms should also have an option to input this info there, so people can see that friends got infected. of course you need to verify infections by health authorites there as well, so that people do not randomly put their status as infected."

We want everyone to get familiar with and engaged in a  [remote learning environment](http://we.discover.uw.edu/ol/hkpSecLMdlhd6BIkvN2xEPu7yniTKM3-9vEwXaGzgoIuy0d6P6GCaxW50ZVcD5U7YbTORwYZF80xhh9WR7DTeYlEp_RfCkW1XSnflbaUaolbN6F62Jw1p_rj22gAqdaxh1GRWxdbEiM8PUCYcasyhWChdtY,/jEBUcsbPIllNoVdlsbPWNb760SLBaZChtbtpBvmo18srllx7c-_HMU_ox8deDJsxdqaKBAMTG5lvx0FZFOTYcIVB6PtUBUb_TzP6juzZY4xdYrFgkcJg8bzo1WUAvpLdn1fYNlsBSyxpfSyNQLUvjQrRNLsiVFa_yE_jNIYvqn08sq0W-4uCbpq6ynqP_G787z-nYWZx9M-u0nmuD65QstMkiU4R5EBzR7L59AHgxo4knxwN8b5dpR5L8vBwFt5-5BmOCiXU0oPMRexWQ7u2tMz8tNIQPBImpokXYUDfG2OyBIaTQy5X_iCpwywAEmJBEzpwWt0Ggjy37XdQdrgkSQ6QtiQX3k0L-Pp3iLzetX6kZEn9PQXMuyOOnhqae5E1w36nzuYYxHv6CSr5ystJRkTzNNXepnyzasHJq0A9ZKU,)  and we will use the first week of the quarter for that purpose.  University and faculty leadership have been developing plans to provide  support for all faculty and staff as we transition coursework and serve  students in new and innovative ways through this transition.    
 

We recognize that moving to remote instruction is a hardship and a  challenge during an already difficult time and we are grateful to all of  you for making this transition possible. Your dedication to students is  so greatly appreciated. We also realize that some courses simply cannot  be offered online. Deans, chairs and other leaders are working to  provide flexible options for students by adjusting schedules to ensure  academic progress and paths to graduation continue successfully.  Faculty, instructional staff and graduate students can expect guidance  from the Office of the Provost in a separate communication today, as  well as additional information from unit leadership in the coming days.    
 

**Policies and procedures to maximize employee safety**   
 

Throughout spring quarter, our three campuses will continue with  modified operations in order to provide critical academic, research and  clinical work. UW Medicine and other clinical operations on campus will  also be developing appropriate policies and protocols to maintain  essential clinical services.  **Currently, for non-clinical employees, guidance includes:**   
  

* **All employees who can perform their work remotely without hampering critical operations should telework as much as feasible.**  Supervisors should also work with their employees to maintain  employment and pay to the greatest extent possible. Helpful guidance can  be found on the [HR website](http://we.discover.uw.edu/ol/hkpSdsfHdlhd6BIkvN2xEPu7yniTKM3-9vEwXaGzgoIuy0d6P6GCaxW50ZVcD5U7YbTORwYZF80xhh9WR7DTeYlEp_RfCkW1XSnflbaUaolbN6F62Jw1p_rj22gAqdaxh1GRWx1WFiE_MECYcasyhWChdtY,/jEpZdsTML1lNoVdlsbPWKrujiiKOf5y99L9yG_jo09k3y11tPbPCM1XQnNxaQZcrT_m3Cw0ZJKZl6w1TT9inSKJB-_lrXnWFSCnSmYjJRoN_eJt69vti9YHw72wVpOi6t07PPnUnRFRaazOReeoa1jLwBLcnbQKxwE3FZ60LngwMib8ywYSvd7Tg-kSW-XDM6A2POlVZys-TxWXvAIhHl-4bkU8W0FEtcevM7xPI8ZlwsB4YrMNChzY8xNRiDPs47BmIDQ7syqvWQtx0YJ-fwsykidstPis7upIsXlzLGn7mGrDKaRVw-ybZrw0ZYBZWDydvLcU5k0K_nnpQRegiFySkmSAJnQ,,). If you have questions about how to assist employees in need, please reach out to your HR consultant.
* **Faculty and staff who are performing in-person work should,  to the maximum extent possible, implement appropriate social distancing  protocols.**
* Facilities such as dining services in residence halls and many  offices will have limited operations that minimize in-person interaction  and/or will be operated remotely. For security, most UW buildings will  move to card key access only by Friday morning, similar to weekends or  holidays, so that employees who need access to buildings can do so in as  safe a manner as possible.

We also recognize that with K-12 schools closed, many employees  are facing childcare needs. The University is activating additional  childcare resources, which will be prioritized for employees whose  services are most essential in dealing with this pandemic, such as first  responders, health care professionals and custodial staff.

However, some asymptomatic cases may develop mild symptoms, but they are still very unlikely to die from the virus. They are also likely to be infectious for up to 3 weeks ([Hu at al.,  2020](https://doi.org/10.1007/s11427-020-1661-4)), though  it's likely they are less infectious than those who have symptoms (are coughing).

It appears that COVID-19 kills via an immune mediate response, an overly aggressive reaction to the virus causes ARDS ([Acute Repertory Distress Syndrome](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/ards/symptoms-causes/syc-20355576)).

This overly aggressive immune response causes the [alveoli of the lungs](https://www.verywellhealth.com/what-are-alveoli-2249043) to fill with fluid, resulting viral pneumonia, gas exchange slows or ceases (suffocation). It is thought that this aggressive immune response is related to how many previous coronavirus infections a person had, [common colds](https://i1.wp.com/www.compoundchem.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/The-viruses-behind-colds-and-flu.png?ssl=1) or even unknown [zoonotic](https://www.cdc.gov/onehealth/basics/zoonotic-diseases.html) coronaviruses that went unnoticed over the years because they caused only mild symptoms or none at all (about 5%-10% of common colds are caused by relatively harmless coronaviruses distantly related to SARS-COV-2).

It's proposed that Elderly people had more coronavirus infections over their lifetime and that maybe why their immune response to SARS-COV-2 is particularly aggressive *i.e.* [antibody dependent enhancement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibody-dependent_enhancement) (see: [Tetro, 2020](https://www-sciencedirect-com.jproxy.nuim.ie/science/article/pii/S1286457920300344)). Older people are less likely to be asymptomatic, and more likely to have severe symptoms and die. This  antibody dependent enhancement (ADE) theory may also explain the geographic variation in CFR, *the CFR is higher where people had more coronavirus infections.*

The case fatality ratio in 70 year olds in China, Italy and on the Diamond Princess is about 8% and 1.1% overall (this is likely not an overestimate, everyone on the Diamond Princess was tested just like in Vò). However,  Japanese researchers estimated that 17% on the ship were asymptomatic, this lower than Italy but it might be because >80% on the ship were over 60 years old. *Older people are less likely to be asymptomatic.*

This aggressive immune response also makes designing vaccines challenging, a SARS-COV-1 vaccine tested on animals (the virus responsible for the 2002-03 SARS epidemic) made their illness worse, most vaccinated animals died.

This is very different from Flu which usually affects infants and the very old (the Spanish flu additionally affected young adults). COVID-19's age distribution is more like [Legionnaires disease](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Andrea_Farnham/publication/269774329/figure/fig1/AS:295120617394180@1447373646796/Legionnaires-disease-incidence-no-cases-100-000-population-by-sex-and-age-group-New.png).

As we reported earlier today, six counties in the Bay Area have issued a “shelter-in-place” order with the hope to reduce the transmission of COVID-19 and flatten the growth of the virus.

They stated:

>*Everyone is to work from home, or stop working, unless they provide an essential service: health care workers; police, fire, and other emergency responders.*

We received[ reports from Tesla employees at Fremont factory](https://electrek.co/2020/03/16/tesla-fremont-factory-shut-down-shelter-in-place/) saying that the company is telling them that they will be expected to work tomorrow unless they feel ill.

It wasn’t clear if Tesla managed to obtain an exemption.

Now CEO Elon Musk addressed the issue directly in an email to all Tesla employees obtained by *Electrek*.

The CEO started by making it clear that employees are not forced to go to work:

>*First, I’d like to be super clear that if you feel the slightest bit ill or even uncomfortable, please don’t feel obligated to come to work. I will personally be at work, but that is just me. Totally OK if you want to stay home for any reason.*

Over the last few days, we have received report of rumors that some employees at Tesla Fremont factory have been infected by the virus.

Musk said that no one has tested positive to the best of Tesla’s knowledge:

>*A  lot of rumors are flying around, but, to the best of our knowledge, no one at Tesla (over 56,000 people) has tested positive for COVID-19. I will inform you immediately if anything changes.*

After that, the CEO was critical of the level of panic around the virus:

>*My frank opinion remains that the harm from the coronavirus panic far exceeds that of the virus itself. If there is a massive redirection of medical resources out of proportion to the danger, it will result in less available care to those with critical medical needs, which does not serve the greater good.*

Though he also issued a warning for family gatherings:

>*What the COVID-19 coverage does show is that the danger of colds and flu in general can be high for the elderly, especially if there is prior lung damage. Much is made of public gatherings, but please be cautious of family gatherings, too. What is relatively harmless to a child can be dangerous to grandparents.*

Musk added his own prediction:

>*My best guess, for what it is worth, based on the latest Center for Disease Control data, is that confirmed COVID-19 (this specific form of the common cold) cases will not exceed 0.1% of the US population. Moreover, I do not think, when we look back on 2020, that the causes of death or serious injury will have changed much from 2017, for example: (*[*CDC statistic*](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nvsr/nvsr68/nvsr68_09-508.pdf)*).*

The CEO then reiterated that employees should “not feel obligated to come to work if they have any concern.”

However, he didn’t elaborate on paid leaves or job security."

Think you have coronavirus? Great... Where the fuck would you get tested? Who even knows? We don't have enough test kits to go around, advice has been all over the place, constantly changing. The government is doing next to nothing to ensure widespread testing, and squandered months they could have taken to prepare. No one knows what the fuck to do, and no one is showing any leadership.


Sick at work? Ok... Most people have no idea whether they can get leave, many won't be paid. The best the government's done is promise some people $750 in 2-4 weeks time. What about paying rent and mortgages? What about incomes, especially for casual workers? No fucking reassurance here either.


Terrified by shops being cleared out? Aren't we all? ... Expert advice for disasters has always been to have enough for at least a couple of weeks. How are people supposed to know what/how much to buy? The recent bushfire disaster saw thousands scrambling to find food and basics and no one wants to be in that position. The government barely got their shit together to feed bushfire-hit towns, and instead of reassuring they're lecturing - but they have no credibility. If anything, they're making people even more frightened. If you have a family with kids, and you need to buy for 2 weeks, that's a fucking lot of shopping. Why isn't the government doing more to secure supply chains? Why isn't the government providing assistance to supermarkets obviously not coping? I mean if they can't cope now how the fuck will they cope when thousands are on home isolation? 


Worried about your kids at school? Worried they'll spread infection like multiple studies indicate they will? Hearing repeated advice from most medical experts, the WHO, multiple other countries that schools, businesses, restaurants etc should urgently close to flatten the curve? Too bad... Morrison wants to prioritise the economy and try out the ""herd immunity"" plan the UK tossed within two days after realising it would cost at least 250,000 extra lives.


People shouldn't be directing anger at each other here. We should be directing anger at our incompetent fucking government.

Israel, according to the article, is going to quarantine people based on mobile location data indicating proximity to someone with COVID-19. I would really not want to be forced to stay home simply because my phone was near someone else's phone who later ended up under investigation for coronavirus symptoms.

Let me disabuse you of that belief: they do not. They want as little disruption to the economy as possible which means letting the virus 'run' through the population. Will people die? Of course, but it will occur primarily at the peak and then wittle down with time. The coronavirus policy being adopted by the Australian government is that of natural selection; the loss of the weak, while those that survive hopefully carry on some immunity from the exposure. The economy will undeniably feel the blow for a couple of months as we all literally struggle to breathe through this pandemic, and then, as people recover, it will be back to business as usual. A couple of months of this is preferable to our business-minded, profit-above-everything  government rather than have 6mths+ of event cancellations, travel bans, and business closures.

2020-03-18,wolfsog23,Coronavirus,18,https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/fl0vhy/truckers_facing_coronavirus_hurdles_in_keeping/fkvyb0o/,"Text:
Truckers are trying to navigate growing challenges on highways and at loading docks as they seek to keep supply chains running to meet surging coronavirus-driven demand for consumer staples and medical equipment.

Truck-stop restaurants in some states have shut dining rooms and switched to takeout service to comply with health orders aimed at controlling the spread of the virus. On Tuesday, Pennsylvania closed its state-run rest stops, cutting back significant parking space along key logistics corridors.

Some customers are asking drivers to stay in their trucks or switch from paper to electronic methods to document pickups and deliveries, trucking companies and freight brokers said. Additionally, some trucking companies said their drivers are facing new restrictions at receiving docks if they have been in states considered coronavirus hot zones.

“Some of the shippers and receivers are asking drivers to sign affidavits that they are not sick,” said Linda Allen, owner of Hardcore Trucking, a trucking company based in Spring Hill, Fla., that hauls refrigerated loads.

The American Trucking Associations industry group has asked the Trump administration to exempt truckers delivering essential goods from travel and other restrictions aimed at containing the pandemic.

In a letter Tuesday, the group also asked for rest stops to be kept open and for guidance on driver health, including possible testing for Covid-19. “Absent policies like these, it will be more difficult to ensure that the shelves are stocked and emergency supplies reach first responders and medical personnel,” ATA Chief Executive Chris Spear said in the letter.

Trucking capacity is getting tighter as demand surges from retailers and manufacturers hustling to replenish stores and distribution centers cleaned out by shoppers stockpiling food and sanitizing supplies. On Tuesday, the average rate to hire a truck on the spot market, where businesses book last-minute transportation, had increased 6.1% since Feb. 29 to $1.89 per mile including fuel, according to online freight marketplace DAT Solutions LLC.

Shipments of items such as electronics and health and beauty products are being delayed as retailers make more room in distribution centers and stores for food, paper products and diapers, according to Mac Pinkerton, president of freight broker C.H. Robinson Worldwide Inc.’s North American Surface Transportation division.

“Given the amount of foodstuffs and consumables being purchased, it has created a tremendous amount of disruption across those supply chains,” said Mr. Pinkerton.

Some drivers aren’t willing to haul loads to states such as New York or Washington where the numbers of coronavirus cases are highest “because when they go to other states, they are stopped at the gate and asked where they have been,” said Libby O’Hara, U.S. operations director for Logistics Plus Inc., an Erie, Pa.-based logistics and trucking provider.

Pennsylvania is home to large clusters of warehouses and distribution centers, and serves as a major lane for freight moving through the East Coast and the Midwest. News that Pennsylvania was shutting down its state-run rest stops raised alarms among truckers.

The Owner-Operator Independent Drivers Association asked the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration, the main U.S. regulator of trucking operations, to direct states to ensure truck stops would remain open. “For professional drivers, rest areas aren’t simply places to purchase snacks and beverages from vending machines—they are invaluable locations to rest when fatigued,” the group said in a letter Tuesday.

On Wednesday, the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation said it would reopen 13 rest areas by Thursday for truck parking with portable toilets that would be cleaned once a day.

FMCSA recently lifted hourly driving restrictions for truckers hauling critical medical goods and food for emergency restocking of stores in response to the pandemic. On Wednesday, the agency expanded its national emergency declaration to include fuel, paper products and other groceries as well as raw materials such as paper, plastic and alcohol used to manufacture essential items.

Most major truck-stop chains and many independent truck stops remain open, although some have closed sit-down restaurants and are preparing food for pickup or takeout, said Lisa Mullings, chief executive of NATSO, a trade group for the travel plaza and truck stop industry.

On Tuesday, FMSCA acting administrator Jim Mullen said in a letter to NATSO that “in the coming weeks and months, it will be critical that these businesses remain open, 24 hours a day, providing America’s truck drivers with fuel, food, showers, repair services and opportunities to rest.”

Truck-stop chains Pilot Flying J and TravelCenters of America, which operates TA and Petro Stopping Centers, said in online updates that their showers are open and employees are stepping up cleaning and disinfecting restrooms and commonly used areas. Both chains have posted state-by-state updates on changes in dining service.

Pilot Flying J said in its update that “we strongly encourage drivers [to] use social distancing while in our stores.”"

They need to realize that if they keep jerking the public around like this, then no one will believe anything that they say anymore. I think public trust is already waning as time goes on. People are not as stupid, individually, as politicians think.

Look, I get it: If you don't wear PPE right, it doesn't work. We've seen people cutting holes in respirators for cigarettes and other things like that. But if we can teach pubescent boys to wear condoms, and for girls to wear diaphragms, then we can teach people to wear masks. In the end, people get pregnant, yes, and some will wear masks wrong. But that doesn't mean we just throw our hands up and say, ""Welp! Teens gonna screw! Have at it kids!"" We don't throw up our hands and say ""Oh well!"" when antivaxxers spread misinformation and refuse to have their kids protected.

We teach. We inform. That's the basis of a well-educated society. We can do that here. Just because a small portion of citizens are ignorant and resistant to change, doesn't mean everyone is."

I went to Goleta Valley Cottage yesterday because my GP was told by the county Public Health offices that it was the only way to get tested. Dr. Pryzowsky was the attending physician...it was a trash fire of a situation. They have no protocol. 

I called from outside as instructed in the sign and explained that I have had a cough for 10 days and am interested in being tested for COVID-19. The person on the phone said “I’m too busy, just come on in, it’s fine”. I asked if she was sure and she said “you know what I just can’t do this just come in”. 

The officer at the door didn’t let me in once she heard my cough. I was given a mask and was asked to wait outside. Understandable. 

They called me in for triage. The nurse was very nice, but did not wear any gloves or masks while taking my vitals. I expressed that I was there specifically at the instruction of my doctor to get tested for COVID-19. She said “oh yeah we’ll definitely test you, it’ll take 4 days to come back because there’s a lot of tests going out but we can definitely do it”. I asked her if they had many people come by for testing. She said “yes, tons!”  

I go in to see Dr Pryzowsky who tells me there are NO tests and that my doctor should not have sent me there. Super rude guy. I explain the county told my doctor that I should go to the ER to get tested. I was under the impression that GVCH was a testing site. He says no there’s no way we can test you unless you get a chest X-ray, blood labs and tested for other viral illness. He says it will take 7 days before I can be tested. 

I explain that I am not interested in taking up an ER room and his time since I am not in critical condition, so I would like to leave, seek testing elsewhere and continue care with my GP. I mentioned financial concerns as I recently lost my job due to the outbreak. Dr Pryzowsky then walks out the door while loudly exclaiming “we’ll get your x ray ready”. 

At this point I’m in a negative pressure room and I don’t want to cause a scene, so I call my GP to tell him I have to wait 7 days for a test, and then I knock on the door to ask if I can leave. A nurse in full gear comes into the room and says he’s here to “swab me” but I explain I am no longer interested. The nurse lets me walk out. 

Dr Pryzowsky stops me on my way out to ask “what’s the deal”. I tell him (again) that I am not in critical condition and would like to go home. He argues, saying “we were gonna test you for the coronavirus”. I get a coughing fit and this man freaks out, and says “you’re gonna have to get out of my ER if you’re gonna be coughing like that”. I step outside to the waiting room. 

I get a call from my GP who wants to know who was the attending physician. I had forgotten Dr Pryzowsky’s last name (it’s not easy to spell) so I ask the receptionist. They say they’re gonna send someone with the doctor’s info and I am instructed to sit down and wait, until the same nurse who was going to swab me comes out and asks me to step outside. I wait on the sidewalk. The nurse comes back again and tells me I need to leave immediately. I remind him that I was asked to wait for the name of the doctor who saw me. The officer at the door then tells me I am considered MIA and they cannot provide me with any information. 

Dr Pryzowsky then comes out for a little more arguing. He’s confrontational as fuck. I tell him I’m not interested. He is joined by the only sensible person in this situation, a hospital administration person named Mary who came out to give me Dr Pryzowsky’s information. She sat with me as I explained what happened and she apologized. She recognized that Dr Pryzowsky can be “quite short at times” and assured me I would not be billed for what had just happened. 

So, that’s my story. I saw his name on this today and almost had a heart attack. If this is the person in charge of our local response to COVID-19, I do not have much hope.

Edit: to add that Dr Pryzowsky did not wear gloves or a mask at any point during our interactions either, which I found completely negligent"

Walsh emphasized Wednesday that the city currently has no plans to issue such an order, but acknowledged it could still be a “realistic” option.Mayor Marty Walsh says there's no immediate plans for a shelter-in-place order yet.Walsh noted that he was aware that New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio told residents to prepare for the possibility of a shelter-in-place order in coming days. (Worth noting: New York Governor Andrew Cuomo has said the state would have to approve such an order, and he has no interest in doing so.)However, Walsh said, “the governor and myself and other elected officials in Massachusetts have not suggested that yet.”Asked what would prompt such an order, Walsh replied, “I don’t think it’s a question of how bad it gets, I think it’s a question of when is the right time, if it has to be done. I think there’s a lot that has to come into play there.”Still, Walsh acknowledged, “I’m not saying that would never be a potential option. I think it could be very realistic that it could be an option.”Walsh said he is watching other orders issued in places like the Bay Area and Italy, and noted that any local decision would be based on “watching the data and where the curve is and where we’re going.”“We could be standing here in four hours, having a very different conversation. Literally that seems to be what’s happening with this,” he said.Walsh also said he was planning to call de Blasio to find out more about what led the New York City mayor to his thinking, saying that the pair — as well as Seattle Mayor Jenny Durkan — were “learning from each other and sharing best practices” as the pandemic progresses.Walsh also said he had concerns about giving residents a multiple-day warning that such an order was coming, as de Blasio apparently did: “My concern in that particular case is as people are out and about getting food and stuff for their house, what kind of potential spread is happening there,” he said.In the Bay Area order, which includes the city of San Francisco, the order required residents to stay inside and venture out only for necessities for three weeks. The order there went into effect Tuesday.“The most important thing you can do is remain home as much as possible,” San Francisco Mayor London Breed posted on Twitter. “There is no need to rush out for food or supplies, as these stores will remain open.”A Q&A from the city of San Francisco notes that not complying with the order is a misdemeanor crime — “although the intent is not for anyone to get into trouble.”In Boston, Walsh said the response to the coronavirus outbreak is “a very fluid situation every day.”“Obviously, if situations change, we will update the public and let them know,” Walsh said. “As of right now, that is not a situation that I think we can talk about.”Martin Finucane of the Globe staff contributed to this report.

By Jay Peters on March 17, 2020

A medical device manufacturer has threatened to sue a group of volunteers in Italy that 3D printed a valve used for life-saving coronavirus treatments. The valve typically costs about $11,000 from the medical device manufacturer, but the volunteers were able to print replicas for about $1

A hospital in Italy was in need of the valves after running out while treating patients for COVID-19. The hospital’s usual supplier said they could not make the valves in time to treat the patients, according to Metro. That launched a search for a way to 3D print a replica part, and Cristian Fracassi and Alessandro Ramaioli, who work at Italian startup Isinnova, offered their company’s printer for the job, reports Business Insider.

However, when the pair asked the manufacturer of the valves for blueprints they could use to print replicas, the company declined and threatened to sue for patent infringement, according to Business Insider Italia. Fracassi and Ramaioli moved ahead anyway by measuring the valves and 3D printing three different versions of them.

So far, the valves they made have worked on 10 patients as of March 14th, according to Massimo Temporelli, the founder of Italian manufacturing solutions company FabLab who helped recruit Fracassi and Ramaioli to print the replica valves.

“[The patients] were people in danger of life, and we acted. Period,” said Fracassi in a Facebook post. He also said that “we have no intention of profit on this situation, we are not going to use the designs or product beyond the strict need for us forced to act, we are not going to spread the drawing.”"

The problem with stuff like this being passed is that when you scare people enough, they'll agree to anything, and when the scare is over, the regulations stay.This is scaring a lot of people in Israel, but most are so terrified of Coronavirus right now they'll agree to practically anything.And that's not the worst part - Right now the previous ruling party (Likud) is using the 'max 10 people in a room' rule to prevent the Knesset's gatherings and government committees, virtually preventing the other parties from voting them out of office.

>Based on fits to the early growth-rate of the epidemic in Wuhan, we make a baseline **assumption** that R0=2.4 but examine values between 2.0 and 2.6.

>We **assume** that symptomatic individuals are 50% more infectious than asymptomatic individuals.

>Individual infectiousness is **assumed** to be variable...

>Infection was **assumed** to be seeded in each country at an exponentially growing rate

>Analyses of data from China as well as data from those returning on repatriation flights **suggest** that 40-50% of infections were not identified as cases.

>We therefore **assume** that two-thirds of cases are sufficiently symptomatic to self-isolate...

>The age-stratified proportion of infections that require hospitalisation and the infection fatality ratio (IFR) were obtained from an analysis of a subset of cases from China.

>We **assume** that 30% of those that are hospitalised will require critical care (invasive mechanical ventilation or ECMO) based on early reports from COVID-19 cases in the UK, China and Italy (Professor Nicholas Hart, personal communication).

>[W]e **assume** that 50% of those in critical care will die and an age-dependent proportion of those that do not require critical care die (calculated to match the overall IFR).

First, look how many assumptions were made. These were educated guesses based on early data. Most of them turned out to be wrong, in both directions. There are far more asymptomatic cases than previously believed (see, e.g., [here](https://news.sky.com/story/coronavirus-experiment-in-northern-italian-town-halts-all-new-infections-after-trial-11959587), finding roughly 10 of every 11 cases are asymptomatic). That alone makes this model completely, horrifically wrong. The initial rates in Wuhan and Northern Italy have also not held true elsewhere, and the assumed exponential growth has tailed off in pretty much every country that is far enough along in the process (many are now moving linearly, which is far less dangerous).

So basically, every or almost every assumption they made was wrong in the direction that would point to more deaths."
2020-03-18,ZappaBeefheart,Coronavirus,17,https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/fkwlnb/second_wave_of_coronavirus_cases_hits_asia/fkv7mqi/,"The linked article:

The number of coronavirus cases has spiked across Asia, crushing hopes that the region had contained the outbreak.

Officials in South Korea, Taiwan and parts of China and south-east Asia are rushing through new measures after a second wave of new infections following weeks of declines.

Experts say the sudden increase in cases has revealed the limits of both China’s sweeping lockdown of citizens and of the massive public testing and social distancing campaigns rolled out across Asia.

But it also highlights growing anxieties about new cases coming from abroad. The number of so-called imported infections has risen sharply as people flee the escalating coronavirus outbreak in Europe.

“What many people hadn’t recognised is that it is only a temporary success, it is not a permanent success,” said Ben Cowling, a professor of epidemiology at the University of Hong Kong.

“There is a challenge to containment by the increasing number of imported infections in all of these locations at the moment from Europe, but in the future it could be from other parts of the world as well,” he added.

China has been slowly unwinding restrictions after the countrywide lockdown that began in December. However, the number of imported coronavirus cases has jumped to 155 from fewer than 50 two weeks ago, according to Chinese government statistics.

The National Immigration Administration said on Monday that about 120,000 people a day had entered China from abroad since the World Health Organization labelled the virus a pandemic on March 11.

More than a dozen provinces, from Beijing to the border province of Yunnan, said international visitors, regardless of their condition and travel history, would be placed in quarantine for 14 days. Travelers will have to pay for food and accommodation during their quarantine.

In South Korea, which has suffered Asia’s worst outbreak outside China, the emergence of new clusters and the risk of imported cases has rattled officials.

Authorities in Daegu — South Korea’s fourth-largest city where mass testing and isolation had led to a big reduction in new cases — are now increasing inspections at high-risk facilities after the emergence of new clusters at nursing homes and churches.

“We believe the next two to three weeks will be very crucial,” said Yoon Tae-ho, a senior government health official.

Taiwan is closing its borders to practically all foreigners and intensifying quarantine measures on its own citizens. The moves come after officials accelerated efforts this week to identify and test Taiwanese citizens who had travelled abroad and seen a doctor for flu-like symptoms on their return.

Taiwan’s growth rate of new cases had been one of the lowest in the region, with just 100 confirmed cases on Tuesday. But over the past two weeks, that number has started to climb with officials reporting at least 31 imported infections. On Wednesday, Taiwan reported 23 new cases, of which 21 were imported.

In Hong Kong, the number of cases climbed to 168 on March 17 from 116 on March 9, and almost 90 per cent of those new patients had travelled recently. Health officials reported 14 new cases on Wednesday, the highest registered in a single day and all but one came from overseas.

Overseas students have rushed home as the virus spread across Europe. The government has told symptomatic people not to travel and anyone travelling from abroad will be subject to 14 days self-isolation from Thursday.

The number of new infections in Singapore, which has been lauded for its quick action to control the number of cases, has jumped almost 90 per cent to 313 in the past week.

“We expect more imported cases and, therefore, new clusters and new waves of infection, this time coming from many countries rather than one or two,” Lee Hsien Loong, Singapore’s prime minister, warned last week.

Developed by Fujifilm Toyama Chemical, and also referred to as Avigan, Favipiravir gained approval in Japan in 2014.

In 2016, Japan provided Favipiravir as emergency aid for the Ebola virus outbreak in Guinea, noted Reuters.

The drug received Chinese approval for manufacturing by Zhejiang Hisun Pharmaceutical to treat adults with new or recurring influenza, according to a filing by the company last month.

Last month, Chinese media reported that the drug received approval as an investigational therapy for Covid-19 coronavirus infection.

Here’s my theory about the actual coronavirus numbers and when it’ll peak in the US. It’s long so bear with me.

I’m going to use New York as a benchmark because they’re actually testing people. Still not enough, but they’re ahead of other states. They have about 2500 confirmed cases right now. The population of their state is 19.45 million. Simple math puts that as about one case per 8000 people. But that still doesn’t account for the people who aren’t showing any symptoms (whether or not they do in the future) or people who are feeling symptoms that are very mild but not getting tested. This is a very large number based on some articles I’ve read online. I’ll say that’s 10 times the amount of confirmed cases. So NY in reality most likely has close to 25,000 already. That’s one case per 800 people.

Now let’s apply that number to the entire country. The population of the US is 328 million people. Divide 328 million by 800 and you get 410,000. That’s about how many people I think have the virus in the US right now, even though the official count is still under 10,000.

The numbers are going to get crazy in the next few weeks. As states ramp up their testing capabilities, and the virus continues to spread, the curve will be doing the opposite of flattening. Right now we’re increasing at about 33% per day. Taking my number of 410,000, and applying that trend, in 2 weeks we’ll be at 20 million total cases, whether they’re confirmed or not. That’s the power of exponential growth. The official numbers will likely only be in the hundreds of thousands, though. Which is still really bad for our healthcare system. Even disastrous in some major metro areas.

I think in 2-3 weeks, though, we’ll see the curve start to flatten a little bit. Social distancing will take a little while to take effect on the spread of the virus, and we’ll likely see additional measures taken this week and next. This thing will peak in mid-to-late April and in May it will be declining. Additional cases will continue into the summer but by then, we’ll have it under control, and hopefully we’ll even have a treatment for it.

So buckle up...these next few weeks are about to get wild."

>The report, dated March 18, said that Russia-backed misinformation has sparked rioting in Ukraine and has driven people to buy potentially dangerous bogus remedies. It said Russia was pushing a false narrative that the virus was being brought to Europe by migrants.

>“The overarching aim of Kremlin disinformation is to aggravate the public health crisis in Western countries, specifically by undermining public trust in national health care systems — thus preventing an effective response to the outbreak,” the document said.

>The Kremlin denied the allegations on Wednesday. The Kremlin spokesman Dmitry S. Peskov told reporters that they were “groundless accusations,” according to Tass, the Russian state news agency.

>The E.U. report presents findings from strategic communications experts and researchers who have scoured the internet, social media and traditional news platforms for evidence of this type of coordinated action and for evidence that Russia is behind it.

>Western intelligence officials have said for years that President Vladimir Putin of Russia uses propaganda and disinformation as a way to sow suspicion and undermine confidence in democratic institutions. Russia’s campaign has targeted American and European elections and alliances like NATO and the European Union.

Since the virus started with a presumable single patient in Wuhan, wouldn't it just pick right back up again if even a tiny number of folks still have it?

In other countries, it seems the expectation is even hunkered down we can only ""flatten the curve"". Meaning the same number of cases, just spread out over a longer time with less strain on the hospitals. 

For example, Allegheny County, Pennsylvania is predicting 40-60% of their residents will get the virus, even with all non-essential businesses shut down. Thats 480,000 to 720,000 people 6 to 9 times the total number of infections (80,000) in china which has 1.5 billion people.

President Trump told governors in a conference call on Monday morning, “Respirators, ventilators, all of the equipment — try getting it yourselves. We will be backing you, but try getting it yourselves. Point of sales, much better, much more direct if you can get it yourself.”

Tom Inglesby, director of the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security, has proposed that the United States “needs a wartime mobilization” to boost the supply of ventilators. We’d settle for even a decent peacetime mobilization. On Wednesday, Mr. Trump took a welcome step in that direction, invoking the Defense Production Act, which allows him to order companies to shift production toward essential items in a crisis.

And perhaps the most glaring of all came from Trish Regan over on Fox Business, who accused the “liberal media” of using the coronavirus “to impeach the president. Her monologue may have cost her the job, though she chalked it up to Fox’s “prioritizing its coverage during market hours.”

Young people are not safe from this, at all, they just think that they are. They will die, their bodies will be permanently damaged.

————————

Feeling confused as to why Coronavirus is a bigger deal than Seasonal flu?  Here it is in a nutshell.  I hope this helps.  Feel free to share this to others who don’t understand.

It has to do with RNA sequencing, i.e. genetics.

Seasonal flu is an “all human virus”.  The DNA/RNA chains that make up the virus are recognized by the human immune system.  This means that your body has some immunity to it before it comes around each year...  you get immunity two ways...through exposure to a virus, or by getting a flu shot. 

Novel viruses, come from ANIMALS....the WHO (World Health Organization) tracks novel viruses in animals, (sometimes for years watching for mutations). Usually these viruses only transfer from animal to animal (pigs in the case of H1N1) (birds in the case of the Spanish flu).  But once one of these animal viruses mutates, and starts to transfer from animals to humans... then it’s a problem. Why? Because we have no natural or acquired immunity. The RNA sequencing of the genes inside the virus isn’t human, and the human immune system doesn’t recognize it so, we can’t fight it off.

Now sometimes, the mutation only allows transfer from animal to human. For years it’s only transmission is from an infected animal to a human, before it finally mutates so that it can now transfer human to human. Once that happens, we have a new contagion phase.  And depending on the fashion of this new mutation, that’s what decides how contagious, or how deadly it’s gonna be.

H1N1 was deadly, but it did not mutate in a way that was as deadly as the Spanish flu.    It’s RNA was slower to mutate and it attacked its host differently too. 

Fast forward.

Now, here comes this Coronavirus... it existed in animals only, for nobody knows how long...but one day, at an animal market, in Wuhan China in December 2019, it mutated and made the jump from ANIMAL TO PEOPLE.  At first, only animals could give it to a person... But here is the scary part.... in just TWO WEEKS it mutated AGAIN and gained the ability to jump from human to human.   Scientists call this quick ability, “slippery”

This Coronavirus, not being in any form a “human” virus (whereas we would all have some natural or acquired immunity), took off like a rocket!! And this was because humans have no known immunity...doctors have no known medicines for it.

And it just so happens that this particular mutated animal virus, changed itself in such a way that it causes great damage to human lungs.

That’s why Coronavirus is different from seasonal flu, or H1N1 or any other type of influenza....  this one is slippery AF.   And it’s a lung eater...And, it’s already mutated AGAIN, so that we now have two strains to deal with, strain s, and strain L....which makes it twice as hard to develop a vaccine.

We really have no tools in our shed, with this.  History has shown that fast and immediate closings of public places has helped in the past pandemics. Philadelphia and Baltimore were reluctant to close events in 1918 and they were the hardest hit in the US during the Spanish Flu.

Factoid:  Henry VIII stayed in his room and allowed no one near him, till the Black Plague passed...(honestly...I understand him so much better now). Just like us, he had no tools in his shed, except social isolation...

And let me end by saying....right now it’s hitting older folks harder... but this genome is so slippery...if it mutates again (and it will). Who is to say, what it will do next. 

Be smart, folks...  acting like you’re unafraid is so not sexy right now, and frankly stupid and selfish.

Stay home folks...  and share this to those that just are not catching on."

I cant even begin to imagine how an anarchist world or even China would handle a lethal pandemic with these levels of coordination, enforcement, swiftness and fast decision making and actiona as well as enforced measures in huge scales that needed to be undertaken in the span of weeks. 

Like how can such measures as what china did arise from horizontal direct democratic non hierarchical decision making and ""creative struggle"" among people in the communities or cities. The vast majority of people will never vote for, agree with and enact these measures after only some thousand cases. So with every city or community deciding differently through anarchist structures what bigger structure would enforce them and coerce them. What superstructure should coordinate and coerce communities and cities to follow strict measures. And even if you forgo anarchism and decide to enforse measures and guarantees and lockdowns in whole regions , what guarantees that a majority of the the communities quickly decide on the correct measures so that they would be able to force them. Wouldnt that be ""tyrany of the minority and extreme hierarchy and huge authoritarian decisions ?"" 

What if this was an even worse virus with a 15% fatality rate.Does everybody die??

I simply dont see that working at all in cases like that. Even with the ""federations"" and ""cooperation between communities and cities and regions"".

It should have really been clear just from a basic class analysis of the Democratic Party, but now it’s no longer abstract, it’s concrete, and there is very obviously no correct strategy that involves pulling the Democrats, one of the world’s oldest capitalist parties, to the side of the working class.

Banks Not Coming Close To Testing Upside Of Fed’s New Mega Repos
Initial demand far less than the amounts available totaling $1.5 trillion

The first three of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York’s mega repo operations have drawn far lighter demand than what the central bank is willing to provide.

On Thursday, the central bank shocked observers by announcing it would offer, in addition to its existing slate of loans to major banks, three repurchase agreements, or repos, that would provide eligible banks up to $500 billion per operation over an extended time horizon. The Fed said then it acted to “address highly unusual disruptions in Treasury financing markets associated with the coronavirus outbreak.”

While the overall pool of Fed liquidity has surged, eligible banks, called primary dealers, have thus far have not come close to tapping all the money the central bank can provide via the new slate of interventions.

On Thursday, the Fed’s first mega repo, which was one of four repo interventions that day, saw demand of $78.4 billion versus the half trillion dollar limit. On Friday, two of the repos, which collectively would have offered banks $1 trillion, saw bank demand of $17 billion in one operation, and $24.1 billion in the other. Meanwhile, the amount of money sought by dealers for the weekend was also well short of the Fed’s $175 billion cap, at $45.15 billion.

Collectively, the amount of temporary liquidity provided to financial markets by way of its repo interventions fell from $361.5 billion on Thursday to $344.65 billion on Friday.

The repo market shook the financial world in September when an unexpected rate spike choked short-term lending, spurring the Federal Reserve to intervene. WSJ explains how this critical, but murky part of the financial system works, and why some banks say the crunch could have been prevented. Illustration: Jacob Reynolds for The Wall Street Journal

Fed repo operations are a longstanding tool the central bank uses to help it control the federal-funds rate, which in turn influences the overall cost of credit, to achieve the central bank’s inflation and job goals.

Fed repo operations take in Treasury, mortgage and agency securities in what is effectively a loan to banks, collateralized by the bonds. Primary dealers pay the Fed interest for the repo loans and are capped on what they can individually borrow.

The New York Fed also announced on Friday an accelerated pace of $50 billion in Treasury purchases as part of the effort announced on Thursday to move what had been $60 billion per month in Treasury bill buying into longer-dated securities. Some observers said that while this change may have not attracted the same level of attention, it may go farther in improving troubled functioning in Treasury markets.

If UM has the authority to force students out of the dorms, then they have the authority to allow students to change their class status to pass/fail and order professors to post-pone assignment deadlines. A professor shouldn't be finding out students are being forced out of their dorms via student email. All professors should've been made aware of this situation by President Schlissel directly.

All it says was that children were involved in human to human spread of the virus, but that could be from parent to child.

Also, Children, by virtue of having milder illness and being less commonly infected are most likely not a major factor in spreading the virus, only 1.3% of infections in Italy and \~2% of infections in China involve children  <19 years.

And this from Japan.

>What our short analysis shows is that children are less likely to be    diagnosed as cases, and moreover, the risk of disease given exposure    among children appears to be low. Both the overall risk and the    conditional risk of disease given exposure are likely to be the highest    among adults aged from 50-69 years.

They're saying fewer children have been diagnosed with Covid-19 and they seem to be less likely to catch the disease if exposed. It is likely, in Japan, that most of the epidemic is spread by adults, 50-69 years. These are both more likely to be sick and mobile.

And

>The finding contradicts other widely circulating respiratory viral infections, e.g. seasonal influenza and respiratory syncytial virus infection, to which children are known to act as the focal host of transmission.

Children are important in spreading Flu, that's not true for Covid-19.

Dr. Bruce Aylward (head of the WHO team that visited China) said the Chinese found very very few cases of a child infecting an adult, it was almost always the other way around.

Reference:

Mizumoto,    K., Omori, R. and Nishiura, H., 2020. Age specificity of cases and    attack rate of novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19). medRxiv.

Edit:

>""Furthermore, the results of this study provide strong evidence for human-to-human transmission as children were unlikely to visit the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market where the early adult patients were reported to obtain 2019-nCoV.""

Since you mentioned Coronavirus and it's been on my mind a lot recently, back in the early days of medicine, the belief was that diseases were spread by ""bad air"" which is why plague doctor masks were shaped like a bird's beak-- they contained a blend of herbs, spices, and incense thought to purify the air. They also thought that, since diseased people exude bad air, maybe locking them up away from everyone else would prevent the bad air from spreading. So they started keeping plague victims separate from the human population for a period of 40 days, or, in Itallian, Quaranta. Thus was born the quarantine.

Edit: Just re-read it and realized it sounds like I'm implying plague victims weren't human. Leaving it in."

Ellis and Vavrek arrived in Miami on Thursday, March 5. By then, only three people in Florida and 200-some others across the United States had tested positive for the highly contagious and potentially lethal virus. They both left Miami on Monday, March 9.

Miami, of course, was a rollicking time. Ellis, Vavrek and their four friends packed into crowded clubs and roped-off beachfront parties, dancing shoulder to shoulder with their fellow festival-goers. They weren’t shy about their affection for one another, kissing and hugging as they enjoyed what Ellis at the time assumed would be “the last big party event in the country"" as other festivals were called off or postponed in the wake of the escalating public health crisis.

But they “started to see the writing on the wall,” Ellis said, as soon as they arrived.
“There were tons of hand sanitizer being rolled out. There were a lot of warnings and things going on that seemed ominous,” he said. “But we were already there and it was just like, ‘Jesus, this is probably going to be a disaster.’ ""

When he got back home to Boston on March
 9, Ellis said, he felt “horrible,"" but he just figured he was hungover. Meanwhile, his health seemed to gradually improve. On Tuesday, March 10, his 30th birthday, Ellis had dinner with a friend, another emergency medicine doctor, at Buttermilk & Bourbon in Back Bay. They sat side by side at the bar while the bartender served them. On Friday morning, March 13, he attended an orientation meeting with other doctors, including the medical director, at East Boston Neighborhood Health Center, where he had been planning to moonlight in the emergency department.

But as Friday wore on, Ellis felt worse. By Friday night, he was sicker than he had ever been in his adult life. Meanwhile, he and the five friends he traveled to Miami with exchanged a flurry of alarming text messages in their group chat: They were all unwell and three, including Vavrek, had already been tested for the 
coronavirus and were waiting for their results.
Vavrek, who had begun feeling ill on Wednesday, March 11, left his near-empty office around noon and went home in an Uber. He had the chills, so he covered himself in blankets and went to sleep. At first, Vavrek thought he was just exhausted from his recent travels. Before his trip to Miami, he had been vacationing in Brazil and Peru for two weeks. He redirected his flight from South America to Miami, instead of Seattle, where dozens of new infections and deaths linked to the coronavirus had spiked. But when he woke up on Thursday morning, he had the sweats, a fever, head and body aches. He wondered if he might actually have COVID-19.

That Thursday, Vavrek called his primary care doctor’s office and explained why he might be sick. He was initially told to self-quarantine for seven days, but Vavrek pushed back and asked to get tested for the coronavirus. His doctor must have agreed, because Vavrek got another call later that day, telling him to report to Swedish Medical in Seattle within the hour. Vavrek snapped on a face mask and walked to the hospital, where he was tested for both influenza and COVID-19. The test for the flu quickly came back negative. He was told he would get his results back for the coronavirus test in three to five days.

On the morning of Saturday, March 14, Ellis was still sick with a cough and shortness of breath. A doctor from Washington, D.C., who had traveled to Miami with Ellis and Vavrek texted the group and confirmed that he and his partner, who had also gone on the trip, had tested positive for COVID-19. (The Washington, D.C., doctor declined an interview.) Right away, Ellis knew he had to get tested, too. He alerted his fellowship director and the doctor he had dinner with on his birthday. He made arrangements that evening to get tested at East Boston Neighborhood Health Center.
“It was scary to be honest,” Ellis said. “It was dramatic.”

He pulled up in his car in the ambulance bay, where a health care worker slipped him a face mask through the crack in his window. Then he walked straight to a negative pressure room, where he was forced to communicate to his providers through a phone line. The doctor who came in to examine him wore full protective gear.
“More than anything, I was super embarrassed,” Ellis said. “Just 24 hours before then, I was walking in here, shaking hands — obviously sanitized because we were a little paranoid at that time — but sitting in the same room as everyone.”

He only stayed for an hour. As a physician, he said, he knew he could manage his symptoms at home and didn’t want to risk getting anyone else at the hospital sick. Like Vavrek, Ellis was tested for both influenza and COVID-19. He was told he would hear from the hospital with his test results in three to four days.

Back in Seattle, on the evening of Sunday, March 15, while Vavrek was eating dinner, a blocked number rang his cellphone. He let the call go to voice mail. It was his doctor. When Vavrek called her back, his doctor confirmed he was, indeed, positive for COVID-19.

“I told her I was a little nervous and anxious and she basically said I’m healthy and young and I’m already getting over the symptoms,” Vavrek said. “She flat out said I’m not going to die from this.”
His doctor told him he needed to isolate for at least seven days after getting tested and longer if he still showed symptoms. Vavrek also had to let everyone he could have possibly transmitted the virus to — including his dodgeball league and the friends he partied with in Miami — know about his infection. For Vavrek, the relief of knowing his diagnosis was bittersweet. Before getting tested, he had plans on Wednesday, March 11, to have dinner with his parents for his father’s 65th birthday — but he had to cancel.

“I tried to rest up because I wanted to celebrate his birthday with him and I ended up canceling a couple hours before. At that point I didn’t think I had it; I just thought I was exhausted from the trip,"" he said. “I told them if there’s any small chance that I could have it, the last thing I want to do is pass it on to my dad, who has a history of heart issues, and I’d never be able to forgive myself if I hurt my parents in that way.”

Ellis got his positive test results back in Boston on Tuesday afternoon. He’s feeling much better but he still plans to self-isolate for another 14 days. Then he will be back in the emergency department at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, working on the front lines of the pandemic.

He described feeling “hopeless” when he thinks of all the people who may have gotten caught in their web of transmission.

“It takes five days for symptoms to show up and then it takes three or four days at best for the test results to come back, so that’s nine days of contact with an infinite amount of people,” Ellis said. “And all those people would have to self-quarantine and wait for either symptoms or test results, which would be another nine days.”
He said he’s enraged watching friends and strangers on social media — posing for selfies on their cheap flights, going out to the bars and hosting “quarantine parties” with dozens of people — because they could be unknowingly spreading the virus, too.

“You need to self-quarantine now. I can’t stress it enough. I’ve never been so angry about people not following the rules,” Ellis said. “There’s just no way to prevent this from getting to every corner of the country unless you self-quarantine."""

The Kent State shootings (also known as the May 4 massacre or the Kent State massacre), were the shootings on May 4, 1970, of unarmed college students by the Ohio National Guard at Kent State University in Kent, Ohio, during a mass protest against the bombing in neutral Cambodia by United States military forces. 

Twenty-eight National Guard soldiers fired approximately 67 rounds over a period of 13 seconds, killing four students and wounding nine others, one of whom suffered permanent paralysis.Some of the students who were shot had been protesting against the Cambodian Campaign, which President Richard Nixon announced during a television address on April 30 of that year. Other students who were shot had been walking nearby or observing the protest from a distance.There was a significant national response to the shootings: hundreds of universities, colleges, and high schools closed throughout the United States due to a student strike of 4 million students, and the event further affected public opinion, at an already socially contentious time, over the role of the United States in the Vietnam War.

By Ida Garibaldi 
Ida Garibaldi lives in Vicenza, Italy. She was born in Italy, and, for many years, lived in Alexandria, Virginia.
March 17, 2020 at 7:18 p.m. GMT

My family lives in the Veneto, in Northern Italy, one of the regions worst hit by the novel coronavirus. We are on lockdown. It’s scary. It’s lonely. It’s uncomfortable. And did I mention scary?

I’ll spare you the statistics and the sermons; both are already abundant. But I do want to make one thing clear: If you think that by stocking up your pantries you have absolved yourself from the responsibility of preparing for this virus, you are mistaken. This is a crisis like none before. Be skeptical of both naysayers and doomsayers; there’s no way of knowing how this will end.

The restrictions came upon us slowly but steadily. Within two weeks, our old lives were gone. First the schools closed, then came social distancing. Then the government locked down the hardest-hit areas: no more going in and out of certain provinces; limited movements within the “red zones.” Then the whole country shut down. Most stores closed their doors. People who could were asked to telework; those who could not, and did not have a job related to the continuation of essential services, were placed on part-time schedules or unpaid leave. When we went out, we had to carry a pass explaining our reasons for being outside to show to the law enforcement officers patrolling the streets. The priority became keeping everyone inside, at all times.

For some people, the gradual rollout made these measures hard to accept: Skeptical observers questioned the seriousness of the disease, given that the restrictions were not draconian from the start. And yet without time to adjust to a progressive loss of freedom, we wouldn’t have accepted it. We might have rebelled. Instead, we rallied, coming together as one — protecting each other’s health, even as we could no longer socialize.
Living under these conditions is difficult to describe. We can only leave the house out of medical necessity or to get food. We can go on short walks but not in groups. We can’t hug, kiss or shake hands with anyone outside of our family. We must stay at least four feet from everyone else, at all times.

My family tries to maintain a routine: In the mornings, I home-school our four children, who range from kindergarten to eighth grade, while my husband teleworks. My eldest son’s school was the best prepared for distance learning and began remote lessons from the first week of the lockdown. He gets live lessons, homework, regular interaction with his teachers — and just as importantly, regular interaction with friends, which lessens his sense of isolation. It’s great, really, but it also requires a dedicated laptop and bandwidth from 8:10 a.m. to 2:45 p.m. daily, limiting what everyone else can do online. My other children’s schools, which shut down at the same time, have only started distance learning this week.
In the afternoon, my husband and I both work as best we can, while the children keep themselves busy. With guitars we had on hand and a drum set they built from scratch, they’re putting together a garage band. (Literally — they have to stay in the garage and can’t practice or perform anywhere else.) For the first time in my life, I’ve come to think that having four children sometimes can be less work than having one or two: They can entertain each other.

Counterintuitively, the days somehow end incredibly fast. We are always doing something: organizing lessons, fighting with a malfunctioning printer or about our overloaded WiFi, tutoring each child one-on-one, getting the kids outside, feeding them, drinking coffee, repeat. When, after two or three days, we can’t take the confinement anymore, one of us makes a run to the grocery store to buy fruits and vegetables and whatever else we need. (The stores, at least, are well stocked.) We go out by bike to get some exercise. That, too, is a challenge, because we are always tired.

My mother and sisters, my little niece, my aunt, and cousins live in Lombardy, the region worst affected by the pandemic. If my mother, who is 81 (or almost 81, as she would point out) catches this virus, she will probably die. I speak to and text them frequently, but I don’t know when, or if, I will be able to see them. It’s bizarre: Everyone is going through the same emotions — fear, anger, exhaustion — no matter where we live or what we do. We don’t need many words to know how the other person feels. We end every call with “Forza!” We must keep going.

Yes, most people who become ill will survive. Yes, people younger than 45 will probably be fine. But right now, doctors across Northern Italy have to choose between who gets the respirator and lives, and who does not and dies. Italy’s health system, for all its shortcomings — the long waits for certain tests, some aging buildings, the sometimes crowded hospital wards — is among the best-performing in the Western world. A 2017 report by the World Health Organization, for example, reported that Italian health care has among the lowest mortality rates in Europe and a strong acute-care sector. And yet this virus has overwhelmed the health system of one of the richest areas of the European Union.

Statistics change daily, as the hospitals scramble to build capacity. On Thursday, there were only 737 intensive-care beds open for new coronavirus patients in Lombardy; the region is home to 10 million people, and as of this writing, 16,220 people have tested positive for the disease there. Depending on how many coronavirus patients go into or out of the hospitals each day, if you have a chronic condition or a heart attack or are in a car crash, you might not be able to access care.

Writing this from Italy, I am also writing to you from your own future. From our state of emergency, we have been watching the crisis unfold in the United States with a terrible sense of foreboding. Please stop waiting for others to tell you what to do; stop blaming the government for doing too much or too little. We all have actions we can take to slow the spread of the disease — and ensuring that your own household has enough canned goods and cleaning supplies is not enough. You can do a lot more. You should do a lot more. Stay away from restaurants, gyms, libraries, movie theaters, bars and cafes, yes. But also: Don’t invite people over for dinner, don’t let your kids go on playdates, don’t take them to the playground, don’t let your teenagers out of your sight. They will sneak out with their friends, they will hold hands, they will share their drinks and food. If this seems too much, consider the following: We are not allowed to hold weddings or funerals. We can’t gather to bury our dead.

For us, it might be too late to avoid an incredible loss of life. But if you decide against taking actions because it seems inconvenient, or because you don’t want to look silly, you can’t say you weren’t warned."

SACRAMENTO — 
When it comes to the fight against the coronavirus pandemic, Gov. Gavin Newsom has made clear he’s not concerned that California’s way may be different from that of other states.
While the arrival of the novel coronavirus has prompted governors across the country to issue sweeping statewide orders in the name of public health — legal mandates to cancel school, quarantine the sick and close down businesses — Newsom’s historic directives for the state’s 40 million residents have come with a deliberately light touch.
The Democratic governor has advised schools to consider shuttering in communities with COVID-19 cases, asked event organizers to cancel large gatherings, urged — but not ordered — bars, restaurants, movie theaters and gyms to close their doors and recommended that seniors and people with underlying health conditions shelter at home.
“We’re not some small isolated state. We’re a nation-state,” Newsom told reporters on Sunday. “Santa Clara County’s conditions are extraordinarily different than Tulare. Extraordinarily different than Madera. Or Colusa. And so, while it may be fanciful and comforting by perception standards, for some [who want] one size fits all, that’s not the world in which we view the reality on the ground. There’s no community spread in some communities, there [is] significant community spread in other communities.”
Some have questioned why Newsom isn’t being more aggressive, and whether his softer tone could put the state at a disadvantage.

But to both Republicans and Democrats who have been part of crisis decisions made by other governors, Newsom’s approach so far looks different: They see a chief executive methodically easing Californians into a new way of life as more drastic quarantine measures begin in counties inundated with cases of the virus.

“He’s been very slow to act authoritarian,” said Rob Stutzman, a Republican consultant and former advisor to Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger. “He’s been very intentional that these are his directives. This is what he’s asking and he’s expressing optimism that people will comply because that is how serious the situation is. In the U.S., I think that’s a very important tone to take because people will not take well to having their freedoms restricted.”

Newsom has described differences between his actions and those of other governors as a “nuance” and said California is too large and its counties are too distinct for a singular approach. As a former mayor, Newsom has repeatedly said that he’s responding with a “bottom-up” approach in a state known for a governing model that gives local leaders a wide berth to take the lead in their communities.
California’s public health system largely relies on county public health officers to respond to outbreaks. Counties have issued requirements to their residents that often go above and beyond state guidelines — something Newsom said he’s encouraged in areas hardest hit by the virus.

The state also practices a system of mutual aid during disasters, in which locals officials serve as the first line of response on the ground and look to the state to provide guidance or fill in the gaps when they need help. The state can turn to the federal government to aid in recovery, often for financial support.


Susan Kennedy, a former top aide to Govs. Gray Davis and Arnold Schwarzenegger, said the system works.
“The locals will tell you what the problems are instead of having the state coming in thinking they know how to solve the problem,” Kennedy said. “This kind of communication in the middle of a disaster is critical. We practice for if you have a gap, you ring the bell and we’re right behind you.”

Still, there have been calls for the state’s actions in the current crisis to be more bold. Leah Simon-Weisberg, legal director of the Alliance of Californians for Community Empowerment, said Newsom needs to do more to halt evictions statewide and help people who are under threat of losing their homes, especially if they aren’t working due to closures and other government action.
Newsom took action to allow cities and counties to impose moratoriums on residential evictions. Simon-Weisberg said local communities already have the power to pause evictions. She said that requiring each jurisdiction to adopt eviction bans would take too long to help everyone in need and demand a high level of intervention from advocates who are working with limited resources or are on home quarantine.

“It’s really being tone-deaf,” she said. “I just think this is when he has to be a leader and just pause all of the evictions.”
Newsom said Tuesday that he would take additional steps if he felt local jurisdictions were failing to protect their residents from eviction."

Dr. Joshua Ellis, a medical education fellow and emergency medicine physician at Boston’s Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, was excited to celebrate his 30th birthday in Miami with five of his close friends.
They had been planning the trip to Florida since late fall — long before the novel coronavirus was even a blip on anyone’s radar. They rented a house on Ocean Drive, steps away from beautiful South Beach. They bought tickets to the Winter Party Festival, a wild, week-long event that brings thousands of gay men to Miami’s hotels, nightclubs, bars, and beaches to raise money for LGBTQ groups in South Florida.

Ellis and his friends traveled to Miami in early March — days before the cascade of shutdowns, curfews, and closures that would swiftly upend American life — from all over the country: Seattle, Denver, Boston, Washington, D.C.

Since then, all six of them have gotten sick and with the same symptoms: chills, sweats, fatigue, shortness of breath. Four of them, including Ellis, already have tested positive for COVID-19, the respiratory disease caused by the coronavirus.
“All six have shown the exact same symptoms at different times. So everyone in the household got it for sure — I am 100 percent confident; it’s too coincidental,” Ellis said in an interview this week, his nose running and voice hoarse. “The fear, though, is a lot of them were actively enjoying their social life [before they felt sick] . . . going to bars, going to dinners, going and hanging out at friends’ houses, quarantining with friends.”

Ellis’s story illustrates just how quickly the coronavirus spreads between close contacts and how easily an infected person can unwittingly expose others to the virus in the absence of symptoms. New research based on data from China suggests that undetected carriers of the virus are fueling the explosive growth of the outbreak. A study published in the journal Science on Monday found that people with undocumented infections, often with mild or no symptoms, were responsible for 79 percent of confirmed cases in the early stages of China’s epidemic.

At a White House press briefing Wednesday, Dr. Deborah Birx, the president’s coronavirus response coordinator, warned “there may be a disproportional number of infections” among young adults who, while not as likely to suffer severely, still pose a danger to others, especially the elderly and those with underlying health conditions.

Ellis and another friend, Adam Vavrek, interviewed for this story said they felt groggy, but not ill after they returned home from Miami. In the meantime, they lived their lives normally before the onset of symptoms. Ellis didn’t have any shifts at the hospital, but he went out to dinner with a friend on Tuesday, March 10. He attended an orientation for new staff at East Boston Neighborhood Health Center on Friday, March 13, just hours before he started feeling sick.

Vavrek, a 35-year-old marketing employee at a large tech company in Seattle, visited his company’s office and played in a dodgeball league, also on Tuesday. He was at work on Wednesday, March 11, when he suddenly got the chills.

“I think a lot of people my age are thinking they might get it, but they’re young and healthy enough to fight it. But I think what they don’t consider is who they could potentially pass it on to, others who might not be able to bounce back as quickly,"" Vavrek said."

Thanks for the question, and you are hitting on something really important. As you’ve rightly pointed out, California has more confirmed cases in the 18-64 than the 65+ category. That’s partly because of the large age range.   
Of note: health officials say that older adults (60/65+) are at higher *risk* from COVID-19. That’s because younger people have stronger immune systems. Older individuals and people with compromised immune systems are more threatened by COVID-19.

There was a thread yesterday about a guy whose GP diagnosed him with pneumonia, which is life threatening, but the ED refused to treat him because he ""didn't meet the Coronavirus criteria."" 

In that case, the guy did meet the criteria, but he didn't even want a test, just wanted treatment for bacterial pneumonia. If you're in that situation what do you do? Politely go home and die or lie?

I've had exactly the same problem over the last few days. Severe respiratory infection (thankfully) recovering. I'm on immunosuppressants so it's a big deal.

This was going to happen with or without coronavirus, maybe to a lesser extent, but it was going to happen.  Trump looks at the market as a measure of his presidency, when it's going up at least.  He'll try to blame this on Obama, but it's his baby now.  

I hope three major realizations come from this.  First, finally put a nail in the coffin of supply side, trickle down economics.  Second, look around and see how the earth is getting cleaner.  Perhaps we'll endeavor to keep it clean.  Third, we don't get complacent as voters when things are good.  When we do, crooks step in and raid the treasury.  Democracy requires constant vigilance.

Trump's overall overt racism empowers many of his supporters, and just Americans in general. A different example that has nothing to do with COVID-19, but a couple months ago a customer made a comment that she assumed we would prefer cash payment rather than credit card ""because you know, you're Asian.""

Restaurants can only serve takeout, delivery,  drive thru.  Voluntary curfew of 8PM-5AM. No gatherings over 50 or you get in trouble with the police.  This includes funerals,  weddings, and birthday parties (we're a state that tends to go very big for children's birthday parties). Many funeral homes across the country are not allowing wakes,  and even not allowing the spouse to see the deceased due to strict protocol they are personally enacting because of the virus. Medical workers in family still working,  everyone else with office jobs have been ordered to work from home by their companies.  Exponential growth is going to happen everywhere and we need to slow it down now. Because of these attitudes I fear we are too late.

2020-03-18,manitoid,CoronavirusColorado,12,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoronavirusColorado/comments/fkzl82/independent_denverarea_restaurants_lay_off_more/fkvro0r/,">A survey of independent restaurants in the Denver area that was taken one day after the state and city mandated closure of in-facility dining showed that local eateries have laid off 81.1% of their staffs already — a number that represents some 5,000 workers and is expected to rise in the coming weeks.

>The survey, done by industry group EatDenver, puts stark numbers onto the already bleak big-picture unemployment scenarios that have been laid out by restaurant and hospitality leaders as leaders try to contain the coronavirus spread. And they mirror anecdotal evidence of what restaurant-industry layoffs statewide are appearing to be in an industry that employs some 294,000 people, though layoffs in mountain areas that have even stricter restrictions on people’s movement are higher, Colorado Restaurant Association CEO Sonia Riggs said.

>The survey results detailed by EatDenver Executive Director Katie Lazor come as unemployment-benefit applications doubled in just one day Tuesday to 6,800. On Wednesday, Gov. Jared Polis announced a new state-run relief fund that will seek to aid workers who have lost their jobs as well as fund more cleaning and medical supplies for group-living facilities and other nonprofits working with vulnerable populations.

>While a number of restaurants have pivoted to take-out, delivery or drive-through orders — all of which are still allowed under restrictions, the EatDenver survey of 33 restaurants and restaurant groups representing more than 120 units found that the majority have not. Sixty-nine of those eateries closed altogether after one to two weeks in which their revenue dropped anywhere from 25% to 75% as diners began to stay in and as revenue-generating in-restaurant events canceled left and right.

>Jeff Osaka — owner of the local Sushi-Rama chain, Osaka Ramen, 12@Madison and The Empire Lounge & Restaurant — looked at transitioning to to-go service in the short term but then determined there was no feasible path to staying open with that model. All of the concepts will remain closed for at least two months, coinciding with Denver’s ban on in-restaurant dining until May 11 at the earliest, and will result in the loss of about 200 jobs.

>“This is one of the most difficult decisions I've had to face in my 30 years in the industry, and as a proud member of the Colorado's hospitality community, I know we will persevere,” Osaka said in an e-mail Wednesday. “It is this belief that will set us up to best serve everyone — our staff and the public — in the future.""

>Polis, who has owned and operated a number of businesses, acknowledged how difficult the restrictions are for businesses and workers. But he emphasized that the steps are necessary to contain the spread of the virus that already has infected 183 Coloradans and resulted in two deaths here, believing that doing so will stop what could be far greater economic and population-health harm if COVID-19 reaches even more people.

>To that end, the Democratic governor said at a media briefing Wednesday morning that he has considered implementing a “shelter-in-place” order like some other parts of the country have done, limiting the movements of people outside their home to essential work and medical care. However, while he is “looking at all the public-health options that are on the table,” he said, he would rather stick now with the restrictions on gathering of 50 more people and the closing of public areas from casinos to theaters that already are in place for at least 30 days.

>“All of the additional social-distancing measures that are applicable are being looked at, balanced with how long people can endure them and their effect on the economy,” he said.

>The new relief fund, named Help Colorado Now, already is seeded with $2.8 million — money donated by Vail Resorts (NYSE: MTN) CEO Rob Katz and his wife, former DaVita Inc. (NYSE: DVA) CEO Kent Thiry and his wife, the Denver Broncos, the Colorado Health Foundation, Wells Fargo (NYSE: WFC) and others, Polis said. It will support prevention through distribution of medical and cleaning supplies, economic impact through things like food for the unemployed and child care for essential workers and recovery through the funding of behavioral-health needs.

>Polis encouraged laid-off workers to apply for unemployment benefits, and he said the Colorado Department of Labor and Employment has just added a patch that got in the way of its online access working effectively yesterday. He said also that he continues to ask Colorado’s congressional delegation to back an economic-recovery package for workers and businesses and supports the idea of the federal government issuing $1,000 or $2,000 per month to individuals until coronavirus restrictions can be lifted.

>In the meantime, restaurants statewide will have to decide whether to move their businesses to a to-go format or to shutter them temporarily. Statewide, Riggs said she’s hearing that about half are giving it a try for off-premise eating only and half are shutting down for now.

>Brad Ritter, owner of Carmine’s on Penn at 92 S. Pennsylvania Street, made the brutal decision Tuesday of laying off 26 workers from his family-style Italian restaurant, compensating each of them through the end of this pay period and sending each home with three to four meals. But he and three of his managers stayed on and will begin offering to-go meals on Friday that are ordered in advance every Wednesday through Sunday from 4 to 7 p.m., hoping to make just enough money to pay his lease and taxes until dine-in restrictions lift.

>Carmine’s has done takeout — it’s an especially popular option each Christmas Eve, generating thousands of dollars of revenue in one night — but it’s only represented about 5% of sales in the past. Ritter, however, chose to try this path for now because it not only will allow him to keep a handful of workers employed and have the restaurant in better shape to hire its old staff back eventually but because he feels the need to offer more food options to the tens of thousands of people around him who are stuck in their homes and need some sort of relief.

>“To make it work, we need to do the volume we do on Christmas Eve every day. So, we’re crossing our fingers and we’re ready to go,” he said, noting that if he can turn any kind of a profit under the new model, he will immediately begin to hire back laid-off workers. “Our lease goes for another 11 years. We want to be sure we use that up.”"

If there is enough interest my plan is to set up in a park with good light and background. I can schedule people into short time blocks with gaps in between to limit exposure to others. We will also be practicing good social distancing, as portraits are usually taken from an appropriate distance. Nobody is spreading coronavirus on my watch!

I can’t drive all over town to do this but depending on where interested folks are located I could try to pick a centrally located park.

Dear WPI Community,

This has been a challenging few weeks - both around the world and here at WPI.  We know that students miss their friends and being in the dynamic learning environment on campus. It is also clear that, despite these unprecedented circumstances, faculty and staff are working incredibly hard to be able to deliver WPI’s education to our students, and to keep our campus operating.

We are all doing our best to keep WPI safe and healthy, and to protect the health of our families and communities in this time of great uncertainty. Whether you are moving your class on-line, ensuring our campus is cleaner than it has ever been, or working remotely to help slow the spread of COVID-19, we greatly appreciate the contributions of all members of the WPI community to help mitigate this crisis. Thank you.

As the seriousness of the COVID-19 outbreak becomes more evident, and based on the best advice of public health professionals, it is clear that WPI must take additional steps to help mitigate the potential spread of the virus by minimizing interpersonal interactions on campus. 

No Reported Coronavirus Cases in Our Community

We know of no member of our community who has tested positive for the virus.  One test has come back negative, and one is pending. The individual with the pending test has not been on the campus since March 6.        

D-term and Spring Semester Courses

While we had very much hoped to be able to re-open the campus for classes later in D-term, it is now clear that it will not happen.   Therefore:

·         All courses will be offered in remote status for the entirety of D-term and the remainder of Spring Semester.  D-Term starts on 3/25 and ends on 5/13 – these dates are unchanged from prior messages.

·         For residential students who have already left campus but have not fully moved out, please do not return to campus at this time. You will not have access to your residence hall. We understand that this decision will raise a number of questions.  You will receive more information from Residential Services in the coming week on plans for you to collect your belongings.  Please give Residential Services time to communicate with you prior to reaching out.  If, after receiving further communication, you still have questions, please email coronavirusquestions@wpi.edu.

·         For students who have previously received permission to remain in the residence halls, we ask that you make every effort to return to your home or permanent residence, taking all of your belongings with you. You will receive specific instructions from Residential Services directly.

·         For students who are unable to depart the campus, more information for you on living and dining will be sent by Residential Services.

·         Residential students not staying on campus will receive a refund for D-term housing and dining. Further details will be shared with you in the coming week.


Commencement

We have not made a final decision on how best to handle Commencement. Given the current situation, though, it is highly likely to be delayed and thus we would not recommend making any travel arrangements at this time. A final decision will be made by the end of March.  We know how important this is for our community and the decision will be taken with great care.

Campus Operations/Remote Work

 The physical WPI campus remains open, but with limited on-site operations.  All WPI employees who can work remotely should do so.  This includes all faculty, staff, research assistants, graduate assistants, and student workers. We greatly appreciate the cooperation we are seeing in response to this guidance, and we know that WPI employees are remarkably resourceful and committed.  Effective immediately and until we notify the community otherwise:

·         All of our employees, including our student workers, will be paid as usual for the rest of the academic year. In the unlikely event that this crisis extends far beyond the end of the academic year, we will be in touch with additional plans as they are made. Know that we are committed to doing all we can to ensure that our faculty, staff, and students come through this crisis together.

·         All events through D-term are cancelled and all meetings should be conducted remotely.

·         No visitors are permitted on campus. Deliveries of essential goods will be permitted.

·         All active academic and staff hiring will be paused with the exception of positions with offers made as of yesterday, March 17th. No further offers of employment should be made at this time. 

 While the above information is current as of this memo, the time to prepare for more severe restrictions on campus operations is now.  We strongly recommend that all employees prepare now for a situation of extended remote work with strict limitations on access to campus.  Although we are not yet there, in the extreme case only emergency personnel with specific credentials and a charge to keep the campus safe and secure will be allowed on campus.

Finally, please take the responsibility each of us has helping to mitigate the impact of this virus seriously. We expect all members of our community to follow CDC guidelines.  This includes contacting your doctor if you have symptoms, engaging in frequent hand washing, maintaining appropriate social distancing, and if warranted, choosing to self-quarantine. Employees who are sick should stay home.  Supervisors should ask sick employees to stay home.

We are regularly updating our coronavirus website, and we ask that you keep referring to the Frequently Asked Questions section. Anyone with additional questions should send those to CoronavirusQuestions@wpi.edu.

These are uncharted waters, but this community is strong.  We are problem solvers and together we will weather this storm. Thanks for all you do for WPI.

So COVID will remain a fact of life until it's vaccinated or herd immunity becomes so robust it becomes something of an afterthought.

That doesn't mean we are in for 18 months of the current status quo. World governments are going to need to thread the needle between mitigating the pandemic and propping up the economy, or we're going to get thrust into a catastrophic global depression that will dwarf the pandemic in terms of human suffering and chaos. 

Herd immunity will rise as the virus spreads and people recover. Treatments will continue to be refined and perfected. The ""multiple waves"" will occur as we slowly roll back to action one step at a time. People are not going to be crouched in their apartments watching Netflix and eating cold soup for two years while scientists run in circles trying to successfully vaccinate a coronavirus."

“The panic produced by these fearmongers is likely helping spread the disease, as massive crowds rush into Walmart and Costco for that last roll of toilet paper.”

“People should ask themselves whether this coronavirus “pandemic” could be a big hoax, with the actual danger of the disease massively exaggerated by those who seek to profit – financially or politically – from the ensuing panic.”

“That is not to say the disease is harmless. Without question people will die from coronavirus. Those in vulnerable categories should take precautions to limit their risk of exposure.

>[Kevin McHugh](https://bioengineering.rice.edu/people/faculty/kevin-mchugh), an assistant professor of bioengineering at Rice since this summer, and a team at his previous institution, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, report in a cover story in [Science Translational Medicine](https://stm.sciencemag.org/content/11/523/eaay7162) on their development of quantum-dot tags that fluoresce with information after they’re injected as part of a vaccination.  
>  
>The tags are incorporated in only some of the array of sugar-based microneedles on a patch. When the needles dissolve in about two minutes, they deliver the vaccine and leave the pattern of tags just under the skin, where they become something like a bar-code tattoo.  
>  
>Instead of ink, this highly specific medical record consists of copper-based quantum dots embedded in biocompatible, micron-scale capsules. Their near-infrared dye is invisible, but the pattern they set can be read and interpreted by a customized smartphone.

>The two-year project is aimed at the 1.5 million preventable deaths that result from a lack of vaccinations, primarily in developing nations.

>**“The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation came to us and said, ‘Hey, we have a real problem — knowing who’s vaccinated,’”** said McHugh, who was recruited to join Rice with funding from the [Cancer Prevention and Research Institute of Texas](https://www.cprit.state.tx.us/). “They said, ‘We go on vaccination campaigns where people get into Hummers, drive to a rural village, set up a tent and start immunizing people, but they don’t always know who’s been immunized before and what vaccines are still needed.”  
>  
>Parents often don’t know their children’s vaccination histories, McHugh said. “So our idea was to put the record on the person,” he said. “This way, later on, people can scan over the area to see what vaccines have been administered and give only the ones still needed.  
>  
>“There are two sides to this,” he said. “First, is that you don’t administer unnecessary vaccines, which has a cost. But even bigger, you don’t leave people underimmunized and at risk of getting an infectious disease.”  
>  
>McHugh said the team worked with a bioethicist to be sure the patients’ data remains protected. “She said we’re on solid ethical ground as long as people can opt out, like getting the patch with only the vaccine. Also, the patch with quantum dots only contains information about the vaccine received. It doesn’t tell you anything else about the person.”  
>  
>The square-centimeter patches hold up to 16 tiny needles. “They don’t go very deep, which makes them theoretically painless and a lot easier for kids,” McHugh said. “They’re like putting on a bandage.”  
>  
>Because the 1.5-millimeter needles disintegrate in the skin, no biohazardous sharps remain for disposal, he said. **Testing in model skin in strong light showed the 4-nanometer dots should be readable for at least five years.**  
>  
>McHugh plans to continue his work on the technology at Rice. “There are so many aspects to this particular project that we need nanotechnologists, bacteriologists, chemists and computer scientists,” he said. “So this is certainly something I’m thinking about for my lab here.”

Sounds all noble until you consider Bill's additional statements made during his recent IAMA and his funding of the [ID2020](https://id2020.org/alliance) alliance trying to eliminate anonymity on the Internet, [see here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/fksnbf/im_bill_gates_cochair_of_the_bill_melinda_gates/fkupg49/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf).

> Eventually we will have some digital certificates to show who has recovered or been tested recently or when we have a vaccine who has received it. 

It's pretty obvious all this shit ties together. One of the partners of ID2020 is a vaccine manufacturer, for crying out load. From their site:

>Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance brings together public and private sectors with the shared goal of creating equal access to new and underused vaccines for children living in the world’s poorest countries. Dr. Seth Berkley, CEO of Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, sits on our Executive Board. 

Why would a vaccine alliance organization be on the board of an Internet Identity project? Because they want to tag and track us like cattle.  5G is going to make the Internet of Things possible, and once everyone's got the vaccine with the tracking crystals, all they need to do then is modify regulations so that you can't participate in society without it, and flip a switch, and there you have it.  Revelation.  Mark of the Beast.  

> 11Then I saw another beast rising out of the earth. It had two horns like a lamb and it spoke like a dragon.12It exercises all the authority of the first beast in its presence, and makes the earth and its inhabitants worship the first beast, whose mortal wound was healed.13It performs great signs, even making fire come down from heaven to earth in front of people,14and by the signs that it is allowed to work in the presence of the beast it deceives those who dwell on earth, telling them to make an image for the beast that was wounded by the sword and yet lived.15And it was allowed to give breath to the image of the beast, so that the image of the beast might even speak and might cause those who would not worship the image of the beast to be slain.16**Also it causes all, both small and great, both rich and poor, both free and slave, to be marked on the right hand or the forehead,17so that no one can buy or sell unless he has the mark,** that is, the name of the beast or the number of its name.18This calls for wisdom: let the one who has understanding calculate the number of the beast, for it is the number of a man, and his number is 666.

AND people are using the word quarantine incorrectly. If you are allowed to go take a walk around the park, grocery shopping or just choose to work from home instead of going in to work you are not under quarantine, you are staying at home! Quarantine is when you can’t leave quarantine and it’s enforced.

> He first deferred to a colleague, then took the chance to speak again, defending China’s handling of the epidemic. “It is very difficult, given the facts,” he said, “to say that China was hiding.” [Source](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/asia_pacific/chinese-officials-note-serious-problems-in-coronavirus-response-the-world-health-organization-keeps-praising-them/2020/02/08/b663dd7c-4834-11ea-91ab-ce439aa5c7c1_story.html) (softpaywall, open in private browser if you're blocked)"

People will start to die and trump will increasingly point to China as the culprit. The population will be unemployed, mourning their friends and family who have passed, losing their savings and houses and generally being angry and seeking vengeance.

Trump will run on making China pay and probably deporting or removing rights from Chinese and Asian Americans. 

The dnc will hand wring and fret over the ubi and other shit trump tries to push through, and will be seen as pedantic and preventing people from getting the help trump wants to give them.

They will continue to run on a super moderate platform and wanting to return to normal after so much chaos. But the world will have changed enough that people will just see this as empty.

The dnc will also join in on anti Chinese sentiment but from a woke-scold anti authoritarian standpoint rather than overt xenophobia.

Trump will win, shit will get more racist. Globalism will be blamed for the spread of coronavirus. It will be portrayed as an attempt by the rest of the world to weaken the great American people. Immigration and overseas travel will be strictly controlled or outright banned. 

The working class, who suffered most throughout the virus and economic collapse, will have to resort to illegal means more and more to survive. Many will be poc and will be pointed to as more of what is holding America back from full recovery, and will be punished accordingly. How dare they do this after trump gave them so much? They do not have the values that make America great, and thus are not American. Enemies of America who don’t deserve its compassion.

The fascist transformation will be complete.

The issue here is ORIGIN. The coronavirus (I.e. Wuhan virus) originated in China. At first it was refered to as these names until being more socially acceptable to use COVID-19 as its name. 

The issue came when Chinese officials started claiming US military was responsible for the virus and blamed the virus and its origin on the US. Next, people brought up the Spanish flu. Which was named Spanish flu because that is where it killed many people, but not where it originated from. Origin of Spanish flu seems to still be up for debate, but it is believed to be from China or America from what I read.

So, the idea here is to avoid prejudice or racist feelings by removing the Spanish name becsue the virus in fact did not originate in Spain and people dont want the confusion over the name to lead to racism."

The report, issued Wednesday by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, found that — as in other countries — the oldest patients had the greatest likelihood of dying and of being hospitalized. But of the 508 patients known to have been hospitalized, 38 percent were notably younger — between 20 and 54. And nearly half of the 121 patients who were admitted to intensive care units were adults under 65, the C.D.C. reported.

“I think everyone should be paying attention to this,” said Stephen S. Morse, a professor of epidemiology at Columbia University’s Mailman School of Public Health. “It’s not just going to be the elderly. There will be people age 20 and up. They do have to be careful, even if they think that they’re young and healthy.”

The findings served to underscore an appeal issued Wednesday at a White House briefing by Dr. Deborah Birx, a physician and State Department official who is a leader of the administration’s coronavirus task force. Citing similar reports of young adults in Italy and in France being hospitalized and needing intensive care, Dr. Birx implored the millennial generation to stop socializing in groups and to take care to protect themselves and others.

https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32077115

>BACKGROUND:
Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection has been widely spread. We aim to investigate the clinical characteristic and allergy status of patients infected with SARS-CoV-2.

METHODS:
Electronic medical records including demographics, clinical manifestation, comorbidities, laboratory data, and radiological materials of 140 hospitalized COVID-19 patients, with confirmed result of SARS-CoV-2 viral infection, were extracted and analyzed.

RESULTS:
An approximately 1:1 ratio of male (50.7%) and female COVID-19 patients was found, with an overall median age of 57.0 years. All patients were community-acquired cases. Fever (91.7%), cough (75.0%), fatigue (75.0%), and gastrointestinal symptoms (39.6%) were the most common clinical manifestations, whereas hypertension (30.0%) and diabetes mellitus (12.1%) were the most common comorbidities. Drug hypersensitivity (11.4%) and urticaria (1.4%) were self-reported by several patients. Asthma or other allergic diseases were not reported by any of the patients. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD, 1.4%) patients and current smokers (1.4%) were rare. Bilateral ground-glass or patchy opacity (89.6%) was the most common sign of radiological finding. Lymphopenia (75.4%) and eosinopenia (52.9%) were observed in most patients. Blood eosinophil counts correlate positively with lymphocyte counts in severe (r = .486, P < .001) and nonsevere (r = .469, P < .001) patients after hospital admission. Significantly higher levels of D-dimer, C-reactive protein, and procalcitonin were associated with severe patients compared to nonsevere patients (all P < .001).

CONCLUSION:
Detailed clinical investigation of 140 hospitalized COVID-19 cases suggests eosinopenia together with lymphopenia may be a potential indicator for diagnosis. **Allergic diseases, asthma, and COPD are not risk factors for SARS-CoV-2 infection. Older age, high number of comorbidities, and more prominent laboratory abnormalities were associated with severe patients.**

Instead, try to focus on some hobbies you can do at home to take your mind off of it, like reading a good book (or listening to an audiobook), playing a video game, watching tv/movies, doing a puzzle, ect.

I am trying to reduce my digestion of Coronavirus news because of this, and I don't have bad anxiety, but over time it starts to weight on you to read the negativity on a constant basis.

As of now Solano is the ONLY county not under SIP!! Even though the Wuhan and Diamond Princess Cruise evacuees were sent to Travis Air Force Base in Solano. Even though the first community transmission case in the US was seen in a Solano County hospital. Even though two healthcare workers from said hospital and two people from Travis AFB tested positive recently. People are still out and about. Shops are busy. [Not all of them are being sanitized](https://twitter.com/_swimshady_/status/1240383699964661760) The Solano Mall is still open.

The Solano Public Health Officer is **Dr. Bela Matyas**
In his video announcement he claims that as long as you don't go near someone who is sneezing or coughing, and avoid touching your face you won't get infected.(even though talking can contaminate the air and droplets can stay in the air for 3 hours) He says that Solano (8 confirmed cases yesterday, down from 9 confirmed on monday?) has less cases than other Bay Area Counties even though nearby Sonoma County issued an SIP and has 2 cases (as of yesterday). And even though a doctor should know that barely anyone here is getting tested.

**This hack is seriously a doctor and our Public Health Officer.**

Because of the gross incompetence of these officials, Solano county's number of cases will only inflate faster, even more so than the other counties.
 The Public Health Administrative Office gave me a number to call- **the solano public health coronavirus warmline 707-784-8988**

I urge everyone in the California Bay Area/Sac Area to call that number and complain about how poorly Solano County officials and Bela Matyas are handling this pandemic, if they don't answer, leave a message.

I'm just royally screwed in every way here without the government mandating larger employers give more time off. I cannot ever quarantine until the government shuts our nonessential business down.

If you scroll through the comments on this thread, Bill Gates did an AMA today about one of his foundations and the work/research they’re doing with the Coronavirus. It’s not a garbage study by any means, but they failed to account for some very important variables. Mr. Gates does a much better job explaining it than I ever could, so I urge you to seek out his AMA. He’s also not the only one to comment on this study. 

But let’s say the study was perfect. It’s saying the best we can do is go through cycles of lockdown and normalcy, over and over, until there’s a vaccine, a treatment, or there’s enough of the population with immunity that would make spread slow and easily managed. It’s of course not ideal, but not nearly as oppressive as 18 consecutive months under quarantine. And it’s important to note that with each cycle, there would be less and less cases.

The Chinese government has made massive efforts to contain the spread of virus, and short of South Korea they’ve probably been the single most successful country to have a major outbreaks and handle it.  As I literally just told you, there are significant periods of time when you can’t detect the virus but people are still contagious, and as a result of that fact and the fact that we live in an incredibly globalized world the virus crossing the globe was basically inevitable after it got outside of Wuhan.

For someone who says they’re speaking straight facts you seem to have a really poor grasp on the realities of this disease and it’s transmission.

It has been the case for many weeks now.

As of March 18th 2020, there is ABSOLUTELY NO mention of ""Chinese flu"", and even ""coronavirus"" has fallen out of fashion, except in broader terms about the pandemic. Your (great) post got me curious so I did a bit of digging...

 [Here](https://www.huffingtonpost.ca/entry/coronavirus-name_ca_5e3367d1c5b6f2623326a1c8) is an excellent early point of view on the naming convention debate (dated Jan. 30th 2020) from the Canadian Press.

This is how the new virus' name evolved in Canada, on the English language media side:

- first ""Wuhan virus"", or moniker akin to its origin
- then ""Chinese flu"", albeit not as often as the previous
- around the new year/mid-January, ""new coronavirus"" was getting more traction 
- by the end of January, ""coronavirus"" was established as the prevalent name in all media
- February, we hear different ""2019-nCoV"" iterations, or techy-sounding names as we get more scientific information
- February 11th, the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV) announced “severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)” as the name of the new virus. Same day, the WHO (World Health Organization) announced “COVID-19” as the name of this new disease, to highlight a distinction between the virus and the disease it causes in humans.
- since then, all major news sources report on ""COVID-19""

In French, it followed a similar pattern except the French language is highly normative and codefies its vocabulary usages very rapidly. I sensed a linguistic malaise from official sources in using coronavirus, as if they felt it wasn't specific enough. We thus saw ""nouveau coronavirus"" for a little bit in the beginning. French media in Canada have their own guidelines, stemming mainly from the OQLF in Québec but in this case, once France began using exclusively ""COVID-19"" in mid-February, they adopted the name right away. One peculiar linguistic observation to be made is that early on, the maculine gender was used (ie : le COVID-19).

Presumably, this is because most viruses have a masculine gender (le VIH, le virus du Nil, le SRAS). After a couple weeks however, they began using a feminine gender (ie : la COVID-19), as purists noted this name designates a DISEASE and not a virus. The word for ""disease"" being ""maladie"" (feminine) in French, the press now goes with  ""la (maladie) COVID-19"". They still use ""coronavirus"" when talking about the global pandemic, or as a generic condition, much like in English.

I cannot find a Canadian French media source using ""Chinese flu"" or its equivalents anytime in 2020. This is interesting as a language does not stop at a border (much like a virus). If « Chinese flu » were commonly accepted by the people in Northern USA as a valid expression, it would have resurfaced across state lines. However, from what I gather in everyday conversations, emails, news, and official government briefs, only « coronavirus » and « COVID-19 » are being used in Canada. Maybe the situation is different in BC or Alberta though, I could use input from western redditors.

This leads me to believe that ""Chinese flu"" is purely ideological from the Trump administration, as it never caught on North of the 49th parallel."

Front-line medical workers are complaining of inadequate testing and shortages of protective gear, raising fears that doctors and nurses may be spreading the virus or will be forced into isolation as the demand for care peaks.

Most worrisome is the limited supply of ventilators to sustain what is expected to be a soaring number of patients in coming weeks, putting doctors in the position of deciding which ones to treat and which ones to let die."

I think it’s pretty obvious that it is meant to be for children who usually get meals at school that their parents could otherwise not afford, or for parents who have had their hours cut massively due to the virus. That has been the general sentiment with things like this. It’s a GOOD thing that you can afford to feed your family! Do that. As a grad student who is currently out of a job due to coronavirus, I certainly don’t have a lot of money. I still wouldn’t use an offer like this unless I truly lacked the money to pay for food for my child. Doing so might cause them to discontinue a program that some people really needed. I think that they generally expect people to understand this, and not take advantage of things that they do not need."
