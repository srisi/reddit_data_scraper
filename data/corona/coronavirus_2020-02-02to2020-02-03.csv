These proteases are required to ""chop"" up the long virus proteins that are generated when they hijack a cell's machinery to make copies of themselves. These chopped up protein segments are assembled to create copies of the virus.

The HIV drug binds to the protease enzyme to inhibit its function, which subsequently inhibits the virus's ability to assemble copies of itself.

I recall Chinese scientists were able to determine the 3D structure of the ""3CL protease"" of the 2019-nCoV virus, which may be a target of interest for the use of these retroviral HIV drugs. Because HIV drugs are designed particularly for HIV, I imagine they may not work completely effectively for this coronavirus strain, but with further research on the structure of this virus's protease enzyme, modifications to this drug may improve its binding affinity with the enzyme's active site to improve inhibition.

I went into a bit more detail in the way that these proteases typically work in an earlier comment I made last week, for anyone who is interested.

HIV is a famously mutant virus. But, it is not over use, it is misuse. If you only take half the treatment, or stop and start, the ones with a bit of resistance get to survive and multiply, carrying their resistance forward. That said, at least in the case of HIV, it doesnt change the global population of the virus much, just the population in those particular patients. There's probably a lot of selective evolutive pressures and population dynamics I'd have to check to be able to understand and explain to you exactly why that happens, but my point is that HIV ""lives"" a very different ""life"" than the flu and coronavirus, so my extrapolation isnt too helpful in this case.

The Wuhan coronavirus spreading from China is now likely to become a pandemic that circles the globe, according to many of the world’s leading infectious disease experts.
The prospect is daunting. A pandemic — an ongoing epidemic on two or more continents — may well have global consequences, despite the extraordinary travel restrictions and quarantines now imposed by China and other countries, including the United States.
Scientists do not yet know how lethal the new coronavirus is, however, so there is uncertainty about how much damage a pandemic might cause. But there is growing consensus that the pathogen is readily transmitted between humans.
The Wuhan coronavirus is spreading more like influenza, which is highly transmissible, than like its slow-moving viral cousins, SARS and MERS, scientists have found.

“It’s very, very transmissible, and it almost certainly is going to be a pandemic,” said Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease.


“But will it be catastrophic? I don’t know.”
In the last three weeks, the number of lab-confirmed cases has soared from about 50 in China to 14,000 in 23 countries; there have been over 300 deaths, all but one in China.

But various epidemiological models estimate that the real number of cases is 100,000 or even more. While that expansion is not as rapid as that of flu or measles, it is an enormous leap beyond what virologists saw when SARS and MERS emerged.
When SARS was vanquished in July 2003 after spreading for nine months, only 8,098 cases had been confirmed. MERS has been circulating since 2012, but there have been only about 2,500 known cases.

The Wuhan coronavirus spreading from China is now likely to become a pandemic that circles the globe, according to many of the world’s leading infectious disease experts.

The Wuhan coronavirus is spreading more like influenza, which is highly transmissible, than like its slow-moving viral cousins, SARS and MERS, scientists have found.

The biggest uncertainty now, experts said, is how many people around the world will die. SARS killed about 10 percent of those who got it, and MERS now kills about one of three.
The 1918 “Spanish flu” killed only about 2.5 percent of its victims — but because it infected so many people and medical care was much cruder then, 20 to 50 million died.
By contrast, the highly transmissible H1N1 “swine flu” pandemic of 2009 killed about 285,000, fewer than seasonal flu normally does, and had a relatively low fatality rate, estimated at .02 percent.

The mortality rate for known cases of the Wuhan coronavirus has been running about 2 percent, although that is likely to drop as more tests are done and more mild cases are found.


It is “increasingly unlikely that the virus can be contained,” said Dr. Thomas R. Frieden, a former director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention who now runs Resolve to Save Lives, a nonprofit devoted to fighting epidemics.

“It is therefore likely that it will spread, as flu and other organisms do, but we still don’t know how far, wide or deadly it will be.”
In the early days of the 2009 flu pandemic, “they were talking about Armageddon in Mexico,” Dr. Fauci said. (That virus first emerged in pig-farming areas in Mexico’s Veracruz State.) “But it turned out to not be that severe.”


An accurate estimate of the virus’s lethality will not be possible until certain kinds of studies can be done: blood tests to see how many people have antibodies, household studies to learn how often it infects family members, and genetic sequencing to determine whether some strains are more dangerous than others.


Closing borders to highly infectious pathogens never succeeds completely, experts said, because all frontiers are somewhat porous. Nonetheless, closings and rigorous screening may slow the spread, which will buy time for the development of drug treatments and vaccines.
Other important unknowns include who is most at risk, whether coughing or contaminated surfaces are more likely to transmit the virus, how fast the virus can mutate and whether it will fade out when the weather warms."

This is very bad news, as the primary mechanism for protection that people have been using for the past week has been isolation from person-to-person contact. However, during the 2003 SARS outbreak at the [Amoy Gardens housing complex](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/11/12/04-0949_article), 1 person infected over 300 people via the feces route. After depositing infected diarrhea into the toilet, the virus entered the sanitary system. It then transmitted by the following means:

- Dry U-traps in floor drains and toilet systems allowed infected gases to escape into people's bathrooms, depositing on surfaces such as toothbrushes, shower curtains and towels.

- Fans and air systems when bathroom doors were closed created negative pressure, further drawing viral laden gases into living quarters.

- Open windows and prevailing winds carried viral laden air into apartments in nearby towers.

- Roaches, rats and other pests carried viral loads into different apartments.

Given that the standard housing situation in China are multifamily apartments, this means that people cannot avoid getting the virus simply by staying home and not seeing anyone else. All building sewage systems must regularly be tested. All toilets and drains must be kept in working order, not clogged, and U-traps, P-traps and other traps must be kept filled with water.

2020-02-02,electi0neering,China_Flu,27,https://www.reddit.com/r/China_Flu/comments/exue5i/coronavirus_looking_like_a_pandemic/fgcqosd/,"The effects of a pandemic would probably be harsher in some countries than in others. While the United States and other wealthy countries may be able to detect and quarantine the first carriers, countries with fragile health care systems will not. The virus has already reached Cambodia, India, Malaysia, Nepal, the Philippines and rural Russia.
“This looks far more like H1N1’s spread than SARS, and I am increasingly alarmed,” said Dr. Peter Piot, director of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine. “Even 1 percent mortality would mean 10,000 deaths in each million people.”
Other experts were more cautious.
Dr. Michael Ryan, head of emergency responses for the World Health Organization, said in an interview with STAT News on Saturday that there was “evidence to suggest this virus can still be contained” and that the world needed to “keep trying.”

Dr. W. Ian Lipkin, a virus-hunter at the Columbia University Mailman School of Public Health who is in China advising its Center for Disease Control and Prevention, said that although the virus is clearly being transmitted through casual contact, labs are still behind in processing samples.

But life in China has radically changed in the last two weeks. Streets are deserted, public events are canceled, and citizens are wearing masks and washing their hands, Dr. Lipkin said. All of that may have slowed down what lab testing indicated was exponential growth in the infection.
It’s unclear exactly how accurate tests done in overwhelmed Chinese laboratories are. On the one hand, Chinese state media have reported test kit shortages and processing bottlenecks, which could produce an undercount.

But Dr. Lipkin said he knew of one lab running 5,000 samples a day, which might produce some false-positive results, inflating the count. “You can’t possibly do quality control at that rate,” he said.
Anecdotal reports from China, and one published study from Germany, indicate that some people infected with the Wuhan coronavirus can pass it on before they show symptoms. That may make border-screening much harder, scientists said.
Epidemiological modeling released Friday by the European Center for Disease Prevention and Control estimated that 75 percent of infected people reaching Europe from China would still be in the incubation periods upon arrival, and therefore not detected by airport screening, which looks for fevers, coughs and breathing difficulties.
But if thermal cameras miss victims who are beyond incubation and actively infecting others, the real number of missed carriers may be higher than 75 percent."

Most people get ill from someone they know to be sick — a family member, a co-worker or a patient, for example.
The virus’s most vulnerable target is Africa, many experts said. More than 1 million expatriate Chinese work there, mostly on mining, drilling or engineering projects. Also, many Africans work and study in China and other countries where the virus has been found.
If anyone on the continent has the virus now, “I’m not sure the diagnostic systems are in place to detect it,” said Dr. Daniel Bausch, head of scientific programs for the American Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene, who is consulting with the W.H.O. on the outbreak.
South Africa and Senegal could probably diagnose it, he said. Nigeria and some other countries have asked the W.H.O. for the genetic materials and training they need to perform diagnostic tests, but that will take time.


At least four African countries have suspect cases quarantined, according to an article published Friday in The South China Morning Post. They have sent samples to France, Germany, India and South Africa for testing.
[Like the Science Times page on Facebook. | Sign up for the Science Times newsletter.]
At the moment, it seems unlikely that the virus will spread widely in countries with vigorous, alert public health systems, said Dr. William Schaffner, a preventive medicine specialist at Vanderbilt University Medical Center.
“Every doctor in the U.S. has this top of mind,” he said. “Any patient with fever or respiratory problems will get two questions. ‘Have you been to China? Have you had contact with anyone who has?’ If the answer is yes, they’ll be put in isolation right away.”
Assuming the virus spreads globally, tourism to and trade with countries besides China may be affected — and the urgency to find ways to halt the virus and prevent deaths will grow.


It is possible that the Wuhan coronavirus will fade out as weather warms. Many viruses, like flu, measles and norovirus, thrive in cold, dry air. The SARS outbreak began in winter, and MERS transmission also peaks then, though that may be related to transmission in newborn camels.
Four mild coronaviruses cause about a quarter of the nation’s common colds, which also peak in winter.
But even if an outbreak fades in June, there could be a second wave in the fall, as has occurred in every major flu pandemic, including those that began in 1918 and 2009.


By that time, some remedies might be on hand, although they will need rigorous testing and perhaps political pressure to make them available and affordable.
In China, several antiviral drugs are being prescribed. A common combination is pills containing lopinavir and ritonavir with infusions of interferon, a signaling protein that wakes up the immune system.
In the United States, the combination is sold as Kaletra by AbbVie for H.I.V. therapy, and it is relatively expensive. In India, a dozen generic makers produce the drugs at rock-bottom prices for use against H.I.V. in Africa, and their products are W.H.O.-approved.
Another option may be an experimental drug, remdesivir, on which the patent is held by Gilead. The drug has not yet been approved for use against any disease. Nonetheless, there is some evidence that it works against coronaviruses, and Gilead has donated doses to China.


Several American companies are working on a vaccine, using various combinations of their own funds, taxpayer money and foundation grants.
Although modern gene-chemistry techniques have made it possible to build vaccine candidates within just days, medical ethics require that they then be carefully tested on animals and small numbers of healthy humans for safety and effectiveness.
That aspect of the process cannot be sped up, because dangerous side effects may take time to appear and because human immune systems need time to produce the antibodies that show whether a vaccine is working.
Whether or not what is being tried in China will be acceptable elsewhere will depend on how rigorously Chinese doctors run their clinical trials.
“In God we trust,” Dr. Schaffner said. “All others must provide data.”"

First of all, that study is investigating receptor proteins, not proteases, the targets of the HIV drugs called out in this post.

Second the HIV proteins they used in the study you referenced were not recombined in coronaviruses. I got this last bit wrong in my initial draft: They essentially attached a piece of the SARS virus onto a special neutered form of HIV used in lab assays. With only this one bit in play, they further assure that when the virus binds to the target, it was only the piece they added that did.  They were only testing how well the SARS protein bound to ACE2 receptors across different mammal species.   They were not 'modifying SARS with HIV'.

Third, even if that were the case, 2019-nCoV's 3CL-like protease, encoded by gene nsp5, [is not related to HIV, but directly to SARS itself](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/22221751.2020.1719902), as we would other otherwise expect.  This protease is what the HIV drugs in this post (protease inhibitors) work against. From the paper I linked above:

>There are no remarkable differences between the orfs and nsps of 2019-nCoV with those of SARS-CoV

The fact that 'anti-HIV' viral protease inhibitor drugs might be showing efficacy against 2019-nCoV (I'll further point out this research is preliminary) has literally nothing to do with HIV or 'engineering', but is instead because proteases of this type, which are important to the replication phases of many different viruses, show enough natural similarity to each other to be vulnerable to a drug that targets them as a class.  We know what the gene sequences are here, and they have not significantly changed. They are just as similar to other wild strains of coronavirus as one would expect.

Edit: pointing out that nothing is conclusive

Edit 2: Fixing my own misunderstanding of the paper. There's even less going on than I initially thought."

^_    
I am seeing today more and more experts saying that this could be a global pandemic.  Today is the first day that I believe it may spread a lot in the US - before I felt like we just didn't know.    With so many people flying in from China to the US in the last two weeks, I can believe it will spread in the US.  I also feel like some Asian countries like Thailand are going to be hit big with this virus.   

I went today from thinking it probably won't come to the US to thinking it will.

That means the coronavirus would have to express the same enzyme, neuraminidase, as influenza. 

Just some information here:

Neuraminidase is an enzyme that promotes viral release of influenza from the cell

Ritonavir and lopinavir are protease inhibitors, which are responsible for the cutting of larger proteins into the smaller ones that eventually become a mature HIV virus. 

This is big news if it is factual because that means we will have a greater understanding of either how this virus is assembled in the cell, or how it is released, or both."

In order for them to work, you have to be very disciplined -- can't get them wet, don't remove them to talk/itch. Replace every few wearings. Most people can't do this. Experts think that for laypeople not in a disease-heavy area, masks are not very helpful. Wash your hands and don't touch your face instead.

Second, the chance of you encountering someone with the virus is extremely low. Even if there were a few dozen cases, you almost certainly would not run into them.

But buying masks means that there will be a shortage of masks in hospitals, where doctors and nurses need them most.

https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/23/health/coronavirus-surgical-masks.html

> But there isn’t much high-quality scientific evidence on their effectiveness outside health care settings, experts say. Most of the best studies, which are randomized controlled trials, focused on how well surgical masks protect health care workers in hospitals from picking up infections from sick patients, and found that consistent use of them helped.

> Dr. Julie Vaishampayan, chairwoman of the public health committee for the Infectious Diseases Society of America, said surgical masks are really “the last line of defense.”

> “We worry about people feeling they’re getting more protection from the mask than they really are,” she said. “Washing your hands and avoiding people who are ill is way more important than wearing a mask.”

> I’ve worked as an emergency room physician. And as a New York Times correspondent in China, I covered the SARS outbreak in 2002 and 2003 during which a novel coronavirus first detected in Guangdong sickened more than 8,000 people and killed more than 800. My two children attended elementary school in Beijing throughout the outbreak.
> 
> Here are my main takeaways from that experience for ordinary people on the ground:

> 1. Wash your hands frequently.

> 2. Don’t go to the office when you are sick. Don’t send your kids to school or day care when they are ill, either.

> Notice I didn’t say anything about masks. Having a mask with you as a precaution makes sense if you are in the midst of an outbreak, as I was when out reporting in the field during those months. But wearing it constantly is another matter. I donned a mask when visiting hospitals where SARS patients had been housed. I wore it in the markets where wild animals that were the suspected source of the outbreak were being butchered, blood droplets flying. I wore it in crowded enclosed spaces that I couldn’t avoid, like airplanes and trains, as I traveled to cities involved in the outbreak, like Guangzhou and Hong Kong. You never know if the guy coughing and sneezing two rows ahead of you is ill or just has an allergy.

> But outdoors, infections don’t spread well through the air. Those photos of people walking down streets in China wearing masks are dramatic but uninformed. And remember if a mask has, perchance, intercepted viruses that would have otherwise ended up in your body, then the mask is contaminated. So, in theory, to be protected maybe you should use a new one for each outing."

He had a higher DENSITY of ACE2 receptors in the AT2 alveolar cells. So basically, he had more ACE2 receptors in his lungs. Given the sample size it’s a bit hard to extrapolate this to the entire Asian population.
Alveolar AT2 cell ACE2 receptors are not (as far as I know) a target of ACE inhibitors (which can cause ACE2 receptor up regulation in renal cells).

This is quite different than saying Asian patients have a higher binding affinity of their ACE2 receptors to this particular coronavirus. The study you quote talks about one particular ACE polymorphism (ACE II, or insertion/insertion) but there are many potential differences (259 polymorphisms or more), and in the coronavirus case it’s variations in ACE2 receptors in the AT2 alveolar cells that seem most relevant.  I think you might be confused between the ACE I/I genotype (written ACEII) and ACE2. This isn’t my area of expertise, so perhaps an expert would like to comment further on this?"

Similar to SARS, 2019-nCov targets the ACE2 protein in lung cells. This protein is predominantly found in Asian males. 

2.5% of Asian donor cells express ACE2 and only .47% of black and white donor cells. The virus needs ACE2 to inject RNA. Thus the more ACE2 expressed in cells the more easily the virus is transmitted and the higher the morbidity rate.

This can be seen by the virus mostly infecting and killing males (3:1 ratio of infection) and having difficulty spreading outside of Asia.

It's also flu season, and as far as I'm aware there are no official treatments for coronavirus other than symptom management. So, in a way, other than scaling outbreaks, official numbers may not be very helpful as far as treating people goes.
+ The symptoms are similar to flu, and it is possible to have both flu and coronavirus at the same time. Potential cases could test positive for the flu, and if there's no other testing left at that. 

Or cases are not popping up worldwide. 

OR this means coronavirus is much milder than originally thought in the majority of people.

Yeah, I have a lot of sources.

I've been reading this in Chinese sites, Chinese forums and even in the mainstream, I will link some of them talking about it.

I will show source from China (from the official site of the gov of Wuhan), I know they aren't that trustworthy, since China is famous for censoring and manipulating information, but it is the most ""official"" thing we have to work with. Use google translator to help you.

 [http://wjw.wuhan.gov.cn/front/web/showDetail/2020012309114](http://wjw.wuhan.gov.cn/front/web/showDetail/2020012309114) 

""  为适应当前防控形势需要，提高检测速度，经请示上级有关部门同意，从1月22日昨天开始，我市已指定各定点救治医院、发热定点诊疗医院的对口帮扶医院以及市疾控中心等具备相应防护级别的生物安全实验室开展相关样本的病原核酸检测工作（第一批共10家机构），预计全部运行起来每天可检测样本近2000份。为此，我市计划紧急调运3万人份试剂盒发放到指定检测机构，目前已下发6000人份。 "" - Use Ctrl F to find this part, and then translate.

It basically says they can only test 2000 people per day at max capacity (what is not always the case) and that they plan get 30,000 test kits extras (probably to test all the suspect cases pilling up), but that they have already ordered 6000 copies of test kits (that are developed daily and sent as soon as possible, that's why they can test a little bit more than 2000 people in Wuhan, maybe they can test 2500-3000).

There are other companies developing test kits, but I can't tell you if China is already using them to confirm cases or just to get suspected cases, since they didn't inform us.

But you can use the numbers officially posted to confirm that.

There are more than 20,000 suspected cases, even confirming 2000 cases daily, the number of suspect cases keep growing. If they could test all of them, the number of suspected cases would drop to 0 everyday since they could test them all.

Also, the numbers of daily confirmed infected people and suspected people were increasing everyday but suddenly the rate of confirmed cases stuck in around 2000 confirmed cases daily, while the rate of daily suspected cases keep increasing. What would suddenly stick the confirmed cases at 2000 if anything different happen? The amount of tests they can do daily.

If they can't test 5000 people on a single day, so the number of confirmed cases daily will never be 5000, even if that same amount of people (5000) were infected.

Also not 100% of people they test give a positive result, so that make the number of confirmed cases float.

Some infected people need multiple tests to get a positive result, even if they have symptoms. A man in Shangai needed 4 tests (in four different days) to get a positive result, the first 3 ones were negative.

(I can edit the comment and link the source if you want to see, it's in Chinese and I'm not that good searching in Chinese, but I can check my history and give you the source).

But anyway, having confirmed cases stuck in \~2000 when the government admits there is a shortage of test kits is kind of self explanatory. That behavior isn't common in any kind of disease, you can check graphs of other diseases, unless they created a vaccine, what isn't the case of coronavirus or in diseases that are under control, isolated."

Flu is worldwide already so more people are exposed to it than this coronavirus so far, and a well known disease. Those statistics are also covering a whole year.

With this coronavirus we are only seeing statistics for the short time it has existed, and it has only begun to spread. Right now we don’t know the death rate (although certainly significantly higher than flu), we don’t know how infectious it is, and we don’t have any vaccines for it. 

You also don’t see hospitals running out of supplies and beds for flu outbreaks. 

The flu may kill more people in an average year so far, but keep in mind that this disease has only just emerged. It is not a good comparison to look at the flu which is a well established and common disease. As it spreads, and if the spread of the virus can not be contained, it has the potential to kill many more people than the flu, and severely sicken many more including young healthy people."

There's no apparent lack of test kits in China, according to BGI which manufactures them:

https://www.genengnews.com/news/detecting-coronavirus-cases-as-outbreak-grows/

> ""BGI has now released a total of 40,000 test kits to hospitals and disease control centers around China. They noted that **they can produce about 50,000 kits a day and have about 100,000 in stock**.""

The daily production capacity of test kits is more than 20 times that of new cases reported. So I don't think there's any testing shortage. Does anyone have any reliable reports about test kit shortage?

So assuming these numbers are genuine and looking at today's numbers: **rate of increase of new infections is significantly down:** yesterday there were 1,921 new cases - so the rate of growth is down from +40% earlier this week to +20% yesterday and **+9% today**.

I.e. the outbreak is not exponential anymore.

If these numbers are accurate then I'd expect the coronavirus epidemic to peak in Hubei province in the next 3 days. The other provinces are still an open question."

NY Times cites the NEJM for the fatality rate at less than 3%. This number is subjected to change drastically up or down, as we are still in the early phases of the outbreak and its hard to know if we can trust China's numbers (lack of honesty or lack of ability to accurately test, dealers choice):
https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/world/asia/china-coronavirus-contain.html 

WHO cites the yearly worldwide death toll of the flu at 300,000-650,000 out of 3 mil - 5 mil infections. Using the ""worst"" numbers, that only results in .2% fatalities. :
https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/influenza-(seasonal)

If this 2019-nCov reaches the same number of people as the flu, we can expect about 5 million deaths and 30 million infections.  As I said, that depends on how well it can be contained.

This isn't the flu we're dealing with -- yeah, people die from the flu every year and it sucks and more people should pay attention and get vaccinated, but coronavirus is being treated as a pandemic precisely because of how different is is from the flu (hence the term **novel**). The regular flu kills a lot of people in China each year, too, but you don't see them ever freak out about it. For this one, they're quarantining whole cities.     
   
2019-nCov is spreading quickly, certainly more quickly than the official statistics indicate (refer to reports in The Lancet, or just consider how borders are being closed), and likely even by asymptomatic individuals. While the foremost difference appears to be the ability to shield against it (""the flu's going around and I have an underlying condition so I ought to vaccinate"" vs. ""nCov is going around and I have an underlying condition and there's been a run on medical supplies, fuck""), talking about people dying from the flu in the US doesn't really have much bearing on a discussion of a novel virus spreading in a society where the flow of information is closely regulated and transparency is regarded, officially, as anathema.    
   
Don't get me wrong -- I don't think there's a chance in hell that I could get devastatingly sick or die, but I do harbor concerns about other things like local people overreacting and hoarding foods and supplies, prolonged business closures, prolonged transportation closures, local people going into panic mode and being exceedingly unpleasant to be around, local officials overreacting and instituting increasingly draconian restrictions, and so on."

When the illness first struck, during the earliest says a doctor sent out a warning to his colleagues. **He was silenced by CCP officials.**

I refer to this NY Times article published today: [https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/01/world/asia/china-coronavirus.html](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/01/world/asia/china-coronavirus.html)

I quote from the article:

>In the middle of the night, officials from the health authority in the central city of Wuhan summoned Dr. Li, demanding to know why he had [shared the information](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/27/technology/china-coronavirus-censorship-social-media.html). Three days later, the police compelled him to sign a statement that his warning constituted “illegal behavior.”

The above happened. It did not have to happen. In a free society that is not held down by the abuses of an authoritarian party doctors are never silenced for warning about a new illness.

>Stop spreading misinformation.

2020-02-02,heilich,China_Flu,8,https://www.reddit.com/r/China_Flu/comments/exsa5d/how_serious_is_this_really/fgbx7ha/,"Let's take a look at the current numbers: 

#Cases

[As of Feb 2, 2020] (https://gisanddata.maps.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html#/bda7594740fd40299423467b48e9ecf6) we have total 14637 confirmed cases:

* 305 deaths
* 443 recovered
* 13889 unresolved 

From this we can calculate, that *out of the resolved cases*:

    (305 deaths) / (748 total resolved) = 41% died and 59% recovered

We have to keep in mind that it takes longer for person to recover than to die from the illness, and hospitals do tests only for the most severely ill ones, so the above calculation isn't a good representation of the actual chances of dying of this flu.

#World Health Organization

The only number given out by World Health Organization (WHO) so far has been a case fatality rate (CFR), which is the number of deaths divided by total confirmed cases. 

    (305 deaths) / (14637 confirmed cases) = 2% case fatality rate

While this is the correct way to calculate case fatality rate, this number doesn't give accurate estimation of the actual mortality rate of the flu, because it is an ongoing situation where majority of the confirmed cases are still unresolved. We don't have the information of whether the unresolved cases end up recovering or dying.

WHO themselves mentioned in the same [press conference](https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/media-resources/press-briefings#): ""*The only number currently known is how many people have died out of those who have been reported to the WHO...it is therefore very early to make any conclusive statements about what the overall mortality rate will be*"".

#The Lancet Study

https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(20)30211-7/fulltext

A study published in The Lancet tracked 99 confirmed cases from Wuhan Jinyintan Hospital. Death rate in that study was **11%**. We have to keep in mind that people in this study were not young an healthy to begin with.

#Reported Numbers vs Reality

The reported numbers only include those who have been tested positive for the virus. A lot of the actual infections will go undiagnosed because China has reached their maximum capacity to test. Hospitals don't have enough test kits to test everyone. Also, majority of people with symptoms will choose to stay at home instead of going to the overcrowded hospitals where infected are gathered and spreading the virus around.  There have even been cases where people were tested positive for the virus and had no symptoms at all, so we really have no idea of the true number of infected people. However, we can safely assume that total number of infected is much much more than the reported confirmed cases.

There's also the very likely possibility that even the reported numbers are inaccurate, as China's officials could be reporting much lower numbers (of both infected and dead) for various political and economic reasons. 

Even if the true number of deaths would be a lot higher than reported, which is probably is because undiagnosed patients are not included in the statistics of the virus, the actual number of infected could easily be higher than 200 000 which means the mortality rate is still low. It's very unlikely that mortality rate of this illness ends up being higher than **5%**.

Only one resident per household is allowed to go out every two days to buy necessities, and 46 highway toll stations have been closed, authorities announced.

The city had previously closed public places such as cinemas and museums, and suspended public transport.

Ms. An, 67, needed an official diagnosis from a hospital to qualify for treatment, but the one she and her son raced to last week had no space, even to test her. The next hospital they were referred to here in Wuhan, the city of 11 million people at the center of the outbreak, was full, too, they said. They finally got an intravenous drip for Ms. An’s fever, but that was all.
Since then, Ms. An has quarantined herself at home. She and her son eat separately, wear masks at home and are constantly disinfecting their apartment. Ms. An’s health is declining rapidly, and even keeping water down is a struggle.

“I can’t let my mom die at home,” said her son, He Jun. “Every day I want to cry, but when I cry there are no tears. There is no hope.”

As countries race to deal with an outbreak that has begun spreading around the world, inciting panic and disrupting the global economy, the residents of Wuhan are waging a daily battle to survive an illness that has sickened more than 4,100 people and killed 224 in their city alone.


Last month, the government put Wuhan in a virtual lockdown, sealing off the city and banning most public transportation and private cars from its streets in a desperate effort to contain the outbreak. Now, many residents say it is nearly impossible to get the health care they need to treat — or even diagnose — the coronavirus.
Expressing exasperation, doctors say there is a shortage of testing kits and other medical supplies, and it is not clear why more are not available. The ban on transportation means some residents have to walk for hours to get to hospitals — if they are well enough to make the journey. Layers of bureaucracy stand between residents and help. And the long lines outside hospitals for testing and treatment suggest that the outbreak is spreading far beyond the official count of cases.

Ambulances, too, are hard to come by, residents say. In recent days, some say they have called 120, China’s equivalent of the emergency number 911, only to be told that there were already hundreds of people in the queue.

Those who do make it to the hospital say they are squeezed together for hours in waiting rooms, where infections are easily spread. But the shortages have meant that many are ultimately turned away and sent home to self-quarantine, potentially compounding the outbreak by exposing their families.

Many doctors and residents are putting their hopes on the two new coronavirus hospitals that China has been racing to build in Wuhan in just a matter of days. One of them spans about eight acres, has 1,000 beds and is scheduled to open on Monday. The government says 1,400 military medical workers will be deployed to work there, potentially helping with the shortage of health professionals on hand to combat the outbreak.

On Sunday, city officials announced plans to set up quarantine stations around Wuhan for people with symptoms of pneumonia and close contacts among coronavirus patients. But just over a week into the lockdown, many residents believe the virus has already spread much further than the official numbers suggest.

“The situation that we’ve seen is much worse than what has been officially reported,” Long Jian, 32, said outside a hospital where his elderly father was being treated. Mr. Long said his father had to go to six hospitals and wait seven days before he could even be tested for the coronavirus.
Just steps from where Mr. Long spoke, beds could be seen lining both sides of a narrow corridor in the emergency room. One man was getting an intravenous drip outside in his car.

“Those who can get diagnosed and treated are the lucky ones,” Mr. Long said. “In our neighborhood, many who weren’t able to get diagnosed ended up dying at home.”
Getting treatment for the coronavirus in a hospital requires jumping through a number of hoops.
According to official guidelines, patients are encouraged to go to their local hospitals first for initial assessments and sometimes prescriptions. Then patients are to deliver the results to their local neighborhood committees, which are responsible for communicating with the hospitals and coordinating resources for the households in their areas. There are about 1,000 neighborhood committees in Wuhan, for a population of 11 million.
Patients with mild symptoms are typically told to go home and self-quarantine, according to a Jan. 24 notice by city officials. Those who have more severe symptoms are flagged by the neighborhood committees, which arrange for transportation by ambulance to one of the two dozen or so hospitals designated for treating the coronavirus.
But in practice, patients and their relatives say that the process takes far too long, and that the bar for what constitutes “severe symptoms” has been set too high — so they give up and try waiting in long lines at hospitals instead.

Amy Hu said her 64-year-old mother went to the doctor after experiencing a fever, cough, shortness of breath and diarrhea about 10 days ago. Based on the initial assessment, the doctor told Ms. Hu’s mother that she had contracted the coronavirus. But the test needed to confirm the diagnosis was not available, the doctor said.

Without the test, her mother couldn’t be admitted to a hospital. Since then, Ms. Hu said, they have been waiting at home to hear back from the hospital about when her mother can be tested. In recent days Ms. Hu, who has been visiting her parents for the Lunar New Year holiday, took precautions herself: She checked into a hostel with her two children.

“I’m very dissatisfied with the government,” Ms. Hu said. “It’s like only when the patients are close to death can they be admitted to a hospital.”


Tong Yixuan, 31, said Sunday that he panicked last week when he learned that in just a few days, his father’s cold had escalated into a full-blown illness that doctors said was almost certainly the coronavirus.
But neither his father, who had a 104-degree fever and was slipping in and out of consciousness, nor his mother, who was starting to show similar symptoms, could get tested. Hospitals said that there was no space, and that their symptoms were not severe enough, Mr. Tong said. His parents were sent home to quarantine themselves.
There was no way for Mr. Tong to help. He was more than 60 miles away in Huangshi, which days ago had been locked down by the government along with many other cities in Hubei Province. The roads out of Huangshi and into Wuhan had all been sealed off. For days, Mr. Tong was stuck. Only Saturday, after hours of negotiation with local officials, was he able to make it to his parents’ bedside, he said. They have since been tested for the coronavirus, and his father has been admitted to a hospital. The process took 10 days.
“All I want to do is take care of my parents,” Mr. Tong said. “I don’t even care if I get infected.”

For some people, like Gan Hanjiang, the new hospitals cannot be built fast enough.
Last month, his father came down with a severe fever and cough. He was tested for the coronavirus, but the results were negative. Ten days after the onset of symptoms, however, his father died, Mr. Gan said.

The hospital classified the cause as “severe pneumonia,” Mr. Gan said, but he believes it was the coronavirus. Several experts have recently conceded that several rounds of testing may be needed for an accurate diagnosis of the virus.
On the day his father died, Mr. Gan began to show the same symptoms, he said. But without a car, he has not been able to go to one of the designated hospitals to get tested for the coronavirus.
“Getting treatment is so difficult,” he whispered slowly by telephone from a small hospital near his home where he was being treated for viral pneumonia. “We can’t get admitted to the hospitals. And there’s not enough medicine.”"

credit goes to u/ScaryChange for the explanation below:

TLDR:

In short, this combination of drugs act inside and outside the infected cells. One inhibits the virus from assembling itself inside the cell, and the other works outside the cell to inhibit newly formed viruses from breaking free and spreading.

\~

HIV drugs, like **lopinavir** (ritonavir is mixed in to delay the breakdown of lopinavir in the body so that it has time to make its way to the infected cells), binds to certain protease enzymes that are typically encoded in viral genetic material. These proteases are required to ""chop"" up the long virus proteins that are generated when they hijack a cell's machinery to make copies of themselves. These chopped up protein segments are assembled to create copies of the virus.

The HIV drug binds to the protease enzyme to inhibit its function, which subsequently inhibits the virus's ability to assemble copies of itself.

I recall Chinese scientists were able to determine the 3D structure of the ""3CL protease"" of the 2019-nCoV virus, which may be a target of interest for the use of these retroviral HIV drugs. Because HIV drugs are designed particularly for HIV, I imagine they may not work completely effectively for this coronavirus strain, but with further research on the structure of this virus's protease enzyme, modifications to this drug may improve its binding affinity with the enzyme's active site to improve inhibition.

I went into a bit more detail in the way that these proteases typically work in an earlier comment I made last week, for anyone who is interested.

[https://np.reddit.com/r/China\_Flu/comments/euflx1/chinese\_scientists\_established\_crystal\_structure/ffp1qyo/](https://np.reddit.com/r/China_Flu/comments/euflx1/chinese_scientists_established_crystal_structure/ffp1qyo/)

\~

Influenza drugs, like **oseltamivir**, act as ""competitive inhibitors"" that target viral neuraminidase (also called sialidase) enzymes.

In order to enter a new cell, the influenza virus must use a glycoprotein (sugar linked to protein) on the surface of the virus's membrane, called hemagglutinin (HA) to recognize and bind to sialic acid residues on the cell surface to initiate the internalization process. When viruses like influenza are finished assembling themselves, they are ready to exit their host cell and spread to infect new hosts. The budding/exiting process creates a growing bubble on the cell's membrane surface, and the resulting curvature of the budding membrane sometimes orients the HA in such a way that it binds with nearby sialic acid residues that protrude outwards, which anchors the virus to the cell ([visual](https://i.imgur.com/D26LbEE.png)). The virus overcomes this anchoring problem with neuraminidase enzymes (also found on the virus's outer membrane surface), which cleave the sialic acid residues from any bound HA to free the virus (along with other proteins that facilitate in freeing the rest of the virus).

Oseltamivir is a competitive inhibitor, which means that it ""competes"" with the sialic acid residues in being acted on by neuraminidase. If you flood the environment with lots of oseltamivir, then neuraminidase will bind with it more frequently than the sialic acid residues, and subsequently *slow down* (but not completely block) the number of viruses that can escape from their old, infected hosts, which ultimately slows the spread of the virus to other cells.

Although 2019-nCoV is NOT and influenza virus, but a coronavirus strain, it contains [hemagglutinin-esterase](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haemagglutinin-esterase_fusion_glycoprotein) proteins on its surface, which unlike Influenza A and B's HA that binds sialic acid, binds 9-O-acetyl**sialic acid** instead. I assume that the similarities between these two receptor molecules are what lead doctors to use this influenza drug, in hopes that it also inhibits coronavirus HA-esterase to some degree."

Wash your hands regularly throughout the day, use hand sanitizer as needed, clean off things like shopping cart handles and door handles if possible, avoid contact with people who have symptoms/fever, and don't go out if you have symptoms/fever. 
The problem with this novel coronavirus is that is a brand new virus, we have no herd immunity. We don't have a clear understanding of how many people are infected, the rate of spread, the time it lives on surfaces, and how/ where it began. China has quarantined millions of people, is building new hospitals in a matter of weeks, and now is mandating cremation. In my lifetime, I have never seen these sort of extreme reactions to an illness that is less dangerous than the flu."

The core problems with suggesting this is just the flu is OMG that's a big quarantine and OMG that's a coronavirus that humans probably cannot develop any lasting immunity to. It's not the flu, it's like if the flu had another whole different virus and significant worse virus buddy and they hung out together killing humans that much faster. 

The reason to panic is to attempt to eradicate the virus BEFORE it becomes the next flu level threat in X years of establishing itself and mutating in favor of human host infections. We still have a good chance it will mutate in our favor and dead end itself and that quarantine efforts keep total infections low enough though rapidly rising infection numbers and China running out of medical supplies are not pushing me in the direction of that being likely. 

The BIG threat is not simply one or two big outbreaks, it's that this becomes a reoccuring fixture of humanity... like the flu but with the immunity resistance of the common cold. That's an above average threat if you considering a likely enough scenario of this virus eventually infecting millions of people. There is also a question of how fast people recover and how long they stay contagious because so far I'm not seeing enough information about ages of infections and recoveries. 

When talking to people who want to write it off, it's ok to say WELL we probably won't have a bad outbreak.. this year, but the bigger threat here is that a virus like this becomes a seasonal threat."

A video posted by Beijing News on Sunday appeared to show government workers taking some of those donated supplies. A statement from the Wuhan government said that personnel attending a meeting on emergency supplies on Saturday had “received masks and other related protective supplies” from China’s Red Cross, which is overseeing donations.

“We will further standardise the collection, storage, and distribution of protective gear for frontline workers … Thank you to the media for their attention and supervision,” the statement said, according to images of it posted by Beijing News.
Other photos showed officials wearing specialised N95 respirator masks in a meeting with doctors who wore surgical masks.

Online commentators were quick to criticise the statement and footage, generating more than 2m views for comments with the hashtag “Wuhan government responds to taking personnel face masks”.

One user wrote: “These supplies are for the doctors, not the government.” Another said: “They are still using this completely insincere bureaucratic way of talking to the people? Disappointed.” Another: “Shameless … Have some dignity. The whole country is watching.”

Others pointed out the privileges of officials over the general public. Across China, people have struggled to buy masks and other protective equipment. A Weibo user posted under the video: “If you can’t buy masks, where do you think ordinary citizens go to buy them?”

The prospect is daunting. A pandemic — an ongoing epidemic on two or more continents — may well have global consequences, despite the extraordinary travel restrictions and quarantines now imposed by China and other countries, including the United States.

Scientists do not yet know how lethal the new coronavirus is, however, so there is uncertainty about how much damage a pandemic might cause. But there is growing consensus that the pathogen is readily transmitted between humans.

The Wuhan coronavirus is spreading more like influenza, which is highly transmissible, than like its slow-moving viral cousins, SARS and MERS, scientists have found.

“It’s very, very transmissible, and it almost certainly is going to be a pandemic,” said Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease.

“But will it be catastrophic? I don’t know.”

In the last three weeks, the number of lab-confirmed cases has soared from about 50 in China to 14,000 in 23 countries; there have been over 300 deaths, all but one in China.

But various epidemiological models estimate that the real number of cases is 100,000 or even more. While that expansion is not as rapid as that of flu or measles, it is an enormous leap beyond what virologists saw when SARS and MERS emerged.

When SARS was vanquished in July 2003 after spreading for nine months, only 8,098 cases had been confirmed. MERS has been circulating since 2012, but there have been only about 2,500 known cases.

How Bad Will the Coronavirus Outbreak Get? Here Are 6 Key Factors
Here’s what early research says about how the pathogen behaves and the factors that will determine whether it can be contained.
Jan. 31, 2020

The biggest uncertainty now, experts said, is how many people around the world will die. SARS killed about 10 percent of those who got it, and MERS now kills about one of three.

The 1918 “Spanish flu” killed only about 2.5 percent of its victims — but because it infected so many people and medical care was much cruder then, 20 to 50 million died.

By contrast, the highly transmissible H1N1 “swine flu” pandemic of 2009 killed about 285,000, fewer than seasonal flu normally does, and had a relatively low fatality rate, estimated at .02 percent.

The mortality rate for known cases of the Wuhan coronavirus has been running about 2 percent, although that is likely to drop as more tests are done and more mild cases are found.

It is “increasingly unlikely that the virus can be contained,” said Dr. Thomas R. Frieden, a former director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention who now runs Resolve to Save Lives, a nonprofit devoted to fighting epidemics.

“It is therefore likely that it will spread, as flu and other organisms do, but we still don’t know how far, wide or deadly it will be.”

In the early days of the 2009 flu pandemic, “they were talking about Armageddon in Mexico,” Dr. Fauci said. (That virus first emerged in pig-farming areas in Mexico’s Veracruz State.) “But it turned out to not be that severe.”

An accurate estimate of the virus’s lethality will not be possible until certain kinds of studies can be done: blood tests to see how many people have antibodies, household studies to learn how often it infects family members, and genetic sequencing to determine whether some strains are more dangerous than others.

Closing borders to highly infectious pathogens never succeeds completely, experts said, because all frontiers are somewhat porous. Nonetheless, closings and rigorous screening may slow the spread, which will buy time for the development of drug treatments and vaccines.

Other important unknowns include who is most at risk, whether coughing or contaminated surfaces are more likely to transmit the virus, how fast the virus can mutate and whether it will fade out when the weather warms.


Coronavirus Map: Tracking the Spread of the Outbreak
The virus has sickened more than 14,600 people in China and 23 other countries.

The effects of a pandemic would probably be harsher in some countries than in others. While the United States and other wealthy countries may be able to detect and quarantine the first carriers, countries with fragile health care systems will not. The virus has already reached Cambodia, India, Malaysia, Nepal, the Philippines and rural Russia.

“This looks far more like H1N1’s spread than SARS, and I am increasingly alarmed,” said Dr. Peter Piot, director of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine. “Even 1 percent mortality would mean 10,000 deaths in each million people.”

Other experts were more cautious.

Dr. Michael Ryan, head of emergency responses for the World Health Organization, said in an interview with STAT News on Saturday that there was “evidence to suggest this virus can still be contained” and that the world needed to “keep trying.”

Dr. W. Ian Lipkin, a virus-hunter at the Columbia University Mailman School of Public Health who is in China advising its Center for Disease Control and Prevention, said that although the virus is clearly being transmitted through casual contact, labs are still behind in processing samples.

But life in China has radically changed in the last two weeks. Streets are deserted, public events are canceled, and citizens are wearing masks and washing their hands, Dr. Lipkin said. All of that may have slowed down what lab testing indicated was exponential growth in the infection.

It’s unclear exactly how accurate tests done in overwhelmed Chinese laboratories are. On the one hand, Chinese state media have reported test kit shortages and processing bottlenecks, which could produce an undercount.

But Dr. Lipkin said he knew of one lab running 5,000 samples a day, which might produce some false-positive results, inflating the count. “You can’t possibly do quality control at that rate,” he said.

Anecdotal reports from China, and one published study from Germany, indicate that some people infected with the Wuhan coronavirus can pass it on before they show symptoms. That may make border-screening much harder, scientists said.

Epidemiological modeling released Friday by the European Center for Disease Prevention and Control estimated that 75 percent of infected people reaching Europe from China would still be in the incubation periods upon arrival, and therefore not detected by airport screening, which looks for fevers, coughs and breathing difficulties.

But if thermal cameras miss victims who are beyond incubation and actively infecting others, the real number of missed carriers may be higher than 75 percent.

Still, asymptomatic carriers “are not normally major drivers of epidemics,” Dr. Fauci said. Most people get ill from someone they know to be sick — a family member, a co-worker or a patient, for example.

The virus’s most vulnerable target is Africa, many experts said. More than 1 million expatriate Chinese work there, mostly on mining, drilling or engineering projects. Also, many Africans work and study in China and other countries where the virus has been found.

If anyone on the continent has the virus now, “I’m not sure the diagnostic systems are in place to detect it,” said Dr. Daniel Bausch, head of scientific programs for the American Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene, who is consulting with the W.H.O. on the outbreak.

South Africa and Senegal could probably diagnose it, he said. Nigeria and some other countries have asked the W.H.O. for the genetic materials and training they need to perform diagnostic tests, but that will take time.

At least four African countries have suspect cases quarantined, according to an article published Friday in The South China Morning Post. They have sent samples to France, Germany, India and South Africa for testing.

At the moment, it seems unlikely that the virus will spread widely in countries with vigorous, alert public health systems, said Dr. William Schaffner, a preventive medicine specialist at Vanderbilt University Medical Center.

“Every doctor in the U.S. has this top of mind,” he said. “Any patient with fever or respiratory problems will get two questions. ‘Have you been to China? Have you had contact with anyone who has?’ If the answer is yes, they’ll be put in isolation right away.”

Assuming the virus spreads globally, tourism to and trade with countries besides China may be affected — and the urgency to find ways to halt the virus and prevent deaths will grow.

It is possible that the Wuhan coronavirus will fade out as weather warms. Many viruses, like flu, measles and norovirus, thrive in cold, dry air. The SARS outbreak began in winter, and MERS transmission also peaks then, though that may be related to transmission in newborn camels.

Four mild coronaviruses cause about a quarter of the nation’s common colds, which also peak in winter.

But even if an outbreak fades in June, there could be a second wave in the fall, as has occurred in every major flu pandemic, including those that began in 1918 and 2009."

It won't, sadly it's too late and it will be bad everywhere:

> Of course, deaths are not the only impactful metric by far - there would be far more seriously ill people than those who die. In addition to the many millions who would die, many more would become severely ill and need hospital care. How many? Right now the WHO estimates 20%. https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.nytimes.com/article/what-is-coronavirus.amp.html Some of them will be critically ill with Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome and multiple organ failure (common complications of this virus), requiring ICU level care with full ventilation. There are only a hundred thousand or so ICU beds in the entire United States, a highly developed first world country. Even if only a small percentage of the 7.2 million severely ill people in America need ICU treatment to survive (assuming the lower 11% infection figure), you’re easily exceeding the entire country’s ICU capacity many times over. And, of course, ICU beds don’t just sit around empty all the time when there is no pandemic around, and people don’t stop needing the ICU for other non-pandemic things just because a pandemic is happening. The same applies to regularly staffed hospital beds, of which America only has roughly a million of. To treat 7.2 million severely ill people. On the low end. Now imagine you live in West Africa or a poorer district of India - how do you think the hospital situation there would fare with such influx?
> 
> So you can see why a pandemic coronavirus is likely not on the same level as the common flu or heart disease or whatever random common thing people online are comparing it to. If it happens, it will be a highly memorable world event, killing perhaps a fourth to a half as many people who died in World War 2 - assuming no more than 20% of people in the world catch it, and assuming health care can keep up so that otherwise manageable cases aren’t triaged or just neglected into a fatality, which might be asking a lot. In a “really bad” scenario, 100 million plus deaths across the globe is probably not out of the question. At some point it gets bad enough that you have to start taking into account the effect of collapsed supply chains, production shortages, and breakdowns in civil order. Which is way beyond back of the envelope.

The clip resurfaced on social media after cases of the new coronavirus emerged in Wuhan late last year.
Following online backlash, Ms Wang apologised, saying she was ""just trying to introduce the life of local people"" to the audience and had not known that bats could be a virus carrier. Her video has since been taken down.

————-

Chinese leaders at a Chinese Communist Party (CCP) Politburo meeting last week expressed concern that the Wuhan coronavirus outbreak may put an end to their rule. They have decided to focus on preserving 11 major cities from being devastated by the virus.

Stephen Shiu Yeuk-yuen, a senior political commentator and media professional in Hong Kong, told the Hong Kong edition of The Epoch Times on Jan. 28 that he obtained the information from an insider in the CCP’s top leadership. According to Shiu, the Politburo emergency meeting was held on Jan. 25, on the day of the Chinese New Year.

The 11 cities on the CCP’s priority list of being saved are Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Shenzhen, Hong Kong, Hangzhou, Xi’an, Shenyang, Harbin, and Urumqi. The CCP is prepared to protect these 11 cities at all cost, even if it means sacrificing other cities, Shiu said.

————

Projected Death Toll Estimate: Between 1 and 2 Million

Shiu said that according to a recent research report by Professor Gabriel Matthew Leung, before the lockdown of Wuhan—where the deadly and highly contagious coronavirus originated—there were about 25,000 people infected with the coronavirus, and 15,000 additional cases during the virus incubation period. This means, the total number of infected people is roughly 40,000. Based on the spreading pattern, it is estimated that the current number of infected people around the globe is between 25,000 and 38,000.

Prof. Leung is Dean of the University of Hong Kong’s Medical School. He is also a recognized medical doctor and public health authority.

Leung’s report points out that without strong intervention measures in place, the number of infected people will double every 6.2 days, if the calculation is based on an even more conservative figure of 22,000 infected cases globally at present.

Leung estimates that in Wuhan, the number of newly infected patients will reach the maximum—about 200,000 per day—in April. In several other cities, including Chongqing, Guangzhou and Shenzhen, the number will peak in May. In the months that follow, the total number of infected people across the country will reach 18 million, with the total number of deaths ranging between 1 and 2 million.

————-

Information Blockade and Cover-up

Shiu criticized the CCP for its cover-up and delay in taking measures to contain the virus, saying the main reason for this catastrophe is the blocking of information.

As a result, those who were infected with the disease were not quarantined in a timely manner.

Chinese authorities initially denied that the disease could be spread via human-to-human transmission.

In addition, for several days, Chinese medical authorities reported very few new cases in Wuhan and no new cases in other Chinese cities, giving the public a false impression that the novel coronavirus was not a threat to public health.

Then on Jan. 20, a leading scientist of China’s Health Commission, Zhong Nanshan, announced at a press conference in Beijing that the disease can spread from human to human.

Wuhan’s mayor subsequently announced a city-wide lockdown on Jan. 23, and quarantined the city on the same day. But millions of people had already left Wuhan for the holiday before Jan. 20, and nearly 300,000 Wuhan residents rushed to escape from the city before the lockdown was executed.

In addition, even after the city-wide lockdown of Wuhan, the central authorities failed to dispatch needed manpower and medical supplies, resulting in things such as corpses lying about on a hospital floor and citizens not being informed about virus prevention, all of which would further spread the virus.

The 11 Cities

According to Shiu’s insider contact, central authorities at the Jan. 25 Politburo meeting pointed out that the novel coronavirus outbreak poses a serious challenge to the legitimacy of the CCP’s rule. In other words, the CCP is facing a serious crisis and the threat of its total demise.

Shiu said he believes the epidemic, which is now getting out of control, will have “a deadly impact” on China’s economy. In his estimation, more than half of Chinese business activities will come to a halt. Hong Kong will also be affected, he said.


Therefore, the top officials at the political meeting decided to go all out to save the 11 cities from the coronavirus outbreak.

The insider did not give specific reasons as to why the authorities chose those 11 cities, but they are the commercial and military hubs in the country. It is well-known among mainland Chinese that the most developed metros and financial hubs are Beijing, Shanghai, Shenzhen, Guangzhou and Hong Kong; and the military technology centers are Xi’an, Shenyang and Harbin.

Shiu predicted that Shenzhen, a city of about 20 million people that borders Hong Kong, will soon be completely isolated from other Chinese regions.

“There are many high-tech companies in Shenzhen,” he explained. “As for Hong Kong, the city’s government seems to be hesitating. I believe it is because they are waiting for the final instruction from the central government [Beijing],” he said.

Meanwhile, more than 15,000 hospital authority employees in Hong Kong have joined a new union, urging the Hong Kong government to close the border with mainland China. According to the representative of the union, if they do not receive any response from local officials by Feb. 3, members of the union will launch a large-scale strike."

But for me all of those are superseded by the need to get information about the spread of the pathogen and to contain it. It’s the top priority (for me) by magnitudes. 

Let’s assume for a second that all the conspiracy theories are right. The Wuhan Lab made the disease by combining the coronavirus with HIV. They leaked it intentionally and are now trying to cover up. All of that is true. Now what? We stop tracking the disease and arrest the CCP? We fine them? We declare war?

> Of course, deaths are not the only impactful metric by far - there would be far more seriously ill people than those who die. In addition to the many millions who would die, many more would become severely ill and need hospital care. How many? Right now the WHO estimates 20%. https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.nytimes.com/article/what-is-coronavirus.amp.html Some of them will be critically ill with Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome and multiple organ failure (common complications of this virus), requiring ICU level care with full ventilation. There are only a hundred thousand or so ICU beds in the entire United States, a highly developed first world country. Even if only a small percentage of the 7.2 million severely ill people in America need ICU treatment to survive (assuming the lower 11% infection figure), you’re easily exceeding the entire country’s ICU capacity many times over. And, of course, ICU beds don’t just sit around empty all the time when there is no pandemic around, and people don’t stop needing the ICU for other non-pandemic things just because a pandemic is happening. The same applies to regularly staffed hospital beds, of which America only has roughly a million of. To treat 7.2 million severely ill people. On the low end. Now imagine you live in West Africa or a poorer district of India - how do you think the hospital situation there would fare with such influx?
> 
> So you can see why a pandemic coronavirus is likely not on the same level as the common flu or heart disease or whatever random common thing people online are comparing it to. If it happens, it will be a highly memorable world event, killing perhaps a fourth to a half as many people who died in World War 2 - assuming no more than 20% of people in the world catch it, and assuming health care can keep up so that otherwise manageable cases aren’t triaged or just neglected into a fatality, which might be asking a lot. In a “really bad” scenario, 100 million plus deaths across the globe is probably not out of the question. At some point it gets bad enough that you have to start taking into account the effect of collapsed supply chains, production shortages, and breakdowns in civil order. Which is way beyond back of the envelope.

1. The coronavirus will infect 85%+ of the global population exposed to it.
2. The  coronavirus infects the respiratory epithelial tissues, and is readily  spread via airborne water droplets. nCOV can enter through eyes, nose,  mouth, and via fecal matter.
3. The  person with coronavirus will infect, generally speaking, an average of  2-4 other people (Average R0 of approximately 2.5-4.1). We don't know  the exact R0, but we have a general range.
4. There's  a roughly 2-14 day incubation period, and then, approximately another 1  week of illness - that's roughly 3 weeks of infectious. Evidence  suggests that asymptomatic and recovered individuals can still spread  infectious viral particles.
5. \*\*\*The  death rate is roughly 2%-10% of hospitalized individuals (the public  isn't being told, but the military/WHO etc already knows the true  figures).
6. \*\*\*The rate of severe illness requiring hospitalization is on the order of 10-20% of all infected cases.

Fact  A: The fourteen day asymptomatic period, and the post-recovered  infectious period makes it virtually impossible to stop the coronavirus.  This virus has already spread throughout the major cities of the world -  we just haven't begun developing symptoms yet.

Fact  B: Thousands of Chinese continue to flee their cities and the country,  and have been doing so for at least the past 14 days (only on 2/2/2020  have flights to the USA been curtailed somewhat). Popular international  destinations include Thailand, Philippines, India, Bangladesh, United  Arab Emirates, Europe, Canada, and the US.

Fact  C. Global Dimming is the phenomenon of particulate matter, and airplane  contrails reflecting sufficient amounts of sunlight out of the  atmosphere to hide between 1C and 3C of global average temperature rise.  Unfortunately, a substantial fraction of all global dimming on earth  originates from China and India – the two countries most likely to be  heavily impacted by the coronavirus. Studies estimate a roughly 1-3C  rise in global average temperature over an approximately 6 week period.

The coronavirus is a “new normal”. This virus is now a permanent “member” of our global society.

This is the problem

1. people testing negitive and actually being positive and then sent on their way to infect others, how many times has this happend?

2. dying of the virus most likely and it being called Pnuemonia or something else, this makes it very hard to know the actual death count and mortality rate.  

In short, we have no real data to know how deadly this is or how many people are infecting others right now thinking they are clear all over the world."

Surgical masks are usually for spilled fluids and is more effective if it's the wearer who has the sickness (e.g: coughing/cold/flu) but it does not protect a wearer, rather minimizes the spread from the carrier. 

For Coronavirus, the best one is N95, as it really blocks out the air outside and covers your nose and mouth completely. But it is also not as recommended to use because it makes it hard to breathe. If you know someone wearing an N95 the whole day and is fine, they are most likely wearing it wrong. 

As to why everyone still wears it, I believe it's more Psychological. Wearing a mask gives you the impression of a shield against a virus--that's why everyone's panic buying it. 

Tldr: No harm in wearing it, but it's not really effective. The most effective mask for nCov is an N95 mask.

Going forward, I think we may see some improvement, but not a wholesale upgrade.  China lacks political transparency and an independent media.  There is no accountability for incompetence so the food supply will continue to be suspect.  

Interesting side note, my father grew up in the Chinese countryside in the 60s.  He left to study microbiology in college.  When he came back to his village, he tried to convince the villagers to move their farm animals away from living quarters to reduce zoonotic infections.  Most lived near their pigs and chickens in close quarters with the occasional dog to guard them.  The villagers laughed at my dad and thought he’d gotten all this silly city boy nonsense in his head.  Besides, it was too expensive to have a separate barn for animals.  

My dad later told me it was frustrating to try to explain to chinese farmers things like viruses and disease vectors.  When he immigrated to America, he was pleasantly surprised American farmers housed their farm animals in separate buildings."

I’ve done RT-PCR quite a few times, and there’s a significant amount of physical work that goes into prepping samples and analysis after. If it’s qPCR, much less analysis work after. But regardless, each sample can take a couple of hours to prepare, and it’s very likely they need to prepare these samples in at least triplicate. Depending on the type of cell/material required, we might need very specialized reagents.

At my throughput I could probably do two runs of RT-PCR a day, and loading each sample means that I could probably handle at most 90-120 at once (so maybe 30-40 patients at once). Two batches means 60-80 people per day.

I was only able to handle level-2 type diseases, and I would imagine coronavirus is a lot more stringent both in terms of labs, trainings and procedures. So it’s not really unbelievable that throughout could only be 2000/day. I believe many patients are also tested multiple times, too."

Wuhan Coronavirus Looks Increasingly Like a Pandemic, Experts Say

The Wuhan coronavirus spreading from China is now likely to become a pandemic that circles the globe, according to many of the world’s leading infectious disease experts.

The prospect is daunting. A pandemic — an ongoing epidemic on two or more continents — may well have global consequences, despite the extraordinary travel restrictions and quarantines now imposed by China and other countries, including the United States.

Scientists do not yet know how lethal the new coronavirus is, however, so there is uncertainty about how much damage a pandemic might cause. But there is growing consensus that the pathogen is readily transmitted between humans.

The Wuhan coronavirus is spreading more like influenza, which is highly transmissible, than like its slow-moving viral cousins, SARS and MERS, scientists have found.

“It’s very, very transmissible, and it almost certainly is going to be a pandemic,” said Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease.

“But will it be catastrophic? I don’t know.”

In the last three weeks, the number of lab-confirmed cases has soared from about 50 in China to 14,000 in 23 countries; there have been over 300 deaths, all but one in China.

But various epidemiological models estimate that the real number of cases is 100,000 or even more. While that expansion is not as rapid as that of flu or measles, it is an enormous leap beyond what virologists saw when SARS and MERS emerged.

When SARS was vanquished in July 2003 after spreading for nine months, only 8,098 cases had been confirmed. MERS has been circulating since 2012, but there have been only about 2,500 known cases.

The biggest uncertainty now, experts said, is how many people around the world will die. SARS killed about 10 percent of those who got it, and MERS now kills about one of three.
The 1918 “Spanish flu” killed only about 2.5 percent of its victims — but because it infected so many people and medical care was much cruder then, 20 to 50 million died.

By contrast, the highly transmissible H1N1 “swine flu” pandemic of 2009 killed about 285,000, fewer than seasonal flu normally does, and had a relatively low fatality rate, estimated at .02 percent.

The mortality rate for known cases of the Wuhan coronavirus has been running about 2 percent, although that is likely to drop as more tests are done and more mild cases are found.

It is “increasingly unlikely that the virus can be contained,” said Dr. Thomas R. Frieden, a former director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention who now runs Resolve to Save Lives, a nonprofit devoted to fighting epidemics.

“It is therefore likely that it will spread, as flu and other organisms do, but we still don’t know how far, wide or deadly it will be.”
In the early days of the 2009 flu pandemic, “they were talking about Armageddon in Mexico,” Dr. Fauci said. (That virus first emerged in pig-farming areas in Mexico’s Veracruz State.) “But it turned out to not be that severe.”

An accurate estimate of the virus’s lethality will not be possible until certain kinds of studies can be done: blood tests to see how many people have antibodies, household studies to learn how often it infects family members, and genetic sequencing to determine whether some strains are more dangerous than others.

Closing borders to highly infectious pathogens never succeeds completely, experts said, because all frontiers are somewhat porous. Nonetheless, closings and rigorous screening may slow the spread, which will buy time for the development of drug treatments and vaccines.

Other important unknowns include who is most at risk, whether coughing or contaminated surfaces are more likely to transmit the virus, how fast the virus can mutate and whether it will fade out when the weather warms.

Coronavirus Map: Tracking the Spread of the Outbreak
The virus has sickened more than 14,500 people in China and 23 other countries.
The effects of a pandemic would probably be harsher in some countries than in others. While the United States and other wealthy countries may be able to detect and quarantine the first carriers, countries with fragile health care systems will not. The virus has already reached Cambodia, India, Malaysia, Nepal, the Philippines and rural Russia.

“This looks far more like H1N1’s spread than SARS, and I am increasingly alarmed,” said Dr. Peter Piot, director of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine. “Even 1 percent mortality would mean 10,000 deaths in each million people.”
Other experts were more cautious.

Dr. Michael Ryan, head of emergency responses for the World Health Organization, said in an interview with STAT News on Saturday that there was “evidence to suggest this virus can still be contained” and that the world needed to “keep trying.”

Dr. W. Ian Lipkin, a virus-hunter at the Columbia University Mailman School of Public Health who is in China advising its Center for Disease Control and Prevention, said that although the virus is clearly being transmitted through casual contact, labs are still behind in processing samples.

But life in China has radically changed in the last two weeks. Streets are deserted, public events are canceled, and citizens are wearing masks and washing their hands, Dr. Lipkin said. All of that may have slowed down what lab testing indicated was exponential growth in the infection.

It’s unclear exactly how accurate tests done in overwhelmed Chinese laboratories are. On the one hand, Chinese state media have reported test kit shortages and processing bottlenecks, which could produce an undercount.

But Dr. Lipkin said he knew of one lab running 5,000 samples a day, which might produce some false-positive results, inflating the count. “You can’t possibly do quality control at that rate,” he said.

Anecdotal reports from China, and one published study from Germany, indicate that some people infected with the Wuhan coronavirus can pass it on before they show symptoms. That may make border-screening much harder, scientists said.
Epidemiological modeling released Friday by the European Center for Disease Prevention and Control estimated that 75 percent of infected people reaching Europe from China would still be in the incubation periods upon arrival, and therefore not detected by airport screening, which looks for fevers, coughs and breathing difficulties.

But if thermal cameras miss victims who are beyond incubation and actively infecting others, the real number of missed carriers may be higher than 75 percent.

Still, asymptomatic carriers “are not normally major drivers of epidemics,” Dr. Fauci said. Most people get ill from someone they know to be sick — a family member, a co-worker or a patient, for example.

The virus’s most vulnerable target is Africa, many experts said. More than 1 million expatriate Chinese work there, mostly on mining, drilling or engineering projects. Also, many Africans work and study in China and other countries where the virus has been found.

If anyone on the continent has the virus now, “I’m not sure the diagnostic systems are in place to detect it,” said Dr. Daniel Bausch, head of scientific programs for the American Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene, who is consulting with the W.H.O. on the outbreak.

South Africa and Senegal could probably diagnose it, he said. Nigeria and some other countries have asked the W.H.O. for the genetic materials and training they need to perform diagnostic tests, but that will take time.

""Unverified"" because it's impossible to formally verify for you from a country with no independent press, but it's by people I personally know and trust. 

Just to be clear: Your concern is reasonable and you should apply this scrutiny to all unverified reports that come out of China, including those by Chinese authorities - which are notorious for faking data.

>It's too big of a deal to stay covered up if true.

That's not how it works in China. How do you imagine you'd ever get definite proof? The people responsible or witnesses would have to talk to foreign press, which isn't likely to happen. At most you get anonymous reports. I think a lot of people in the West are really underestimating how closed off China has become in terms of reporting under Xi. All you get these days are ""rumors"". And if you're really lucky some investigative reports from Hong Kong journalists risking their lives going undercover. But from what I've seen on reddit most Westerners will dismiss these as unreliable too, because they don't read Chinese and don't know the HK outlets publishing these stories."

<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<

Scientists do not yet know how lethal the new coronavirus is, however, so there is uncertainty about how much damage a pandemic might cause. But there is growing consensus that the pathogen is readily transmitted between humans.

The Wuhan coronavirus is spreading more like influenza, which is highly transmissible, than like its slow-moving viral cousins, SARS and MERS, scientists have found.

“It’s very, very transmissible, and it almost certainly is going to be a pandemic,” said Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease.

“But will it be catastrophic? I don’t know.”


<<<<<<<<<<<

It is “increasingly unlikely that the virus can be contained,” said Dr. Thomas R. Frieden, a former director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention who now runs Resolve to Save Lives, a nonprofit devoted to fighting epidemics.

“It is therefore likely that it will spread, as flu and other organisms do, but we still don’t know how far, wide or deadly it will be.”

In the early days of the 2009 flu pandemic, “they were talking about Armageddon in Mexico,” Dr. Fauci said. (That virus first emerged in pig-farming areas in Mexico’s Veracruz State.) “But it turned out to not be that severe.”"
2020-02-02,InsanePurple,badmathematics,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/badmathematics/comments/extz9g/this_is_more_rbadepidemiology_but_coronavirus_is/fgdih6i/,"I think the point is that the lethality rate for c-virus is a lot higher. Like 'If coronavirus were to spread similarly to Spanish flu, there would be a lot more deaths'. I'm not sure if that's how the ratio of deaths/infections changes as infections increases, but that's more biology than math. Assuming it's constant doesn't strike me as being super unreasonable, and under that assumption the math is valid. 


Basically, if this person is making a mistake, it's with the way disease spreads and changes lethality. The math itself is correct."

The reason for that is because Tamiflu works by inhibiting neuraminidase (a specific enzyme) on the surface of the influenza virus. In particular this enzyme is what allows the flu to spread so inhibiting it stops the spread and helps you get over the flu faster.

Unfortunately, Coronavirus is a different species of virus and does not have neuraminidase on it so the drug wouldn’t be effective because, well, there is no enzyme for it to inhibit."

> Singapore has been taking measures to reduce the risk of imported cases of the Wuhan coronavirus, and of the pathogen spreading within the community here.

> On Saturday, it began imposing stricter travel restrictions on visitors who have been to China in the past 14 days, barring them from entry or transit through Singapore.

The coronavirus has pretty much all the hallmarks of a disease that could lead to a catastrophically bad pandemic. If you know you're history and a bit about the science behind epidemiology, it is presenting with some \*very\* worrying red flags.

Even if it doesn't have a high CFR (and this is far from conclusively determined -- there's ample and mounting circumstantial evidence that the Chinese are lying about the facts and figures) it's going to wreak havoc on the global economy. 

Best case scenario at this point is that it throws us into a global recession. Worst case is a global pandemic with a CFR, R0 and attack rate higher than influenza, coupled with a much longer incubation period and much longer recovery period. 

 You CANNOT just dismiss this as ""doom and gloom"" -- the only way to get through a scenario like what we may be facing, is to face it head on, calmly, and with rational plans and back up plans.

Coronaviruses are a group of viruses that cause diseases in mammals and birds. In humans, the viruses cause respiratory infections which are typically mild, including the common cold; however, rarer forms such as SARS, MERS and the novel coronavirus causing the current outbreak can be lethal. In cows and pigs they may cause diarrhea, while in chickens they can cause an upper respiratory disease. There are no vaccines or antiviral drugs that are approved for prevention or treatment.

Aren't the worst symptoms over relatively quickly, then you see a steady improvement?  Considering that this has more severe symptoms than the common cold, wouldn't it make sense that the recovery time was longer than the common cold?

42% is simply an upper bound, and that number has been dropping. 2% provides us a lower bound, but interestingly that number has been dropping.  Curiously however, if you slice the data to just include Hubei, you see a death rate of over 3%.  But I imagine that death probably comes within 2-3 days of symptom onset for most of the deaths.  This gives a death rate of somewhere around 3.2%-3.7%.  Of course this is assuming that all of the Chinese numbers are correct...

But even 2% is exceptionally bad if this becomes a global pandemic.  The infamous spanish influenza is estimated to have killed between 2-2.5% of its victims.

Anyone who compares the wuhan coronavirus to the modern flu strains should be called out on it, because modern flu strains have over an order of magnitude lower mortality rate, but at the same time to misinterpret statistics such as the recovery rate is just as bad."

But I could also see a reason for the opposite priority in testing.

If somebody is critical / severe, then they are probably going to be treated as if they have the coronavirus as far as isolation/quarantine measures go. And, because they are severe cases, they won't be traveling around much, potentially exposing more people. However, the more mild cases might not be immediatley treated with full quarantine, and they are more likely to be able to travel around and be in contact with more people. Putting a priority on testing them to prevent further spread might make sense, especially if there would not be any substantial change in the care of the severe patients if they were found positive.

This is just speculation from me, from a place of no particular knowledge or authority. Happy to be proven wrong / disagreed with!"
2020-02-02,stavd3,Coronavirus,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/exv5a4/so_now_experts_say_this_will_become_a_global/fgeegos/,"Since when does 2% of all people mean 5% in the children? You're gonna need to source that claim. Not to mention that most sources have said that most of the deaths are occurring in the elderly, not children. And again, even if there are five thousand cases, thats 5000/320000000, or .0016% of the US population. Assuming that the death rate is 2%, or average in most children (which is being generous given that the most vulnerable people right now are the elderly), that means that in this (hypothetical) scenario, the chances of any one child dying from nCoV are approximately one in 3 million. You claim you told your wife that your kids had a 5% chance of dying, or 1 in 20. That means that, even in this scenario where there are actually 20 times more cases than are being reported, you are overestimating the chances of your kids dying by 14,999,900%, or approximately 15 million percent.

Look, I'm not trying to tell you how to raise your kids; That's up to you and your wife. But if you are trying to making an argument that you need to quarantine your kids because coronavirus is going to kill millions of people (again, there have been only 8 confirmed cases in the US), then you better start using more evidence than what you've got right now.

We never know when a hurricane, tsunami, earthquake, meteor, war, outbreak and whatnot will happen and we will be stuck in your home for 1 week without electricity until someone rescue us. If your supplies are getting old, you can use them and put new ones there, renewing your stock, so nothing will rot.

And when those things happen, people run to the super markets and buy the things most of people use when they have to be isolated at home, so they ran out of stock quickly.

Antipyretics, pain killers and whatnot are always good. Some alcohol, sanitize gel to disinfect things or parts of your body. Canned food, some source of protein. Gallons for water. Get a portable charger for your phone and if you can even some addicting things like cigarettes, alcohol and candies just in case you need to trade with someone.

As I said, when people panic, valuable resources ran out of stock, so it's good to have a small reserve at home. Let's suppose you cut your arm but there are no anti-inflammatory available and the hospitals are crowded for some reason. Not because of coronavirus in specific, but in case of any unexpected event that might happen in the future. So having supplies that you might use if you need to stay at home for 1 month and things that you can trade with your neighbors for supplies you don't have (water, medication...) is good.

I even renew my stock of seeds every year, with 50$ you can get thousands of seeds (I have a lot of room to farm though).

Just in case, better safe than sorry. I started preparing myself when police went on strike in a city here in Brazil years ago, the crime rate there skyrocketed, and it was a ""safe"" city. I live in Rio de Janeiro and even with police the crime rate is high and carrying gun is illegal here, if it happened in my city we would be screwed, since the criminals have illegal guns anyway and even having a license to have a gun at home is extremely difficult.

You dont seem to understand WHY antibiotic resistance is built with longer courses. Because the bacteria we have problems with are oportunistic bacteria that are already in your body normally. And THEY survive and develop resistance wheter you complete your course or not. Because the aim of the treatment is not to kill the bacteria normally in your body. IF you let the bacteria that was actually causing you problems survive, it would build resistance, but it is not as serious a problem as bacteria that always lives on us, since they go through this with multiple antibiotics, and thus become poly resistant. It is the ones you damage collaterally. Given that antivirals are targeted and specific, it is unlikely to happen with viruses.

It is important to understand what you are talking about so that you dont talk out of context. You are wrong regarding HIV, which is what I was talking about, and you are very likely wrong about coronavirus/flu. Evolutionary pressures and population mechanics are well understood subjects. It is just that with antibiotics we were looking at the wrong population."

In the 70's, China a had not one, but two lab-related virus outbreaks (SARS and Bird Flu). This establishes precedent, across more than one time, that can be confirmed to have happened.


The first several patients apparently had no connection to the wet markets (however, with up to 2 weeks incubation, they could have possibly contacted somebody who does, and displayed symptoms earlier than  initial infections by a matter of up to two weeks. Apparently as short as 15 minutes can spread shedding virii through multiple semi-airborn methods).

Surgical masks stop the spread, but do not prevent infection. They filter one way. They do not protect the wearer, and are also disposable which means they degrade rapidly and must be replace.

Every other mask, i.e. work masks at the highest rating for dust, asbestos, lead, fumes, etc do not block pathogens.

If you get the gas mask that gives you eye coverage and face coverage, you will still need the special filter for pathogens otherwise you can still be infected. These filters are disposable, but last longer than normal surgical masks.

Those dust masks the officials were wearing in the article do nothing and while comfier than normal gas masks are more expensive for 0% increase in protection.

Your options are only surgical masks, the gas mask with correct filter, and HAZMAT.

Wash your hands, avoid touching your face\mouth\eyes\nose, avoid populated areas, avoid known sick people, do not goto hospitals unless you need to.

Probably also sanitize your phone. But thats less coronavirus and more just, you wash your hands and then touch your phone that you were touching with your unwashed hands."

There is an enzyme the virus uses to cut up this blob of proteins into each specific part. The HIV drugs attach to this cutting enzyme, and stop it from cutting the blob protein into all the different functional bits.

The HIV drug is designed to specifically attach to the HIV cutting enzyme, so it probably doesn't work terribly well on the coronavirus cutting enzyme, but we may be able to make a drug specifically for coronavirus that is going to target that enzyme much more effectively, and pretty much stop the virus from reproducing itself. It would basically be like a kind of antibiotic for the virus.

This is a huge deal because antibiotics don't work on viruses, the standard treatment is pretty much to keep the patients alive and hope for their body to fight off the virus. Having an actual medicine to give people is going to be a game-changer."

tbf, it will be totally not a problem in a year as that new virus will kill many of those soon to be receivers of pensions:

> Of course, deaths are not the only impactful metric by far - there would be far more seriously ill people than those who die. In addition to the many millions who would die, many more would become severely ill and need hospital care. How many? Right now the WHO estimates 20%. https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.nytimes.com/article/what-is-coronavirus.amp.html Some of them will be critically ill with Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome and multiple organ failure (common complications of this virus), requiring ICU level care with full ventilation. There are only a hundred thousand or so ICU beds in the entire United States, a highly developed first world country. Even if only a small percentage of the 7.2 million severely ill people in America need ICU treatment to survive (assuming the lower 11% infection figure), you’re easily exceeding the entire country’s ICU capacity many times over. And, of course, ICU beds don’t just sit around empty all the time when there is no pandemic around, and people don’t stop needing the ICU for other non-pandemic things just because a pandemic is happening. The same applies to regularly staffed hospital beds, of which America only has roughly a million of. To treat 7.2 million severely ill people. On the low end. Now imagine you live in West Africa or a poorer district of India - how do you think the hospital situation there would fare with such influx?
> 
> So you can see why a pandemic coronavirus is likely not on the same level as the common flu or heart disease or whatever random common thing people online are comparing it to. If it happens, it will be a highly memorable world event, killing perhaps a fourth to a half as many people who died in World War 2 - assuming no more than 20% of people in the world catch it, and assuming health care can keep up so that otherwise manageable cases aren’t triaged or just neglected into a fatality, which might be asking a lot. In a “really bad” scenario, 100 million plus deaths across the globe is probably not out of the question. At some point it gets bad enough that you have to start taking into account the effect of collapsed supply chains, production shortages, and breakdowns in civil order. Which is way beyond back of the envelope.

It's like p-hacking, but they didn't even bother hiding it behind stats. Not an attack on you, but a scientific mind would look at what makes HIV so scary. That would be its rapid mutation rate, where entire segments of its RNA get reshuffled.

Let's talk about the one unique change, because the other 3 ""changes"" have been previously catalogued in a bat coronavirus in 2013. So the match on HIV that they have is a sample in the Indian biobank (from memory), not pure HIV. This is because pure HIV doesn't exist...it always in strains. You'd also expect a bunch of hits on this area by chance (relying on secondhand analysis here, I've done bioinformatics but I'm a data guy, not a biologist) because a) the PARTIAL match was to an area of HIV genome known to rapidly mutate and the area of the nCov genome was one that typically has low selection pressure. That means it can vary without affecting the organism itself.

One bit of information I'd like to see is the total number of regions that differ from SARS. If it was in the paper my memory has blocked it out, because I was thumping my head by the end of it. They made no attempt to let the data speak to them, rather, they started from their conclusion and proceeded accordingly. Not uncommon in science, truly irresponsible with the global panic going down.

Is that to say it's not engineered? No, it might be. But I very much doubt it's in the way that 4 unknown Indian scientists from some unknown university say, and parsimony would suggest that this is more like the earlier coronavirus detected in 2013. To show that it was a bioweapon would require EXTRAORDINARY evidence, very well supported, with all possible alternatives accounted for. My bet is this is a quick grab for fame and headlines, that will never be punished after this blows over."
2020-02-02,vilekangaree,China,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/China/comments/exyjr0/virus_pummels_wuhan_a_city_short_of_supplies_and/fge4cgu/,"WUHAN, China — Weak with fever, An Jianhua waited in line for seven hours outside the hospital in the cold, hoping to get tested for the new coronavirus, which doctors suspected she had contracted.

Ms. An, 67, needed an official diagnosis from a hospital to qualify for treatment, but the one she and her son raced to last week had no space, even to test her. The next hospital they were referred to here in Wuhan, the  city of 11 million people at the center of the outbreak, was full, too, they said. They finally got an intravenous drip for Ms. An’s fever, but that was all.

Since then, Ms. An has quarantined herself at home. She and her son eat separately, wear masks at home and are constantly disinfecting their apartment. Ms. An’s health is declining rapidly, and even keeping water down is a struggle.

“I can’t let my mom die at home,” said her son, He Jun. “Every day I want to cry, but when I cry there are no tears. There is no hope.”

As countries race to deal with an outbreak that has begun spreading around the world, inciting panic and disrupting the global economy, the residents of Wuhan are waging a daily battle to survive an illness that has sickened more than 4,100 people and killed 224 in their city alone.

Last month, the government put Wuhan in a virtual lockdown, sealing off the city and banning most public transportation and private cars from its streets in a desperate effort to contain the outbreak. Now, many residents say it is nearly impossible to get the health care they need to treat — or even diagnose — the coronavirus.

Expressing exasperation, doctors say there is a shortage of testing kits and other medical supplies, and it is not clear why more are not available. The ban on transportation means some residents have to walk for hours to get to hospitals — if they are well enough to make the journey. Layers of bureaucracy stand between residents and help. And the long lines outside hospitals for testing and treatment suggest that the outbreak is spreading far beyond the official count of cases.

Ambulances, too, are hard to come by, residents say. In recent days, some say they have called 120, China’s equivalent of the emergency number 911, only to be told that there were already hundreds of people in the queue.

Those who do make it to the hospital say they are squeezed together for hours in waiting rooms, where infections are easily spread. But the shortages have meant that many are ultimately turned away and sent home to self-quarantine, potentially compounding the outbreak by exposing their families.

Many doctors and residents are putting their hopes on the two new coronavirus hospitals that China has been racing to build in Wuhan in just a matter of days. One of them spans about eight acres, has 1,000 beds and is scheduled to open on Monday. The government says 1,400 military medical workers will be deployed to work there, potentially helping with the shortage of health professionals on hand to combat the outbreak.

On Sunday, city officials announced plans to set up quarantine stations around Wuhan for people with symptoms of pneumonia and close contacts among coronavirus patients. But just over a week into the lockdown, many residents believe the virus has already spread much further than the official numbers suggest.

“The situation that we’ve seen is much worse than what has been officially reported,” Long Jian, 32, said outside a hospital where his elderly father was being treated. Mr. Long said his father had to go to six hospitals and wait seven days before he could even be tested for the coronavirus.

Just steps from where Mr. Long spoke, beds could be seen lining both sides of a narrow corridor in the emergency room. One man was getting an intravenous drip outside in his car.

“Those who can get diagnosed and treated are the lucky ones,” Mr. Long said. “In our neighborhood, many who weren’t able to get diagnosed ended up dying at home.”

Getting treatment for the coronavirus in a hospital requires jumping through a number of hoops.

According to official guidelines, patients are encouraged to go to their local hospitals first for initial assessments and sometimes prescriptions. Then patients are to deliver the results to their local neighborhood committees, which are responsible for communicating with the hospitals and coordinating resources for the households in their areas. There are about 1,000 neighborhood committees in Wuhan, for a population of 11 million.

Patients with mild symptoms are typically told to go home and self-quarantine, according to a Jan. 24 notice by city officials. Those who have more severe symptoms are flagged by the neighborhood committees, which arrange for transportation by ambulance to one of the two dozen or so hospitals designated for treating the coronavirus.

But in practice, patients and their relatives say that the process takes far too long, and that the bar for what constitutes “severe symptoms” has been set too high — so they give up and try waiting in long lines at hospitals instead.

Amy Hu said her 64-year-old mother went to the doctor after experiencing a fever, cough, shortness of breath and diarrhea about 10 days ago. Based on the initial assessment, the doctor told Ms. Hu’s mother that she had contracted the coronavirus. But the test needed to confirm the diagnosis was not available, the doctor said.

Without the test, her mother couldn’t be admitted to a hospital. Since then, Ms. Hu said, they have been waiting at home to hear back from the hospital about when her mother can be tested. In recent days Ms. Hu, who has been visiting her parents for the Lunar New Year holiday, took precautions herself: She checked into a hostel with her two children.

“I’m very dissatisfied with the government,” Ms. Hu said. “It’s like only when the patients are close to death can they be admitted to a hospital.”

Tong Yixuan, 31, said Sunday that he panicked last week when he learned that in just a few days, his father’s cold had escalated into a full-blown illness that doctors said was almost certainly the coronavirus.

But neither his father, who had a 104-degree fever and was slipping in and out of consciousness, nor his mother, who was starting to show similar symptoms, could get tested. Hospitals said that there was no space, and that their symptoms were not severe enough, Mr. Tong said. His parents were sent home to quarantine themselves.

There was no way for Mr. Tong to help. He was more than 60 miles away in Huangshi, which days ago had been locked down by the government along with many other cities in Hubei Province. The roads out of Huangshi and into Wuhan had all been sealed off. For days, Mr. Tong was stuck. Only Saturday, after hours of negotiation with local officials, was he able to make it to his parents’ bedside, he said. They have since been tested for the coronavirus, and his father has been admitted to a hospital. The process took 10 days.

“All I want to do is take care of my parents,” Mr. Tong said. “I don’t even care if I get infected.”

For some people, like Gan Hanjiang, the new hospitals cannot be built fast enough.

Last month, his father came down with a severe fever and cough. He was tested for the coronavirus, but the results were negative. Ten days after the onset of symptoms, however, his father died, Mr. Gan said.

The hospital classified the cause as “severe pneumonia,” Mr. Gan said, but he believes it was the coronavirus. Several experts have recently conceded that several rounds of testing may be needed for an accurate diagnosis of the virus.

On the day his father died, Mr. Gan began to show the same symptoms, he said. But without a car, he has not been able to go to one of the designated hospitals to get tested for the coronavirus.

“Getting treatment is so difficult,” he whispered slowly by telephone from a small hospital near his home where he was being treated for viral pneumonia. “We can’t get admitted to the hospitals. And there’s not enough medicine.”

The odds of you dying from it are like 1 in 50, but to be fair everyone that's died of it so far has been immunocompromised by age or health, so, if you're healthy, your odds of dying from it are functionally zero.

Never mind being infected by a flu-like virus. You've been infected by the mind-virus that is media sensationalism with racist understones."

Like pregnancy tests from pharmacy and actual blood tests in lab in order to know if a person is pregnant.
In US and Brazil some tests are taking days in order to get a accurate result.
In China it works in 15 minutes though, very quickly. Hubei is already using those tests, but they aren't in max production right now. They started testing in labs but with a capacity of 500 daily, when it increased I believe it was because the test kits were developed.

Their plan is be able to produce 4000 tests per day, but they are producing less than that now (I'm not sure how much).

Although I read about two cases 1 in China and another in Japan where the tests gave negative results to people with symptoms, but when tested again they got positive results.
In China the guy had fever 20th January, was tested 25th, 26th and 28th and got negative results, even with symptoms, then 30th January they tested again and the result was positive.
In Japan some people they took back from quarantine had symptoms, but the results were negative, but a second test on a man gave a positive result.
(I can find the source if you don't find it googling).

The tests aren't 100% but it would be impossible to test everyone in labs since it can take hours or days, and there are more than 20000 suspected."

The biggest determining factor for mass proliferation of the coronavirus is the extent to which cities outside of Wuhan are subject to mass infections.  So far, it's comparatively few, but we'll know within the next week.  This will undoubtedly also determine the global risk, as even though a quarantine of 50mil seems excessive and overwrought, it's a much easier task than wholesale containing its spread within the whole of China (good luck with that, if it comes to pass).

From a limited set of observations from a finite population in a finite time interval, the total population can be estimated. What's described here is a case of Baysian inference. In fact that's exactly what epidemiological studies are trying to do and why they say, from the cases observed, there are likely over 100,000 infected right now even if the official number is only <20,000.

While this case alone indicates little, it can point more cases existing than officially admitted by the chinese government, a fact which at this point has essentially been established since even on the 12th human-human case transmission had yet to be established: [https://www.who.int/csr/don/12-january-2020-novel-coronavirus-china/en/](https://www.who.int/csr/don/12-january-2020-novel-coronavirus-china/en/) and the 15th was the first day human-human transmission was even suggested [https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/15/world/asia/coronavirus-japan-china.html](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/15/world/asia/coronavirus-japan-china.html) by chinese authorities. In fact, if we believe the chiense authority about the probability at the time, the chance of his infection should be 0 because they didnt fully admit to the possibility of human-human infection yet.

I happen to think the OP's claim that

>I’m beginning to think that the highest ranges of number of infected  people from the studies published in The Lancet - \~78,000 on Jan 25th -  might be actually underestimated a lot and there might have been dozens  thousands infected as early as Jan 15th.

is wrong for the reasons you give and I think epidemiologist know that we have an observation bias. But the claim that

>nobody seemed to notice how odd and unlikely this case is if we’re to believe official numbers

is probably true and this case does add a point towards the chinese government hiding cases at the beginning of the outbreak. I dont think the patient is unlucky, I think the patient is a subject of the chinese government hiding the numbers for an already growing epidemic.

You're treating his whole post as making one claim, it is not making one claim it makes multiple."

It also has never been used to treat HIV. Nucleotide analogs can be non-specific since they do not operate as I described, but instead the virus is tricked into using something other than AGUC nucleotides in order to replicate themselves, and so create faulty viruses.

Remdesivir was also shown to be largely ineffective against Ebola. That it seems to be effective on the coronavirus family leads decent hope. However there is no ""one size fits all"" treatment for all viruses, and all antivirals do not work the same and so cannot be effective against all viruses.

Just FYI, Ebola and Marburg are both Filoviruses.
SARS, Syncytica and MERS are all Coronaviruses.
Lassa and Junin are both Bunyaviruses.

All of which share similar nucleocapsid compositions (the protein that surrounds the RNA) which is probably why they work, without looking into it further."

In the couple nights before I left, the Didi (local rideshare) drivers I'd used for rides around town said variously that they were refusing pick-ups from hospitals, train stations, and airports, as well as requiring masks on all passengers. The mood in the neighborhood around where my mom lived (and I was staying) was equally cautious- practically no one on the streets, the very few people out and about all had face masks on, and the few businesses still running seemed to be having some trouble bringing customers in (local department store was offering 100% back in vouchers good on your next visit if you spent more than 100 RMB = US$15, bakeries were doing the end-of-day buy 3 get 1 free sales all day, etc).

At the airport, they're doing temperature checks on the way through exit control, presumably ready to catch anyone showing symptoms before they can leave the country. Everyone seemed to be talking about the coronavirus, it was all I overheard in the lounge while waiting for my flight. 

Once onboard, though, people seemed to relax some, and it felt like any other China-Japan flight minus the fact that everyone had masks on until arriving in NGO, and also that every seat was full and I still somehow managed to book an Avios award on it less than a week from departure. Either JAL was making every last seat available for partner redemption or there were a lot of people making bookings at the very last minute looking to leave. There was a request from the Japanese government to self-report to the quarantine desk if you'd started showing symptoms or were taking medications to reduce/hide symptoms, though. 

So yeah, people are very much on edge in Shanghai, and not unjustified given that Shanghai is also a major hub city for migrant workers from out of town."

At least four African countries have suspect cases quarantined, according to an article published Friday in The South China Morning Post. They have sent samples to France, Germany, India and South Africa for testing.
[Like the Science Times page on Facebook. | Sign up for the Science Times newsletter.]

At the moment, it seems unlikely that the virus will spread widely in countries with vigorous, alert public health systems, said Dr. William Schaffner, a preventive medicine specialist at Vanderbilt University Medical Center.

“Every doctor in the U.S. has this top of mind,” he said. “Any patient with fever or respiratory problems will get two questions. ‘Have you been to China? Have you had contact with anyone who has?’ If the answer is yes, they’ll be put in isolation right away.”

Assuming the virus spreads globally, tourism to and trade with countries besides China may be affected — and the urgency to find ways to halt the virus and prevent deaths will grow.

It is possible that the Wuhan coronavirus will fade out as weather warms. Many viruses, like flu, measles and norovirus, thrive in cold, dry air. The SARS outbreak began in winter, and MERS transmission also peaks then, though that may be related to transmission in newborn camels.

Four mild coronaviruses cause about a quarter of the nation’s common colds, which also peak in winter.

But even if an outbreak fades in June, there could be a second wave in the fall, as has occurred in every major flu pandemic, including those that began in 1918 and 2009.

By that time, some remedies might be on hand, although they will need rigorous testing and perhaps political pressure to make them available and affordable.

In China, several antiviral drugs are being prescribed. A common combination is pills containing lopinavir and ritonavir with infusions of interferon, a signaling protein that wakes up the immune system.

In the United States, the combination is sold as Kaletra by AbbVie for H.I.V. therapy, and it is relatively expensive. In India, a dozen generic makers produce the drugs at rock-bottom prices for use against H.I.V. in Africa, and their products are W.H.O.-approved.

Another option may be an experimental drug, remdesivir, on which the patent is held by Gilead. The drug has not yet been approved for use against any disease. Nonetheless, there is some evidence that it works against coronaviruses, and Gilead has donated doses to China.

Several American companies are working on a vaccine, using various combinations of their own funds, taxpayer money and foundation grants.

Although modern gene-chemistry techniques have made it possible to build vaccine candidates within just days, medical ethics require that they then be carefully tested on animals and small numbers of healthy humans for safety and effectiveness.

That aspect of the process cannot be sped up, because dangerous side effects may take time to appear and because human immune systems need time to produce the antibodies that show whether a vaccine is working.
Whether or not what is being hu in China will be acceptable elsewhere will depend on how rigorously Chinese doctors run their clinical trials.

“In God we trust,” Dr. Schaffner said. “All others must provide data.”"

I've been traveling back and forth to Japan for two decades. The issue is not with the Japanese, they understand the need for sanitary and clean conditions. They wear N95 masks, if they feel the slightest bit ill, or even when they aren't. You can see it in almost any bathroom they have in stores, in restaurants and public areas. They always provide alcohol spray to sanitize your hands before you leave. Even at the entrance to major department stores and supermarkets you'll find hand sanitizer. The issue is with the hundreds of thousands of Chinese tourists that are still being let into the country.

Japan's economy is heavily dependent on tourism and Chinese tourists are a large part of that. The Japanese government doesn't want to offend the Chinese government by singling out Chinese Tourists out of fear that some of them may bring the Coronavirus to Japan. So they can only do a body temperature scan upon landing. And now they are only limiting their travel ban to people from Wuhan. Not the other provinces where people have been infected. 

Best advice is wear masks, wash your hands constantly and use hand sanitizer. Also bring your own paper hand towels to dry with. Many restrooms don't have paper towels and just offer electric hand dryers. The problem with those are they can be breeding grounds for germs and viruses.  I also advise staying away from the very touristy part of Tokyo, like Ginza, because that's where the Chinese Tourists flock to the most. Kyoto is also going to be very inundated with Chinese Tourists. Particularly the Golden Temple and other ancient sites. Just tell her to keep the mask on avoid touching her face, before she washes her hands. 

Good luck."

We have confirmed cases of asymptomatic spreading, but not many. Mostly it is still spread by people who already are showing symptoms. (Which is a good thing.)

Also, 14 days is the upper bound for incubation. For most it is significantly lower. It might still be possible for this to be curtailed, to a degree. It's really a borderline case for a pandemic. We don't really know right now. It is possible it'll become endemic in large parts of the world, but not quickly. If we lose the battle for control, it'll eventually spread all over. But it'll take months. And it might become less severe while it spreads, that is what usually happens (while also becoming more infectious). In that scenario, we might eventually have Coronavirus season just as we have flu season, with similar rates of fatalities (higher than most people think for the flu), which would be a fairly big hit for public health in the long run.

If you are a student studying in Australia, this is the advice being shared by the Qld Dept of Ed (and I believe other states are similar.)

**Novel Coronavirus FAQs**

Department of Education - 31 Jan

**What is the current advice from health authorities regarding education providers?**

• anyone who has been in contact with any confirmed novel Coronavirus cases must self-isolate

(self-isolation means staying at home and not accepting visitors) for 14 days following exposure

• travellers who have visited Hubei Province of China need to self-isolate for 14 days after leaving

Hubei Province

• returned travellers who have visited China cannot attend school, childcare or TAFE for 14 days

after leaving China including Hong Kong.

**What are the symptoms of novel Corona virus?**

A number of clinical symptoms have been reported in identified cases of novel coronavirus. These

symptoms include:

• Fever

• Flu-like symptoms such as a cough, sore throat or headache

• Difficulty breathing.

Anyone with these symptoms who has travelled to or through China in the past 14 days should visit

a GP immediately. Please call ahead and advise of your symptoms and recent travel before your

appointment so the clinic can take necessary precautions.

People with suspected novel coronavirus will be tested and may also need to have a chest x-ray.

There is no specific treatment for 2019-nCoV infection. Antibiotics are not effective against viral

infections. However, most of the symptoms can be treated with supportive medical care. There is

currently no vaccine for coronavirus.

If you have travelled to China in the last 14 days and are unwell you can call 13 HEALTH (13 43 25 84)

for health advice.

When does the self-isolation period start?

The 14 day period starts when the person has left China **(including Hong Kong).**"

In any case, asymptomatic transition isn't the really big problem - though it would be a big deal. It's people with very minor symptoms, which are often ignored by the person and missed by screening.

In terms of objective severity, January's events were really like Coronavirus >>> Australian Bushfires >>>>>>>>>>>>>>> WW3 actually breaking out. The rolling average for death rates in war have been calculated fairly accurately since the 1600s, and major 'global' wars see definite spikes and lead-ups prior to them, like a sine wave. We are at the bottom of a trough i.e. things are relatively peaceful, and death rates have only started to slowly climb up, but are not even at Cold War levels. I give at least 40 years until we'll be close to another major world war. The wildfires are definitely tragic, but the Australian authorities aren't letting them get too apocalyptically out of hand. The Coronavirus is both more severe than some people make it out to be, and also less severe than others are making it out to be. It'll likely be quite calamitous for China, and leave a lasting impact in East Asia. But it won't kill many people in the rest of the world. I think somewhere in between SARS and the Spanish Flu, but with deaths concentrated in poorer areas of China and East Asia.

If Bernie can bring people together and get his ideas instituted, why hasn't he done in all the years he's been there? What policy has he ever spearheaded in the Senate that came to pass? 

If Biden can bring people together and lead us into the future, why hasn't he done it? He's been a Washington inside forever, and when has he ever brought people together? My first memory of him was when he sold out the country, sneered at Anita Hill, and gave us the single stupidest Supreme Court justice in the history of that institution.

If Warren is the leader she claims to be, what has she done to show us she has those skills? She hasn't done it in the Senate, and all she's shown us in this campaign is that she's a hypocrite who criticizes others for doing what she's done for years.

All of them are mired in the same old 20th century thinking that led us to the point Trump could, in Pete's words, ""come within cheating distance of the White House.""

Pete is the only candidate, with the exception of Yang, who I like but who is not going to be the nominee, who can take us into the 21st century and the future.

Without Pete, it doesn't matter much what any Democratic president wants to do, they'll be stuck in the same old infighting and nothing much will improve.

(Yes, any Democrat would be better than Trump, because of SCOTUS, because of ICE and the thousands of immigrant children who are being abused, and because of Trump's executive orders.

A new coronavirus, designated 2019-nCoV, was identified in Wuhan, the capital of China's Hubei, after people developed pneumonia without a clear cause, and for which existing treatments were not effective. The virus has shown evidence of spread between people, with its transmission rate escalating in mid-January 2020 and several countries across Europe, North America and especially the Asia-Pacific reporting cases. Its incubation period (time from exposure to onset of symptoms) ranges from 2 to 14 days, but there is evidence that it may be contagious during this period and possibly also for several days after recovery. Symptoms include fever, coughing and breathing difficulties, and it can be fatal.As of 2 February 2020, approximately 17,386 cases have been confirmed, including in every province-level division of China.

The statement below features a vague antecedent (they, in this case), but you should have read ""zoonotic illnesses"" instead of ""coronaviruses"" in the place of they. I've worked with coronavirus and many other (+)ssRNA viruses, and I am confident that there are no reports of transmission of any coronavirus through mosquitos. A requisite for mosquito transmission would be that the virus infects the salivary glands of the mosquito, or at the very least the virus can infect any cell type of the mosquito. The results are no, coronaviruses do not replicate in these tissues. And lastly, in order to mosquito-based transmission to be sustained, coronavirus would have to be in the blood. Viremia (viral infection of the blood) can occur for many viruses once extraordinarily severe. Influenza, SARS, MERS, Ebola, etc, all of the viruses, including nCov, can induce viremia at very late and severe stages of infection, but this is so infrequent that it's not a feasible route of transmission--not to mention it's too cold in Wuhan for mosquitos.   

""They can be passed to humans through direct contact with animal feces and other secretions, contaminated food, indirect transmission via a conduit like water, or vector-borne transmission through mosquitoes, other insects, or even mammals, as is the case with rabies"""

> Of course, deaths are not the only impactful metric by far - there would be far more seriously ill people than those who die. In addition to the many millions who would die, many more would become severely ill and need hospital care. How many? Right now the WHO estimates 20%. https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.nytimes.com/article/what-is-coronavirus.amp.html Some of them will be critically ill with Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome and multiple organ failure (common complications of this virus), requiring ICU level care with full ventilation. There are only a hundred thousand or so ICU beds in the entire United States, a highly developed first world country. Even if only a small percentage of the 7.2 million severely ill people in America need ICU treatment to survive (assuming the lower 11% infection figure), you’re easily exceeding the entire country’s ICU capacity many times over. And, of course, ICU beds don’t just sit around empty all the time when there is no pandemic around, and people don’t stop needing the ICU for other non-pandemic things just because a pandemic is happening. The same applies to regularly staffed hospital beds, of which America only has roughly a million of. To treat 7.2 million severely ill people. On the low end. Now imagine you live in West Africa or a poorer district of India - how do you think the hospital situation there would fare with such influx?
> 
> So you can see why a pandemic coronavirus is likely not on the same level as the common flu or heart disease or whatever random common thing people online are comparing it to. If it happens, it will be a highly memorable world event, killing perhaps a fourth to a half as many people who died in World War 2 - assuming no more than 20% of people in the world catch it, and assuming health care can keep up so that otherwise manageable cases aren’t triaged or just neglected into a fatality, which might be asking a lot. In a “really bad” scenario, 100 million plus deaths across the globe is probably not out of the question. At some point it gets bad enough that you have to start taking into account the effect of collapsed supply chains, production shortages, and breakdowns in civil order. Which is way beyond back of the envelope.

Faced with information suppression and untrustworthy news, citizens in China and Hong Kong do their best to chronicle the coronavirus outbreak and sift fact from fiction.

coronavirus

MS. TECH

When Linda logged in to the Chinese social network Weibo on Monday, she saw a curious post from the state-controlled publication People’s Daily: Hubei province was adding 100,000 beds in hopes of handling the new coronavirus that has caused panic across the country. The number was jarring given official reports that only a few thousand people were infected, and people immediately began to respond with concern. The People’s Daily account quickly deleted the post and associated hashtag. 

Linda took a screenshot and saved it. (She asked that we use a pseudonym because she fears retaliation from the Chinese authorities. We verified her identity by asking her to send information from the accounts she uses to post her work.) Today Linda lives in northern China, but she’s a native of Wuhan, the capital of Hubei and the epicenter of the outbreak. She’d been in the city for the Lunar New Year holiday, but left to return home on January 22. Earlier in January she’d started collecting information about the virus to share with her family; back then they were “very relaxed” about the situation. 

But after concern grew worldwide, she decided to spend time collecting, translating, and archiving information as a form of public service. The Chinese government is famously willing to censor its citizens; already, it has deleted many posts criticizing the government for its handling of the outbreak, as well as stories of people affected by the virus. “I feared that [these accounts] would disappear,” Linda says, “and that people’s experiences won’t be reported. I just want to keep an emotional archive of some sort for people asking for help and affected by it, mostly patients and medical workers.” Not everything in the archive will be accurate, and she is aware of that risk, but not everything posted from government channels has been accurate either. 

Linda spends a few hours a day systematically collecting both official releases and personal accounts about the virus from social media like Weibo, WeChat, and Douban. She then translates or subtitles them into English and posts on Imgur, Reddit, Twitter, and YouTube. Though Linda says she’s “quite an unqualified social-media specialist,” some of her translations have received over 100,000 views. 

Since the first cases were reported in Wuhan at the end of December, the virus has infected nearly 12,000 people, killing over 200, and has spread to at least 20 countries. In an unprecedented move, people living in Wuhan, a city of 11 million, and surrounding cities have been quarantined. The quarantine affects more than 50 million people in all.

Verifying information in a rapidly changing situation is always a struggle, but it’s especially concerning in a country where there is no free press and citizens are suspicious about whether officials will tell the truth. “There is a clear reason why people don’t trust the government,” says Yaqiu Wang, a China researcher at Human Rights Watch. Plenty of people remember the lack of transparency during the 2003 SARS outbreak. During the 2008 earthquake in Sichuan, people trying to expose the truth were imprisoned, Wang adds, and “at the beginning of [this] January, people trying to tell the story [of the virus] were summoned by the police for rumor-mongering.”

Recently, Chinese state media spread a false picture of the hospital supposedly being built in Wuhan. There are plenty of hoaxes going around that the government is trying to quash, but also credible fears that the situation is worse than the authorities are reporting. In this situation, the line between paranoia and justified distrust can be razor thin. As frightening rumors and images spread across the world, citizens in mainland China and Hong Kong are taking the initiative.

Tiny news networks on social apps
While Linda is concerned with creating a chronicle of testimonies that might be deleted, others are operating mini-newsrooms using closed chat groups. Andy Tang, a 17-year-old in Hong Kong, runs a WhatsApp group called GloNews Room (as in “global news room”). Closed messaging apps like WeChat, WhatsApp, and Telegram have become increasingly popular ways of keeping up with the news given distrust of official sources. The curated nature, and the fact that it seems like a private communication app for friends, makes people feel that it’s a more trustworthy medium, Tang says. He likes WhatsApp because the members can receive instant notifications of his news updates. 

Friends began adding other friends, especially during the Hong Kong protests earlier this year, and GloNews Room’s membership has now grown to about 80 people. Tang, who has been covering the virus since late December, spends a couple of hours a day scouring the headlines. He will either write digests or directly share links, sometimes adding graphs of his own. Some of the work involves debunking rumors by checking them against other sources, such as a video of people eating bats that was actually made a few years ago and not connected to the current outbreak, he says. 

Two members of GloNews Room, Hong Kong teens Ken Chung and Ronald Lam, decided to create a more public version of the updates: a live map of the virus, along with headlines from major news sources. Most similar maps were created by Chinese media, says Chung, and there weren’t many that were in English or in the traditional Chinese used in Hong Kong and Taiwan. So he, Lam, and another friend produce their map in both languages, and try to update about every 15 minutes. In less than a week, the site has gathered one million unique visitors and 10 million views, with people visiting from Asia (especially Southeast Asia), North America, and Europe. 

Real or not real?
Everyone trying to understand information about the coronavirus must grapple with the lack of transparency. Linda says that she needs to balance her mistrust of government reports with skepticism about the posts she sees. The moderators of one subreddit initially took down some of her postings because they were not confirmed by an “internationally acknowledged” news source. But that kind of verification can be impossible for the personal accounts she is saving, which can pass through closed groups. 

Linda will verify when she can—for instance, she found some posts from an alumni group, and checked all the names to make sure the people actually exist. She’s also suspicious of the many videos of people collapsing on the ground. “I tell people to take these with a grain of salt,” she says, and she tries to be clear that many posts are unconfirmed, asking others to tell her if anything seems questionable. Still, the threat of spreading misinformation is real. So is the threat of the government taking down legitimate posts. 

Tang, meanwhile, doesn’t trust official Chinese media but does trust sources like CNN, BBC, AP, and AFP. Not everybody feels the same way. The volunteer group A2N relies heavily on official news as it collects official reports and scientific information to post to Weibo. Its list of credible sources include hospital reports, People’s Daily, and the business publication Caixin. A2N’s guidelines say that they will only post true information—which they say doesn’t necessarily mean absolutely correct, just credible and traceable. (A2N did not respond to requests for comment.) 

There’s clearly little consensus on what is considered trustworthy news right now, aside from independent foreign media. It’s ironic, then, that while many Westerners are worried about out-of-context messages from Asia, people in mainland China and Hong Kong are trying to fight misinformation by looking to mainstream Western sources. 

For her part, Yaqiu Wang, the Human Rights Watch researcher, says the most helpful thing the Chinese government could do to inspire trust is let independent journalists do their job. That is unlikely to happen, but “when there is no independent media that can independently report, what can you do?” Wang says. “You screenshot things, you do the best you can. You have to get the information."

With this being said, it’s okay for you to order because even if someone coughs to your package the virus will die in the next day or so, when it arrives at your house it’s all good , I’ve been receiving packages and I’m fine.

The first coronavirus death outside China was in the Philippines. It was reported that the infected person was showing signs of improvement before suddenly deteriorating and died. All within 24 hours. Moreover, researcher interpretations based on official data have deduced that even when an infected is in recovering state, the person can still have the viral things in them and they are still capable to infecting people. So even when their body increases in antibodies, the viral virus on the body may not always decrease as typically expected."

When you and the ppl who downvoted me picture a ‘redneck’, would it be accurate to say that you generally picture:

1. A white person

And

2. One who is regional in some way (ie not inner city) ?

Do you ever picture:

A black person

A Japanese person

?


Red neck is old school racism. It’s a group descriptor based on region which is race based and intended in a negative fashion. By the usage here it says ‘they are inferior to me’ which is textbook racism.

It’s perfectly possible to say “the Coronavirus is exposing a lot of inner racism”. That is a true and accurate statement. No need to mention anyone’s neck color."
