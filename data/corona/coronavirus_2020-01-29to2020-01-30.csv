Also arrested were two Chinese “Students” working as research assistants, one of whom was actually a lieutenant in the Chinese Army, the other captured at Logan Airport as he tried to catch a flight to China - smuggling 21 vials of “Sensitive Biological Samples” according to the FBI.

Oh, almost forgot.  The research lab the good professor had helped set up? It’s located at the Wuhan University of Technology.  Wuhan China is ground zero to the potentially global pandemic known as the “Coronavirus”which is both spreading rapidly and killing people.

In fact, given the current statements from experts, I would suggest that a pandemic is not considered to be likely at this time. Most developed countries' health agencies assess the risk to be low at this time. This is partially to avoid panic, since panic leads to starvation of hospital resources for those who actually need it. But the assessments are based on real experiences with previous outbreaks of a similar nature, including SARS and MERS.

A reasonable comparison is the 2003 SARS outbreak. This outbreak was initially out of control, but was stopped in part due to extended school closures in affected states and cities (Beijing, Singapore, etc.) Affected entities this time around are in fact deploying more aggressive containment strategies like the quarantine, but they are not known to be effective (or ineffective), largely because we have no experience with them. However, the tried and true school closures and self-isolation, as well as general good hygiene practices, have been proven to be very effective.

This is not to say that we should not take this seriously. If we don't take the virus seriously, then we will get a pandemic! However, the experts are in a good position to direct the appropriate policy, and they are not forecasting a pandemic at this time, provided that people listen to the suggestions (including handwashing and self-isolation). While some amount of healthy skepticism of the authorities is warranted, I would personally encourage most on this subreddit to keep a more level head and listen to the WHO and CDC instead of trusting everything they read on mainstream and social media.

(As a footnote, I encourage you to read this [The Atlantic](https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2020/01/how-fast-and-far-will-new-coronavirus-spread/605632/) article which has a very good explanation of how [and how not] to interpret the R0 estimates.)"

SIMON ORCHARD
JOURNALIST

35 MINUTES AGO JANUARY 29, 2020

Christmas Island residents are seething after Prime Minister Scott Morrison announced the government would be evacuating Australian’s from China’s coronavirus-plagued Hubei province and quarantining them on the island.

Respected local Islamic community leader, Zainal Majid, said Christmas Island is no place for the deadly disease.

“I’m sure the residents would be concerned,” Mr Majid said. “The island is a pretty small place, “Something that is so negative like this virus… why should the island have to cop it?

“I’ve heard an Australian medical team has managed to replicate the virus, but they haven’t managed to develop a vaccine yet. A vaccine would be better,” he said.

Australian scientists have had a breakthrough in the fight against coronavirus – developing a lab-grown version of the disease – believed to be the first copy of the virus outside of China.

It’s hoped it could help speed up the development of a vaccine to combat the deadly virus.

Mr Majid is currently on holiday in Perth with his family, but with a return flight to the island booked for Tuesday, he said they would have no option but to return home.

“We live there (Christmas Island) so we have no choice. But we don’t want to have this issue with the virus on the island and not controlled,” he added.

Roughly 400 Australians have registered for evacuation from Wuhan as the death rate from the disease continues to climb.

The coronavirus has caused 132 deaths so far, and there are currently 6000 confirmed cases worldwide.

Local business owner Sharon Tisdale has lived on Christmas Island for 13 years and said she was “gobsmacked” when she first heard the news.

“The island is just getting back on its feet, tourism is picking up again, and now we’ve gone from a detention island to a quarantine island,” Ms Tisdale said.

“I think it’s pretty ordinary saying it (the government) wants to protect Australians. Well guess what, the people on Christmas Island are Australian citizens too,” she said.

Ms Tisdale acknowledged Christmas Island seemed like “the convenient option”, but expressed her concern for people on the island, as well as those considering visiting.

“We have so many young children, many recently born children, we have a lot of people with compromised health. What happens to the staff? Are they also quarantined at the centre? Will we be able to fly off the island or are we also a quarantine risk? These are all issues that worry us,” Ms Tisdale said.

“Anyone who speaks about Christmas Island back on the mainland says ‘why would you want to go there, it’s a detention island’. Now we have to deal with this. Who wants to come to a quarantine island?

“You put your trust in the government because you believe they’re doing what’s in Australians’ best interest. That’s gone out the window now,” she said.

Mr Morrison stressed there would be support for Christmas Island residents.

“We will be ensuring there will be support provided directly to the Christmas Island community, completely separate and quarantined from the support that is being provided in the quarantine zone,” Mr Morrison said.

“The defence forces have been tasked to identify overflow facilities where that may be necessary, and also to provide whatever logistical and other support is necessary,” he added.

Evacuees will be quarantined on the island for a fortnight, which is a period in line with medical advice.

Christmas Island, closer to Jakarta than Broome, became an Australian territory in 1958. It currently has a population of around 1800 and covers 135 square kilometres."

The infection has an incubation period of 14 days which means during this period the patient is mostly asymptomatic.

1. They entered during their pre-symptomatic period, hence missed by the screening and developed symptoms after they were in Dubai.

3. They could have entered prior to screening"

Viruses are nothing more than soaps that clean. Viruses are not contagious—they're non-living proteins without a nucleus or respiratory system. They are protein solvents created within red blood cells. When the normal processes of phagocytosis,  (bacterial cleansing), bacterial, fungal, parasitical, are so poisoned to death when they try to consume such toxic tissue, cells conspire to cleanse themselves with non-living proteins (viruses). That is the only way the body can then expel such toxic matter from the body when living microbes are unable to.

China's air is so toxic that there is a constant fog in the air. It is that bad. People breathing this toxicity daily will succumb to the effects and get sick. Viruses help us heal this toxicity.

That case doesn’t sound that concerning to me, fortunately, since he had HIV/his death is not strong evidence if lethality outside of China.

> A 29-year-old man from Yunnan, China, who was under observation in San Lazaro Hospital in Manila for a possible novel coronavirus infection and tested positive for HIV died Wednesday morning due to pneumonia, health officials have confirmed.

> Health officials, however, clarified that the man had not yet tested positive for infection of novel coronavirus, officially known as 2019-nCoV.

> “There is nothing in the preliminary test results that would show that this death is caused by novel coronavirus,” Health Secretary Francisco Duque III said during Question Hour at the House of Representatives Wednesday afternoon.

Regardless, appreciate the information.

Well doc, isn't it good for potential coronavirus carriers to wear them so they contain droplets when they sneeze / cough?  I'd suggest that it's a good idea for pretty much everyone in Wuhan to be wearing them at the moment.

Also, this research from September directly contradicts your statement here:

>For airborne precautions against things like coronavirus (and against things like smoke) you need an N95 mask with a proper seal. Surgical masks like that are to protect against splashes (e.g. splashes from surgery being messy, large droplets from sneezing etc), but don't work as protection against airborne diseases.

Most jobs with high contact (think food service, retail) do not have ""sick days"" and plenty of places will require doctors notes from people who do not have insurance. 

I worked a 12 hour shift with a fever and barking cough because my employer would not send me home. I had extremely bad bronchitis (I went to the hospital after the shift) they gave me a breathing treatment, inhaler, medicine, codene, and a doctor's note. 

But in the scenario it took me peaking a fever and feeling like absolute death before I made the jump to go to the doctor. Despite my obvious infectious risk, my employer would not let me call out. 

Now imagine the scenario with something like the coronavirus. It's a disaster. 

I think the CDC has relied upon info they had at first (low h2h transmission, no asymptomatic carriers, and only Wuhan related cases) and an underestimation of how quickly things can spread here and the reasons behind that. 

Nevermind most people cannot afford to call out for what appears just to be a cold at first. Hell plenty of people won't even call out for the flu if they can stand it."

But viruses typically survive by evolving to defeat the natural (ie, antibodies) or synthetic (ie, antibiotics) defences which humans rely on. It's possible an ancient frozen virus is like a crappy web page... outdated and barely able to function in 2020. Or it could be that it harbours a new style of attack we haven't seen before and so have no defence against. It's all just speculation. 

But the recent Ebola incidents, aswell as the new Coronavirus, show that viruses can spread rapidly and be fatal, but we still have strong measures in place to help prevent them from automatically escalating into a worldwide epidemic which could threaten humanity.

Encore une fois ces chiffres sont à prendre avec des pincettes.

Il n’y a ni traitement ni vaccin actuellement. Par ailleurs, il semble que les personnes infectées soient contagieuses durant la période d’incubation (sans symptômes), du coup elles sont difficiles à identifier et isoler.

The thirty-year-old man, who was one of the first three confirmed coronavirus cases with his partner in France is now hospitalized in intensive care at the Parisian hospital Bichat, at the cutting edge of infectious diseases. ""Her condition has worsened,"" said Agnes Buzyn.

The Minister of Health, straight in a black suit, spoke on Wednesday evening, directly after a meeting at Corruss, the ministry's health crisis center. Balance sheet: the number of individuals infected with the virus whose epicenter is located in Wuhan, is increasing in France. Five people tested positive for the screening test set up by the Pasteur Institute. The last is the daughter of the Chinese tourist, eighty years old and also in intensive care since Monday . This 80-year-old patient arrived in France on January 23, and first consulted the emergency room of the European Georges Pompidou hospital on Saturday 25, where he was not spotted as a carrier of the coronavirus."

And no, I didn't say the N95 masks were useless. I just said that they aren't rated to filter out particles as small as nCoV-2019. You are still better off having something covering your face to protect yourself from bodily fluids (e.g. sneezes/coughs) if you can't avoid being around people. However, it would be a false feeling of security to think that you're fully protected to go around walking in places with a heavy amount of airborne-transmissible pathogens while wearing an N95 mask.

I like the sliding around and stuff. Suits my playstyle. Don't like 5.2 though.

Lots of bad decisions by DICE and not much content. But hey! I spent $60 on this dang game and it gets some content every now and then. I spent $120 for BF1, BF4, and BF3. Can't really complain about the lack of content.

Pretty much only play on certain maps though. Others I avoid like the coronavirus (Fjell, Narvik). I also hate vehicles as well.

I've got like 160 hours in the game. In Phildelphia, an average movie ticket is about $8. Most movies are around 2 hours. The way I see it, I pay $4 to be entertained at a movie meanwhile I've payed $60 to be entertained for 160.

Take a break every now and then. Play other games do other stuff. When BFV lacks in content, I jump ship to Red Dead Online, FFXIV, or ESO. When those games have a content lull, I jump back to BFV. It's no big deal to me."

If you aren't on mobile, there's a facepalm emoji for you. 

It's a designation from WHO. It's to determine how to tackle the virus. If it's declared as a global emergency, it will be tackled with an international effort.
 https://www.cnbc.com/2020/01/22/who-postpones-decision-declaring-china-coronavirus-a-global-health-emergency.html


The current designation is just short of being declared as such. The committee was previously split 50/50 on the decision, but with more local transmissions in WHO countries, this is turning from a Phase 4 into Phase 5. 
So I wouldn't be surprised if they declared it as global emergency in the coming weeks. 

https://www.who.int/csr/disease/swineflu/phase/en/

>At the briefing at WHO headquarters, however, Tedros had [said that the designation could be changed](https://www.sciencealert.com/here-s-why-the-who-hasn-t-declared-the-wuhan-virus-as-a-global-health-emergency) at any moment and that the global risk from the outbreak was ""high"".

>""This is an emergency in China but it has not yet become a global health emergency. It may yet become one,"" he said.

>""WHO's risk assessment is that the outbreak is a very high risk in China, and a high risk regionally and globally.""

>WHO said the categorisation was ""a global evaluation of risk, covering severity, spread and capacity to cope""."

Per WebMD (https://www.webmd.com/lung/coronavirus), often a coronavirus causes upper respiratory infection symptoms like a stuffy nose, cough, and sore throat. You can treat them with rest and over-the-counter medication. The coronavirus can also cause middle ear infections in children.

And according to this NYT op-ed (https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/28/opinion/coronavirus-risk.html) many experts say people in the United States shouldn’t panic. The virus is thought to be less lethal than both SARS and MERS, the last zoonotic coronavirus to infect humans, in 2012. And the vast majority of confirmed cases remain in mainland China, as Catherine Kim reported at Vox.

“Make no mistake, this is an emergency in China. But it has not yet become a global health emergency,” said Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the director general of the World Health Organization.

For perspective: The flu kills roughly 35,000 Americans every year. This season, it has already sickened an estimated 15 million Americans and killed 8,200, according to C.D.C. estimates.

“If Americans aren’t afraid of the flu, perhaps that’s because they are inured to yearly warnings,” Ms. Sabo writes. “For them, the flu is old news. Yet viruses named after foreign places — such as Ebola, Zika and Wuhan — inspire terror.”

The 5576 confirmed cases are just that, confirmed cases - ones that have actually received positive lab results. Most experts put the actual number of infected individuals in the high 10’s of thousands, many of whom probably didn’t even realize that they had any significant illness, as they likely briefly spiked a fever, and that was it.

This doesn’t appear to be a virus that will cause any significant problems for otherwise healthy individuals.

PI Introduction:

Peng Zhou, Ph.D., Researcher, Wuhan Institute of Virology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, and Leader of Bat Virus Infection and Immunization. He received his PhD in Wuhan Virus Research Institute in 2010 and has worked on bat virus and immunology in Australia and Singapore. In 2009 , he took the lead in starting the research on the immune mechanism of bat long-term carrying and transmitting virus in the world. So far, he has published more than 30 SCI articles, including the first and corresponding author's Nature , Cell Host Microbe and PNAS . At present, research on bat virus and immunology is continuing, and it has received support from the National Excellent Youth Fund, the Pilot Project of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, and the Major Project of the Ministry of Science and Technology.

 

The main research directions of the research group:

Taking bats as the research object, I will answer the molecular mechanism that can coexist with Ebola and SARS- associated coronavirus for a long time without causing disease, and its relationship with flight and longevity. Virology, immunology, cell biology, and multiple omics are used to compare the differences between humans and other mammals."

While I don’t know the kits being used for 2019-ncov (my instructions for suspected cases are to send them to my states board of health) I do know my small towns flu numbers. On our highest test day so far this flu season (back in December), we ran 19 flu kits and 9 of those were positive. We still had kits on hand, but we’re running low that day and had to call around to get more. The shortage was getting concerning, so there is almost definitely a bottleneck at the point of care level in China. I suspect we may never know the true number of cases. 

It also depends how they are testing for the virus. If they are doing kit testing then it would be 1 kit:1 suspected case. If they are using serum antigen/antibody testing then potentially 1 set of reagent could test up to hundreds of patients.

The current number of cases do not yet match the flu this season, but the flu season is months in already. Like late October was when it started in my region. We are less than 30 days from the official start of this outbreak. We also don’t know the R0 of this coronavirus reliably because it’s too soon to significantly calculate it. Influenza has an R0 of around 1-2. Estimates for this coronavirus is about 2-3 from the latest calculation I saw (2 days ago)."

> 3、有不少医院反映标本送检后几天没有结果，影响到快速诊断，请问是什么原因？下一步如何提高检测速度？
    答：由于国家已将新型冠状病毒的肺炎纳入乙类传染病，采取甲类管理，对该类病原的样本检测按照高致病性病原微生物（第二类）进行管理，相关样本的检测、运输等必须符合生物安全管理的相关要求，病原相关实验活动应当在具备相应防护级别的生物安全实验室开展。
    前期我们对疑似病例的样本检测流程是这样的：首诊医院通过规范的预检分诊、结合临床检查、实验室检查和胸部影像检查，经专家组会诊后确认疑似病例并采样，由辖区疾控中心将样本转运到市疾控中心，市疾控中心转运到省疾控中心进行核酸检测，每天可检测样本200多份。（1月16日之前我省没有试剂盒，还需要送到国家指定的检测机构进行病毒分离和核酸检测），预计从采样开始到结果返回，当前约需要2天左右的时间（ 1月16日之前，样本需送到北京国家指定的检测机构，结果返回约需要3—5天）。
    为适应当前防控形势需要，提高检测速度，经请示上级有关部门同意，从1月22日昨天开始，我市已指定各定点救治医院、发热定点诊疗医院的对口帮扶医院以及市疾控中心等具备相应防护级别的生物安全实验室开展相关样本的病原核酸检测工作（第一批共10家机构），预计全部运行起来每天可检测样本近2000份。为此，我市计划紧急调运3万人份试剂盒发放到指定检测机构，目前已下发6000人份。

> 3 Many hospitals report that there are no results within a few days after the specimens are submitted for inspection, which affects the rapid diagnosis. What is the reason? How to improve the detection speed next?
Answer: As the country has incorporated pneumonitis of the new type of coronavirus into a Class B infectious disease and adopted Class A management, the detection of samples of this type of pathogen is managed in accordance with highly pathogenic pathogenic microorganisms (Class 2), and the relevant samples are tested and transported. It must meet the relevant requirements of biosafety management, and pathogen-related experimental activities should be carried out in a biosafety laboratory with the corresponding protection level.
In the early stage, the sample detection process for suspected cases was as follows: The first-patient hospital passed a standardized pre-test and triage, combined with clinical examination, laboratory inspection and chest imaging examination, confirmed the suspected case after sampling by the expert group, and sampled the disease. The control center will transfer the samples to the city's disease control center, and the city's disease control center will transfer to the provincial disease control center for nucleic acid detection. More than 200 samples can be detected every day. (Before January 16th, there is no kit in our province, and it needs to be sent to the national designated testing institution for virus isolation and nucleic acid detection.) It is estimated that it will take about 2 days from the start of sampling to the return of results (January 16th) Before, the samples had to be sent to the testing institution designated by the state of Beijing, and the results would take about 3-5 days to return).
In order to meet the needs of the current prevention and control situation and increase the speed of testing, upon requesting the consent of the relevant higher authorities, since January 22, the city has designated various designated treatment hospitals, counterpart assistance hospitals for fever fixed diagnosis and treatment hospitals, and the city's disease control center. Waiting for biosafety laboratories with corresponding protection levels to carry out the detection of pathogenic nucleic acids of related samples (the first batch of a total of 10 institutions), **it is estimated that nearly 2,000 samples can be detected every day when all are run.** To this end, the city plans to urgently transport 30,000 kits to the designated testing institutions, and has so far issued 6,000 copies."

This particular 'coronavirus' strain can have lethal effects on the immunocompromised, elderly, youth and those living with systemic diseases and conditions like coronary heart disease, or diabetes. Sure, it's scary knowing essentially that this virus can be deadly, however it does not present the same level of severity as viruses such as SARS or MERS (which are also closely linked as they are apart of the coronaviruses family.) Keeping good hygiene, washing hands thoroughly and keeping a sanitiser on you is a good idea - for anyone who is worried about this virus, and even in general. In the past week even I came down with a cold. For anyone who is afraid of this virus, if they've had a cold or are feeling sick, please do not worry. The chances you have come in close contact with someone infected are low. Depending where you are, of course. If you are a generally healthy person, the immune system plays a strong defense against diseases, flu's and colds as opposed to those who are immunocompromised etc. It's important to note that with the growing knowledge of this virus, a preventative measure such as a vaccine may be able to prevent this in future, and possibly similar cases. In saying, vaccines are important even if it's just the yearly flu shot, but vaccines don't just come overnight. This virus potentially originated in a wet market, where live and dead animals are sold in close proximity to humans purchasing their own goods (meats). All sorts of wild animals can harbor diseases, specifically bats as they are natural reservoirs of zoonotic diseases which were discovered as hosts for SARS like viruses. Where I live, there would never be such a thing as a 'wet market' with live and dead animals being sold, as it puts the lives of humans in danger due to risk of disease. These wet-markets are often poorly regulated and education to prevent these kind of markets going on around the globe is CRUCIAL. I don't think this will become a 'worldwide pandemic', however, I do believe that there are viruses yet to be discovered, or that already exist and carry a level of lethality. And will at a time emerge or re-emerge into society."

Why would they set up a center next to the original spot if they rerouted? I’m thinking they just didn’t get the update? Or maybe they aren’t actually being rerouted?

> SINGAPORE - Two of Singapore's best-known singers - JJ Lin and Stefanie Sun - have joined hands to write a song encouraging people who have been affected by the Wuhan coronavirus.

> Titled Stay With You, the 3½-minute song is sung by Lin and features a guitar and cello accompaniment. The lyrics include: ""The coldest day will pass/I'll stay with you/Waiting for the sunrise."" It is mostly in Mandarin, with the music composed by Lin and lyrics written by Sun.

> A video accompanying the song, featuring images of frontline workers, lit candles and fireworks over Marina Bay, was uploaded onto the two stars' Instagram accounts on Tuesday (Jan 28). The video ended with the message: ""There is no imprisoned city, only a love that does not leave.""

> Lin's post was captioned: ""No matter the challenge, love will always prevail.""

> Sun also shared in her post that Lin contacted her a few days ago, wanting to write a song to pay tribute to all the frontline staff working during the outbreak.

> In the post, she wrote: ""Stay With You is from our hearts. Thank you for all the hard work.""

> This is not the first time Lin has tried to lift the spirits of listeners through music. In the wake of the 2008 Sichuan Earthquake in China, he wrote the melody of the song Love And Hope to comfort those who had been affected by the disaster.

 The n95 is for preventing the wearer from contracting truly airborne diseases like TB or shingles because if filters all air going in.

Though she exhibits fatigue and cold-like symptoms, she dismisses it like jet lag. Within 24 hours, she's dead, alongside her young son. Her husband, played by Matt Damon, is somehow immune and survives.

Thus begins the Stephen Soderberg's 2011 movie *Contagion*. Over the next hour and 46 minutes, the movie tracks what happens when a deadly China-born virus goes global and leads to mass chaos as epidemiologists race to find a vaccine.

On Tuesday, the thriller rocketed to No. 10 movie rental chart on iTunes, where it shares space with such of-the-moment titles as *Joker* (No. 1), *Once Upon a Time in Hollywood* (No. 3), *Parasite* (No. 4), and *Hustlers* (No. 8).

It's a rare feat and one that surely owes its climb to the current coronavirus outbreak in China.

According to the latest reports, the coronavirus has killed more than 100 people and is believed to have originated in Wuhan, China, with more than 4,500 cases confirmed as of Tuesday, reports *The New York Times*. Airports across the United States have expanded screenings and are testing passengers flying in from that part of the world.

No, you wouldn't do a full on test (due to the good points you've made). The purpose would be to flag the passenger, note their name and details, etc. Maybe considering asking where they will be going/staying. Provide them with an instructions sheet on who to call and what to do if symptoms get worse (in multiple languages). 

>Diagnostic health screening is a pretty complicated science and tbh I trust Canadian Health authorities. 

I would generally trust them, but immigration/security/etc I don't trust to have the resources or capability to do whats best.

The passenger that was showing symptoms, and did self-report coming from a problem area was told to go home. Imagine if there was any sort of language barrier or confusion and they didn't call in and self-quarantine?"

Another aspect of the Wuhan quarantine has been its hasty nature. Even now, after several days of quarantine, no specific plan has been issued, suggesting no preparations were made at all before the announcement. What should be done to settle or assist the estimated one million refugees from Wuhan who made it out before the quarantine was implemented? During the quarantine period, how would food, water and other basic necessities be provided to residents of the city? How would medical personnel at hospitals and clinics be provided with the medicines and other essentials? How would the authorities deal with urgent transportation needs, such as medical staff getting to and from work and patients getting to hospitals for medical treatment? How would law and order be maintained? The government has so far offered no explanation for how these and many other urgent questions are being dealt with.
 
In the absence of answers, what we have is the shutting off and shutting down of a city, plain and simple. A quarantine that means 11 million people are trapped within their city. No one seems to have considered how public order will be maintained, and how our lives here in Wuhan will be supported.
 
This is the situation in Wuhan, Hubei’s capital city. We can suppose that the situation is no better, and is possibly worse, in the other cities that have similarly come under quarantine. Of the fourteen cities under facing lockdown, there are so far no exceptions in terms of the announcement of plans or preparations. They are equally in the dark, having become fourteen isolated islands, home to an estimated 35 million helpless citizens.
 
The results of this are already becoming clear. First, we are seeing a shortage of supplies of essential household goods in Wuhan, and inflation is out of control. The city was closed off early in the morning on January 23, and by noon the price of vegetables had already skyrocketed, some vegetables priced up to hundreds of yuan per half-kilo. By afternoon that same day, many supermarkets in the city had been entirely cleaned out. Fortunately, this is perhaps the one time during the year, with the arrival of the Spring Festival, that Chinese families tend to have reserve supplies at home to prepare for festivities. But if fresh supplies are not made available soon, it’s possible many families will not have enough to eat.
 
Another major problem right now is that major hospitals and frontline medical staff do not have sufficient supplies of protective equipment as they work overtime to treat a flood of patients. Even the best hospitals in Hubei, such as Tongji Hospital and Xiehe Hospital, cannot escape this basic problem. They have reported that even masks are in short supply.
 
In some cases, frontline medical personnel were unable to eat their New Year’s Eve meals last Friday, one of the most important meals of the year. This was not because there was no food to eat, but because their protective masks are single-use, and must be changed out any time they are removed, lest they become ineffective. But there were already an insufficient number of masks by the weekend, and so medical personnel didn’t dare remove them. More serious even than the shortage of protective equipment is the fact that many frontline medical personnel are exhausted and on the verge of collapse due to extreme mental and physical strain.
 
Another issue that has so far not been addressed is the fact that there are roughly one million Wuhan residents who managed to leave the city and who are now essentially refugees without any proper means of finding shelter or care, and who risk being chased down and harassed by local governments and communities out of fear. In some cases, they may present a real risk in spreading the virus. In other cases, they may face brutal treatment as refugees and outcasts.  
 
Wuhan under quarantine has already begun to feel like a ghost city. From New Year’s Eve into New Year’s Day, you couldn’t hear a single firecracker going off. I have lived in this city for decades already, and this is the first time that the Chinese New Year has passed without the sound of fireworks. The entire city is silent. The traffic lanes, usually jammed with vehicles, are empty. All public places are now inaccessible. No one is associating or organizing get togethers. There is no sense of community. No public life. We are all atomized individuals, living in isolation in our own homes, passing the time watching the television, or glued to our mobiles.
 
In this dead silence, fear spreads. Senior government officials are certainly living in fear. And just how afraid are they? After announcing the closure of the city, they failed to present contingency plans of any kind; and they have failed since to offer up any plans for future action. At a crucial point last Friday, on the eve of the New Year, none of them dared stand with front-line medical personnel in Hubei’s hospitals, or to offer them meals or encouragement of any kind.  
 
They can’t possibly be ignorant of the fact that such signs of leadership are the only way they can offer a thread of confidence to those on the front lines, and to the millions who are trapped in this sad city. And yet, they somehow find it impossible to take such steps. They appear not to have the courage.
 
And there may be a reason for this. Why? Because there are already concrete examples that deepen their sense of dread. On January 22, Huang Mouhong (黄谋宏), the deputy director of the Hubei Provincial Department of Commerce, was diagnosed with the coronavirus. Before this, there was news that Wang Guangfa, the expert who had flown to Wuhan from Beijing and announced that the disease was “preventable and controllable,” had been confirmed as infected shortly after his return to the capital.
 
In fact, both the provincial and municipal governments have already effectively been shut down, and to a large extent can be said to now be only caretaker governments (看守政府). These cowardly and incompetent governments obviously cannot take on the necessary responsibility of governing in what has already become essentially a state of war. This leaves the public in a state of deep concern and uncertainty.
 
On January 22, Zhang Ouya (张欧亚), a journalist for the official Hubei Daily newspaper, clearly at the end of his rope, fairly shouted online: “Wuhan must immediately change out its commanders” (武汉必须当机立断换帅了). For a brief time, this furious call proliferated online. Another meme was rapidly born, like a mutating virus, across social media. The word “coronavirus”, or guānzhuàng bìngdú (冠状病毒), was replaced with the identical-sounding “official virus” (官状病毒), mocking the cowardice and ineffectiveness of the government and of high-level officials.
 
We may find it hard to suppress a bitter laugh over such an acts of inventive criticism. But such a story cannot have a happy ending in China’s stability-obsessed political environment – where anything can be stopped. Zhang Ouya’s post was quickly expunged. The Party leadership of the Hubei Daily Media Group, Zhang’s employer, wrote a letter of apology to the Municipal Party Committee expressing its “deepest apologies” for Zhang Ouya’s “incorrect remarks.” The group also made clear that it was starting “relevant procedures” to hold Zhang accountable.
 
At the same time, while carrying on an investigation of Wuhan’s Huanan Seafood Market, where the outbreak originated, Xiao Hui (萧辉), a reporter for Caixin Media, was surrounded and beaten by four security guards. Caixin journalist Wang Heyan (王和岩), one of the finest investigative reporters working in China today, contacted several doctors in Wuhan in order to verify infections among medical staff, but was not allowed to meet with her sources. The Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention has issued an order saying that: “[Medical personnel must not, under any condition, accept media interviews, and must not leak information about the outbreak to the outside. Noone can accept interviews, even if journalists promise anonymity and agree to protect their sources.”
 
What will tomorrow bring? Here in Wuhan, 11 million of us are waiting — not for dramatic action, but for openness and a real plan of action.

Gangnam Plastic Surgery sparks through South Korea's third 'Wuhan pneumonia' confirmer  


As the fourth confirmed patient of 'Wuhan Pneumonia', a new coronavirus infection in Korea, was confirmed, the path of the third confirmed patient who was confirmed on 26th was spotted.  


On March 27, the Center for Disease Control and Prevention said that a 55-year-old Korean man who returned to China on December 20 from Wuhan City, Hubei Province, was confirmed for the fourth time as a new type of coronavirus infection.  


In particular, the third confirmed patient (a 54-year-old male, Korean) was moved to Gangnam and Ilsan, and was contacted with a total of 74 people.  


According to the third checker's movement route released by the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Mr. A used a personal car on 22nd, and accompanied him to a doctor who was treated at Globy Plastic Surgery in Gangnam-gu, Seoul around 1 pm, and then visited a nearby restaurant. After using it, I stayed at a hotel in Gangnam-gu, Seoul.  


After lunch on the 23rd, I went for a walk on the Han River and went to a convenience store along the Han River (GS Han River Jamwon No. 1), and then went to restaurants around Yeoksam-dong and Daechi-dong in Gangnam-gu.  


At lunch on the 24th, I went back to the acquaintances of Globy Plastic Surgery Clinic. In the afternoon, I visited a restaurant and cafe in Ilsan and stayed at Ilsan's mother's house in the evening.  


On the 25th, he did not go out from his mother's home in Ilsan and reported it to 1339.  


The fourth confirmed patient visited a domestic medical institution due to cold symptoms on the 21st, and a high fever (38 degrees) and myalgia occurred on the 25th.  


On May 26, muscle aggravation worsened, he was diagnosed with pneumonia at a health screening clinic and classified as a suspected case.  


On the same day, they were quarantined as a nationally designated hospital treatment hospital (Seoul National University Hospital), and the next day, the test was confirmed as a new coronavirus infection.  


The Centers for Disease Control is currently conducting in-depth epidemiological investigations along patients' movements.  


An official at the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said, ""All medical institutions and hotels visited by the third sponsor completed environmental disinfection.""  


When the movement was made public, people went around a lot. ""Would people who came from Wuhan have to check and quarantine unconditionally? What is it?"" ""Global Plastic Surgery, nurses, The families ... exponentially exposed to the threat of transmission, which is a catastrophic disaster. """

>**4. Masks are useless when worn outdoors and may not be very helpful even indoors.**  Most masks deteriorate after one or two wearings. Using the same mask  day after day is worse than useless—it’s disgusting, as the contents of  your mouth and nose eventually coat the inside of the mask with a smelly  veneer that is attractive to bacteria. I rarely wear a face mask in an  epidemic, and I have been in more than 30 outbreaks. Instead, I stay  away from crowds, and I keep my distance from individual people—a half  meter, about 1.5 feet, is a good standard. If someone is coughing or  sneezing, I ask them to put on a mask—to protect me from their  potentially contaminated fluids. If they decline, I step a meter (about 3  feet) away from them, or I leave. Don’t shake hands or hug  people—politely beg off, saying it’s better for both of you not to come  in close contact during an epidemic."

Now to address your argument in more depth. Click that Lancelet link in my post, and jump to the paragraph just above discusion. This study looked at 41 patients over a long period of time, and is perhaps the most important study available for gauging the virus’s capabilities. Of the 41, 6 died (15%) and 28 (68%) have been discharged. They aren’t technically fully recovered, but their symptoms are improving rapidly and they look like they’ll be fine. 7 (17%) are still under care due to severe symptoms. Maybe one or two more die, but the rest will probably pull through. An average of 20% having extreme entended symptoms was reported by the WHO.

This would give you about a 15% mortality rate, which is pretty damn bad but is effected by the sample size and certain extenuating circumstances. The reason recovered is so low is because China has to prove that they a patient who had the Coronavirus instead of a normal flu and that they have completely recovered instead of it improving for a bit just to suddenly get worse again. This takes a lot of resources and time, and hospitals are being flooded. In the long run, we can expect numbers to be around what the Lancelet report suggests. Something important to consider is poor air quality in China and their habit for smoking making them much more vulnerable to lung diseases such as this."

They love reminding us the Flu is more deadly (which it is currently). No denying that at the moment. The Flu is always here. Has been around for a millennial. Even with the minimally effective vaccine.

What they don’t broadcast often is that the current Flu is mostly targeting young adults and children and that the current Flu vaccine is only about 40% to 60% effective. 

But if you do get the flu despite having gotten the vaccine, studies show that severe illness, hospitalization, ICU admission, and death are less likely to occur. And it’s not to late to get a Flu Shot.

No vaccine for this Coronavirus currently. They do admit that they dealing with a serious and novel pathogen. But don’t panic."

The aircraft definitely could have hit on its side. We may find out more later if they release more after the investigation. It’s possible that some parts are still whole after a crash also. I’ve known helicopters that have crashed and had entire parts that weren’t burnt up in the crash. For example, we had a helicopter make a drastic maneuver to miss a mountain, just to inadvertently fly almost straight into the ground. It killed lots of the people on board but there were plenty of parts that were still whole. 

Don’t go too far down the rabbit hole though as far as conspiracies. I browse the conspiracy sub sometimes and some people seem to actually think the crash was on purpose to distract from the impeachment or the coronavirus haha

You are a shopkeeper. You have stock of 100 masks which you bought from the supplier for $1 each. You plan to sell them for $2, allowing you to both replace stock, and make a profit. 

Bam. Coronavirus. 

Scenario 1
1. You see a massive increase in demand. If you sell all of your masks you can restock with 200 masks, but make no profit. 

2. You know these 200 masks will quickly sell out given demand. So you decide to increase your selling price to $8. A 4x increase. 

3. You sell all the masks at this price. You can buy 800 more masks, which now matches demand. 

4. The matched demand means you no longer need to increase your stock level, so you can lower your price back to $2, or to a figure which reflects any changes in supplier costs, and still make your original profit margin, whilst maintaining higher supply. 

Note that the increased demand necessitated a price increase to increase stock levels. Effectively, the rich who can afford a higher price initially have subsidised the masks for the poor. More poor, get more masks, as quickly as the supply chain allows. 

Scenario 2
1. Your shop next door is that in scenario 1. He gets fined for increasing his pricing and is forced to close. 

2. You fear increasing your prices, a fine will destroy your business. You only increase your prices to $3. 

3. Meanwhile, the wholesale cost of masks has risen to $3. Your supplier is under the same cash flow pressures as shopkeeper 1. 

4. You can now only afford to restock with 100 masks, but can no longer sell them at a profit without increasing your prices again. 

5. Hesitant to do so, for fear of fines, you either stop selling masks, or increase by a small amount again.

Note that the second shopkeeper now has only sold 200 masks, and because prices are lower, they will have been bulk bought in panick by fewer customers. The penetration of life saving masks to the public is hampered. 

Scenario 3
1. You are shop 2.  Your shopkeeper friend in shop 1 was not fined. 

2. Instead, you also increase prices, but only to $7 on an attempt to undercut him and sell your masks more quickly. Allowing you to restock more quickly.

Note that here, both shops have drastically increased their supply of life saving masks.

About imunity in general... Not really. There are usually relatively immunity system differences amongst human population, but I am not that well versed in immunogenetics.

However, it is widely studied that Western based Diet high in fat and sugar plus low in fiber are actually very bad for immune system because of its inherent proinflammatory features. Basically, the usual Western Diet is bad for your body.

For comparison: the European mostly follow Mediterranean diet with lots of fish and vegetables, so they are relatively healthier than usual American.

Also because of rampant obesity, diabetes, and hypertension amongst Westerner, we could expect their immune system to be at the very least compromised to some degree.

So, in a figure of speech, an average Indonesian eating usual Indonesian diet (little meat, lots of rice, more fibers) in Indonesian environment would fare better than an usual obese American eating Western Diets (lots of fat lots of sugar) in Indonesian environment (which the westerner body's has no idea how to deal with it).

In response to the coronavirus epidemic,

China has:

-begun construction on two 1,000 bed

hospitals, to be completed w/in two weeks

-isolated & sequenced the virus genome &

made that info public

-begun developing a vaccine

Could the US have mobilized its resources

in such a way?

Viruses typically need ""a host"".
The new Coronavirus (Corona is basically a collection of multiple viruses), seemingly doesn't transmit over surfaces at all. Only by close proximity of people. More noteworthy, saliva.
So if you hear someone sneeze or cough, run away. Sneezing and coughing generally only spread in close proximity due to gravity. The tiny drops of saliva will hit the ground fairly fast.
And oh. Don't make out with random strangers from the bar, unless you feel comfortable doing that with a faceshield.. 😂

In any case, it doesn't hurt being cautious. Even if they haven't seen any spread through surfaces&objects so far, it doesn't mean that it's impossible. Viruses do mutate from time to time.

I'd say, look where in China it ships from and then calculate your own risk.
Especially if it's close to a region with outbreaks.. maybe it's worth buying ""at home"" or from a European/american country."

Taiwan doesn’t have a lot of Mask making factory, China does.

China is Taiwan’s largest face mask exporter.

China has enormous need of mask since the Novel Coronavirus outbreak, any masks they make will be given priority to the affected outbreak area. Hence, the export of masks to Taiwan will decrease significantly.

Taiwan, to ensure self sufficient face mask, decided to stop export of masks to all country for a month.

But these people, don’t they realize that Coronavirus isn’t exactly new? 

My cats have the corona virus. Or well they have *a* corona virus, a feline form. One that affects cats by upsetting their stomach, usually not very serious, and which  is very, very common (spreads very easily) and have been around for a really long time. Don’t know how long but long enough for there to be a lot of studies and knowledge about it. 

It’s no biggie with the virus it self, as I said they get an upset stomach but very rarely more than a few days of diarrhea and it heals out by it self. There are only two worries, if you have many cats they can just keep pass it around and infect each other which can obviously become an issue. But the other one is worse. It can mutate, and when it does they get FIP. It can’t be predicted or prevented nor can it be treated once it mutates, if it does. FIP is a death sentence. They will die and they will die painfully, and there is nothing you can do about it. 

Our cats have had it for at least 5 years or so. Possibly longer. But that’s when we found out."

Some 1.9 million people are now considered illegal immigrants there - about half muslim and half hindu. BJP was an avid supporter of NRC until the final list came out and then rejected the final list overnight alleging NRC was unfair to genuine citizens.

You can pretend to take rightwing extremist stances about these Assamese illegals, and see their reactions. Suggest things like packing them all on ships and floating them away into the ocean to their fates, or send all of them into bangladesh or, finish them off with coronavirus (that one was an actual suggestion in a rightwing sub!). If they are genuinely kind people, they will be horrified. If they are kind but bothered only by illegal immigration not religion, they may agree only to the bangladesh return and none of the other ideas. If they are religious bigots, they may agree with extremist solutions for muslims but suggest some way to bail out hindu illegals. In any case, you'll have learnt a lot more about what they think. 

This also gives an insight into how the party and its government can carry out a massive atrocity without making its supporters feel like it's an atrocity - they just have to rig the system to label large sections of poor Indian muslims who fail the test as doubtful voters without voting rights and finally outright ""illegals"". If they are ""illegals"", they don't have human rights seems to be the trending thought in rightwing circles, and this can be easily probed. It'll happen over a number of years - maybe 6-8 years - to avoid any kind of alarm over the numbers. The principle of slowly boiling the frog.  Actual numbers will never be known since RTI has been weakened. The Assam NRC is a very good template actually for how everything will get panned out."

Does it seem reasonable that china would suddenly  lock down 56 million people, cancel their nations biggest holiday, and  commit near economic suicide over 30 deaths when thats not even a drop  in the bucket of people dying of basically the same cause of death, even  if the viral agent was different?

It can be prevented.  Many [unsung heros](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2017/11/10/russian-spies-must-save-world-warns-former-british-double-agent/) have intervened at the final moment to save us.  Just to take one example, [Kim Philby](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jan/31/kim-philby-tipped-off-ussr-as-fbi-closed-in-on-nuclear-physicist-bruno-pontecorvo) tipped off Stalin that nuclear bombers were in the air heading for Moscow and Stalin quickly lifted the Berlin blockade.  The bombers had to turn back and the world was saved from a nuclear catastrophe.  We need people like that in the alphabet soup organisations to step forward as lone wolves soon.  They [are there](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Shadow_Brokers) and in place, but no one can take them for granted.     

>And if so when youd think itll happen.

No one knows.  

>With all that info on the coronavirus I think that you know some thing about this

The info is not really buried very deep.  A Google search will dredge up most of it.  They trust you won't look and if you do they trust you will be willfully blind and go and join XR, because that's easier than looking behind the curtain.  Liberals self-police and censor themselves because it's so much nicer to go on your clucking way than admit to yourself [we live in a pie factory](https://youtu.be/ZUdew5gMbTg).  Atm, XR is basically a campaign to save the pie factory.  But hopefully they will learn soon."

The virus was released near a disease research center in China to make it look like it was accidentally released.

The next step would be for America to cease all flights into and out of China, and to encourage all other countries to do the same, out of concern for containing the spread of the virus.

The next step after that would be for America to cease all imports from China under the guise of concern that the virus can spread through physical goods, and to encourage all other countries to do the same.

While that's going on, a propaganda campaign on western social media spreads the rumor that Chinese weapons researchers accidentally released the virus.  

A simultaneous propaganda campaign is conducted on Chinese social media to spread the same rumor, with the goal of sowing distrust among the Chinese people towards the Chinese government.  Early reports of state-owned media downplaying the outbreak is portrayed as evidence of guilt, as is all current and future denials of the rumor.

Use the same dissident front groups currently hired to destabilize/undermine China  by spreading the propaganda on social media about Hong Kong, the Uighurs, Tibet, etc.  (the Falon Hong/Epoch Times)

at least a mask can help u unknowingly touching your face. or can use hand sanitizer to keep your hand clean and unknowingly spread diseases

most of the decisions made seem reactive rather than proactive. take so long to ban ppl from wuhan and its province. even hk took faster decisions regarding students coming back from china. 

seeing all the long Qs for buying masks. dont even seem there were lessons learnt from the haze a few years ago. much less sars almost 2 decade ago.

all better do your part in being clean. so many ppl coughing openly in public. knn. even the supermarket staff at self checkout was coughing. if she got virus. dunno how many she would infect. if others got virus dunno how many others will kena also. dont think those screens at self checkout are cleaned often. other public places also. the escalator handrails where you hold onto at mrt stations is so filthy. even half empty neighbourhood malls have cleaner escalators. i thought it was at least cleaned in the morning but recently took the escalator in the morning. early morning also dirty. dunno if its ever cleaned.

The eyes are very easy entry point for viruses. The skin is actually a pretty good barrier for a lot of things (within reason), and the mouth is an easy point as well, but unless you're wearing at least a P95 it doesn't do what most people think. Surgical masks are more for protecting others against particulates. Surgical masks offer some protection against infection, but not very much. Also, surgical masks end up being fairly useless anyway for most people, because they're not strict about their hygiene standards. They'll touch their mask or their mouth with their hands, for example. 

Most of us don't think about eyes. There was even a case recently where a medic in China became infected with coronavirus because he wasn't wearing goggles. Glasses are good because they're essentially a ""grey man"" PPE. They serve 1) a physical barrier against particulate matter, which is how the virus spreads, and 2) they serve as a reminder to not rub my eyes. 

I have been making regular use of hand sanitizer, and carry a mask and gloves in my backpack in case I get stuck somewhere with lots of people. The subway has been having some problems lately, so sometimes thousands of people get jam packed together underground, which is one example scenario.

TL;DR -- DEFINITELY RAMBLING, but glasses = effective grey man PPE."

Recently, the Center for Health Security has received questions about whether that pandemic exercise predicted the current novel coronavirus outbreak in China. To be clear, the Center for Health Security and partners did not make a prediction during our tabletop exercise. For the scenario, we modeled a fictional coronavirus pandemic, but we explicitly stated that it was not a prediction. Instead, the exercise served to highlight preparedness and response challenges that would likely arise in a very severe pandemic. We are not now predicting that the nCoV-2019 outbreak will kill 65 million people. Although our tabletop exercise included a mock novel coronavirus, the inputs we used for modeling the potential impact of that fictional virus are not similar to nCoV-2019.

Do you know what the ratings mean? 

The “N” stands for the not resistant to oil, of course, and “P” is for ""oil proof,"" and can help you remember that only masks with a “P” rating can provide ample protection against oil-based particulates.  It is helpful to note that since government agencies determine these ratings, one N95 mask that is more expensive than another will not provide some kind of “better” N95 protection

And the number is the % of particles it will filter out.


Every dust mask sold in the USA as protective equipment must have a NIOSH rating. 

N95 or p95 masks if they are worn correctly are more effective than a surgical mask.

Masks are a placebo unless you are in a high risk area.  

Most people are not wearing them correctly or using ones that fit anyway.

If you really wanted to be protected you need a mask that fits you, you should wear it all the time you, you should also be wearing eye protection ( they eyes are a potential point of entry), decontaminating your environment, clothing, hands, ect, and avoid crowds and public areas."

What I mean is, it takes time for pneumonia and ARDS to wear a body down enough to cause death. In the meantime, the virus is spreading rapidly, infecting many people and inflating that number by 30% overnight. So the death rate is deceptively low because your equation is this:

people who have died from Wuhan coronavirus/people who have been infected by Wuhan coronavirus= death rate

But the bottom number will increase at a faster rate than the top number, which makes this equation wrong."

The seasonal flu virus is well researched; the Coronavirus is not. The seasonal flu has existed in China before 2019-2020, but for some reason, the authorities in China feel compelled to quarantine 15 cities and build 2 hospitals in Wuhan in 6 days. Whether or not this materializes, there's no reason why you can't plan to make travel plans (within the city of Buffalo and outside of it) a little more calculated.

How people choose to narrate the sub context of the picture is entirely up to them. But it's not the 'mature' thing to do to demand an apology for this.

O feito pode ajudar a acelerar a criação de uma vacina contra a infecção.

 Os pesquisadores do Instituto Peter Doherty de Infecção e Imunidade em Melbourne disseram que vão compartilhar a amostra, desenvolvida a partir da coleta de um paciente infectado, com a OMS (Organização Mundial da Saúde) e laboratórios ao redor do mundo.

 Um laboratório na China já tinha conseguido recriar o vírus com sucesso, mas divulgou apenas a sequência do genoma, e não a amostra em si.

 Com a criação e o compartilhamento do vírus, vacinas e medicamentos podem ser testados em animais infectados. 

 ""Mais pessoas podem fazer a cultura do vírus, usar a informação para desenvolver medicamentos, vacinas e melhor caracterizar a natureza desse coronavírus e sua transmissão"", disse Raina MacIntyre, que dirige o programa de pesquisas em biosegurança do Instituto Kirby.

 A amostra também poderia ser usada para gerar um teste de anticorpos que permitiria a detecção do vírus em pacientes infectados que não têm sintomas, segundo o Instituto Peter Doherty.

  ""Ter o vírus de verdade significa que agora temos a habilidade de validar e verificar todos os métodos de testes"", disse Julian Druce, diretor do laboratório de identificação de vírus do instituto.

GENEVA (Reuters) - The World Health Organization (WHO) is “very impressed” with the Chinese response to the global coronavirus outbreak so far, a senior official said on Wednesday, adding that the world had reached a critical point in efforts to tackle the disease.

“They are taking extraordinary measures in the face of what is an extraordinary challenge,” said Mike Ryan, Executive Director of WHO Health Emergencies Programme who accompanied the body’s chief on a trip to China this week.

“We are at an important juncture in this event. We believe these chains of transmission can still be interrupted.”"

In the attempt to paint an obviously ridiculous statement they added ""24/7"", implying that it mirrors the sentiment of people worrying about the coronavirus. One would obviously say that they don't worry ""24/7"" and in turn, the reader supposed to connect that to the coronavirus.

However, don't get distracted by the demagogy. Most people absolutely worry about their children and elderly getting sick. People that are parents right now worry about the health of their child and their parents worried, generally, over their health when they were young. My mother cares for her mothers health and I care for my mother's health.

You see my parents live in German, but they planned to visit my grandmother in their homeland of Vietnam next week.

I do not worry ""24/7"", but I do worry."

Saves you a lot of time swapping builds around. The only frames I :might: suggest buying after you get a bunch of slots are Harrow or Nidus. Khora is pretty rough, too, but if you use sanctuary onslaught to level gear you'll eventually get her just leveling. Their grind is notoriously bad, but again, the cost is very high compared to what you get/save. Don't bother using plat to trade for mods or augments, unless it's specifically adaptation. That's the only mod worth getting that's locked behind a huge time investment since you have to complete the starchart to get it.

All in all, I'd recommend buying 10-20 warframe slots, 40~ weapon slots, maybe 5 loadout slots, then hold the rest for future use. Oh, and upgrade your incubator (if that's still an option?) That'll let you swap pets around instantly rather than wait for stasis to wear off. 

Also, avoid trade chat like the Coronavirus. Use warframe market to price anything your contemplating buying."

This can include the place of treatment not even acknowledging a person is being treated or is even present at a healthcare facility. I don’t know if any of those laws get bent in pandemic situations. 

Also, quarantine is the first step...they are being quarantined. It makes sense the US wants their citizens on their soil so they can be monitored “in house.” We could glean a lot more info that way, and besides it’s super cold in Ontario anyway. 

The second step— if any peeps are positive for Coronavirus— would be, at best, further isolation and fluid resuscitation. There are currently no other [proven effective] treatment options that I’m aware of, besides life support if they go into ARDS or MSOF. So basically, all that needs and has to be done is being done and done discreetly to help promote calm.

It is devastating for some people to “not know.” I am one of those people. I’ve seen every propaganda video China has put out, but also every stray video showing healthcare workers struggling to keep working under the worst of conditions with little to no resources. (People laying dead, convulsing, waiting in long lines). 

I think the WHO conference video released this a.m. shows China is trying and more determined than ever to get things back under control. They don’t have a choice but to share info and accept help, or things will spiral out of control in Wuhan and the other provinces. 

Does that mean every person working at a high level made perfect decisions through this pandemic? No. But all nations seem to be on the same page and willing to work together to implement strategies to contain the virus. Everyone is doing their best."

The mother, 32, and daughter, four, came back from China on Monday morning after visiting Zhengzhou for Chinese New Year.

They cut short their holiday following concerns over the spread of the coronavirus.

At around 5am today, a family source said the mother – who had been suffering from flu like symptoms – woke up struggling to breathe.

She was then taken, alongside her daughter, by police escort for testing.

The father, who is showing no symptoms, has been placed under house quarantine.

The Argus have agreed not to identify the family source, father, mother and daughter.

Tests are ongoing and no results have yet been confirmed.

The family had self-quarantined themselves following their return and had tried to avoid public spaces as a precautionary measure.

A spokeswoman for Public Health Wales would only say that there are no confirmed cases of coronavirus in Wales.

“For reasons of patient confidentiality, Public Health Wales is not able to comment on individual cases. There are currently no confirmed cases of novel coronavirus in Wales or in the rest of the UK, and the risk to the UK is low,"" she said."

"" ...new coronavirus infections start off much like many other less dangerous diseases. Initial symptoms are fever, dry cough, myalgia (muscle pain), and fatigue. Productive cough (a cough that produces phlegm) and headache are infrequent, hemoptysis (coughing up blood) and diarrhea occasional. It can take about a week before an infected person feels sick enough to seek medical care.

After this deceptively slow start, the disease progresses rapidly during the second week—in a similar fashion to SARS. Hypoxemia caused by increasing lung injury leads to difficulty breathing and the need for oxygen therapy. ARDS (acute respiratory distress syndrome) is a common complication. Between 25 and 32 percent of cases are admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) for mechanical ventilation and sometimes ECMO (pumping blood through an artificial lung for oxygenation)."""

I only claim what there is evidence for, nothing more, nothing less. For example, I never said anything about a deliberate infection by the Chinese government, did I?  
  
Let's look at the evidence then. Merely a few days ago, a bat SARS-like coronavirus could be seen in US National Library of Medicine and its envelope protein was [100% identical](https://ncbiinsights.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/2020/01/13/novel-coronavirus/) to the current Wuhan coronavirus. The link is now gone and can only be seen through archives. Interesting, isn't it?  
  
[An article from 2015 was made about the study of this virus](https://www.the-scientist.com/news-opinion/lab-made-coronavirus-triggers-debate-34502). The purpose of the lab test was to manipulate a bat coronavirus to see if it could infect humans. It was discovered that it could.  
  
[It is irrefutable that it was a designer virus](https://web.archive.org/web/20200127221021/https://patents.justia.com/patent/10130701) as it was PATENTED.  
  
Another interesting thing is the [publicly released genome of the Wuhan virus](https://ncbiinsights.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/2020/01/13/novel-coronavirus/), which show it's familial relation to the other ""bat SARS-like coronavirus"".  
  
One of the people who co-wrote the paper on this virus was a Chinese researcher by the name of Xing-Ye Gi. Google scholar shows Gi has written or co-written numerous papers on SARS, ebola and coronavirus.  
  
[Quick search on him here to prove it.](https://scholar.google.co.uk/scholar?as_q=&num=10&btnG=Search+Scholar&as_epq=&as_oq=&as_eq=&as_occt=any&as_sauthors=%22Xing-Yi+Ge%22&as_publication=&as_ylo=&as_yhi=&as_allsubj=all&hl=en)  
  
Gi also coincidentally works in Wuhan at Key Laboratory of Special Pathogens and Biosafety of Wuhan Institute of Virology.  
  
That's a lot of coincidences, but I won't fill in the gaps with what I don't know. I do know that experts in the field are slowly saying what it hints at."

The flu kills a lot of people every year. This has more to do with fear of the unknown. With the flu, it’s expected, it happens every year, we already have vaccines that mitigate the issue. 

There are two main concerns with this virus that make it different. 

First, we do not have a vaccine. That means everyone is susceptible, as far as we know. Imagine if the flu happened for the first time and no one was vaccinated against its spread. In 2012 the vaccine had an estimated efficacy of 67%. 45% of the population was vaccinated in 2012. Flu related deaths from 2010 to 2016 were 12k to 56k. So about half the people someone with the flu virus encountered were vaccinated and 2/3 of those people would have been protected (I think that’s how it would work?). With coronavirus, every single person that comes into contact with the virus could potentially get infected. That means it will spread more easily. 

Second, the incubation period from infection to showing symptoms is anywhere from a week to two weeks. It appears that the virus is contagious before symptoms show (not sure what the specific timeline is).  That means infected individuals will be in public with freedom of mobility and the potential to travel long distances before any precautions are taken. 

As it stands, it is currently a big question mark. It’s an emergency in China and a serious concern elsewhere. It’s not necessarily worse than the flu, but because of the above two points has the potential to spread more easily and infect more people."

I am no expert and I am not responsible for your results but theoretically you could keep the masks at 56 degrees C for half hour or one hour. That should remove coronavirus, not other pathogens.

If you have a choice you should use a new one, always.

Boiling them is a bad idea. Some have exhaust valves made out of plastic. Boiling them can deform them and not allow for them to close as good as when they were new, that means you can have extra unfiltered air that you can breathe through them.  

Alse they may have different types of plastics embedded in the filtering material. That can be affected by the 100 degrees C in boiling water.  

If you have an electric oven that you can set a precise temp for a certain time, you can use it at 56 degrees C max. I have a FFP3 mask that's rated for 55 degrees C max (says on the packaging). Then you should blast your oven to max to get rid of anything that fell inside."

Small observational study shows incubation likely 5 days, not 14: https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(20)30154-9/fulltext

Cities were locked down 5 days ago, so we will likely see a jump and then some sort of plateau of infection. Buying time for R&D for treatment.

Appears to be 1.4-2.5 R0 . 3+ does not seem plausible. 2.5 is assuming no precautions are taken.

I sat on the shares because even if they are fudging or hiding some of their numbers, you can't deny they are making money and copying Amazon's business model to much success on that side of the globe.

The stock had problems getting above 200 a share and staying there for a bit.

I mean, it's pretty plausible that it was created. There's an article floating around where some researchers said it has some weird things on parts of it that show it's based off of the bat version of the virus, but so different that it has become its own thing. Another coincidence is that the couple in Canada that was sending Coronavirus samples to China. And the ""site"" of infection being so weirdly close to two labs that study the virus. Conspiracy theories are fun to dig through.

&#x200B;

At the same time, that could also just point to China knowing of this virus for longer than they've said.

&#x200B;

Now, it would be completely crazy to think the virus was unleashed on purpose. Why the hell would release it in the middle of their own country, near where it was probably made, with no way of containing it?"

In general, because of **poor survivability of these coronaviruses on surfaces,** there is likely very **low risk of spread from products or packaging** that are shipped over a period of days or weeks at ambient temperatures. **Coronaviruses are generally thought to be spread most often by respiratory droplets.** Currently there is no evidence to support transmission of 2019-nCoV associated with imported goods and there have not been any cases of 2019-nCoV in the United States associated with imported goods."

He states these report says this, some reports says this, and others say this. Cite those reports if you want to go and criticize another person for doing the exact same thing. I can say reports gave an R0 value of 5.1 and that wouldn't be a lie as that was the estimated R0 value a week ago by one of the 6 research organization but that has since been revised as new data has been gathered. Some research groups put the R0 between 2 and 3, while the WHO is more conservative with 1.5-2.5. This British group has it at 3.11 as of yesterday but had it at 3.5 last week and then 2.5 a few days ago ( [https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.01.23.20018549v2](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.01.23.20018549v2) ). SARS had a range of 2-5 with those numbers associated with different regions and time frames but he failed to mention that. Also he failed to mention that R0 is not of how fast a disease will spread (flu has an r0 of like 1.2 and infects tens of millions yearly) but the possibility of transmission. ( [https://www.news.com.au/lifestyle/health/health-problems/coronavirus-outbreak-what-is-an-r0-and-why-is-it-so-important/news-story/27054a834bafc405f69d04d1b4c2742c](https://www.news.com.au/lifestyle/health/health-problems/coronavirus-outbreak-what-is-an-r0-and-why-is-it-so-important/news-story/27054a834bafc405f69d04d1b4c2742c) )

He claims that there is no evidence that it can spread before symptoms arise but there have been reports of clusters of cases stemming from asymptomatic transmission (since the OP says that we can't say ""we can't trust China"" we have to assume these reports have the possibility of being accurate). This may be a fluke, an outlier, just a person with incredibly mild symptoms, etc. but there is currently evidence to support asymptomatic transmission (not to mention a lot of lung viruses are spread during incubation period, like the flu, so having this happen for this virus is not outlandish. Couple this with the fact that this virus is spreading faster and has infected more people than SARS that wasn't transmittable during the incubation period and you have a pretty good argument for asymptomatic transmission). ( [https://www.sciencemediacentre.org/expert-reaction-to-news-reports-that-the-china-coronavirus-may-spread-before-symptoms-show/](https://www.sciencemediacentre.org/expert-reaction-to-news-reports-that-the-china-coronavirus-may-spread-before-symptoms-show/) )

He criticizes the guy for saying the incubation period can be **up to** two weeks and then goes off and states that exact same thing but says that he is fear mongering. Sure the average is somewhere around a week but saying it can be up to two weeks is not fear mongering.

CDC says the **imminent** threat is low to Americans. AKA you don't need to go stockpiling supplies, wearing a respirator, etc. But the CDC also says this is a serious public health threat and the WHO has stated a high risk for the global region as of Jan 27 ( [https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/situation-reports](https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/situation-reports) ).  

Look I don't think this is really anything to sweat about (I'm a healthy young adult) but downplaying, not divulging all the information, not citing your sources and then calling out people for not citing sources, pulling out best case scenarios is also just as bad as fear-mongering. I don't think and many other experts think that  no one has enough data to access the global impact of this virus yet so swinging in either direction is bad, but its generally worse to downplay things."

But I wont call it entirely BS, while the homeopathy and its extemely fraud theory of potency  is shit and should be banned, Ayurveda does help in naturally building the resistance. I personally believe the science of Ayurveda and yoga should be researched further. Ayurveda is old doesn't mean its wrong or stupid.

Let me tell you story of my cousin,

My cousin is quite mentally retarded when compared to normal. But he didnt used to be the same always. In childhood he used to be really active as a baby but then he had to be stitched on his leg due to some puss or pimple. And the doctor while operating him stitched it deeper than he should.  The family took about few days to realize its legs were not moving (they assumed it was due to stitching), so they visited hospital again and they were told his limbs were paralyzed and soon he was gonna die due to some kind of poisoning, and hospital completely denied that they had anything to do with it, furthermore they were tricked into keeping the baby in hospital for some 'research' (they got to know this very late). Being not able to tolerate all this they decided to take the baby and take it to local ayurveda practitioner in kerela, He recognized the problem (deep stitch) and started treating the baby, slowly he started getting better and after 2 months Ayurvedic practioner left overnight because he was threatened by hospital.   


He didnt get perfectly fine but atleast he survived. Who knows if ayurveda had its chance, He may have got all fit and fine."

The corona virus is transmitted between humans now, so it doesn't discriminate victims by their diet. For what sins are corona-infected vegans, babies, or vulnerable dependents atoning? Or are we saying that Chinese people collectively deserve it for their cultural diet?

The bubonic plague, the one that has killed millions of people in 3 separate pandemics, was carried to humans by *fleas*. People didn't ""earn"" that infection from meat eating, they got it from being eaten.

Influenza has killed millions historically and continues to kill tens of thousands annually. No meat eating is required to pass this from birds to humans as it is passed through contaminated surfaces, droplets, and dust.

Polio is a human-only virus and it has killed thousands in several epidemics.

West Nile and Zika epidemics were passed to humans by mosquitos.

Source:University of Southampton

Summary: **Experts in population mapping have identified cities and provinces within mainland China, and cities and countries worldwide, which are at high-risk from the spread of the 2019 Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV).**

A report by the University's WorldPop team has found Bangkok (Thailand) is currently the city most at risk from a global spread of the virus -- based on the number of air travellers predicted to arrive there from the worst affected cities in mainland China. Hong Kong (China) is second on the list, followed by Taipei (Taiwan, the Republic of China). Sydney (12), New York (16) and London (19) are among 30 other major international cities ranked in the research.

The most 'at-risk' countries or regions worldwide are Thailand (1), Japan (2) and Hong Kong (3). USA is placed 6th on the list, Australia 10th and the UK 17th.

Within mainland China, the cities of Beijing, Guangzhou, Shanghai and Chongqing are all identified as high-risk by the researchers, along with the Chinese provinces of Guangdong, Zhejiang, Sichuan and Henan.

Andrew Tatem, Director of WorldPop and professor within Geography and Environmental Science at the University of Southampton, says: ""It's vital that we understand patterns of population movement, both within China and globally, in order to assess how this new virus might spread -- domestically and internationally. By mapping these trends and identifying high-risk areas, we can help inform public health interventions, such as screenings and healthcare preparedness.""

The team at WorldPop used anonymised mobile phone and IP address data (2013-15)1, along with international air travel data (2018)2 to understand typical patterns of movement of people within China, and worldwide, during the annual 40-day Lunar New Year celebrations (including the seven day public holiday from 24 to 30 January).

Major US companies are warning about the potential impact of the coronavirus on earnings calls

KEY POINTS

The word “virus” or “coronavirus” was mentioned by 27 different companies on earnings calls this week, according to a CNBC screening using FactSet.

Executives at Apple, Starbucks and McDonald’s are all raising flags about the impact the coronavirus could have on business.


The Wuhan virus has infected more than 6,100 people in China, topping the number of cases from 2003′s SARS virus. The coronavirus has killed more than 130 people and continues to spread throughout Asia and the U.S.
The virus is scaring Chinese citizens out of leaving their homes, pushing governments to consider or enact travel bans, and forcing investors away from stocks that rely on Chinese consumers. Now, the virus is worrying management at big U.S. businesses, including Apple, Starbucks and McDonald’s."

In a month coronavirus has killed less than 100.  
  
In the last ***week*** regular flu has killed 20,000.  
  
In a years time, this strain of coronavirus still won't have killed as many people as regular flu killed this past week."

The flu is 0.001% death rate, while the corona virus is 0.022% death rate, or 20x higher (with an unknown final number.)


So yes, *if they stop the spread of this disease* it will be overall less than the flu. But currently this shit is getting everywhere and there's an unknown future on it still. 


It's easy to say in hindsight that SARS *only* killed 800 people.... While conveniently ignoring that this particular Corona virus has already infected more people in just a few weeks than SARS did in a year. 


[Number of coronavirus infections in China surpasses SARS epidemic](https://nypost.com/2020/01/29/number-of-coronavirus-infections-in-china-surpasses-sars-epidemic/)


The current concern is that this is spreading very fast, *combined* with a high death rate. SARS had a high death rate but low spread, Flu has a low death rate by high spread. This is high+high at the moment until they see it slowing down."

As far as we know, it's 4,593 confirmed cases with 106 deaths at this point, most of the deaths are immunocompromised/elderly people in Wuhan. Because of the relative lack of information about SARS, it didn't really spring into the public consciousness until 257 people got infected in Ontario via a Chinese doctor staying in an HK hotel, and then everybody went apeshit. At this point travel has been so restricted that will likely be constrained to just a few individuals, if at all.

It's a strange feedback loop of China wanting to look like they're serious and not repeating past mistakes, so they're being much more transparent than they were in 2002 with SARS, but since they're being transparent the constant flow of new information freaks people out.

Associating a particular ethnicity or nationality with disease is a pretty classic racist tactic. Maybe there’s some context I’m missing, but this seems like a pretty straightforward case of someone doing that. Joanna is fighting a Chinese person, so she posts a photo of her wearing a mask, presumably with the implication she will need to avoid catching coronavirus when they fight.

If someone was fighting a gay fighter and said “hope I don’t get aids” as a “joke/meme,” would you find that homophobic?"

PS. For those who want to read on...
The ebola example highlights the rurality and infrastructure lacking resources of Sierra Leone where communication takes several days, and was part of the WHO indecision. Not to say that we cannot be better in our responses and everything the WHO does is perfect but Coronavirus is a vastly different situation from the Ebola outbreak. The logistical, information speed and resource availability is vastly superior. Also having the entire region under quarantine has in fact helped limit the spread and is a logistical fascination that should be studied from a Public Health psychology perspective, as all we’ve had in the past is small scales, computer modelling and Hollywood films. 


For those who are curious what it is like resource-wise on the ground in Africa, Doctors without Boarders has a great documentary that follows a Young 26YO Australian doctor as he’s put into a rural village similar to the ones where the Ebola outbreak first started. Great watch if you have time!

The CPC has carried out recently a political bullying program against Canada including imprisoning Canadians.
