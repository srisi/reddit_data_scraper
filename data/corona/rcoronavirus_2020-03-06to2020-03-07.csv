They produce oxygen and are a reminder that we are not the masters of the universe.  There is an entire living world that goes on without us.  

I really think we should stop fighting and in addition to supporting each other we take a moment each day to pray, meditate or whatever you want to call it to bring this world back from the brink and to have this virus die out.

South Korea s rate is 0.6, and they have done a phenomenal job of testing everyone that needs to be tested.

If you look at Wuhan, Iran and USA the rate is way, way higher, suggesting massive underreporting, due in part to inadequate testing . Given there are multiple cases of community transmission in the USA, there are probably thousands of cases already.  

Imperial College of London published a report a while back estimating the rate to be 0.8.  Believe it's report #4.

That being said, mortality is not the only measure that matters, to be sure, even 0.8 is many, many times higher than the flu.  Coronavirus is more contagious than the flu and greater % of coronavirus patients need medical attention than flu patients.  Death rate would obviously spike in the event that hospitals are overwhelmed. The 0.8 or 1 rate assumes everyone receives adequate care, that may not be the case if we don't improve our handling of this crisis."

2020-03-06,AdoptedPoster,Coronavirus,17,https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/feo622/maybe_i_have_a_natural_ability_president_plays/fjpaoxu/,"President Trump likes to say that he fell into politics almost by accident, and on Friday, as he sought to calm a nation gripped with fears over coronavirus, he suggested he would have thrived in another profession — medical expert.

“I like this stuff. I really get it,” Trump boasted to reporters during a tour of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta, where he met with actual doctors and scientists who are feverishly scrambling to contain and combat the deadly illness. Citing a “great, super-genius uncle” who taught at MIT, Trump professed that it must run in the family genes.

“People are really surprised I understand this stuff,” he said. “Every one of these doctors said, ‘How do you know so much about this?’ Maybe I have a natural ability.”

AD

But for members of the general public alarmed by more than 300 diagnosed cases in the United States — including at least 21 that his administration announced Friday were discovered on a cruise ship off the San Francisco coast — Trump’s performance during an impromptu 45-minute news conference at CDC was not necessarily reassuring.

Sporting his trademark red 2020 campaign hat with the slogan “Keep America Great,” the president repeatedly second-guessed and waved off the actual medical professionals standing next to him. He attacked his Democratic rivals — including calling Washington Gov. Jay Inslee a “snake” for criticizing his response — and chided a CNN reporter for smiling and called her network “fake news.” And he described coronavirus testing kits — which his administration has been criticized for being slow to distribute — as “beautiful” and saying they were as “perfect” as his Ukraine phone call last summer that led him to be impeached.

Mapping the spread of the coronavirus in the U.S. and worldwide

The upshot was that the self-proclaimed medical savant came off looking less interested in his administration’s unsteady efforts to mitigate the spread of the virus than he was in bolstering his own status in a campaign year. Trump repeatedly sought to judge his administration’s performance by the numbers of how many have been shown to have contracted the virus and comparing it to other nations — and, in doing so, appeared to be making judgments based solely on that scorecard.

AD

He declared he would prefer to keep the thousands of passengers and crew on the cruise ship off the California coast aboard the vessel rather than bring them ashore for quarantine, though he acknowledged that Vice President Pence and other top aides were arguing for the ship to be brought to port.

“I like the numbers being where they are,” Trump said. “I don’t need the numbers to double because of one ship that wasn’t our fault.” He had been furious last month upon learning that Americans in China with coronavirus were flown back to the United States in a decision made by the State Department without consulting him.

Asked if a decision had been made about the latest ship’s fate, Trump appeared uncertain. “Uh, that’s a good question,” he responded. He later said he authorized his aides to decide — and Pence announced at a news briefing in Washington shortly after the president concluded his remarks that the ship would, in fact, be directed to a noncommercial port where everyone on board would be tested.

AD

For the president, the reporters’ follow-up questions about the rate of coronavirus testing were a nuisance. CDC Director Robert Redfield and Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar stressed that the administration had authorized tens of thousands of testing kits to be distributed. But as Azar sought to parry with a reporter by calling on Redfield to back him up, Trump, without looking at Azar, raised his right hand and waved him off. 

21 people test positive for coronavirus on California cruise ship

Redfield said the agency had sent out 75,000 kits. Then Trump jumped in: “Anybody who wants a test will get a test, that’s the bottom line.” A few moments later, he jokingly compared the situation to his phone call last summer in which he had pressured Ukraine’s president to launch an investigation into Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden and his son.

“The tests are all perfect, like the letter was perfect, the transcription was perfect, right?” Trump said. “This was not as perfect as that, but pretty good.”

AD

Trump argued that the death rate in the United States — 15 Americans have died of the virus, though Trump said 11 — remains artificially high because many people who have the illness are not reporting to hospitals because their symptoms are minor. While experts have said that is probably true, the argument seemed to undercut Trump’s efforts to minimize the scope of the crisis.

While explaining this, Trump appeared irritated by the reaction of a reporter. “You’re smiling when I say that. Where are you from?” he asked. When she replied CNN, the president snapped: “I don’t watch CNN. That’s why I don’t recognize you. I don’t watch CNN because CNN is fake news.”

The medical professionals around him smiled uncomfortably.

AD

The president had a more positive reaction to Fox News. While explaining he had watched the network’s coronavirus coverage aboard Air Force One en route from Nashville — where he had toured tornado damage earlier in the day — to Atlanta, Trump cut himself off.

“How was the show last night?” Trump asked a Fox reporter in the room, referring to a Fox News-produced, town hall-style event in Scranton, Pa., that he had participated in the night before.

“Did it get good ratings?” Trump said. The reporter said he didn’t know. “Oh, really?” Trump continued. “I heard it broke all ratings records. But maybe that’s wrong. That’s what they told me.”

As his aides did their best to curry Trump’s favor — they praised his leadership and sought to reinforce some of his pronouncements — the president opined on the falling stock markets, insisting he is happy that Americans are canceling travel plans abroad to “stay in the United States and spend money in the United States.”

AD

Though his CDC trip had been canceled over a coronavirus scare at the agency — before being reinstated after the employee tested negative — Trump boasted that he was taking no special precautions while touring the labs.

“Not at all,” he said. “I’m not a person who has been big on handshaking. They used to make fun of me. But as a politician, you walk in and the doctors have their hands out, ‘Hello, sir.’ That’s my business. I never thought I’d be a politician. But I feel very secure.”"

Boy do I have a few botched testing stories from our public health system. I will say this. I guarantee there are numerous people in MSP alone with the disease in the wild because public health wouldn't test for stringent reasons which have since been relaxed. Missed opportunities. 

Its here. Its been here people. We are testing now so over the next few weeks we become a red spot on a map.

Edit. I understand from the dept of public health not having the kits at the time to test so they made it exclusive for their appropriate reasons. And this is a personal feeling. In the grand scheme of things it won't matter because the disease can't be contained. Has it yet anywhere? So testing or not I'd just like to state the obvious, assume it is in our community already more widespread than one case. And obviously use necessary precautions"

Some important information to better understand the data coming from Korea so far, and particularly the (comparatively) low fatality rate. The below applies to Daegu (the epicenter of the outbreak, representing about 4/5 of all cases in SK) only. 

- Of those infected, 38.0% are in their 20s. This is a reflection of the younger demographic of the Shincheonji cult.

- 13.7% are in their 40s, and 18.3% are in their 50s

-  **only 6%** of the infected are 70+

- for reference, [here is the age distribution of South Korea ](https://www.indexmundi.com/graphs/population-pyramids/south-korea-population-pyramid-2018.jpg)

- 2/3 of the infected are women

- 3/4 of the infected in Daegu are from the Shincheonji cult.

- 1760 are hospitalized

- **Over 90% of cases are unresolved at this time.**

Overall, this provides a possible explanation for the relatively low mortality rate we've seen from Korea thus far. According to worldometers, women are less likely to die from COVID-19, likely correlating with a lower prevalence of vascular conditions and smoking history.

Hogan also said the patients contracted the virus on an Egyptian cruise on the Nile River.

  The governor has declared a state of emergency to speed the delivery of funding and other resources to address the virus.

This is a developing story. It will be updated.

Original story is below:

Maryland health officials have launched a search for other people potentially infected with coronavirus, after three Montgomery County residents were found to have contracted the virus while traveling overseas.

County health workers are doing most of the work to track down anyone who might have come in contact with the three patients — a husband and wife in their 70s and a woman in her 50s."

First, they're detecting more mild cases, which implies real death rate is lower than we've previously suspected: great! Second, people will get treatment earlier, which might well materially reduce death rate, which is good for other countries only if they follow suit. Third, they might be detecting cases earlier, which are currently mild but might get worse, thus meaning that the underestimation of death rate from the group who haven't died *yet"" is more severe. This might mitigate the optimism of the first point somewhat.

\[TL;DR: Time for pandemic mitigation. Aggressive precautions to mitigate spread so hospitals aren't overwhelmed. Prepare for supply issues. \]

This is a difficult message to share, but it is important to **recognize how difficult the times ahead may be and how you must now take assertive action to prepare for them**. Our local situation surrounding novel coronavirus (COVID-19) is changing rapidly.  COVID-19 is spreading in our community, the extent of which is unclear. It has likely been spreading for weeks, perhaps months. I have no reason to believe that how it’s spreading in other counties won’t be replicated to some degree here. We now all need to take assertive actions to inhibit the spread of this new virus. Some of those actions are described below. I advise that individuals, schools, business, and all other sectors of our community take immediate steps to change behaviors and take definitive action.

**Our lives will be significantly disrupted** by the measures needed to respond to a global pandemic. A pandemic is a global occurrence of an infectious disease. A pandemic is a disaster with unique characteristics. The two most important differences between a pandemic and other disasters are that the whole world is going through this disaster at the same time, and people may become fearful of other people. The current COVID-19 outbreak clearly has the potential to turn into a severe pandemic.

County Health continues to work with the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and our state and local partners to manage testing and monitoring of persons who have been exposed to COVID-19. But our **focus is rapidly changing from a containment strategy (identifying cases and contacts) to one of community mitigation—taking steps to lessen the broad impact of the disease.** County Health and our public and private partners are taking steps to increase our ability to respond and are planning for a sustained response to COVID-19.

**How the world operates during a pandemic is different from how the world operates normally. This is not business as usual.** With a pandemic comes significant disruption to supply chains (the process of how things get from where they are made to where they are used), transportation, and travel. Even if the disease is not rapidly spreading in our area, we may face difficulty obtaining the goods and services we are accustomed to, public events may be canceled, and our ability to travel might be restricted.

San Mateo County Health continues to advise that the steps to prevent the spread of flu will also guard against the spread of COVID-19: cover your cough and sneeze, wash your hands frequently, avoid shaking hands and touching your face with unwashed hands, and if you are not feeling well or are experiencing cold, flu, or other symptoms, stay home from school or work. If you are mildly ill, there is no need to contact your primary care provider as they are very busy right now. If you are significantly ill, contact your primary care provider.

Here are the most important things for you to consider to improve your personal and organizational preparedness:

**What matters most is how households, neighborhoods, community groups, businesses, and other organizations prepare. What does that mean? Preparedness equals self-sufficiency. The government will help where it can, but it may have a limited ability to respond directly to you due to the scale of the disruptions.** 

Individual and community preparations should focus on three tasks—**reducing each person’s chance of getting sick** (see both individual and more general public health recommendations both above and below), **helping households with basic survival needs** during a pandemic, and minimizing and **coping with larger disruptions in how the normal day-to-day world works**.

All businesses and other organizations should now be done reviewing their continuity of operations plans for how they will operate if their employees are unable to work and how they will interact with members of the public and prepare to implement these plans soon.

**All medical facilities and providers should be done reviewing their surge plans for how to handle increased numbers of patients and be prepared to implement.**

Getting ready for a pandemic is largely about preparing for possible shortages. In a pandemic, supply chain disruptions are inevitable but are also unpredictable.

Since it contains vital supplies, a good start is to make sure your earthquake kit is up to date and ready to go. Of course, having supplies beyond the typical earthquake kit is a good idea. What you decide to have on hand is based on your individual and family situation and your individual preferences.

One likely shortage will be medications. **You should attempt to obtain a couple of months supply for your critical medications.**

**If you have other critical supply needs, you should conserve them and stock up on them now.**

Now is also the time to think about how you will care for loved ones at home if they or you are sick and how you would limit spread within the family.

Frequent and appropriate hand-washing is far from a perfect solution, but it’s easy, under your control, and has no significant downside.

Like washing your hands, wearing a surgical mask may help a bit, but you need to know that surgical masks don’t offer much protection when they are worn by people who are well. They are most helpful when worn by those who are already sick so that they are less likely to transmit the disease to others. Surgical masks and masks offering higher levels of respiratory protection are already in short supply and should be prioritized for use in health care settings.

You should use a barrier, such as a paper towel or tissue, to touch commonly touched surfaces, such as any door handles or elevator buttons.

&#x200B;

**Change from my previous message: I am now asking for the implementation of the activities below at this time.**

**All non-essential gatherings should be canceled, postponed, or done remotely. Unfortunately, at this time, I have no standard definition of “non-essential” or “gathering” to guide your decisions.  Use your best judgment.**

**Stop shaking hands.**

**Increase in the amount of remote working or teleworking to the extent possible especially for those who appear at higher risk for developing the disease, those over the age of 60 and those with co-morbid conditions.**

**Under all circumstances, stop touching your face, eyes, nose, or mouth with your unwashed hands.**

&#x200B;

I am **not** asking for the implementation of these activities *\[listed below\]*, but these are the types of activities we may need to implement in the future:

School closures. Schools are an essential gathering. School closings present a particularly vexing social distancing dilemma but may be necessary to protect public health. Once school closings occur, they may be extensive and extended.

Social distancing—staying at least 6 feet away from all other people—should be attempted where possible.

Rationing (a formal process of prioritizing distribution and use) of critical supplies may need to occur.

To get ourselves through the hard times that may be coming, your community may need volunteers. Think now about the skills you have and how you can help your community. Heed the call should volunteers be requested.

Other public health interventions that have been used with some effect in other countries include commandeering of both real estate or personal property, conscription, curfew, and cordons. It is unlikely that these interventions would be used here due to practical considerations.

Issues around testing for COVID-19. You may have received incorrect information from the federal and state government on March 4, 2020. San Mateo County does not currently have testing available independently of the state and CDC. The amount of testing that is available through the state and CDC is severely limited. Should testing become more widely available, testing will be prioritized based on healthcare infrastructure concerns, risk of exposure, and/or very sick hospitalized patients. Tests will not automatically be given upon request or by a physician’s order. This may change as testing capacity evolves over the next few months.

This is a phase I, open-label, dose ranging clinical trial in males and non-pregnant females, 18 to 55 years of age, inclusive, who are in good health and meet all eligibility criteria. This clinical trial is designed to assess the safety, reactogenicity and immunogenicity of mRNA-1273 manufactured by ModernaTX, Inc. mRNA-1273 is a novel lipid nanoparticle (LNP)-encapsulated mRNA-based vaccine that encodes for a full-length, prefusion stabilized spike (S) protein of 2019-novel coronavirus (nCoV). Enrollment will occur at one domestic site. Forty-five subjects will be enrolled into one of three cohorts and will receive an intramuscular (IM) injection of mRNA-1273 on Days 1 and 29 in the deltoid muscle. **Subjects will be followed through 12 months post second vaccination (Day 394).** 

The primary objective is to evaluate the safety and reactogenicity of a 2-dose vaccination schedule of mRNA-1273, given 28 days apart, across 3 dosages in healthy adults."

Treatment options get better. Still, 5 to 15 percent of over 70 crowd succumb, there’s a blip of other deaths due to hospital overcrowding, and overall life expectancy goes down. Then a vaccine levels off the number of new cases. We reach a new stasis, with fewer aged people with underlying health conditions (the cohort that consumes the largest percentage of health care services). Better pandemic preparedness.
