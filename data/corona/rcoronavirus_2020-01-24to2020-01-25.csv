2020-01-24,KingBTC,Coronavirus,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/ethwel/parents_booking_holidays_for_summer_ngl_little/ffgiosi/,"Just because you get sick doesn't mean you will die. Current mortality rates for Coronavirus appear to be 35%, and AFAIK those were mostly the elderly. First world healthcare system are more than capable of keeping people alive while their bodies off the virus.

Ebola in the US has a mortality rate of 2 deaths out of 11 infections. 18% for a virus that usually has a mortality of 25 -90%

The CDC also doesn't take any chances with these types of pandemics. They understand that our best chance to beat the pandemic is prevention, not treatment. Our healthcare system can easily manage these diseases, however if the number of infections increase it can easily go beyond their control. Identification, monitoring, quarantine, and rapid treatment of those identified is the name of the game. 

I'm not sure how much is actually known about this virus but I have heard that incubation can be weeks (time it takes to get sick) but you are also contagious during this time (infecting other people but you don't realize you are sick). This is all anecdotal so we will understand in time.

Have faith in your healthcare system, we are standing on the shoulders of giants."

With at least two new cases in France confirmed today, more will come. With whom did those people make contact? And what is the transmission like? 

Even if death rate turns out to be low, social and economic impacts will likely be high (even if localized) - and clearly the fear factor is already high, which will also put strain on hospital/healthcare systems."

People are flying all over there to celebrate the Chinese New Year.

I may only work for a U.S airline, but everyone can agree that the Chinese government downplayed this first because the timing of this would‚Äôve ruined everything that already happened, was supposed to happen. You think they wanted to cancel the New Year? They don‚Äôt want WHO to declare an emergency, so they are still reporting inaccuracies.

You should also look up why we can‚Äôt ground all air traffic from China, we have done a natural experiment on that post 9/11 when everyone was scared to fly and it just so happened to be fly season. More people died than not.

More viewers and readers equals more money paid for ads on their networks and sites. You can sum up most major media stories into ones that make you happy, scared or angry. Those are the most basic emotions and they play on it. 

&#x200B;

They provide their purpose. They inform you. But they do it manipulatively.

Compound that with the fact that its a new virus that we don't understand that seems to be infecting people at an alarming rate. Its a wet dream for the media. 

&#x200B;

The point to truly be alarmed is if an abnormal amount of people in the 18-35 range start to die. The very young and very old always get picked first for Satan's gym class. Too weak to fight it off or pre existing conditions. If you're looking at a high mortality rate for healthy prime aged adults..Then its an oh shit this might be the big one scenario."

It might have been spreading to a large amount of people and now it's just appearing and even then its continuing to spread. 

I also get why jokes about the coronavirus is downplaying the severity of it. However, the best way to feel better is to joke about it. People handle stress in different ways and comedy helps.

Take precautions in us no matter what. N95 full face mask is not overkill because exposed eyes can catch it too. Major stores like Home Depot have already been robbed clean of N95 masks."

We don't know exactly when the virus starts to be contagious within a host during that time, and we don't know how long it stays contagious afterward.  


That being said, there are likely thousands, if not in the tens of thousands, of people that are infected currently, but not showing symptoms yet. It all depends on how smart people are about not getting infected and not infecting others... even if they are not feeling symptoms. I live in the USA, and I bet within 2 weeks we'll have over 100 reported cases here.  


It is good to have a healthy respect and concern for this virus. However, don't get too anxious about it. Remember to wash your hands. Don't touch your mouth, eyes, or nose with your hands. Cough/sneeze into your clothing. Etc... The same practices we know about the flu.

That the numbers of infected and dead coming out of China are not accurate. Due to China‚Äôs loose lips sink ships policy. The communist party does not want any kind of negative tension so they‚Äôre going to smug the numbers. The virus has a 7 to14 day incubation period which means that people can carry the virus before 7 to 14 days before showing any symptoms. Only good thing is people who were not showing symptoms are less likely to transmit the disease.But they still can it‚Äôs more likely that tens of thousands are infected and just are not showing symptoms. China spent more time during the initial outbreak arresting people in journalist for posting about the virus online, then actually doing anything to contain it. Oh not to mention they actually went into the market and fumigated the entire place killing the virus there which to most people sounds like a good thing but if you know anything about Virology, you would know that you need the original strain of the virus to develop effective antivirals so unless someone can get a hold of the original strain it can mutate and become impossible to control."

Draconian because there are 20 million international passengers traveling into and out of US each MONTH.  And with the 2 week+ incubation period on this virus, you'd have to shut down for at least a month.  US also brings in over a million tons of cargo by plane internationally each month.  Cutting 20 million people and 1 million tons of cargo is a giantic disruption. And would it help? There are already cases here.  And, potential sources can walk over our shared borders (from Canada and Mexico).  Huge impacts and not perfect.  We'd be better off focusing on treatment and prevention."

I know that because people who infected other countries didn't report the symptoms and went back to their home. The french woman who was infected even post on facebook she took some pills so she could decrease her body temperature, the airport screen didn't indicated she had fever and she denied any symptom so she could go back to France.

1.  It overwhelms the existing medical supplies.
2.  Without intensive care level prevention which is antivirals and plenty of saline, ventilators, etc. the rate of death is higher.
3.  It kills medical staff and that leads to more deaths.

Just because the last pandemic was in 1918 doesn't mean all of Australia that has been dealing with smoke for months won't lose people.  Yes, the US needs to close it's borders until we can handle a brand new virus similar to SARS with 100x the number of super spreaders."

Meaning more money for biotech and the pharmaceutical companies, In the US biotech only makes up 1% of the US economy, but US pharmaceutical firms make up 45% of the global pharmaceutical market, meaning if there‚Äôs a global pandemic there will be huge profits for US pharmaceutical companies.

Also another economic benefit (less important of course) is that gas prices will drop because of a lack of demand for international travel as the outbreak worsens ( just like we saw today). Also according to a report on the Economic Effects of the Spanish Flu, by the St. Louis Fed, that states who had the highest number of deaths during that outbreak, had the highest rate of per capital income growth following the outbreak.  Probably because with a scarcity of workers, the ones who survived the illness could demand more salary.

So there are some benefits to a global pandemic, and the people who would stand to profit are the biotech firms, pharmaceutical firms, and the survivors of the pandemic."

So, you claim to be living in the US & working in healthcare, but you seem to struggle to write like an American. Bit confusing, but anyways.


Shutting down ALL international travel would be an incredibly disproportionate response for something similar to normal influenza.

> I‚Äôm not an expert

No, you're not. Neither am I. So we should leave these decisions to the experts instead of running around, fear-mongering.

It's already too late to shut down travel, the contagions have already propagated at a global scale. Seasonal flu already kills 400k a year, are you gonna stop travel every winter for that?"
