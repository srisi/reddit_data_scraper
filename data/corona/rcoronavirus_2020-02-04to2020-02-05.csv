I am a nurse and as a side note I am deeply confused regarding the current information being disseminated to the public about masks. I do not understand why we aren‚Äôt promoting education on proper use of ppe to protect the public from spreading/acquiring infectious disease. Even if this does all ‚Äúfizzle out‚Äù and ends up not being a significant healthcare issue in the USA the amount of miss information that has been spread about using masks is alarming. It seems like this would be a fantastic time to educate the public on how to use an n95 vs basic surgical mask/ear loop mask if there is confusion over what they are used for and how to properly use them.  

Wash your hands... put on mask... press metal tab to form to nose... don‚Äôt touch your face... wash your hands again before taking mask off... wash your hands again after removing mask if entering a clean environment. Most males wear a size medium... smaller males a small... larger males a large. Most females wear a size small... larger females a medium.  You wear n95 masks to prevent infection AND reduce risk of transmission to others. Ear loop/surgical masks are to be worn if you are ill to prevent spreading it to others.

Perhaps use the public‚Äôs interest in this new virus to help reduce the spread of the much much worse and more terrifying flu (yes I‚Äôm being sarcastic).  Discontinuing the use of masks in urgent cares and ED‚Äôs seems negligent given that it is cold and flu season.... and I honestly can‚Äôt come up with a reason why it would do anything but help prevent the spread of nCOV as well.

The only theory I have is that due to the demand we do not have the ability to produce the number of masks needed. I know many manufacturers have increased production but I‚Äôm assuming there are only so many masks able to be produced in a given time and they are in short supply at the moment. I have no evidence to support this theory and no experience with mask manufacturing so its pure speculation on my part. That is my only theory on disappearing masks I can‚Äôt fathom any other reason why this is happening.  Sorry for the wall of text... I have spent a lot of time thinking about masks recently lol"

- Vitamin c and e
- Green tea
- Alpha lipoic acid
- Coq10
- Resveratrol 
- NAC

Any plant extract would help including pinnacle. Some directly prevent the virus from replicating but you'd have to do research. NAC stops some flu strains but not others. 

If you can keep yourself alive long enough to fight the virus then you can survive. So being in excellent cardio shape is probably best of all.

And for those wondering, antioxidants are good during times of intense stress and inflammation such as an illness or injury. You don't want to take them all the time. Exercise is also a type of stress and if you load up on antioxidants you can blunt your body's adaptive response. It's weird but our body has evolved such that a little poison makes you stronger.

Other nations may not even be close to being as readily prepared as we are and I don't think we can simply ban travel everywhere in the world.

During the Ebola outbreak, our hospital was designated as the major receiving hub of an international airport (and the closest). All patients from an effected country with a fever and another symptom were brought to us. We were given n95s, shower caps from med/surg, shoe covers and a gown. We tried to tell them that wasn‚Äôt enough. The only study at the time said that pregnant women would present hemorrhaging(not on the cdc‚Äôs list), not with fever. We asked them during our half assed training with our crappy PPE what we were supposed to do..? If any other mom presents hemorrhaging we deliver immediately. But surgery makes Ebola ridiculously airborne. And we‚Äôve then exposed, OBGYN, first assist, primary RN, circulating RN, charge RN, nicu RN, respiratory therapist, the NNP.. And then where would baby go? To Nicu??? To infect all the other babies?  We were told to leave the woman in the negative pressure room, call the CDC, and wait 2-4 hours until they arrived so they could test her before doing anything. ?!? She doesn‚Äôt have 2-4 hours if she‚Äôs bleeding to death! So you want us to let her die while we watch through the window? So is there a policy to protect us if she dies and then ends up being negative? Nope!
After contacting the CDC multiple times and a doc on the ground in Africa, admins agreed to give us one hood (no respirator). He threw it at me and told me I could wear it for every patient if it made me feel better. (For profit hospitals get pissed when you ask them to spend money.)
So basically fuck the CDC for not learning from that and putting healthcare workers on the line again without the proper equipment and training. If they want to allow these flights, they should land in one location and THEY should care for them. And train the nurses and supply them with the best equipment to protect them.
I won‚Äôt do it again. And I applaud the Hong Kong nurses for taking a stand. You don‚Äôt get to save money and put us and our families at risk to clean up your mess."

frozen foods are great, but if you get to a situation where you are stuck in your home, eat those first, if the power goes out, theyll all go bad.

CLEANING SUPPLIES.  bleach, alcohol wipes.

IF you have someone sick in your home, they MUST be isolated.  Pets must be kept separated or preferably outdoors.  Youll want duct tape, plastic sheeting, LOTS of hand sanitizer.  Even with all this, you're only delaying the inevitable, but this matters, because it's better to have 1 sick person at a time than a house full of sick people that are too sick to care for each other.

Even in a worst case scenario, the chaos will not be permanent, the virus will run through the population, and survivors (most people) will have immunity, and services will be able to be restored, but this could take weeks or longer.

I'm not saying this is GOING TO HAPPEN, I'm saying it could, and if you do not prepare now, if it does happen, you will be stuck in the mad rush to get to grocery store shelves that may be empty.  The shelves in wuhan ran bare quickly, people were fighting for food, there was a riot at a vegetable market.

We know you can infect others prior to showing symptoms. As security did not know how to handle the situation, they clearly have come into contact with individuals not wearing N95 masks or better. Therefore, the security could just as easily be infected and not showing symptoms. Yes, that may be a small chance, but is it worth the risk to pull down your mask?

More importantly, OP won by educating security. Now that they have had to deal with an individual wearing a mask, who refuses to remove the mask, they will need to discuss how to adjust their current protocols. With mainstream media actually taking the virus seriously (well more are starting to), we are going to see an increase in masks, especially at airports and other forms of transportation."

We spent a week on an island in the Caribbean when they announced they were getting their first cases and a week later, both my husband and I were sicker than dogs, complete with full body aches and pains, bloodshot eyes and nasty rash. The two doctors I went to see looked at me like I was crazy even though I showed all the symptoms  and brought my passport and the news articles stating the virus was discovered on the island when I was there. One doctor even had to google Zika and reference the Mayo clinic on symptoms, then told me to go home and take ibuprofen too. 

I then contacted a scientist at a local university here who had been quoted in the newspaper about his team creating a vaccine for Zika and asked what I should do or if he needed volunteers to study and was brushed off AGAIN. 

My concern was that we were trying to start a family and we should wait to get the all clear but the doctors told me not to worry about it. We waited two and a half years anyway and I still had a miscarriage  (but I think and hope it was due to other extenuating circumstances rather than Zika.)

Of course, it seems that Zika has fizzled out now and the cold weather where I live has helped keep the mosquito population down. With the h2h transmission of the Coronavirus and the mortality rate, I hope they're taking people who present with symptoms more seriously this time."

Conspiracy being : 

the official numbers are entirely fabricated. 
not even ""rounded down"" figures, not ""half of the actual"".  
complete fiction! 

that would mean, that any response, any evaluation of the situation, any reassuring guess - would be invalid. 

ps: that would also mean, that no useful data can be gained from all those pretty graphs and maps floating around here. 
the best models and predictions are worthless if you feed them with false information. that is called GIGO - garbage in, garbage out.  

in extension that would also mean, that the real life numbers are even scarier than the fake ones. and that is what is making me panic a little."

You have two types of lymphocytes in your blood. B and T. B lymphocytes produce proteins that attach themselves to viral components in your body. When a B lymphocyte comes across something that triggers its antibody production, it dumps a bunch of plasma cells out that produce antibodies. Those antibodies are the key. They have little sticky parts that fit into the virus. When they fit together, the antibodies pretty much ""mark"" the invader as bad. After this happens, T lymphocytes look for those markers. They both send out alerts that they've spotted bad cells, and directly destroy bad cells themselves.

The problem is that those antibodies are very specific to certain virus cells and bacteria. If the key portion can't stick to the surface of the virus cell, it wont be marked for death.

In short, by sequencing the genome of this virus, we better know what kinds of keys your body needs to make, in order to mark cells as bad by sticking to their surface. We can engineer a vaccine, which is just a blueprint that will teach your lymphocytes about the shape of the keys needed to mark cells.

Now, you may have heard people talking about ""cytokine storms."" What those are is essentially what happens above, with the B. lymphocytes dumping things into the body that mark cells for death and T cells doing the assassination work and signaling. Sometimes a foreign body, like a virus, can cause your lymphocytes to go wild, and they throw out signals that cause other fighting cells to throw out signals and rush to the area. That causes  swelling, fluid build up, fevers, or even death. That is a cytokine storm."

I just think they didn't know exactly what it was.

Maybe I had something else that caused flu like symptoms and red dots. But it was gone by the time the results got back so who cares.

Dengue.... Ugh. Please never again. Got that 3 times. Consecutively. The secondary name ""breakbone fever"" does it justice. Just few weeks later I got the mexican swine flu.... That was a terrible year for me.

So I think that:

1. China is lying. This is very bad because the rest of the world doesn't know crucial intel about this virus. They simply are not to be trusted. They want to solve the problem but they also need to save face. It's in their authority gene for too long. I think that the efforts of China to stop this virus was, are and they will be tremendous . I have no doubt. But this was, is and will be also valid for their efforts to hide the truth.
2. The origin of the virus is the tricky part. I mean the ***real*** origin. The official story is that this virus came from the seafood market. Maybe. Maybe not. Maybe this virus occurred naturally. Or maybe not. If not, now that's a big story.
3. If this virus did not in fact occurred naturally, then it's somehow the human factor involved. So it's artificial. This artificial occurrence can have only two types of action associated: intentional or unintentional action that lead the virus to spread to humans. If unintentional, than the answer is maybe the BSL-4 lab from Wuhan. If intentional, than we have some other answers.
4. I don't know a lot about the reality from China. But it seems that there is a lot of big commotion over there. And I don't know a lot about this world but I see measures taken from big players unseen until now. For what I can reason, all this commotion and heavy measures is directly affect China. I mean this country economy. Money again.
5. So I think, if we are following the money, that the logical explanation is somehow that this natural accident is not that natural and not that accident. I don't like the word conspiracy. I like instead two words: truth and lie. Instead of categorizing some event as a reality or conspiracy, I prefer to make it simple. I like it classic. Truth or lie.
6. China is lying but China is also almost dying. And I really don't think this is an accident. And if this is true, maybe someday we will learn who is responsible for this. I have my favorites (they are not so many, aren't they ?) but let's not go too far.
7. Stay safe they all say. I agree. Stay also informed and aware. The problem is that is not easy when everyone is lying..."

That‚Äôs how SARS spread in Toronto. Someone with the virus sat there all day, infected everybody and it broke out.

Notice the regions where people were expecting it don‚Äôt have nearly as many deaths? 96% of the deaths have been in one province. Seems more like an administrative problem.

The deaths are then only people diagnosed and then die. People that have died and not diagnosed and recorded from home or before they receive a test are not included. This is due to the reason they can't technically prove they died from the virus as with the epidemic there simply isn't time to waste on someone who passed away when others are about to die.

If it were my kid I would pull them until credible information that covers specifics about the virus, it's transmission, it's effects, containment efforts, containment success, etc is released.

Personally I feel we are intentionally not being informed to ward off panic and to buy time. I believe there are some very smart people right now that are maxed out and super buy trying to figure out how to best face this. Whether it's a cure, public relations, immunization, etc.

For your families sake and at the word of the WHO ""consider this a pandemic"" and ""containment measures will fail"". It's family first. You may be religious (I am not) and that's fine, but sequester your faith, keep it in God not the government. To them you are merely a number. Mine starts with 005.

No matter how bad things get we will get through this. Don't panic, Don't freak out (too much). Focus your efforts on the one thing that should matter most to you, your family. Protect them at all costs, even if it includes judgement, retribution, alienation, or condemnation. The fact of the matter is at the end of the day nothing else matters than the one you love.

Yesterday is gone, tomorrow may never come. Make the best of today. 

If it's any consolation, my son had an appointment today and one on Thursday for his braces. Both have been rescheduled for another time. 

It's hard to measure risk when you don't have all the pertinent information. In this case though, the outcomes can be severe.

They would love to sweep it under the rug as the flu if it‚Äôs possible. 

Please keep spreading your story! 

Just like the doctors laughed at my family members (5 people) for years and told them they were paranoid when they thought they had Lyme.  Years later they have all tested positive.  

My friend‚Äôs husband had horrible symptoms for almost a year - to the point of lying in a bathtub all day in pain, blood in stool, but doctors refused to give him a colonoscopy because he was in his early 30s.  Only after after going to multiple doctors and my girlfriend literally crying & begging  they agreed to test.  He had stage 4 colon cancer and just died last month. 

They refused to give my mother a Papsmeer because she was too old.  I went to her doctor and said ‚Äúbut she had colon cancer, which she told you, and that oncologist confirmed was from HPV.‚Äù  The doctor said ‚Äúoh, yes we should test‚Äù.    You can die from HPV,  why not just be safe, not risk a life and run the test?  What do people do that don‚Äôt have educated advocates looking out for them??? 

Really didn‚Äôt know how insane everything was until managing my mother‚Äôs health.  The gyno still refused to test my mother for a yeast infection even though my mother insisted she had symptoms and was very uncomfortable because again she was too old for yeast infections.  The woman is uncomfortable has had them before and knows what they feel like.  Could you run the bloody test just in case??   I still can‚Äôt believe all of it - this is just one instance we encountered similar mind f* situations with other doctors."

This would seem to indicate a significant and growing number of suspected cases.

Keep in mind the confirmations we are seeing today are infections that happened 10 to 16 days ago.

It takes about 5 days to notice symptoms (on average), a few more days (3-5 days) for symptoms to become severe enough to seek professional help, a few more (5-7 days) for test results (this delay is getting longer.)  Plus another 1 day for reporting.

This means the cross contamination effects of any of the confirmed cases currently popping up internationally won't be known for another 1.5 to 2.5 weeks.

Google Translation not edited (china media):


Hong Kong drug thugs and rampants, in order to politicize the epidemic and tear up the relationship between the Mainland and Hong Kong, they ignored the overall situation of the fight against the epidemic, ignored the safety of Hong Kong citizens, and ignored the lives of patients with new coronary pneumonia. The strike on medical care requires the SAR Government to implement a comprehensive customs clearance.







However, if you think this group of puppets is trampled on the bottom line of human conscience and morality, then you are wrong. Because in order to further threaten the Hong Kong Government, he has also started to create panic in Hong Kong. In addition to the violent terror that has already begun, it has also become a cult.



Yes, the thugs have learned a cult, pretending to be patients with new crown pneumonia all over Hong Kong, performing ""sudden fall to the ground"", which has caused panic among the Hong Kong people who are not aware of the truth.



For example, at the gate of the MTR, I suddenly ‚Äúcan't afford to fall to the ground‚Äù, and then the public panicked.







Suddenly lay down on the escalator in the mall, pretending to be a zombie.







Also, I fell to the ground facing the security guard, pretending that the patients with new coronary pneumonia suddenly died of illness. It's a pity that the security guard saw it and watched his performance quietly.







The following maggot fell under the supermarket shelf in an attempt to cause panic.







Inside the subway car, it also became a place for performances.







Someone pretending to be a new crown pneumonia patient, performing a sudden death in Zhongnan Square, attracting police and citizens to watch. From the perspective of not many people wearing masks, it seems that the performance failed.







There was also a performance on the platform of the MTR. As a result, security guards and the public looked indifferent.







Citizens are having a meal at the restaurant, and there is a disgusting performance. As a result, the performance was different.







Someone at the Central Station of the subway suddenly fell to the ground, pretending that the pneumonia patient died. As a result, many citizens were really frightened. They immediately stated on social media that they would support comprehensive customs clearance.







Still performing at the MTR gate.







This puppet performed on the street, and then it really recruited an ambulance! I wonder what the medical staff on the ambulance think!







A son-in-law performed a pneumonia patient at Jordan MTR station but did not pretend to be dead.







There was a panic at Tsuen Wan Station.







This cricket was also performing in a subway station, creating panic.







Almost all subway stations have performances that threaten the people of Hong Kong.







There are also performances on the street.







I also summarized the panic-stricken performance through the Internet. They said, ""Someone believes it's fine. Many Hong Kong pigs.







Well, Hong Kong citizens who believe and support you because of the panic created by you are called ""pigs"" by you!



Through the performance of pretending to be a pneumonia patient yesterday and falling to the ground, the thugs have become more than just violent terrorists, they have also become cultists."

She was basically disabled for a year while living in the mountains of La Gonave, Haiti and still has problems. I find that straight up terrifying.

Most people in Haiti didn‚Äôt believe that Zika caused microcephaly. Even the NGOs and missionaries said they hadn‚Äôt seen it at all there, but it was prominent in places like Brazil where they had sprayed for mosquitoes with a chemical that‚Äôs banned because it causes microcephaly.
