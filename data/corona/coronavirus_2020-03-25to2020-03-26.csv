If that was actually a COVID-19 patient, people would not at all be touching him or at least they would touch him with those hazmat suits that we've seen Chinese soldiers use when patrolling around Wuhan. People in China (and areas like Italy where they've seen the devastating impact of COVID-19) are fucking terrified of the virus and if there was a potential patient having it near them, it doesn't make sense for them to keep close recording and or for the police be touching the guy. And before anyone accuses me, I am not a China troll or working for the CCP, in fact I'm Taiwanese and have an immense hatred for the CCP and the mainland Chinese government.

Not to mention, any scenario where the IFR is really that low can only happen with an R0 much, much higher than the seasonal flu. Consider this: our healthcare system can cope with a typical flu season as the caseload is spread out over several months. How would the system cope if a typical flu season caseload was instead compressed into the span of four weeks? Now, multiply the hospitalization rate by 2x, 3x, 4x, so on. And any claim that COVID-19 doesn't result in a higher hospitalization rate than the flu is absolutely not grounded in any evidence whatsoever.

This is similar to the other top post a few days ago of two videos spliced together of completely different women in different stores, one being arrested and the other appearing to spit on some bananas. The caption claimed the first woman was arrested for spitting on fruit while testing positive for Coronavirus and everybody ate it up even though the correct sources posted in the comments only stated the first woman was arrested for a disturbance between an employee, no mention of spitting or Coronavirus.

Do people not see the irony in claiming everything coming out of China is fake but instantly believing a video in a foreign language with no source? Not to mention the source that was eventually provided is a Falun Gong affiliate who may honestly be even less reliable than Chinese state media.

I'm not claiming the number of cases coming out of China are accurate. There are real problems with the CCP that affect real people. Believing everything you see that relates to China without any second guessing or questioning is undermining the actual issues."

He also said that if you know that a land has pandemic, then you're forbidden to enter it, similarly, if you're on a land that has pandemic, then you're forbidden to leave.

The Quran said in Chapter 5 Verse 32: ""On that account: We ordained for the Children of Israel that if any one slew a person - unless it be for murder or for spreading mischief in the land - it would be as if he slew the whole people: and if any one saved a life, it would be as if he saved the life of the whole people.

Because of those words from the fucking president himself, a large group of people still dont take this virus and this situation seriously. They still think its overblown, that its overreaction, that it will blow over like sars did or that its just like a normal flu its nothing serious.

This isnt a runny nose and some sneezing thing, if you catch the worst of it, you feel like you're choking for air while simultaneously aching all over your body, dehydration, confusion, headaches. 

Most experts and nations expect upwards of 70% of the global population to be infected if people dont take it seriously.

That is **5.4 Billion** Humans.

Out of those its expected 20-30% will need/seek hospital care and be admitted (CDC Figures).

That means **1.08 Billion - 1.62 Billion** humans will need hospital care. (you can probably add another 20-30% who will go to the hospital seeking care but turned away as they dont need to be admitted and can recover at home)

While between 5-10% will need intensive care. (based on extrapolated data from confirmed cases vs those that get intensive care)

> About 80% of deaths and 45% of hospitalizations for COVID-19 in the U.S. are among adults aged 65 or older, with the risk of serious illness and death increasing with age, according to a report released today by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The findings are similar to data from China, the agency said. While severe COVID-19 illness leading to hospitalization can occur at any age, children appear to have milder illness, with almost no hospitalizations for those under age 19, CDC said. According to the report, an estimated 21% to 31% of U.S. COVID-19 patients between Feb. 12 and March 16 were hospitalized, with 5% to 12% admitted to an intensive care unit. An estimated 1.8% to 3.4% of U.S. COVID-19 patients died over the period. [source](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/69/wr/mm6912e2.htm?s_cid=mm6912e2_e&deliveryName=USCDC_921-DM23064)

thats between **270-540 Million people needing intensive care**.

If this pandemic continues to be disregarded as it is, it will lead to the amount of people infected at the same time growing far beyond the capacity and resources available.

To emphasize lets look at the US statistics.

If we use USA as a example with 70% infection rate, that would mean 230 Million Americans will get the Covid-19 Virus.

Out of the 230 Million, 20-30% will be admitted into hospital care (CDC). 

= **46-70 Million Americans will require Hospital Care.**

Currently the US has only [924,107 staffed hospital beds](https://www.aha.org/statistics/fast-facts-us-hospitals) TOTAL.

and statistics show already the hospitals have a **[occupancy rate of 65%.](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/hus/2017/089.pdf)** 

Meaning that out of the 1M hospital beds, on average, 600,669 Hospital beds will already be in use by other patients for other illnesses and issues. Which leaves only

924,107 - 600,669 = **323,437 available hospital beds.**

Heck **IF EVEN ONE %** of those infected require intensive care in the US at the same 2 week period, thats going to be almost 500,000 people needing hospital beds where there are only 300,000 available (with only max 100K intensive care beds).

AND to make matters worse, this is all disregarding the amount of hospital workers/suppliers/producers doctors,nurses, emergency responders who will also be affected by Covid-19.

Even rich people wont all have access to the same resources. They can try to self-isolate on their mansions and such, but this is a very infectious virus, to put it in a simple way. In a normal flu, you have a infection rate of 1.35. Meaning you infect that many people they infect that many people and so on, if you do so for 10 steps, you end up with around under 100 people infected. The Covid 19 virus on the other hand, it has a infection rate of 2.4. Which means by 10 steps you would have upwards of 60,000 infected.

**That is why its important that everyone stay inside so that this virus can go through the world gradually and hopefully minimize the infection rates and eventually be vaccinated against and die off.**

Recommendation from the CDC;

> The risk for serious disease and death in COVID-19 cases among persons in the United States increases with age. Social distancing is recommended for all ages to slow the spread of the virus, protect the health care system, and help protect vulnerable older adults. Further, older adults should maintain adequate supplies of nonperishable foods and at least a 30-day supply of necessary medications, take precautions to keep space between themselves and others, stay away from those who are sick, avoid crowds as much as possible, avoid cruise travel and nonessential air travel, and stay home as much as possible to further reduce the risk of being exposed (7). Persons of all ages and communities can take actions to help slow the spread of COVID-19 and protect older adults.†

edit: [more sources.](https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coronavirus-disease-2019-covid-19?source=history_widget)

> As of March 25, 2020, the outbreak of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) had been confirmed in around 195 countries or territories. The virus had infected 423,330 people worldwide, and the number of deaths had totaled 18,906. The most severely affected countries outside of China include Italy, the U.S., Spain, and Germany. [source](https://www.statista.com/statistics/1043366/novel-coronavirus-2019ncov-cases-worldwide-by-country/)

edit: Another source that supports the CDC figures above, with latest figures from 23rd of march. [Source.](https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/sites/default/files/documents/RRA-seventh-update-Outbreak-of-coronavirus-disease-COVID-19.pdf)

> Recent modelling of the basic reproductive number (R0) from Italy estimate
R0 between 2.76 and 3.25. Researchers from Lombardy who analysed the early phase of the outbreak in their
region reported a reduction in R0 shortly after the introduction of mitigation measures [23]. This is consistent with 
findings from China. A recent review of 12 modelling studies reports the mean R0 at 3.28, with a median of 2.79.
R0 is proportional to the contact rate and will vary according to the local situation. Further research is needed to
get a more accurate estimate of R0 in the various outbreak settings [23]

If that is correct and the infection rate is at near 3, then this pandemic is even more so important to take seriously.


EDIT: To the people who are saying my numbers are inflated and high; They are numbers based on continued lack of effort and proper management by everyone. If people follow the advice of the CDC and healthcare professionals we can lower the curve and minimize the amount of people needing care at the same time.

>  
>“The damages of keeping the economy closed as it is could be worse than losing a few more people,” said Golisano, founder and chairman of the payroll processor Paychex Inc. “I have a very large concern that if businesses keep going along the way they’re going then so many of them will have to fold.”  
>  
>  
>  
>President Donald Trump says he doesn’t want the cure for the Covid-19 pandemic “to be worse than the problem,” and some of America’s wealthiest people and executives are echoing his rallying cry. They want to revive an economy that could face its worst quarterly drop ever -- even if it means pulling back on social distancing measures that public health officials say can help stop coronavirus. These investors aren’t prizing profits over lives, they say, they’re just willing to risk some horrors to avoid others.  
>  
>“You’re picking the better of two evils,” said Golisano, who wants people to go back to their offices in states that have been relatively spared by the coronavirus, but remain at home in hot spots. “You have to weigh the pros and cons.”  
>  
>In New York, where hospitals are at a tipping point and getting pummeled by patients, Governor Andrew Cuomo says the economy shouldn’t be restarted “at the cost of human life” and that he’s developing a plan that “lets younger people get back to work.”  
>  
>  
>  
>  
>  
>The question is when they should do it.  
>  
>Trump, guided by a group of hedge fund and private equity titans, wants the country up and running again by Easter, though public health officials warn that’s too soon for a virus that’s killed more than 18,400 and infected at least 400,000 worldwide. Only companies with less than 500 employees are required to provide paid sick leave for workers out with Covid-19. Economists from Northwestern University calculated that keeping social distancing practices in place until cases decline could save 600,000 lives nationwide.  
>  
>Read also: Here’s What It Would Take to Get the U.S. Economy Back to Work  
>  
>Lloyd Blankfein, who ran Goldman Sachs Group Inc. until 2018, helped kickstart the calls to get back to work on Sunday when he tweeted that “extreme measures to flatten the virus ‘curve’” were sensible “for a time” but could crush the economy: “Within a very few weeks let those with a lower risk to the disease return to work.”  
>  
>His longtime deputy, Gary Cohn, who left the bank to become Trump’s top economic adviser, asked if it was time “to start discussing the need for a date when the economy can turn back on.” Without clarity, businesses “will assume the worst,” he said.  
>  
>Tilman Fertitta, owner of Golden Nugget casinos and Bubba Gump Shrimp, is calling on authorities to let businesses reopen at limited capacity in a couple of weeks to avoid a long economic disaster. Fertitta, who also owns the Houston Rockets and is worth $3.2 billion, said his company is “doing basically no business.” His demand goes against a school of thought that says prematurely reopening the economy could kill more people and eventually cause more economic harm.  
>  
>Billionaires and other members of the elite have the luxury of social distancing while making money. The ones who want workers back in their jobs say they’re aiming to stop millions from suffering for years and falling further into debt. Officials are trying to accomplish that by restricting foreclosures and allowing Americans to defer mortgage payments.  
>  
>“It’s outrageous,” said Robert Reich, who was labor secretary for President Bill Clinton and now studies public policy at the University of California, Berkeley. “It is absolutely necessary to shut down the economy so that millions of people don’t die. For the privileged among us to fail to see that and to give the economy precedence over this public health emergency is morally reprehensible.”  
>  
>The push to restart the economy makes a certain amount of sense to rich people, according to Reich, because they have come to expect disproportionate gains as the system’s top winners. “The one flaw in their logic this time is that the coronavirus doesn’t understand class,” he added. “The more people are in infected, the more likely it is that Blankfein and other billionaires will become infected as well.”  
>  
>Jim Conway was a server in an Olive Garden in Pennsylvania until it closed about two weeks ago. He’s been out of work and isn’t getting paid while his application for unemployment benefits gets processed.  
>  
>  
>  
>“Being an older worker, I’m in no hurry to go back in the middle of an epidemic,” Conway, 63, said. “Being a server means you’re in contact with lots of different people, and puts you at bigger risk of getting infected. I’m kind of glad they closed when they did.” He wants the outbreak under control before the restaurant reopens, but worries that politicians and businesses tend to focus on their bottom line before people like him.  
>  
>“They’ve never really had our interests at heart,” he said. “And now would be a weird time to start.”  
>  
>One of those government officials, Texas Lieutenant Governor Dan Patrick, said on Fox News that Americans should get back to work and let “grandparents” take care of themselves.  
>  
>Dick Kovacevich, who ran Wells Fargo & Co. until 2007, wants to see healthy workers below about 55 or so to return to work late next month if the outbreak is under control. “We’ll gradually bring those people back and see what happens. Some of them will get sick, some may even die, I don’t know,” said Kovacevich, who was also the bank’s chairman until 2009. “Do you want to suffer more economically or take some risk that you’ll get flu-like symptoms and a flu-like experience? Do you want to take an economic risk or a health risk? You get to choose.”

The Robert-Koch-Institut recommended that people only get tested, if they show symptoms **and** you've been to a risk area in the past 14 days **or** you've had contact with a confirmed corona case in the past 14 days [Source: German Health Ministery](https://www.bundesgesundheitsministerium.de/fileadmin/Dateien/3_Downloads/C/Coronavirus/BMG_BZgA_Coronavirustest_Plakat_barr.pdf)

According to this morning's press conference from the RKI, another reason for the low death rate may be that the amount of older people that have been infected in Germany is very low, compared to other countries. 

However, don't get me wrong. I approve absolutely of the RKI's strategy in containing the virus (also I'm no expert, so I listen to experts) and I'm glad that we have rational and reasonable people in places of power."

Terminal lucidity, rally before death or end-of-life rally, refers to an unexpected return of mental clarity and memory, or suddenly regained consciousness that occurs in the time shortly before death in patients suffering from severe psychiatric or neurological disorders. This phenomenon has been noted in patients with schizophrenia, tumors, strokes, meningitis, Parkinson's disease, and Alzheimer's disease.It may be present even in cases of patients with previous mental disability. There are two subtypes: one that comes gradually (a week before death), and another that comes rapidly (hours before death). The former occurs in the majority of cases.

Man Suspected of Planning Attack on Missouri Hospital Is Killed, Officials Say
According to officials, the man had expressed racist and anti-government sentiments.

By Adam Goldman
* 		March 25, 2020Updated 8:16 p.m. ET
    * 		

A man suspected of planning to attack a Missouri hospital was killed during a shootout with F.B.I. agents, the authorities said on Wednesday.
The deadly encounter took place on Tuesday afternoon in suburban Belton, Mo., after agents on a tactical team tried to arrest the man as part of a domestic terrorism investigation.
It was not clear whether the man was killed by F.B.I. agents or died by suicide. He was taken to a hospital, where he was pronounced dead. Officials identified the man as Timothy R. Wilson, 36.

According to officials, Mr. Wilson had expressed racist and anti-government sentiments. He had been under F.B.I. scrutiny since September, and the authorities said that at one point he had considered attacking multiple targets, including a school with a large number of black students, as well as a mosque. 
“Wilson considered various targets and ultimately settled on an area hospital in an attempt to harm many people, targeting a facility that is providing critical medical care in today’s environment,” the F.B.I. said in a statement.
Last week, Belton’s mayor issued a stay-at-home order for its residents. Authorities said Mr. Wilson said he felt compelled to act because of the mayor’s order and intended to use a car bomb to cause mass casualties. 
The F.B.I. is reviewing the shooting, as is standard anytime agents are involved in shootings.
As of Wednesday afternoon, there were eight known cases of the coronavirus in suburban areas of Cass County, Mo., which includes Belton. The Belton police have also had to issue a statement about false information on social media.

If you only listened to the media, you'd think this virus was an instant death sentence. However, stats don't support that. According to Gov Cuomo, about 13% of people who need testing end up in the hospital, 3% the ICU, across all age groups. This is saying nothing about individuals who had such mild symptoms they were never tested. In a study of elderly passengers on the Diamond Princess cruise ship (median age = 68), 73% of those infected were asymptomatic or mild.

The fact is, the vast overwhelming majority of people who contract this virus will be just fine. However, when you see endless headlines like ""39 year old dies of coronavirus"" you tend to overestimate the risk."

That's Senator Lindsay Graham expressing the concerns that a lot of Republicans have over providing immediate unemployment insurance to people who lose their jobs due to the coronavirus outbreak.

This is INSANITY. Small business are closing in mass. Large business outlets are shuttering to the public. As many as 30% of people could be out of work within the next month. And Republicans like Graham are afraid of ""incentivizing unemployment""? Unemployment is here, you heartless bastards, and it's come to millions of people who were doing everything you could ask to stay employed just 2 weeks ago.

I'd like Senator Graham to tell any of the thousands of families who are watching their cupboards go bare while the checking account drains as rent and mortgage payments gobble it up and no money comes in that, while he'd love to help them put food on the table, he just can't allow them to get too comfortable not working.

This is an outrage. People are going to be desperate, and for reasons they have no control over. What is the fucking point of unemployment insurance if we can't offer it to people that a global pandemic puts out of work? And of course, Senator Graham was perfectly happy to support provisions of this package to provide cash bailouts to major industry like oil producers and airlines. He's never worried about incentivizng them to fail. Just regular people like us."

Unfortunately, it’s mostly sadness right now, but that is a massive improvement compared to the emotionless husk that I’ve been for the past 6 months.

The only difficulty I am having during this pandemic is that my therapist is on medical leave and closed their office for the time being. Even if I had the energy to start with a new therapist, I am not interested in doing phone sessions. Things are not terrible for me, but I am starting to notice the lack of perspective that my therapist was able to provide for my thoughts and feelings.

Lately I have been wondering whether I actually enjoy any of my hobbies or I just use them to escape the reality that my social and romantic lives have been complete failures. I’m about to turn 30 and I have zero friends, have never had any kind of romantic experience, and am not emotionally close to my family.

I have noticed that I only enjoy doing things that can keep my mind completely focused. Nearly all my free time goes into video games, though I do also play a musical instrument. I can’t stand reading books, but I do listen to a lot of audio books while my hands are busy such as during exercise, cooking, or cleaning.

Related to the previous point, I am completely unable to relax. I am not anxious or anything, I just can’t get any enjoyment out of passive activities. I never watch TV or movies, not because I find the content boring, but because they don’t capture my full attention the way video games do. I live in a cold area and a lot of people around me love to go someplace warm on a winter holiday. The idea of wanting to lie on a beach or lounge at a pool for hours on end is completely alien to me. I wouldn’t go even if you were paying me to do so.

I have been successful enough that I am financially secure and have multiple years of living expenses saved up on top of large contributions to my retirement accounts. This is mostly because I never spend money on anything. My single largest expense is rent and the second is therapy followed by food at a distant third. Winning the lottery wouldn’t change anything since I work to pass the time rather than because I need the money.

The coronavirus quarantine hasn’t affected me at all. The only difference is that now I sit in front of a computer at home to do my job instead of sitting in front of a computer at my company’s office. I guess it’s nice that I can wear comfortable clothes while I work.

I have noticed a lot of benefits from going to therapy, though it can be a frustratingly slow process sometimes. I’m confident that I will eventually get better, but I am worried about finding a place to fit in. People my age and older are already settling down and having kids. I can’t relate to people younger than me and guys in my situation are a prime target for ridicule. I also can’t imagine a woman in her 30s wanting to be the first one to hold my hand, let alone everything else.

This is already longer than I expected it to be. If you’d like to do me a favor, please stop making fun of guys who can’t get laid. Except incels. Fuck those hateful idiots."

No enforcement of anything.

It’s a total joke that “social norms” are the reason for Japan’s success battling the virus (so far) and a damn miracle that things haven’t gotten worse (yet?). Because as far as I can see, the average person doesn’t give two shits about social distancing, the average business doesn’t give a shit about doing extra sterilization, taking extra precautions, etc. In fact, aside from the missing tourists and the canceled baseball games, an outside observer might wonder if we’re even in the middle of fighting a pandemic at all."

Jan. 22: “We have it totally under control. It’s one person coming in from China. We have it under control. It’s going to be just fine.” — Trump in a CNBC interview.

Jan. 30: “We think we have it very well under control. We have very little problem in this country at this moment — five — and those people are all recuperating successfully. But we’re working very closely with China and other countries, and we think it’s going to have a very good ending for us … that I can assure you.” — Trump in a speech in Michigan.

Feb. 10: “Now, the virus that we’re talking about having to do — you know, a lot of people think that goes away in April with the heat — as the heat comes in. Typically, that will go away in April. We’re in great shape though. We have 12 cases — 11 cases, and many of them are in good shape now.” — Trump at the White House. (See our item “Will the New Coronavirus ‘Go Away’ in April?“)

Feb. 14: “There’s a theory that, in April, when it gets warm — historically, that has been able to kill the virus.  So we don’t know yet; we’re not sure yet. But that’s around the corner.” — Trump in speaking to National Border Patrol Council members.

Feb. 23: “We have it very much under control in this country.” — Trump in speaking to reporters.

Feb. 24: “The Coronavirus is very much under control in the USA. We are in contact with everyone and all relevant countries. CDC & World Health have been working hard and very smart. Stock Market starting to look very good to me!” — Trump in a tweet.

Feb. 26: “So we’re at the low level. As they get better, we take them off the list, so that we’re going to be pretty soon at only five people. And we could be at just one or two people over the next short period of time. So we’ve had very good luck.” — Trump at a White House briefing.

Feb. 26: “And again, when you have 15 people, and the 15 within a couple of days is going to be down to close to zero, that’s a pretty good job we’ve done.” — Trump at a press conference.

Feb. 26: “I think every aspect of our society should be prepared. I don’t think it’s going to come to that, especially with the fact that we’re going down, not up. We’re going very substantially down, not up.” — Trump at a press conference, when asked if “U.S. schools should be preparing for a coronavirus spreading.”

Feb. 27: “It’s going to disappear. One day — it’s like a miracle — it will disappear.” — Trump at a White House meeting with African American leaders.

Feb. 29: “And I’ve gotten to know these professionals. They’re incredible. And everything is under control. I mean, they’re very, very cool. They’ve done it, and they’ve done it well. Everything is really under control.” — Trump in a speech at the CPAC conference outside Washington, D.C.

March 4: “[W]e have a very small number of people in this country [infected]. We have a big country. The biggest impact we had was when we took the 40-plus people [from a cruise ship]. … We brought them back. We immediately quarantined them. But you add that to the numbers. But if you don’t add that to the numbers, we’re talking about very small numbers in the United States.” — Trump at a White House meeting with airline CEOs."

Kingston is a nice town that is just small enough to be nice and just small enough to be missing a few things.

I've been here on and off (mostly on) since 1980 and will leave in a pine box (hopefully not soon :) ).

It isn't the easiest place to travel out of comparably. Via is unreliable, flights are unreliable, driving is a fair distance. I mean in terms of the convenience of being close to a major airport, for example. 

Kingston rent situation wasn't great - a lot of Torontonians were moving here for retirement and buying up places, plus the inevitable BNB BS. We'll see how that plays out with a few months of Coronavirus. 

The University is going through some rather significant issues right now, and will likely see some significant changes, so I'd guess that some things (e.g. work from home ratio long term) will be adapted.

What's True

During a Feb. 28, 2020, campaign rally in South Carolina, President Donald Trump likened the Democrats' criticism of his administration's response to the new coronavirus outbreak to their efforts to impeach him, saying ""this is their new hoax."" During the speech he also seemed to downplay the severity of the outbreak, comparing it to the common flu.

What's False

Despite creating some confusion with his remarks, Trump did not call the coronavirus itself a hoax.

People are always expecting a crash and large price drops. If this doesn't crash the market, nothing will, and honestly it's not even looking like it will be super significant. In my opinion, it's a PAUSE. there will be few sales and very low activity for 3 months probably, maybe longer. but price cuts won't be drastic, and when they are, it will be the minority. people always under estimate how much money is in van, how non desperate homeowners are, how many homeowners have family with money, tons of equity, multiple property. that's why there are not generally significant price drops, not enough people are forced to take a loss in any situation. it will be interesting to see how this plays out but my BET is significantly decreased activity for 3 - 6 months with 15 - 20% possible drops, but more than price drops, lack of sales.

I promise you there are A LOT of very rich people happy to scoop up vancouver real estate should prices decrease below a certain threshold or dramatically. a 500k condo isn't going to become 250k and a million dollar one 500k... even in these crazy times, they would fly off the shelf. you can still get multi offers if you list below market value now.

again, the biggest affected portion will be ultra luxury, over 2 mill ... 5 mill. yes these drop easier and harder. the ""affordable"" stuff for us normies won't change much.

we already had the foreign buyers tax, the insurance crisis, now coronavirus, a million other things... if vancouver real estate can sustain, there's no stopping it.. whenever this is all over it will boom again, probably in 2021 or 2022. this is all just my personal opinon of course."

What stood out to me about this modeling from Marc Lipsitch and others at Harvard was that, unlike the doomsday Imperial College model, it actually took into account both seasonal effects on COVID-19 transmission and the probability of critical care capacity being increased over time.

The conclusion:

>One-time social distancing efforts will push the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic peak into the autumn, potentially exacerbating the load on critical care resources if there is increased wintertime transmissibility. Intermittent social distancing can maintain critical care demand within current thresholds, but widespread surveillance will be required to time the distancing measures correctly and avoid overshooting critical care capacity. New therapeutics, vaccines, or other interventions such as aggressive contact tracing and quarantine – impractical now in many places but more practical once case numbers have been reduced and testing scaled up (20) – could alleviate the need for stringent social distancing to maintain control of the epidemic. In the absence of such interventions, surveillance and intermittent distancing may need to be maintained into 2022, which would present a substantial social and economic burden. To shorten the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic and ensure adequate care for the critically ill, increasing critical care capacity and developing additional interventions are urgent priorities."

1 - Gilead was able to apply for orphan status not because they applied before there were 200,000 cases, but because there’s a loophole which allows companies to apply for this if there are more than 200,000 cases and there’s an “unmet need”. From [Ars Technica](https://arstechnica.com/science/2020/03/no-a-biotech-hasnt-used-loophole-to-lock-down-coronavirus-drug-yet/): “When we say ""rare disease,"" it's generally accepted that this means a condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States. Obviously the predictions for COVID-19 are for many times that number—it's a pandemic, after all. However, the Orphan Drug Act does have an exception for more common diseases with unmet needs. So the FDA is allowed to consider granting orphan drug status to a treatment for ""[a] disease affecting over 200,000 persons in the US, but for which there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making available a drug for such disease will be recovered from sales in the US."" It's this provision that Gilead used with its remdesivir orphan drug application.”

2 - Just a little while ago Gilead rescinded their application for orphan drug status. Also from Ars Technica: “Gilead has submitted a request to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to rescind the orphan drug designation it was granted for the investigational antiviral remdesivir for the treatment of COVID-19 and is waiving all benefits that accompany the designation. Gilead is confident that it can maintain an expedited timeline in seeking regulatory review of remdesivir, without the orphan drug designation. Recent engagement with regulatory agencies has demonstrated that submissions and review relating to remdesivir for the treatment of COVID-19 are being expedited.”"

A) All at-risk individuals self-quarantine.

While this coronavirus is new, coronoviruses in general are not and have been well studied.  The general assumption is immunity conferred upon recovery.  The reason we can't say for certain is the time to study and lack of serology tests.  But it's likely."

Thanos was purely Malthusian, the snap would be “dispassionate”, and “affect rich and poor alike”. The reason why coronavirus-based eco-fascism is more objectionable is because the people who would die if we let covid run rampant in the name of cleansing the Earth are the poor, the sick, and the elderly. Wealthy people who have salaried positions and can work from home are not as vulnerable. They can afford to stock up on food, have large savings, have jobs where they can work from home, gain access to top quality healthcare, etc."

Your speculation pretty much fits the account of a priest from Nembro, the worst-affected Italian town.

>Cella – underlining that he is not a doctor and that he doesn't wish to overstep his mark – limits himself to chronicling the facts that have devastated his community: “We believe this thing has been around since the beginning of the year or even since Christmas, without being identified. For a start, the nursing home in Nembro had a peak of anomalous deaths: in January, 20 people died of pneumonia, the last one, this week, was the chairman of the Giuseppe Pezzotta Foundation, affectionately known as Bepo.

>“The whole of last year, there were only seven deaths there. And so the number of funerals began to swell, week in, week out, with everyone talking about this severe pneumonia going around. Before Mardi Gras, half the town was in bed with fever. I remember that while we were discussing whether to hold the celebrations and the parade with the children, we had to close down the ‘homework space’ because most of the volunteers who supervised the kids were sick. But there was no talk of coronavirus back then in Italy. Who knows how many of us were already sick and then got better."

A California social media prankster claims he was hospitalized with the coronavirus — just days after posting a video of himself licking a toilet bowl for a nauseating online challenge.

“I tested positive for Coronavirus,” the 21-year-old from Beverly Hills tweeted on an account that has since been suspended, the outlet reported.

It comes just two days after the prankster, who goes by the social media handle GayShawnMendes, posted a video himself on Friday running his tongue across a public toilet as part of a bizarre — and widely criticized — “Coronavirus Challenge” on social media.

The craze — seen mainly on TikTok, a video-sharing platform — spurs users to post footage of themselves licking everything from toilets to grocery store produce."

My place of work is owned by a mega corporation and they have provided all employees with a letter to provide to anyone that attempts to stop us from coming to work and, they left us with a warning. Under no circumstances is sick time allowed unless you have the coronavirus. Under no circumstances will they allow us to close our doors. Even if you test positive for the flu, you must come into work. If you do not, your employment will be terminated.

They claim it's all because of some emergency rules put in place so no business goes bankrupt. And if we don't like it, quit. But, it's obviously just rich fucks taking advantage of the situation, like they always do. Your life is less important than their already unimaginably sized wealth.

Or ""pack churches""--nevermind the First Amendment violation there, good luck with that when none other than *Pope Francis* has shut down the largest single Christian denomination in the country until further notice.

You see this with the Bros, too. They're utterly convinced that if he Bernie were president right now, he'd use the crisis to issue sweeping, legally binding diktats about the following: universal basic income, universal Medicare, total overnight student loan forgiveness, guaranteed employment, abolish rent, abolish mortgage payments, abolish credit card payments, I've even seen Bros claim he'd totally eliminate *parking fines*. The last one really blows apart their claim to be the Proletariat or whatever--if you represent the poor you'd be for free mass transit, dickheads, not a parking ticket bailout. Having that as your goal doesn't say ""champion of the working class"", it says ""I'm a dude who is rich enough to own a car in a major city, but park like a dickhead, and am also too cheap to pay the fines.""

Bernie himself seems to be under this delusion, too--sitting in his living room surrounded by sycophants, issuing potemkin ""orders"" to Congress that wouldn't get anywhere even if he *were*  president--he really think he'd be like a prime minister and just get whatever he wants passed with a majority cause he says so!

Before you spread false information, look at the science on this from multiple sources.  We DO know that catching SARS did not give people permanent immunity to SARS.

I just replied to someone who was lying about SARS and saying people who had SARS were immune for 12 years afterwards (and that this virus could be the same).  That is patently false about SARS.

They argued a proposal to add $600 per week to unemployment insurance for up to four months, a core provision of the near-final legislation, could encourage companies to lay off workers and Americans to stay unemployed, urging a vote to cap the aid.

I actually don’t know if coronaviruses in general mutate rapidly or not, but if they do, isn’t there a possibility that we would need to be vaccinated more frequently for it?

Edit: did some research, turns out this virus doesn’t mutate very much, which bodes well for retaining immunity: 

> There are only about four to 10 genetic differences between the strains that have infected people in the United States and the original virus that spread in Wuhan, he said. “That’s a relatively small number of mutations for having passed through a large number of people,” Thielen said. “At this point, the mutation rate of the virus would suggest that the vaccine developed for SARS-CoV-2 would be a single vaccine, rather than a new vaccine every year like the flu vaccine.

And comparison to flu: 

> Neuman contrasted the coronavirus with influenza, which is notoriously slippery. “Flu does have one trick up its sleeve that coronaviruses do not have — the flu virus genome is broken up into several segments, each of which codes for a gene. When two flu viruses are in the same cell, they can swap some segments, potentially creating a new combination instantly — this is how the H1N1 ‘swine’ flu originated,” Neuman said.

(1) The “cure” to the economic issues is not “opening” the country, which is largely not shut down, it is to focus efforts and energy on solving this health issue.  That does not mean a shutdown/quarantine.  It also does not mean movie theaters and sports events at this time. The world is largely shut down - made in America issues aside, our economy relies on them in large part too. Focused efforts on a health remedy are what is needed.

(2) The loss of more life will impact families who relied on the deceased for income.  This is a real economic impact to many. 

(3) The car accident/fatality risk argument is ridiculous - about 35k people die of car accidents in the US each year - this virus is expected to vastly surpass that. 

(4) The real risk is to our healthcare system. If that system fails, the economy will fail - regardless as to whether we are “open for business,”

(5) This is not an either-or issue. Talking heads make it seem so, but you can have an economy while mitigating the virus’s effects.

Edit:  I forgot to add - it’s heartless."

>During the press conference, Protezione Civile officials were asked to clarify what the ""change in active cases"" (""incremento delle persone attualmente positive"") really represents, after our website had raised the issue of Italian media reporting the change in active cases (a lower number) rather than the change in total cases (a higher number), incorrectly representing it as ""newly infected"" when, in fact, it represents the ""change in active cases""

>Newly infected, meaning the number of people who have tested positive to the virus in the last day, corresponds to the number Worldometer has always reported, which is the change in total cases in accordance with the international standards set by the WHO and followed by all countries.

This coronavirus strain (which is not the flu, by the way) is very easy to spread, days before you show any symptoms you can spread it. And it is 10 times more deadly than a normal flu. So instead of 1 death per 1000 cases, it is 10 per 1000 or 1 in 100.

And the older you are, the deadlier it is. For the young, there may be mild or almost no symptoms, and then they hug Grandpa who ends up in ICU. If they have room.

Possible motive? President Trump has refused to use a wartime law to require major manufacturers to make vital equipment to combat the new coronavirus, reportedly after corporations successfully lobbied his top adviser and son-in-law, Jared Kushner.

Another possible reason: Thus far, the Trump Organization, run by the president’s adult sons, Eric and Donald Trump Jr., have closed properties in Doral, Florida, Las Vegas, Ireland, Scotland, Bedminster, New Jersey, and Palm Beach, Florida, the home of Mar-a-Lago. According to the Post, those hotels and clubs represent six of Trump’s top revenue-producing businesses, bringing in about a collective $174 million per year, or $478,000 per day.

""If the number of actual infections is much larger than the number of  cases—orders of magnitude larger—then the true fatality rate is much  lower as well. That’s not only plausible but likely based on what we  know so far.

Population samples from China, Italy, Iceland and the U.S.  provide relevant evidence. On or around Jan. 31, countries sent planes  to evacuate citizens from Wuhan, China. When those planes landed, the  passengers were tested for Covid-19 and quarantined. After 14 days, the  percentage who tested positive was 0.9%. If this was the prevalence in  the greater Wuhan area on Jan. 31, then, with a population of about 20  million, greater Wuhan had 178,000 infections, about 30-fold more than  the number of reported cases. The fatality rate, then, would be at least  10-fold lower than estimates based on reported cases.

Next, the northeastern Italian town of Vò, near the provincial  capital of Padua. On March 6, all 3,300 people of Vò were tested, and 90  were positive, a prevalence of 2.7%. Applying that prevalence to the  whole province (population 955,000), which had 198 reported cases,  suggests there were actually 26,000 infections at that time. That’s more  than 130-fold the number of actual reported cases. Since Italy’s case  fatality rate of 8% is estimated using the confirmed cases, the real  fatality rate could in fact be closer to 0.06%.""

He’d Always Been Thundercat, Whether He Knew It or Not
The bassist and singer Stephen Bruner invites listeners into his eccentric world. His new album, “It Is What It Is,” is a vivid portrait of living with uncertainty and grief.

The bassist and singer Thundercat’s latest album, “It Is What It Is,” is a meditation on living with loss partly inspired by the death of the musician’s friend Mac Miller.

March 25, 2020, 10:24 a.m. ET

OAKLAND, Calif. — In a few hours, Stephen Bruner, the singer and bassist professionally known as Thundercat, had a sold-out show to play at the Fox Theater, a former 1920s movie palace on Telegraph Avenue. Somewhere inside the Fox, there was a dressing room with his name on it. But Bruner’s plan for the afternoon was to stay on the bus, where he feels at home.

“I’m a road dog,” Bruner said, then corrected himself. “Cat. Road cat.”

He was half-prone on a couch in the bus’s back corner, in skinny black jeans and a T-shirt proclaiming, in bumper-stickerish terms, his love of a particular excretory function; his nails were painted eggplant purple. A screen near the bus’s ceiling displayed a game of Mario Kart, on pause. Every so often, to keep from losing his place in the game, Bruner would stretch out a silver-socked toe and wake the console from sleep mode by nudging the stick of his controller, which lay at the far end of the couch, next to an Aldi shopping bag overflowing with crumpled laundry, including a silver Lurex cargo vest designed by Virgil Abloh for Louis Vuitton.

Anything else he could have needed in this moment was close at hand — water, plastic-sleeved X-Men comics, a reference book on an obscure genus of Pokémon, or a Pikachu-shaped backpack with a miniature Pikachu hanging from the zipper and a Pikachu-yellow sweatshirt inside.

Bruner, 35, cheerfully acknowledges never having put aside his childhood obsessions. Instead, he’s become the kind of artist who invites listeners into a private and eccentric world. Since 2011, he’s made four solo albums, always in collaboration with the Los Angeles producer Steven Ellison, better known as Flying Lotus. (The latest, “It Is What It Is,” is out April 3.) His catalog posits an alternate universe where smooth ’70s FM stalwarts like Kenny Loggins and Michael McDonald (who both appeared on his third album, “Drunk,” in 2018) stand shoulder to shoulder with jazz icons like John Coltrane and the Weather Report bassist Jaco Pastorius — and where music built on those juxtapositions somehow resonates as pop.

Policy: 

**GRADING POLICY CHANGE**: In any course (or activity, regardless of type) for which the Law School grants credit in the Spring 2020 semester, credit will be awarded exclusively on a CREDIT/FAIL basis according to our existing requirements for such credit, regardless of whether any student in that course has elected to be graded on that basis.  All letter-grade requirements are waived and thus deemed satisfied by a grade of CREDIT in a Spring 2020 semester course. 

* **PROGRAMS AND COURSES AFFECTED:** The policy change applies to Spring 2020 semester courses in the J.D. program, the LL.M. programs, and the MSL in Tax.  The policy does not apply to the MSCRS program or to Spring 2020 courses in which grades have already been awarded.
* **APPLICATION:**
   * Whether or not a student has been enrolled in any course on a CREDIT/FAIL basis, the CREDIT/FAIL grading in Spring 2020 shall not count against any student’s maximum number of permitted CREDIT/FAIL courses.
   * All transcripts will be annotated to indicate that Spring 2020 grades reflect NYU Law’s policy in response to the public health crisis caused by the coronavirus rather than the choices of any individual student.
   * Grades for Spring 2020 shall not figure in any student’s cumulative grade point average, nor shall they be calculated toward any end-of-year rankings or Law School honors.
   * Year-long clinics will still award grades for the Fall components of those clinics.  
* **EXCEPTION:** There may arise a limited number of special circumstances in our LL.M. and other graduate programs requiring case-specific treatment.  An ad hoc review committee will be convened to consider petitions from students with special circumstances, such as issues relating to minimum grade point average graduation requirements."

If we do manage to shut stuff down enough to slow current growth rates - now the highest in the world - then we're going to be in lockdown that much longer. The peak dying is going to happen in May either way, but there is simply no way on Earth that *any* state is able to responsibly administer a bar exam come July.

Also, to answer the question in your second most recent post:  South Korea handled coronavirus properly.  China did so eventually, as well, although I like the idea of following their example much less than the idea of following South Koreas (which was much more compatible with a democratic society).  We're richer and have far more resources than South Korea, and the fact that Trump didn't take the threat seriously for two months during which we should have been preparing is *absolutely* something we can fault him for.  Remember that even small decreases in the effectiveness of our response are compounded by exponential spread, and it's very hard to argue that Trump wasn't at least a little less effective than Clinton would have been or Biden or Bernie would be."

The authors first did genetic comparisons between Sars-Cov, Sars-Cov-2 (the pandemic coronavirus), Mers-Cov as well as a few more strains. 

Knowing that, then they created the ""interactome network"". To put it simply, take the known Spike protein of Sars-Cov-2. The Spike protein allows the virus to attach itself to human cells and penetrate them. In order for the virus to ""find"" the human cell it interacts with a protein that the human cells have. The Sars-Cov-2 Spike protein interacts with a protein known as angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). The Mers-Cov Spike protein interacts with another human protein known as dipeptidyl-peptidase 4 (DPP4). Through this direct interaction, the virus attaches itself to human cells, penetrates them and replicates. This of course is just one direct interaction between virus proteins and human/host proteins. They did the same for all proteins and they found all the interactions, direct and indirect, and thus they created the ""interactome network"".

Then they used computers to study the effect 135 drugs have at the ""interactome network"" or in other words the interaction between virus and human proteins. Logic dictates that disrupting that interaction the virus will not be able to survive, replicate etc. Take for example the aforementioned Spike protein and angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). If we were to disrupt their interaction, the Spike protein will not attach itself to human cells and the virus won't be able to ""find"" and enter the human cell. As such, it won't be possible for it to replicate. 

Since this is a network they could find notable ""junction""/points of the network. Logic dictates that these proteins (either human or virus) are more important, as such drugs targeting them will be more efficacious. Some of these targets are deemed ""targetable"" and other ""non-targetable"", for various reasons, let's not delve into that. The point is that if we choose a ""targetable"" protein that is a key point at that network we have better chances at beating the virus.

These 135 drugs of course are approved drugs with a known safety profile. Taking an approved drug, that is in circulation, with a known safety profile and trying to find new use for it (aka to treat another disease with it) is called repurposing. Normally the drug development process lasts 10-15 years. We don't have 10-15 years!! So, we have to make due with drug repurposing. Since these drugs are approved, with a known safety profile, we do not need to do clinical trials for them in order to prove their safety. We already have done that! So, all we need to do is to do clinical trials in order to prove their efficacy for each disease we want to treat. In this case Covid-19.

Since the coronaviruses that they studied are not one strain, they found ""targetable"" proteins that are ""key junctions of the network"" that either are common between all/most strains or they are specific for a strain.

From the initial 135 drugs they ended with 16 drugs that they propose that should be studied further. These 16 drugs are ""Selective estrogen receptor modulators"", ""Angiotensin receptor blockers"", ""Immunosuppressant or antineoplastic agents"" and ""Anti-inflammatory agents"".

Lastly, since they have that interaction network, they propose 3 combinations of drugs in order to be able to interrupt as much as possible of that interaction network. What is better than targeting one ""targetable"" protein that is a ""junction"" at that interaction network? But of course to target as many as possible of those ""targetable"" proteins that are a ""junction"" at that interaction network."

I've watched live streams before.  I know how they're supposed to look.  It says ""Live"" and the bar at the bottom is completely red while it's live.

What I noticed about Joe's ""livestream""  was that it DID NOT say LIVE and the bar at the bottom was white.

The dead giveaway is that during this airing, you already knew that the entire segmnt was going to be 32:41.  If it were truly live, you wouldn't know exactly how long the segment would be until it was over.

I took **[this screenshot at 5:35 pm](https://imgur.com/kxgCl60)** - eleven minutes in.  See the 32:41 at the far right side of the white bar?  This was pre-recorded.

During the ""live stream"" there were all kinds of technical problems.  For one thing it was totally out of sync at times in the first 15 minutes.  You could hear the person on the other end of the line asking their question, but on the screen you culd just see Biden talking away (although there was no sund coming from Biden.)  

At other times, Biden was answering the question, but his lips weren't moving at all.  It was a friggin' disaster.

Apparently after it was supposedly over, they fixed the synchronization, so it looks normal now.

Also there was a question from someone and iden said I'm assuming you're between the ages of 18 and 30 and the guy said he was 18.  During the so-called ""live tream"" that question and Biden's answer were played TWICE.  That's been fixed now, too.

Biden's bad enough, but his campaign staffers or whoever set this up are equally as bad as Biden.

Canada shipped tons of PPE to China during their crisis. Now China is hoarding their production to restock themselves first.

> You might have seen this coming and stocked up, but blaming governments for the shortage that the Coronavirus has caused is a bit ludicrous.

Blaming consumers is ludicrous as well. Store-bought masks were not supplied through the same distribution lines than those of hospitals, so the few masks sitting on store shelves for months weren't going to make much of a difference. 

Now that they're blaming consumers, there is a prejudice against wearing a mask in public. The truth is, once the masks become abundant, **everyone should wear masks in public**.

>  back in January and February, the vast majority were expecting another SARS or H1N1-level of a pandemic, where maybe two or three people in a given city are infected and the general public doesn't have much in the way to worry about.

>We also wouldn’t be in this position if the Chinese govt hadn’t tried to silence any news circulating about this corona virus including from doctors within Wuhan. 

That's the thing with authoritarianism. Because there is no democracy, information must be tightly controlled. Otherwise there is panic. However, authoritarian government and good control of information allowed them to contain the virus relatively quickly once they got going.

The initial suppression came from the Wuhan provincial level. Once the national government got involved, their response was very different. Control measures were put in place. Scientists started work. The WHO was engaged. Information was passed out.

The Chinese were responsible for most of the early information about the virus, a lot of which has proven to be correct. We still don't trust a lot of it (I believe we're relying on information coming out of South Korea and Italy at the moment). Even if they'd been totally open, would we have trusted what they said? Probably not.

Racism doesn't work on a rational level, and blaming ""the Chinese"" and calling it ""the Chinese virus"" [results in racist behaviour](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/23/us/chinese-coronavirus-racist-attacks.html). Perhaps save it for after the crisis is over? When we don't have millions of scared people who feel helpless and looking at assign blame?"

They will be rounding errors: a distorted function of how much we were looking and where.

The flu causes up to a billion cases each season.  Some years, more (H1N1 in 2009, for example).  In the United States, it's anywhere between 45-60 million infections, 83% subclinical or asymptomatic, and influenza runs its course for about 4-5 months.  A majority of the cases happen within an even tighter time frame.  Each individual strain of the flu typically peaks and recedes even faster than looking at them in aggregate.

We have consistently been told that this is not the flu because it is way more contagious.  Indeed, research points to an R0 of ~3 for coronavirus vs. ~1.5 for the flu.  R0 isn't the only thing that matters, of course.  However, it makes no logical sense that the flu can deal 500-600k deaths in a year (mostly in the Northern hemisphere and mostly in the winter months) and tally ~1 billion infections, but the SARS-CoV-2 which has existed for at least 4 months is comparatively such a chump.

Of course, I understand that it takes a new virus some time to get going.  The flu gets a head start each year, no doubt.  But, still, it's obvious that we've had at least two months of community spread—COVID19 outbreak—in so many places that the scope cannot be ignored.

What does the flu, with its comparably low R0, do in its first two months every year?  Why would we ever think that a few hundred thousand cases is remotely close to the truth?"

Clark  County Commission Chairwoman Marilyn Kirkpatrick said that she is  anticipating more than a billion dollar loss in her county, which  includes Las Vegas, in the coming months as businesses have to close  their doors to tourists. 

According  to Kirkpatrick, hundreds of thousands of workers have been laid off in  recent months as the state scrambles to mitigate the spread of the virus  while implementing emergency economic measures.

A  number of county leaders pointed to how expensive it is to transition  essential government workers to a ""work from home"" solution.

2020-03-25,nicereddy,neoliberal,7,https://www.reddit.com/r/neoliberal/comments/folv0u/discussion_thread/flh3g3m/,"From the WaPo live blog:

A $2 trillion stimulus deal reached in the Senate early Wednesday includes $400 million in assistance for states to prepare for 2020 elections amid the risk of disruption by the coronavirus pandemic — far less than Democrats said would be necessary.

The money will funnel through the federal Election Assistance Commission, and states will be required to report how they will spend it “to prevent, prepare for, and respond to coronavirus.”

The text of the package, obtained Wednesday by The Post, does not include mandates Democrats had hoped to impose on states in exchange for the money, including offering all voters mail-in ballots and, if an election is held during a national emergency, sending a mail-in ballot to every registered voter.

Republicans had balked at mandates in part, they said, because elections should be administered by the states. Democrats argued that the mandates were necessary to ensure equal access to the polls during the pandemic.

Many states are already gearing up to expand absentee-voting programs, but the magnitude of the task varies by state. Only five states — Utah, Hawaii, Colorado, Oregon and Washington — conduct elections primarily via mail-in voting.

One-third of states allow absentee balloting only for a reason, such as travel or illness.

Democrats had estimated that preparing for November’s elections — and the remaining primaries — would cost states billions. Printing absentee ballots and envelopes, paying for postage and buying high-capacity scanners are among the expenses state and local governments face.

1. Calling it ""[name of outbreak city which is now automodded] Virus"" is not inherently racist in the slightest. Just like ""Ebola,"" novel diseases are often named after the outbreak area. Many well meaning people called it ""[automodded city] Virus"" without any racist intent before the virus received its scientific name SARS-CoV-2 which is a mouthful. ""Coronavirus"" is scientifically nonspecific.  

2. HOWEVER, ""[name of country] virus"" or ""[name of outbreak region] virus""  may become ***emergently racist***. Think of what happened to the ""Okay sign."" When something is appropriated by racists it also becomes imbued with their intent. Similarly, people should not amplify those terms ANYMORE if they are now being appropriated by Donald Trump to shift blame for his failed government to [automodded country].

3. More importantly, the USA should be concerned about the geopolitical fallout of this rather than the tit for tat between USA and [automodded country]. Initially this outbreak was a huge blow to the government of that country, however now it is becoming clear the USA will have it ***worse.*** This plays into the entire geopolitical argument of **Atlanticisim vs Eurasianism** - with the Eurasians insisting that a nondemocratic managed technocracy produces better outcomes than a free society indirectly led by public opinion, and this crisis, if we're honest, playing entirely into the hands of that argument. In addition the Western media has done a TERRIBLE job of informing Western citizens much less the globe of the failures of [that country's] initial response, including how it first came to the government's attention when a doctor used the flagged word ""SARS"" to discuss the pneumonias he was seeing in a private doctor chat, resulting in that dr being spirited away by the secret police, and a government crackdown on reporting until the local epidemic became too big to deny. All of the geopolitical advantage has been bungled away by Trump's response as well as the fact that the president of the United States doesn't have the credibility to authoritatively rebut online ""actually America started it"" rumors started by the foreign ministry of [that country].

>Currently there is no evidence of food or food packaging being associated with transmission of COVID-19.  

>Unlike foodborne gastrointestinal (GI) viruses like norovirus and hepatitis A that often make people ill through contaminated food, SARS-CoV-2, which causes COVID-19, is a virus that causes respiratory illness. Foodborne exposure to this virus is not known to be a route of transmission.

>The virus is thought to spread mainly from person-to-person. This includes between people who are in close contact with one another (within about 6 feet), and through respiratory droplets produced when an infected person coughs or sneezes. These droplets can land in the mouths or noses of people who are nearby or possibly be inhaled into the lungs. It may be possible that a person can get COVID-19 by touching a surface or object that has the virus on it and then touching their mouth, nose, or possibly their eyes, but this is not thought to be the main way the virus spreads. However, it’s always critical to follow the 4 key steps of food safety—clean, separate, cook, and chill – to prevent foodborne illness."
2020-03-25,ChunkyArsenio,Conservative,7,https://www.reddit.com/r/Conservative/comments/fok97y/wsj_editorial_board_from_shutdown_to_phase_two/flfn3f4/,">  **Article:**

Our editorial last week on the costs of our government-mandated national economic shutdown struck a chord with readers, including perhaps at the White House. President Trump is now saying he wants the country back to normal by mid-April. While this is right as a direction, the shift to a sustainable health and economic strategy will require a transition and a credible explanation to the public.

The initial 15-day national period of mass social distancing ends Monday, which is a chance for reconsidering the anti-virus shutdown strategy. The challenge will be finding a balance between protecting against the virus and resuming commerce and business that is crucial to getting people back to work.

The current at-home quarantines across the country are buying time to slow the coronavirus spread, as well as to surge masks, protective equipment and ventilators to hospitals and hot spots. This hospital surge is crucial to saving lives and reassuring the public that America’s cities aren’t on a path to Italy’s scenes of tragic triage. New York, Seattle and perhaps New Orleans will have to cope in coming days and weeks with hundreds and perhaps thousands of critically ill Covid-19 patients. Americans will want to know how a sustainable strategy prevents similar scenes around the country.

Mr. Trump and other leaders will also have to be candid about the limitations of what we know. Because of the lack of widespread testing, we don’t know how many people are infected with few or only mild symptoms. This information would help us get a better fix on the real death rate, not least by group and health status, and thus to know how under siege our hospitals will be over weeks and months. More accurate testing data will also reassure the public.

Some degree of social distancing and self- or mandated quarantines will also have to continue. This is especially true for the elderly and those who are immuno-suppressed. The public education on those points can’t let up.

The health experts will have a vital role here, especially when it comes to different distancing regimes by region or by demographic group. The public-health goal is to limit the virus spread now and later this year if there is still no vaccine or better treatments. The public-education goal is to assure Americans that we can reduce the virus threat even as millions of Americans return to work.

***
But sooner rather than later, Mr. Trump and governors will have to explain the huge human and economic cost of continuing the shutdown. Those costs will start to appear Thursday when initial jobless claims are likely to record one of the biggest one-week leaps in history. They will rise by the millions as the shutdown goes on.

Congress may ease some immediate pain if it passes the Senate’s $1.8 trillion spending bill this week, but no amount of public money can compensate for the trillions of dollars in lost private employment and production. Low-income workers who had recently begun to see wage gains will suffer the most. These workers need employers back in business and finding customers and revenues again. Government loans can only maintain these businesses for so long, and even then they will burden the companies with more debt for years.

The human cost will be the greatest. The economic and social-science literature is replete with studies that document the harm to people from recessions and economic hardship—including higher rates of suicide, opioid abuse, alcoholism and domestic violence.

A Lancet study found “4,983 excess suicides” between 2007 and 2009 (that is, before and during the recession) based on population and economic data from 2000-2011. A 2013 study in the BMJ medical journal found similar suicide increases, especially in men: “Rises in national suicide rates in men seemed to be associated with the magnitude of increases in unemployment, particularly in countries with low levels of unemployment before the crisis.”

A 2019 study in Clinical Psychological Science found “individuals who had experienced even a single financial, job-related, or housing impact during the recession still had higher odds of symptoms of depression, generalized anxiety, panic, and problematic substance use 3 or 4 years after recession had ended.” And a St. Louis Federal Reservestudy in 2013 found that drug-abuse rates were 10 points higher among the unemployed.

***
None of this will surprise readers who have watched friends or loved ones spiral down after a bankruptcy or job loss. The point here is that the policy tradeoff for Mr. Trump and the governors isn’t between saving lives and a higher stock market, as our editorial’s critics asserted. And it isn’t a choice between pandemic expert Anthony Fauci and economists in the White House. There is great public-health damage from both the virus and from mass unemployment and recession.

The challenge for political leaders is to consider both and make decisions in the larger national interest. This is what Mr. Trump means when he tweeted Tuesday, in his unsubtle fashion, that “We can do two things together. THE CURE CANNOT BE WORSE (by far) THAN THE PROBLEM!”

The urgent choice isn’t pitting public health against financial health. Both matter, and the latter is essential to the former. The country needs a sustainable strategy for both."

Were you aware of either of these things? It's important to remember that attacks don't necessarily come directly from your campaign account, they can come from the personal ones of you and your campaign team, which you are still accountable for.

Problem is that CDC is run by a quack. Other groups do not believe this is just going to disappear in May.

Robert Redfield (dir. of CDC) has a long history of objectively poor judgement when in a position to respond to an epidemic. From an NYTimes article on Redfield when he was appointed director of CDC:

>In the early 1990s, Dr. Redfield was the subject of a military investigation after colleagues suspected that he overstated the therapeutic effects of an experimental AIDS vaccine at presentations and in a report. The investigation led to a correction in some published data, according to documents.

>Several high-level colleagues, however, felt the military should have been tougher on Dr. Redfield, who they felt raised false hopes about the efficacy of a treatment vaccine he was developing. At the time, Public Citizen’s Health Research Group sued to gain the records, and made them public.

>In a 1992 letter to Col. Donald Burke, the director of the division of retrovirology, Major Craig W. Hendrix, director of the Air Force HIV program, wrote that the credibility of the military’s efforts on retroviral research was at risk and under scrutiny. “Severe, painful steps must be taken less we dishonor the honest labors of so many colleagues and patients within our research consortium. We cannot continue to deceive.”

>In an interview Tuesday, Dr. Hendrix, now a professor at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, recalled the incident, which he now uses as a case study in ethics. “The facts didn’t line up,” Dr. Hendrix said. “I can’t know if it was intentional, but I think every scientist has to be the most skeptical of their own data, and the most careful, because nobody else will have all the raw data.”

>In the letter Senator Murray wrote to President Trump, she mentioned the Army investigation, which criticized Dr. Redfield for a faulty analysis of vaccine trial data, and premature presentation of the information.

>“This pattern of ethically and morally questionable behavior leads me to seriously question whether Dr. Redfield is qualified to be the federal government’s chief advocate and spokesperson for public health,” Senator Murray wrote.

Beyond being investigated for fishy info used to support a bogus vaccine... Inside the army he promoted programs that tested and dishonorably discharged soldiers.

>The military seemed intent on administratively punishing infected soldiers for their HIV status. Soldiers described being summoned to meet with a chaplain, who would inform them that they had tested positive for HIV, and counsel them while military police rifled through their barracks searching for evidence of homosexuality and the names of possible sex partners.

The result of this policy often included humiliation, homelessness, and suicide.

He also worked with ASAP, an ultra conservative Christian group, supporting the position AIDS was god’s judgment. Redfield and ASAP supported H.R. 2788, a bill proposing to forced-testing is citizens for AIDS. The testing program would remove the professional licenses of those caught with the disease and force them into quarantine. The bill was put forward by William E. Dannemeyer, who supported a similar policy in California called Proposition 64.

He was with ASAP against basic measures like access to clean needles, free condoms, or working to diminish the stigma associated with being gay, calling such policies ""false prophets."" All of these public health policies - although shown to be effective - were against his Christian values. ""Redfield named the breakdown of family values and increasing number of single-parent households as key factors responsible for the spread of AIDS.""

After his AIDS positions in the 90s received investigations, he left to work with AIDS groups in Africa, eventually being reappointed to run government programs by bush in the 2000s. They were basically Christian initiatives promoting abstinence. The ABCs of AIDS: Abstinence, be faithful, use a condom. So he did eventually move towards protection, but their emphasis on Christian values undermined effective policy in many people’s eyes.

Since the beginning of the COVID-19 outbreak, the CDC has been criticized for their role in the American response. This includes mailing out faulty tests that then had to be recalled. America is still testing below expectations, with the total tests to date lower than most developed nations daily testing numbers. In fact, Seattle doctors discovered their outbreak in part by ignoring CDC’s regulations restricting testing.

The current model being referenced by Dr. Fauci and driving the change in policy by the UK (and trump until the weekend) showed the infections would peak over the summer.

With that being said, it’s important that people know this because you have to open a claim and make sure that you’re using that resource. This can be a huge help for those who have limited insurance or no insurance in the workplace. You will be able to receive payment from missed work and all of your medical care will be covered. Also, and I hate to say this, but if you were to die from the virus, your family would be entitled to a payout from the insurance company because of that.

Edit: So I also wanted to add, like someone said below, this wouldn’t apply to the first person who is confirmed. It would only be a possibility for those affected afterwards. I’m talking to my wife now who’s confirming this but also saying it’s on a case by case basis as long as it can be determined that it was contracted in the workplace which would generally mean that someone else was already confirmed to have it. This is only to let people know that if they do get sick and they think it was from work, checking in with workers comp might be a good idea. The worst they can do is deny you but if they approve you, it’s a huge weight off of your shoulders."

As noted above, the RBD of SARS-CoV-2 is optimized for binding to human ACE2 with an efficient solution different from those previously predicted[7](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0820-9#ref-CR7),[11](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0820-9#ref-CR11). Furthermore, if genetic manipulation had been performed, one of the several reverse-genetic systems available for betacoronaviruses would probably have been used[19](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0820-9#ref-CR19). However, the genetic data irrefutably show that SARS-CoV-2 is not derived from any previously used virus backbone[20](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0820-9#ref-CR20). Instead, we propose two scenarios that can plausibly explain the origin of SARS-CoV-2: (i) natural selection in an animal host before zoonotic transfer; and (ii) natural selection in humans following zoonotic transfer. We also discuss whether selection during passage could have given rise to SARS-CoV-2.

Now, this morning, a ""correction"" was issued and the number of cases in Coweta County is apparently only still at 10, while the number of cases in district 4 is only 76.

I noticed a similar irregularity in neighboring Carroll County. The City Menu (a local paper run by UWGA alumni in Carrollton) reported yesterday that Tanner Health System has had 60 positive COVID-19 tests, yet according to an article by the Newnan Times-Herald, DPH is still reporting that Carroll County only has 27 cases.

Even weirder, after the Coweta County coroner a few days ago announced that the 42 year old health care worker tested positive for COVID-19 and had no pre-existing conditions, Piedmont Healthcare is now calling this case ""inconclusive.""

I'm still coughing. I'm still exhausted. I get out of breath with mild exertion.



Hospital policies are going to be the thing that kills us, because they're the thing that will keep infections going around: healthcare workers with mild symptoms will be denied testing and time off, and will subsequently spread the virus to their coworkers, their patients, and the general public (they'll still have to go to grocery stores and gas stations, just like non-healthcare workers)."

My “treat” is that I lost eight hours a week and instead am working 32 vs the usual 40. No difference in pay or benefits. 

But on a more serious note, I am quite pleased with how it’s been handled from my employer’s end. I work as armed security for a casino in Las Vegas. All non-essentials were shut down several days ago, but we can’t very well leave a property worth $300mil unprotected. 

Our owner (privately owned by a single person, btw) fired every part time employee, but gave them three weeks full time pay when he did so. He also extended their benefits for an additional month after their termination (if they worked enough to qualify to begin with). We had about 500 part time employees at the time of our closure. 

Every single full time employee, whether or not they are essential for the closure, was retained. This is approximately 2-2.5 thousand people that still have a job even though the casino itself is closed. If you’re essential to the closure, you come in and work. In exchange, we get paid for 32 hours a week, we accrue PTO time, we get fed two free meals per shift from a restaurant on property (were practicing social distancing there) and we have access to the gift shop on property that is stocked with food items that would otherwise go bad during the closure (produce, milk and eggs, etc etc). We’ve all maintained our healthcare benefits and can continue depositing money into our 401k.

If you’re not essential to the closure, our employer is paying you to stay home. For zero work whatsoever, you receive a 32 hour paycheck and get to maintain your benefits. Employees not working during the closure dont accrue PTO time and they don’t have access to the food during shift or the groceries at the gift shop but they’re still getting paid. 

Furthermore, if an essential employee is sick or exhibits ANY signs of the Coronavirus, they’re instructed to stay home and they’ll still receive pay during that time, WITHOUT having to use their PTO. 

I went into as much detail about it here as I did because I’m still at a loss that a man who owns a business designed to take money from other people is being so generous to his employees. He’s BY FAR breaking the mold of the industry standard here in Las Vegas, he’s making me proud to say I’m employed by him, and it’s giving me a new “look on life” working for him."

2020-03-25,cvdailyupdates,Coronavirus,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/fos8s5/icelands_mass_testing_finds_half_of_carriers_show/flhfyyj/,"This isn't as big of a deal as it sounds. 

""Multiple strains"" just mean viruses with at least one point mutation difference from each other. There's about 30,000 letters in the coronavirus genome. ""A new strain"" means that one of those letters changes. The overwhelming majority of these single changes don't have any effect on the outcome of the disease.

If you were infected with one strain vs two strains, it's going to be basically the same from the perspective of your body. One single point mutation is not going to cause any difference in the behaviour of the virus (well, say, 0.00001% chance it will, there are no certainties). It's still going to be a virus with the same proteins and the same structures that your immune system can still target using the same antibodies. 

If you're infected with 'one strain', maybe your body starts out with 100 viruses, and then they double and double and double and double some more and then you end up with (I have no idea if this is a realistic number) 1 trillion virus particles infecting your body. If you're infected with 'two strains', that just means that 50 of the starting viruses are strain A and 50 are strain B, and you end up with 500B of strain A and 500B of strain B. It's not like you have ""twice as much virus"" or ""twice the infection"" or whatever, because your body is using the same mechanism to fight off both of them. If it was possible for two strains to cause twice as much infection, then one strain would also be able to grow to that level of infection in your body before it got fought off. 

For that matter, the only place these viruses can reproduce is inside human cells, and the only time mutations happen is when they reproduce. Someone who is 'infected with two strains', for all we know, he was infected with one strain, and then _a mutation creating a new strain_ happened inside his body, and that's the source of the second strain infection. 

TLDR: being infected with two strains vs being infected with one strain is basically no difference because _**ALMOST**_ always the new strain is functionally identical to the old one and your body fights them both off at the same time in the same way"

2020-03-25,Sartevscamus,unpopularopinion,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/unpopularopinion/comments/fo5wif/coronavirus_mega_thread/flhokcr/,"(Based on a recent business insider article and the CDC stats they used)

The rate of infections AND fatality rate is highest among older Americans (fatality rate in parenthesis)

22.3 cases per 1 million people 85 and older (10.4%)
13.6 cases per 1 million people 75-84 (4.3%)
13.4 cases per 1 million people 65-74 (2.7%)
10.1 cases per 1 million people 55-64 (1.4%)
10.3 cases per 1 million people 45-54 (0.5%)
6.5 cases per 1 million people 20-44 (0.1%)
1.5 cases per 1 million people 0-19 (0%)

2018 population by age group in US:
0-18: 24%
19-25: 9%
26-34: 12%
35-54: 26%
55-64: 13%
65+: 16%

So here's some food for thought: 

71% of the population is under 55. The fatality rate of coronavirus is 0.5% among a subset of that population, with the fatality rate dropping to 0.1% (the fatality rate of the flu) among 35% of the population. 

In terms of basic public health and common sense, the focus needs directed at the 29% of the US population that is actually at risk. One could argue that policies should ONLY apply to those 65+, which encompasses only 16% of the population but is accounting for 80% of fatalities and has an insanely higher infection rate. 

It's far easier to focus policy on 16%-29% of the US population than the entire population. Many people 65+ are retired and don't work. Structure delivery set up services and isolate them from the public until there is a vaccine. 

No need to isolate the healthy when it's very clear this virus is far more dangerous for certain populations.  

The repercussions of shutting down so many sectors and aspects of the economy is going to have lasting effects, which is likely to hurt people under 40 more (student loans for instance). 

It's easier to create effective public health policies that don't count on everyone isolating. I don't think we could every truly stop a disease like COVID-19 from spreading unless we have an immunity to it or have a vaccine. 

Test everyone who works with people 50+. Focus on that population because the death rates and infection rates are incredibly higher at this stage. These numbers are early so they may be inflated in some aspects. 

People are going to end up sick no matter what we do. Some will die. This is not a Trolley problem scenerio and nobody is considering the best for the most policy. 

The people most at risk also don't make up the majority of the workforce. 

It's just not practical to try to get everyone to be submissive to policies that clearly are focused on protecting a very specific portion of the population. 

Numbers will change but we should be adapting based on them to a strong degree. 

And we're simply not discussing the fact that in America, the most common causes of death are lifestyle related. 

It's incredulous that we have to flatten the line because we invested in sports stadiums and other silly things instead of hospitals and medical supplies. 

But if supplies are limited, focus on protecting the disease from spreading to people who are most likely going to need a ventilator. 

Young people are going to have to absorb the debt caused by a $2 trillion stimulus package more so than anyone. By young I mean 40 and under. But these shutdown are hurting that group more than anyone. 

This is screwing over the majority instead of remembering when this COVID 19 ends, life is going to go forward. Someone is on the hook for putting money back in to the economy and it's going to be the people who are going to live another couple of decades. 

Target shelter in place ONLY for high risk people, specifically 65+. Allow the rest of the population to continue making money, which is what pays taxes that are going to go towards the debt this nation is accruing. 

Create localized traveling medical teams to check on older patients and connect them with the area on aging and social services to ensure their needs are 100% met. Teach some older folks how to video chat. Make sure they have opportunities to socialize. 

Hunker them down until progress is made and the fatality rate will trend downwards."

João Amoêdo, one of his political adversaries during last elections, called for his resignation

The press - directly attacked during the speech - destroyed him in all ways and forms.

The President of the Lawyer's Order, a very strong and influent institution in Brasil, classified the speech as ""one of the most dishonest political speech in history.""

So, yeah, I think it's safe to say he's done.

EDIT: yes, most of his supporters are over 60. The zealots still support him, others shifted completelyz saying he lost it. I would say his supporters are divided, but pending more strongly against him.

EDIT 2: just to add on the matter, the Army Commander, few minutes after the speech said that the ""Coronavirus is the most important crysis of this generation"". Interpret that however you want."

Because of those words from the fucking president himself, a large group of people still dont take this virus and this situation seriously. They still think its overblown, that its overreaction, that it will blow over like sars did or that its just like a normal flu its nothing serious.

This isnt a runny nose and some sneezing thing, if you catch the worst of it, you feel like you're choking for air while simultaneously aching all over your body, dehydration, confusion, headaches. 

Most experts and nations expect upwards of 70% of the global population to be infected if people dont take it seriously.

That is **5.4 Billion** Humans.

Out of those its expected 20-30% will need/seek hospital care and be admitted (CDC Figures).

That means **1.08 Billion - 1.62 Billion** humans will need hospital care. (you can probably add another 20-30% who will go to the hospital seeking care but turned away as they dont need to be admitted and can recover at home)

While between 5-10% will need intensive care. (based on extrapolated data from confirmed cases vs those that get intensive care)

> About 80% of deaths and 45% of hospitalizations for COVID-19 in the U.S. are among adults aged 65 or older, with the risk of serious illness and death increasing with age, according to a report released today by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The findings are similar to data from China, the agency said. While severe COVID-19 illness leading to hospitalization can occur at any age, children appear to have milder illness, with almost no hospitalizations for those under age 19, CDC said. According to the report, an estimated 21% to 31% of U.S. COVID-19 patients between Feb. 12 and March 16 were hospitalized, with 5% to 12% admitted to an intensive care unit. An estimated 1.8% to 3.4% of U.S. COVID-19 patients died over the period. [source](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/69/wr/mm6912e2.htm?s_cid=mm6912e2_e&deliveryName=USCDC_921-DM23064)

thats between **270-540 Million people needing intensive care**.

If this pandemic continues to be disregarded as it is, it will lead to the amount of people infected at the same time growing far beyond the capacity and resources available.

To emphasize lets look at the US statistics.

If we use USA as a example with 70% infection rate, that would mean 230 Million Americans will get the Covid-19 Virus.

Out of the 230 Million, 20-30% will be admitted into hospital care (CDC). 

= **46-70 Million Americans will require Hospital Care.**

Currently the US has only [924,107 staffed hospital beds](https://www.aha.org/statistics/fast-facts-us-hospitals) TOTAL.

and statistics show already the hospitals have a **[occupancy rate of 65%.](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/hus/2017/089.pdf)** 

Meaning that out of the 1M hospital beds, on average, 600,669 Hospital beds will already be in use by other patients for other illnesses and issues. Which leaves only

924,107 - 600,669 = **323,437 available hospital beds.**

Heck **IF EVEN ONE %** of those infected require intensive care in the US at the same 2 week period, thats going to be almost 500,000 people needing hospital beds where there are only 300,000 available.

AND to make matters worse, this is all disregarding the amount of hospital workers/suppliers/producers doctors,nurses, emergency responders who will also be affected by Covid-19.

Even rich people wont all have access to the same resources. They can try to self-isolate on their mansions and such, but this is a very infectious virus, to put it in a simple way. In a normal flu, you have a infection rate of 1.35. Meaning you infect that many people they infect that many people and so on, if you do so for 10 steps, you end up with around under 100 people infected. The Covid 19 virus on the other hand, it has a infection rate of 2.4. Which means by 10 steps you would have upwards of 60,000 infected.

**That is why its important that everyone stay inside so that this virus can go through the world gradually and hopefully minimize the infection rates and eventually be vaccinated against and die off.**

Recommendation from the CDC;

> The risk for serious disease and death in COVID-19 cases among persons in the United States increases with age. Social distancing is recommended for all ages to slow the spread of the virus, protect the health care system, and help protect vulnerable older adults. Further, older adults should maintain adequate supplies of nonperishable foods and at least a 30-day supply of necessary medications, take precautions to keep space between themselves and others, stay away from those who are sick, avoid crowds as much as possible, avoid cruise travel and nonessential air travel, and stay home as much as possible to further reduce the risk of being exposed (7). Persons of all ages and communities can take actions to help slow the spread of COVID-19 and protect older adults.†

> Recent modelling of the basic reproductive number (R0) from Italy estimate
R0 between 2.76 and 3.25. Researchers from Lombardy who analysed the early phase of the outbreak in their

findings from China. A recent review of 12 modelling studies reports the mean R0 at 3.28, with a median of 2.79.
R0 is proportional to the contact rate and will vary according to the local situation. Further research is needed to
get a more accurate estimate of R0 in the various outbreak settings [23]

If that is correct and the infection rate is at near 3, then this pandemic is even more so important to take seriously."

📷 [Data](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wuhan_Flu/search?q=flair_name%3A%22Data%22&restrict_sr=1)

**TLDR:   IF you're a healthcare worker, or you know one and their employer was  too stupid to prepare with proper full PPE, advise them to GTFO.  High  viral load exposure = far worse outcome.  This is why 29 year old  doctors are dying.**

*Healthcare   workers will certainly be the worst affected members of society  outside  of the Elderly due to their exposure to high viral loads (and  trash  PPE):*

Why?  The  severity  of this virus depends on the exposure to the viral load.  So  someone  taking a shit in a public restroom, and having fecal viral  particles  enter through their arsehole, will have much more mild  symptoms than a  doctor or nurse, wearing crappy PPE (BC the US  goverment has better  things to do than prepare for a highly likely  pandemic as has been  predicted for decades).

So  these  heathcare workers with their shit PPE that the US goverment  couldn't  figure out how to stockpile, will get MASSIVE viral loads.

**Many  healthcare workers will develop double pneumonia and die, or if they  are given a ventilator, they will survive, only to endure lingering  neurological, cardiological, and respiratory damage, possibly the  permanent loss of smell.  This in addition to chronic fatigue, inability  to exercise, and a virus literally just resting within the brainstem  neurons, waiting...waiting until you think you're safe, have a late  night out, don't get a lot of sleep - and BAM back with the fucking  Wuhan coronavirus round #2.**

So,  the healthcare industry in general, is massively fucked.

**Personal  advice?  If you have proper PPE, then by all means, apply it correctly  and do your duty.**  However, if you are being asked to do ANYTHING  without full PPE, GTFO, and GTFO quickly.   Is it really worth your life  and your chronic damage because your employer was too stupid to prepare  for a pandemic that was predicted decades ago ?  Time to bug out,  healthcare workers - the shit is hitting the fan.

RIP Healthcare workers, it was a profitable industry while it lasted.

“When we have lots of folks coming up from the Front Range into the mountains, that flies in the face of everything we’re trying to accomplish”

By John Meyer, The Denver Post Mar 23, 2020, 4:19 pm
Peru Creek, a popular backcountry area for skiing and snowshoeing near Keystone, was inundated by users this past weekend. (Provided by Julie Sutor, Summit County communications director)
Summit County, which has had nine confirmed cases of coronavirus, is urging non-resident recreationists to stay away while encouraging its residents to exercise outside.

“We’re doing everything we can to slow the spread of (the coronavirus), and when we have lots of folks coming up from the Front Range into the mountains, that flies in the face of everything we’re trying to accomplish,” said Julie Sutor, Summit County director of communications. “We don’t want people to come here. We heard from the governor that everyone in the state needs to be conducting social distancing to the greatest extent possible, and the longer we prolong the outbreak, the longer we will be suffering the health and economic impacts of the novel coronavirus.”

Sutor said she doesn’t have the numbers to indicate how many visitors recreated in Summit County over the weekend.

Summit County recognizes the value of its residents getting outdoor exercise, Sutor said, as both Gov. Jared Polis and Denver Mayor Michael Hancock have emphasized. But there are also reasons to recreate closer to home.

“Having people cross county lines and having the opportunity to spread the disease from one person to the next is exactly the opposite of what we need Coloradans to be doing right now,” Sutor said. “We are not discouraging Summit County residents from getting outside and exercising. It’s good for their physical health, it’s good for their mental health, and we know there are lots of Summit County residents who are doing that within county lines in a responsible way and maintaining appropriate social distancing. We think that is a great thing for them to be doing.”

All Colorado ski areas are closed by executive order of Gov. Polis, and Summit County’s four ski areas — Copper Mountain, Breckenridge, Keystone and Arapahoe Basin — have banned uphill skiing. The Loveland ski area in neighboring Clear Creek County had hundreds of uphill skiers over the weekend, parking on shoulders of U.S. 6.

“I haven’t seen this myself, but I have heard people describe what was happening at Loveland ski area as a conga line going up the hill,” Sutor said. “That is certainly not appropriate under the circumstances. All the ski areas in Colorado are closed down for the purpose of reducing the spread of coronavirus among individuals.”"

“Mayor Bowser Orders Closure of Non-Essential Businesses

Tuesday, March 24, 2020
New Mayor’s Order Requires Temporary Closure of Non-Essential Businesses and Prohibits Gatherings of Ten or More People
(Washington, DC) – Today, to mitigate the spread of the coronavirus (COVID-19), Mayor Muriel Bowser issued Mayor’s Order 2020-053: Closure of Non-Essential Businesses and Prohibition on Large Gatherings During Public Health Emergency for the 2019 Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19). This Mayor’s Order requires temporary closure of the on-site operation of all non-essential businesses and prohibits gatherings of 10 or more people.

The intent of the Order is to temporarily cease all non-essential business activities, including tour guides and touring services; gyms, health clubs, spas, and massage establishments; theaters, auditoriums, and other places of large gatherings; nightclubs; hair, nail, and tanning salons and barbershops; tattoo parlors; sales not involved in essential services; retail clothing stores; and professional services not devoted to assisting essential business operations.

The Order goes into effect on March 25, 2020, at 10 pm, through April 24, 2020.

>Sen.

>The plan would vastly ramp up “extended benefits,” the long-neglected part of the UI system mentioned above that is already part of the unemployment insurance law, and adds emergency money during large downturns. Bennet’s plan would fully federally fund the program, taking pressure off states, and trigger extended benefits automatically when the unemployment rate spikes, or if it ever exceeds 6.5 percent. **It would set benefits to 100 percent replace wages, up to a maximum level (set at 80 percent of the median wage) during public health emergencies like the coronavirus.**"

If we worship the virus it will go away and will never attack us again because there is no point in infecting your worshippers. So let's all agree that corona virus is god and then we won't get it. If you don't join you will get corona. The cult is called the coronavirus cult. This may be the only way to stop it. 

How do we stop it?

Well since Covid-19 started from bats so it would stand to reason that the opposite of bats will be the cure. What is the opposite of bats you ask, well obviously snakes are. Snakes are scaly whereas bats have fur, bats can fly but snakes don't even have legs, snakes use infrared vision but bats use hearing to locate things. So the solution is to start killing snakes and eating them, however, most people don't want to eat snakes so how do we get them to consume them? Simple, we grind up the snakes into a paste or even oil type substance and we sell that snake oil to the public and cure everyone of Covid-19."
