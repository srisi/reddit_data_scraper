There was a lab close by, and China absolutely did let SARS out of a level 3 lab in the 70's (and avian flu two years later!). The origin of NCoV has shifted from snakes, to bats, to pangolins, and apparently back again to bats in two months.


Also, as far as we know, patient zero did NOT have a wet market connection (several early patients didn't).


They arrested EIGHT doctors for ""spreading rumors."" They arrested ground reporters (one of them is missing, and we will probably never hear from Chen again. We won't hear from Dr Li, either, because he died of ""pnuemonia with broken rib complications."")

I however, do not agree with a few things people tend to throw into this. I don't think it targets Asians (it just broke out in an area that has like, a 98% Chinese population. Of -course- that's who is currently getting infected), and I don't think it was released on purpose.


I think somebody in that lab was infected via accidental PPE breach and this incubates long enough to get past any tests done on said worker.


That said, the whole world is gonna have to deal with this, regardless of where it came from"

The Epoch Times is a news site run by Falun Gong, which is anti-Communist Party of China (yay, that parts good!), but is kind of a weird cult, whose leader, Li Hongzhi, thinks people can levitate, has some very unfortunate views on mixed race people, and doesn't believe in evolution. That's not CCP lies about them, that's from Li Hongzhi's writings and interviews. Oh, and he thinks aliens are meddling in human affairs.

Considering Falun Gong doesn't believe in evolution and thinks quite poorly of science, it's kind of ironic that they have a science section, and feel like they can give someone with no academic affilitation the title of 'senior US scientist'.

Falun Gong are just trying to get a jab in at the CCP, and they don't give a toss about scientific credibility in the process.

Don't get me wrong - CCP are horrible and there's a lack of credible data about what's going on in China right now, but the Epoch Times are not the most trustworthy source right now, especially when it comes to science."

Epoch Times is run by Falun Gong, which on the bright side is stridenly anti-CCP (a great thing!), but also kind of crazy, as some anti-communists can be. They're kind of a cult, and their leader thinks aliens are infiltrating society, that mixed-race people should be expelled from society, and that health problems are just spiritual and not physical. This is coming from the group's own materials and not the CCP propaganda against them.

The internet ceased to be any sort of true public square the day Social Media became the medium of choice. In the old days we used platforms like Usenet, the various IRC networks, etc. There was very little censorship, the “net” was often a place of flame wars, rumors, innuendo and many other things. These systems weren’t money makers, in and of themselves, they were merely part of the tapestry of the early internet, often maintained and supported by a combination of volunteers, educational institutions and internet service providers. 

Today, these modern platforms, with all their identity data and infrastructure, with their multitude of modalities and billions of users, are all about money. Most of these systems are nothing more than glorified message boards, but their centralized ownership gives the companies in question massive power, power that runs contrary to the very design and original purpose of a distributed “internet” (it’s purpose and function declared in its very name).

This is why the modern internet has become so insidiously evil; centralized “cloud” providers, which are nothing more than hosting companies attempting to collect as many people’s services, applications and data, as they can. They wrap those services in proprietary interfaces, orchestration tools and abstractions that ensure that the customer is beholden to them, forever. And they collude: from DNS infrastructure to payment systems, they don’t like you, for a reason they all agree upon, and they can shut you down.

There’s nothing cloud about “the cloud”; there’s nothing social about “social networking”; there’s nothing accurate or organic about “search”.

The Internet of 2020 is a technical marvel, but in all the ways that matter, the internet of 1994 was vastly superior. In those days it was actually a medium for information exchange and the free flow of ideas. Today it’s just a series of tubes for delivering NetFlix."

Based on the amount of anomalies added to the virus structure and the statements by Francis Boyle one of the world's experts on Bioweapons and other Taiwanese military experts. Also the fact that China's only P4 lab is in Wuhan. 

I agree that the simplest explanation is the most likely.

It is way more difficult to explain how all these other segments of the virus structure got added naturally somehow, and how the guy that wrote the Bioweapons bill for the US govt is a liar and conspiracy theorist. And that it just so happened to turn up near the only top level biolab in China, than it is to accept the most likely hypothesis which is that it originated in the lab."

Lots of places that serve as voting centers are also the type of place you turn into an overflow ward during a pandemic.

Vote turnout will be depressed as people try to minimize contact, that would normally be very bad news for Democrats, but the virus is far more dangerous to ages 50+, which is most of the Republican party. Those elderly voters might opt to stay home to avoid the risk (or they might be too busy fighting the virus for their lives).

There's also the risk that Trump/the Republicans use the emergency as an excuse to seize power. ""We're cancelling the election in order to prevent the spread of infection"". Alternatively they might seek to manipulate the vote by using the epidemic to disenfranchise populations unlikely to vote for them (e.g. when the Gyms and churches are full of the sick the blue districts just happen to have their polling places moved to very inconvenient places).

There's also the risk that one or both of the candidates contracts the disease on the campaign trail (and remember, almost all of the candidates are over 70). Vice president choices might be taken a lot more seriously this election cycle.

I have no idea what could happen, but if this hits the US I have a feeling that historians will be mentioning the virus whenever they talk about the election."

And I agree. I follow nCoV very closely. I am seeing a shift in statements by officials. Before, it was 'very unlikely,' now it's 'a possibility', soon 'a probability,' and finally, 'hold on to your hats!' 

Largely, I feel people rely less on their intuition and more on the narrative from a person or organization they think has their best interest at heart. What they fail to realize, IMO, is that an organization is looking out for the whole. And while 'the people' are included in 'the whole,' it's unwise to assume 'the people' come first, and even less wise to assume that any one person is included in 'the people.' Because if history tells us anything, in an event such as this, there will be sacrifice."

- Questions like these appear when there are a lot pressure to implement censorship, so I’m pretty sure we’re going to see a lot of it in the coming days, sadly
- Censorship does only drive normal people to more extremist places, so if you want to see those who think that the CCP numbers are fake ending up on conspiracy theories subs with people swearing it’s a bioweapon made by reptilian overlords, fine by me, I guess
- There isn’t a definitive truth. Example, for the 50c army, not trusting the CCP numbers **is** a conspiracy theory, Dr. Li’s claim **were** fake news, and they’re no different from claiming the thing is an American bioweapon made to hurt China
- If you’re going to draw a line in the sand, it means you hold the truth. You can say for example that “refuting CCP numbers is wrong” only when you also have access to the real numbers directly from hospitals. Etc. Where does your unbiased knowledge stop?
- Remember, we are in this situation today **because** moderators took on them to decide what fake news is, banned and censored people like Dr. Li ... I’m sure that most of them were just doing their job without malicious intent, like mods here. We’re supposed to learn from errors, not repeat them.
- This is one of the only thread that gives voice to oppressed Chinese, and spreads some of their videos that are censored by the CCP, and that they took tremendous risks and courage to share. Sad to see them get censored here as well.
- This a “Coronavirus” sub, not a peer-reviewed medical journal. Can’t we have real discussions about this topic, including anxiety and fears? Trying to calm fears by censoring the truth always backfires by the list of trust.

Anyway. I personally don’t see a problem in this thread, a good balance of minority of shills and doomers, and a majority of normal people. Moderation should stick to moderate the discussion and keep it civil outside of personal attacks, and keep harmful content out (like weird treatments that can harm health). But absolutely not try and decide what “truth” is."

Markets, grocery stores, supermarkets, pharmacies, etc. should arrange business hours reasonably, conduct staff diversion, and strengthen risk management and control.  Communities (villages) need to pay more attention to groups such as old, young, and weak, and do a good job in service guarantee.

 IX. Strengthening the awareness of national protection.  Residents must strictly abide by the regulations of wearing masks in public places, reduce outing activities, and refrain from participating in parties and group activities.  Those who do not listen to dissuasion or cause conflicts shall be dealt with seriously by the public security organs according to law.

 X. Strengthen demonstration drive.  Party members, cadres, representatives of the people's congresses, and members of the CPPCC must play a leading role, actively participate in the prevention and control of the epidemic, and drive family members and neighbours to consciously abide by relevant regulations.

   announce.

If you have a fifth of people ending up in critical care there is no doubt that some people in Wuhan died mainly due to not getting on a ventilator in time. The fatality rate could easily spike up or down depending on the day. As of right now the cruise ship in Japan is our best bet at understanding the characteristics of this virus.

And, this study: First Case of 2019 Novel Coronavirus in the United States 

35 year old male - symptom progression day 1-12

https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2001191


On January 19, 2020, a 35-year-old man presented to an urgent care clinic in Snohomish County, Washington, with a 4-day history of cough and subjective fever. On checking into the clinic, the patient put on a mask in the waiting room. After waiting approximately 20 minutes, he was taken into an examination room and underwent evaluation by a provider. He disclosed that he had returned to Washington State on January 15 after traveling to visit family in Wuhan, China. The patient stated that he had seen a health alert from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) about the novel coronavirus outbreak in China and, because of his symptoms and recent travel, decided to see a health care provider....

Given the patient’s travel history, the local and state health departments were immediately notified. Together with the urgent care clinician, the Washington Department of Health notified the CDC Emergency Operations Center. Although the patient reported that he had not spent time at the Huanan seafood market and reported no known contact with ill persons during his travel to China, CDC staff concurred with the need to test the patient for 2019-nCoV on the basis of current CDC “persons under investigation” case definitions.8 Specimens were collected in accordance with CDC guidance and included serum and nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swab specimens. After specimen collection, the patient was discharged to home isolation with active monitoring by the local health department.
On January 20, 2020, the CDC confirmed that the patient’s nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabs tested positive for 2019-nCoV by real-time reverse-transcriptase–polymerase-chain-reaction (rRT-PCR) assay. In coordination with CDC subject-matter experts, state and local health officials, emergency medical services, and hospital leadership and staff, the patient was admitted to an airborne-isolation unit at Providence Regional Medical Center for clinical observation, with health care workers following CDC recommendations for contact, droplet, and airborne precautions with eye protection.

On admission, the patient reported persistent dry cough and a 2-day history of nausea and vomiting; he reported that he had no shortness of breath or chest pain. Vital signs were within normal ranges. On physical examination, the patient was found to have dry mucous membranes. The remainder of the examination was generally unremarkable. After admission, the patient received supportive care, including 2 liters of normal saline and ondansetron for nausea.


On days 2 through 5 of hospitalization (days 6 through 9 of illness), the patient’s vital signs remained largely stable, apart from the development of intermittent fevers accompanied by periods of tachycardia (Figure 2). The patient continued to report a nonproductive cough and appeared fatigued. On the afternoon of hospital day 2, the patient passed a loose bowel movement and reported abdominal discomfort. A second episode of loose stool was reported overnight; a sample of this stool was collected for rRT-PCR testing, along with additional respiratory specimens (nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal) and serum. The stool and both respiratory specimens later tested positive by rRT-PCR for 2019-nCoV, whereas the serum remained negative.

Treatment during this time was largely supportive. For symptom management, the patient received, as needed, antipyretic therapy consisting of 650 mg of acetaminophen every 4 hours and 600 mg of ibuprofen every 6 hours. He also received 600 mg of guaifenesin for his continued cough and approximately 6 liters of normal saline over the first 6 days of hospitalization.


A chest radiograph taken on hospital day 3 (illness day 7) was reported as showing no evidence of infiltrates or abnormalities (Figure 3). However, a second chest radiograph from the night of hospital day 5 (illness day 9) showed evidence of pneumonia in the lower lobe of the left lung (Figure 4). These radiographic findings coincided with a change in respiratory status starting on the evening of hospital day 5, when the patient’s oxygen saturation values as measured by pulse oximetry dropped to as low as 90% while he was breathing ambient air. On day 6, the patient was started on supplemental oxygen, delivered by nasal cannula at 2 liters per minute. Given the changing clinical presentation and concern about hospital-acquired pneumonia, treatment with vancomycin (a 1750-mg loading dose followed by 1 g administered intravenously every 8 hours) and cefepime (administered intravenously every 8 hours) was initiated.


On hospital day 6 (illness day 10), a fourth chest radiograph showed basilar streaky opacities in both lungs, a finding consistent with atypical pneumonia (Figure 5), and rales were noted in both lungs on auscultation. Given the radiographic findings, the decision to administer oxygen supplementation, the patient’s ongoing fevers, the persistent positive 2019-nCoV RNA at multiple sites, and published reports of the development of severe pneumonia3,4 at a period consistent with the development of radiographic pneumonia in this patient, clinicians pursued compassionate use of an investigational antiviral therapy. Treatment with intravenous remdesivir (a novel nucleotide analogue prodrug in development10,11) was initiated on the evening of day 7, and no adverse events were observed in association with the infusion. Vancomycin was discontinued on the evening of day 7, and cefepime was discontinued on the following day, after serial negative procalcitonin levels and negative nasal PCR testing for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus.

On hospital day 8 (illness day 12), the patient’s clinical condition improved. Supplemental oxygen was discontinued, and his oxygen saturation values improved to 94 to 96% while he was breathing ambient air. The previous bilateral lower-lobe rales were no longer present. His appetite improved, and he was asymptomatic aside from intermittent dry cough and rhinorrhea. 

As of January 30, 2020, the patient remains hospitalized. He is afebrile, and all symptoms have resolved with the exception of his cough, which is decreasing in severity.

2020-02-09,true_rt,Coronavirus,11,https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/f1ix7y/more_north_korea_news_what_little_information/fh6ifvb/,"North Korea’s not saying a word about deaths or illnesses from the coronavirus, but the disease reportedly has spread across the border from China and is taking a toll in a country with a dismal health care system and scant resources for fighting off the deadly bug.

One sure sign of the regime’s fears is that it failed to stage a parade in central Pyongyang on Saturday, the 72nd anniversary of the founding of the country’s armed forces. Last year, Kim Jong Un himself presided over the procession that displayed the North’s latest missiles and other fearsome hardware along with goose-stepping soldiers in serried ranks.

This year, nothing about the nation’s nuclear warheads, much less the “new strategic weapon” that Kim has vowed to unveil. Rodong Sinmum, the newspaper of the ruling Workers’ Party, merely cited the armed forces’ supposed success combating “severe and dangerous difficulties”—and said nothing at all about the parade.

But reports have filtered out about Kim’s subjects falling prey to coronavirus despite the country’s decision to seal its 880-mile border with China, most of it along the Yalu River into the Yellow Sea to the west, and its 11-mile border with Russia where the Tumen River flows into the Pacific.


Among the first to report fatalities in North Korea, the Seoul-based website Daily NK said five people had died in the critical northwestern city of Sinuiju, on the Yalu River across road and rail bridges from Dandong, which is the largest Chinese city in the region and a key point for commerce with North Korea despite sanctions.


“Victims had crossed the porous Yalu River border despite orders to cut off traffic from China.”
Daily NK, which relies on sources inside North Korea that send reports via Chinese mobile phone networks to contacts in China, said authorities had “ordered public health officials in Sinuiju to quickly dispose of the bodies and keep the deaths secret from the public.”

The victims had crossed the porous Yalu River border despite orders to cut off traffic from China as the disease radiated from the industrial city of Wuhan where the virus originated in December. As of Sunday, more than 700 people had died inside China.

One of the first patients in North Korea reportedly was hospitalized in Sinuiju “with symptoms similar to a cold and was given fever reducers and antibiotics,” said Daily NK, but the patient died as the fever rose.  Two more patients died two days later in another hospital in Sinuiju and another two in a nearby town.


North Korea’s worries about an epidemic are all the more intense because of its shortage of basic medicine and equipment. As cases mount, authorities are working feverishly to contain a disease that, if unchecked, could undermine Kim’s grip over his 25 million people, most of whom live in poverty worsened by hunger.

“Because health conditions and health care in North Korea are so bad,” said Bruce Bennett, long-time analyst at the Rand Corporation, “they cannot allow the replication process to develop without severe intervention”—that is, they have to take drastic steps to keep the virus from spreading fast.

The country has just streamlined a headquarters to coordinate operations,  Rodong Sinmun reported, marshaling 30,000 workers to combat the epidemic.


Besides blocking international traffic, the North’s Korean Central News Agency reported the headquarters had ordered tests for everyone entering the capital city of Pyongyang by road and for anyone who had traveled outside the country. Foreigners working in Pyongyang, including those with diplomatic missions or non-governmental organizations, were banned temporarily from venturing outside for shopping. 

Even so, with hospitals and clinics largely bereft of needed supplies other than those serving the elite in the capital and elsewhere, a certain desperation was evident in the state media. Rodong Sinmun warned that “the fate” of the country was at stake, according to Yonhap, the South Korean news agency.

“North Korea lacks a vaccine or medical abilities,” said Bennett,”so they have to act by preventing the disease from coming into North Korea.” The point is to “rapidly contain any leakage—exactly what they are trying to do by preventing people-to-people contacts.”

That’s virtually impossible, however, as long as people move illicitly across the border, carrying on low-level commerce in the need to survive a decrepit system. JoongAng Ilbo, a leading South Korean newspaper, cited anonymous source saying that a woman had been diagnosed in the capital and that all those with whom she had had contact had been quarantined.


Unlike in China, North Korea officially has denied any cases while attempting to get people to cooperate in stopping the spread of the disease.  JoongAng Ilbo quoted a North Korean health official, Song In-bom, as having called on North Korean TV for “civil awareness” and unity in dealing with the disease while assuring his audience there had so far been no cases.

“We should expect that the virus would spread rapidly given the state’s inability to contain a pandemic.”
— Victor Cha and Marie DuMond in ‘Beyond Parallel’
“I believe absolutely nothing of what I'm hearing from Pyongyang,” said Evans Revere, a former senior U.S. diplomat who specializes in North Korean issues.

“It simply defies credibility that a country with a grossly inadequate public health infrastructure and a malnourished population, a country that depends on China for some 90 percent of its trade, and a country that had until recently opened itself up to a major influx of Chinese tourists in order to earn foreign exchange has avoided having a lot of victims,” said Revere. “The total closure of the border and other measures Pyongyang has taken reflect a real sense of emergency in the North about the threat.”


In fact, he went on, “I can't help but think it may also reflect panic if the number of patients is growing.”

Indeed, “the coronavirus arguably poses a unique threat to North Korea,” wrote Victor Cha and Marie DuMond of the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington in an article in Beyond Parallel, which is published by CSIS.

“The regime’s relative isolation from the international community hinders the widespread penetration of many diseases from abroad,” they wrote, but “the porous nature of the border with China and frequent travel is a clear vector for the virus’ transmission.” Thus, “If there are reports of the virus inside of North Korea, we should expect that the virus would spread rapidly given the state’s inability to contain a pandemic.”

By now, it may be too late for North Korea to stamp out all signs of the disease.


“Several suspected coronavirus infections have occurred in North Korea even though it shut all its borders,” said Chosun Ilbo, South Korea’s biggest-selling newspaper, citing anonymous sources. “The infections most likely spread through porous parts of the border with China that see plenty of smuggling and other clandestine traffic,” said the paper, reporting suspected cases among those “engaged in smuggling between the North and China.”

“Bottom line,” said Steve Tharp, who’s been analyzing North Korean affairs as both an army officer and civilian expert for many years here, “the coronavirus has tightened up sanctions enforcement more than any other measure over the years because the North Koreans are actually self-enforcing the sanctions, against their will, through the tight closing of their borders in order to save the regime from being wiped out by this human pandemic coming.”

North Korean leaders, said Tharp, “understand very well that this pandemic would rip through their population and be much more dangerous in North Korea than other places because of their inadequate medical infrastructure and the low resistance disease of the general population after so many years of surviving under near-starvation conditions.”"

You want to show the inspector that your apartment is immaculately clean and in great condition to get that deposit back. You put a throw rug over the puke stain and hope for the best.

China is hiding their puke stains."

Many times they have said this is an unknown, it's novel, hence the name.

It's the same kind of hyperbole you would use when someone gives you one day to do something that takes a week. You'll say ""I HAVE NO TIME TO COMPLETE THIS, WHAT THE HELL?!"" You aren't literally saying you have zero time. Just emphasizing that it's not possible to perform the request.

So clearly there are doctors and other medical staff who have died or are sick and quarantined. They are understaffed and overloaded."

2020-02-09,jackryan147,Coronavirus,8,https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/f1ed2k/coronavirus_fatality_rate/fh4or77/,"Excellent question. It seems like you have really hit on something because the survival rate of posts on this topic is less than 24 hours. I agree the correct way to estimate mortality rate is  deaths/(deaths+recoveries)=813/(813+2685)=0.23. But that number is unpalatably high, so they will switch to this calculation method only when they get enough plausible recoveries. Meanwhile, they just need to keep adding 5000 new cases for every 100 deaths to keep deaths/totalCases at 2%. If they run low on new cases, using false positives will do nicely.  False positives eventually become recoveries  unless the patients catch something in the hospital. However, it is worth pointing out that if all of the 6196 live but severe cases die, they will need another 309,800 new cases to keep deaths/totalCases at 2%. So there is quite a drama unfolding in the numbers. The likely event is that they will build camps for ""mild cases"" into which people who unluckily tested positive are forced despite not having symptoms."

>	I am a respiratory doctor of Wuhan University People’s Hospital
and a member of the coronavirus prevention and control expert group
Are you curious?
I am wearing an oxygen mask and I am infected with the virus.
When did it get infected? Who infected me?
This is a difficult question to answer.
Because I have contacted many patients,
because I was in the frantier,
I will definitely be infected and fall down one.
I watched the news this morning.
It was also very urgent.
There were many factors affecting the patient’s illness.
It was not easy to control it. It is still spreading.
And now the people still don’t know much about this.
They have much panic and fear.
As front-line doctors, my friends, I have my own opinions.
It is true that this is the case,
but some things are not necessarily the case.
The final victory is ours, don’t worry.
I will talk about that later. 
I was ill on January 14,
I had a fever of more than 38 degrees (100.4 freedoms)
Everything else was normal,
I didn’t have a runny nose, I didn’t cough,
I belched and farted
Why should I have a physical examination?
Because our departmen had a dinner on Friday 17th,
I realized whether it would be this reason.
So I called our hospital, They immediately gave me a CAT,
And found that my two lungs had problems.
It’s pneumonia
At that time, it wasn’t serious,
there wasn’t asthma, there wasn’t chest tightness,
Only fever,
it was OK the next day, it was OK the third day,
I could walk
After I did the CAT Reexamination,
bilateral lung pathological changes are increasing
That was what I knew already.
After CAT Reexamination,
the condition deteriorated rapidly and I never got up again.
Chest tightness. It’s hard to breathe.
I have to take oxygen.
Each day is heavier than the other.
I didn’t get up for five days.
On the fourth and fifth day, when it was very heavy,
I wondered if I would die.
I guess I have a 30% chance of death.
If I didn’t get better in four or five days,"

This interview of a front line doctor: 
https://www.caixinglobal.com/2020-02-06/reporters-notebook-we-interview-front-line-coronavirus-doctor-101512020.html


And, this study: First Case of 2019 Novel Coronavirus in the United States 

35 year old male - symptom progression day 1-12

https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2001191


On January 19, 2020, a 35-year-old man presented to an urgent care clinic in Snohomish County, Washington, with a 4-day history of cough and subjective fever. On checking into the clinic, the patient put on a mask in the waiting room. After waiting approximately 20 minutes, he was taken into an examination room and underwent evaluation by a provider. He disclosed that he had returned to Washington State on January 15 after traveling to visit family in Wuhan, China. The patient stated that he had seen a health alert from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) about the novel coronavirus outbreak in China and, because of his symptoms and recent travel, decided to see a health care provider....

Given the patient’s travel history, the local and state health departments were immediately notified. Together with the urgent care clinician, the Washington Department of Health notified the CDC Emergency Operations Center. Although the patient reported that he had not spent time at the Huanan seafood market and reported no known contact with ill persons during his travel to China, CDC staff concurred with the need to test the patient for 2019-nCoV on the basis of current CDC “persons under investigation” case definitions.8 Specimens were collected in accordance with CDC guidance and included serum and nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swab specimens. After specimen collection, the patient was discharged to home isolation with active monitoring by the local health department.
On January 20, 2020, the CDC confirmed that the patient’s nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabs tested positive for 2019-nCoV by real-time reverse-transcriptase–polymerase-chain-reaction (rRT-PCR) assay. In coordination with CDC subject-matter experts, state and local health officials, emergency medical services, and hospital leadership and staff, the patient was admitted to an airborne-isolation unit at Providence Regional Medical Center for clinical observation, with health care workers following CDC recommendations for contact, droplet, and airborne precautions with eye protection.

On admission, the patient reported persistent dry cough and a 2-day history of nausea and vomiting; he reported that he had no shortness of breath or chest pain. Vital signs were within normal ranges. On physical examination, the patient was found to have dry mucous membranes. The remainder of the examination was generally unremarkable. After admission, the patient received supportive care, including 2 liters of normal saline and ondansetron for nausea.


On days 2 through 5 of hospitalization (days 6 through 9 of illness), the patient’s vital signs remained largely stable, apart from the development of intermittent fevers accompanied by periods of tachycardia (Figure 2). The patient continued to report a nonproductive cough and appeared fatigued. On the afternoon of hospital day 2, the patient passed a loose bowel movement and reported abdominal discomfort. A second episode of loose stool was reported overnight; a sample of this stool was collected for rRT-PCR testing, along with additional respiratory specimens (nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal) and serum. The stool and both respiratory specimens later tested positive by rRT-PCR for 2019-nCoV, whereas the serum remained negative.

Treatment during this time was largely supportive. For symptom management, the patient received, as needed, antipyretic therapy consisting of 650 mg of acetaminophen every 4 hours and 600 mg of ibuprofen every 6 hours. He also received 600 mg of guaifenesin for his continued cough and approximately 6 liters of normal saline over the first 6 days of hospitalization.


A chest radiograph taken on hospital day 3 (illness day 7) was reported as showing no evidence of infiltrates or abnormalities (Figure 3). However, a second chest radiograph from the night of hospital day 5 (illness day 9) showed evidence of pneumonia in the lower lobe of the left lung (Figure 4). These radiographic findings coincided with a change in respiratory status starting on the evening of hospital day 5, when the patient’s oxygen saturation values as measured by pulse oximetry dropped to as low as 90% while he was breathing ambient air. On day 6, the patient was started on supplemental oxygen, delivered by nasal cannula at 2 liters per minute. Given the changing clinical presentation and concern about hospital-acquired pneumonia, treatment with vancomycin (a 1750-mg loading dose followed by 1 g administered intravenously every 8 hours) and cefepime (administered intravenously every 8 hours) was initiated.


On hospital day 6 (illness day 10), a fourth chest radiograph showed basilar streaky opacities in both lungs, a finding consistent with atypical pneumonia (Figure 5), and rales were noted in both lungs on auscultation. Given the radiographic findings, the decision to administer oxygen supplementation, the patient’s ongoing fevers, the persistent positive 2019-nCoV RNA at multiple sites, and published reports of the development of severe pneumonia3,4 at a period consistent with the development of radiographic pneumonia in this patient, clinicians pursued compassionate use of an investigational antiviral therapy. Treatment with intravenous remdesivir (a novel nucleotide analogue prodrug in development10,11) was initiated on the evening of day 7, and no adverse events were observed in association with the infusion. Vancomycin was discontinued on the evening of day 7, and cefepime was discontinued on the following day, after serial negative procalcitonin levels and negative nasal PCR testing for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus.

On hospital day 8 (illness day 12), the patient’s clinical condition improved. Supplemental oxygen was discontinued, and his oxygen saturation values improved to 94 to 96% while he was breathing ambient air. The previous bilateral lower-lobe rales were no longer present. His appetite improved, and he was asymptomatic aside from intermittent dry cough and rhinorrhea. 

As of January 30, 2020, the patient remains hospitalized. He is afebrile, and all symptoms have resolved with the exception of his cough, which is decreasing in severity."

I think I’ve been tested maybe once in my life, and that was a couple years ago. Prior to that, if it wasn’t something obviously bacterial, like strep, that I would get antibiotics for, the doc would be like “go home and rest, you have a virus.”  Recently at my kids’ pediatrician they told me they’ve been seeing “tons” of positive flu tests lately.

1)China has their AI surveillance system to aide them in finding infected people, tracking previous whereabouts of other people etc. 

2) China does not care about human rights. Their lockdowns are really severe as I see them reported

3)China doesn’t require an  FDA equivalents approval. If its out there on the market Im guessing theyve tried it in their efforts to stem the negative effects of this virus

4)China has the ability to scale rapid response at a governmental level that I personally believe is unparalleled in the world* edit"

There's also the problem of gun owners. How in the world could the US detain so many individuals with firearms. I mean, sure, if the people are ill, they're not going to put up a fight.

3. What's the baseline? Right now the SO2 mass over Wuhan is around 200 ug/m^3 . That needs to be subtracted from the calculation.

4. Human bodies don't burn well. Even when doused with gasoline/alcohol. That's why cremation incinerator runs at 1600F.

To me its rather obvious that this virus is extremely transmittable and that the numbers coming from China are way way way understated. Partly for the CCP to obstruct real numbers and avoid unrest within China and also because testing has been proven to be poor with inconsistencies with positive/negative cases all over the place.

I too suspect that a person can be infected with this virus for weeks if not a month before showing symptoms and hence why there will be thousands if not tens of thousands of cases around the world now. For that reason I've chosen to keep a very tight circle in the last two weeks (No cases in NZ right now... yeah right)

The good side of this is that the actual mortality rate is lower than even given by the CCP but this does not mean everything is rosy. Sadly I think this thing will spread, kill a few million people and cause economic shocks throughout the world over the coming months with the people of China and ultimately the CCP being the greatest victims."

The problem with nCov is, for the US and other countries at least, there is precedence, to go with Plan-A at this point requires the assumption that China didn't already try Plan-A, that they instead jump to Plan-Z, i.e. quarantine on week 1

Based on what we now know about the virus' behavior, it's overwhelmingly more likely that China did start with Plan-A, maybe as far back as December, but it didn't work, so by the time you heard about it, it's already at Plan-Z

What CDC and a host of other countries are doing is typical Plan-A: downplay, obfuscate, placate, but unless the virus behaves differently in China than anywhere else, it's almost inevitable that everyone will eventually end at Plan-Z."

“I've observed that the breakout period of the novel coronavirus tends to be three weeks, from the onset of symptoms to developing difficulties breathing. Basically going from mild to severe symptoms takes about a week. There are all sorts of mild symptoms: feebleness, shortness of breath, some people have fevers, some don't. 

Based on studies of our 138 cases, the most common symptoms in the first stage are fever (98.6 per cent of cases), feebleness (69.6 per cent), cough (59.4 per cent), muscle pains (34.8 per cent), difficulties breathing (31.2%), while less common symptoms include headaches, dizziness, stomach pain, diarrhea, nausea, vomiting.

But some patients who enter the second week will suddenly get worse. At this stage, people should go to the hospital. The elderly with underlying conditions may develop complications; some may need machine-assisted respiration. When the body's other organs start to fail, that's when it becomes severe, while those with strong immune systems see their symptoms decrease in severity at this stage and gradually recover. So the second week is what determines whether the illness becomes critical.

The third week determines whether critical illness leads to death. Some in critical condition who receive treatment can raise their level of lymphocytes, a type of white blood cell, and see an improvement in their immune systems, and have been brought back, so to speak. But those whose lymphocyte numbers continue to decline, those whose immune systems are destroyed in the end, experience multiple organ failure and die.

For most, the illness is over in two weeks, whereas for those for whom the illness becomes severe, if they can survive three weeks, they're good. Those that can't will die in three weeks."

You can buy them online or at hardware stores still, but if you want one don't wait.  Eventually these will sell out too.  Be sure to get  some extra filters.  N95 or P100 are a good bet.

If you're going to wear this you mine as well get some swim or ski goggles if you don't have them (you're already going to stick out, why not be protected).

As far as other preparations I would suggest water, rice, beans and/or canned meats.  I am not sure these will ever be needed, but if panic sets in the last thing you want to be doing is fighting for food at the store.

I am not a dr but no matter what this is if you are having trouble having productive coughs ask your dr or advice nurse about it. 

The only cases of Wuflu with no travel to China is one possibly its currently under investigation according to WHO. The other 6 traveled there and back. 

If you are truly concerned The WHO has this on home care for suspected cases :

https://apps.who.int/iris/rest/bitstreams/1266279/retrieve

#Bottom line no matter if it’s the flu, Wuflu, or a bad cold if you are feeling like you should see a dr. GO SEE A DR. I would rather over react then dismiss it as not a big deal and end up worse. 

The taking a full breath is concerning. As even the flu can give you Pneumonia if you cannot have productive coughs. 

Bottom line if you are worried enough to call an advice nurse and are not typically to do so for every ache and pain. Go to the ER. 

My husband never complains when he is ill,  not even thru chemo. When One day he said my “leg is sore“ and i looked at it all swollen, i took him in. It was a huge blood clot above his knee. 

Listen to your gut. If you never complain or mention things but are this time go in. It is not the end of the world if it’s just the regular ole flu or bad cold."

Either (HOPEFULLY) this ‘fizzles’ out (excuse the term) or a major shift is going to happen, especially here in the United States.
People are going to realize what is going on if it gets more interesting as you say, and I feel it would cause mass chaos.
The economy will drop, people will be isolating themselves (not necessary a bad thing IF infected or suspected of infection), but there are major problems that can/will occur if this shift occurs:
Food shortages for one, also masks already being sold out, and of course the hysteria.
People will be freaked out by anyone who gets in a two-feet radius of them.

(Just as China is in worse conditions due to CCPs negligence of their own people)

I live in Orlando, FL and my whole family works at the major theme parks (Universal, Walt Disney World, & Seaworld), which happen to be tourist central. 
They don’t care to take many precautions other than use hand sanitizer when they remember to.

I even went to Universal with my cousin yesterday and tried my best to avoid people (really no luck with the crowds; after all it’s a theme park), and not touch basically anything. And if I did touch something I was hurrying to the bathroom to wash my hands or whipping out my hand sanitizer.


Sorry if this seems a bit jumbled, it’s 2am where I am now and I’m tired.

Prostitution is also rampant. It’s not unusual for someone trying to seal a business deal or show generosity to a guest by taking them to the brothel.

It's way more contagious, and therefore has the potential to become a worldwide pandemic.  A 10% mortality on 10,000 people isn't as bad as a 1% mortality on a billion.  


Second, it's not just mortality.  If it does become widespread, there is somewhere around a 20% rate for serious illness.  That will overwhelm the healthcare system.  It will also paralyze the economy.  How do businesses function when so many workers are out sick?  They can, but it'll be difficult.  


Third, even if it ends up being isolated mostly to China- it's a huge, inextricably linked part of the world economy.  And we know it's extremely contagious with a high morbidity rate at least within China.  Forget the reported numbers, look at China's actions.  They're not going to quarantine whole cities and shut down their industrial heartland just out of an abundance of caution for a semi-serious illness.  They'd only do it for a super serious illness.  


So even if it's just China, that has material effects on the world economy, which is already on shaky ground.  The hope is that it gets contained soon, and there's  a ""V"" shaped recovery- a bounce back in the next quarter from pent up demand and orders.  It remains to be seen if that is even possible, whether much of the productivity lost is just permanently gone.    


Also, given how contagious this virus seems to be within China at the very least, what happens when they restart everything (looks like March 1st is the target)?  They need to be sure the virus is completely gone don't they?  Otherwise just a small percentage of people with the virus could just restart the epidemic.  


Last, although the above makes sense to me and is kinda grim, I've been wrong for like 10 straight years on my thoughts on how the economy would go.  So I could definitely be wrong.  SARS somehow disappeared on its own, possibly due to the weather warming, and maybe Corona will too."

And then the lag in deaths behind new infections, which are greater in number and mean more people haven't yet reached the most serious course of the disease, is going to cause us to underestimate it.

For me, it seems like we don't really know. I think the cases outside of China are going to give us the best view frankly."

- hidings fact about patient 0, we still dont know the patient 0, we do know patient 1 who has nothing to do with seafood market
- there’s an official state TV news about wuhan lab last year april 5th (CCTV 13), the video for that day disappeared about 1 week ago

if there’s nothing to hide, why would they do all those?

dont listen to what they say, look at what they do. same for all government, even ours."

It's been shown petting can be therapeutic and reduce levels of cortisol. In the unfortunate event your existing issues prevent that type of interaction, infants/children can help elevate oxytocin levels. 

Granted, it's likely more prominent if it's your child but my main idea is to step away and focus on something that can provide a healthy dose of positivity in your life.

Good luck!"
