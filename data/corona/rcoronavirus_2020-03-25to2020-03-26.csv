Lets just say a spinal surgeon, specifically doing the most challenging and complicated work, takes about 30-40 years to make a new one.  All the standard schooling, college, medical school, and a full career of 7-10 years of building experience, before you are going to attempt a complex case. Not to mention the massive cost of training that doctor. 

You lose a few of those, and people may simply not have certain surgical options for a while, or if they can travel, the doctors doing said surgeries may be booked for months out, and in most cases, this kind of thing can't wait.  

There are many professionals like this.  Even the head mechanic at your local dealership, that deals with the most challenging cases, still has 7-10 years of experience before they got there.

Viruses are equally likely to mutate either way (more/less deadly, more/less contagious, etc.). 
A virus that mutates to be less severe and more contagious will typically spread more than a less contagious and deadly virus because 1. It spreads quicker and 2. It doesn't kill the host so it is spread for a longer period of time.
If a virus becomes more infectious with a long incubation and asymptomatic spread but high mortality rate a month post infection it can still easily become widespread.
Either one is as likely to happen as the other.

Now, if the virus mutates to become incredibly lethal within 7 days it will wipe itself out quicker because it will cripple and kill it's host before significant spread can occur (ex. Ebola)"

>  
>“The damages of keeping the economy closed as it is could be worse than losing a few more people,” said Golisano, founder and chairman of the payroll processor Paychex Inc. “I have a very large concern that if businesses keep going along the way they’re going then so many of them will have to fold.”  
>  
>  
>  
>President Donald Trump says he doesn’t want the cure for the Covid-19 pandemic “to be worse than the problem,” and some of America’s wealthiest people and executives are echoing his rallying cry. They want to revive an economy that could face its worst quarterly drop ever -- even if it means pulling back on social distancing measures that public health officials say can help stop coronavirus. These investors aren’t prizing profits over lives, they say, they’re just willing to risk some horrors to avoid others.  
>  
>“You’re picking the better of two evils,” said Golisano, who wants people to go back to their offices in states that have been relatively spared by the coronavirus, but remain at home in hot spots. “You have to weigh the pros and cons.”  
>  
>In New York, where hospitals are at a tipping point and getting pummeled by patients, Governor Andrew Cuomo says the economy shouldn’t be restarted “at the cost of human life” and that he’s developing a plan that “lets younger people get back to work.”  
>  
>  
>  
>  
>  
>The question is when they should do it.  
>  
>Trump, guided by a group of hedge fund and private equity titans, wants the country up and running again by Easter, though public health officials warn that’s too soon for a virus that’s killed more than 18,400 and infected at least 400,000 worldwide. Only companies with less than 500 employees are required to provide paid sick leave for workers out with Covid-19. Economists from Northwestern University calculated that keeping social distancing practices in place until cases decline could save 600,000 lives nationwide.  
>  
>Read also: Here’s What It Would Take to Get the U.S. Economy Back to Work

>Lloyd Blankfein, who ran Goldman Sachs Group Inc. until 2018, helped kickstart the calls to get back to work on Sunday when he tweeted that “extreme measures to flatten the virus ‘curve’” were sensible “for a time” but could crush the economy: “Within a very few weeks let those with a lower risk to the disease return to work.”  
>  
>His longtime deputy, Gary Cohn, who left the bank to become Trump’s top economic adviser, asked if it was time “to start discussing the need for a date when the economy can turn back on.” Without clarity, businesses “will assume the worst,” he said.  
>  
>Tilman Fertitta, owner of Golden Nugget casinos and Bubba Gump Shrimp, is calling on authorities to let businesses reopen at limited capacity in a couple of weeks to avoid a long economic disaster. Fertitta, who also owns the Houston Rockets and is worth $3.2 billion, said his company is “doing basically no business.” His demand goes against a school of thought that says prematurely reopening the economy could kill more people and eventually cause more economic harm.  
>  
>Billionaires and other members of the elite have the luxury of social distancing while making money. The ones who want workers back in their jobs say they’re aiming to stop millions from suffering for years and falling further into debt. Officials are trying to accomplish that by restricting foreclosures and allowing Americans to defer mortgage payments.  
>  
>“It’s outrageous,” said Robert Reich, who was labor secretary for President Bill Clinton and now studies public policy at the University of California, Berkeley. “It is absolutely necessary to shut down the economy so that millions of people don’t die.

During the Spanish Flu pandemic a century ago young people were the main age group dying from the virus due to cytokine storms.

When the immune system is fighting pathogens, cytokines signal immune cells such as T-cells and macrophages to travel to the site of infection. In addition, cytokines activate those cells, stimulating them to produce more cytokines. 

Normally, this feedback loop is kept in check by the body. However, in some instances, the reaction becomes uncontrolled, and too many immune cells are activated in a single place. The precise reason for this is not entirely understood but may be caused by an exaggerated response when the immune system encounters a new and highly pathogenic invader.

When a cytokine storm occurs in the lungs, for example, fluids and immune cells such as macrophages may accumulate and eventually block off the airways, potentially resulting in death."

There is no such thing. ""Common sense"" is inconsistently biased, simplistic, unscientific and outright opinion or superstition in many, many cases.

It used to make sense when the size of anyone's ""world"" was small enough to integrate possibly all of it — polymaths, people highly skilled in different domains, was a thing back then. You could have ""common sense"" insofar as general ideas may transfer from one domain to another. 

The hyper-complexity of the world has now rendered ""common sense"" generally moot and even detrimental. See how people use perfectly sound logic to understand time-series or probabilities, and how it utterly fails because these are wildly unintuitive precisely — demographics has to be the hardest in that regard. I was trained in statistics and physics-math and all my intuitions still failed miserably when I took a demographics course).

Most scientists today would explain this much better than me. Beware of ""common sense"" because it can be used to justify just about any idea, and opinion, because it's too simplistic, ""dumb"" action-reaction first-degree causality-bound analysis.

OP said logical, which avoids the pitfall of ""common sense"", but it's a cop out — you can't be logical about something you haven't learned, and epidemiology or virology aren't exactly fields of popular interest (at least until 2020, that is).

Further they were helped by the deadline of having to rule on new years celebrations. They had a scary pneumonia, with few recovered at all by the time the decision had to be made, and known human to human transmission. *Of course* you shut it down. We know around the world that if you wait for 25 deaths, you'll be lucky to stay under 3000. That was China.

This alternative theory, I don't even know how it's supposed to have played out. They waited until 2500 deaths before deciding to cancel new years?

This is not true.

According to this morning's press conference from the RKI, another reason for the low death rate may be that the amount of older people that have been infected in Germany is very low, compared to other countries. 

However, don't get me wrong. I approve absolutely of the RKI's strategy in containing the virus (also I'm no expert, so I listen to experts) and I'm glad that we have rational and reasonable people in places of power."

Terminal lucidity, rally before death or end-of-life rally, refers to an unexpected return of mental clarity and memory, or suddenly regained consciousness that occurs in the time shortly before death in patients suffering from severe psychiatric or neurological disorders. This phenomenon has been noted in patients with schizophrenia, tumors, strokes, meningitis, Parkinson's disease, and Alzheimer's disease.It may be present even in cases of patients with previous mental disability. There are two subtypes: one that comes gradually (a week before death), and another that comes rapidly (hours before death). The former occurs in the majority of cases.
