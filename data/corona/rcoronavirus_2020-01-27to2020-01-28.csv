Example 

80 / 2800 = 0.028571428571428

So 2.8 % mortality rate.

Extropolate that to total population of the area let's say 12 million.(assumption that every person is actually infected)

 12,000,000 X 0.028 = 336000

Final assumption is that mortality rate remains constant but that is unlikely as it is a variable.

You need to be careful of low infection areas because law of small numbers comes into effect. 

E.g a small island of 20 people, 2 people die from the infection. 

Both people were in the infection zone at the time and never returned to the small island. 

You now have a mortality rate of 10% of the islands population or 100% of the citizens infected from that island."

The bad things about this virus are: 

1) no early information by Chinese authorities (they allowed it to spread), 

2) novel virus so we (the world) didn't know how it worked, 

3) RO is 3-5 (meaning 1 person will infect 3-5 of every 10 people he or she comes in contact with). This is according to early studies; the value of the R0 may be found to be different later as more cases are included in the statistical analyses. This is higher than SARS, which has R0 of 2.8.

4) Mortality reports are 3-10% of the severely ill. We still don't know what percentage become severely ill. 

Remember: we have only seen lethal cases in China...Mortality depends not only on how bad the virus is but also on the quality of healthcare, overall population health, availability of resources and previous knowledge about the disease. Large amount of patients with an unknown disease (novel) face a higher mortality. SARS mortality has become lower with time, as we have learned about it. Ebola patients in Africa had a much higher mortality than those treated outside Africa because healthcare and resources were poor or scarce and pre-infection health of patients was bad (e.g. bad nutrition, etc).

5) long period of incubation (up to 14 days)

6) transmission of the disease is possible during the incubation period (meaning before symptoms happen) allowing ""seemingly healthy"" infected people to spread the disease'

7) the 21st century allows movement of massive amounts of people fast around the globe...which means that in less than 24 hours large amounts of people with the virus (and no symptoms at all) can find their way to another country.

Soldiers traveling from Europe to the Americas, returning from war, are though to have been a major factor in spreading the influenza virus that caused the 1918 Spanish flu pandemic.

The only good thing about the virus is: it's NOT airborne, it's spread by droplets, which is slower than airborne transmission. (ok it's bad but it's not as bad!).

Is it an apocalyptic event like in the movies (Contagion, Virus, etc? We don't have enough information to know for sure (and that's terrible) but it's lethal and easily spread enough to be of concern. 

What I think is that regardless of the pandemic definition by the WHO, maybe it's time to call it a global issue, be more aggressive in keeping the sick away from the healthy population (examples: quarantine, travel restrictions, etc), and providing the zone with ill people with resources and personnel to take care of sick people and take care of the healthy ones,  until the problem is solved. It's called containment.

Just in case, I have goggles, masks and gloves (and of course lots of soap!) in case it hits my area. And if it comes to my area, I will buy tons of non-perishable food and try to go out as little as possible. Luckily, there are no direct flights from Asia arriving anywhere close to me."

Another user on this Reddit presents a graph of sars to ncov and ncov’s growth rate seems largely exponential. Before posting “flu more a threat than corona” you need to be specific about how it only effects the U.S. and the fact that this article is two days old. The news changed drastically in two days.

No mention is made of the requirement for an N95 but wouldn’t hurt to use over a surgical mask but more stringent equipment such as face shields and full gowns for health care workers should also be considered. 

I would just like to say that based on your post, you are quite uninformed. Coronavirus is spread via nebulizing droplet which means that it is not airborne. Airborne means that it is free floating and can reside in the air for hours on end. For it to be an airborne virus, you would literally have to follow biocontainment procedure with respirators and full level 3 or 4 quarantine. So you clearly don’t understand the difference between particle and droplet. It is spread through the air in short distances, you would literally have to be standing in front of someone who sneezed (probably more than once) to actually be exposed. It is also spread via touch and hard surfaces. In fact, I would argue that the spread of the novel coronavirus is more effective via hard surface and touch than it is droplet. Regardless control measures should all be the same. 

It is very upsetting when uninformed people post potentially harmful and misleading information like this and it is my duty as a public health professional to correct. I suggest you take my comments with a grain of salt and learn from the experience. You might be asking, what the hell does this person know? I am a professional epidemiologist who has worked with viruses for the past decade and have worked in level 3 biocontainment facilities."

If it gets bad, keeping a rational head on is key. I would keep up to date by reading the Lancet medical journals (free for everyone right now as long as it is coronavirus related), WHO sitreps and CDC recommendations.

I also follow the imperial college's research here, as they keep things pretty clear and are quick to update their research based on the latest data.

[https://www.imperial.ac.uk/mrc-global-infectious-disease-analysis/news--wuhan-coronavirus/](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/mrc-global-infectious-disease-analysis/news--wuhan-coronavirus/)

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

There are multiple ways you can prepare yourself (and CDC recommends most of these actions).

&#x200B;

Prepare a minimum of two weeks worth of non-perishable foods in your house (up to a month probably wouldn't hurt).

Have a first aid kit in your house, plus bottled water. It wouldn't hurt to have a means to boil water without electricity in your house as well.

Have a portable radio and lots of spare batteries (or have a solar/hand cranked radio). Candles, a lighter, and a flashlight are also good to have (just for general preparedness).

Make sure your family has gotten the flu shot if you can, that way if things do get bad, you will be able to avoid false positives. If this blows over getting the flu shot is still a great idea because prevention is usually much cheaper than a cure!

Stay healthy right now (so have a balanced diet, use Vitamin C supplements if needed). A healthy body has a stronger immune system and will let you fight off any disease more effectively.

&#x200B;

The CDC website will probably have more information!"

This is according to early studies; the value of the R0 may be found to be different later as more cases are included in the statistical analyses. This is higher than SARS, which has R0 of 2.8.

Various studies have put the R0 lower:

>However, on January 23, 2020, the WHO released the report of its IHR Emergency Committee for nCoV; the report noted that ""fourth generation transmission"" was occurring, and **cited internal analyses placing the basic reproduction number (R0) at between 1.4 and 2.5**; this report noted that 557 cases (which I'll round up to 600 cases) had been confirmed as of January 22, 2020 (ref.1). **Several estimates of R0 appeared from independent groups around the same time; these estimates were remarkable in their consistency, ranging from 1.4 to 3.8**

It's also worth noting that [SARS had an R0 of 3.8 in Beijing.](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/9/12/03-0382-techapp2.pdf)

These numbers are being given far too much prominence given their limited data base and the inconsistent findings, not to mention that R0s do not remain consistent over the course of an outbreak."

Basically I'm from India,I live in one of the major cities(Bangalore). To put in the us sense ,it's our San fransisco.so it's big city with all major international flights.

There has been no reports in India. yet,not to sound like a**hole,but if at all the virus spreads here,it's going to be a shit show.i am 90% sure it will be a major disaster. The population density is high AF in almost all 4 metropolitan cities(Delhi and Mumbai just two cities has more population than the whole of Canada) plus if something happens the ratio of doctor to patient is unimaginable because even though I live in a city people who are on tier 2,3 cities are going to manage but villages don't get access to healthcare during normal times( they make almost 65% of the population),let alone during epidemic.Even though I am worried about me and my family but we will have access to everything and world class medical care,I am worried about the millions who can't afford (we are talking about literally millions I'm talking double digit or may be triple digit).even though it not as bad as they show in slum dog millionaire, it's still a shit show compared to all other countries ,you know what even china.trust me in  India other than major cities,it's going to a fuck fest.

It's a hard pill to swallow but India is doomed,I know may sound anti-nationalist but it's time people wake up.i too had so much hope when growing up and it gradually died right in front of my eyes. Even if nothing happens the population explosion is real and we are running out of resources and the pollution is going out of control and on top of this, the majority of population is racist, Islamaphobic, trans and homophobic and bigot who are just bunch boomers who won't listen to the facts and just thinks God is gonna save them all.
I know I'm rating it got out of control.For the first time my thoughts are inked. some may even called my be a spoiled brat,yes I am so thankful for all the resources I grew up with which on par with almost first world countries yet my mind can't process the fact that India is beyond redemption. Yes we may seem like we are developing country yet it is just the cities,my hope for it becoming a developed country died when I was as small as 14, I'm 21 now.a 14 year old can see the problem but government can't because they are too busy fighting casteism (our version of racism but the government is on the side of whites so imagine ) and stealing money from the same people. 

The very small % of the people who see this for what it is,they are trying very hard to get out of this shit hole before it goes into chaos.


P.s I'm not sorry if I offended anyone's opinion,it's facts mf ,wake the fuck up."

 The people in China in the hospital are there because they are seriously ill. However, there are probably many thousands who have mild cases that never went to the hospital , so we don't really know how many people get seriously ill compared to the number who are mildly ill.

I've had pneumonia..  it is not fun - it takes a good while to recover from it if its severe enough. Because of this, the recovery numbers are going to be low until this progresses further.

My feelings on this is that even if the fatality is at 3% and not 10% like with SARS, China's biggest concern right now is that their health system will become overrun to the point it becomes too oversaturated to be affective. If that happens (like it appears to be happening in Wuhan province), then those who are sick will be in greater risk of death if their condition is serious enough. Add in those with this Corona virus getting serious pneumonia and there becomes a bigger compounding problem. This is beyond just the Corona Virus in itself and its fatality rate - this affects everyone in need of serious medical care who can't affectively get it. Its like having billions of people without having medical services for any of them. What will happen? What happens when people want all their money from a bank when the bank can't provide it for everyone? The system just grinds to a halt.

I think this is why we are seeing the lax response by first world countries at the moment and why those infected outside of China are all recovering well. Its about how the medical system is able to function."

Many people are panic buying or hoarding N95 masks in other countries such as the US to sell to China which results in a shortage in the US as well.  If you were to check your local pharmacies and super stores, chances are all useful masks have already been bought out.  Your best chance at an N95 mask will be at a home depot, lowes, or menards in the painting section.  Protective eye wear, masks, and full body protective wear can also be found in these stores.

Biological warfare (BW)—also known as germ warfare—is the use of biological toxins or infectious agents such as bacteria, viruses, and fungi with the intent to kill or incapacitate humans, animals or plants as an act of war. Biological weapons (often termed ""bio-weapons"", ""biological threat agents"", or ""bio-agents"") are living organisms or replicating entities (viruses, which are not universally considered ""alive"") that reproduce or replicate within their host victims. Entomological (insect) warfare is also considered a type of biological weapon. This type of warfare is distinct from nuclear warfare and chemical warfare, which together with biological warfare make up NBC, the military initialism for nuclear, biological, and chemical warfare using weapons of mass destruction (WMDs).

Self sustaining, **human-to-human transmission** is already present in **all major** Chinese cities.

Seeding outside mainland China and subsequent local establishment may become inevitable, unless SOME OR ALL OF THE FOLLOWING INTERVENTIONS ARE DEPLOYED QUICKLY.

Of course the global health officials don't want to cause an international panic and recession.  But consider it from their perspectives- if they see a crisis and fail to act promptly, the recession happens a few weeks later, *and their own careers go to shit.*

During this period of the year, a lot of tourists cross those villages and family and friends of the villagers go to visit them. They are also prohibiting the villagers from visiting their families, and blocking the passage of public vehicles, subway stations and etc.

The majority of Chinese people on the internet seem positive about those attitudes, while others not so much.

Ym soon commented: ""When the government does nothing, the people naturally have to take self-protection measures. In this extraordinary period, excessive or even extreme measures are better than loosening! Life is off, who can afford to lose?""

Grace ooi commented: ""Seeing these photos, I was in a paradoxical mood, happy and sad. I ’m glad that the uncles and aunts finally raised their awareness of prevention. Sadly, the epidemic is serious."" (Uncle and Aunts refers to 40+ years old people).

2020-01-27,yullee18,Coronavirus,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/euqkyt/stop_comparing_the_flu_with_the_coronavirus/ffr021g/,"The flu is widely spread, so it kills 35,000 per year. Now let’s say officials worldwide do not get the coronavirus under control, and it is spread as widely as the flu. Because it is 30x more lethal (.01% vs. 3%) that would kill 30x as many. That would be 1,050,000. Over a million. 

If the official numbers are to be believed (which they’re not) 2,744 have gotten sick in a month. Estimates show the R0 of this virus could be up to 5.47, meaning for every one person sick they are likely to infect 5.47 others. (For reference, the common flu has an R0 of only 0.9-2.1) With a two week incubation, that means in two weeks alone that 2,744 could become 15,000. You can keep doing the math but the growth, undisturbed, would total in the millions infected after the year is out. And those are lowball estimates because the incubation is UP to 2 weeks and people are contagious the entire period they show symptoms. 

So this virus is very serious, and new, and officials are working to get it under control as fast as possible.

Airborne disease can spread when an infected person coughs, sneezes, or **talks**, spewing nasal and throat secretions into the air. Certain viruses or **bacteria** **take flight and hang in the air** or land on other people or surfaces.

When you breathe airborne pathogenic organisms in, they take up residence inside you. You can also pick up germs when you touch an infected surface, and then touch your own eyes, nose, or mouth."

the treatment you are referring to is currently being tested to treat the symptoms of the coronavirus.

It’s only been 2 weeks since we even knew about the coronavirus and there’s over 2700 confirmed people with it and 80 CONFIRMED deaths- media outlets in China reports even more high numbers. 

SARS didn’t spread this fast. And didn’t have this long of a incubation period. 

If you give me a 5-10% of the world population getting the flu every year and 200-300k people die .... the coronavirus is still WAY WAY worse then the flu. 

We also don’t have a treatment for the coronavirus. If you have the flu- you go and get tamiflu or stay at home sick- with this- there’s nothing and if you do nothing there’s a high chance you will die- MUCH higher chance then the flu. 

Again- YES a lot of people die from the flu.

I know you’re working, but see if you can wash your hands with hot soap and water a few times a day.  Also, be aware of touching your face, something we all do up to a couple thousand times a day, believe it or not. This is often the top culprit for flu transmission, not some stupid guy coughing on you. Frequently when you get the flu you touched a surface like a door handle to a building, then touched your face. Other than that, I plan to avoid heavily crowded places like malls and movie theaters and stuff like that. I’ll go grocery shopping but will do so during off hours. Unless you’re gonna lock yourself in a cabin in Idyllwild, it’s all about reducing opportunities for exposure and thereby mitigating risk."

That's a transcription from a conference. I hope it's an incomplete transcription or a loose use of the word airborne!
if this virus is truly airborne then the isolation methods being used have been insufficient and the spread is vaster

multiple sources had said droplets and fomites (surfaces dirty with ""dirty"" droplets and direct contact) :( 

here are some sources: 
https://www.health.nsw.gov.au/Infectious/controlguideline/Pages/novel-coronavirus.aspx
Where human-to-human transmission occurs, it would most likely be through direct contact with case-patients, by respiratory droplets and by fomites (contaminated objects and surfaces), as is seen with SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV infections.

https://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/handle/10665/330375/WHO-2019-nCoV-IPC-v2020.1-eng.pdf
Suspected nCoVpatients should be placed in an area separate from other patients, and additional IPC (droplet and contact) precautions promptly implemented."

a place like Wuhan where infectivity is quite high comparing to the rest 

there is this huge mall/building/whatever where mas amount of people coming and go every day... 

on times like these 3 out, 100 are infected and will infect more on public gatherings (according to statistics from various news channels)

so in a day on this building, 1000 people will enter and exit 

before entering and after the first check/test whatever that is

how about allowing 50 people at a time where they will have to cross through a corridor made of sheets or whatever in less than an hour. 

After standing still for a 10 to 30 sec exposure to **Far-UVC light (no..  IT's not UV.. again)** while keeping their eyes closed and then leave?

&#x200B;

maybe it sounds far fetched

not sure how effective it will be

but if it is.. it is a tiny inconvenience to a far bigger risk
