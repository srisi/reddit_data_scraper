Clearly that is not happening because in places with mandatory BCG a huge percentage is vaccinated and epidemics are ongoing.

What some people are claiming and I think it might be plausible is that while BCG does not stop the infection by the coronavirus  it might lead to a more benigne disease, with lower mortality rates. Not necessarily a less infectious disease. 

A specific vaccine would indeed affection transmission and lead to herd immunity. The BCG is not specific to this and it can not be expected to act that way. It just might, might, by having trained the immune system of the vaccinated, give them a little bit of a edge preventing the onset of serious respiratory collapse."

You say ""more people who are out with get sick"" as if it's a bad thing. It's not. More infections is a good thing. For example an early antibody test from a Chicago hospital showed that up to 50% of the patients there had Coronavirus antibodies despite only 10% of them actually testing positive. That means quite a large swath of the population has already been infected and recovered. This is GOOD NEWS. Not bad. I'm not sure where you get the figure of ""literally millions hospitalized"" from? None of the models predicted that. Not even the Imperial College model that was later revised downward by a factor of 10 times.

You also mention ""high viral loads"" which has already been shown not to actually increase your Covid symptoms. https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.15.20036707v2.full.pdf

[Meanwhile](https://www.cnn.com/2020/01/31/health/coronavirus-asymptomatic-spread-study/index.html) as early as January 31, 2020 CNN is reporting that COVID-19 could be spread even when someone isn't showing symptoms.

You're welcome to provide your own list of Fox News sources and other such garbage who feed into Trump's approved narrative but even if every media outlet out there was reporting it's no worse than the flu doesn't excuse the fact that Trump, the supposed president, ignored expert advice and guidance for months while lying to the American people about it.

But people like yourself are gonna bend over backwards to find someone else to blame for the mess Trump created because he's an ineffective leader (at best) who disregards science and expert advice in favor of stroking his ego.

Then you lot fall in line to stroke him as well."

I’ll quote the risk assessment:

>WHO risk assessment

>This is the first exported case of novel coronavirus from Wuhan city, China. Since the initial report of cases in Wuhan city on 31 December 2019, 41 cases have a preliminary diagnosis of 2019-nCoV infection, including 1 death in a person with severe underlying medical conditions (for more information, please see the Disease Outbreak News published on 12 January 2020 ).

>As the traveler did not report having visited the market linked to most of the other cases, it is vital that investigations continue to identify the source of infection. To date, China has not reported any cases of infection among healthcare workers or contacts of the cases. Based on the available information there is no clear evidence of human-to-human transmission. No additional cases have been detected since 3 January 2020 in China.

>Additional investigation is needed to ascertain the presence of human-to-human transmission, modes of transmission, common source of exposure and the presence of asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic cases that are undetected. It is critical to review all available information to fully understand the potential transmissibility among humans.

This shows that the possibility of human-to-human transmission was seriously considered, and the details of this case made it seem possible. 

This contrasts with the [12 January notice when it was still only in China](https://www.who.int/csr/don/12-january-2020-novel-coronavirus-china/en/). Regarding transmission modes, this is all it states on possible human-to-human transmission:

> According to the preliminary epidemiological investigation, most cases worked at or were handlers and frequent visitors to the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market. The government reports that there is no clear evidence that the virus passes easily from person to person.

And later:

> More comprehensive information and ongoing investigations are also required to better understand the epidemiology, clinical picture, source, modes of transmission, and extent of infection; as well as the countermeasures implemented.

With this context, the tweet is even more irresponsible. The text implies human-to-human transmission was not likely, while this context suggests it is a serious concern despite the lack of clear evidence."

Wait, so is it just the conservatives that say stupid shit? I thought it was everyone. Or is them that are simply especially bad? I've seen my fair share of stupid conservative and liberal shit. Where's the liberal shit?

>Besides her being a conservative isnt brought up here, just the fact that she said something blatantly stupid...

How is it blatantly stupid in the context of coronavirus *literally* shutting down everything? I walk down the street and stores are closed. My university is shut down, classes are online, I have to be back home before curfew some days. Is what she said blatantly stupid, or are you just calling it stupid because you have some weird need to generalize all conservatives and everything they said as stupid? ""It's time to start the reopen of America"" seems like a fine statement to me. Even the guy responding to her on twitter... well, he could be saying the same thing of anyone working a comfy office job. My dad and mom work professional jobs either in office or from home. Do they need to start cleaning bedpans at hospitals or else not have an opinion on the whole thing?

>That means its being politicized by people such as yourself in the comments who bring politics into the discussion, rather than just letting it be what it is.

Lol what? This is obviously political. You call it ""a burn on an out of touch asshole."" You call her out of touch because of her political views. Just because you didn't directly say that's the reason doesn't make it not so. Politics was involved in this post before it even had comments.

Outro fator deve ser considerado para o fato da H1N1:

""Um terceiro fator é importante para explicar os números desta pandemia em relação à de 2009: nenhuma pessoa tem imunidade contra o Sars-Cov-2, ao contrário do H1N1, que afetava menos idosos do que uma gripe comum.

O virologista Anderson Brito, do departamento de epidemiologia da Escola de Saúde Pública da Universidade de Yale, nos Estados Unidos, diz que isso provavelmente está relacionado a outras duas pandemias anteriores, da gripe asiática, em 1957, e da gripe de Hong Kong, de 1968, também causadas por outros vírus influenza.

“As pessoas com mais de 60 anos já estavam de certa forma imunizadas por aqueles vírus e não eram infectadas ou conseguiam reagir melhor”, afirma Brito.

Não há um medicamento contra o vírus como em 2009…

Até o momento, não existe um antiviral para combater o novo coronavírus. Mas, quando a pandemia de H1N1 ocorreu, já havia medicamentos deste tipo para vírus da gripe comum.

Por isso, em 2009, dois antivirais — oseltamivir, mais conhecido no mercado como Tamiflu, e, em menor escala, zanamivir — foram usados para combater o H1N1.""

Responding a bit later because i was at the hospital all last night. (i have some work in a coronavirus drug trial) 

No problem at all sir! I'm sorry you drew a lot of heat for your opinions. Please remember (althought you probably already know) that veering into personal insults just means fear or anger or insecurity compelled whoever it was, to abandon the mission that should be at the heart of any discussion about the real world, which is to look for the truth together. 

>I want to start off by saying that social democracy is about helping the poor by taking from the rich and redistributing that.

I don't agree with this definition. I live Denmark, which is perhaps the most social democratic country there is in the world. ""Socialdemokratiet"" dominated our politics from about 1924 to 1982 and is still the biggest party. This is to such an extent that while we've had ""blue governments"" the largest parties of the ""blue block"" all have large historical derivations from Socialdemokratiet. 

Social democracy is about A LOT of other things than the kind of wealth redistributions you mention. In fact most of the economic foundation is adapted to a fully capitalist extraneous and international market with a built-in aim to stabilize the national economy through several means. For example public sector projects similar to American Keynesian (and other attempts to stabilize demand). I'll stop ranting on this for now but if you want we can definitely discuss the contents or merits of modern and classic social democracy. 

>Biden is very clearly sent on stage, the way he reads his speeches and the way he talks about his campaign is showing that the DNC is pushing him hard. We saw that again with the possibly rigged primaries, with exit polls being off by up to 11%. 3% is already strongly significant of a rigged election.

I agree with you that he was clearly pushed very hard by the DNC, and probably more importantly by a specific *section* of the DNC, the part most affiliated with the financial interests you and i would probably rather see not be in politics. 

I *don't* totally agree that his victory was so inconsistent with polls. 3% is only evidence of tampering if the sample is perfect. No polling samples is perfect, which is the reason why you can have different polls on the same thing right now at realclearpolitics.com which have 10% differences between them. 

""Rigged"" gets thrown around a lot, and i think it is important to say in what way. Discouraging population segments from voting and even making it logistically very hard for them could be called ""rigging"". Unfairly giving a platform to one to the other could also be considered rigging it. etc. 

If it was the case that trusted polling indicated that Sanders votes were being (on a serious scale) turned fraudulently into Biden votes, i honestly don't think he would've dropped out.

>Biden is also showing strong signs of dementia, pushing someone like this instead of Buttigieg signifies that someone may replace Biden once he is in office, this someone would be the VP. The VP will not be Bernie (shocker, I know).

I'm an old (i'm 33, worked at the hospital for the last 5) medical student who is currently paused for neurological research. Take it for what you will, but i believe it is false to say that there is clear evidence of dementia in Biden. It is true that he is not a gifted speaker. Neither elegant and quip like Obama nor in the maybe bullyish and aggressive manner in which Trump must be at least respected as a speaker.

The thing with these sorts of neurological signs is; if they would be much more consistent. If i go and watch a Biden speech right now, i won't necessarily find *any* signs and that's just not consistent with the theory. The fact that he has had some speeches where he stumples, loses track, etc. does not prove something about his general neurological condition (except that he is perhaps much more vulnerable to mental fatigue than many others).

Just as an aside, i'm actually doing research with alzheimers right now, focusing on hemodynamic properties :)

I totally agree with you that it is extremely unlikely that Bernie is picked as VP. I also agree with you that this is bad.

>Trump may be very pro-corporation, but he has shown hate for the CCP in the past, something no president has done since the 90s despite China stealing pretty much all valuable intellectual data in the US. A trade war against China is good for the US and the world in the long run as the US can fairly keep profits from R&D and develop new technologies. Trumps motivation was correct, his method was not.

This becomes very complex, without going too far off on this tangent i will say i agree with you that China, if not ""steals"", at least takes very indescriminately. On the issue of intellectual property it is importnat to remember that this phenomenon (at least in this scale) is quite new. It's not like the 1880-90's patent offices where an Albert Einstein might have sat around. In a certain sense, it is not up to the U.S to determine the international standards for intellectual property rights. We can agree however that protecting R/D industry is valuable. 

>Trump is also balancing the Democratic overload and now even abuse if the justice system, as Sidney Powell explains, the attorney of General Flynn. Biden would tip that overload into total control.

I suppose this depends on who you think should be on the supreme court. I believe it is worth pointing out here that this ""overload"" is not a natural equillibrium. In political dynamisms, it is oftne the case that one wave overtakes the other side and the other side is ""turned"" on the issues of that wave. 

Consider forexample if the civil rights movement was seen in the same way. That people who were ""Pro civil rights"" after going above 50% in respective offices, were to be considered an ""overload"" on the system. This would be an invocation of misleading terminology, using the premise that civil rights as an issue is equally right and equally wrong. That being said, if you simply say it is your personal opinion that the justices should be of a certain background i totally accept that as a valid position to take, the interesting part is then just who and for what reasons.

>In summary, Trump is bad, but Biden is already just as bad, but worsening. Climate change will only be able to come into play in 2024, I'm afraid.

Biden and Trump are totally different on Climate Change. I agree with you that they are both very pro-corporate - and i agree with you that this is not desireable. However, i also disagreed with Sanders on wiiiiide variety of things. However, given the kind of power an American currently has to influence policy, if i was living in the US now, i would participate in as many demonstrations as possible and vote for Biden. This doesn't come from a place of hate or anger or fear. In fact, i don't believe Trump even is a climate change denier at heart. I think he probably doesn't care that much, but he probably would believe a scientist who explained it to him properly, if he trusted the person. However, as with so many other things in politics, the man becomes, to some extent, what his base wants him to be. In this case, the GOP and Trump have unfortunately cemented themselves on the wrong side on the one issue that is and will only increase in being, the by very, very far most important political issue in the world. 

I love the U.S. a lot. 

apart from my love for it, i believe that on top of the economic and military power it is in the world, it's most important position is as a kind of cultural leader of the world. For that reason i still believe that the most important political arena for this idea knowledge about climate science to win it's position, is in the US (even if China was already richer, we are indeed all living in america, as the Rammstein lyric goes). 

Most of us are probably doomed. Perhaps most forms of reversion is too late. (We can go through he scenarios with best offered odds if you like) But if current civilization is to have any good chance of even *adapting* (if we must take that strategy) even that path will depend on political acceptance of reality first. 

Biden doesn't offer much else, but offering one small thing, is so much more important than everything else in my opinion."

Here’s my insight.  I know this is the insane parents sub but I have hope. 

This is a misunderstanding between the two of you and I wonder if your dad can calmly talk with you about this matter. Clearly he is hurt about you not paying enough respect to the freedom that was fought for by your Papa. There’s something there he would like you to notice further in some way and I’m big with paying homage to those who fought for us personally. That could be a good talking point—having him just reminisce about “Papa.” 

Also socialism is a scary thing usually anyway—I’m using the destroyed countries (like Venezuela) for an example—your father has lived through seeing countries collapse over it. You should see if he has wise things to say about it and try to come together on at least some points so as to not dismantle your relationship. Once again it is not okay to be threatening someone, let alone your own child. But I think there is a right way this conversation can happen and it’s not over text. I hope you feel safe enough to have an in-person convo!! I truly do. I just think both of you can be more empathetic to each other’s views and some how come together. 

I’m more optimistic about this becuase saying “wow that’s crazy”—while it may be true—is not doing anything to help a relationship. That’s my 2 cents, and I hope I could at least help you see something you already knew deep down! ❤️



(Also it just pains me to see people not having good relationships with their fathers, this post comes two days after the 5th anniversary of my father’s death, so I try to be hopeful that people can salvage what is still there!! Much love please stay safe in this coronavirus world)."

Think of measels - typically, no one would say that someone was diagnosed with ""the measels"" (outside of humor, I guess). That would also be the case with almost any other disease: cancer, typhoid, diabetes, mononucleosis, rabies, etc."

Every time you got a common cold, you wouldn't know if you're spreading coronavirus or just another common cold; basically, society would have to assume that you're always contagious.

I'm working overseas right now.  Part of getting a visa was getting chest x-rays and proving that I don't have lung scarring that reflects latent tuberculosis that can randomly 'reactivate'.  If you have that, you're a potential spreader of tuberculosis for the rest of your life.  So, you get deported.  You're kinda fucked for life.

2020-04-11,williambotter,brasilnoticias,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/brasilnoticias/comments/fzf05p/epidemias_qué_podemos_aprender_de_la_antigua_roma/fn41sod/," La peste se encontraba sellada dentro de una urna de oro en un templo de Babilonia. Un soldado romano que saqueaba el templo abrió aquella urna y la infección viajó a Occidente con el ejército en su retirada. [Ese fue el origen de la gran peste antonina](//elpais.com/noticias/peste/) (c. 165-180 d. C.) conforme al relato de un autor latino.

 Las epidemias no eran algo desconocido, ni mucho menos, para el mundo antiguo. Se calcula que se producía un brote serio en algún lugar del área del Mediterráneo cada 10 o 20 años. Dos de esos brotes fueron especialmente severos: la peste antonina y otro brote que se produjo unos 70 años después (c. 251-266 d. C.), según la descripción del autor cristiano Cipriano. Algunos comentaristas modernos afirman que estos dos brotes provocaron la caída del Imperio Romano. Ante el coronavirus, merece la pena preguntarse si hay algo que podamos aprender de la experiencia de los romanos.

 Volviendo sobre la peste antonina, el historiador Amiano escribía que esta había “contaminado todo de infestación y muerte desde las fronteras de Persia hasta el Rin”. Para nosotros resulta imposible identificar la enfermedad con certeza. Con un cierto conocimiento, podríamos conjeturar que hablamos de la viruela, pero nuestro problema reside en la cultura excepcionalmente libresca de los antiguos. Siglos antes, una peste golpeó la ciudad de Atenas durante las [guerras del Peloponeso](//elpais.com/cultura/2009/12/25/actualidad/1261695601_850215.html), mientras los atenienses se apiñaban tras sus murallas (430-426 a. C.). Tucídides, que sobrevivió a aquel brote, lo describió con gran detalle, pero no en unos términos que nos permitan un diagnóstico moderno fiable (la opinión médica actual se decanta por las fiebres tifoideas). [Tucídides](//elpais.com/elpais/2019/10/04/ideas/1570203590_596516.html) estableció un modelo literario, y a partir de entonces se convertiría en una moda el que todo historiador clásico incluyese alguna escena con la peste. Aquello fomentaba la exageración. Pocos autores quieren que el tema del que hablan se tome por poco importante o secundario. Todas las descripciones posteriores de las epidemias se basaban en el relato de Tucídides. [Galeno](//elpais.com/elpais/2015/06/11/ciencia/1434006669_068676.html), el gran médico de la Antigüedad, se enfrentó con la aterradora realidad vital de la peste antonina en Roma y la interpretó y la describió a través del prisma de Tucídides.

     Las diversas respuestas ante la enfermedad, como acudir a los templos, no solo no eran efectivas, sino que solían extenderla

    Los antiguos tenían una vaga idea del contagio de la infección de una persona a otra: el ejército había traído la peste al regresar de Babilonia, pero una explicación mucho más común era la de un miasma presente en el aire de ciertos lugares. Durante un brote, el emperador Cómodo (180-192 d. C.) se retiró a Laurentum, un lugar considerado inmune gracias a la olorosa fragancia de las arboledas de laureles que le daban nombre a la ciudad. En última instancia, la causa de la epidemia era casi siempre la ira de los dioses ante el vicio o la maldad del ser humano, algo que podía ser el sacrilegio de profanar una urna en un templo.

 Las diversas respuestas de los romanos ante la enfermedad no eran de ayuda y solían extender la enfermedad. Dado que la causa era divina, acudían a los dioses en busca de protección. “Febo [Apolo], dios intonso, líbranos de la nebulosa llegada de la peste”: en todas partes tenían este ensalmo escrito en los dinteles de las puertas. Según Luciano, autor satírico griego de la época, el oráculo lo había extendido un charlatán religioso. Luciano aseguraba que sus resultados iban en sentido contrario, porque fomentaba que la gente viviese con descuido y abandonara cualquier precaución. En el caso de quienes se lo podían permitir, la respuesta era la huida. Cuando la peste antonina llegó a la ciudad de Aquilea, los emperadores [Marco Aurelio](//elpais.com/cultura/2018/08/08/actualidad/1533740974_758713.html) y Lucio Vero se apresuraron a partir hacia Roma con su gran séquito. Lucio Vero murió por el camino.

 Según Cipriano, cuando la gente empezó a morir en gran número en Alejandría durante el siguiente gran brote, los cristianos “se arrimaban a ellos, los abrazaban, los lavaban y los envolvían en sus sudarios”, mientras que los paganos “arrojaban a los afectados a la calle antes de que hubiesen muerto”. Para pasar sobre el hecho de que morían tantos cristianos como paganos, Cipriano se regocijaba de que los primeros ascendían a los cielos mientras que a los segundos se los llevaban a rastras a la tortura eterna. En Roma, durante la peste antonina, el pagano Galeno asistió a numerosas víctimas de forma asidua. Entre los tratamientos supuestamente eficaces que él mismo registra se incluyen la ingesta de vinagre y mostaza o de tierra de Armenia, beber leche de la ciudad de Estabia o la orina de un niño.

 La causa no siempre era divina. Florecían las teorías conspirativas más singulares. Durante el brote que se produjo con Cómodo en el trono, un observador culto e informado como el senador e historiador Dion Casio —­que ocuparía un puesto en el consejo de dos emperadores— afirmaba que con frecuencia morían 2.000 personas diarias en la ciudad de Roma y muchas más a lo largo y ancho del Imperio. Estos infortunados, creía él, “perecían a manos de criminales que impregnaban unas agujas minúsculas con sustancias mortíferas y recibían un pago por infectar a la gente”. No se revela la identidad ni la motivación de quien lo pagaba, pero el lector podría asumir que se trataba del mismísimo y malvado emperador Cómodo.

 Existe un amplio debate sobre los efectos de la peste antonina y de su sucesora. Algunos académicos afirman unas tasas de mortalidad que ascienden hasta el 25% o incluso el 50% de la población, y se citan como prueba ciertos fragmentos de informaciones aisladas: que Marco Aurelio reclutaba esclavos, gladiadores, bandidos y bárbaros para sus guerras en el norte, que cayó el número de personas que pagaban impuestos en una pequeña región de Egipto, que una mina en los Balcanes cesó su producción…, pero los ejemplos no son muy evidentes. En lugar de aumentar los impuestos para su guerra, Marco Aurelio vendió en liquidación los tesoros almacenados en palacio, y podría haber una preocupación similar detrás de su heterodoxo reclutamiento. En Egipto, o en cualquier otro lugar, se podría haber aducido una epidemia como justificación para no pagar los impuestos. Y los efectos tampoco fueron permanentes: el experimento para surtir las filas del ejército no se volvió a repetir; el número de contribuyentes en Egipto volvió a incrementarse con el tiempo; la mina de los Balcanes reabrió 10 años después. Por encima de todo, se ha de recordar que, tras la segunda peste relatada por Cipriano, el Imperio romano de Occidente duró otro siglo más, y el de Oriente, más de un milenio.

 Ante el [coronavirus](//elpais.com/noticias/covid-19/), no hay ninguna medida práctica que podamos aprender de la experiencia de los romanos: beber orina no sirve de ayuda. Pero sí que hay lecciones útiles al respecto de cosas que debemos evitar: no echarle la culpa del brote a los demás, a grupos externos al nuestro, tal y como hicieron los romanos con los persas y con los soldados; no ceder ante las teorías de unas conspiraciones inverosímiles y descabelladas, como que hay Gobiernos que quieren asesinar en secreto a grandes segmentos de la población. Tal vez lo más significativo de todo sea un mensaje de esperanza: la peste no provocó la caída de Roma.

Has to be that first one, right?  

>Amid this much public indifference, 5G may seem like an unlikely battleground between China and the West. Yet the transition to 5G may mark the point, after decades of Chinese integration into a globalized economy, when Beijing’s interests diverge irreconcilably from those of the United States, the European Union, and their democratic peers. Because of a failure of imagination, Western powers risk capitulating in what has become a critical geopolitical arena. Simply put, neither the American nor the European public seems to view the networks that supply Snapchat clips and Uber cars as anything close to a security threat.

>Some of the world’s leading telecom-equipment manufacturers, including Huawei and ZTE, are Chinese companies with murky ownership structures and close ties to China’s authoritarian one-party government. Many in the U.S. national-security establishment rightly fear that equipment made by these companies could allow Beijing to siphon off sensitive personal or corporate data. Or it could use well-concealed kill switches to cripple Western telecom systems during an active war. The mere threat of this activity would endow China’s leadership with geopolitical leverage at all times.  

[This is what we were talking about immediately before coronavirus.](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2020/01/5g-where-china-and-west-finally-diverge/604309/) Convenient how now the people who fear 5G technology are just painted as insane wackjobs who believe some nonsensical conspiracy that obviously doesn't make sense."

I've been obsessed with trying to find a relationship (Which I still think is important), and I feel like I'm worthless if I can't get married, or stay a virgin.

As for ways to improve self-esteem?

>Become good at something:

Yea, I've felt like I'm pretty bad at everything.  Except gaming, but it's not like I'm a pro player or anything, just a regular old gamer.  Every time I've tried learning something new I don't have the discipline to continue with it.  Drawing.  Learning a language.  There's probably more that I'm just forgetting about.  I don't know what would be good to learn.  What would I enjoy?  What would be worthwhile? :/

>Fully acknowledge your past mistakes:    
>Use your mistakes to guide you:

This is probably the best one for me.  I get that I've screwed up.  I don't blame anyone else.  But even if I say that I wasted my years in high school, or college doing X, Y, and Z, I don't get that time back.  I've crippled myself by not developing myself properly in my youth.  I get that my situation is salvageable, but I have made things very difficult for myself.

>Put your own needs first:

People don't rely on me.  So I can't really be putting their needs first.  I neglect myself enough as it is.

>Ditch the people who mistreat you:

Nobody is mistreating me, thankfully.  But at the same time, I don't really have anyone I can rely on either.  I am socially distant from my family.  And my friends barely feel like friends.  I don't know!  What should friends even be like?  I talk to some people regularly, and play a few games with.  But I feel like they don't know the real me.  They don't understand my struggles, even when I came out and explained everything to one of my closest 'friends', I don't get the support I need.  I feel so alone.

>Wear clothes that fit

Yea, most of my things fit. Thought I'm starting to get holes and tears, so I should probably replace those.  And since Coronavirus lockdown, I've been in my pajamas for most of the day, only getting changed before dinner.  But at the same time, I don't like my clothing, because I feel that people aren't going to like me for what I wear.  Let me rephrase that.  People will think that I'm a plain, weaker, shut-in kind of guy based on how I dress, among other things.  And if I dressed differently, maybe people would have a favorable impression instead. :("

""Just-in-time"" delivery models to government-funded hospitals and clinics, introduced to reduce costs primarily as a result of lack of funds, essentially mean that those facilities (unless they are quite wealthy in physical space and cash flow generally -> ie. UHN, Humber River) cannot stockpile reserves and so many facilities end up reliant on the risks of tight supply chains. As you can see, that's not working out so well for a pandemic. For an example of how to do it better, check the history of 3M's supply and manufacturing chain.

Found small amounts detectable (viability unknown) viral matter in the breath of 1/3 flu patients -- this is not evidence that this is a viable transmission vector, although it does point towards a need for more research. (see the authors' conclusions)


>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0843-2

Again, see the authors' discussion:

>Among the samples collected without a face mask, we found that the majority of participants with influenza virus and coronavirus infection did not shed detectable virus in respiratory droplets or aerosols, whereas for rhinovirus we detected virus in aerosols in 19 of 34 (56%) participants (compared to 4 of 10 (40%) for influenza and 8 of 23 (35%) for coronavirus). For those who did shed virus in respiratory droplets and aerosols, viral load in both tended to be low (Fig. 1). Given the high collection efficiency of the G-II (ref. 19) and given that each exhaled breath collection was conducted for 30 min, this might imply that prolonged close contact would be required for transmission to occur, even if transmission was primarily via aerosols, as has been described for rhinovirus colds20. Our results also indicate that there could be considerable heterogeneity in contagiousness of individuals with coronavirus and influenza virus infections.

They are not saying that their findings indicate that aerosol transmission is likely to be significant at all -- pretty much the opposite."

I am very dissatisfied with how Trump has handled the whole thing, and I blame him from our country becoming the epicenter of the virus. President Trump's response, or lack of, is a a disgrace. Like China, he tried to censor it too - he forced the CDC to get his administration's approval before they can issue any statements in an attempt to hide how serious this is. And here's videos of him and Fox News calling it a hoax and claiming ""mainstream media"" is hyping up the virus to attack Trump - downplaying it instead of preparing our nation for something that we knew, for months, was coming:

https://youtu.be/ifKbwDf51bA

https://youtu.be/ch7_t2Ri2Zg

Because of his mishandling of the crisis, America is now the new epicenter of the virus.  Even now, there's no leadership from Trump. Every state is pretty much left to fend for themselves. And in order to get federal aid, states have go grovel to him and feed his ego or else he'll leave Americans in that state to die. He's literally refusing to take calls from Governors who refuses to worship him and directing the Coronavirus Response Team to do the same. Instead of getting the the ventilators states desperately need, he's feuding with the begging Governors telling them they don't need it and to show appreciation to him for the ""great job"" he's doing. And every day he shares misinformation on TV and on Twitter - misinformation doctors from his own administration has to issue corrections afterwards. His careless comments have led to critical shortages of malaria medicine and even needless death.

Meanwhile, every other country in the world have a coordinated, nationwide response to the virus. South Korea got the virus at the same time as us and they've already got it under control and life is slowly returning to normal there. Meanwhile for the United States, because of Trump's gross mishandling of the virus, the worse is yet to come.

And instead of focusing on dealing with the crisis, he's also busy on Twitter deflecting blame/distracting by issuing divisive and xenophobic statements that put Asian Americans at risk.  So as an Asian American, in addition to dealing with the virus and the loss of income I'm suffering from because of the virus, I also have to deal with the ignorant people that's been emboldened by him.

Great job you're doing there, President Trump (sarcasm). Americans will remember this when election day comes."

2020-04-11,linuxhiker,SeattleWA,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SeattleWA/comments/fz6s1j/former_washington_gov_gary_locke_says_trump/fn43htv/,"I will take your question in good faith. 

Christians are very much being marginalized. The idea that a privately owned bakery is not allowed to say, ""I do not agree with gay marriage"" and gets sued for it even though the baker was more than happy to still conduct commerce with them? Disagreeing with someone due to your religion is not hate.

Lower income citizens are directly marginalized by many Liberal policies including Gun Control. A recent bill submitted to Congress by Elizabeth Warren which increases taxes on Guns and Ammo, directly oppressing those of lower income by potentially not allowing those groups to be able to afford to exercise their 2A. (Please note: I am not a gun nut and do believe that certain regulation is prudent (background checks for example.)

Washington, a blue state has gas taxes of almost 50 cents a gallon. This directly affects lower income citizens and their ability to feed their families. I am aware of the purpose of the tax, it doesn't change the outcome (and no I don't have a better option). 

Bellingham, WA (A Sanders city) is considering banning Natural gas/Propane (like Berkeley) directly ignoring the economic impacts, inefficiencies of electric heat and corporatism it creates. It will unduly hurt senior citizens as well as lower income neighborhoods who are forced to downgrade the reliability and efficiency of their heat source. Not only that, the Power provider for the city acquires 35% of its power generation from Coal which is a disaster of a fuel.

Legal citizens/immigrants. Any policy (for example AOC wanted economic relief for Illegal Aliens residing in the states) that provides tax payer benefits to illegal aliens is a direct marginalization of not only U.S. Born citizens but absolutely an affront and slap in the face to those who worked very hard to come to our nation legally. (Note: Dreamers are an entirely different discussion and a very difficult problem to solve that is sad in every way. I also think that legal immigration is entirely too difficult.) 

It is not that certain Liberals specifically point at a race and say, ""you bad"". It is that they create policies that directly make classes of people lives worse even if their intention is good.

Further although I have seen certain Republicans denounce illegal immigrants of certain races, I have not see (even Trump) denounce legal immigrants of any race (happy to have links that prove me wrong). 

There are good things that Liberals do. I happily admit that. I don't vote for a party, I vote for a candidate that I believe can do good things (For example, I voted for Obama in 2012, Johnson in 2016).

Lastly, because I think it will come up. Calling the Coronavirus the China Virus is not racist. It is a direct and truthful attack on the CCP and their origination of not only the current pandemic but 2009 as well, not the Chinese people. I am in China at least once a year and the people are the nicest, most gracious people that I have ever met (outside of maybe the Italians, even the old lady in the restaurant that yells at me to eat :P I know she means it with love.)

I hope I have answered your question and would be happy to continue constructive discourse."

- *""Announcing a public health emergency of international concern, or PHEIC, grants the WHO director-general certain powers, including the ability to issue recommendations for how countries should respond"".*

- *""Public Health Event of International Concern (PHEIC), triggering the aid system to intervene in full force.""* That's not something you can just declare willy-winny.

At the time they'd just reached *400 cases* and *14 deaths* while infections were sitting at *3* just *a week* before. WHO had made a strong call to action almost a month prior, and given a warning 6 weeks before. Those that didn't listen and are now swamped have only themselves to blame, WHO did its job."

###Tips For Social Distancing, Quarantine, And Isolation During An Infectious Disease Outbreak

**What Is Social Distancing?**

Social distancing is a way to keep people from interacting closely or frequently enough to spread an infectious disease. Schools and other gathering places such as movie theaters may close, and sports events and religious services may be cancelled.

**What Is Quarantine?**

Quarantine separates and restricts the movement of people who have been exposed to a contagious disease to see if they become sick. It lasts long enough to ensure the person has not contracted an infectious disease.

**What Is Isolation?**

Isolation prevents the spread of an infectious disease by separating people who are sick from those who are not. It lasts as long as the disease is contagious.

##What To Expect: Typical Reactions

Everyone reacts differently to stressful situations such as an infectious disease outbreak that requires social distancing, quarantine, or isolation. People may feel:

- **Anxiety, worry, or fear related to**:  
- Your own health status  
- The health status of others whom you may have exposed to the disease  
- The resentment that your friends and family may feel if they need to go into quarantine as a result of contact with you  
- The experience of monitoring yourself, or being monitored by others for signs and symptoms of the disease  
- Time taken off from work and the potential loss of income and job security  
- The challenges of securing things you need, such as groceries and personal care items  
- **Concern** about being able to effectively care for children or others in your care  
- **Uncertainty or frustration** about how long you will need to remain in this situation, and uncertainty about the future  
- **Loneliness** associated with feeling cut off from the world and from loved ones  
- **Anger** if you think you were exposed to the disease because of others’ negligence  
- **Boredom and frustration** because you may not be able to work or engage in regular day-to-day activities  
- **Uncertainty or ambivalence** about the situation  
- **A desire** to use alcohol or drugs to cope  
- **Symptoms of depression**, such as feelings of hopelessness, changes in appetite, or sleeping too little or too much  
- **Symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD)**, such as intrusive distressing memories, flashbacks (reliving the event), nightmares, changes in thoughts and mood, and being easily startled.

##Ways To Support Yourself During Social Distancing, Quarantine, and Isolation

#UNDERSTAND THE RISK

Consider the real risk of harm to yourself and others around you. The public perception of risk during a situation such as an infectious disease outbreak is often inaccurate. Media coverage may create the impression that people are in immediate danger when really the risk for infection may be very low. Take steps to get the facts:

- Stay up to date on what is happening, while limiting your media exposure. Avoid watching or listening to news reports 24/7 since this tends to increase anxiety and worry. Remember that children are especially affected by what they hear and see on television.  
- Look to credible sources for information on the infectious disease outbreak.

#BE YOUR OWN ADVOCATE

Speaking out about your needs is particularly important if you are in quarantine, since you may not be in a hospital or other facility where your basic needs are met. Ensure you have what you need to feel safe, secure, and comfortable.

- Work with local, state, or national health officials to find out how you can arrange for groceries and toiletries to be delivered to your home as needed.  
- Inform health care providers or health authorities of any needed medications and work with them to ensure that you continue to receive those medications.

#EDUCATE YOURSELF

Health care providers and health authorities should provide information on the disease, its diagnosis, and treatment.

- Do not be afraid to ask questions—clear communication with a health care provider may help reduce any distress associated with social distancing, quarantine, or isolation.  
- Ask for written information when available.  
- Ask a family member or friend to obtain information in the event that you are unable to secure this information on your own.

#WORK WITH YOUR EMPLOYER TO REDUCE FINANCIAL STRESS

If you’re unable to work during this time, you may experience stress related to your job status or financial situation.

- Provide your employer with a clear explanation of why you are away from work.  
- Contact the U.S. Department of Labor tollfree at 1-866-487-2365 about the Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA), which allows U.S. employees up to 12 weeks of unpaid leave for serious medical conditions, or to care for a family member with a serious medical condition.  
- Contact your utility providers, cable and Internet provider, and other companies from whom you get monthly bills to explain your situation and request alternative bill payment arrangements as needed.

#CONNECT WITH OTHERS

Reaching out to people you trust is one of the best ways to reduce anxiety, depression, loneliness, and boredom during social distancing, quarantine, and isolation. You can:

- Use the telephone, email, text messaging, and social media to connect with friends, family, and others.  
- Talk “face to face” with friends and loved ones using Skype or FaceTime.  
- If approved by health authorities and your health care providers, arrange for your friends and loved ones to bring you newspapers, movies, and books.  
- Sign up for emergency alerts via text or email to ensure you get updates as soon as they are available.  
- Call SAMHSA’s free 24-hour Disaster Distress Helpline at 1-800-985-5990, if you feel lonely or need support.  
- Use the Internet, radio, and television to keep up with local, national, and world events.  
- If you need to connect with someone because of an ongoing alcohol or drug problem, consider calling your local Alcoholics Anonymous or Narcotics Anonymous offices.

#TALK TO YOUR DOCTOR

If you are in a medical facility, you may have access to health care providers who can answer your questions. However, if you are quarantined at home, and you’re worried about physical symptoms you or your loved ones may be experiencing, call your doctor or other health care provider:

- Ask your provider whether it would be possible to schedule remote appointments via Skype or FaceTime for mental health, substance use, or physical health needs.

#USE PRACTICAL WAYS TO COPE AND RELAX

- Relax your body often by doing things that work for you-take deep breaths, stretch, meditate or pray, or engage in activities you enjoy.  
- Pace yourself between stressful activities, and do something fun after a hard task.  
- Talk about your experiences and feelings to loved ones and friends, if you find it helpful.  
- Maintain a sense of hope and positive thinking; consider keeping a journal where you write down things you are grateful for or that are going well

2020-04-11,Duese,AdviceAnimals,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/AdviceAnimals/comments/fyvy7z/ah_the_good_old_days/fn3gbpi/,"I'm not tracking the spread, I'm reducing the spread.  Notice how those words are different, ""track"" versus ""reduce""?  We know HOW the virus spreads and because of how this virus spreads, preventing the spread is impossible.  

Perhaps you've heard the term ""flatten the curve"".  It's a pretty popular buzz phrase recently.  Now, ask yourself, does that mean you are trying to prevent the spread or control the spread?  The entire idea of the curve is that you are managing the speed of the infection rather than trying to outright stop the spread.

Further to that, the entire concept of flattening the curve is to make it so as the virus spreads, we can maintain our resources without overwhelming them.  Once again, it's not about stopping the spread of the virus but preventing the speed at which it spreads.

Right now, if we had some omniscient way to see just how many people have or had coronavirus in the US, I would not be shocked to see that number be 20 times the number of cases we've tested positive right now.  The one thing that is certain though is that anyone who is showing non-minor symptoms IS going to doctors and they are getting counted in the infected, critical and death counts.  If anything, these are being overcounted."
2020-04-11,TrueIndologyBot,DDnews,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/DDnews/comments/fz82ni/govt_issues_guidelines_on_blood_donation_amid/fn3gszi/,"**Summary:** 

According to the guidelines, a person who has travel history, contact history or confirmed case of novel coronavirus, has to be excluded from blood donation.
Social distancing measures should be followed in the blood donation site.
They also said that if a donor reports back to the blood centre or camp organiser within 14 days of donating the blood, experiencing illness suspected to be Covid-19 or is confirmed positive case of coronavirus or his close contact being confirmed with the infection post donation, he must be referred appropriately for further management by the Blood Centre Medical Officer.
The blood or blood components collected from such individuals should be discarded.
Haemovigilance should continue to capture and analyse any adverse events which are associated with blood and blood component transfusion including post donation and post transfusion infections should be reported to Haemovigilance Programme of India (HvPI) of National Institute of Biologicals (NIB) with copies to representative State Blood Transfusion Council (SBTC) and State Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and properly investigated.
National Blood Transfusion Council of India Director, Dr Shobini Rajan directed all states AIDS control societies and state blood transfusion councils to adapt the guidance.
""Requests have been received from several stakeholders engaged with managing blood centres and blood transfusion services regarding concerns with maintaining safety and adequacy of blood during this period of restricted gathering and social distancing,"" she said.
Rajan also said that blood centres world over are dependent on voluntary blood donation from healthy individuals to meet their blood supply. Since the demand for blood and blood components continues, especially for those patients depending on blood transfusions as a life saving measure like thalassemics, accident victims, pregnant women and critically sick patients, it is essential that the supply of safe blood continue to be maintained at licensed blood centres in the country."

China fucked up... shocker but this isn’t China’s problem anymore. I’m not a citizen of China so the moment that shit left there and came here if became our problem to deal with. America getting fucked by the coronavirus is because of America’s response; and who was in charge of that response? Trump. 

You can’t blame the virus on the CCP (China’s leading political party) and not also blame America’s response on the Republicans (our version of the CCP). The Republican Party through Trump, Fox News, and other individuals stripped our nations defenses, underfunded key institutions, neutered the CDC, lied about the virus existing, lied about the severity of the virus after they acknowledged it, pushed information that didn’t line up with health official stances, didn’t want to close the country (still haven’t federally), pushed hard for a drug that may or may not do anything (but is made by a firm with ties to Trump), and generally just fucked everything up. 

Stop with the whataboutism, America’s current situation is entirely the result of a weak and at times incorrect response to the situation. As an American that’s what I’m going to focus on, I always assume China lies but we’re not talking about China. China’s response has nothing to do with the American response to the situation. Republicans love to talk about how China lied about all this shit and completely ignore they also lied about this (they lied about how severe it is, they lied about numbers by not letting people be tested, the are still not be honest with numbers because we aren’t doing enough testing). Are you a Chinese citizen or an American; if you’re an American you should care about America’s response first and foremost. 

The reason everyone in America is focusing on what America has done (and the failures/lies of the Trump admin and conservative media) is because we’re fucking Americans and that is what directly affects our country and people. Fuck the CCP but this became Trump’s problem as soon as it hit our shores and he’s dropped the fucking ball (his party actually made it worse by lying about its existence and severity)."

It’s not like if there was a 25% risk she’d get   a 25% case of coronavirus. Now it’s real, she already did it, so all that matters is dealing with the outcome. There’s no point worrying about the risk now. 

Once you roll the dice it only matters what number it lands on, not the probability of all the numbers it could have landed on.

Stating that there was no need to panic on their availability, the Union Health Ministry said it was not required by everyone involved in coronavirus infection treatment.
Agarwal said, while the government was augmenting the PPE supply, its use was based on the risk profile. ""The PPE is meant for high risk profile patients and not for patients with low and moderate risk,"" he said.
The PPE is not only coverall, but a mix of boot, coverall, head gear and N95 mask. While high risk patients needed full component, for the moderate risk patients mask and gloves were sufficient, he said.
""We have procured sufficient quantities of the PPE and provided them to the state governments. Rationalisation should be exercised in its usage"", Agarwal said.
Agarwal said the meeting of the Group of Ministers (GoM), comprising health, civil aviation, external affairs, home, chemical, shipping and fertilizer Ministers, focused on containment and management efforts. It also took up dedicated Covid-19 hospitals, availability of PPE, ventilators and N95 masks.
He said the GoM emphasised that doctors were like soldiers and they needed the community support, and also the people should not believe fake news as information could be accessed through call centres of the central and the state governments.
Citing the government guidelines, he said the PPE should be made available to medical staff and be used rationally. Agarwal said the Indian Railways had produced about 600,000 reusable face masks and over 4,000 litres of hand sanitiser, and deployed more than 2,500 doctors, 35,000 paramedics.
It had sanctioned nearly 5,000 coaches to be converted into 80,000 isolation beds. Of this, 3,250 coaches had already been converted into isolation stations, he added.
The GoM also directed that Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) should be utilised as per prescription and is not advised for patients with cardiac irregularities or those suffering from cardiac disease which can be harmful.
The Health Ministry also cited the ''adopt a family program'', amid the lockdown, in Karnal district, where local businessmen and those living abroad, have contributed generously to adopt needy families.
""Rs 64 lakhs has been raised, which will take care of 13,000 poorest families throughout the district. Efforts are also being made to distribute 90,000 meals per day to vulnerable groups. Technology such as dedicated ''Karnal Live Tracker'' to track the home quarantines & also an online local delivery app ''Need on Wheels (NOW) have been facilitated by the local district administration to procure vegetable/fruit wholesalers & dairies"", said the ministry in a statement."

In all, 41 cases of pneumonia - a symptom of the disease - have been reported in the central Chinese city of Wuhan, mainly through exposure at a seafood market.

> Dr. Maria Van Kerkhove, acting head of WHO’s emerging diseases unit, told a Geneva news briefing that the agency had given guidance to hospitals worldwide about infection control in case of spread, including by a “super-spreading” event in a health care setting. “This is something on our radar, it is possible, we need to prepare ourselves,” she said. 

Like I said: WHO reported limited human-to-human transmission on Jan 14th. Their press briefings that day included, as noted in this report, that sustained human-to-human transmission was on their radar and that the world needed to prepare.

You can't blame the doctors either. In some govt hospitals they literally don't pay any salary. Would you work for free? And yet doctors do, in Gandhi hospital in Hyderabad there are doctors battling coronavirus for zero money. But none of them would blame a colleague for opting to put their education in the private sector instead. Besides which most doctors don't only run private clinics but split their weeks between a bigger hospital and their own clinic. 

It isnt ""playing a blame game"" to hold the govt accountable and demand transparency for the taxes we pay and to demand that our doctors are incentivized to stay in the public sector and demand that every child have access to quality education."

To that end we are requiring that all comments be a minimum of 5,000 characters to ensure that there is a safe distance between users at all times. Please help us by ensuring that your commentary meets this minimum requirement. Attempts to circumvent this will see users quarantined from the subreddit. 

###Tips For Social Distancing, Quarantine, And Isolation During An Infectious Disease Outbreak

**What Is Social Distancing?**

Social distancing is a way to keep people from interacting closely or frequently enough to spread an infectious disease. Schools and other gathering places such as movie theaters may close, and sports events and religious services may be cancelled.

**What Is Quarantine?**

Quarantine separates and restricts the movement of people who have been exposed to a contagious disease to see if they become sick. It lasts long enough to ensure the person has not contracted an infectious disease.

**What Is Isolation?**

Isolation prevents the spread of an infectious disease by separating people who are sick from those who are not. It lasts as long as the disease is contagious.

##What To Expect: Typical Reactions

Everyone reacts differently to stressful situations such as an infectious disease outbreak that requires social distancing, quarantine, or isolation. People may feel:

- **Anxiety, worry, or fear related to**:  
- Your own health status  
- The health status of others whom you may have exposed to the disease  
- The resentment that your friends and family may feel if they need to go into quarantine as a result of contact with you  
- The experience of monitoring yourself, or being monitored by others for signs and symptoms of the disease  
- Time taken off from work and the potential loss of income and job security  
- The challenges of securing things you need, such as groceries and personal care items  
- **Concern** about being able to effectively care for children or others in your care  
- **Uncertainty or frustration** about how long you will need to remain in this situation, and uncertainty about the future  
- **Loneliness** associated with feeling cut off from the world and from loved ones  
- **Anger** if you think you were exposed to the disease because of others’ negligence  
- **Boredom and frustration** because you may not be able to work or engage in regular day-to-day activities  
- **Uncertainty or ambivalence** about the situation  
- **A desire** to use alcohol or drugs to cope  
- **Symptoms of depression**, such as feelings of hopelessness, changes in appetite, or sleeping too little or too much  
- **Symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD)**, such as intrusive distressing memories, flashbacks (reliving the event), nightmares, changes in thoughts and mood, and being easily startled.

##Ways To Support Yourself During Social Distancing, Quarantine, and Isolation

#UNDERSTAND THE RISK

Consider the real risk of harm to yourself and others around you. The public perception of risk during a situation such as an infectious disease outbreak is often inaccurate. Media coverage may create the impression that people are in immediate danger when really the risk for infection may be very low. Take steps to get the facts:

- Stay up to date on what is happening, while limiting your media exposure. Avoid watching or listening to news reports 24/7 since this tends to increase anxiety and worry. Remember that children are especially affected by what they hear and see on television.  
- Look to credible sources for information on the infectious disease outbreak.

#BE YOUR OWN ADVOCATE

Speaking out about your needs is particularly important if you are in quarantine, since you may not be in a hospital or other facility where your basic needs are met. Ensure you have what you need to feel safe, secure, and comfortable.

- Work with local, state, or national health officials to find out how you can arrange for groceries and toiletries to be delivered to your home as needed.  
- Inform health care providers or health authorities of any needed medications and work with them to ensure that you continue to receive those medications.

#EDUCATE YOURSELF

Health care providers and health authorities should provide information on the disease, its diagnosis, and treatment.

- Do not be afraid to ask questions—clear communication with a health care provider may help reduce any distress associated with social distancing, quarantine, or isolation.  
- Ask for written information when available.  
- Ask a family member or friend to obtain information in the event that you are unable to secure this information on your own.

#WORK WITH YOUR EMPLOYER TO REDUCE FINANCIAL STRESS

If you’re unable to work during this time, you may experience stress related to your job status or financial situation.

- Provide your employer with a clear explanation of why you are away from work.  
- Contact the U.S. Department of Labor tollfree at 1-866-487-2365 about the Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA), which allows U.S. employees up to 12 weeks of unpaid leave for serious medical conditions, or to care for a family member with a serious medical condition.  
- Contact your utility providers, cable and Internet provider, and other companies from whom you get monthly bills to explain your situation and request alternative bill payment arrangements as needed.

#CONNECT WITH OTHERS

Reaching out to people you trust is one of the best ways to reduce anxiety, depression, loneliness, and boredom during social distancing, quarantine, and isolation. You can:

- Use the telephone, email, text messaging, and social media to connect with friends, family, and others.  
- Talk “face to face” with friends and loved ones using Skype or FaceTime.  
- If approved by health authorities and your health care providers, arrange for your friends and loved ones to bring you newspapers, movies, and books.  
- Sign up for emergency alerts via text or email to ensure you get updates as soon as they are available.  
- Call SAMHSA’s free 24-hour Disaster Distress Helpline at 1-800-985-5990, if you feel lonely or need support.  
- Use the Internet, radio, and television to keep up with local, national, and world events.  
- If you need to connect with someone because of an ongoing alcohol or drug problem, consider calling your local Alcoholics Anonymous or Narcotics Anonymous offices.

#TALK TO YOUR DOCTOR

If you are in a medical facility, you may have access to health care providers who can answer your questions. However, if you are quarantined at home, and you’re worried about physical symptoms you or your loved ones may be experiencing, call your doctor or other health care provider:

- Ask your provider whether it would be possible to schedule remote appointments via Skype or FaceTime for mental health, substance use, or physical health needs.

#USE PRACTICAL WAYS TO COPE AND RELAX

- Relax your body often by doing things that work for you-take deep breaths, stretch, meditate or pray, or engage in activities you enjoy.  
- Pace yourself between stressful activities, and do something fun after a hard task.  
- Talk about your experiences and feelings to loved ones and friends, if you find it helpful.  
- Maintain a sense of hope and positive thinking; consider keeping a journal where you write down things you are grateful for or that are going well

Everything that I've replaced since I've owned it in the last 7 years was replaced, I believe, due to age and not due to manufacture. Every time I go into the shop for an oil change they tell me something else needs to be replaced or something is leaking, and the next oil change it's something else that's broken or leaking. Transmission, then tie bars, then oil/coolant/steering fluid (they couldn't tell and wanted to charge hundreds just to find out). 

I'm in the market for a new car soon anyway (definitely not a Ford), and there's enough broken about the car that doesn't impact its driving (two windows don't roll down, airbag light has been on for at least 2 years - I think both are non-functional, CD changer sometimes jams, timing belt rattles like hell when the AC is on, exterior rust), so I've made an agreement with myself to only put in money for gas and windshield wipers until it breaks down and try to get at least $600 for it sometime in the winter. Due to Coronavirus, I've already cut down on that for the last month!

>> En su intervención, el presidente **Alberto Fernández afirmó que “una de las más grandes tragedias que ha traído el capitalismo es la falta de solidaridad en el crecimiento**” y, en ese sentido, reiteró: “Si algo bueno se puede sacar de esta tragedia, es que **acá nadie se salva solo”**, en referencia a la pandemia de coronavirus que afecta a la Argentina y al mundo.

We are pushed both culturally and financially, due to our debt, to continue to combat coronavirus on the front lines. On average, residents are compensated less by the hour than the majority of hospital staff. Additionally, medical students are PAYING to be providers. This is unjust.

""Since 1877 Wimbledon fans have embraced The Championships,"" Federer says in the video. ""You have watched through multiple types of screen at all hours of the day and night. Descended from afar. Even queued. My, how you have queued. This summer sadly, we must come together by staying apart. No tents will be pitched, no records broken, no trophies engraved.

Two reasons this was controversial in The Great Recession was that 1) some companies used some of this money for executive compensation, and 2) we were bailing out most of the same financial institutions that created the crisis.  But the alternative to this was to have banks fail totally and really have a collapse of the financial system in the country.

Right now in Coronavirus the point of the bailouts is to 1) provide cash flow to companies affected directly by the shutdowns (I’m not sure exactly on the lending terms), and 2) make sure that the health crisis does not turn into a financial crisis by seizing up everyone’s ability to borrow and withdraw cash."

###Tips For Social Distancing, Quarantine, And Isolation During An Infectious Disease Outbreak

**What Is Social Distancing?**

Social distancing is a way to keep people from interacting closely or frequently enough to spread an infectious disease. Schools and other gathering places such as movie theaters may close, and sports events and religious services may be cancelled.

**What Is Quarantine?**

Quarantine separates and restricts the movement of people who have been exposed to a contagious disease to see if they become sick. It lasts long enough to ensure the person has not contracted an infectious disease.

**What Is Isolation?**

Isolation prevents the spread of an infectious disease by separating people who are sick from those who are not. It lasts as long as the disease is contagious.

##What To Expect: Typical Reactions

Everyone reacts differently to stressful situations such as an infectious disease outbreak that requires social distancing, quarantine, or isolation. People may feel:

- **Anxiety, worry, or fear related to**:  
- Your own health status  
- The health status of others whom you may have exposed to the disease  
- The resentment that your friends and family may feel if they need to go into quarantine as a result of contact with you  
- The experience of monitoring yourself, or being monitored by others for signs and symptoms of the disease  
- Time taken off from work and the potential loss of income and job security  
- The challenges of securing things you need, such as groceries and personal care items  
- **Concern** about being able to effectively care for children or others in your care  
- **Uncertainty or frustration** about how long you will need to remain in this situation, and uncertainty about the future  
- **Loneliness** associated with feeling cut off from the world and from loved ones  
- **Anger** if you think you were exposed to the disease because of others’ negligence  
- **Boredom and frustration** because you may not be able to work or engage in regular day-to-day activities  
- **Uncertainty or ambivalence** about the situation  
- **A desire** to use alcohol or drugs to cope  
- **Symptoms of depression**, such as feelings of hopelessness, changes in appetite, or sleeping too little or too much  
- **Symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD)**, such as intrusive distressing memories, flashbacks (reliving the event), nightmares, changes in thoughts and mood, and being easily startled.

##Ways To Support Yourself During Social Distancing, Quarantine, and Isolation

#UNDERSTAND THE RISK

Consider the real risk of harm to yourself and others around you. The public perception of risk during a situation such as an infectious disease outbreak is often inaccurate. Media coverage may create the impression that people are in immediate danger when really the risk for infection may be very low. Take steps to get the facts:

- Stay up to date on what is happening, while limiting your media exposure. Avoid watching or listening to news reports 24/7 since this tends to increase anxiety and worry. Remember that children are especially affected by what they hear and see on television.  
- Look to credible sources for information on the infectious disease outbreak.

#BE YOUR OWN ADVOCATE

Speaking out about your needs is particularly important if you are in quarantine, since you may not be in a hospital or other facility where your basic needs are met. Ensure you have what you need to feel safe, secure, and comfortable.

- Work with local, state, or national health officials to find out how you can arrange for groceries and toiletries to be delivered to your home as needed.  
- Inform health care providers or health authorities of any needed medications and work with them to ensure that you continue to receive those medications.

#EDUCATE YOURSELF

Health care providers and health authorities should provide information on the disease, its diagnosis, and treatment.

- Do not be afraid to ask questions—clear communication with a health care provider may help reduce any distress associated with social distancing, quarantine, or isolation.  
- Ask for written information when available.  
- Ask a family member or friend to obtain information in the event that you are unable to secure this information on your own.

#WORK WITH YOUR EMPLOYER TO REDUCE FINANCIAL STRESS

If you’re unable to work during this time, you may experience stress related to your job status or financial situation.

- Provide your employer with a clear explanation of why you are away from work.  
- Contact the U.S. Department of Labor tollfree at 1-866-487-2365 about the Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA), which allows U.S. employees up to 12 weeks of unpaid leave for serious medical conditions, or to care for a family member with a serious medical condition.  
- Contact your utility providers, cable and Internet provider, and other companies from whom you get monthly bills to explain your situation and request alternative bill payment arrangements as needed.

#CONNECT WITH OTHERS

Reaching out to people you trust is one of the best ways to reduce anxiety, depression, loneliness, and boredom during social distancing, quarantine, and isolation. You can:

- Use the telephone, email, text messaging, and social media to connect with friends, family, and others.  
- Talk “face to face” with friends and loved ones using Skype or FaceTime.  
- If approved by health authorities and your health care providers, arrange for your friends and loved ones to bring you newspapers, movies, and books.  
- Sign up for emergency alerts via text or email to ensure you get updates as soon as they are available.  
- Call SAMHSA’s free 24-hour Disaster Distress Helpline at 1-800-985-5990, if you feel lonely or need support.  
- Use the Internet, radio, and television to keep up with local, national, and world events.  
- If you need to connect with someone because of an ongoing alcohol or drug problem, consider calling your local Alcoholics Anonymous or Narcotics Anonymous offices.

#TALK TO YOUR DOCTOR

If you are in a medical facility, you may have access to health care providers who can answer your questions. However, if you are quarantined at home, and you’re worried about physical symptoms you or your loved ones may be experiencing, call your doctor or other health care provider:

- Ask your provider whether it would be possible to schedule remote appointments via Skype or FaceTime for mental health, substance use, or physical health needs.

#USE PRACTICAL WAYS TO COPE AND RELAX

- Relax your body often by doing things that work for you-take deep breaths, stretch, meditate or pray, or engage in activities you enjoy.  
- Pace yourself between stressful activities, and do something fun after a hard task.  
- Talk about your experiences and feelings to loved ones and friends, if you find it helpful.  
- Maintain a sense of hope and positive thinking; consider keeping a journal where you write down things you are grateful for or that are going well

https://amp.cnn.com/cnn/2020/04/11/politics/donald-trump-coronavirus-economy-testing/index.html

This is why we are now facing the serious issue of considering when to ease the lockdowns/shutdowns before an overwhelmingly higher and more diverse range of lives are economically, psychollogically ruined and therefore lost, than to coronavirus. 

I've followed the Coronavirus Pandemic closely since the beginning in Wuhan China, to the first community spreads in the U.S. around (if i recall correctly) Valentine's Day (Feb. 14th),  to the first 10, 100 deaths, and so on. I've taken the guidelines and orders as necessary, and was personally wearing surgical masks well before the CDC finally came out like a week and a half ago to declare that ""yeah maybe the public should wear masks"".

However, it is now just as important to have a mature discussion over the catastrophic economic impact that keeping the nation shutdown for too long will have. Not the economic impact on the Stock Market, but the way that millions of living, working, and young Americans will be financially ruined. Unemployment claims have already skyrocketed to historic rates. 

At some point, how far longer down the road will we continue to shut out any idea of soon opening up the country as ""sacrificing our grandparents"", and instead realize that our friends and family, and many among us, have already been left out in the dust long enough to lose their jobs and next their assets and homes, and way of life? 

I just got my first job out of college back in November. Crazy to think that the Coronavirus outbreak has been spreading since its imception for essentially during my whole time at work so far, having just hit home the last 2 months. I was actually very scared and even depressed when first hearing of the closure of businesses. I thought, ""it would be my awful luck that I lose the job that I had worked so hard for and spent 4 months completing job applications for"". Before my job I was a broke mess and hating life, getting high and believing my degree was never going to help me get a decent job. No car, living on the couch of my parent's low income studio apartment, just pathetic. I couldn't imagine suddenly losing my job and therefore only having a mere 5 month taste of how normal and successful my life could have been, losing my car, phone, and everything. 

Fortunately, my company is considered essential in the ""semiconductor engineering industry, while also not having to be around the public. However, the scare was real especially because I was broke for such a while and nearly homeless. I feel so much for the poor Americans who only wish to be able to go back to their normal routine of working, only to have their lives devastated to a state worse than I was. 

I see the dreamy suggestions here of ""simply freezing rent payments"", ""simply freezing loan payments"", pretty much any other debt inducing idea besides actually considering the real necessity to open up the nation's economy and businesses as soon as safely possible. 

It is true that ""staying home"" will cost lives in the near term, and far more than coronavirus. Especially given the typical demographics of redditors, I am surprised to not see more on here voicing their concern and desire to retake control of their livelihoods than to be fed with the prospect of having to waste away for 2 months or more. Perhaps the redditors who are most concerned about their own livelihood and survival are on kther subreddits lile r/coronavirusrecession."

This is on top of the fact that Donald said in February  that no1 had really heard about it.

In early January trump was briefed about this several times. Just take that in, you can go look it's true.
In late January the WHO declared global health emergency. 

There are loads of videos an articles about Chinese doctors sacrificing their life to warn us about corona virus despite the communist party, and they succeeded. 

Him blaming China is a political move, he is trying to use the virus for his political agenda. Trump not long ago loved the WHO.

The WHO is crooked that's for sure. But he didn't call them that before, he does now that he responded late. And with many other western countries responding months before he did, how can you blame China? Did China secretly brief European countries in an attack on the states? No, their leaders just took it serious."

Then in fall you play half your league seasons matches 2 per week over 2 months in Sept and October. You can then spend November quarantining and centralized CL group stage. March and April you repeat league 2nd half and May CL knockouts. The TV money is too big to cancel the seasons. No fans. Extreme quarantining and testing with as many breaks as possible for players to see family or quarantining families with players.

I'm Canadian as most of you know, and socially there are some difference we have from Americans.

The one that seems to stand out is that my perception of Americans is that in a social sense, they have been conditioned to believe that they need to ""go out and get it"" and the American dream is liberty and wealth. The idea of ""manifest destiny"" comes to mind, especially in the sense that it is self looking out for the interests only of self, with little regard to outside factors.

And this is where the coronavirus comes in.

Do you think this is difficult for Americans to handle because of the social conditioning? Do you think otherwise. I'm curious to know."

Sorry to hear you've got the same shitshow over there!!!

Yes, downgraded BEFORE lockdown but of course the MSM didn't report that!

Like you, still know of absolutely nobody in real life who has it or knows about anyone who does
On FB I have just over 4k friends and same story there... although of course you get the odd person who pops up saying 'oh, my brother's wife's sisters husbands mother has it' lol but even if they DO, the tests aren't testing for cov-19 specific and they are hugely unreliable

UK is under the same CDC or WHO directives to classify deaths as cov-19, even PRESUMPTIVELY without a test!!! Even if they have multiple conditions, a third-level contributory factor of Covid-19 is logged as a C19 death! So misleading

It's absolutely appalling and as usual MSM aren't reporting the good news (ie low death rates high recovery) - damn if daily flu death rates were beamed onto the TV daily it would look no different!

We don't lock our countries and economies down for something with rates like this

I've been warning on FB for years now that this was coming, oh how they laughed at us ☹️ some are STILL laughing, saying we are crazies and ""we'll be off lockdown soon' well hell, guess what check this one out

As President Trump has flirted with reopening America quickly — saying in late March that he’d like to see “packed churches” on Easter and returning to the theme days ago with “we cannot let this continue” — public-health experts have felt compelled to call out the dangers. Many Americans have responded by rejecting as monstrous the whole idea of any trade-off between saving lives and saving the economy. And in the near term, it’s true that those two goals align: For the sake of both, it’s imperative to keep businesses shuttered and people in their homes as much as possible.

In the longer run, though, it’s important to acknowledge that a trade-off will emerge — and become more urgent in the coming months, as the economy slides deeper into recession. The staggering toll of unemployment has reached more than 16 million in just the last three weeks. There will be difficult compromises between doing everything possible to save lives from Covid-19 and preventing other life-threatening, or -altering, harms.

When can we ethically bring people back to work and school and begin to resume the usual rhythms of American life? We brought together by video conference five different kinds of experts to talk about the principles and values that will determine the choices we make at that future point. One of them, the bioethicist Zeke Emanuel, led a group from the Center for American Progress that earlier this month presented a plan to end the coronavirus crisis. First, the group said, the country needs a national stay-at-home policy through mid-May. (Eight governors still haven’t issued such orders statewide.) In the intervening weeks, testing would have to ramp up to test everyone who has a fever, or lives with someone who tests positive for Covid-19. Contact-tracing — identifying and notifying people who have been in proximity to someone infected — would become comprehensive. People who have the virus or a fever, or those in proximity to them, would be isolated. There would also be testing of a representative sample in every county, to determine the rate of infection in the population, as well as mapping and alerts to inform the public about the location of Covid-19 cases.

If these efforts are successfully put in place, Emanuel hopes the current restrictions could begin to ease in June. At that point — or later, if the necessary steps have not been taken — we will need to rethink how we manage risk, recognizing trade-offs among various harms and benefits. That’s what the panel discussed."

Trump is probably the only choice this time again. I definitely side republican now since Hillary has destroyed potential good candidate from the dems. Often times I feel war heroes or servicemen/women should be the vice presidents because they can provide a better light on foreign policy, while the civilian bred presidents can take care of internal matters or discuss on both.   
I guess this is more of a vent, but can we all have a say in how these debates are conducted and maybe have a longer form discussion? Our views have come to a boiling point of division now, and that's just un American... I hope we gather and rally together through all this , and focus on health, safety and security. Maybe don't have to provide a doctor -- but a framework.  


If we can come to consensus to solve something like this : Say you're out of a job and you fall sick. you've been hunting for a gig, work the odd job and pay off some bills. but medication and stuff costs and doctors appts cost too. you manage for a month or two and then you're in terrible debt.   
Now of course, we're going down the UBI route with the coronavirus - which tells us that dang it's doable.   
Andrew yang, Tulsi Gabbard had such better opinions and policies - a mix of that with Trumps business outlook would've done us good.   
I hope we all come out stronger ."
2020-04-11,axolotl_peyotl,conspiracy,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/fz7uj8/covid_italy_update_dispelling_the_pandemic/fn3fquz/,">The following information on Italy is as of March 30. It comes from an article posted at Swiss Propaganda Research. It describes reports from the Italian National Health Institute. It confirms what I’ve been writing about Italy—which is:

>Take a population of many elderly people who already have serious, multiple, long-term health conditions, including lung conditions. Note that these people have already been treated with a number of toxic medical drugs. Add in very toxic air pollution in certain sectors of the country—which, in fact, accounts for a great amount of these lung problems. 

>Consider that pneumonia—said to be a cardinal feature of COVID-19—has been rampant in Italy for a long time, long before the emergence of the supposed coronavirus. Numbers of flu-like illness cases and pneumonia cases, going back before “the pandemic,” are huge. 

>These cases show the same general symptoms attributed to COVID. Finally, use a diagnostic test, which, as I’ve described, can rack up false-positives for reasons that have nothing to do with COVID…and you have the illusion of a new epidemic.

>“But…but what about the overflowing ICU wards in hospitals?”

>Think it through. Every elderly ill person with lung problems now fears he/she might “have the virus,” and so comes the flood of people to hospital. It’s no mystery.

>All right. Here are excerpts from the Swiss Propaganda Research article, [“Facts about Covid-19”](https://swprs.org/a-swiss-doctor-on-covid-19/):

“According to the latest data of the Italian National Health Institute ISS, the average age of the positively-tested deceased in Italy is currently about 81 years. 10% of the deceased are over 90 years old. 90% of the deceased are over 70 years old.”

“80% of the deceased had suffered from two or more chronic diseases. 50% of the deceased had suffered from three or more chronic diseases. The chronic diseases include in particular cardiovascular problems, diabetes, respiratory problems and cancer.”

“Less than 1% of the deceased were healthy persons, i.e. persons without pre-existing chronic diseases. Only about 30% of the deceased are women.”

“The Italian Institute of Health moreover distinguishes between those who died from the coronavirus and those who died with the coronavirus. In many cases it is not yet clear whether the persons died from the virus or from their pre-existing chronic diseases or from a combination of both.”

“The two Italians deceased [!!] under 40 years of age (both 39 years old) were a cancer patient and a diabetes patient with additional complications. In these cases, too, the exact cause of death was not yet clear (i.e. if from the virus or from their pre-existing diseases).”

“The partial overloading of the hospitals is due to the general rush of patients and the increased number of patients requiring special or intensive care. In particular, the aim is to stabilize respiratory function and, in severe cases, to provide [toxic] anti-viral therapies.”

“Northern Italy has one of the oldest populations and the worst air quality in Europe, which had already led to an increased number of respiratory diseases and deaths in the past and is likely an additional risk factor in the current epidemic.”

“South Korea, for instance, has experienced a much milder course than Italy and has already passed the peak of the epidemic. In South Korea, only about 70 deaths with a positive test result have been reported so far. As in Italy, those affected were mostly high-risk patients.”

“The few dozen test-positive Swiss deaths so far were also high-risk patients with chronic diseases, an average age of more than 80 years and a maximum age of 97 years, whose exact cause of death, i.e. from the virus or from their pre-existing diseases, is not yet known.”

>I’ll clarify a further point. Even if the diagnostic tests on patients claim to show the presence of the COVID-19 virus—and even if we accept that finding as true—the test has never been proved to be able to say HOW MUCH virus is in a patient’s body. 

>And that is vital, because, to even begin talking about a person actually getting sick, he would have to have millions and millions of virus actively replicating in his body. Therefore, the finding of the test is irrelevant in the real world, as opposed to the lab.

>In the real world, of which Italy is a part, people who are aged, who have multiple and very serious long-term health problems, who have been treated for years with toxic drugs—these people die of those factors. There is no need for a purportedly new virus to explain why they are dying.

>**The absolute fraud and crime involved here are enormous. The perpetrators, in their bubble of reputation, wall-to-wall false science, media robots, and government back-up will escape with their careers intact.**

>**But the truth has a way of toppling pedestals and the people who stand on them.**"

I never understand why anyone would want another person to do their research for them , as you can find most things on the net true or fake haha you want me to link to how they faked the moon landing ...I can do that ! haha

My point, with all due respect , is that all of us (me included) need to do our own research if we want to learn more. If it's a case of you have looked and can't find anything... then yes happy to help.  But we're all too dependent on random links which 90% of the time fit our arguments and agendas.

Key takeaways:
* Many of the infected showed no symptoms until it was far too late.
* There is a history of staffing shortages and unsatisfactory inspections by federal regulators.
* Guidance from state and federal officials to only test those with symptoms or travel histories to areas with known cases stayed in place until it was too late for the facility.

Respiratory specialist Mukherjee, 24, was back home after her trip to India, where she’d been carrying out charity work and was due to start back at Boston Pilgrim Hospital, Lincolnshire next week.
“I could not be prouder to be both Miss England and to serve something of great national pride like the NHS,” Bhasha tells the BBC Radio 1 Newsbeat.
She was in India as part of a humanitarian trip across Asia and was due to travel to countries including Pakistan.
After seeing the unfolding crisis in the UK, she wanted to “share the load”.
“I felt unfair getting dressed up in a place of safety while my colleagues were laying their lives on the frontline,” she said.
The NHS is adapting to rising coronavirus cases in the UK through staff redeployment and asking recently retired doctors and nurses to come back to work.
Currently, the beauty queen was sorting out the logistical issues of her return to work, including things like what shifts she would be be doing and where she would be living.
She’s currently self-isolating in her home city of Derby, which is around 80 miles from the hospital.
Mukherjee also knows the health risks of returning to the wards but is not worried about contracting the disease in the hospital.
“I could have caught it anytime or anywhere. I could have picked it up at any airport or while I was in India” she told the BBC.
“My main concern is the pressure our NHS is under.”
Bhasha was crowned Miss England in August 2019, shortly after gaining two medical degrees from the University of Nottingham.
She’d spent time training as a junior doctor on a respiratory ward, at the same time as modelling and taking part in pageants."

> # [Pandemia de desalojos – Socompa](http://socompa.info/social/735)
> 
>   
>   
> _Acorde con los tiempos pandémicos, un diálogo wasapeado con Deolinda Carrizo como protagonista, referente campesina de Santiago del Estero, donde la cuarentena ha detenido las actividades humanas pero no los desalojos y las usurpaciones a campesinos por los siniestros de siempre._
> 
> Deolinda Carrizo vive en Quimili, un pueblo rural y campesino de Santiago del Estero, ella misma es una campesina que cultiva su chacra y cría sus cerdos y cabras, pero también se da tiempo para militar y ser referente del Movimiento Nacional Campesino Indígena (MNCI – CLOC. La Vía Campesina) y es quien nos dice: “Acá somos unos 25.000 habitantes, de los cuales muchos trabajamos la tierras, pero otros dependen de las changas que tienen que ver con el trabajo rural y con la albañilería, pero con la cuarentena están imposibilitados de poder trabajar y dependen de los comedores, nosotros tenemos 6 comedores y merenderos que estamos atendiendo con las producciones de la agricultura familiar, al principio venían al comedor, pero ahora por las nuevas medidas, no los atendemos adentro sino que vienen a buscar la vianda y se la llevan. Cada vez viene más gente, algunos productores que tienen cultivos diversificados tienen menos problemas porque se pueden autoabastecer, pero otros no y están pasando muchas necesidades, porque no pueden movilizarse por los controles”.
> 
> [Image](http://socompa.info/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Vía-Campesina.jpg)
> 
> ### **Desalojos**
> 
> Deolinda la tiene muy clara, en cuanto a como viene la mano con el aprovechamiento del Coronavirus que hacen los inescrupulosos de siempre, a través de los audios de whatsapp me dice que: “Hay muchos empresarios que aprovechan la falta de control policial y están fumigando en zonas que no pueden hacerlo y otros, como en Sumampa, donde opera el empresario Vivas, ha organizado a grupos de matones para desalojar a familias de sus tierras, cosa que también sucede en Añatuya, donde fueron a la casa de unos campesinos vestidos de policías y con una orden judicial trucha, para echarlos. Esto también sucede en las zonas de Boquerón y en Bajo Hondo, donde el empresario Canido, logró que la jueza Falcón librara una orden de desalojo de una familia campesinas, la orden está y es posible que la cumplan, porque ya se han llevado compañeros detenidos durante cinco días con acusaciones falsas”. Esto no debería ocurrir y menos en una emergencia sanitaria como la que vivimos, Sin embargo no nos asombra que esto ocurra, el capitalismo es especialista en crear escenarios de debilidad para continuar con sus políticas de usurpación y saqueo.
> 
> ### **Escuelas**
> 
> Desde el estado se impulsó el cortar las clases en todo el sistema educativo, como medida para no propagar la pandemia, algo que da un mayor o menor buen resultado de aprendizaje, de acuerdo al grado de conectividad que tengan los alumnos. Pero en Quimili las cosas son diferentes según denuncia Deolinda: “El problema es que muchas de las escuelas no tienen electricidad ni señal de Wi Fi y la compra de tarjetas para conectarse a la red se hace cara, porque no hay ingresos y hay muchos alumnos que viven en lugares alejados y conectarse les es imposible, así tengan crédito en los celulares, esto es parte de la desigualdad que se vive en estos lugares, porque no es lo mismo el niño que está en una zona urbana a otro alejado de esas posibilidades, esto tendrá que ser resuelto, está problemática no es nueva y viene de hace mucho tiempo, pero se agravó durante los cuatro años de macrismo”.
> 
> ### **Solidaridad**
> 
> “Solo la ley del pobre, al pobre abriga”, dice un poema del poeta Higinio Mena y ese axioma expresado de modo poético, se hace realidad cuando se habla de agricultores familiares y campesinos, según nos cuenta Deolinda Carrizo, en otro de los audios enviados: “Nos parece bien que haya ciertos controles, pero hoy somos los campesinos los que estamos abasteciendo a los comedores, a los merenderos y a las ollas populares de la provincia, entonces no puede ser que el SENASA, salga a controlar y decomisar mercadería que va a los sectores más necesitados. Hoy las compañeras están armando bolsones con verduras para hacer venta domiciliaría y que la gente no tenga que salir de sus casas, lo hacen en vehículos propios y organizando como se pueda la logística para que todos puedan acceder a alimentos sanos y a precios justos. Ahí hay frutas y verduras que van del productor al consumidor y no son manipulados por intermediarios que aumentan los precios para enriquecerse”.
> 
> ### **Esperanza**
> 
> [Image](http://socompa.info/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/deolinda-carrizo.-1.jpg)Algunos suelen afirmar que una crisis es una oportunidad de cambio, Deolinda también lo afirma y sabe por dónde se deberá ir para que ese mentado cambio se produzca y nos aclara: “El Coronavirus es una enfermedad del sistema, creada por el sistema, pero ya vamos salir, porque vemos que la agricultura familiar es una herramienta importante para salir de todo esto, pero una vez que salgamos se tienen consolidar muchas cosas, que van de la mano de poner en funcionamiento la Ley de Reparación Histórica de la Agricultura Familiar, que haya una ley de tierras que beneficie al campesino, acá en Santiago hay muchas tierras fiscales que deben ser dadas a quienes quieran trabajar la tierra. Tiene que haber una ley de arraigo firme y verdadera, que permita la vuelta al campo de muchas familias que fueron despojadas de sus parcelas y que quieren trabajar la tierra como siempre lo hicieron. Para que eso ocurra solo falta la decisión política de hacerlo. Es una decisión política por el bien de todos, de la naturaleza, de la madre tierra, de la economía y por la soberanía alimentaria de los pueblos”.
> 
> ### **Comunicaciones** 
> 
> Desde mi casa me comunico con aquellos a quienes conozco y con quienes mantengo amistades y compañerismos políticos, literarios y de vida. A veces cualquier hora del día, la noche o la madrugada, en esta contingencia de horarios alterados por la cuarentena. No es el caso de esta Deolinda Carrizo, a la cual le envié la propuesta de la nota a mediodía y su respuesta después de dos horas fue: “Apenas me desocupe te llamo. Eso recién ocurrió a la nochecita como ella dice. A las 8 recibí una catarata de audios que respondieron mis preguntas. En el último además de saludarme, me decía: “Espero que todo lo que dije te haya servido, yo ahora tengo que atender a mi casa –atrás se escuchaba las voces de unos niños- y después descansar, porque empezamos bien temprano la tarea. De desalojos y usurpaciones tenemos denuncias de Misiones, Salta y también en el Sur, por Bariloche… además dentro de un ratito se corta la señal… ¡La lucha es día a día, compañero! No cabe duda, pienso y pensamos los que estamos de este lado de la brecha.

The government has never promised that the circuit breaker measures will definitely end on May 4. When LHL made the announcement a week ago, the exact words he used were ""

this circuit breaker will apply for one month, **in the first instance**.""

Ie. We will try this out for one month first. Which also implies that if the situation doesn't improve, the measures will be extended or even more stringent measures will be implemented.

If you have been paying attention to what the government has been saying, you would know that they don't expect the outbreak to end anytime soon.

A coronavirus vaccine could be available for the general public by September, a University of Oxford professor has said.

In an interview with The Times, the professor said that she and her team have already created a potential vaccine that is due to begin human trials within two weeks.

She told the paper she is ""80%"" confident of its success, ""based on other things that we have done with this type of vaccine"".

If the past is any indicator, the world won’t have a coronavirus vaccine for more than a year, probably longer. The mumps vaccine—considered the fastest ever approved—took four years to go from collecting viral samples to licensing a drug in 1967. Clinical trials come with three phases, and the first stages of the current COVID-19 trials aren’t due for completion until this fall, spring 2021, or much later. And there are good reasons to allow time for safety checks. Some preliminary vaccines for the related coronavirus SARS, for instance, actually enhanced the disease in model experiments.

“A year to 18 months would be absolutely unprecedented,” says Peter Hotez, dean at Baylor University’s National School of Tropical Medicine. “Maybe with the new technology, maybe with throwing enough money on it, that'll happen. But we have to be really careful about those time estimates.”"

This should, ideally, be a matter of good data and science. Not politics.

I am, by far, no fan of this President, the Republican Party, the conservative movement, neoliberalism, or capitalism as it is practiced almost universally around the globe in today's economy. You can look through my comment history as a testament to this. I say this because I think a lot of people who haven't been following the news skeptically or paying attention to some of the dissenting voices in academia are going to be in for a shock. This virus may turn out to be less deadly than the flu. Yes, Donald Trump may have been right. Not right in the sense that he knew what he was talking about or had good intentions for others. But, right in the sense that it may actually be just a really bad flu. And much of all this has been fed by bad data, lack of testing, and panic.** 

Don't take my word for it though. I would encourage skeptics to look up recent commentary from [Dr. John Ioannidis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Ioannidis) of Stanford. Or watch these videos:

[
Perspectives on the Pandemic | Dr John Ioannidis of Stanford University | Episode 1 \(1 Hr.\)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6MZy-2fcBw)

[Commentary on the Coronavirus from expert Dr. John Ioannidis \(19 Min.\)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LAa_kHBE234)


This man is known in the medical community for being a data purist of the highest order:

[John Ioannidis: ""Reproducible Research: True or False?"" | Talks at Google \(2014 56 Min.\)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPYzY9I78CI&t=1503s)


**The true infection rate globally and within the U.S. has been a massive unknown due to the lack of testing.** So the true death and hospitalization rate has been wild guesswork. Testing leads to good data. Good data leads to good decisions. And some incredibly bad decisions have been made. Of historic proportions.

From two weeks ago:

[Cuomo says NY needs 30,000 ventilators, pleads with feds for help](https://thehill.com/homenews/state-watch/489214-cuomo-says-ny-needs-30000-ventilators-pleads-with-feds-for-help)

From yesterday:


[
The number of new coronavirus hospital admissions dropped to 200 on Wednesday, the smallest number of new cases since March 18, according to a chart. Cuomo said it was the “lowest number we’ve had since this nightmare started.”](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/04/09/new-york-coronavirus-daily-death-toll-reaches-third-straight-record-at-799-gov-cuomo-says.html) 

F**rom 30,000 potentially needing ventilators to just 200 admitted to the hospital yesterday.** And that's just admitted to the hospital, let alone the need for a ventilator. **That is a massive disparity.** 

I know many here were thinking that when Trump was claiming that we were going to have hundreds of thousands dead that he was still underplaying all this. No, it was the other way around. It's likely to be far, far, less and he's going to declare himself a national hero... 

...and that trillion-dollar bailout bill is probably never going to be repealed. Or get proper oversight.

FYI—I'm not going to field questions surrounding skepticism related to all I've laid out here. I would encourage you to look at Dr. Ioannidis' recent commentary or the videos I posted a link to. Time will bear this out as true or false, and [we will have Sweden to look at in the future](https://www.vox.com/2020/4/9/21213472/coronavirus-sweden-herd-immunity-cases-death) as to whether or not the American approach is the disaster I believe it is."

>The UK has become the first country to embrace the monetary financing of government to fund the immediate cost of fighting coronavirus, with the Bank of England agreeing to a Treasury demand to directly finance the state’s spending needs on a temporary basis. 

>The move allows the government to bypass the bond market until the Covid-19 pandemic subsides, financing unexpected costs such as the job retention scheme where bills will fall due at the end of April. 

>Although BoE governor Andrew Bailey opposed monetary financing earlier this week, Treasury officials felt it was best to have the insurance of the central bank willing to finance its operations in the short term.

>It highlights the extraordinary demands on cash the government has experienced in recent weeks, which it feels it cannot finance immediately in the gilts market.

>In a statement to financial markets on Thursday, the government announced it would extend the size of the government’s bank account at the central bank, known historically as the “Ways and Means Facility”, which normally stands at just £370m.

>This will rise to an effectively unlimited amount, allowing ministers to spend more in the short term without having to tap the gilts market. In 2008, a similar move saw the facility rise briefly to £20bn.

>The scale is likely to be large. The government has already tripled the amount of debt it wanted to raise in financial markets in April from £15bn announced in the March 11 Budget to £45bn by the start of this month. 

>Although the gilts market showed severe stress in the middle of March as the coronavirus crisis deepened, the government has so far had little difficulty raising finance, especially as the BoE had already committed to printing £200bn to pump into the government bond market to ensure there was sufficient demand for gilts and improve market functioning.

>This direct monetary financing of government would be “temporary and short-term”, the Treasury said in its statement.

>“As well as temporarily smoothing government cash flows, the W & M Facility supports market function by minimising the immediate impact of raising additional funding in gilt and sterling money markets,” it added.

>It said any drawings on this facility would be repaid as soon as possible before the end of the year.

>Market reaction was muted. Sterling was trading 0.1 per cent higher against the US dollar at just below $1.24 shortly after the announcement, while the yield on the benchmark 10-year UK gilt was flat at 0.37 per cent. 

>But many economists saw the Treasury’s demand to be financed directly as a big step.

>Tony Yates, senior adviser at Fathom Consulting and a former BoE official, said the move was “an indication of the extraordinary pressures on government”. He added, however, that UK monetary financing of government deficits was unlikely to turn Britain into Zimbabwe because, once the crisis was over, the UK’s capacity to raise taxes again remained intact. 

>But just as the quantitative easing the BoE has introduced since 2009 has never been repaid, Richard Barwell, head of macro research at BNP Asset Management and also a former BoE official, said temporary moves such as this often became more permanent as time passed.

>“Persistent monetary financing feels inevitable. Central banks just need to figure out a plan for how to best get into it and how they might eventually want to get out of it,” he said.

Our sovereign government has gone full Modern Monetary Theory - the only country on the planet to do this. And they're getting away with this because in the land of the blind, the one-eyed man is king. 

If we come out of this with our society intact and economy functioning, inflation low and debt under control because under MMT, the BoE just goes ""delete"", history is going to look on this period with awe."

> The discussion has been killed by these obviously fake news reports and that is a worrying thing. It almost gives even more cause for concern regarding the technology.

This is getting to look a lot like conspiracy theories. They often take the basic form of:

1) Here is circumstantial evidence of X causing Y (e.g. of course America would want to lie about landing on the moon, they were scared of Russia).  
2) The fact you don't know about it *proves* there is a cover-up (the existence of the conspiracy has been assumed without real evidence, and now the argument is moving to how people are being manipulated, appealing to the paranoia and/or powerlessness of the listener).  
3) So now you should be concerned / subsribe to my YouTube channel / buy my health-enhancing vitamin porridge *because they're manipulating how you think*.

A mind that will not entertain alternative theories or potential conspiracies is a closed mind. The sooner we get the demonisation of alternative thought out of the culture the better.

Just to question your points about a 3% mortality. We were initially told by people like the WHO and national governments they believed that the case fatality rate was 1-2%. This then increased to 3.6%. When we look at countries like UK, Spain and Italy you could be forgiven for thinking the CFR is as high as 10%! Its clearly not THAT high.

That being said, the study of the small German town where 14% of the population has antibodies and 2% are infected does indicate that SARS-COV-2 has spread further and wider than assumed. I understand from that study that of those 14% some had no symptoms, some had symptoms but didn't think it was Coronavirus some had the symptoms and did think they had the Coronavirus. We can probably assume that up to 50% of undiagnosed infections might be asymptomatic.

So with a 10% CFR and 50% of cases undetected in the wider community that would drop our CFR to around 5%. Since half of all cases are unknown about. But look at Germany's CFR. Much lower than other European countries. Why? Two reasons. Germany has been conducting the most widespread testing of its population. However, most of Germany's earlier infections were young skiers returning ftom the Alps and Northern Italy.

The German Town would surely suggest the possibility of a CFR of 0.3. But I'm not entirely convinced. This, for context, would make Coronavirus three times more deadly than seasonal flu. Or a third more deadly than a very bad flu year (which we get about a decade or so).

If that's truly the case then yes, this could be viewed as a massive overreaction and economies will have been tanked for all this. 

However, we still don't know what regional variables there are, genetic variables, socio demographic variables, age variables. Even though these are becoming clearer. Further, we also need to know how quickly the virus is mutating. This would be useful data. 

I'm hoping we see a CFR of between 0.5 and 1.0. That will be a good outcome. Not great, but better than we'd thought. Remember, Spanish Flu had a CFR of around 1.0 and tens of millions died. Let's hope SARS-COV-2 is not as bad as that."

There would be issues for *any country* if the global supply grid completely collapses, but food-wise the US would be in better shape to weather such a crises than most other countries in the world. 

This is not to discount your very real point- no doubt countries holding their rice now is an act of caution in the event of a global depression, supply shocks due to the coronavirus, etc. Rice lasts *very well* when properly stored (especially white rice), and is an excellent survival food.

It definitely can have an effect on the US, but I don't think it spells our doom either. Im down for argument here man- fire back with something if you think I'm missing your point or underestimating things..."

In fact it supports that the virus came from China. 

The study discusses mutations in coronavirus which they group into three major groups: A, B and C. A was the first and closest to the bat virus and then infected people in China. Then A spread from china into the US and Australia. B then mutated from A in china. So there was then A and B in China. 

Then for whatever reason B became the dominant strain in China and east asia, and A did not spread as much. The authors think B might be well suited to spread within asia (but not elsewhere) and this is why it became the dominant type there. 

C then evolved from B, and C went on to spread around europe

People are misinterpreting this study to mean that there is some question as to where the virus originated because ""ooh B is the dominant type in china and outside of china is A"" but that is a massive misrepresentation of the results of this study."

CDC is how recommending the use of a mask or face covering, people may be asymptomatic and still able to transmit a virus they may not even know they have.

You are correct that facial hair is an impediment to a proper seal, but still having your mouth covered is way better than no mask at all. Even talking emits respitory droplets, doesn’t just have to be sneezes and coughs.

Gloves to me make sense because you have something on to remind you to not touch your face. You are very correct that you should still be washing your hands regularly, it’s one more level of caution to help keep ourselves and others safe."

Btw, more people travel on the nyc subway on average each day than the population of 30 of our 50 states (average ridership is about the size of the state of Maryland, 5 million people).

Maybe your source is bullshit since they don't claim that. On 6 April China claimed they can't find localized case on that day, but only imported ones, but that doesn't mean localized cases don't exist.

They soon find some on 8 April and onwards.

This is inline with other Asian countries where imported cases are higher than local cases:

Its just not quite dangerous enough to get an oh shit response, but dangerous enough to hurt really bad if it gets out of control. We lower our guard because person to person its not that bad, but its 30 times more lethal and twice as infectious (scaling exponentially) than the flu, which is already a logistical nightmare on our hospitals. When you spread that out it can make huge waves.

Think about it like this. On average the flu infects 28 million people in the US each year. If you let the coronavirus run under the same parameters (keeping in mind that there is a vaccine for the flu) it would likely infect around 200 million people. This is because of the exponential increase you get with the doubled infection rate. With the 28 million the flu infects about 114 thousand need hospitalization. With COVID you would be in the ballpark of 30 million that need hospitalization. Hopefully that puts into perspective the kind of overwhelming of the system we're talking about here. Sure some are asymptomatic (and still spreading), some get sick and some get really sick, the proportions of these outcomes are what will really get us in the end.

This has to last, it really does. We cant cope with having 1.5% of our population die (more like 3-4 with overwhelming of the system). The long term fix is a vaccine, but until then there is no way we can negate substantial economic detriment. Its simply unavoidable. Deciding whether or not we will net gain or net lose from opening the economy is a monumental undertaking and the effort required should be applauded."

In fact there is a strong positive covariance between employment and the stock market. according to both macroeconomic theory and empirical evidence unemployment is found to be countercyclical to output. The reason for the disparity in this meme is twofold. 1) there are frictions with regard to employment which cause a delay in layoffs compared to the reaction of the stock market. 2) a different timeframe is used for the 2 variables which misleads the viewer. If you also used 3 weeks as the period for the stock market you would find that it was about level despite volatility. But if you stepped back a bit further you would see that the stock market is definitely not doing well right now. The valuation process is complex. When you introduce something like coronavirus, you are going to see a lot of fluctuation as investors try to process what is unfolding. There is no secret conspiracy to enrich wealthy people.

Everytown and Brady poured in millions, GVP advocates staffed campaigns, and it was the single biggest issue for Virginians. Don't let the gun rights active and loud minority fool you: this is something VA wanted. 

Let's hope the Deeds, Surovell, Petersen, and Edwards vote for the AWB next year. All of thess Democrats voted to delay it till next year for a lack of ""data"", despite the huge amount of research having been done in the last years. And these guys really aren't in the most competitive seats either. They all had NO Republican challenger last year. 

Chap Petersen in particular is a huge problem. He's from one of the bluest parts of the state, yet he's killed private background checks and paid family leave for part time workers. He was even on Fox and Friends spreading NRA talking points.

* Placed on Calendar Senate (07/22/2019), which is not related to Coronavirus because it is a shell bill;
* Engrossed in House (07/17/2019) shell bill; and

2020-04-11,tennbot,nashville,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/nashville/comments/fz93bc/vanderbilt_if_we_quit_social_distancing_50000_may/fn3luc8/,"**[Vanderbilt: If Tennessee gives up on social distancing, 50K could be hospitalized](http://outline.com/https://www.tennessean.com/story/news/health/2020/04/10/vanderbilt-coronavirus-modeling-social-distancing-hospitalization-estimates/5127909002/)**

If Tennesseans abandon the social distancing efforts that succeeded at slowing the 

, more than one out of every 10 state residents couldbeinfected and 50,000 people may be hospitalized in May, Vanderbilt researchers said Friday.

These predictions come from an unlikely scenario where social distancing is reversed despite the advocacyof public health experts and local and state leaders. But the research illustrates the harrowing potential for the virus to spread if residents ignore instructions to minimize exposure.

Even a few people could inflamethe outbreak, like embers igniting a wildfire, researchers said. And Tennessee has so much to lose.

Our model saysthe over 4,000 cases we have in the state of Tennessee right now could have been sparked by as a few as 10 patients six weeks ago,"" Melinda Buntin, a Vanderbilt health policy professor, said Friday.""So it doesn't take many of those 4,000 cases out there going to Easter Sunday services and the like to spark a huge resurgence in cases across the state of Tennessee.""

These predictions come from

, which studied the virus in an effort to forecast the spread in the coming weeks and months. The modeling is largely based on transmission rates, which is a measurement of far each person spreads the virus.

As of mid-March, every Tennessean with the virus was believed to infect five others, researchers said.Social distancing has since reduced this rate to about 1.4. To fully suppress the outbreak, this rate must drop below 1 and stay there.

Based on the fluctuation of this transmission rate, researchers have forecast three scenarios for the outbreak:

 In this scenario, Tennessee keeps current social distancing strategies in place and the transmission rate of the virus remains where it is today. It is predicted the virus would 

, which would stretch but not shatter the capacity of hospitals.

 Improvements to social distancing lowers the transmission rate below 1, which means the virus peaks in mid-May with only 2,000 to 3,000 hospitalizations. Hospitals should be more than capable to handle the patient load.

 If Tennessee were to abandon social distancing now, the transmission rate of the virus may rise back to where it began. Each infected person would infect as many as five others, and as much as 13% of the population would be infected. By mid-May, 50,000 people would be hospitalized.

Lack of testing, underreported deaths

None of thescenarios presented on Friday estimatehow many Tennesseans will die.

Vanderbilt officials saidfatalitiesare particularly difficult to predict, at least in part because the 

 due to limitson the availability of coronavirus testing.

John Graves, a Vanderbilt professor at the core of the modeling effort,said Thursdaya lack of testinghampered efforts to forecast the virus also.

Our model has to assume that only a fraction of people who are infected havebeen tested, Graves said. And weve seen some delays and stalls in testing over the last month or so. So, I think, we are definitely not at the place right now where we have the widespread testing necessary to relax social distancing.

Gov. Bill Lee and state officials often tout Tennessee as a nationwide leader on coronavirus testing. Tennessee has the 

 second in the south behind Louisiana according to data fromThe COVID Tracking Project.

Lee said Thursday he was not aware of any testing facilityturning away people who had been recommended for a coronavirus by a medical professional.

""We are trying to get ourselves in a position where folks are not turned away and, in fact, developing strategies to ramp up testing significantly all across the state, Lee said. ""We have a strong commitment to it.

As of Friday afternoon, nearly 

, detecting 

according to the Tennessee Department of Health.

At least 98 people have died.

Confusion on coronavirus projections

The governorhas said this Vanderbilt modeling will be a guide as his administration works to combat the outbreak in the coming weeks and months. However, on Thursday, a key member of Lees cabinet appeared to misinterpret the modeling.

When asked about some predictions in the model  

  Health Commissioner Lisa Piercey dismissed this scenario as unlikely.

It is our understanding, and this is subject to change based on further conversation, but its our understanding that the model that projects a big surge in June is contingent upon complete reversal of the current social distancing practices, Piercey said. I dont believe anybody expects that to happen.

Piercey was wrong. In actuality, the Vanderbilt model predicts a June peak and 5,000 hospitalizations if Tennessee continues on its current course, which Vanderbilt describes as a ""status quo"" scenario.

Gillum Ferguson, a spokesman for the governor, said Friday the Lee administration had multiple follow-up conversations with Vanderbilt to clarifysome aspects of the Vanderbilt modeling.

We're looking at a number of models, not just Vanderbilt's, but ultimately, a model is just that  one of many tools in our toolbox  so excessive weighting of statements in the model itself or by individuals should be avoided, Ferguson said.

Roughly eight-in-ten (79%) of those whose main source is Fox News say the media slightly or greatly exaggerated the risk of the pandemic, with only 15% saying they got the risks about right.

Meanwhile, the MSNBC consumers are the least likely to say that the media exaggerated the risks (35%), while 58% of them believe they got the risk about right. Among those who name CNN, 54% say that the media slightly or greatly exaggerated the risks, a percentage that puts them almost equidistant between the Fox News and MSNBC audiences. And 40% in the CNN group say the media got the risk about right. 


In addition, two-thirds (66%) of those who rely on MSNBC correctly answered that the coronavirus originated in nature, rather than in a laboratory. That compares with the 37% of the Fox News group who give that same answer, a response that was virtually tied with several other groups for the lowest percentage of correct answers.

Here, the CNN audience is in the middle of the MSNBC and Fox audience responses, with 52% responding that the virus occurred naturally.

In addition, 39% in the Fox News group say the virus originated – either intentionally or unintentionally – in a laboratory, compared with 23% of the CNN group and 14% of the MSNBC group that say the same thing."

I'm 33, I was in the military, I've been to more shitholes in the world than I realized were in the world 10 years ago and seen what people can endure and survive. My problems, in the grand scheme of things, are pretty fucking small potatoes.

Got some credit card debt? There's a way out of it, even its if just declare bankruptcy and move on.

This coronavirus thing? Guys with more letter after their name than I have in my name are working their asses off to kill it. Have faith in them, have faith in science. Do your part and we'll get through this.

We've survived every ""major catastrophe"" that has come at me so far, this one will be no different if we don't panic and keep on keeping on, and do your part, even if your part is just sit your ass at home and binge Netflix.

Of course, my views may be coloured by all the reading I've been doing lately of people trying to run off for Easter long weekend. I mean, seriously people? Nothings fucking open, where you gonna go? You ain't working, every weekend is a long weekend, one giant, continuous long weekend."

I live basically next door to Alliances, and I hear LGS’s all over the country complain about almost no retail exclusives prior to this for a few years. One of the complaints from Wizards was LGS’s gouging. Some stores taking promos meant for free and selling them, stuff like that. The other LGS’s trying to do it “the right way” were always upset and complaining with those that didn’t because it put them at a disadvantage. Doing this gouging thing when the price was set for stores to make money at 165.00 is bad for everyone. Ultimately it’s Wizards fault for not producing more after making them available in the first place."

1. White supremacy. From kids we are taught that white= power. The presidents all white. The teachers/principals white. Officers, scientists white. Subconsciously as a kid, I felt I was inferior for a long time because of these reasons. That mentality is hard to break for a lot of people. Asians are another minority group, that has been painted in our minds as the cause of a very immediate pain which is the coronavirus. People want someone to blame as to why they can’t go different places. Unfortunately the lowest common denominator will associate Asia with china and China with covid. But slavery? Jim Crowe? Redlining? First it’s easier for us to ignore that because that “happened to someone else, not me” second, a lot want to forget to not be seen as “blaming white people for everything” which is asinine."

This is not as big of an issue as it may seem, people are more forgiving of job hopping early in one's career. In fact it can be a positive thing as it demonstrates self-direction and assertiveness, because chances are most people do not find the right fit immediately and so they should be moving around to find it; if one does not move around early in their career to find the right fit and is clearly not in the right fit, then it shows the opposite--laziness, timidness, etc.

>I've heard many people say that contractors are treated like second class citizens.

This unfortunately can be very true, however it is highly dependent on the workplace's culture. You may be able to get a sense on review websites like Glassdoor. If you are young and can tough it out, it may still be worth the risk though. Also, negative experiences can counterintuitively be good for you, because they are learning experiences and can make you stronger.

>Given that I wont be an official employee, I don't know if I can even use the experience & references going forward. 

If you do a good job and stay professional in your relationships, it may increase the number of your references because you are simply interacting with more people by changing jobs.

>To be fair having 1-6 months experience may not be looked upon favourably

You would be able to use the 1-6 months of experience generally, although it varies depending on the employer--arguably you might not want to work for someone who does not value it. So early in your career though, every month of experience is valuable, and decent employers will understand that you cannot have 5 years of experience from someone who is only out of college for 2 years. Every month from 0-24 months for such a person only 2 years out is valuable and worth noting.

It comes down to your risk tolerance and whether you can afford the uncertainty of the new role. To me, it actually sounds like the rare situation where the contract position might be better, because you will be earning more money (which proportionally may be a big deal for you early in your career) at a better bank and diversifying your experience. Probably neither place will end up being your long-term career, but the contract gets you an opportunity for an extra look. You should consider that 30 years from now, what are the possible trajectories you will be looking back from at that time from staying in your current job or trying the new opportunity?

Oftentimes, when someone is in their comfort zone, they are stagnating. It takes getting out of your comfort zone to grow, because it puts you in a new environment with new skills, contacts, info, opportunities, etc. The new opportunity is certainly not risk free, but seems +/- positive. Lastly again, B2B versus B2C may be a lot more interesting through this coronavirus situation."

Hanson, who pushed the idea, is not a scientist - he's a historian and a right-wing conspiracy theorist nutjob/liar. 

As for the actual reason why his theory is so wrong, here are some number:

>How can we be sure that coronavirus did not sweep the Bay area last fall? Well, to begin with, how large was the fleet of refrigerated trucks standing by at Bay area hospitals last fall to receive the bodies from overrun morgues? Because those trucks are there in New York, and Detroit, and in other cities where COVID-19 has become widespread. Did California authorities have to dig graves on Alcatraz like those currently being dug on Hart Island in New York? >Surely they did. Because that’s what an outbreak of COVID-19 looks like.

>In fact, that’s what an outbreak of COVID-19 looks like when authorities are fighting it with every social distancing measure at their disposal. America had a two month preview of the virus, including seeing outbreaks in China, South Korea, and Italy, before more than a small number of cases were present in the United States. We don’t have to guess about that, because we could watch what an outbreak meant there. We can see what an outbreak has brought here. None of it is what San Francisco looked like in the fall.

>The numbers around COVID-19 have been all too consistent and unrelenting. About half of all cases are either asymptomatic or so mild that they might be overlooked. About 30% of cases generate more severe, flu-like symptoms, but recover without necessarily needing hospitalization. About 20% of cases bring on severe difficulty in breathing and other symptoms that demand medical attention. Of these, about half—10% of all cases—need critical care, including oxygen, respirators, or ventilators. About 3.5% die. The case fatality rate in New York as of Saturday morning is 4.6%. In the United States overall, it stands at 3.7%.

>For California to achieve herd immunity in a completely novel virus where no one has immunity going in, would require something on the order of 70% of people to become infected. That’s 28 million infections. 5.6 million people needing hospitalization. About 1 million dead. That did not happen without being noticed. 

>As long as we’re indulging theories that keep being put forward, let’s engage another and say that that there are masses more asymptomatic people out there than are being caught by inadequate testing. We know this isn’t true from data in South Korea, Singapore, and elsewhere … but let’s say it anyway. Let’s say the “real” case fatality rate for COVID-19 is ten times less than what’s currently being seen in the United States.

>In that case, California would have only experienced around 100,000 deaths from flu last fall. Or about three times what the whole nation experienced in flu deaths for the entire flu season. This did not happen. Nothing even close to it happened. In fact, despite Hanson pointing to reports of an “early flu season,” flu deaths were not even up for California during the fall.

>Finally, there is one other rather large issue with this I-really-hate-to-use-the-term “theory.” Hanson claims that San Francisco has direct connections to Wuhan that could have brought the virus there months ahead of time. But what else has direct connections to San Francisco? Everything. Had the virus become established in the Bay area and spread beyond a handful of cases, it wouldn’t have resulted in a neat little mini-epidemic nicely prescribed by political boundaries that make Democratic leaders at the local and state level look good. It would have done just what it did in February. it would have become a global pandemic."

Care act regarding for 401k Loan: 

(1) INCREASE IN LIMIT ON LOANS NOT TREATED AS DISTRIBUTIONS.—In the case of any loan from a qualified employer plan (as defined under section 72(p)(4) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) to a qualified individual made during the 180-day period beginning on the date of the enactment of this Act—

(A) clause (i) of section 72(p)(2)(A) of such Code shall be applied by substituting “$100,000” for “$50,000”, and

(B) clause (ii) of such section shall be applied by substituting “the present value of the nonforfeitable accrued benefit of the employee under the plan” for “one-half of the present value of the nonforfeitable accrued benefit of the employee under the plan”.

Care Act Related to Distribution: 

(A) CORONAVIRUS-RELATED DISTRIBUTION.—Except as provided in paragraph (2), the term “coronavirus-related distribution” means any distribution from an eligible retirement plan made—

(i) on or after the date of the enactment of this Act and before December 31, 2020,

(ii) to an individual—

(I) who is diagnosed with the virus SARS-CoV-2 or with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) by a test approved by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention,

(II) whose spouse or dependent (as defined in section 152 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) is diagnosed with such virus or disease by such a test, or

(III) who experiences adverse financial consequences as a result of being quarantined, being furloughed or laid off or having work hours reduced due to such virus or disease, being unable to work due to lack of child care due to such virus or disease, closing or reducing hours of a business owned or operated by the individual due to such virus or disease, or other factors as determined by the Secretary of the Treasury (or the Secretary's delegate).

(B) ELIGIBLE RETIREMENT PLAN.—The term “eligible retirement plan” has the meaning given such term by section 402(c)(8)(B) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986.

(5) INCOME INCLUSION SPREAD OVER 3-YEAR PERIOD.—

(A) IN GENERAL.—In the case of any coronavirus-related distribution, unless the taxpayer elects not to have this paragraph apply for any taxable year, any amount required to be included in gross income for such taxable year shall be so included ratably over the 3-taxable-year period beginning with such taxable year.

(B) SPECIAL RULE.—For purposes of subparagraph (A), rules similar to the rules of subparagraph (E) of section 408A(d)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 shall apply.


=====================
401k Loan: 

My understanding from reading the bill above, Congress increased the limit for 401k loan from 50k to 100k under clause (i).

Under clause (ii), instead of half of my balance, I can withdraw 100% of my balance. 


401k distribution:

I don't understand this. Does this mean that if I withdraw 10k and payback 1/3 each year for the next three years, I don't have to pay taxes on the withdraw?

Let's say if I withdraw 10k and don't pay anything back"

###Tips For Social Distancing, Quarantine, And Isolation During An Infectious Disease Outbreak

**What Is Social Distancing?**

Social distancing is a way to keep people from interacting closely or frequently enough to spread an infectious disease. Schools and other gathering places such as movie theaters may close, and sports events and religious services may be cancelled.

**What Is Quarantine?**

Quarantine separates and restricts the movement of people who have been exposed to a contagious disease to see if they become sick. It lasts long enough to ensure the person has not contracted an infectious disease.

**What Is Isolation?**

Isolation prevents the spread of an infectious disease by separating people who are sick from those who are not. It lasts as long as the disease is contagious.

##What To Expect: Typical Reactions

Everyone reacts differently to stressful situations such as an infectious disease outbreak that requires social distancing, quarantine, or isolation. People may feel:

- **Anxiety, worry, or fear related to**:  
- Your own health status  
- The health status of others whom you may have exposed to the disease  
- The resentment that your friends and family may feel if they need to go into quarantine as a result of contact with you  
- The experience of monitoring yourself, or being monitored by others for signs and symptoms of the disease  
- Time taken off from work and the potential loss of income and job security  
- The challenges of securing things you need, such as groceries and personal care items  
- **Concern** about being able to effectively care for children or others in your care  
- **Uncertainty or frustration** about how long you will need to remain in this situation, and uncertainty about the future  
- **Loneliness** associated with feeling cut off from the world and from loved ones  
- **Anger** if you think you were exposed to the disease because of others’ negligence  
- **Boredom and frustration** because you may not be able to work or engage in regular day-to-day activities  
- **Uncertainty or ambivalence** about the situation  
- **A desire** to use alcohol or drugs to cope  
- **Symptoms of depression**, such as feelings of hopelessness, changes in appetite, or sleeping too little or too much  
- **Symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD)**, such as intrusive distressing memories, flashbacks (reliving the event), nightmares, changes in thoughts and mood, and being easily startled.

##Ways To Support Yourself During Social Distancing, Quarantine, and Isolation

#UNDERSTAND THE RISK

Consider the real risk of harm to yourself and others around you. The public perception of risk during a situation such as an infectious disease outbreak is often inaccurate. Media coverage may create the impression that people are in immediate danger when really the risk for infection may be very low. Take steps to get the facts:

- Stay up to date on what is happening, while limiting your media exposure. Avoid watching or listening to news reports 24/7 since this tends to increase anxiety and worry. Remember that children are especially affected by what they hear and see on television.  
- Look to credible sources for information on the infectious disease outbreak.

#BE YOUR OWN ADVOCATE

Speaking out about your needs is particularly important if you are in quarantine, since you may not be in a hospital or other facility where your basic needs are met. Ensure you have what you need to feel safe, secure, and comfortable.

- Work with local, state, or national health officials to find out how you can arrange for groceries and toiletries to be delivered to your home as needed.  
- Inform health care providers or health authorities of any needed medications and work with them to ensure that you continue to receive those medications.

#EDUCATE YOURSELF

Health care providers and health authorities should provide information on the disease, its diagnosis, and treatment.

- Do not be afraid to ask questions—clear communication with a health care provider may help reduce any distress associated with social distancing, quarantine, or isolation.  
- Ask for written information when available.  
- Ask a family member or friend to obtain information in the event that you are unable to secure this information on your own.

#WORK WITH YOUR EMPLOYER TO REDUCE FINANCIAL STRESS

If you’re unable to work during this time, you may experience stress related to your job status or financial situation.

- Provide your employer with a clear explanation of why you are away from work.  
- Contact the U.S. Department of Labor tollfree at 1-866-487-2365 about the Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA), which allows U.S. employees up to 12 weeks of unpaid leave for serious medical conditions, or to care for a family member with a serious medical condition.  
- Contact your utility providers, cable and Internet provider, and other companies from whom you get monthly bills to explain your situation and request alternative bill payment arrangements as needed.

#CONNECT WITH OTHERS

Reaching out to people you trust is one of the best ways to reduce anxiety, depression, loneliness, and boredom during social distancing, quarantine, and isolation. You can:

- Use the telephone, email, text messaging, and social media to connect with friends, family, and others.  
- Talk “face to face” with friends and loved ones using Skype or FaceTime.  
- If approved by health authorities and your health care providers, arrange for your friends and loved ones to bring you newspapers, movies, and books.  
- Sign up for emergency alerts via text or email to ensure you get updates as soon as they are available.  
- Call SAMHSA’s free 24-hour Disaster Distress Helpline at 1-800-985-5990, if you feel lonely or need support.  
- Use the Internet, radio, and television to keep up with local, national, and world events.  
- If you need to connect with someone because of an ongoing alcohol or drug problem, consider calling your local Alcoholics Anonymous or Narcotics Anonymous offices.

#TALK TO YOUR DOCTOR

If you are in a medical facility, you may have access to health care providers who can answer your questions. However, if you are quarantined at home, and you’re worried about physical symptoms you or your loved ones may be experiencing, call your doctor or other health care provider:

- Ask your provider whether it would be possible to schedule remote appointments via Skype or FaceTime for mental health, substance use, or physical health needs.

#USE PRACTICAL WAYS TO COPE AND RELAX

- Relax your body often by doing things that work for you-take deep breaths, stretch, meditate or pray, or engage in activities you enjoy.  
- Pace yourself between stressful activities, and do something fun after a hard task.  
- Talk about your experiences and feelings to loved ones and friends, if you find it helpful.  
- Maintain a sense of hope and positive thinking; consider keeping a journal where you write down things you are grateful for or that are going well

We were slow to adapt, SAGE didn't even consider lockdown or testing, WHO pandemic experts were just ignored, clinical data didn't seem to be considered in a timely fashion, and until mid March we were still following an old flu pandemic plan that basically stated that the government bunker down while the disease spreads throughout the nation.

On Thursday, this “Florida Man” spouted that the coronavirus hasn’t killed anyone under 25 while making an argument for reopening schools in his state.

“This particular pandemic is one where, I don’t think nationwide there’s been a single fatality under 25. For whatever reason, it just doesn’t seem to threaten, you know, kids,” DeSantis said at an educators’ meeting to discuss distance learning, CNN reports.

“And we lose in Florida between five and 10 kids a year for the flu. This one, for whatever reason, much more dangerous if you’re 65 and plus than the flu, no doubt about that, if you’re younger, it just hasn’t had an impact. So that should factor into how we’re viewing this.”

“I think the data on that has been 100% consistent,” he continued. “I’ve not seen any deviation on that.”

Let me just call up my friend BB to see if he can handle Florida because I can’t.
Apparently, DeSantis hasn’t heard of this thing called the internet, and it’s not his fault; as a property of America, Florida, much like Puerto Rico, hasn’t received the funding…

Managing Editor Genetta Adams: Stephen, Florida is a state.

Me: Huh?

Adams: It’s a full-fledged state

Me: ¡Viva la Florida!

Had the governor of the “state” of Florida checked the CDC website, he would’ve learned that four people between the ages of 15 and 24 have died and “one person between the ages of one and four have died. CNN has also reported on the death of a newborn in Connecticut on April 1 and an infant in Illinois last month whose death is being investigated as possibly caused by the virus.”

While the death toll for people under 24 isn’t staggering, the governor might want to remember that young people can carry the virus and infect older people and anyone with underlying conditions, aka the most vulnerable groups.

CNN has reached out to the governor’s office, but hasn’t heard back yet because trying to connect with Florida is difficult considering it’s an island far off the coast…"

And the first intel reports I saw were in January.”

All public officials are saying that the rumor is false and there were no such reports in November and early December, the information only started to appear in the last few days of the year, which matches the official timeline.

>  I'd say that's way better than the way our previous president handled H1N1. 

Give me a break. I couldn't give a fuck about Obama and the bad flu year in 2009.

Also, there was no ""handling"" H1N1. It's just another normal flu strain, and has been endemic for over a decade now. It was only a problem in 2009 because there was no vaccine yet for that strain, and no portion of the population yet immune. There were antivirals for it, and very few Americans died (around 12,000, despite >60 million being infected) 

* H1N1 had/has a 0.02% fatality rate. [(source)](https://www.verywellhealth.com/what-is-h1n1-swine-flu-770496) , [(source)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2009_swine_flu_pandemic_in_the_United_States)
* 2019-nCov has a \~4% fatality rate (even with treatment), hospitalizes an incredible number of people, and is even more contagious. [(source)](https://news.google.com/covid19/map) , [(source)](https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/)

So we've already rocketed past the H1N1 deaths, despite only 1/100th the cases so far.

They are not comparable at all. Quit talking out of your ass and making shit up about Obama to defend Trump."

7. Claims to have never seen a memo from Peter Navarro on January 29th which stated: “The risk of a worst-case pandemic scenario should not be overlooked.”

These actions resulted in a failure to prepare for & mitigate the pandemic via a:
1. Failure to begin stockpiling tests, PPE & ventilators in November instead of March

2020-04-11,Codimus123,ukpolitics,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/ukpolitics/comments/fzhnex/can_keir_starmer_win_a_majority_for_labour/fn489oc/,"Keir Starmer’s starting position as Labour leader is not hopeless, as many think. There is a viable strategy for him to win the next election. But he doesn’t yet have a strong enough appeal to the critical voting segment he needs to win over, and unless he can establish a strong leadership rating among them within the next few months, he will be doomed.
Labour is 124 seats short of a majority, so the voters it needs to win are those that live in the 124 seats Labour is closest to winning in. Within these, the key target voters are those who were open to voting Labour in 2019, but ultimately did not [1].
This group decides whether parties gain majorities. In 2019, the Conservatives gained 44% of voters in their 100 most marginal seats who were open to voting Conservative in 2017 but did not, enough to close a 10–15% gap in these seats. In contrast, Labour gained just 12% of equivalent “Labour considerers” in their 100 most marginal seats.
If Labour wins the 2019 version of this “target Labour considerers” group it will almost certainly be in government. They account for about a fifth of voters in these target seats, while Labour is 20.8% behind in Croydon South, the last seat it needs to win for a majority. Swinging a voter from the winning party reduces their vote share as well raising Labour’s, so swinging most of this group would be enough to win every one of these target seats.
But these voters are harsh judges. Close to three-quarters of target Labour considerers voted Labour at least once since 2005, and over half did so in 2015 or 2017 alone. But in 2019, 51% voted Conservative, 19% Lib Dem, 11% SNP, 7% Green. Labour cannot sit still if it wants to win.
It also cannot win a majority by winning one extra demographic slice.
Target Labour considerers have no single dominant demographic and look like Britain as a whole. Their age, education, gender, ethnicity, and tenure mirror the population, and they voted 55% leave, 45% remain. Slightly more of this group identify as working class than the population overall at 47% compared to 38%, but this is still less than the number identifying as middle class or no class at all, as in Britain overall.
The lesson is simple. Narrow appeals to specific social groups like the working class, non-degree holders, or town-dwellers will fail. To win, Labour must gain support across demographic divisions.
The key to doing this is competent leadership.
Perceptions of Jeremy Corbyn were critical in pushing target Labour considerers to ultimately not vote Labour. There was nearly a perfect relationship between liking Corbyn and voting Labour among those who were open to voting Labour in its 124 target seats. Leadership variables dominate every other factor, including Brexit.

If Keir Starmer cannot convince these key voters that he is the best choice for Prime Minister, he will never get close to Downing Street.
His ratings so far are not enough[2]. Target Labour considerers rate him exactly neutral on a like/dislike scale, an improvement on Corbyn in 2019, but no new dawn. Indeed, this rating is almost identical to Corbyn’s rating among this group in 2017, putting Labour nowhere near a majority.
Starmer’s first steps will be crucial. 57% of target Labour considerers are yet to make up their mind about him. Ipsos MORI’s polling archive of oppositions leaders since Michael Foot suggests that first impressions are crucial. Every opposition leader who failed to become Prime Minister had a negative rating after their first year. In contrast, Tony Blair was at +27 with 51% approval 24% disapproval and became the only opposition leader to win a majority. Cameron was second best after his first year with a negative rating of -5, but received a second wind after 2008 that pushed him into the positives before 2010.
The bottom line is that Starmer cannot afford to fall flat with the public in the months ahead.
One weakness Starmer has is that his support is lower among voters who hold more culturally conservative views. But that does not mean that the right strategy is to toughen Labour’s stance on social issues.
When voters are placed on a liberal-authoritarian scale, target Labour considerers are on average slightly culturally conservative, while Labour is rated as slightly liberal[3].

But when we control for leadership ratings and policy competence, culturally conservative Labour considerers in target seats are not more likely to have voted Labour than those with liberal views, while perceptions of policy competence still make a significant difference.
This makes sense because most swing voters do not have a consistent cultural ideology. Just 22% of target Labour considerers are consistently liberal or conservative on the 5 social issues asked by the British Election Study.
It is policy competence not policy position that matters most to them.
This is even the case on Brexit. The key dividing line between Labour considerers in target seats who voted Labour and those that did not was not between Leave and Remain, but between those who thought a potential Labour government would handle Brexit well or badly. 77% of those who did not vote Labour said it would handle Brexit badly and just 8% said it would handle Brexit well, compared to 34% of those who did vote Labour saying it would handle Brexit well and 36% badly.
A better approach would be to move the political fight back onto economic issues and de-emphasise the culture war. This would be effective since target Labour considerers are significantly closer to Labour than the Conservatives on the left-right economic spectrum.

This is likely to happen no matter what Labour does due to the enormous disruption caused by coronavirus.
But Labour has a severe weakness on economic policy that Starmer must address.
Target Labour considerers simply do not trust Labour with the public purse. 58% said that they thought that if there was a Labour government the economy would get worse, and only 15% said it would get better. Economic credibility is roughly two-thirds as important as leadership ratings in explaining why these swing voters did not vote Labour in 2019, even when Brexit dominated.
The source of this problem is once again competence. According to Sir John Curtice’s analysis of Labour’s economic policies, “where Labour struggled was in persuading voters that the party had the ability to deliver, including in respect of policies that were widely popular. It is also on perceptions of competence — and not for the most part the party’s policy positions on business and industry — that the party was most likely to be found wanting by voters in those groups in which the party performed especially badly.”
So how does Starmer convince target voters that he is a credible Prime Minister and that Labour can deliver on its promises in the midst of an all-consuming crisis?
One Labour leader did it before. After a decade of Labour wilderness, in 1945 it was Clement Attlee not Winston Churchill who the public chose to lead the nation’s reconstruction. The reasons why are instructive: Mass Observation’s 1945 polling report notes that the key words voters used when picking their preferred Prime Minister were “Sensible”, “Straightforward”, “Reasonable”, “Constructive”, and “Grown-up”. It concludes that “After six years of emotion, of glory, of tragedy, of heights and depths of feeling, one gets the impression that people were weary of being roused by any kind of political emotion… Thundering oratory and brilliant repartee were alike out of place; the audience wanted simple common sense and nothing else.”
If Starmer follows Attlee and becomes the no-nonsense, competent, constructive leader, he may well be the next Labour Prime Minister.
[1] The British Election Study asked respondents how likely they were to vote Labour from 0 to 11, so a reasonable measure of a voter open to voting Labour is everyone who responded 4 or above. This turns out to be roughly 55% of the electorate, which seems like a reasonable upper ceiling since it matches Labour’s highest ever polling ratings in the late 1990s.
[2] Note that this is data from the BES Wave 19 that was collected at the end of Dec 2019, but Starmer’s ratings in Ipsos MORI’s polling of Labour leadership candidates have remained fairly constant since so these figures are unlikely to have changed a great deal since this fieldwork.
[3] Labour’s position is taken from the average position of experts in the British Election Study Expert Survey. This average expert rating very closely matches voters’ rating of Labour on a 10 point left-right scale so this appears to be a valid measure of how voters themselves see the parties."

But to do this properly requires remembering that on Earth 2, they have not seen what life is like here. So how would things have played out?*  


*Here is my guess, in the form of what my Washington Post colleagues who are professional reporters might have reported as their story for today:*  


*Capitol Hill was the scene of fiery confrontations between Republicans and Clinton administration officials about the controversial actions taken to combat the covid-19 infection. Republicans argued that the Clinton administration was overzealous in containing the threat, while Democrats argued in favor of measures now being litigated in the Supreme Court.*  


*Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) told reporters that President Clinton had been ""hysterical"" to urge governors to quarantine the cities of Seattle, San Francisco and New Rochelle, N.Y. As the national number of new infections dropped to less than 100 yesterday, McConnell said: ""The federal government has trampled on the liberty of Americans in the name of an overhyped threat. President Clinton is not thinking about this rationally.""*  


*At the same time, Republicans also criticized the Clinton administration for not taking a more hawkish approach toward China, where the coronavirus outbreak originated. Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-Ala.), chairman of the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, blasted Clinton's refusal to sanction China over a lack of transparency. He also urged the House to launch a third round of impeachment hearings. ""The president is blind to how China will weaponize MS-13 gangs to infect our Southern states,"" Sessions said.*  


*In the House, GOP negotiators continued their seventh straight day of negotiations with the Clinton administration over a planned $50 billion emergency fund for the affected cities. Rep. Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) continued to insist to Vice President Tim Kaine that any aid package had to be revenue-neutral, arguing that Medicaid benefits would need to be trimmed to compensate small businesses in the affected areas. He also urged Kaine to zero out emission standards for U.S.-based airlines, which have suffered tremendously from the reduction in international travel.*  


*McCarthy also railed against Fed Chair Janet L. Yellen's emergency swap lines to Europe, saying, ""I don't see why we should be debasing our currency to aid European socialism.""*  


*Compared with other developed countries, the United States has done relatively well in flattening the infection rate. Nonetheless, coronavirus czar Ron Klain's intrusions into interstate commerce have raised concerns. A lawsuit pending before the Supreme Court will determine whether Clinton had the authority to restrict domestic flights and car traffic on the western seaboard.*  


*House Speaker Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.) demurred on whether he would support a third impeachment effort, suggesting that the 2020 rematch with Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump would supersede any impeachment effort. ""With a tanking economy and completely inappropriate federal intrusions into state-level areas of governance, I am certain that voters will reject the president's heavy hand of the state come November.""*  


*Allegations that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention mishandled initial coronavirus testing protocols continue to plague the administration, as have accusations that Clinton browbeat the Food and Drug Administration into approving testing kits using regulatory standards lower than standard FDA protocols.*  


*Trump, who has essentially been campaigning since his surprisingly narrow loss in 2016, told his allies in Congress to demand an inspector general report from the Department of Health and Human Services for mistakes made in containing the spread of the coronavirus: ""THE CDC WAS BAD AT EBOLA AND A DISASTER AT CORONAVIRUS!! WE NEED TO HEAR FROM THE IG!!!"" he tweeted.*  


*Trump also mocked a public service announcement by former presidents Barack Obama and George W. Bush advocating that those in the affected quarantine zones wear masks when they go outside. ""Look at Tweedledum and Tweedledee what a joke! None of this would have happened in a Trump administration. Sad!""*  


*The latest ABC News/Washington Post poll of battleground states continues to show Trump ahead of Clinton by five points across the Midwest.*  


*Testifying in front of the Senate, Defense Secretary Michele Flournoy dismissed calls to militarize the nation' southern border and defended sending the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers into Mexico to help erect quarantine facilities there, saying that all precautions had been taken. Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.), widely rumored to be Tump's preferred vice presidential pick, thundered: ""The greatest military in the world was not designed to help the sick and feed the poor."" He further decried Clinton's offer of assistance to Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro, arguing that the sanctions were just about to cause the regime there to topple.*  


*Meanwhile, both Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte and Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez expressed their appreciation to Clinton during a remote Group of 20 meeting. They thanked her for medical equipment shipments to the regions hit hardest by the pandemic.*  


*Earth 2 would be many times better than Earth 1. But it would not feel that way.*"

In the case of the current coronavirus, there is as yet no preventative vaccine. This is not the case with the social disease. It can be prevented by education.

Why can't an antibiotic kill a virus? What is a placebo-controlled clinical trial? How does herd immunity work? How does one weigh risk vs. benefit in a drug or vaccine?

And more basic concepts. What is the scientific method? What are logical fallacies such as post hoc or straw man or ad hominem and how does one avoid them?

Yes. Trump neglected the pandemic response plan that was left by the Obama administration and Trump put his son-in-law—with no experience in such things—in charge of a coronavirus response team.

Trump was warned about the coming pandemic months in advance and instead of acting on that information, he wrote it off, saying repeatedly that it was nothing to worry about.  

> But ""Trump's fault""? Not the people at Fox that allowed it run?

It's indirect indeed, but it's worth *noticing* that they worship at his alter. If he had been saying that it was a tremendous threat, you better believe that they would have towed the line.

###Tips For Social Distancing, Quarantine, And Isolation During An Infectious Disease Outbreak

**What Is Social Distancing?**

Social distancing is a way to keep people from interacting closely or frequently enough to spread an infectious disease. Schools and other gathering places such as movie theaters may close, and sports events and religious services may be cancelled.

**What Is Quarantine?**

Quarantine separates and restricts the movement of people who have been exposed to a contagious disease to see if they become sick. It lasts long enough to ensure the person has not contracted an infectious disease.

**What Is Isolation?**

Isolation prevents the spread of an infectious disease by separating people who are sick from those who are not. It lasts as long as the disease is contagious.

##What To Expect: Typical Reactions

Everyone reacts differently to stressful situations such as an infectious disease outbreak that requires social distancing, quarantine, or isolation. People may feel:

- **Anxiety, worry, or fear related to**:  
- Your own health status  
- The health status of others whom you may have exposed to the disease  
- The resentment that your friends and family may feel if they need to go into quarantine as a result of contact with you  
- The experience of monitoring yourself, or being monitored by others for signs and symptoms of the disease  
- Time taken off from work and the potential loss of income and job security  
- The challenges of securing things you need, such as groceries and personal care items  
- **Concern** about being able to effectively care for children or others in your care  
- **Uncertainty or frustration** about how long you will need to remain in this situation, and uncertainty about the future  
- **Loneliness** associated with feeling cut off from the world and from loved ones  
- **Anger** if you think you were exposed to the disease because of others’ negligence  
- **Boredom and frustration** because you may not be able to work or engage in regular day-to-day activities  
- **Uncertainty or ambivalence** about the situation  
- **A desire** to use alcohol or drugs to cope  
- **Symptoms of depression**, such as feelings of hopelessness, changes in appetite, or sleeping too little or too much  
- **Symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD)**, such as intrusive distressing memories, flashbacks (reliving the event), nightmares, changes in thoughts and mood, and being easily startled.

##Ways To Support Yourself During Social Distancing, Quarantine, and Isolation

#UNDERSTAND THE RISK

Consider the real risk of harm to yourself and others around you. The public perception of risk during a situation such as an infectious disease outbreak is often inaccurate. Media coverage may create the impression that people are in immediate danger when really the risk for infection may be very low. Take steps to get the facts:

- Stay up to date on what is happening, while limiting your media exposure. Avoid watching or listening to news reports 24/7 since this tends to increase anxiety and worry. Remember that children are especially affected by what they hear and see on television.  
- Look to credible sources for information on the infectious disease outbreak.

#BE YOUR OWN ADVOCATE

Speaking out about your needs is particularly important if you are in quarantine, since you may not be in a hospital or other facility where your basic needs are met. Ensure you have what you need to feel safe, secure, and comfortable.

- Work with local, state, or national health officials to find out how you can arrange for groceries and toiletries to be delivered to your home as needed.  
- Inform health care providers or health authorities of any needed medications and work with them to ensure that you continue to receive those medications.

#EDUCATE YOURSELF

Health care providers and health authorities should provide information on the disease, its diagnosis, and treatment.

- Do not be afraid to ask questions—clear communication with a health care provider may help reduce any distress associated with social distancing, quarantine, or isolation.  
- Ask for written information when available.  
- Ask a family member or friend to obtain information in the event that you are unable to secure this information on your own.

#WORK WITH YOUR EMPLOYER TO REDUCE FINANCIAL STRESS

If you’re unable to work during this time, you may experience stress related to your job status or financial situation.

- Provide your employer with a clear explanation of why you are away from work.  
- Contact the U.S. Department of Labor tollfree at 1-866-487-2365 about the Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA), which allows U.S. employees up to 12 weeks of unpaid leave for serious medical conditions, or to care for a family member with a serious medical condition.  
- Contact your utility providers, cable and Internet provider, and other companies from whom you get monthly bills to explain your situation and request alternative bill payment arrangements as needed.

#CONNECT WITH OTHERS

Reaching out to people you trust is one of the best ways to reduce anxiety, depression, loneliness, and boredom during social distancing, quarantine, and isolation. You can:

- Use the telephone, email, text messaging, and social media to connect with friends, family, and others.  
- Talk “face to face” with friends and loved ones using Skype or FaceTime.  
- If approved by health authorities and your health care providers, arrange for your friends and loved ones to bring you newspapers, movies, and books.  
- Sign up for emergency alerts via text or email to ensure you get updates as soon as they are available.  
- Call SAMHSA’s free 24-hour Disaster Distress Helpline at 1-800-985-5990, if you feel lonely or need support.  
- Use the Internet, radio, and television to keep up with local, national, and world events.  
- If you need to connect with someone because of an ongoing alcohol or drug problem, consider calling your local Alcoholics Anonymous or Narcotics Anonymous offices.

#TALK TO YOUR DOCTOR

If you are in a medical facility, you may have access to health care providers who can answer your questions. However, if you are quarantined at home, and you’re worried about physical symptoms you or your loved ones may be experiencing, call your doctor or other health care provider:

- Ask your provider whether it would be possible to schedule remote appointments via Skype or FaceTime for mental health, substance use, or physical health needs.

#USE PRACTICAL WAYS TO COPE AND RELAX

- Relax your body often by doing things that work for you-take deep breaths, stretch, meditate or pray, or engage in activities you enjoy.  
- Pace yourself between stressful activities, and do something fun after a hard task.  
- Talk about your experiences and feelings to loved ones and friends, if you find it helpful.  
- Maintain a sense of hope and positive thinking; consider keeping a journal where you write down things you are grateful for or that are going well

The answer is they can not.  No where has it ever been said you have to rehire former employees.  Let me say that again:  NO WHERE DOES IT SAY YOU HAVE TO REHIRE FORMER EMPLOYEES.  Look it up.  It just says:

>Forgiveness is based on the employer maintaining or quickly rehiring employees and maintaining salary levels.  Forgiveness will be reduced if full-time headcount declines, or if salaries and wages decrease.

Source: https://www.sba.gov/funding-programs/loans/coronavirus-relief-options/paycheck-protection-program-ppp

Rehiring employees doesn't have to mean former employees.  It can certainly be former if you wish it to but they don't make it a requirement. 

By your logic if you take the PPP loan out and can't rehire your former employees, and then you can't use 75% of the PPP loan?  This is simply incorrect."

It implies it. It explicitly states that they are happening concurrently, not responsively.

Not explicitly, but the implication is that one is being done *because of* the other. We get this from the context of living in a global pandemic, and the nature of the action being taken. 

>""Y is being done because of X"" explicitly states that Y is being done in response to X.

Right, but you can also say Y is being done because of X by saying ""As the Coronavirus death toll increases, NYC has hired contractors to dig more public graves on Hart Island."" There is no practical difference between the two usages. 

>It's not stylistic, the two statement have different meanings.

They mean the exact same thing. The difference between the explicit and the implicit usage is the amount of context you need to know exactly what is being said. If you didn't know there was a pandemic, or, as in the case of many people in this thread, don't believe it's as bad as is being reported, then you might ask, ""Wait, why is this happening?"" But if you're aware that we are in a pandemic and it is deadly, and similar measures have been taken in other countries, or if you live in or around NYC and know what they're going through, then the meaning is clear. But even if you don't, you shouldn't have a problem gleaning what's being said here."

https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/symptoms-testing/index.html

3. On top of that it took until March 20th before we even got to a point to accomplish mass testing. And even then, we aren't expanding to meet the exponential growth of the virus:

First, the growth is not exponential. I don't know what you think mass testing is. We've tested far more than South Korea. Unlike South Korea, the US faced a shortage of PPE. Without that, you wouldn't want people to be tested until that was sorted or your entire health force would be decimated.

2020-04-11,Djamshack,france,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/france/comments/fzflxs/coronavirus_les_services_de_renseignement/fn484qi/,"Coronavirus : les services de renseignement craignent l’embrasement après le confinement

Selon des notes confidentielles que nous avons pu consulter, le service central du renseignement territorial redoute une radicalisation de la contestation sociale à l’issue du confinement.

Ils ont baptisé leur collectif « Refusons le retour à la normale ». Depuis le 4 avril, ces militants de la mouvance contestataire rennaise préparent des actions chocs à coups de slogans et invitations Facebook à des rassemblements… dont l'heure est connue (11 heures) mais pas le jour. Épidémie de coronavirus oblige. « Notre colère ne sera pas confinée. Retrouvons-nous dans la rue dès la fin du confinement! scandent-ils sur les réseaux sociaux. Mettons le pouvoir en quarantaine! »

Voilà le type de messages qu'analysent quotidiennement les policiers des renseignements français depuis la crise sanitaire. Dans des notes confidentielles sur le « suivi de l'impact du Covid-19 en France », les agents du service central du renseignement territorial (SCRT) alertent sur le risque d'embrasement de la contestation sociale à la sortie du confinement. « Le jour d'après est un thème fortement mobilisateur des mouvances contestataires, lit-on dans ces analyses datées du 7, 8 et 9 avril. Le confinement ne permet plus à la gronde populaire de s'exprimer, mais la colère ne faiblit pas et la gestion de crise, très critiquée, nourrit la contestation. »

C'est pourquoi le ministre de l'Intérieur, Christophe Castaner, avait évoqué jeudi « des réseaux d'ultra-droite et d'ultra-gauche très actifs, qui appellent à préparer un certain nombre d'actes », devant la mission parlementaire. Mais sans livrer plus de précisions.

Les notes du SCRT révèlent que des groupuscules de la mouvance autonome — tels « Nantes Révoltée» ou « Rouen dans la rue » — exploitent l'exaspération du monde médical face à la pénurie de masques et de matériel de protection. Et appellent ainsi « à une transversalité des luttes », qui associeraient « gilets jaunes et blouses blanches ».
Des manifestations sont déjà prévues pour le premier samedi post-confinement ou le 21 juin, en hommage à Steve Maia Caniço, ce jeune mort en marge d'une opération de police controversée à Nantes l'an passé. Lors des grèves de novembre contre la réforme des retraites, des rapprochements avaient déjà été observés entre Gilets jaunes radicalisés et cheminots irréductibles.

«Attestation de déplacement révolutionnaire»

Dans l'attente de la sortie du confinement, les agents du renseignement anticipent « la création de comités de lutte entre personnes d'un même immeuble » ainsi « qu'une organisation commune à distance ».

Ils ont constaté la diffusion d'une « attestation de déplacement révolutionnaire » éditée par un média alternatif bordelais se revendiquant des Gilets jaunes. Parmi les cases à cocher de ce document « à utiliser sans modération après le confinement » : « déplacements entre le domicile et le pouvoir indispensables à l'exercice d'émeutes », « participation à des commandos sur demande des assemblées populaires »…

Selon les policiers du renseignement, ces mêmes collectifs d'ultra-gauche s'exaspèrent des modalités du confinement et y voient l'occasion d'afficher « leur hostilité envers les forces de l'ordre ». « La police représente une menace plus grande que le virus lui-même », assène un site militant radical, affirmant que « le confinement est utilisé pour harceler, humilier et parfois tuer ceux identifiés à risques pour le pouvoir : les habitants des zones pauvres. » Quand un autre site voit dans le projet de tracking des malades du Covid-19 « l'efficience de la techno-police » visant à « surveiller les corps et âme de la plèbe ».

L'ultra-droite mobilisée

Cette contestation trouve aussi un écho parmi les sympathisants de l'ultra-droite, dont les identitaires. « L'ultra-droite critique la politique anxiogène qui est menée depuis le début de la crise par des technocrates de l'Etat, visant selon elle à culpabiliser et à manipuler les Français », résument les agents du SCRT. Lesquels ont relevé des écrits appelant ouvertement à la révolte violente.

« La France est une cocotte-minute […] Ce gouvernement macronien a-t-il conscience des sommes de haine et de colère qui s'accumulent ? […] Que les comportements collectifs pourraient se déchaîner contre lui avec toute la brutalité d'une mutinerie sanglante ? » prophétise par exemple un identitaire sur le site du groupuscule la Ligue du Midi. « Toutes les conditions sont réunies pour mettre à bas cette classe politique malfaisante », appuie un militant d'Égalité et réconciliation, estimant que « nous sommes en phrase prérévolutionnaire ».

«Un risque avéré de rapprochement entre ultras radicaux et syndicats»

Un membre des services de renseignement résume : « D'un côté, l'ultra-gauche interprète le confinement comme la mainmise de l'Etat et un supposé totalitarisme. De l'autre, l'ultra-droite nourrit fantasmes et théories du complot sur l'origine de la crise. Nous sommes très vigilants sur les formes que prendra cette contestation à l'issue. » D'un côté comme de l'autre de la mouvance, les sympathisants espèrent que la crise débouchera sur un nouveau modèle de société.

Selon le SCRT, le concept de « jour d'après » séduit aussi les syndicats traditionnels, qui estiment « que la crise démontre les limites du néolibéralisme » où « seule la logique financière prime ». Les victimes économiques de la crise pourraient être tentées de descendre dans la rue.
« Il y a un risque avéré de rapprochement entre ultras radicaux et syndicats dans les secteurs transport et énergie, constate David Le Bars secrétaire général du syndicat des commissaires de la police nationale (SCPN). Des pans entiers de l'économie sont à l'arrêt forcé et d'autres en profitent, comme les grands groupes, ce qui crée encore des raisons au complotisme. »"

Two, we absolutely do not have the highest infection and mortality rates in the world, going on the available data. I mean come on dude, this is real low effort shit. 

Go [here](https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/#countries) and sort by total cases/1M pop, and you'll see that we are outpaced by Ireland, France, Belgium, Italy, Switzerland, Spain, and Iceland. Some of those countries do more tests than us, but some don't.

Use the same data, but sort by deaths/1M pop, and you'll see that we are outpaced by Ireland, Sweden, Switzerland, the UK, the Netherlands, France, Belgium, Italy, and Spain. 

So you're flat out wrong -- the foundation of what you've said is baseless, and therefore, the conclusion that our supposedly worse outcomes can only be boiled down to poor leadership or the stupidity of our population, does not follow.

All that being said, as I mentioned in my original comment, I do think that our leadership has been poor. I think that President Trump was reckless in his rhetoric in ways that encouraged people to be less cautious about social distancing in the early stages of the outbreak. I think that the CDC (especially), FDA and other involved agencies botched their implementation of testing rollouts. I think that the government's slow response to ramp up PPE supply chains was woefully inadequate. These inadequacies caused deaths. And it may be that in the end, our outbreak is worse than other countries because of it. But we don't really know yet.

Perhaps I could even speculate that the individualistic culture of the US has led our populace to adapt more selfish measures than many other places in the world. 

And that's not to mention other factors that may have made us more vulnerable -- for instance, travel volume. But all of that is relatively pointless, because fundamentally, we have little idea how bad our outbreak is in comparison to others yet, and you pretending like you do is highly misleading and detracts from legitimate criticism. 

Finally, the basis of the post, and subsequently my reply, was not a comparison between countries, but a comparison between administrations. In this sense, it is necessary to make a distinction between ""our leaders"", meaning the administration, and ""our leaders"", meaning the administrative state at large. Those two things are obviously intertwined, but they are not the same. Hence, my point, which is that while I believe, Obama's response, for instance, would have been far better, we are talking about a difference in marginal deaths, not total deaths, since the novel coronavirus would not have been contained entirely even with better leadership, which makes comparisons to many of the events in the original graph highly misleading."

""*In the name of the city of Sauerkrautingen and on behalf of its mayor I pronounce quarantine for you in accordance with § 30 of the Protection against Infection Act. You will receive a written legal act via mail soon. Violation of quarantine is a punishable felony.*"" Well, now I know what it means to be on the receiving end of the needle when it comes to public health management of COVID. I've seen it play out for patients many times but now for myself, it still remains astonishing. After I transmitted the list of my recent contact persons (basically only work) to the municipal public health office, I didn't have even the time to finish contacting them by myself. The first ones started messaging me that they had been contacted for questions and testing while I was still copypasting and changing names in the template I used in mails and Whatsapp. Wide range from *""all the best*"" to ""*WHY HAVE YOU BROUGHT ME INTO THIS?*"". I had a total of five received calls within an hour: formal pronouncement of mandated quarantine, instructions for my contact persons,  a physician interrogating me if I was REALLY SURE I had no relevant previous conditions, the hospital's departement of hygiene, the mobile testing unit. *""Which time do I prefer? Well, I'm at home if you are looking for me..""*

A veterinarian of profession, he is mostly praised by scientific circles for his (advisory) handling of the pandemic. Main criticism aspects of his work are concentrated around inconsitent recommendations (community masks, yes or no?) and half-cooked communication (""R is under 1, it's above 1, could be 0.9-1.4"").

One of the most known veterans of coronavirus entities (is that better for a plural?) he had been the first to publish a test for the 2003 SARS virus ([source in English](https://www.nature.com/articles/423114a)) and now he is the head behind the Sars-CoV-2 test employed by the WHO and thus sometimes dubbed ""the German test."" Fully tenured (W3) professorship at the University of Bonn at 35 years, Federal Cross of Merit, full programe. Remarkable h-index between 73 and 88. Hunting down bats is his passion. No wonder, Merkel made him her most important advisor. His calm and captivating voice and an approach of explaining things to laypersons without artificially dumbing them down have made him very popular in Germany with semi-ironic Drosten fan clubs and calls of *Drosten for Chancellor*. The publicity does not suit him and he got exhausted by paparazzi style coverage. Critics of him argue his view is narrowed down on virological aspects and less on epidemological ones.

[**Hendrik Streeck of the University of Bonn**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hendrik_Streeck)**:** The Challenger. Here comes Drosten's successor at the University of Bonn, two years after Drosten left for Berlin (do appointment commitees for professorships take forever everywhere?). Toured the US extensively: HMS, JHU, US Military HIV Research Program, only to come back to Essen in the Ruhr Rust Belt and then quiet Bonn. His primary research focus is HIV but with the pandemic he jumped on the COVID-19 train. The geographical location not far away from the [Heinsberg Cluster](https://www.reddit.com/r/medicine/comments/fxqszt/study_of_heinsberg_cluster_in_germany_suggests/) in the Lower Rhine region was a lucky coincidence. His unfinished prelimary results paper and the shady PR around it brought a lot of [question marks](https://www.reddit.com/r/medicine/comments/fyf0yh/megathread_covid19sarscov2_april_10th_2020/fn0d1gd?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x) around his work and he is now under immense pressure to present a decent final paper and consistent, explainable results.

[**Alexander Kekulé of the University of Halle-Wittenberg**](https://www.mdr.de/nachrichten/podcast/kekule-corona/index.html): The Maverick. Yep, Kekulé as in the guy who dreamed of a snake biting itself and thus figured out the structural form of benzene. That's his grand-grandfather you have to thank or curse for modern organic chemistry. When the pandemic hit Germany, Kekulé was among the first to demand school closures (at least two weeks of ""corona holidays""). Now he is changing rapidly between calling for strict measures and denouncing them. Quote: *""If we keep society for three months or more in lockdown, then we will sacrifice everything what we regard as our identity and culture for the sake of not accepting that some people will die for everyone to be immune. I find that wrong.""* Strong words in a legal system which forbids weighting lifes against lifes (see the unconstitutionality of shooting down hijacked planes).

there is ample precedent to state that such an app (or variants thereof) may become a regular part of our lives and may be used to monitor us in non-emergency scenarios.

once this tool is given to a set of people who have shown that they have no qualms in misusing this power, there is no saying where the slippery slope ends.

If we're equating things and being fair then most things concerning Trump that we can reasonably believe are conspiracy theories due to a lack of hard evidence. If you paid attention to what people were saying and doing during the run-up from about 2015 onward, to the way Clinton did exactly what Sanders did by staying in a race, then it's very clear where the slant leans.

>I’d love it if you could lay it out explicitly rather than just hinting at it vaguely.

You should love following conversations - as if people talk that way. Hard evidence, like I said, are the strategies that both campaigns used in different times, and shots of the media saying ""Can Coronavirus or Bernie Sanders be stopped"", as if they're similar things.

>I am seeing Biden’s win here constantly referred to as a DNC plan but.. how?

The previous candidates who were explicit about what they talked about with Joe Biden, and the fact that *they're* also vague. They're all public figures and many people dropped out after Sanders didn't get enough votes, but kept running until Super Tuesday. That has never really happened before. The fact they don't want to debate, or that Biden isn't speaking as much as any candidate is cause for concern. Because when he does it's like he's perpetually sundowning.

>What is the specific thing I should be blaming them for in general?

Holding elections, postponing debates, media connections, where money comes from, and so on."

###Tips For Social Distancing, Quarantine, And Isolation During An Infectious Disease Outbreak

**What Is Social Distancing?**

Social distancing is a way to keep people from interacting closely or frequently enough to spread an infectious disease. Schools and other gathering places such as movie theaters may close, and sports events and religious services may be cancelled.

**What Is Quarantine?**

Quarantine separates and restricts the movement of people who have been exposed to a contagious disease to see if they become sick. It lasts long enough to ensure the person has not contracted an infectious disease.

**What Is Isolation?**

Isolation prevents the spread of an infectious disease by separating people who are sick from those who are not. It lasts as long as the disease is contagious.

##What To Expect: Typical Reactions

Everyone reacts differently to stressful situations such as an infectious disease outbreak that requires social distancing, quarantine, or isolation. People may feel:

- **Anxiety, worry, or fear related to**:  
- Your own health status  
- The health status of others whom you may have exposed to the disease  
- The resentment that your friends and family may feel if they need to go into quarantine as a result of contact with you  
- The experience of monitoring yourself, or being monitored by others for signs and symptoms of the disease  
- Time taken off from work and the potential loss of income and job security  
- The challenges of securing things you need, such as groceries and personal care items  
- **Concern** about being able to effectively care for children or others in your care  
- **Uncertainty or frustration** about how long you will need to remain in this situation, and uncertainty about the future  
- **Loneliness** associated with feeling cut off from the world and from loved ones  
- **Anger** if you think you were exposed to the disease because of others’ negligence  
- **Boredom and frustration** because you may not be able to work or engage in regular day-to-day activities  
- **Uncertainty or ambivalence** about the situation  
- **A desire** to use alcohol or drugs to cope  
- **Symptoms of depression**, such as feelings of hopelessness, changes in appetite, or sleeping too little or too much  
- **Symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD)**, such as intrusive distressing memories, flashbacks (reliving the event), nightmares, changes in thoughts and mood, and being easily startled.

##Ways To Support Yourself During Social Distancing, Quarantine, and Isolation

#UNDERSTAND THE RISK

Consider the real risk of harm to yourself and others around you. The public perception of risk during a situation such as an infectious disease outbreak is often inaccurate. Media coverage may create the impression that people are in immediate danger when really the risk for infection may be very low. Take steps to get the facts:

- Stay up to date on what is happening, while limiting your media exposure. Avoid watching or listening to news reports 24/7 since this tends to increase anxiety and worry. Remember that children are especially affected by what they hear and see on television.  
- Look to credible sources for information on the infectious disease outbreak.

#BE YOUR OWN ADVOCATE

Speaking out about your needs is particularly important if you are in quarantine, since you may not be in a hospital or other facility where your basic needs are met. Ensure you have what you need to feel safe, secure, and comfortable.

- Work with local, state, or national health officials to find out how you can arrange for groceries and toiletries to be delivered to your home as needed.  
- Inform health care providers or health authorities of any needed medications and work with them to ensure that you continue to receive those medications.

#EDUCATE YOURSELF

Health care providers and health authorities should provide information on the disease, its diagnosis, and treatment.

- Do not be afraid to ask questions—clear communication with a health care provider may help reduce any distress associated with social distancing, quarantine, or isolation.  
- Ask for written information when available.  
- Ask a family member or friend to obtain information in the event that you are unable to secure this information on your own.

#WORK WITH YOUR EMPLOYER TO REDUCE FINANCIAL STRESS

If you’re unable to work during this time, you may experience stress related to your job status or financial situation.

- Provide your employer with a clear explanation of why you are away from work.  
- Contact the U.S. Department of Labor tollfree at 1-866-487-2365 about the Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA), which allows U.S. employees up to 12 weeks of unpaid leave for serious medical conditions, or to care for a family member with a serious medical condition.  
- Contact your utility providers, cable and Internet provider, and other companies from whom you get monthly bills to explain your situation and request alternative bill payment arrangements as needed.

#CONNECT WITH OTHERS

Reaching out to people you trust is one of the best ways to reduce anxiety, depression, loneliness, and boredom during social distancing, quarantine, and isolation. You can:

- Use the telephone, email, text messaging, and social media to connect with friends, family, and others.  
- Talk “face to face” with friends and loved ones using Skype or FaceTime.  
- If approved by health authorities and your health care providers, arrange for your friends and loved ones to bring you newspapers, movies, and books.  
- Sign up for emergency alerts via text or email to ensure you get updates as soon as they are available.  
- Call SAMHSA’s free 24-hour Disaster Distress Helpline at 1-800-985-5990, if you feel lonely or need support.  
- Use the Internet, radio, and television to keep up with local, national, and world events.  
- If you need to connect with someone because of an ongoing alcohol or drug problem, consider calling your local Alcoholics Anonymous or Narcotics Anonymous offices.

#TALK TO YOUR DOCTOR

If you are in a medical facility, you may have access to health care providers who can answer your questions. However, if you are quarantined at home, and you’re worried about physical symptoms you or your loved ones may be experiencing, call your doctor or other health care provider:

- Ask your provider whether it would be possible to schedule remote appointments via Skype or FaceTime for mental health, substance use, or physical health needs.

#USE PRACTICAL WAYS TO COPE AND RELAX

- Relax your body often by doing things that work for you-take deep breaths, stretch, meditate or pray, or engage in activities you enjoy.  
- Pace yourself between stressful activities, and do something fun after a hard task.  
- Talk about your experiences and feelings to loved ones and friends, if you find it helpful.  
- Maintain a sense of hope and positive thinking; consider keeping a journal where you write down things you are grateful for or that are going well

But, it’s the little things. His refusal to do domestic chores, such as cleaning the toilet (even after himself), his grumbling about taking out the garbage, it’s somehow my responsibility to unload the dishwasher every day, not his. 

His insistence in having the tv on at HIGH levels all day and night. Even when he talks in the phone he moves around the house shouting and laughing loudly. His children could be climbing the cabinets and he’s too involved with his video game to care. He brings mail in then scatters it around the house?

2020-04-11,RyanPurdler-Penriff,nrl,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/nrl/comments/fz37n9/nine_attack_was_right_on_the_money_and_the_game/fn4dcs0/,"I wrote that before I read the article , I just read it..

Here’s the copypasta version , I’ve replaced __Nine__ with __Phil Gould__ for my own amusement .. Here’s how I read the article..

The statement made by ~~Nine~~ __myself-Phil Gould__ regarding the NRL this week, clearly approved by chief executive Hugh Marks, was timely and appropriate. I believe it will prove to be hugely significant.

On behalf of ~~Nine~~ __Phil Gould__ , he needed to say it. The NRL needed to hear it. The rest of the media world needed to hear ~~it~~ __my opinion__. Rugby league fans needed to hear ~~it~~ __Phil Gould__, too.

~~It~~ __I__ was blunt, honest and accurate.

Now, before you go saying that I’m employed by Nine and Marks is my boss so naturally I’m going to support his actions, you can stop right there. Anyone who has read my columns over the past 20 years will know I’ve consistently raised the issue of NRL administration squandering hundreds of millions of dollars on flawed philosophies and programs over a long period of time.
__I’m nobodies minion people listen to me and take my advice__

My opinions were well documented long before the events of this week. It is a view that I have been victimised for expressing by those trying to protect themselves. Yet, this has not deterred me from saying what needed to be said.
__i can’t help but involve myself in this type of thing - even if it is sometimes to my own detriment.. Even when I’m wrong I’m right__

The world wasn’t ready for coronavirus. It goes without saying, the NRL cannot be held to blame for this lockdown of our game and our economy. I take absolutely no joy in the pain everyone is feeling at this time as a result of the game’s suspension. __I will however take this opportunity to cough up a pandemic size dose of I told you so.__ Indeed, there are many members of our community who are suffering far worse than us. However, that does not excuse the fact the NRL should have been in a much stronger financial position to help the game, the clubs, the players and the fans, through this difficult period.

Instead, our game finds itself precariously placed from a financial perspective, offering little or no confidence to its stakeholders that we will all come out the other side. We are all hoping we do, but there are no guarantees.

~~Nine chief executive Hugh Marks~~ __Phil Gould__ forced the NRL to swallow some bitter medicine __and I should receive the NRL Noble Prize for curing the NRL’s Coronavirus__.

The coronavirus pandemic and the resultant economic turndown have finally brought the fragile nature of NRL financial management into the spotlight. Going forward, that’s not a bad thing.

Right from the outset, during this difficult period, I have used the phrase that it’s no good ""crying over spilt milk"" __Oak^TM__ . There has been no ""I told you so"". It is what it is. We need to deal with it. Panicking and pointing the finger of blame at past regimes or individuals wasn’t going to help the game. The time for review can come later. __its frustrating no one has listened to me before, hopefully they will this time__

Unfortunately, this did not stop the usual suspects from within the NRL leaking stories to the media to deflect blame from themselves and onto others. It’s called a pre-emptive strike: getting in first and muddying the waters to absolve themselves of blame and to shut down anyone who may be looking to speak against them __See-Matt Moylan Mental health issues , Anthony Griffin has my full support etc__.

For instance, blaming the greed of the 16 NRL clubs and the players for our game’s current financial plight, or trying to portray broadcast partner Nine as the bad guy in this situation because it refused to give the NRL more money when no football was being played (note that Foxtel has withheld its quarterly payments as well), are just some of the more childish and inaccurate responses. Sadly, this is very typical behaviour from an organisation that conducts its affairs more like a political party than a professional sport governing body.

~~I’d imagine~~ there were several things that irritated ~~Marks~~ __Phil Gould__ and led to ~~the~~ comments ~~he~~ __I__ delivered to the NRL this week.

Firstly, I refer to what I’ve just written above..

 __All Work and no play makes Gus a dull boy__
__All Work and no play makes Gus a dull boy__

The NRL and sections of the media trying to represent ~~Nine~~ __Phil Gould__, the NRL clubs and the players as the bad guys in this predicament. Not on.

Secondly, and most importantly, I ~~would imagine he~~ found it strange, if not disrespectful, that ~~Nine~~ __Phil Gould__ had not been invited to any of the discussions regarding a revised competition structure for this year, starting dates and potential venues. ~~He~~ __I__ was made aware the NRL was about to announce a recommencement date on Thursday. As of late Wednesday night, no one from the NRL had contacted ~~Nine~~ __Phil Gould__ to advise ~~them~~ __me__  of this decision, nor the reasons behind it.

Blaming the clubs is a diversionary tactic. They are not the bad guys.
Thirdly, it appeared the NRL was marching forward in the belief that any rugby league content they could provide between now and Christmas would satisfy the terms of the broadcast deal. I’m sure this had ~~media broadcasters~~ __Phil Gould__ , corporate partners and sponsors scratching their heads. It’s not how the business world works, particularly when all businesses are suffering greatly at the hands of this enforced economic lockdown.

It's like having a friend who consistently asked you to loan them money and every time they asked you for a loan it was more than the time before. And if this friend continually failed to repay these loans, and if you then observed this friend’s lifestyle, showing they enjoyed a carefree existence of extravagance and waste with little regard for the money you loaned them, or the obligation to pay it back, then what would you think?

It gets to a point where you’d actually be doing them a favour by saying ""no more"". And if he is a true friend, you’d take some positive action to help them realise the error of their ways and help them to manage their money better in the future. If your friend failed to take this advice, there is not much else you can do for them.

If you knew the real truth behind the NRL’s financial management over a long period of time you would be shocked. If you knew the number of times the NRL has had to lean on ~~broadcasters~~ __Phil Gould__ for advances, loans and renegotiations of their existing contracts to make up for financial shortfalls, you would be staggered. You have no idea how often television broadcasters have bailed out this game from financial embarrassment, only to see the game knocking on the door again looking for more assistance.

If you knew the number of times the NRL has had to lean on broadcasters for advances, loans and contract renegotiations, you'd be staggered.
It doesn’t stop there: calling on corporate partners and sponsors to prepay future financial agreements to assist in the NRL’s failing cash flow; applying for loans from financial institutions to cover short-term deficiencies, only to be knocked back; short-changing NRL clubs and players, misrepresenting the game’s financial position to them to talk down their demands or needs.

There is more. 

Yet these people have the hide to induce criticism of others to protect themselves.

Now, while everyone went into immediate meltdown at the comments from ~~Nine~~ __Phil Gould__, Australian Rugby League Commission chairman Peter V’landys handled the broadcaster’s statement with the utmost dignity and professionalism.

V’Landys apologised to ~~Nine~~ __Phil Gould__ for the miscommunication that led to their frustration. He agreed with their criticism of the NRL’s cost structures. He agreed these were unsustainable and there needs to be significant change in the way the NRL manages its finances.

V’landys is a true leader. So too is ~~Marks~~ __Phil Gould__. It’s my belief in both these men that assures me ~~rugby league~~ __Democratic Peoples Republic of National Gould League__ will come out the other side of this disaster a better game, with a brighter future.

The two men are scheduled to meet on Tuesday. I imagine scant discussion of the events of this week. What needed to be said has been said. They will move on quickly. 

__Listening to the opinions of lesser men, is an unnecessary waste of the great leaders time__
__All pigs are created equal but some are more equal than others’__

More importantly, ~~they’ll~~ __we’ll__ be discussing how our game can best survive this challenge, what rugby league looks like in the future and how ~~the broadcast partners~~ __Phil Gould__ can assist in the creation of a new world for rugby league.

Big questions have been asked about the NRL's financial management of the game over a long period of time.

Do you really expect ~~any broadcasters~~ __Phil Gould__ , corporate partners or sponsors will be investing one more cent into the NRL without assurances on how this money will be spent for the betterment of the game?

The mindset and philosophies of our governing body need to change significantly. I could talk on this stuff for hours.

The comments by Nine this week and the acknowledgement of ~~Marks'~~ __Phil Goulds__ concerns by V’landys will go down as a defining moment in the history of rugby league. I see it as that significant.

I have great confidence in ~~these men~~ __Phil Gould__ leading the game into a new world. It is a world that will extend way beyond my lifetime. For the first time in a long time, though, I believe the game is in very good hands __Mine muhahaha__.

We will bounce back."

Sorry for the late replies, I have been trying to adapt to the coronavirus effect. My current courier (royalmail) are severely delayed and I have been trying to sign a new contract with another courier which I will be using long term (DPD). The new account was suppose to be signed up by this week however it is still incomplete due to coronavirus.

Therefore, I am shutting up shop for now as I don't want customers to wait longer than they have to. I will open up again once things get better

For all customers that have placed an order and still waiting dispatch, I sincerely apologise for the situation and I wish I can provide you high quality customer service that I normally can. Therefore, I am happy if you wish to wait until this new courier is set up or if you wish a refund and order a later date is perfectly fine with me.

Thank you for all the support, I really appreciate it!

Please everyone, stay at home and be safe!

Kind Regards,

###Tips For Social Distancing, Quarantine, And Isolation During An Infectious Disease Outbreak

**What Is Social Distancing?**

Social distancing is a way to keep people from interacting closely or frequently enough to spread an infectious disease. Schools and other gathering places such as movie theaters may close, and sports events and religious services may be cancelled.

**What Is Quarantine?**

Quarantine separates and restricts the movement of people who have been exposed to a contagious disease to see if they become sick. It lasts long enough to ensure the person has not contracted an infectious disease.

**What Is Isolation?**

Isolation prevents the spread of an infectious disease by separating people who are sick from those who are not. It lasts as long as the disease is contagious.

##What To Expect: Typical Reactions

Everyone reacts differently to stressful situations such as an infectious disease outbreak that requires social distancing, quarantine, or isolation. People may feel:

- **Anxiety, worry, or fear related to**:  
- Your own health status  
- The health status of others whom you may have exposed to the disease  
- The resentment that your friends and family may feel if they need to go into quarantine as a result of contact with you  
- The experience of monitoring yourself, or being monitored by others for signs and symptoms of the disease  
- Time taken off from work and the potential loss of income and job security  
- The challenges of securing things you need, such as groceries and personal care items  
- **Concern** about being able to effectively care for children or others in your care  
- **Uncertainty or frustration** about how long you will need to remain in this situation, and uncertainty about the future  
- **Loneliness** associated with feeling cut off from the world and from loved ones  
- **Anger** if you think you were exposed to the disease because of others’ negligence  
- **Boredom and frustration** because you may not be able to work or engage in regular day-to-day activities  
- **Uncertainty or ambivalence** about the situation  
- **A desire** to use alcohol or drugs to cope  
- **Symptoms of depression**, such as feelings of hopelessness, changes in appetite, or sleeping too little or too much  
- **Symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD)**, such as intrusive distressing memories, flashbacks (reliving the event), nightmares, changes in thoughts and mood, and being easily startled.

##Ways To Support Yourself During Social Distancing, Quarantine, and Isolation

#UNDERSTAND THE RISK

Consider the real risk of harm to yourself and others around you. The public perception of risk during a situation such as an infectious disease outbreak is often inaccurate. Media coverage may create the impression that people are in immediate danger when really the risk for infection may be very low. Take steps to get the facts:

- Stay up to date on what is happening, while limiting your media exposure. Avoid watching or listening to news reports 24/7 since this tends to increase anxiety and worry. Remember that children are especially affected by what they hear and see on television.  
- Look to credible sources for information on the infectious disease outbreak.

#BE YOUR OWN ADVOCATE

Speaking out about your needs is particularly important if you are in quarantine, since you may not be in a hospital or other facility where your basic needs are met. Ensure you have what you need to feel safe, secure, and comfortable.

- Work with local, state, or national health officials to find out how you can arrange for groceries and toiletries to be delivered to your home as needed.  
- Inform health care providers or health authorities of any needed medications and work with them to ensure that you continue to receive those medications.

#EDUCATE YOURSELF

Health care providers and health authorities should provide information on the disease, its diagnosis, and treatment.

- Do not be afraid to ask questions—clear communication with a health care provider may help reduce any distress associated with social distancing, quarantine, or isolation.  
- Ask for written information when available.  
- Ask a family member or friend to obtain information in the event that you are unable to secure this information on your own.

#WORK WITH YOUR EMPLOYER TO REDUCE FINANCIAL STRESS

If you’re unable to work during this time, you may experience stress related to your job status or financial situation.

- Provide your employer with a clear explanation of why you are away from work.  
- Contact the U.S. Department of Labor tollfree at 1-866-487-2365 about the Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA), which allows U.S. employees up to 12 weeks of unpaid leave for serious medical conditions, or to care for a family member with a serious medical condition.  
- Contact your utility providers, cable and Internet provider, and other companies from whom you get monthly bills to explain your situation and request alternative bill payment arrangements as needed.

#CONNECT WITH OTHERS

Reaching out to people you trust is one of the best ways to reduce anxiety, depression, loneliness, and boredom during social distancing, quarantine, and isolation. You can:

- Use the telephone, email, text messaging, and social media to connect with friends, family, and others.  
- Talk “face to face” with friends and loved ones using Skype or FaceTime.  
- If approved by health authorities and your health care providers, arrange for your friends and loved ones to bring you newspapers, movies, and books.  
- Sign up for emergency alerts via text or email to ensure you get updates as soon as they are available.  
- Call SAMHSA’s free 24-hour Disaster Distress Helpline at 1-800-985-5990, if you feel lonely or need support.  
- Use the Internet, radio, and television to keep up with local, national, and world events.  
- If you need to connect with someone because of an ongoing alcohol or drug problem, consider calling your local Alcoholics Anonymous or Narcotics Anonymous offices.

#TALK TO YOUR DOCTOR

If you are in a medical facility, you may have access to health care providers who can answer your questions. However, if you are quarantined at home, and you’re worried about physical symptoms you or your loved ones may be experiencing, call your doctor or other health care provider:

- Ask your provider whether it would be possible to schedule remote appointments via Skype or FaceTime for mental health, substance use, or physical health needs.

#USE PRACTICAL WAYS TO COPE AND RELAX

- Relax your body often by doing things that work for you-take deep breaths, stretch, meditate or pray, or engage in activities you enjoy.  
- Pace yourself between stressful activities, and do something fun after a hard task.  
- Talk about your experiences and feelings to loved ones and friends, if you find it helpful.  
- Maintain a sense of hope and positive thinking; consider keeping a journal where you write down things you are grateful for or that are going well

2020-04-11,peterpanic32,news,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/news/comments/fydy0p/tokyo_olympic_ceo_hints_games_could_be_in_doubt/fn4cbma/,"> Dude, you don't even understand average is not median. Median means you can expect 50% of cases at that time, leaving you with an additional 50% to go. See, you don't even understand what you are reading. 

Are you stupid?

Yes, 50% die after the median, but 50% also die BEFORE. 

Additionally, I said average / median quite specifically - because I know exactly what they mean and they're both quite close in current estimates. 

> That's how median works. It means you should take whatever the CFR is on the median-th day of mortality, and multiply it by 2 to get a reasonable estimation. But you're not doing that because you lack very basic understanding of statistics.

Awww. That's so stupid it's almost cute. Just think that through again. 

> When it comes to CFR it acts as a blind study when we look at how the infection takes hold of an infected population. You are right in that Diamond Princess doesn't function as a blind study when it comes to how fast it spreads etc, I don't even care about those numbers, but all we have to do is track populations that we know are infected, asymptomatically or symptomatically, and see how they do. That's blind with respect to CFR.

> Basically any group, no matter how they were sampled, of actively infected people can be used to determine a mortality rate. Diamond Princess fits that bill.

No... You did try to tell me I have no understanding of statistics, didn't you (despite numerous academic and professional points to the contrary, but I won't appeal to those besides in passing). And yet you wrote this? If your sample is biased, so too will be your conclusions from analysis on your sample. You can try to correct for them through various statistical methodologies, but it's not perfect - and nothing can completely control for it. That's why randomizing / removing bias from your sample is critical. 

> And you keep saying you linked me to a DHHS study, which reviewing your posts is https://www.cebm.net/covid-19/global-covid-19-case-fatality-rates/

[I linked this as well if you take another look.](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8209071/Model-shows-spike-coronavirus-case-summer-lockdown-lifted.html?ns_mchannel=rss&ns_campaign=1490&ito=1490) 

""The analysis I mentioned in my last comment was from this week."" - was what I said. 

> In no place, at all, in these analysis, does it say anything remotely close to what you're saying, unless you're looking specifically at females aged 30-39. It's much more in line with 1% CFR, in fact I think from the age-related CFR breakdown it's reporting even higher than 1%.

Ah, well that would require you to read it. I actually did slightly mischaracterize their data - they updated it. But their conclusion from all of the analysis in the article - ""Taking account of historical experience, trends in the data, increased number of infections in the population at largest, and potential impact of misclassification of deaths gives a presumed estimate for the COVID-19 IFR between 0.1% and 0.39%.*"""

## Abstract: In order to evaluate the efficacy of convalescent plasma therapy in the treatment of patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), 80 SARS patients were given convalescent plasma at Prince of Wales Hospital, Hong Kong, between 20 March and 26 May 2003. Good outcome was defined as discharge by day 22 following the onset of SARS symptoms. Poor outcome was defined as death or hospitalization beyond 22 days. A higher day-22 discharge rate was observed among patients who were given convalescent plasma before day 14 of illness (58.3% vs 15.6%; P<0.001) and among those who were PCR positive and seronegative for coronavirus at the time of plasma infusion (66.7% vs 20%; P=0.001)."

**But yes, I agree, Google the facts yourself. The truth probably lies somewhere in the middle, because there is propaganda being spread by both sides.**

> November 17: First known case of COVID-19 in Wuhan China

Read your own source. It's a study that was done retrospectively, and TRACED BACK the first positive case to a man in Nov 07. This was done my scientists to map out early transmission and to find how undetected and undocumented cases contributed to it. It did not imply that China knew about the existence of the coronavirus since Nov. 

> December 27: Chinese laboratories sequencing the coronavirus are ordered by authorities to hand over or destroy their samples and NOT release their findings:

Having a centralised government body, like the CDC, do the testing is standard procedure. [Take a look at the US, FDA regulations essentially mirrored what the China did.](https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2020/mar/23/dan-crenshaw/did-fda-regulations-slow-testing-coronavirus/). 

It's for good reason too. 1. Not every lab has the bio-safety facilities in place to deal with a virus this dangerous and 2. Governments cannot guarantee the accuracy and reliability of the testing done in private/local labs. 

> December 31: Taiwan notifies the World Health Organization of Coronavirus human-to-human transmission. The WHO ignores Taiwan's warning and chooses NOT to notify other nations. 

And here we are, back to the topic at hand. Did Taiwan truly warned and notified the WHO about h2h transmission? After reading the mail I think most people would agree that they absolutely did not."

###Tips For Social Distancing, Quarantine, And Isolation During An Infectious Disease Outbreak

**What Is Social Distancing?**

Social distancing is a way to keep people from interacting closely or frequently enough to spread an infectious disease. Schools and other gathering places such as movie theaters may close, and sports events and religious services may be cancelled.

**What Is Quarantine?**

Quarantine separates and restricts the movement of people who have been exposed to a contagious disease to see if they become sick. It lasts long enough to ensure the person has not contracted an infectious disease.

**What Is Isolation?**

Isolation prevents the spread of an infectious disease by separating people who are sick from those who are not. It lasts as long as the disease is contagious.

##What To Expect: Typical Reactions

Everyone reacts differently to stressful situations such as an infectious disease outbreak that requires social distancing, quarantine, or isolation. People may feel:

- **Anxiety, worry, or fear related to**:  
- Your own health status  
- The health status of others whom you may have exposed to the disease  
- The resentment that your friends and family may feel if they need to go into quarantine as a result of contact with you  
- The experience of monitoring yourself, or being monitored by others for signs and symptoms of the disease  
- Time taken off from work and the potential loss of income and job security  
- The challenges of securing things you need, such as groceries and personal care items  
- **Concern** about being able to effectively care for children or others in your care  
- **Uncertainty or frustration** about how long you will need to remain in this situation, and uncertainty about the future  
- **Loneliness** associated with feeling cut off from the world and from loved ones  
- **Anger** if you think you were exposed to the disease because of others’ negligence  
- **Boredom and frustration** because you may not be able to work or engage in regular day-to-day activities  
- **Uncertainty or ambivalence** about the situation  
- **A desire** to use alcohol or drugs to cope  
- **Symptoms of depression**, such as feelings of hopelessness, changes in appetite, or sleeping too little or too much  
- **Symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD)**, such as intrusive distressing memories, flashbacks (reliving the event), nightmares, changes in thoughts and mood, and being easily startled.

##Ways To Support Yourself During Social Distancing, Quarantine, and Isolation

#UNDERSTAND THE RISK

Consider the real risk of harm to yourself and others around you. The public perception of risk during a situation such as an infectious disease outbreak is often inaccurate. Media coverage may create the impression that people are in immediate danger when really the risk for infection may be very low. Take steps to get the facts:

- Stay up to date on what is happening, while limiting your media exposure. Avoid watching or listening to news reports 24/7 since this tends to increase anxiety and worry. Remember that children are especially affected by what they hear and see on television.  
- Look to credible sources for information on the infectious disease outbreak.

#BE YOUR OWN ADVOCATE

Speaking out about your needs is particularly important if you are in quarantine, since you may not be in a hospital or other facility where your basic needs are met. Ensure you have what you need to feel safe, secure, and comfortable.

- Work with local, state, or national health officials to find out how you can arrange for groceries and toiletries to be delivered to your home as needed.  
- Inform health care providers or health authorities of any needed medications and work with them to ensure that you continue to receive those medications.

#EDUCATE YOURSELF

Health care providers and health authorities should provide information on the disease, its diagnosis, and treatment.

- Do not be afraid to ask questions—clear communication with a health care provider may help reduce any distress associated with social distancing, quarantine, or isolation.  
- Ask for written information when available.  
- Ask a family member or friend to obtain information in the event that you are unable to secure this information on your own.

#WORK WITH YOUR EMPLOYER TO REDUCE FINANCIAL STRESS

If you’re unable to work during this time, you may experience stress related to your job status or financial situation.

- Provide your employer with a clear explanation of why you are away from work.  
- Contact the U.S. Department of Labor tollfree at 1-866-487-2365 about the Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA), which allows U.S. employees up to 12 weeks of unpaid leave for serious medical conditions, or to care for a family member with a serious medical condition.  
- Contact your utility providers, cable and Internet provider, and other companies from whom you get monthly bills to explain your situation and request alternative bill payment arrangements as needed.

#CONNECT WITH OTHERS

Reaching out to people you trust is one of the best ways to reduce anxiety, depression, loneliness, and boredom during social distancing, quarantine, and isolation. You can:

- Use the telephone, email, text messaging, and social media to connect with friends, family, and others.  
- Talk “face to face” with friends and loved ones using Skype or FaceTime.  
- If approved by health authorities and your health care providers, arrange for your friends and loved ones to bring you newspapers, movies, and books.  
- Sign up for emergency alerts via text or email to ensure you get updates as soon as they are available.  
- Call SAMHSA’s free 24-hour Disaster Distress Helpline at 1-800-985-5990, if you feel lonely or need support.  
- Use the Internet, radio, and television to keep up with local, national, and world events.  
- If you need to connect with someone because of an ongoing alcohol or drug problem, consider calling your local Alcoholics Anonymous or Narcotics Anonymous offices.

#TALK TO YOUR DOCTOR

If you are in a medical facility, you may have access to health care providers who can answer your questions. However, if you are quarantined at home, and you’re worried about physical symptoms you or your loved ones may be experiencing, call your doctor or other health care provider:

- Ask your provider whether it would be possible to schedule remote appointments via Skype or FaceTime for mental health, substance use, or physical health needs.

#USE PRACTICAL WAYS TO COPE AND RELAX

- Relax your body often by doing things that work for you-take deep breaths, stretch, meditate or pray, or engage in activities you enjoy.  
- Pace yourself between stressful activities, and do something fun after a hard task.  
- Talk about your experiences and feelings to loved ones and friends, if you find it helpful.  
- Maintain a sense of hope and positive thinking; consider keeping a journal where you write down things you are grateful for or that are going well

Abstract

We identified seasonal human coronaviruses, influenza viruses and rhinoviruses in exhaled breath and coughs of children and adults with acute respiratory illness. Surgical face masks significantly reduced detection of influenza virus RNA in respiratory droplets and coronavirus RNA in aerosols, with a trend toward reduced detection of coronavirus RNA in respiratory droplets. Our results indicate that surgical face masks could prevent transmission of human coronaviruses and influenza viruses from symptomatic individuals."

- Use the Internet, radio, and television to keep up with local, national, and world events.  
- If you need to connect with someone because of an ongoing alcohol or drug problem, consider calling your local Alcoholics Anonymous or Narcotics Anonymous offices.

#TALK TO YOUR DOCTOR

If you are in a medical facility, you may have access to health care providers who can answer your questions. However, if you are quarantined at home, and you’re worried about physical symptoms you or your loved ones may be experiencing, call your doctor or other health care provider:

- Ask your provider whether it would be possible to schedule remote appointments via Skype or FaceTime for mental health, substance use, or physical health needs.

#USE PRACTICAL WAYS TO COPE AND RELAX

- Relax your body often by doing things that work for you-take deep breaths, stretch, meditate or pray, or engage in activities you enjoy.  
- Pace yourself between stressful activities, and do something fun after a hard task.  
- Talk about your experiences and feelings to loved ones and friends, if you find it helpful.  
- Maintain a sense of hope and positive thinking; consider keeping a journal where you write down things you are grateful for or that are going well

India's Foreign Secretary Harsh Shringla and Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Igor Morgulov held a telephonic conversation on Thursday to discuss the evolving situation related to the spread of the deadly virus.
Both of them exchanged notes on the national efforts underway in their respective countries to contain the outbreak of Covid-19.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Russian President Vladimir Putin discussed the issue through a teleconference last month on March 25.
Shringla and Morgulov stressed on the close bilateral cooperation between the two countries in ensuring the welfare of each other''s citizens in their respective countries. There are around 15,000 Indian students in Russia and about 5,000 Russian tourists in India. Morgulov also thanked Shringla for facilitating the evacuation of Russian nationals from India.
Referring to the Russian chairmanship of BRICS and SCO, Morgulov informed Shringla of various preparatory meetings which would continue to take place through video conferencing in the coming days.
The telephonic discussion between Shringla and Morgulov came two days after India, in view of the humanitarian aspects of the pandemic, decided to lift the ban on the export of Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ). HCQ is being used to treat Covid-19 patients and as prophylactic by the frontline healthcare workers deployed in the fight against the coronavirus pandemic. The Modi government had imposed a ban on export of the drug since the coronavirus outbreak hit India.
The government is now licencing paracetamol and HCQ in appropriate quantities to neighbouring countries which are dependent on Indian capabilities and also supplying the drugs to the US and some other nations badly affected by the pandemic.
Russia as of now has over 10,000 Covid-19 positive cases while 76 people have succumbed to the dreaded virus. In India, 186 people have died so far while over 6,200 persons have tested positive for Covid-19."

    Q But, Secretary Azar, if you were preparing for a pandemic, if this government were preparing for a pandemic, why is it we don’t have enough masks? Why is it we don’t have enough medical equipment in this country?

    THE PRESIDENT: Previous administrations gave us very little ammunition for the military and very little shelf space. Let me just tell you —

    Q But you’ve been President —

    THE PRESIDENT: You know it —

    Q You’ve been President —

    THE PRESIDENT: You know the answer.

    Q — three or four years now.

    THE PRESIDENT: The previous administration, the shelves were empty. The shelves were empty.

    Q You had time to stock the shelves.

    THE PRESIDENT: So what you should do is speak to the people from the previous administration, Jim, and ask them that question, because —

    Q Mr. President, you’ve been in office —

    THE PRESIDENT: — the shelves were empty.

    Q — for almost four years.

    THE PRESIDENT: And you know what else? The military shelves were also empty. We had no ammunition, literally. And that was said by one of your favorite generals. “We have — sir, we have no ammunition.” Guess what? We had very little medical supply also.

    All right. Go ahead, please.

    Q Isn’t that a cop-out, though?

    THE PRESIDENT: Go ahead.

    Q Isn’t that a cop-out?

    THE PRESIDENT: We’ll get it back. We’ll get you back.

    Q But, Mr. President —

    THE PRESIDENT: We’ll get you back, please.

    Q But what about that question —

    THE PRESIDENT: Jim, I said we’ll get you back.

    Please, go ahead.

So i'm out again. Not from the hospital. From my house. I am not even a recorded official incident for the Swedish state. I am one of the anonymous sufferers who either survive or die helplessly in their home. Two weeks of battle with the coronavirus. High fever, cough, body aches, convulsions. 14 days of constant agony. Next to Karin in every difficult moment. She was holding my hand and lying next to me. Two weeks have passed so that whatever love and admiration I had for the Swedish state to be annihilated.
A country that is shrouded in the myth of the state fighting for human values ​​around the world dooms to death whatever may stand in the way of its economic development.
What the officials of this state did to me, their medical staff, when I asked for their help on the 11th day, I wish no one else would suffer, but I wish them to live the worst and die like stray dogs on the street as I did when I was unloaded on the street outside the locked emergency door with a fever and a promise that they would come to pick me up. They never came and I stayed 45 minutes at the mercy of the cold wind. I had the Panol of the Middle Ages for them. But I still had oil in my candle. Assholes ..
I don't pretend to be brave, but the truth is that after several days having high fever, I wasn't afraid for my life. I settled my financial obligations, transferred the money to members of my family so that if there was no good outcome they would not have to deal with it. I gave my fight and whatever happens .. Once I just cried. When my partner told me about a 35-year-old father of three where the ambulance went to the house which his wife called for the second time and they were told that he would not go to the hospital because he is not old and he is strong and will fight it . The next day he died. I cried for this man. Not for me. I did not shed tears for myself. My partner did. Not me. I felt angry and I feel all this time. No fear. Anger because this otherwise developing state, with the expectation of ever-increasing growth, has lost what is called humanity and the barbarity that accompanies economic charts prevails.
So the Swedish model. My partner works as a nurse in a hospital. She had not even been informed that her patients were suspected of coronavirus. When I got stuck, they treated me like a leper. As I tell you. Like leprosy. The Swedish model is as follows. Is it financially advantageous for us to take measures in the long run? No. It will cost us much more if we try to limit the spread. So all the children go to school. Now, whether they transfer it to their parents and grandparents is a matter of individual responsibility. And of course they will go to school. How else will Dad and Mom go to work? There is no way to put a value on human life. The amount they pay for pensions and patient support is well known. Like the unbearable cost of taking measures. (Unbearable. But Greece of the Memoranda accepted it to save its citizens). So if you put the expenses that will arise from restrictive measures, it doesn't add up for.them. So let them die. The board says that in Sweden today are around 9000 cases and 800 died. But, they don't include me. Like those who die in their homes. Tests? What are talking about. There is no point. It destroy the statics and their image. The same is 9000 and the same is 60,000 ?. No, don't be crazy. The same is 800 deaths instead of 5000; Of course not. So let's not destroy the image of the state, the authorities are doing a good job here.
 So love Greece. Let's not talk bad about her. We do not have the money of the rich Europeans but we have respect and humanity. In the year 2020 we are still teaching culture.
