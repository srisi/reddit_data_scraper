Like, yeah, I probably can't conclusively prove to anyone that something \*didn't\* happen. But there being no evidence that it did happen is meaningful.

I haven't seen much in the way of unusual activity but since I'm more on the bio side I do see a disproportionate amount of bad science regarding this outbreak relative to less hot topics. The general public cares a whole lot more about what is happening with this coronavirus than just about anything else in biology right now, so as such there's a huge and necessary push to get data published quickly. A consequence of this though is having to explain that plenty of things you see on fancy websites from fancy labs are still devoid of substance."

Not a doctor here but: AGAIN NOT A DOCTOR BUT:

Maybe this is why (I don't remember what the study was but it was an early study in Canada with regards to the coronavirus there) when people were laying on their backs they didn't survive as well (like literally half as well) as when they were laying on their stomachs fighting the coronavirus they were studying there. I also don't know how they had live patients or whether they were actually human. Sorry. Anyways, I couldn't get it out of my head. If if you are laying on your stomach you are much more prone to expelling mucus and such from your nasal passages directly out your nose then swallowing and coughing it up.

So maybe one of the ways to fight is to make sure that you keep the pharynx (back of your throat around the entrance to the lungs) clear. e.g. 

Resting for a while with your head lower then your chest to encourage drainage. 

Tapping your chest regulary to make sure you clear out crap that needs to be cleared.

Vaping using propylene glycol can cause long term inflammation in the lungs. However propylene glycol has also been shown to kill the flu virus. Steam is moisture in the air (obviously) which helps the body expel mucus from the airways. Perhaps vaping temporarily during the flu season or when you feel the onset of flu like symptoms might keep the virus from sticking around in your nasal tract.

During a flu bout, doing salt water nasal flushes can also be quite painful. But if you can do them, you not only clear out the goop, but the salt water kills off and/or reduces a goodly amount of the virus in your sinuses. 

Just taking a towel and running hot water in the sink (and/or filling the sink with hot water) under your head can also give you steam which will be used to keep mucus moist and get it out of your system.
 
Anything to clear the pharynx and reduce the consistent re-infection through viral load in the environment (in this case the pharynx and nasal tract).

Again, not a doctor."

1, A doctor’s general description of symptoms for the first three weeks of illness.

2. A day by day description of symptoms (from day 1 through day 12) and treatment for the first patient in the USA. He began feeling ill on Jan. 15, was admitted to the hospital on Jan. 20th, and was released from the hospital Feb. 3rd/4.


Item 1:
Symptoms explained by Doctor ihttps://www.straitstimes.com/asia/east-asia/reporters-notebook-life-and-death-in-a-wuhan-coronavirus-icu: 

“I've observed that the breakout period of the novel coronavirus tends to be three weeks, from the onset of symptoms to developing difficulties breathing. Basically going from mild to severe symptoms takes about a week. There are all sorts of mild symptoms: feebleness, shortness of breath, some people have fevers, some don't. Based on studies of our 138 cases, the most common symptoms in the first stage are fever (98.6 per cent of cases), feebleness (69.6 per cent), cough (59.4 per cent), muscle pains (34.8 per cent), difficulties breathing (31.2%), while less common symptoms include headaches, dizziness, stomach pain, diarrhea, nausea, vomiting.

But some patients who enter the second week will suddenly get worse. At this stage, people should go to the hospital. The elderly with underlying conditions may develop complications; some may need machine-assisted respiration. When the body's other organs start to fail, that's when it becomes severe, while those with strong immune systems see their symptoms decrease in severity at this stage and gradually recover. So the second week is what determines whether the illness becomes critical.

The third week determines whether critical illness leads to death. Some in critical condition who receive treatment can raise their level of lymphocytes, a type of white blood cell, and see an improvement in their immune systems, and have been brought back, so to speak. But those whose lymphocyte numbers continue to decline, those whose immune systems are destroyed in the end, experience multiple organ failure and die.

For most, the illness is over in two weeks, whereas for those for whom the illness becomes severe, if they can survive three weeks, they're good. Those that can't will die in three weeks.”


Item 2:

Symptom Progression Day 1 to Day 12 From
First Case of 2019 Novel Coronavirus in the United States 

35 year old male

https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2001191

On January 19, 2020, a 35-year-old man presented to an urgent care clinic in Snohomish County, Washington, with a 4-day history of cough and subjective fever. On checking into the clinic, the patient put on a mask in the waiting room. After waiting approximately 20 minutes, he was taken into an examination room and underwent evaluation by a provider. He disclosed that he had returned to Washington State on January 15 after traveling to visit family in Wuhan, China. The patient stated that he had seen a health alert from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) about the novel coronavirus outbreak in China and, because of his symptoms and recent travel, decided to see a health care provider....

Given the patient’s travel history, the local and state health departments were immediately notified. Together with the urgent care clinician, the Washington Department of Health notified the CDC Emergency Operations Center. Although the patient reported that he had not spent time at the Huanan seafood market and reported no known contact with ill persons during his travel to China, CDC staff concurred with the need to test the patient for 2019-nCoV on the basis of current CDC “persons under investigation” case definitions.8 Specimens were collected in accordance with CDC guidance and included serum and nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swab specimens. After specimen collection, the patient was discharged to home isolation with active monitoring by the local health department.
On January 20, 2020, the CDC confirmed that the patient’s nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabs tested positive for 2019-nCoV by real-time reverse-transcriptase–polymerase-chain-reaction (rRT-PCR) assay. In coordination with CDC subject-matter experts, state and local health officials, emergency medical services, and hospital leadership and staff, the patient was admitted to an airborne-isolation unit at Providence Regional Medical Center for clinical observation, with health care workers following CDC recommendations for contact, droplet, and airborne precautions with eye protection.

On admission, the patient reported persistent dry cough and a 2-day history of nausea and vomiting; he reported that he had no shortness of breath or chest pain. Vital signs were within normal ranges. On physical examination, the patient was found to have dry mucous membranes. The remainder of the examination was generally unremarkable. After admission, the patient received supportive care, including 2 liters of normal saline and ondansetron for nausea.


On days 2 through 5 of hospitalization (days 6 through 9 of illness), the patient’s vital signs remained largely stable, apart from the development of intermittent fevers accompanied by periods of tachycardia (Figure 2). The patient continued to report a nonproductive cough and appeared fatigued. On the afternoon of hospital day 2, the patient passed a loose bowel movement and reported abdominal discomfort. A second episode of loose stool was reported overnight; a sample of this stool was collected for rRT-PCR testing, along with additional respiratory specimens (nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal) and serum. The stool and both respiratory specimens later tested positive by rRT-PCR for 2019-nCoV, whereas the serum remained negative.

Treatment during this time was largely supportive. For symptom management, the patient received, as needed, antipyretic therapy consisting of 650 mg of acetaminophen every 4 hours and 600 mg of ibuprofen every 6 hours. He also received 600 mg of guaifenesin for his continued cough and approximately 6 liters of normal saline over the first 6 days of hospitalization.


A chest radiograph taken on hospital day 3 (illness day 7) was reported as showing no evidence of infiltrates or abnormalities (Figure 3). However, a second chest radiograph from the night of hospital day 5 (illness day 9) showed evidence of pneumonia in the lower lobe of the left lung (Figure 4). These radiographic findings coincided with a change in respiratory status starting on the evening of hospital day 5, when the patient’s oxygen saturation values as measured by pulse oximetry dropped to as low as 90% while he was breathing ambient air. On day 6, the patient was started on supplemental oxygen, delivered by nasal cannula at 2 liters per minute. Given the changing clinical presentation and concern about hospital-acquired pneumonia, treatment with vancomycin (a 1750-mg loading dose followed by 1 g administered intravenously every 8 hours) and cefepime (administered intravenously every 8 hours) was initiated.


On hospital day 6 (illness day 10), a fourth chest radiograph showed basilar streaky opacities in both lungs, a finding consistent with atypical pneumonia (Figure 5), and rales were noted in both lungs on auscultation. Given the radiographic findings, the decision to administer oxygen supplementation, the patient’s ongoing fevers, the persistent positive 2019-nCoV RNA at multiple sites, and published reports of the development of severe pneumonia3,4 at a period consistent with the development of radiographic pneumonia in this patient, clinicians pursued compassionate use of an investigational antiviral therapy. Treatment with intravenous remdesivir (a novel nucleotide analogue prodrug in development10,11) was initiated on the evening of day 7, and no adverse events were observed in association with the infusion. Vancomycin was discontinued on the evening of day 7, and cefepime was discontinued on the following day, after serial negative procalcitonin levels and negative nasal PCR testing for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus.

On hospital day 8 (illness day 12), the patient’s clinical condition improved. Supplemental oxygen was discontinued, and his oxygen saturation values improved to 94 to 96% while he was breathing ambient air. The previous bilateral lower-lobe rales were no longer present. His appetite improved, and he was asymptomatic aside from intermittent dry cough and rhinorrhea. 

As of January 30, 2020, the patient remains hospitalized. He is afebrile, and all symptoms have resolved with the exception of his cough, which is decreasing in severity.

Public-health officials in the U.S. are striving to keep tabs on thousands of Americans who have quarantined themselves at home after returning from mainland China to curtail the new coronavirus, adding to an epidemic response that is straining already-stretched local departments.
More than 5,400 people had been asked to self-quarantine in California alone as of Feb. 14, according to the California Department of Public Health. Hundreds more are self-quarantining in Georgia, Washington state, Illinois, New York and other states.
Public-health officials are following directions from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the State Department to supervise these people, but many steps are being developed on the fly. States are using a variety of techniques to track people from calling in volunteers to make phone calls, to sending text messages and using electronic registries.

These people are separate from the Americans who are under stricter federal quarantine, including those housed at four U.S. air bases and the 328 who were recently evacuated from the Diamond Princess cruise ship. Those groups arrived from locations where the virus was rapidly spreading, whereas the people self-monitoring at home are thought to be at lower risk of having been exposed to it.

So far, there have been 15 confirmed Covid-19 cases in the U.S., not including the potentially positive cases among those evacuated from the Diamond Princess. While health officials have investigated 467 people for the virus as of Monday, 392 tested negative, with 60 cases pending, according to the CDC. The immediate risk to the general public is still low, health officials say.
While public-health authorities are experienced with isolating, contact tracing and quarantining people to contain infectious diseases such as measles and tuberculosis, an attempt to monitor and quarantine people at this scale is a unique challenge. And quarantines typically apply only to those with a known exposure to a virus, rather than just travel history, public-health officials say.
“That’s a whole new scope of work,” Sara Cody, director of the public-health department in Santa Clara County, the home of Silicon Valley, which has had two confirmed cases of Covid-19. Both patients had returned from Wuhan, China, where the epidemic began.
TRACKING THE CORONAVIRUS

•Chinese officials celebrated a drop in the number of new coronavirus infections and deaths.
•China’s State Council called on “low-risk regions” around the country to resume full production.
•The Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention found that the most of confirmed cases were mild.
•The head of Wuhan’s Wuchang Hospital died of the coronavirus.
Tracking the Coronavirus
VIEW IN DEPTH
A coalition of staffers, employees from other departments, health-care providers and federal officials engaged in a classic outbreak response to monitor people, such as family and health-care workers, who came in close contact with two local cases. And now, the department has added tracking recent arrivals from China to their to-do list. “We’re still in the middle of figuring out these operations,” Dr. Cody said.
Travel from mainland China to the U.S. has been sharply curtailed since many airlines suspended flights and the U.S. barred entry to most foreign nationals arriving from China. Still, some Americans continue to arrive into 11 airports designated by federal officials, and health authorities are on the lookout for passengers who are coming from other countries but were also recently in China.
Los Angeles County, for instance, is adding dozens of returning travelers to its monitoring list daily, said Barbara Ferrer, the director for the L.A. County Department of Public Health.
Those without symptoms who haven’t been to Hubei province, which includes Wuhan, are allowed to go on to their final destinations, but are asked to stay at home for up to 14 days, monitor their health, check in with their local health departments and contact their health-care providers if they develop symptoms, such as a fever or dry cough.
They are asked to avoid close contact with others, typically defined as being within 6 feet of another person for a prolonged period. Sometimes those who are self-quarantining are told they may go outside and exercise if no one is nearby, or grocery shop. The orders aren’t binding, but local health officials can issue stricter quarantine orders if necessary. So far, most people are cooperative, local health officials say.

State and local health officials say they get information on people who are self-quarantining from federal officials who screen them at airports. But sometimes local officials receive incorrect or illegible phone numbers for some, or just missing data for others, and have to circle back to federal authorities for more information to track down the person.
Seattle and King County in Washington state, which have roughly 400 people self-monitoring at home, have recruited volunteers from the University of Washington School of Public Health and the department’s Public Health Reserve Corps, said Jeffrey Duchin, the health officer at Public Health—Seattle and King County. The county is spending roughly $200,000 a week on the response, which also requires redirecting staff from other tasks.

For people under strict quarantine or in isolation after developing symptoms, public-health workers sometimes need to provide more intense services, including shopping for food and medication. Seattle and King County offer a dietitian-reviewed menu and deliver bagels, turkey lunch meat, avocado salsa, fruit and hair conditioner, among other items, to a person under investigation waiting for test results.
“The amount of manpower, both resources and time, has been tremendous, and so what that means is that our existing staff are working two jobs around the clock for several weeks,” said Dr. Duchin. “It’s been like one big, long bad day.”

In Chicago, the health department is surveying people daily with an electronic registry, which is part of its monitoring practice for other infectious diseases, and is in contact with them more directly as needed. Other health departments phone or email initially, then sometimes follow up in a few days or a week.
On Monday, the Washington State Department of Health started using a text-messaging system developed by the CDC. The state will send a daily text to new arrivals and will refer anyone who reports fever or other symptoms to their local health departments. Washington says it is the first state to use the system. The CDC has made the tool available to any interested health departments and is using it to check in on some of its own staff on the ground responding to the epidemic in the U.S., said Anita Patel, the lead of pandemic medical care and countermeasures at the CDC.

Public-health authorities say they are also working to fight xenophobia and misinformation around the virus. The Chicago Department of Public Health held a press conference in Chinatown last week to announce that all of the close contacts of their two Covid-19 cases had passed the incubation period and had been cleared—and then the team had lunch with local business leaders in Chinatown.
The effort is straining state and local budgets. States and some larger local departments receive support from the CDC’s Public Health Emergency Preparedness funds, though the money is meant for preparing for an outbreak and doesn’t often cover full responses, they say.
“We’ve been keeping close track of those costs and expenditures with the assumption that there would be additional funding available in time,” said Allison Arwady, the commissioner at the Chicago Department of Public Health. “We’re paying our bills right now, but we absolutely need additional funding to be able to maintain the level of response this is going to require.”
Many health departments say they are in a good spot for now, as close contacts to the early confirmed cases are passing the incubation period without new infections popping up. But based on the continuing spread of the coronavirus, some health officials expect to be on high alert for the long-term, saying this type of aggressive response might not be sustainable. Strategies might also need to shift if the virus gets a foothold in the U.S.
“I just look around, and there are a lot of people here because they’re just committed to the mission, but they’re getting tired,” said Dr. Cody. “This is what they believe in, and that takes us a long way, but it won’t take us for months and months and months.”"

In the US \~ 8% of people get flu a year.   
Let's say that 75% of those get it during flu season, a number I pulled out of my ass.  
That implies 19.6 million flu cases every flu season.   


According to some other random websites, flu typically peaks Feb, December, March, January in that order of severity, with cases tapering off by April. So let's say there's a 6 month flu season, autumn and winter, and therefore there'd be about 3 million cases in any given month. I won't bother doing more back of the envelope shit for how long each of Covid19 and the flu last.  


What is clear is that if you have flu-like symptoms in the West, you almost certainly have the flu at this point... as we move into April, May etc. and seasonal flu tapers off, if Covid continues to grow, then your odds of it being coronavirus go up"

I think it is heading in a good direction on r/Coronavirus. Before, I felt like the subs had little differentiation between them and what would be acceptable content for each subreddit. Now that we did the switch, I feel like we made the ""identities"" and rules of the subs much more clear.

> Have you noticed any unusual activity that you believe might be related to efforts to manipulate the narrative?

Like any large sub we get brigaded from different userbases. It can come from both sides, but we do our best to mitigate the effects of this. We also have to deal with sources that are less than credible, where the news source is clearly trying to spin a certain narrative. 

> Have you been in contact with any news organizations or have they reached out to you at all?

Not personally, nor am I aware of any news outlets reaching out to any other mods.

We appreciate the support. It can be tough when a vocal minority believes we are ""CCP shills"" or are ""censoring"" information. Of course we will make mistakes as we are not infallible - most of us are just scientists that are volunteering our time to help people have easier access the best, most reliable and up-to-date information available (as well as keep out the racists and trolls).

My personal view as a mod in what we are trying to do for the sub(s) is to provide a platform where we can have good, reliable sources from around the world congregate in order to have a place to for people to discuss the facts as well as a place for people to stay up to date on the virus. Unfortunately, there are a lot of sources out there that will post news stories without it being verified, leading to unnecessary fear mongering/anxiety and further exacerbates the spread of misinformation."

Unfortunately that results in retail and food service employees coming in and spreading illnesses around the whole crew and customers especially in winter. Lord help us if Coronavirus gets into that rotation.

If people could stay home while sick without worrying about their livelihood I wonder how bad the flu season would be.  Praying for SK and us all."

2020-02-19,Eversnuffley,Coronavirus,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/f6jaku/coronavirus_growth_extrapolation_outside_china/fi53z24/,"Update to Feb 19, 2020.

Please note that this will be my last post in this particular format. The 2-factor polynomial curve isn't a great fit any more, so I will be working on a new format to show the ongoing growth of worldwide numbers.

For those who continue to post suggestions about breaking out cruise infections, please note that this is intended to show the progressive growth of cases worldwide. There is no doubt that the cruise numbers have a major impact on the growth. Others have helpfully provided links to graphs that break these numbers out. Eventually the spike will work itself out. The purpose of this graph is to get an overall sense of the disease progress globally. The only reason China's numbers are not included is because there is significant doubt as to the veracity of these numbers, and so the decision was made from the beginning to leave them out. Everything else, including cruise numbers, are included to give us an evolving sense of the global situation.

Our world is in this for the long haul, and the more we know, the better we will be able to respond as a planet.

Thank you for all the encouraging messages from those who are finding this format helpful!

\-------

This is an animated gif showing the changing trendline day over day, as compared to the original extrapolation from Feb 1, 2020.

Methodology:Original extrapolation is a 2-factor polynomial best fit from Feb 1, 2020 (green line and dots). Each day I am plotting a new 2-factor polynomial best fit (blue line) from the actual data (blue dots). By comparing the blue and green lines, we can get a sense of how the rate of growth is growing (or shrinking) by comparison.

Original best fit polynomial equation: 0.5869x2+5.53664x - 10.162, where x is days since January 20 (start of data)

To preface, I will acknowledge that my belief in the Canadian Healthcare System might be a bit misplaced at times, but I do feel very strongly that our people have the population's best interests in mind.

I find that the media coverage in Canada to be a little underreported.  It is difficult to find out what exactly is going on in Ontario or BC when one or the other has reported a new case.  When that happens, the focus shifts away from the national news and more into the local coverage of how the public health department is handling the case(s).  In the case of Ontario, I feel that the focus needs to be more national rather than local; I don't care about the local coverage because I'm smart enough to go look for it -- I care more that the coverage is exposing the rest of the population of the seriousness of this virus.  

So when logging onto /r/Coronavirus or /r/COVID19, I find a great deal of relief to see there's common sense discussion.  At times, I find the community negativity to be undergirded by the mistakes made by our team of biting into more than we could chew before the recent influx of new moderators.  But I must say that we're getting better control over the fake news that often get posted -- our users are the best deterrents and you've all done a smashing job of helping us.

As for unusual activities, I haven't found anything, but I have found that people are trying to monetize the virus by spamming their crappy websites.  I've caught a few already, but there's always one in the background I haven't caught yet.  I'm keeping my eye out of those posts, but I think our team has been handling the issue brilliantly so far.  

We haven't had any MSM reach out to us to discuss the subreddits, but I do know a couple of us do reach out to verify information.  I think this is an important relationship that needs more nurturing because it will grant more reliability to the sources that are posted here.  I know we have discussed plans for having a dedicated list of sources to be permitted for posting within the subreddits (/r/Coronavirus and /r/China_Flu), but it's a big undertaking.  

I'm happy to hear that our work is being acknowledged, but there's still a great deal of work to do.  I want to have more consideration paid towards how our users title submissions and more consideration to encouraging scientific discussions in /r/COVID19 so that our users there feel more emboldened to discuss the problems we (the research community) might not have considered.

There's a lot of incredibly gifted people in each subreddit, and I'm always amazed by the creativeness of our users graphs and charts.  /r/dataisbeautiful would love some of them."

The death toll from China's coronavirus epidemic climbed to 1,868 on Tuesday morning as 98 more people died while the total number of confirmed cases jumped to 72,436.  
Of the new deaths, 93 were reported from Hubei Province, the epicentre of the virus, three from Henan, and one each from Hebei and Hunan.
Hubei reported 1,807 new confirmed cases, taking the total number of such cases to 59,989 in the province. Another 1,432 new suspected cases were reported from the rest of China.
A total of 358 people of 406 who were housed at an ITBP quarantine facility in Chhawla after being brought back from Wuhan have been released. All 406 have tested negative for novel Coronavirus in the latest sample examination and are being discharged in a phased manner . It is likely that all 406 will be released by Wednesday early morning from the ITBP Chhawla Centre. 
All released persons are advised to remain self isolated for the next 14 days at their respective places. They are also advised for do's and dont's during the period. 
Many of the people who were told that they would be allowed to go from the centre celebrated the moment with an impromptu dance and music show.
A total of 650 people were brought back from Wuhan in China on February 1 and 2 in two 747 Boeing Air India aircraft after the outbreak of the novel Coronavirus in China. While 406 of these are being looked after at the ITBP facility, rest are at an Army centre at Manesar in Haryana.

> SINGAPORE: The Government is taking proactive steps to secure essential supplies, including masks, in light of tightened export regulations in other countries, the Ministry of National Development (MND) said on Tuesday (Feb 18).

> In a written response to a parliamentary question from Ang Mo Kio MP Gan Thiam Poh, the ministry also said that the Government is strengthening the resilience of its supply chain.

> This includes looking for new sources, and developing local manufacturing capabilities.

> ""In peacetime, we had built up a stockpile of surgical and N95 masks. As we draw down on this stockpile, we will also need to replenish it with new supplies,"" said MND.

> ""In recent weeks, some places like Taiwan, Thailand and India have banned or tightened regulations on the export of masks. We are therefore strengthening the resilience of our supply chain, including looking for new sources, and developing local manufacturing capabilities.""

> Mr Gan had asked Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong about what lessons could be learnt from the COVID-19 outbreak, as well as what can be improved to better equip and prepare Singaporeans, including education in total defence against a pandemic outbreak.

> Mr Gan also asked if the Government will include production of masks and other medical protective gears as a strategic facility and support of the investment of such a facility in Singapore.

> MND referenced the various infectious disease outbreaks that Singapore has faced - SARS, H1N1, Zika and Monkeypox - and said that the lessons drawn from these past experiences had improved Singapore's readiness for the next outbreak.

> ""Over the years, we have strengthened our epidemiological surveillance and containment capabilities, and held regular emergency preparedness exercises to keep ourselves operationally ready,"" said MND, adding that the setting up of the National Centre for Infectious Diseases (NCID) has enhanced Singapore's infrastructure and capabilities to manage a disease outbreak.

> MND said it alerted all healthcare institutions and put in place precautionary measures according to its response plans when COVID-19 emerged.

> ""Even before Singapore had its first confirmed case, we anticipated that we would need a whole-of-Government effort to respond effectively to this threat and we set up the Multi-Ministry Taskforce on Jan 22, 2020 to coordinate our responses and measures,"" said MND.

> The Taskforce has since put in place a range of measures, from border controls to extra precautions within Singapore.

> MND said that it recognises that an important part of Singapore's defence system is also the role that each individual plays, and encouraged Singaporeans to not behave irrationally, selfishly or irresponsibly due to fear.

> The importance of not spreading unverified information or false news was also highlighted by MND, as this can cause panic and fear. It said that the Government has and will continue to push timely information through various platforms, so that Singaporeans can easily refer to authoritative sources for news, health advisories and the latest updates.

> ""We will continue to do everything we can, to keep Singaporeans safe, and to overcome this challenging situation together,"" said MND.

Mainichi Shimbun, February 18, 2020, 21:15 (Last Updated February 18 21:45)

Last summer, a large number of pearl oysters died in Mie and Ehime prefectures, which are major pearl producers. Many of the young pearl oysters are less than 1 year old, and there are fears that the decline of pearl production will worsen after 2021, when the pearls are supposed to be harvested.

Changes in the growth and development of pearl oysters occurred in July last year. In the first year, young oysters died in mass numbers. According to the Fisheries Agency, as of the end of September last year, only 10 to 50% of young oysters survived in the fisheries in Mie Prefecture, and 20 to 70% of the young oysters survived at fisheries in Ehime Prefecture compared to the average year.

*Trends in Domestic Pearl Production*

Since it takes more than 2 years for pearls to be harvested from pearl oysters, it is feared that the mass death of young pearl oysters will lead to a drastic decline in production after 2021. Ehime Prefecture has started emergency production of young oysters, but it is difficult to make up for the shortage. Farmers in Mie Prefecture usually procure many young oysters from Ehime Prefecture, but Mie Prefecture will start emergency production in February. ""Farmers' incomes may fall by half. In some cases, the company will be forced to suspend operations if it fails to secure young oysters,"" said Sadamu Yamagiwa, chairman of the Prefectural Pearl Aquaculture Liaison Council.

A survey conducted by the Mie Prefectural Fisheries Research Institute (Shima City, Mie Prefecture) in Ago Bay revealed that the seawater temperature was high between autumn 2018 and spring 2019, and that the phytoplankton that the oysters feed on were few.  A senior researcher at the institute said that undernutrition may have contributed to the mass die-off, but the exact reason for the die-off is not yet known.

In Ago Bay, the ""Hamaage"" harvest to extract pearls from the pearl oysters has been under way since last December, but farmers have expressed disappointment, saying, ""The shells are dead and the pearls cannot be taken."" Due to the aging population, the number of workers in the pearl oyster fisheries has been trending downwards.  ""If the mass die-off of oysters continues this summer, I'm worried whether or not I can keep up my spirits,"" said Hiroyasu Takebe, head of the Shimonada Fisheries Cooperative Association (Uwajima City, Ehime Prefecture).

On the other hand, Japanese pearls are popular in Hong Kong and Taiwan, and their exports are on the rise. But the outbreak of the new coronavirus in China delayed a large exhibition in Hong Kong from March to May. Demand is expected to decline due to widespread demonstrations in Hong Kong. A pearl distributor in Tokyo said, ""The exhibition is a place for business negotiations. The postponement will inevitably lead to a drop in sales, as exports are dependent on Hong Kong. The entire industry wants to overcome the crisis.""

*Pearl Cultivation*

Young pearl oysters are raised for about one and a half years to make mother shells, and then spherical nuclei, which are made from the shells of other shellfish, are implanted into their bodies. If placed in the sea for another six months to a year and a half, secretions form a layer around the nucleus to complete the pearl.

Pearls are produced not only in Mie Prefecture where they originated, but also in Ehime Prefecture, Nagasaki Prefecture and so on. Domestic production peaked at 125 tons in 1967. However, since the 1990s, annual production has decreased significantly due to a decrease in the number of aquaculture workers due to the aging population, and now has remained at around 20 tons per year.

Pearls are also popular in Hong Kong and other Asian countries, and ranks 2nd in the value of Japanese fishery product exports after scallops at 32.8 billion yen (2019). The government aims to increase exports of agricultural, forestry and fishery products, and pearls play a central role in its export strategy."

> SINGAPORE - Do not send employees to hospitals unless there is a medical emergency, the Ministry of Manpower (MOM) has warned employers, after hospitals reported that employers were dropping off workers to have them tested for the coronavirus.

> ""Employers who act irresponsibly by misusing medical facilities may have their work pass privileges suspended,"" it added.

> In a message sent to employers seen by The Straits Times on Wednesday (Feb 19), Mr Kevin Teoh, divisional director of MOM's foreign manpower management division, said the ministry had been getting feedback from hospitals that employers were sending their workers to be tested for Covid-19, as the disease is now known.

> ST has contacted the Health Ministry for more information on the extent of such behaviour.

> Mr Teoh reminded employers that hospitals will not test individuals who are well.

> ""This is to ensure that medical facilities and resources are focused on unwell individuals who need medical treatment,"" he said.

> A worker who is unwell should be sent to a general practitioner, who will then assess if the worker needs to be taken to hospital.

> ""Our hospitals are working hard to ensure that medical emergencies are handled promptly,"" said Mr Teoh.

> ""We encourage you to be socially responsible and only send workers to the hospital if it is a medical emergency, as doing so otherwise will deny immediate treatment to those who need it.""

> He added that employers should monitor the health of their workers by checking their temperature twice daily and reminding them to observe good personal hygiene, such as washing their hands with soap frequently.

Many Americans live paycheck to paycheck and do not have a lot in savings for rainy days, if there were to be martial law/people are not allowed to leave their house for work because of the coronavirus virus how will the Americans pay their rent and bills? How will they buy groceries? What will the government do? How long do you think martial law will last in the worst case scenario? 

2. There are people who take public transportation like the bus or the train to their job, so is there anything being done to ensure some kind of infectious disease prevention especially during rush hours? Maybe even doing something behind the scenes?

3. Could the virus still survive being in the water filter and still be in the tap water that we all use to wash our hands? What about the sewers? Could the cockroaches that came crawling from under the sink catch this virus and pass it on to us? What about rats and mosquito? 

4. Does laundry detergent and hot water from the washing machine kill the coronavirus on your clothes?

5. What if some people could not find any mask in stock in any store, is there something that you could make with any materials that can be found in any store that is just as sufficient for protection against the coronavirus as an n95 or even a surgical mask? 

6. Would you say that you have enough medicine and essential medical tools to treat a big cluster of infected people? I heard that 80% of the basic supplies needed to make them are shipped from china and that china is no longer shipping anything out right now due to coronavirus.

7. What defines ""recovered""? Does it mean that this virus is not contagious and detectable anymore after being discharged from the hospital? Do you still do follow ups with recovered patients? Does this virus somehow become dormant and hides inside your body somewhere like HIV or Herpes? 

8. Is the hospital bill going to be waived regardless of whether or not you are ensured? Will some people be in debt because of this pandemic? 

9. Is it a good idea to stay away from public restrooms because the flush could produce aerosols from an infected person who went before you? 

10. Would all US citizens be under mandatory quarantine for 14 days in a military base if they came from a country like Thailand that has not/refuses to banned or restricts any flights coming from China? 

11. Can a disposable n95 mask be reused during the pandemic if you sprayed lysol all over it and left it to dry for 9 days? 

12. How would you protect yourself if a family member is infected and you live in the same house as them?

13. How long does this coronavirus live in cloth? Packages? Steel? Cardboard boxes? Plastic? Atm Machines? Cash? Coins? Wood? Leather? In the air after someone infected has coughed? Can it still be present in dust? What about on food that is reheated on a microwave or a stove? Is it even still active after reheating? How long do you need to reheat it and under what temperature?"

China's daily number of newly recovered novel coronavirus patients has surpassed that of new confirmed infections for the first time, according to the National Health Commission.

Tuesday saw 1,824 people walk out of hospital after recovery, higher than the same day's number of new confirmed infections of the novel coronavirus, which was 1,749, showed figures from the commission Wednesday.

A total of 14,376 patients infected with the novel coronavirus had been discharged from hospital after recovery by the end of Tuesday.

The number of new confirmed cases in China outside Hubei, the epicenter province of the outbreak, has dropped for 15 straight days. A total of 56 new confirmed cases were reported Tuesday outside Hubei, sharply down from 890 on Feb. 3, according to the commission.

The commission said it received reports of 1,749 new confirmed cases on Tuesday from 31 provincial-level regions and the Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps, including 1,693 in Hubei.

China's daily new confirmed cases dropped to 1,886 on Monday, for the first time under 2,000 since Jan. 31.

1, A doctor’s general description of symptoms for the first three weeks of illness.

2. A day by day description of symptoms (from day 1 through day 12) and treatment for the first patient in the USA. He began feeling ill on Jan. 15, was admitted to the hospital on Jan. 20th, and was released from the hospital Feb. 3rd/4.


Item 1:
Symptoms explained by Doctor ihttps://www.straitstimes.com/asia/east-asia/reporters-notebook-life-and-death-in-a-wuhan-coronavirus-icu: 

“I've observed that the breakout period of the novel coronavirus tends to be three weeks, from the onset of symptoms to developing difficulties breathing. Basically going from mild to severe symptoms takes about a week. There are all sorts of mild symptoms: feebleness, shortness of breath, some people have fevers, some don't. Based on studies of our 138 cases, the most common symptoms in the first stage are fever (98.6 per cent of cases), feebleness (69.6 per cent), cough (59.4 per cent), muscle pains (34.8 per cent), difficulties breathing (31.2%), while less common symptoms include headaches, dizziness, stomach pain, diarrhea, nausea, vomiting.

But some patients who enter the second week will suddenly get worse. At this stage, people should go to the hospital. The elderly with underlying conditions may develop complications; some may need machine-assisted respiration. When the body's other organs start to fail, that's when it becomes severe, while those with strong immune systems see their symptoms decrease in severity at this stage and gradually recover. So the second week is what determines whether the illness becomes critical.

The third week determines whether critical illness leads to death. Some in critical condition who receive treatment can raise their level of lymphocytes, a type of white blood cell, and see an improvement in their immune systems, and have been brought back, so to speak. But those whose lymphocyte numbers continue to decline, those whose immune systems are destroyed in the end, experience multiple organ failure and die.

For most, the illness is over in two weeks, whereas for those for whom the illness becomes severe, if they can survive three weeks, they're good. Those that can't will die in three weeks.”


Item 2:

Symptom Progression Day 1 to Day 12 From
First Case of 2019 Novel Coronavirus in the United States 

35 year old male

https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2001191

On January 19, 2020, a 35-year-old man presented to an urgent care clinic in Snohomish County, Washington, with a 4-day history of cough and subjective fever. On checking into the clinic, the patient put on a mask in the waiting room. After waiting approximately 20 minutes, he was taken into an examination room and underwent evaluation by a provider. He disclosed that he had returned to Washington State on January 15 after traveling to visit family in Wuhan, China. The patient stated that he had seen a health alert from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) about the novel coronavirus outbreak in China and, because of his symptoms and recent travel, decided to see a health care provider....

Given the patient’s travel history, the local and state health departments were immediately notified. Together with the urgent care clinician, the Washington Department of Health notified the CDC Emergency Operations Center. Although the patient reported that he had not spent time at the Huanan seafood market and reported no known contact with ill persons during his travel to China, CDC staff concurred with the need to test the patient for 2019-nCoV on the basis of current CDC “persons under investigation” case definitions.8 Specimens were collected in accordance with CDC guidance and included serum and nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swab specimens. After specimen collection, the patient was discharged to home isolation with active monitoring by the local health department.
On January 20, 2020, the CDC confirmed that the patient’s nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabs tested positive for 2019-nCoV by real-time reverse-transcriptase–polymerase-chain-reaction (rRT-PCR) assay. In coordination with CDC subject-matter experts, state and local health officials, emergency medical services, and hospital leadership and staff, the patient was admitted to an airborne-isolation unit at Providence Regional Medical Center for clinical observation, with health care workers following CDC recommendations for contact, droplet, and airborne precautions with eye protection.

On admission, the patient reported persistent dry cough and a 2-day history of nausea and vomiting; he reported that he had no shortness of breath or chest pain. Vital signs were within normal ranges. On physical examination, the patient was found to have dry mucous membranes. The remainder of the examination was generally unremarkable. After admission, the patient received supportive care, including 2 liters of normal saline and ondansetron for nausea.


On days 2 through 5 of hospitalization (days 6 through 9 of illness), the patient’s vital signs remained largely stable, apart from the development of intermittent fevers accompanied by periods of tachycardia (Figure 2). The patient continued to report a nonproductive cough and appeared fatigued. On the afternoon of hospital day 2, the patient passed a loose bowel movement and reported abdominal discomfort. A second episode of loose stool was reported overnight; a sample of this stool was collected for rRT-PCR testing, along with additional respiratory specimens (nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal) and serum. The stool and both respiratory specimens later tested positive by rRT-PCR for 2019-nCoV, whereas the serum remained negative.

Treatment during this time was largely supportive. For symptom management, the patient received, as needed, antipyretic therapy consisting of 650 mg of acetaminophen every 4 hours and 600 mg of ibuprofen every 6 hours. He also received 600 mg of guaifenesin for his continued cough and approximately 6 liters of normal saline over the first 6 days of hospitalization.


A chest radiograph taken on hospital day 3 (illness day 7) was reported as showing no evidence of infiltrates or abnormalities (Figure 3). However, a second chest radiograph from the night of hospital day 5 (illness day 9) showed evidence of pneumonia in the lower lobe of the left lung (Figure 4). These radiographic findings coincided with a change in respiratory status starting on the evening of hospital day 5, when the patient’s oxygen saturation values as measured by pulse oximetry dropped to as low as 90% while he was breathing ambient air. On day 6, the patient was started on supplemental oxygen, delivered by nasal cannula at 2 liters per minute. Given the changing clinical presentation and concern about hospital-acquired pneumonia, treatment with vancomycin (a 1750-mg loading dose followed by 1 g administered intravenously every 8 hours) and cefepime (administered intravenously every 8 hours) was initiated.


On hospital day 6 (illness day 10), a fourth chest radiograph showed basilar streaky opacities in both lungs, a finding consistent with atypical pneumonia (Figure 5), and rales were noted in both lungs on auscultation. Given the radiographic findings, the decision to administer oxygen supplementation, the patient’s ongoing fevers, the persistent positive 2019-nCoV RNA at multiple sites, and published reports of the development of severe pneumonia3,4 at a period consistent with the development of radiographic pneumonia in this patient, clinicians pursued compassionate use of an investigational antiviral therapy. Treatment with intravenous remdesivir (a novel nucleotide analogue prodrug in development10,11) was initiated on the evening of day 7, and no adverse events were observed in association with the infusion. Vancomycin was discontinued on the evening of day 7, and cefepime was discontinued on the following day, after serial negative procalcitonin levels and negative nasal PCR testing for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus.

On hospital day 8 (illness day 12), the patient’s clinical condition improved. Supplemental oxygen was discontinued, and his oxygen saturation values improved to 94 to 96% while he was breathing ambient air. The previous bilateral lower-lobe rales were no longer present. His appetite improved, and he was asymptomatic aside from intermittent dry cough and rhinorrhea. 

As of January 30, 2020, the patient remains hospitalized. He is afebrile, and all symptoms have resolved with the exception of his cough, which is decreasing in severity.

But the way I see it, does it really matter what we think is going to happen?

Or is it more beneficial to prepare for the worst-case scenario, and act.

Imagine standing halfway up a snow-covered mountain and hearing a rumbling at the top.

Do you stand there and begin to discuss/analyze the statistical chance of it being an avalanche?

Or take action to protect yourself.

PLEASE, EVERYONE, do some basic preps: basic medical supplies and extra prescription medication, 1 month (or more) food, water, masks, vitamins, drinks, hand sanitizer (alcohol), bleach, disinfectant, toilet roll, women's sanitary supplies.

When you have all that, then relax a little and come back here and chat again.

Japan’s incompetent quarantining of thousands of passengers on a British cruise ship created a “coronavirus machine” that risks further spreading the disease, one of the country’s leading experts has said.

Kentaro Iwata, a professor of infectious disease, condemned the decision to release most of the passengers following two weeks of quarantine today because of the danger that infected people who are showing no symptoms of the disease will return to families and jobs unaware that they are passing on the contagion.

About 500 of the 3,100 people on board the Diamond Princess are being allowed off today, 14 days after it was quarantined. Professor Iwata says that a failure to follow basic infection control rules, and the unreliability of test results, mean that many of those released from quarantine could be carrying the disease.

Today the number of confirmed cases rose to 542. Dr Iwata appealed to the international community to put pressure on the government of Shinzo Abe to prevent further spread of the contagion, officially known as Covid-19. “I’m very concerned because you have no idea whether they have got the infection,” said Dr Iwata, a professor of infectious disease at Kobe University Hospital. “I wish all the international bodies [to] request Japan to change because otherwise there will be more infections.”

In an online video, headlined “The Diamond Princess is a Covid-19 manufacturing machine”, Professor Iwata described his horror on finding, during a visit to the ship yesterday, that officials in charge were failing to take the most basic precautions to prevent infection. He said that the situation in the port of Yokohama, one of Japan’s biggest cities, was “completely chaotic” and far worse than scenes he witnessed as a doctor working in parts of Africa stricken with the Ebola virus. After he urged the bureaucrats to improve the situation he was forced to leave the ship.

He said that there was no separation of “red” zones, which could be infected with the virus, from “green” areas, which are known to be safe. He observed a doctor treating people with fever who was talking no measures to prevent herself from infection. He saw people eating while wearing protective gloves, which could have been carrying the virus. Those in charge were bureaucrats without medical expertise, and there were no professional infection control experts on the ship.

“The cruise ship was completely inadequate in terms of infection control,” he said. “It was completely chaotic. I’ve dealt with lots of infections [over] more than 20 years. I never had a fear of getting infected myself – Ebola, Sars, cholera. In the Diamond Princess I was so scared of getting infected with Covid-19 because there was no way to tell where the virus was.” Dr Iwata will isolate himself from family and colleagues for two weeks. He said that there was a risk that doctors and nurses working on the ship would return to their hospitals and clinics and infect their patients. “I can’t bear it,” he said.

The Japanese health and welfare ministry has defended its decision to quarantine the ship and insists that most of the infections among passengers occurred before the period of isolation began. Japan’s health minister, Katsunobu Kato, said: “The National Institute of Infectious Diseases has indicated they can use public transportation as long as they were monitored for 14 days, tested negative to the virus and were confirmed to be in good health.”

But the new testimony appears to explain one of the mysteries of the ship – the infection of at least three quarantine officers or medical workers. The ministry says that they wore masks and sterilised their hands during and after interaction with patients. Dr Iwata’s description suggests that there were in fact many flaws in hygiene procedures which could have enabled infection.

The reaction of foreign governments suggests that they too lack confidence in Japan’s quarantine regime. The United States, Britain and Australia insist that citizens coming off the ship must either return on official evacuation flights and spend a further 14 days in quarantine or delay their return home until it is clear that they have not contracted the virus"

Just a few weeks ago some doctor that criticized the CPP for their lack of transparency about the Coronavirus disappeared. Young chinese that filmed what was going on in the hospitals disappeared too. They simply cannot criticized their governement. They are born, raise and work in a authoritarian governement that doesn't care of Moral, Virtues and Values. They don't have the choice. But do you Seriously think almost all of chinese are blind?

Here you have: ""Scientists Warn: You can catch coronavirus more than once. For those patients who have been cured, there is a likelihood of a relapse,"" Zhan Qingyuan, the director of pneumonia prevention and treatment at the China-Japan Friendship Hospital, said during a Friday press conference. “The antibody will be generated,” he added. “However, in certain individuals, the antibody cannot last that long.” Because some patients could get sick multiple times, it will prove even more difficult to track and contain the viral outbreak — which has already spread to and killed more people than did the entire SARS outbreak of the early 2000s.""

The death toll from China's coronavirus epidemic climbed to 1,868 on Tuesday morning as 98 more people died while the total number of confirmed cases jumped to 72,436.  
Of the new deaths, 93 were reported from Hubei Province, the epicentre of the virus, three from Henan, and one each from Hebei and Hunan.
Hubei reported 1,807 new confirmed cases, taking the total number of such cases to 59,989 in the province. Another 1,432 new suspected cases were reported from the rest of China.
A total of 358 people of 406 who were housed at an ITBP quarantine facility in Chhawla after being brought back from Wuhan have been released. All 406 have tested negative for novel Coronavirus in the latest sample examination and are being discharged in a phased manner . It is likely that all 406 will be released by Wednesday early morning from the ITBP Chhawla Centre. 
All released persons are advised to remain self isolated for the next 14 days at their respective places. They are also advised for do's and dont's during the period. 
Many of the people who were told that they would be allowed to go from the centre celebrated the moment with an impromptu dance and music show.
A total of 650 people were brought back from Wuhan in China on February 1 and 2 in two 747 Boeing Air India aircraft after the outbreak of the novel Coronavirus in China. While 406 of these are being looked after at the ITBP facility, rest are at an Army centre at Manesar in Haryana.

Gay-ops is code for illegal activities against others - actual crimes.

Straight-ops is code for playing it straight.  

Furthermore, don't compare us to half-chan, as that's where most of Homecoming's shills still regularly patrol and advertise.

Also, homophobic is a term, which is a misnomer.  Homophobic means scared of the same.  Furthermore, Homophobic is defined as:

It is used as calling something you disagree with or dislike as a label so you don't have to confront the concept that somebody disagrees with you or uses terminology that you dislike.  

Not saying a word or phrase does not make you an inherently good or better person.  It's just contribution to a group think and hive mentality of nobody should be offended ever.  The day you give anyone the power to control the speech of yourself or others, you have failed as a society and that means the person in control of your speech gets to control who hears you.  That's not good in any situation. Ever.  Look at how China is censoring news on the coronavirus, Winnie the Pooh, etc.  The second you advocate any censorship of language, you're right in bed with it, because you've set a line that can be moved and controlled.

Most of us stand for: ""I don't like what you have to say, but I will defend to the death your right to say it.""

For instance, World of Warcraft gave me a week ban for posting a video describing the problems with Corruption Gear and posting a video of one of their devs lying to our faces about how they never wanted RNG gear of lower level to drop and have better things than their higher piece, forcing them to downgrade.  They categorized it as trolling, when my message was saying that a dev lied to our faces.

Do you know why you defend all speech? Because when the first line falls, then the next, soon - you're at the front-lines and nobody's behind you. That's the issue."

See, the problem with a lot of these conspiracy sights is that their claims are easily falsified, and the writers aren't the most lucid of people. The reason why mainstream media is mainstream is because the members generally have a track record of reporting verifiable facts in a clear, lucid manner.

But since tangible evidence to you means ""occult symbols"", we're just going to have to approach this from a theoretical standpoint. 

Let's take Zerohedge's report that ""Coronavirus is a biological weapon"" and break it down. For a biological weapon to be good for military applications, it should be highly virulent, kill or incapacitate quickly, and not be transmissible between humans so as not to kill your own people. For this reason, weaponised anthrax was a popular idea for a while.

With novel coronavirus though you're looking at 6% fatality rate and rapid spread between humans (and a 14 day incubation period), with asymptomatic carriers reported. 

So it's neither 

1) guaranteed to kill or incapacitate quickly; or
2) guaranteed not to infect the user

Hmm. Either the weapon designers were very incompetent, or it's not a ""man made virus"" or whatever. 

Besides, what would the Chinese government have to gain from it? Chinese netizens are lit up demanding transparency and freedom of speech, they've poured millions into speed building field hospitals, and China's economy is hurting as a result."

They will be fertilized by the increased co2 in the air. (Yes.  Plants are fertilized through their leaves as well.)  The trees will grow. Trees are mostly made up of carbon, so will slowly absorb extra co2 over time.  

Co2 might arguably warming the planet, but it isn't just evil.  The world needs it.  There is a reason it existed in ancient swamps and animals that predate us.

The larger forests will isolate more rain in those areas. (Like the amazon does).

Lets not forget the glaciers possibly melting which shoulemd release more water to be absorbed into the atmosphere by the warmer earth which will eventually rain down somewhere, or freeze and fall to the ground as frost in colder areas.  


So some places are going to have a huge growth in forests, swamps, plant life... Etc.

So people are bad, yes?  Lets say thats true.  There is supposed to be a surge in tick, mosquito, and fleas from warmer weather as well.  So then lets look at coronavirus, zika virus, wastings disease, and a bunch of other stuff.  Well, those diseases are going to have more hungry carriers and more people are going to be 1. Outside longer to enjoy the warm weather and 2. Outside planting trees and gardens to try to stop climate change.

The problem will definitely sort itself out.  The earth has many layers of defense.  Nobody knows what will happen, generally, though.  Some say a new ice age is going to happen soon.  

If it worries you, just plant every plant that exists in your yard and introduce every disease, animal, and insect.  Eventually, after the dust settles, you will have a functioning ecosystem. 👍"

Also, if they were going to fake numbers for children, I daresay they would have made it older than 9 years. Sars didn’t have deaths under 12 years so it would be feasible to spin, if they wanted. Also, we know of 2 newborns who got the disease and are ok.

There’s very little to suggest that video was coronavirus related (actually nothing really, except that it’s when it came to people’s attention). And lots to suggest it isn’t."

Except the people who are dying are the same ones who are at risk from flu i.e older people or people who have health problems already. Hence if your younger you are probably gonna be OK, so far I think the amount of already healthy young people that have died from it is rather low.

Being less lethal than flu is both true and false since its stats and you can use stats in lots of ways, yes the mortality rate is higher but its at around 2% not the sort of rate the ""KILLER VIRUS"" headlines would have yo believe. 

Also it depends if your talking globally or country wide as well numbers. Since i think in the UK more people so far have likely died to flu than to coronavirus since we only have a very small amount of people infected with it, but if your takingly globally yeah maybe its higher... except flu kills between 250k and 650k a year and we are nowhere near that yet.

Hell the WHO basically say ""true rate cannot be figured out now"", some info here on there in the links on the page.

https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/coronavirus-death-rate/

So in TL;DR; its actually not factually incorrect on either statement, no numbers can be confirmed wither way on mortality and it is less of a worry if your younger."

Start with things like, how many people are infected in the country/area you reside? - most likely this number is low. If the number isn't what you would consider low, divide it by the total population in your area. Suddenly this number isn't so big and scary anymore. Also remember that COVID-19 is more likely to infect people 60+ that have underlying conditions. The best way to combat a fear like this is to justify and focus on all the ways in which you're protected rather than all the ways you're not. Just keep washing your hands (this is honestly so underrated as a defense against most viruses). You're going to be okay! <3"

Anyone else getting superstitious about tomorrow? 2/20/2020 seems like a perfect wikipedia article entry for a bear correction like Dec 2018. Perhaps 10% - 15% by 3/20? Seems like a healthy place to correct and even with a 10% drop we'd still have a decent margin above 3000. 

&#x200B;

""The S&P 500 began the day dipping to 3385 before a morning rally where the index topped out at 3400.00 before sliding through the close. The following Friday, the S&P 500, Nasdaq, and Dow Jones Industrial Average all closed 2% lower. The cause is generally accepted to be associated with fears surrounding global growth and coronavirus, though no one specific action can be pointed to as the beginning of the correction. The S&P 500 would find its bottom at 3065 in late March/Early April once fears associated with the virus subsided and sentiment returned to positive with the expectation of growth stabilizing."""

The Tiananmen Square protests or Tiananmen Square Incident, commonly known in mainland China as the June Fourth Incident (Chinese: 六四事件; pinyin: liùsì shìjiàn, literally six-four incident), were student-led demonstrations held in Tiananmen Square in Beijing during 1989. The popular national movement inspired by the Beijing protests is sometimes called the '89 Democracy Movement (Chinese: 八九民运; pinyin: bājiǔ mínyùn). The protests started on April 15 and were forcibly suppressed on June 4 when the government declared martial law and sent the military to occupy central parts of Beijing. In what became known as the Tiananmen Square Massacre (Chinese: 天安门大屠杀; pinyin: tiān'ānmén dà túshā), troops with assault rifles and tanks fired at the demonstrators and those trying to block the military's advance into Tiananmen Square.

Earlier, the World Health Organization (WHO) said it had no indications that the new coronavirus had spread to North Korea, after South Korean media suggested there were cases and deaths there that were being covered up by the Pyongyang authorities.
Han Tae Song, the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (DPRK) ambassador to U.N. organizations in Geneva, said its officials had extended the quarantine period to some 30 days - double the 14-day incubation period for the virus.

“(There has been) no case of the outbreak of coronavirus,” Han told Reuters. “We have a strict quarantine in certain areas for certain times.” Asked about suspect cases, he said: “The main suspects could be travelers who visited other countries - North Korean as well as foreigners.

“I was informed that we extended the quarantine, actually it was 14 days, but according to scientific results, coronavirus could break out even 3 weeks later. That is why we extended to 30 days quarantine...Prevention is less cost than cure.”

WHO spokesman Tarik Jasarevic said North Korea had reported checking nearly 7,300 travelers entering the reclusive country over a six-week period to Feb. 9. Citing the health ministry, he said 141 travelers with fevers had been tested for the virus but all had negative results.

“At the moment there are no signals, there are no indications we are dealing with any COVID-19 there,” Dr Mike Ryan, head of WHO’s emergencies program, told a news conference in Geneva on Tuesday."

&#x200B;

Speculative-grade, or subinvestment, debt makes up more than 60 per cent of the total to be repaid between now and 2024, “implying a higher degree of default risk for the industry”, said Moody’s, the rating agency, in a report on Wednesday.

&#x200B;

Speculative-grade maturities will peak in 2022, dwarfing investment-grade maturities by almost two to one that year, Moody’s said.

&#x200B;

But weakening oil and gas prices, and bearish market sentiment — caused by expectations of a global oil-supply overhang in the first half of 2020 — will hurt producers’ efforts to raise more money this year, in turn threatening to starve them of capital to invest in production to keep cash flow intact, said analysts.

&#x200B;

Companies already rated at subinvestment level and those focused on natural gas are especially exposed and will face investors that have developed a “risk aversion” to the sector, said the Moody’s report.

&#x200B;

Natural gas-focused Antero Resources, EQT and Chesapeake, which between them hold debt of more than $5bn due to mature between now and 2024, were among 12 companies Moody’s said would face a “particularly challenging” refinancing outlook.

&#x200B;

“While these companies have already taken some measures to address maturities, more needs to be done,” said Moody’s.

&#x200B;

In January, the average interest rate paid by shale producers for corporate debt rated by Moody’s as B3, or highly speculative, was 400-500 basis points above the average for B3 rated debt across all sectors, said Sajjad Alam, the lead author of the Moody’s report.

&#x200B;

Oil prices have fallen more than 15 per cent since early January, reflecting worries about global oversupply that have been exacerbated by the weakness of Chinese demand since the coronavirus outbreak. Meanwhile, front-month US natural gas prices plunged to their lowest February close in 20 years last week, amid unseasonably warm weather.

&#x200B;

But US shale producers are also victims of their own longer-term success. Natural gas output in the Lower 48 states of the contiguous US has almost doubled since 2005 and crude oil production has leapt almost 160 per cent since 2008.

&#x200B;

US natural gas production, which hit a record high in 2019, would rise by another 2 per cent this year, according to a forecast last week by the Energy Information Administration, a division of the Department of Energy. Crude oil production would increase almost 8 per cent, to 13.2m barrels a day, it said.

&#x200B;

That already represents a slowing of recent annual growth rates, but the looming credit crunch and increased cost of capital for indebted producers, alongside persistent weakness in oil and gas prices, could further damp production growth expectations, said analysts."

These are just quick results so they may not be the best sources. Looks like HEPA filters are meant to filter particles at .3 microns in size.  [HEPA info](https://https://www.cowaymega.com/what-is-a-hepa-filter/)  and [this site](https://smartairfilters.com/en/blog/can-air-purifiers-filter-out-the-coronavirus/) says HEPA filters can actually catch smaller particles by diffusion, though it is a site for selling air purifiers and the like.   [This NASA report](https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/20170005166.pdf)supports that though.  There are other non HEPA filters, typical A/C filters that have a [MERV rating](https://www.allfilters.com/airfilter/mervefficiency) high enough that they should work as well if you get a MERV 16 rated filter but they are pretty pricey and not all a/c units can handle the limited air flow. I think I'll try to find a regular HEPA filter that will fit my a/c unit and get another as a spare and potential donor of filter material for masks if we needed it.  Several of my family have really severe allergies and one has asthma so while they have small HEPA filters in their rooms, adding a HEPA filter for the a/c can only improve things and give us just a bit more of a safety net.

2020-02-19,axolotl_peyotl,conspiracy,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/f6c2oy/how_are_viruses_discovered_and_identified_in_the/fi3qi3t/,">The question I’ve been asking since 1987—If the experts are going to claim a particular virus causes a particular disease—how do they know that virus exists in the first place?

>For example, the supposedly new coronavirus in China. For example, Ebola. For example, HIV. For example, the coronavirus supposedly causing SARS (2003). How do researchers know these viruses exist?

>“Well, of course they know. They must.”

>That is not a satisfactory answer—even though most people would offer it.

>The question can become very interesting, when you stop and consider researchers working away in biowarfare labs fiddling with viruses. How do they know they’re tweaking viruses that actually exist?

>On a more mundane frontier, when scientists tell us they’re rushing to develop a vaccine against a virus that is harming the population, how do they know that virus exists to begin with?

>I came to this question when I was researching HIV in 1987. I began to think about it seriously in 1990. During all these years, I’ve reached out to independent researchers, and I’ve tried to stitch together their answers. I can’t say it’s been a smooth trip.

>But I have found some answers; and I have certainly found some fake mainstream assertions, which glitter like baubles on plastic branches of 99-cent store Xmas trees.

>Here are a few clues. You need to take a tissue sample from a live human being. You need to filter that sample correctly so you arrive at a much smaller sample you believe might contain a virus. You need to put a drop of that sample under an electron microscope and observe what looks like a virus.

>How much virus? How many identical particles of virus? Opinions differ on this. It could be one definite virus, one particle. It could be many, many identical particles.

>Sidebar: If you’re trying to prove this virus is actually causing DISEASE in a person, you have to go further. You have to show the very same virus is active and replicating at a very high rate in the person’s body, and his immune system isn’t defeating it. Beyond noticing the patient is sick, how do you test for all THAT? I’m still looking for a definitive technical answer—if there is one.

>All right, let’s’ get back to the electron microscope. Let’s say you’ve observed many identical particles of what looks like a virus in the electron microscope photograph, called an EM. You can then say, “Found it.” But you need to be sure. You need to figure out that this virus isn’t just something that ordinarily lives in the human body like a couch potato and does nothing—a passive endogenous virus. No. You want to show this virus comes from the outside as an invader—an exogenous virus. And how do you perfectly make that differentiation every time? Another question that might have no precise formula as an answer.

>Big question: CAN WE BE SURE ALL VIRUSES THAT ARE SAID TO EXIST AND SAID TO CAUSE EPIDEMICS ARE ACTUALLY FOUND AND OBSERVED AND IDENTIFIED ON ELECTRON MICROSCOPE PHOTOGRAPHS? CAN WE AT LEAST SAY THAT?

>No.

>In which case, the researchers have been, at least some of the time, up the creek without a paddle. They’ve jumped the gun. They’ve bolted out of the starting gate too soon. They’ve laid their money down on a horse that may not even be in the race. They’ve written a check no one can cash. They’re talking about lockdowns and quarantines without having proved their favorite virus of the moment exists. Sure, people on the back end will make big money from these unwarranted presumptions, but money is not science. It might control science, but it ISN’T science.

>All right. I’ve now set the stage for an excerpt from an interview, a profound interview with a late mainstream master who, in the face of fake science, suddenly was characterized as a rebel, Etienne De Harven. 

>The interview was conducted several years ago by the brilliant reporter, Celia Farber. You can find the whole interview [here](https://www.thetruthbarrier.com/2013/06/20/can-electron-microscopy-resolve-the-hiv-battle-an-exclusive-interview-with-em-pioneer-dr-etienne-de-harven/). 

>I strongly suggest you read it sixteen times. Yes, it gets technical. You’ll also notice names of elite scientists you haven’t run across. Learn the meaning of the words you’ve never seen before. Dig in. This isn’t television-type brush-off conversation. This isn’t a YouTube throwaway.

>I have another reason for exposing readers to this interview—it’s what a conversation about serious scientific issues looks like…this is what trying to bridge the gap between researchers, honest reporters, and the public looks like. There should be hundreds and thousands of such print-interviews taking place, laid before readers. They can handle it. Dumbing down people is partly an illusion: they can wake up. They WILL wake up if they’re sufficiently interested.

>Etienne De Harven’s background: president of the Electron Microscopy Society of America; researcher, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center; Cornell professor of cell biology; professor of pathology, University of Toronto; recognized pioneer in the field of electron microscopy.

>The interview focuses on HIV; whether it was ever found and isolated. The implications and questions spread out to any and all viruses."

Then, China said it would pay all bills related to the coronavirus. 

It’s going to be a mess if the virus gets a good foothold here. I know someone who said a student is in the infirmary at her school with 99.8 degree temp. The parent was called four hours ago but said she was too busy at work to get the kid. I doubt the parent would behave differently if it was Sars-Cov-2. 

I think another piece of this puzzle is community. A lot of folks don’t have much sense of community or responsibility now. A lot of people  don’t care if they or their kids make others sick:(

Another piece is some states have public schools that threaten parents if their kids miss more than three days total out of half a school year even with doctor’s notes. Parents are forced to send kids to school sick."

Some may let you if the government issues a avoid all non-essential travel warning after you buy the policy. It is also quite expensive about 5-10% of the cost of the trip.  Medical insurance is also very important. I recommend Tugo, it is very affordable. Also, they pay about quite easily if you need to make a claim."

Yes, these things must take place, but the end won’t follow immediately. Nation will go to war against nation, and kingdom against kingdom. There will be famines and earthquakes in many parts of the world.”
‭‭Matthew‬ ‭24:6-7‬ ‭NLT‬‬

“Then he added, “Nation will go to war against nation, and kingdom against kingdom. There will be great earthquakes, and there will be famines and plagues in many lands, and there will be terrifying things and great miraculous signs from heaven.”
‭‭Luke‬ ‭21:10-11‬ ‭NLT‬‬ 

Since the start of 2020, we have had WW3 scares (Soleimani’s death) Australia’s  fires, New Zealand’s volcano eruption, earthquakes in Madagascar, Turkey, Jamaica, Japan, floods in Brazil, Coronavirus in China, record setting locust plagues the size of Moscow, which are projected to reach India by June, and also causing massive famines in an already poor area.

>What about highly contagious diseases? Coronavirus? 

Has nothing to do with the kind of routine ambulance service op is talking about.

>What about the fact that even completely non-contagious illness/injury disrupts the life and productivity of not just you but also your family and acquaintances?

That's not a public safety concern.

>If we take this logic to the extreme, shouldn't we say the free-standing homes are not covered by emergency fire services, as there's no danger of the fire spreading? 

Not really true.  Fires jump house to house in suburban neighborhoods if left uncontrolled.

>No need to provide emergency fire service to rural areas anymore. 

City fire departments rarely extend to rural areas so that's already the case.  Most rural area rely on volunteer fire departments if they even have coverage.

>And by the same token, only virulent diseases need to be covered by medical care, whereas a broken leg does not?

No idea how this is ""by the same token""."

The issue has always been the volatility of royalties and there really isn't much that can be done about it. Alberta has reviewed royalties under conservative and NDP governments and always concluded they're as fairly optimal as possible. The NDP actually made them even more volatile at the last review by increasing the progressiveness of them.

Alberta's deficit is still projected to decrease so it's not actually dire news. Perhaps Kenney can cut back a little more in expenses then call it a day. He could potentially wait and do nothing for the time being."

Dr. Lorrin Pang, state Department of Health Maui District officer, said Tuesday that follow-up interviews by the Japanese government revealed that the 65-year-old man had “a cough, sore throat and stuffiness, but not a fever” while on Maui.

State officials had said Friday that the man, who stayed on Maui from Jan. 28 to Feb. 3, only showed cold-like symptoms during his time on Oahu from Feb. 3 to 7. However, Pang said that people sometimes have different definitions of symptoms, and it helps to continue asking.

“Since we’re looking in the hotels and the rental cars and their activities, we may as well just look since they arrived,” Pang said. “Maybe they were not sick and spreading it, but there’s always the chance that maybe they got it on Maui or Japan or the airlines coming over.”

Pang said he could not determine how many days the man had been symptomatic on Maui because he did not interview the patient firsthand. As it is, the department is relying on Japan’s ministry of health to follow up with the couple and relay the information to the state and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.However, Pang said that “it’s the conservative thing to act on it even though I don’t know how long.”

I hope the US and other countries  require a real quarantine of these passengers before coming back home.  I think they could possibly be exposed to this coronavirus anywhere on that ship and the  bus to the virus, even as they are leaving.   

 I think  that for every case  of outbreak since quarantine began and especially with the crew being  sick that any quarantine on the ship is flawed and those people just aren't turning up positive yet.   Please hope that the US quarantines them further."

I see multiple issues with this;

1. There's a law preventing food from being sold in a subway station (sanitary, food safety, vermin issues, etc)
2. You do need a permit for a ""food cart"" which multiple articles discussed that the cap for permits is under review to being abolished.

""Barcelona, ​​Feb 13 (EFE) .- The component manufacturer Magneti Marelli will present an Employment Regulation File (ERE) for its workforce of 400 people, due to the fact that the Chinese plant that supplies parts to manufacture its product is stopped by the coronavirus

As reported by CCOO, the management of Magneti Marelli de Barberà del Vallès yesterday informed the works council that next week it will present a temporary ERE for the entire workforce.

The Barberà del Vallès plant manufactures an electronic product with parts that are shipped from China and that come from a plant that the multinational has in the area near the focus of the coronavirus, which, at the moment, is closed.""

But if this new coronavirus resembles other human coronaviruses, such as its ""cousins"" that cause SARS and MERS, it can stay on surfaces —  such as metal, glass or plastic — for as long as nine days, according to a new study. (In comparison, flu viruses can last on surfaces for only about 48 hours.)

For example, disinfectants with 62-71% ethanol, 0.5% hydrogen peroxide or 0.1% sodium hypochlorite (bleach) can ""efficiently"" inactivate coronaviruses within a minute, according to the study. 

""We expect a similar effect against the 2019-nCoV,"" the researchers wrote, referring to the new coronavirus. But even though the new coronavirus is a similar strain to the SARS coronavirus, it's not clear if it will behave the same.It's also not clear how frequently hands become contaminated with coronaviruses after touching a sick patient or contaminated surface, according to the study. The World Health Organization recommends alcohol-based hand rubs for decontamination of the hands, the authors wrote.

It's possible that a person can be infected with the virus by touching a contaminated surface or object, ""then touching their own mouth, nose, or possibly their eyes,"" according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). ""But this is not thought to be the main way the virus spreads."""

""But, but, we are the good ones ..."", even if you think you are the good ones, other don't necessarily see it that way. 

I don't equate what the US does with what China or Russia do. For one thing, the former is more sophisticated and therefore more effective; while the latter use cruder and therefor less effective methods. 

""But, but, we have freedom of expression"". Yes we do, to a certain point at least. However, certain opinions about US imperialism or the legitimate interest of other powers to defend their own security, may not (yet) get you into prison, but they get you ostracized in most discussions, which is even more effective than prison.

The systematic mass observation and manipulation of the 5-eyes, the cultural hegemony of the Anglosphere, a vast industry of public and private intelligence firms (Cambridge Analytica, etc.) give the US/UK more power to influence in their own interest than any other country could possibly achieve. 

Don't get me wrong, I'm all in favor of bashing Chinese censorship (you may want to look into how China influences EU decision-making via small members like Portugal or Greece who are eager for Chinese investments), but there are two sides to every story.

I also think that the coronavirus mess could lead to a weakening of the CCP's rule, but I'm absolutely convinced that the US would make a complete mess if it tried its regime change routine on Beijing. The US has a terrible track record in this respect. The Chinese people need to sort this out without influence from abroad."

And finally, I’d buy a fleet of cloud seeding planes, and have them spread a mix of ebola, smallpox, and SARS coronavirus over a few busy metropolitan areas.

See, we all live with the expectation that tomorrow is going to be a lot like today, that all of our institutions and power structures will still be there tomorrow. So we rely on them. We pay into them. And we expect that they’ll scaffold our lives forever. But what happens when all of that is stripped away?

Imagine losing your job and your life savings, with no way to feed your kids tomorrow. Your government is in disarray, and there’s no stimulus package coming to save you anytime soon. And you can’t even leave your home, because people are dropping dead as an incredibly gruesome plague sweeps the land.

Those kinds of efforts could inadvertently result in accidents or deliberate misapplication of the results in ways that are harmful. It’s a careful balancing act, but I think those kinds of projects should undergo special review and a clear assessment of whether the benefit of that work is worth the risk.

**JAMA:**How prepared are the US government and our public health infrastructure to respond to biological threats?

**Dr Inglesby:**I think that our overall system of response in the US is strong, and it has been the subject of a lot of work and funding over the years. If you look at the late '90s or early 2000s, we didn't have a lot of hospital preparedness for infectious disease emergencies. There were people who were committed to it, but they weren't getting any funding for it. There weren't systems for it. There wasn't a lot of technical advice from the government. You go back to 2001, there was no acquisition system for new medicines and vaccines for pandemics or biological threats. We now have NIH programs, BARDA programs, CDC (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention), FDA (US Food and Drug Administration) programs, all oriented around trying to rapidly develop new medicines and vaccines when they're needed.  


We also didn't have stockpiles of medicines. We didn't have state health programs that were focused on emergency response that we now do. So there's a lot that's been built.

**JAMA:**What more needs to be done?

**Dr Inglesby:**We still have relatively few numbers of very high containment beds in the country. We have airborne isolation beds that take care of patients with TB (tuberculosis), but the training required to take care of a patient with Ebola is not the same as it is for TB. So there are still limits to what the system can do, despite the expertise, time, and money that's been spent on it. The initial funding that was given out to prepare a series of hospitals to take care of Ebola patients is about to expire, which is happening coincidentally at a time when we're about to have to deal with the coronavirus. So I think we need to keep that system going, or strengthen it, to be able to handle patients who are contagious.  


We need to make sure that our supply lines for things like masks and gowns are stronger and less dependent on interruptions from overseas. We also have pretty sharp limits for certain products in terms of surge manufacturing. We may have a vaccine that's been created and proven to be effective, but we have limited ways to make large quantities of it. So we have to invest more in surge manufacturing of products, medicines, vaccines, and diagnostics.  


It’s a story of good movement over the last 20 years but with limits and with moments where political leaders seem to forget the importance of it. And then moments where commitments are reenergized, when people see how dependent we are on preparedness systems.

**JAMA:**Is there anything that physicians and clinicians can do to prepare for biological risks in their communities?

**Dr Inglesby:**I think if possible, being familiar with unusual diseases. And the other thing would be to have knowledge and a relationship with the public health system wherever people are working. Many of these diseases need to be evaluated at a state health laboratory. Maybe it's as simple as knowing who in the hospital is responsible for that kind of thing. Those people should have a working relationship with state health departments so that the expertise and laboratory capacity of a state health department, or the CDC, can be brought in quickly when there's something that isn't right."

So your theory is that they were doing experiments with SARS viruses on animals in the super lab and in one virus accidentally jumped to a human which spread it to the general population?

So the scientific consensus is that there was live animals in the wet market and some strains mixed and enabled it to jump to humans and infected people at the wet market.

What exactly does the super lab part add to the theory?

As for locals saying they haven't seen bats at the wet market,

[https://www.ibtimes.sg/watch-this-woman-eating-bat-fancy-wuhan-restaurant-ignoring-uproar-over-natural-hosts-coronavirus-38197](https://www.ibtimes.sg/watch-this-woman-eating-bat-fancy-wuhan-restaurant-ignoring-uproar-over-natural-hosts-coronavirus-38197)

So, we know there were live animals in this market and we know that if you just mix a bunch of deadly viruses together in close proximity, then given enough time something like COVID-19 could pop up. Sure maybe it was more deliberately done in a super lab, but it could also just have happened randomly in a wet market.

This is where any scientist should be applying Occam's razor,

>""Entities should not be multiplied without necessity""  
>  
>For each accepted explanation of a phenomenon, there may be an extremely large, perhaps even incomprehensible, number of possible and more complex alternatives. Since one can always burden failing explanations with ad hoc hypotheses to prevent them from being falsified, simpler theories are preferable to more complex ones because they are more testable.

You don't need the super lab part, it's unnecessary and should be removed from the theory. Until the random zoonosis in a wet market theory fails to explain certain things, we shouldn't be adding more complexity to theory, it's just unnecessary."

In other words, we are just beginning stage and have not yet gotten to the Chinese stage yet. The most vulnerable will be those people who do not have access to good healthcare - people in poor countries in Africa, Asia, are all fucked. Since this virus punches holes into your organs like the lung and the liver, like swiss cheese, the infected people will need expensive intensive medical care for them to recover. But when you have a mass breakout of this disease, the medical system in any country, including your 'great healthcare system' will be quickly be overwhelmed if too many people become infected overnight.

Tờ Tài Tân (Caixin - 财新) số ra ngày thứ Tư 19 tháng Hai, cho biết cả gia đình một đạo diễn phim lừng danh của Trung Quốc đã chết hết. Tin buồn này cho thấy Bắc Kinh phạm quá nhiều sai lầm trong việc đối phó với dịch bệnh.  


Sai lầm thứ nhất là dịch bệnh cũng như hỏa hoạn, ta phải dập tắt nó ngay từ đầu. Trong khi đó, bọn cầm quyền không lo dập tắt dịch bệnh nhưng chú trọng vào công tác tuyên truyền và che đậy, đến khi đám cháy trở lên quá lớn, thì các nỗ lực dập tắt dịch bệnh trở nên vô cùng khó khăn, gây ra các hậu quả nghiêm trọng không những cho Trung Quốc, mà còn cho toàn thế giới.  


Sai lầm thứ hai là khi dịch bệnh bùng phát, các loại vật tư y tế trở nên đắt đỏ trên thị trường, tình trạng tham ô lập tức xảy ra tràn lan, khiến các bệnh viện không thể đáp ứng nhu cầu của các bệnh nhân, buộc họ phải tự cô lập ở nhà, trong điều kiện không có chữa trị gì cả, dẫn đến lây lay còn nhanh hơn trong các gia đình và lối xóm.  


Cái chết của cả bốn thành viên gia đình ở thành phố Vũ Hán, trung tâm của Hoa Lục, đã mất mạng vì coronavirus mới, trong khi tự cách ly trong cùng một căn hộ, đã một lần nữa đặt ra những câu hỏi nghiêm trọng về chính sách tự cách ly tại nhà khi dịch bệnh xảy ra.  


Trương Khải (Chang Kai - 张凯), một đạo diễn phim lừng danh của Trung Quốc làm việc tại hãng phim Hồ Bắc, đã chết vào ngày 14 tháng Hai do viêm phổi gây nên bởi coronavirus, còn được gọi là Covid-19, theo một cáo phó được công bố bởi giám đốc hãng phim. Đạo diễn Trương Khải mới 55 tuổi. Cha, mẹ và em gái của ông cũng chết vì Covid-19 trong khoảng thời gian từ 28 tháng Giêng đến 14 tháng Hai. Báo Tài Tân chúng tôi đã biết được chi tiết về cái chết đau lòng này từ những bạn học cũ của ông.  


Câu chuyện về cái chết của họ cho thấy một cách rõ ràng là các nhà chức trách ở thành phố Vũ Hán đã sai lầm nghiêm trọng như thế nào, khi từ đầu đã theo đuổi chính sách cách ly tại nhà, nhằm giảm bớt áp lực đối với các bệnh viện đang trong tình trạng quá tải, và thiếu thốn vật tư y tế.  


Chính sách đó đã được tiến hành bất chấp những lo ngại rằng nó có nguy cơ gây ra những hậu quả nghiêm trọng đối với sức khỏe cộng đồng. Trần Ba (Chen Bo - 陈波), giáo sư tại Đại học Khoa học và Công nghệ Hoa Trung (Huazhong - 华中) của Vũ Hán, nói với Tài Tân rằng việc tự cách ly tại nhà có thể châm ngòi cho việc lây nhiễm giữa các thành viên trong gia đình và cả trong cộng đồng, và gây ra nhiều ca tử vong bằng cách để mặc cho virus mặc sức tiến triển và hoàng hành nghiêm trọng mà không có điều trị gì cả.  


Một trong những bạn học cũ của Trương Khải nói với Tài Tân rằng cha của anh cảm thấy không khoẻ vào đúng ngày mùng Một Tết Canh Tý. Nhà đạo diễn đưa người cha lớn tuổi của mình đến khám ở một bệnh viện và được xác nhận là ông cụ đã nhiễm coronavirus. Tuy nhiên, bệnh viện yêu cầu đưa về nhà vì không có chỗ. Nhà đạo diễn, tin tưởng vào sự nổi tiếng của mình, đã đưa người cha đến một số bệnh viện khác ở Vũ Hán nhưng chỗ nào anh cũng bị từ chối vì thiếu giường. Nhiều người nằm la liệt cả ở ngoài hành lang. Không nỡ để cha nằm ngoài hè lạnh lẽo như thế, anh đưa ông về nhà. Ba ngày sau, ông cụ qua đời.  


Nhưng bi kịch gia đình anh chỉ mới bắt đầu. Vào ngày 2 tháng Hai, mẹ anh cũng chết vì cùng một căn bệnh.  


Cùng ngày mẹ anh chết, bác sĩ Chung Nam Sơn (Zhong Nanshan - 钟南山), một nhà dịch tễ học 83 tuổi, người nổi tiếng vì đã chiến đấu với dịch SARS năm 2003, cho biết trong một cuộc phỏng vấn trên truyền hình rằng thật là cực kỳ nguy hiểm khi các bệnh viện không đủ giường đã đuổi bệnh nhân về nhà bất kể họ đã được chẩn đoán là nhiễm coronavirus hoặc bị nghi ngờ nhiễm bệnh.  


Trường hợp của gia đình Trương Khải là một ví dụ điển hình. Trong thời gian chăm sóc cho song thân, anh nhiễm bệnh và qua đời vào ngày 14 tháng Hai. Chỉ vài giờ sau đó, em gái anh cũng đã ngã gục trong trận chiến với virus. Vợ anh, cũng mắc bệnh, đang trong tình trạng nghiêm trọng.  


Một trong những bạn học cũ của Trương Khải đã đưa cho Tài Tân một bài thơ được viết bởi nhà làm phim về chính cái chết của mình. Được viết bằng tiếng Hoa cổ điển đầy thơ mộng, bài thơ dài kết thúc với những câu: Trước khi trút hơi thở yếu ớt cuối cùng, tôi muốn nói với gia đình, bạn bè và con trai tôi ở London xa xôi: Cả đời tôi, tôi là một người con hiếu thảo, một người cha có trách nhiệm, yêu thương vợ mình, và là một người trung thực! Xin chia tay những người tôi yêu mến và những người yêu thương tôi!

“It’s highly possible to get infected a second time,” one of the doctors, who declined to be identified, told the outlet.

The physician said that medication used to treat the virus can have negative side effects on patients’ heart tissue, making them more susceptible to cardiac arrest.

*“A few people recovered from the first time by their own immune system, but the meds [sic] they use are damaging their heart tissue, and when they get it the second time, the antibody doesn’t help but makes it worse, and they die a sudden death from heart failure,” the doctor said.*"

The issue isn't it being in Boston, it's the fact that there will be nearly 100,000 people from all over the world attending and Sony would have to send employees fromall around the world to be there where they will have to interact with 100,000 strangers in a convention center.

Note my point: ""Moreso when one recalls that Sony attended E3 2002/2003 during the SARS pandemic. What, is Boston a much greater risk than LA? Nonsense.""

E3 has people from all over the world too and attendees at the time ranged in the 60+K numbers. Again, this isn't persuasive.

> If Sony didn't want to go to PAX they wouldn't have said they would be there and then make up an excuse a week before it started. Nothing at PAX was going to be related to their future plans anyway. They weren't going to release new information at PAX.

You sure know a lot about Sony's plans.

But again, the point I made above.

I pointed out that Sony has no problems dropping out of events and withholding information if they wanted to, so if they wanted to drop out, they would have done so and simply said they want to wait for a better time or any other excuse they want. They didn't really need to use the coronavirus as an excuse."

The case fatality rate (CFR) represents the proportion of cases who eventually die from a disease.

**Once an epidemic has ended**, it is calculated with the formula: **deaths / cases**.

But **while an epidemic is still ongoing**, as it is the case with the current novel coronavirus outbreak, **this formula is, at the very least, ""naïve""**  and can be ""**misleading** if, at the time of analysis, the outcome is unknown for a non negligible proportion of patients."" \[[8](https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/coronavirus-death-rate/#ref-8)\]

([Methods for Estimating the Case Fatality Ratio for a Novel, Emerging Infectious Disease](https://academic.oup.com/aje/article/162/5/479/82647) \- Ghani et al, American Journal of Epidemiology).   
 

In other words, **current deaths belong to a total case figure of the past, not to the current case figure** in which the outcome (recovery or death) of a proportion (the most recent cases) hasn't yet been determined.

The correct formula, therefore, would appear to be:

**CFR = deaths at day.x / cases at day.x-{T}**  
 *(where T = average time period from case confirmation to death)*

This would constitute a fair attempt to use values for **cases and deaths belonging to the same group of patients**.

One  issue can be that of determining whether there is enough data to  estimate T with any precision, but it is certainly not T = 0 (what is  implicitly used when applying the formula current deaths / current cases  to determine CFR during an ongoing outbreak). 

Let's take, for example, the data at the end of February 8, 2020: **813 deaths** (cumulative total) and **37,552 cases** (cumulative total) worldwide. 

If we use the formula (deaths / cases) we get:

813 / 37,552 = 2.2% CFR (flawed formula).

With  a conservative estimate of T = 7 days as the average period from case  confirmation to death, we would correct the above formula by using  February 1 cumulative cases, which were 14,381, in the denominator:

**Feb. 8 deaths** / **Feb. 1 cases** = 813 / 14,381 = **5.7% CFR** (correct formula, and estimating T=7).

T  could be estimated by simply looking at the value of (current total  deaths + current total recovered) and pair it with a case total in the  past that has the same value. For the above formula, the matching dates  would be January 26/27, providing an estimate for T of 12 to 13 days.  This method of estimating T uses the same logic of the following method,  and therefore will yield the same result. 

An alternative method, which has the advantage of not having to estimate a variable, and that is mentioned in the [American Journal of Epidemiology study](https://academic.oup.com/aje/article/162/5/479/82647)  cited previously as a simple method that nevertheless could work  reasonably well if the hazards of death and recovery at any time *t* measured from admission to the hospital, conditional on an event occurring at time *t*, are proportional, would be to use the formula:

**CFR = deaths / (deaths + recovered)**

which, with [the latest data available](https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/), would be equal to:

**2,122 / (2,122 + 15,893) = 12% CFR (worldwide)**

* ""***More than 80% of patients have mild disease and will recover***. In about 14% of cases, the virus causes severe diseases including pneumonia and shortness of breath. And about 5% of patients have critical diseases including respiratory failure, septic shock and multiorgan failure,"" ***""In 2% of reported cases, the virus is fatal***, and the risk of death increases the older you are."" - ***Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, director-general of the World Health Organization***

That's quite a small risk to the average under 50 healthy person.

⦁	Neil Ferguson, professor of mathematical biology at Imperial College London said he believes ***the fatality rate is likely to be lower because of an ""iceberg"" of milder cases.***

Most people recover without having to receive treatment, passing it off as just an average cold or flu. So the coronavirus may actually have a *less* than 2% fatality rate.

⦁	Chinese health officials are optimistic as the number of new cases of COVID-19 has **tentatively** ***stabilized***. Health experts think the disease could be ***less deadly, with many people only showing mild symptoms.***

Cases are beginning to *slow* currently, of course only time can tell if this is the peak of the virus, but we can be hopeful.

* An eight-month old baby in the UK that had 'direct and significant' contact with an infected doctor was ***cleared of the virus.***

As it's known, *children have very weak immune systems*, this baby managed to *avoid* becoming infected despite having direct contact with a doctor who was infected, showing that it may not actually be that easy to catch the coronavirus as you would with a simple cold.

I hope these help you as they did with me, friend. Coronavirus shouldn't be a huge worry to those not in the epicentre/in developed countries.

*You will be okay.*

Just practice good hygiene and don't listen to those silly fear mongering articles or crazy conspiracy nuts. I understand how hard it is to do that, of course. Best of luck with your anxiety."

We are already seeing immediate economic consequences as a result of the protests, but for the mid-term we may seen even worse economic stress as a result of the disruption in global supply chains due to the Coronavirus outbreak. Any Canadian company dependant on Chinese imports or exports will be hit if China continues to remain in a state of partial lockdown. Larger corporations are already seeing an economic hit looming in the horizon as sales in China have plummeted, or they can no longer access Chinese labour and have had their supply chains stalled. These protests could not have come at a worse time. If both these economic disruptions continue, Canada's economy may be hit quite hard, an unholy one-two punch. A low overnight interest rate, an overinflated housing market, an irreplaceable critical rail and road infrastructure, and a large depencance on global markets would leave Canada in a vulnerable position if faced with an economic downturn."

They might even pull out a knife to get the motherfucking point across If that is what it takes do you understand? Why? Because they have learned that playing the white man’s game is playing a rigged game. They have played that game, look where it got them. So they play their own game. You fuck on black people? They fuck on you, 6425 times harder. It doesn’t matter if they’re not being civil about it it. Because racism is not civil you see. Racism is evil and we don’t negotiate with evil. We eradicate it from the face of the planet.

Asians are a diaspora. Asians have not learned that playing the white man’s game is playing a rigged game. Asians believe that living modestly and quietly will bring us happiness. Asians pride themselves in being emotionally stable and not being an inconvenience to people. We don’t want to cause trouble. We live in our enclaves. Silently.

Racism towards Asians is very covert. It’s hard to be taken seriously when the racism you experience is so unique. Fuck I think some of you white fucks are shaking their heads reading this shit right now because your head is so far up your ass that you can’t take other people’s experiences seriously.

It really doesn't. At least not in the ways OP and likely some others probably imagined.

> why do you want to punish it?

I've not punished anything. Looks more like the devious mole did that to themselves. That's usually how it works; users are their own worst enemies in these things.

> The idea of public mod logs is to bring more transparency to mod actions.

Yes, in theory. And it's all a nice thought. I'm not even wholly opposed to it. But I do recognize that public modlogs often open up a box containing more problems than what subs had from the outset without it. Would you like examples? I've got plenty. It also should be considered why reddit themselves haven't rolled out that ability across all subs. They have the framework available already, it's just been tucked away for years. Which is good, IMO, because the bad outweighs the benefit.

> For all we know, you leaked this conversation yourself in order to further discredit mods of coronavirus

Purpose being? Haha. Fella, if you knew what kind of information I held, and the length of time I've kept it under wraps, you'd feel real silly about that suggestion. I've nothing to gain by disrupting those subreddits. Only so much as to help ensure *some* group of folks on this site are responsibly trying to manage the deluge of information on a serious global health situation. That's pretty much it. And they're doing a great job of it, all things considered. Lastly, how on earth would I leak old material I wasn't privy to until just yesterday? 

> That seems to be the agenda of the ""anti-mainstream-coronavirus"" subs.

You don't seem to have your radar properly tuned as to which agendas are where--or if anywhere, at all.

> At best, your interaction here is childish and likely to provoke people rather than calm them down

I'm not a guidance counselor, counselor.
 
> seem to start fires not put them out.

China’s Centre for Disease Control and Prevention has released the largest study yet of patients confirmed to be carrying the coronavirus.

The data from around 44,000 patients – from December 8 when the first cases emerged in Wuhan, Hubei province, up to February 11 – sheds important new light on the disease, showing who is most affected, how serious it is and how it has progressed over time. 

Here, we examine the data to find out what it can tell us about the new coronavirus. 

Who is getting the disease?

Previous, smaller-scale studies have shown that older people are more likely to get the disease but younger poeple are not immune. Nearly 15,000 of those infected were aged 30 to 49 (36 per cent of the total).

The good news is that children and teenagers are not badly affected by the disease – just two per cent of those who contracted the virus (just under 1,000 children and young people) were aged 0 to 19.

Men are also more likely to get the disease than women – 51.4 per cent of those who contracted Covid-19 were men. While this is not a huge difference the disease appears to be more serious in men than women.
How serious is the coronavirus?

The study categorises cases as either mild, severe or critical. Mild cases included patients either without pneumonia or with only mild pneumonia. Severe cases include patients whose symptoms include shortness of breath and rapid breathing. Critical cases were those who had respiratory failure, septic shock and/or multiple organ failure.

The figures show what many experts have been saying – 80 per cent of cases are mild, nearly 14 per cent are severe and nearly five per cent are critical. However, some people may wonder whether contracting pneumonia and being hospitalised constitutes a mild case.

The study does not break down disease severity information into age profiles, however it is probable that older patients would have the most severe form of the disease as this would fit with death rates. 

Greg Gray, professor of infectious diseases at Duke University, said it was “reassuring” to see a high percentage of mild infections.

But he added that the case definition for Covid-19 has changed and testing has not always been available throughout the epidemic. 

“Some mild infections and some severe infections and deaths from Covid-19 were likely missed. It will be good to see if the high prevalence of mild infections and low mortality rates remain stable as more patients are studied,” he said.

How deadly is the disease?

Out of the 44,000 confirmed cases 1,023 people have died, showing a death rate of 2.3 per cent.

This is higher than for other respiratory illness pandemics – H1N1 or swine flu raced around the world in 2009 and is thought to have infected around a fifth of the global population. However, the death rate was around 0.02 per cent.

Many experts believe that the overall death rate for Covid-19 will turn out to be much lower as people with very mild infections have still not been counted in the case numbers. Mathematical modellers at Imperial College, London believe that only one in 10 cases of the disease are being recorded in China.

But when you examine the data more closely interesting patterns emerge. First the death rate is higher in Hubei province than in the rest of China – 2.9 per cent compared to 0.4 per cent. This might be down to the fact that the health system in the province has struggled to cope with the high number of cases.

""Lessons being learned in Wuhan are being applied elsewhere so this could explain the lower death rate outside Hubei,"" said WHO's director of emergencies Dr Mike Ryan. 

Secondly, as would be expected, the death rate is higher among older people. For those aged 80 or over it is 14.8 per cent. These numbers fall quite quite rapidly as the age groups go down.

Men are also more likely to die from the disease – 63 per cent of all the deaths have been in men. The study does not discuss why this is although some experts believe that high smoking rates among men in China – around 52 per cent – could be one reason for the disparity.

Another interesting statistic is how the death rate has fallen as the outbreak has progressed. For those who contracted the coronavirus before December 31 – when the first official notification of this new disease was made – the death rate was 14.4 per cent. It then went up to 15.6 per cent for those who became ill between January 1 and and 10 but then fell away quite rapidly to 0.8 per cent for those who contracted the disease after February 1.
However, there is a huge caveat to this statistic. The figures only go up to February 11 so would not capture anyone who died after this date. The first European fatality, a Chinese tourist, was admitted to hospital in France on January 25 and his death was announced on February 15 – so there can be a significant time lag between disease onset and death. 

And only the most severe cases were being found at the beginning of the epidemic so there was a ""huge bias"" towards the most severe cases, says Dr Ryan from the WHO.

At the beginning of the swine flu epidemic the case fatality rate was around 20 per cent before plummeting once all the mild cases had been found.

He added that health staff in Wuhan were also refining their practices, for example by prioritising patients with underlying disease.

""The falling fatality rate is a mixture of having better and better interventions and finding more mild cases,"" he said. 

What about health workers?

The study looks at the heavy toll the outbreak has taken on health workers – 1,700 have been diagnosed with the disease and five have died. It says no ‘super-spreading’ events have taken place in hospitals – that is where a single individual disproportionately infects many others – but does not clarify what it means by this. Super spreadingevents have been a feature of other coronavirus outbreaks.

But it also shows that fewer health workers are now being infected – this may be because infection control policies have been tightened up.

Are the number of cases still growing?

Over the last week or so the WHO has said that the number of daily cases seems to be stabilising but it has warned repeatedly that the outbreak could go in any direction. This study shows that the number of new diagnoses peaked around February 2 when there were around 3,500 new diagnoses, compared to 2,500 on February 11.  

The paper puts the fall down to China’s aggressive containment policies – but it is worth remembering that the CDC is a government agency. The report states: “Isolation of whole cities, broadcast of critical information… with high frequency through multiple channels and mobilisation of multi-sector rapid response teams is helping to curb the epidemic.”

However, it also warns that the disease could “rebound”. WHO director general Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus also urged caution when presenting the figures.

“This trend must be interpreted very cautiously. Trends can change as new populations are affected. It’s too early to tell if this reported decline will continue. Every scenario is still on the table,” he said.

Prof Gray agreed.

“As China resumes normal work and school activities ... one would anticipate that Covid-19 infections will likely increase, at least initially and eventually plateau. My concern is what will happen with the world case count if the virus becomes entrenched in other countries with large cities with dense human populations.”

Does the study shed more light on where the disease emerged?

The study says that the epidemic curve – that is, the trajectory of the outbreak – is consistent with the theory that Covid-19 began in the Huanan seafood wholesale market. There were a few cases from the same source at the beginning but then, as the disease started to spread in the human population, there were multiple new sources of infection later. But it still cannot point to the animal which first spread the disease. "

This is related to how they evangelize. They infiltrate into normal churches as believers for ten or twenty years ago, building trust. After years of infiltration, they estrange members of the church, causing disorder and take the members into their cult, ruining the church.

Normal churches are very hostile against shincheonji cult. If they get investigated about coronavirus, people will find out that they aren't real believers but actually are cultists so banish them from churches. Head of the cult doesn't want their long plans to fail so they are telling the cultists to hide - which is causing potentially billions of dollars of damage to national economy in long term."

This is false. Current estimates put coronavirus' mortality rate at around 50-60x that of influenza, and its basic reproductive rate (how contagious it is) at about 2.5x.

By the raw numbers coronavirus isn't currently a huge risk, but its characteristics suggest that it has the potential to become one if it isn't handled carefully."

Many here have speculated that the ARDS trial in Japan  will finish earlier than stroke.  His unambiguous statement certainly indicates that they are enrolling ARDS ahead of schedule. An update to the timeline should be expected and it just may be an abrupt press release that enrollment has been completed. Remember he gave a 1 year cushion on stroke that was eaten up by manufacturing issues. I always believed he also gave a large cushion on ARDS enrollment in case something similar went wrong.  It sure seems that those manufacturing problems are now in the rear view mirror with regard to supplying both Japan trials. Certainly, the fear of a corona virus  in Japan has made this trial very high profile in Japan.  Approval would be a boon to Shinzo Abe and the program he put in place to promote regenerative medicine. There are politics at play here that also helps.

Just yesterday the 51 year old director of the Health system in the Wuhan province succumbed to the corona virus despite herculean efforts to save him.

Confirmation bias is the tendency to search for, interpret, favor, and recall information in a way that confirms or strengthens one's prior personal beliefs or hypotheses. It is a type of cognitive bias. People display this bias when they gather or remember information selectively, or when they interpret it in a biased way. The effect is stronger for desired outcomes, for emotionally charged issues, and for deeply-entrenched beliefs.

Like I said, business spends billions do cost to risk analysis to keep employees safe and the coronavirus is barely even seen as a factor other than increased travel costs due to rerouting out of China. It makes a fun news story and it's a good political tool, but these things are largely overblown. 

Remember when people were saying we should shut down all airports because of the ebola outbreak? Yeah that didn't go anywhere and closing the airports likely would have impacted more people negatively health wise (plenty of flights are needed for medical reasons everyday) than the ZERO people who died from ebola in developed countries."

It's a category of viruses that COVID/Wuhan Flu happens to be in. Plus a lot of over-reporting on deaths(while ignoring articles about prevention or people who recover or only get a mild case) led to... well, a lot of panic, due to similar psychological responses to hearing about airplane crashes. Logically, the risk of death isn't crazy high, but human minds are really bad at judging things they haven't experienced, especially when the most recent interaction has been hearing about it causing death and destruction(likewise, more common but still dangerous things can end up seeming overly commonplace, to the point that people round down the risk to nil... even though the common flu does still have some level of risk to it, for example)."

Further, both the Lancet and Imperial College London's reports state that China is *way* under counting cases. The Lancet's estimation worked out roughly to be one order of magnitude. If you take that and use the low end CFR of 2% well, the math looks bad. Especially when one considers that the medical system is totally overwhelmed and many are dying at home, and not being reported as COVID cases (see: the case of the Japanese national whose death was originally labeled as ""pnumonia"" until his family complained and a test was run showing him to be positive for SARS-CoV-2.

HONG KONG — China on Wednesday said it would revoke the press credentials of three Wall Street Journal reporters working in mainland China, in a significant escalation of Beijing’s pressure on the foreign news media.

At a daily news briefing on Wednesday, a spokesman for China’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs said the credentials would be revoked in retaliation for a headline for an essay that ran in The Journal’s editorial pages earlier this month. The headline read, [“China Is the Real Sick Man of Asia.”](https://www.wsj.com/articles/china-is-the-real-sick-man-of-asia-11580773677)

Chinese officials have “demanded that The Wall Street Journal recognize the seriousness of the error, openly and formally apologize, and investigate and punish those responsible, while retaining the need to take further measures against the newspaper,” Geng Shuang, the ministry spokesman, said in a transcript provided by the Chinese government.

“The Chinese people do not welcome media that publish racist statements and smear China with malicious attacks,” he added.

The Journal [identified the reporters](https://www.wsj.com/articles/china-expels-three-wall-street-journal-reporters-11582100355) as Josh Chin, its deputy bureau chief in Beijing and an American national; Chao Deng, an American; and Philip Wen, an Australian national.

A spokesman for Dow Jones & Company, publisher of The Journal, did not have an immediate comment.

Like other media organizations, including The New York Times, The Journal runs its news and editorial departments as separate operations, meaning none of the newspaper’s reporters in China would have been involved in writing the essay’s headline.

The move comes just months after Chinese officials[ effectively expelled another Journal reporter](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/30/business/china-wall-street-journal-reporter.html), Chun Han Wong, from mainland China. Officials did not provide a reason, but the expulsion came after he co-wrote an article about a cousin of China’s top leader, Xi Jinping.

It also comes less than one day after American officials in Washington said [they would treat five government-controlled Chinese news organizations](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/18/world/asia/china-media-trump.html?searchResultPosition=6) — Xinhua, CGTN, China Radio, China Daily and People’s Daily — as foreign government functionaries, subject to similar rules as diplomats stationed in the United States.

Also, bioweapons do not need to be lethal if you don’t want to kill many people. You can send fear to a country or place. Like the Mongols, they would send dead people infected with diseases over city walls so that city could surrender.

[So here's a story from yesterday](https://www.latimes.com/science/story/2020-02-18/report-shows-limits-of-coronavirus-screening). 

In short? The US government took known possible infected persons and threw them into quarantine together because no symptoms, no tests. (We are also allowing people who fly in to LAX from outside the country to refuse tests, why, and are you okay with this policy?) 

Our current procedure isn't working, but since you decided to harp on the idea that maybe we shouldn't be doing tests on a large scale? 

[The CDC is rolling out five labs across the country](https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/5-u-s-cities-start-testing-patients-flu-symptoms-coronavirus-n1136941). 

They will be performing way MORE than 10,000 tests, just weeks after they should have gotten started, and for some reason, are not performing these tests are major airports already.

So you tell me, between those two articles, now that we've both read them all, do you think the US policy is working, or the South Korean is working? 

Because the US is ABOUT to test, but just in five large cities. Does that make more sense to you than them testing in our major travel hubs? Why, if so?"

2. The cold is not ""coronavirus"", in the sense of being Covid 19. They are both examples of coronavirus. But comparing them is as daft as comparing  malaria to salmonella - they are both bacteria after all.
3. It absolutely is a new disease. Coronavirus is not a virus - it is a family of viruses with shared traits. Covid 19 is one of those viruses, and it is a new virus.

The person at your work who thought it killed everyone it infected didn't get that from the news - they got that from their fevered imagination. Misinformation or misunderstandings in one direction are not fixed by providing misinformation in the other direction.

While Chinese authorities struggle to control the epidemic and restart their economy, a world that has grown accustomed to contemplating China’s inexorable rise was reminded that nothing, not even Beijing’s power, can be taken for granted.

We do not know how dangerous the new coronavirus will be. There are signs that Chinese authorities are still trying to conceal the true scale of the problem, but at this point the virus appears to be more contagious but considerably less deadly than the pathogens behind diseases such as Ebola or SARS—though some experts say SARS and coronavirus are about equally contagious.

China’s initial response to the crisis was less than impressive. The Wuhan government was secretive and self-serving; national authorities responded vigorously but, it currently appears, ineffectively. China’s cities and factories are shutting down; the virus continues to spread. We can hope that authorities succeed in containing the epidemic and treating its victims, but the performance to date has shaken confidence in the Chinese Communist Party at home and abroad. Complaints in Beijing about the U.S. refusing entry to noncitizens who recently spent time in China cannot hide the reality that the decisions that allowed the epidemic to spread as far and as fast as it did were all made in Wuhan and Beijing.

The likeliest economic consequence of the coronavirus epidemic, forecasters expect, will be a short and sharp fall in Chinese economic growth rates during the first quarter, recovering as the disease fades. The most important longer-term outcome would appear to be a strengthening of a trend for global companies to “de-Sinicize” their supply chains. Add the continuing public health worries to the threat of new trade wars, and supply-chain diversification begins to look prudent.

Events like the coronavirus epidemic, and its predecessors—such as SARS, Ebola and MERS—test our systems and force us to think about the unthinkable. If there were a disease as deadly as Ebola and as fast-spreading as coronavirus, how should the U.S. respond? What national and international systems need to be in place to minimize the chance of catastrophe on this scale?

Epidemics also lead us to think about geopolitical and economic hypotheticals. We have seen financial markets shudder and commodity prices fall in the face of what hopefully will be a short-lived disturbance in China’s economic growth. What would happen if—perhaps in response to an epidemic, but more likely following a massive financial collapse—China’s economy were to suffer a long period of even slower growth? What would be the impact of such developments on China’s political stability, on its attitude toward the rest of the world, and to the global balance of power?

China’s financial markets are probably more dangerous in the long run than China’s wildlife markets. Given the accumulated costs of decades of state-driven lending, massive malfeasance by local officials in cahoots with local banks, a towering property bubble, and vast industrial overcapacity, China is as ripe as a country can be for a massive economic correction. Even a small initial shock could lead to a massive bonfire of the vanities as all the false values, inflated expectations and misallocated assets implode. If that comes, it is far from clear that China’s regulators and decision makers have the technical skills or the political authority to minimize the damage—especially since that would involve enormous losses to the wealth of the politically connected.

We cannot know when or even if a catastrophe of this scale will take place, but students of geopolitics and international affairs—not to mention business leaders and investors—need to bear in mind that China’s power, impressive as it is, remains brittle. A deadlier virus or a financial-market contagion could transform China’s economic and political outlook at any time.

Many now fear the coronavirus will become a global pandemic. The consequences of a Chinese economic meltdown would travel with the same sweeping inexorability. Commodity prices around the world would slump, supply chains would break down, and few financial institutions anywhere could escape the knock-on consequences. Recovery in China and elsewhere could be slow, and the social and political effects could be dramatic.

If Beijing’s geopolitical footprint shrank as a result, the global consequences might also be surprising. Some would expect a return of unipolarity if the only possible great-power rival to the U.S. were to withdraw from the game. Yet in the world of American politics, isolation rather than engagement might surge to the fore. If the China challenge fades, many Americans are likely to assume that the U.S. can safely reduce its global commitments.

So far, the 21st century has been an age of black swans. From 9/11 to President Trump’s election and Brexit, low-probability, high-impact events have reshaped the world order. That age isn’t over, and of the black swans still to arrive, the coronavirus epidemic is unlikely to be the last to materialize in China."
