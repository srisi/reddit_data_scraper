Conversely my mate who lives 5km away is only allowed out of his complex once every 2 days and has to present “rationed” vouchers to be able to leave. No visitors are allowed in at all.

It is total deaths vs. total recovered; the current recovered count is much too low because part of the recovered group includes people who never developed any symptoms or only developed mild symptoms and were never hospitalized.

What you are likely seeing is the death rate given you have a severe case and go to the hospital. If Neil Ferguson is correct and the detection rate is 10-25%, the death rate is 1/10th to 1/4th of what we could compute.

You cannot get a good CFR estimate during an epidemic unless you are confident you have also detected your actual infected population correctly.

Someone said that was ""hyperbolic misinformation"". However, 11 people gives a current rate of 5.04% requiring hospitalization. Every day that number will increase and plateau at some level. We will soon find out what the number is. At any rate, the difference between 5% and 18%, and getting smaller every day, by the way, is not a hyperbolic amount. My guess is that the number will slowly increase and plateau somewhere between 15-25%. Likely, closer to the middle of the range (i.e. 18-20%). Obviously, there is some gray areas of uncertainty here.

Let's take this a little further. From another paper, if you have it and need hospitalization and modern medical intervention and you don't get it, then your chances of death go up to 50-60%. Currently, everyone that needs hospital care can get it. My belief is that at some point the system will get overwhelmed. Let's use 50% for simplicity. So, 50% of the 20% above gives an overall case fatality rate of 10% (0.5 * 0.2 = 0.1). That 10% is predicated on receiving no oxygen in a hospital, no ventilator, no antibiotics for opportunistic infections, etc. In other words, you are die at home because the system is overwhelmed.  

Interestingly, 10% is about the same CFR as the 1918 Spanish influenza. That resulted in the death of 1% of all human life on the planet. My belief is that barring some miracle drug or magic vaccine, we will be seeing the same types of numbers this time around too. The final death toll, world wide, when it is all said and done (18 months), will be about 74 million. Again, a miracle cure would obviously change things in a major way. We have better tech now than we did 100 years ago. So, that's good news, right.  

Further, I also believe that China is internally seeing these same kinds of numbers which would result in a situation that matches the current video ""evidence"" we see leaking out of that country. When you use their public numbers, China's response to the crisis seems a bit much. When you use the number from above, then their response seems much more reasonable. The videos seem more accurate. The emergency hospitals seems more reasonable. People walling off their villages seems more reasonable. 

Fun Fact: The 1918 Spanish Flu ended in 1920. So, it's the 100 year anniversary."

I live in a hurricane zone, and every damned year we have something headed our way (that doesn't always come, obviously) and there's a panicked run on bread and bottled water.

It's irritating, honestly, that people don't buy a case of water at the start of the season and have some shelf-stable stuff in the pantry. Hurricane season is the same time every year, somehow they couldn't throw a pack of tortillas in the freezer and buy a couple of cans of beans or peaches or some jerky and granola bars ahead of time, even one stock item per week, so they'd starve if they can't get to the store for five days?

The most important period during virus epidemic is the beginning.

Lets compare hypothetical developments of virus in China and other country 

Other country, lets say Singapore:

1. you have 10 ill people in the community.
2. you catch 8 of them (because you are on high alert)
3. 2 will remain hidden in the community spreading the virus
4. In 5 days you will have \~2 new cases = 4 ill people in the community
5. you then catch 1 of them
6. 3 will remain hidden in the community spreading the virus
7. In another 5 day you will have \~3 new cases = 6 ill people in the community
8. ...

Situation in China during late December:

1. you have 500 ill people in the community
2. you catch 20 of them
3. 480 ill people will continue to spread the virus
4. In 5 day you will have \~ 960 new cases
5. you then catch 50 of them
6. 1440 ill people will continue to spread the virus
7. ...

You can see that in early stages of the epidemic it is much easier to keep up with the virus' speed.

China let the virus go rampant for quite some time, so the number of infected people went above critical level, so it was impossible to catch/track everybody."

This virus is highly contagious. Too early to say with certainty, but recent studies have shown this to be super contagious. See linked article below. Bottom line: ""...R0 value is likely to be between 4.7 and 6.6...""; which puts it similar to Diptheria, Smallpox, Polio, and Rubella (see second link below)  ** Of note: Spanish Flu was only between 1.4-2.8 **  If you don't know what that means, Google it. It's basically how easily it can spread. 

Additionally, there is no history of this, so everyone is at risk - no built up antibodies + there is no vaccine to prevent you from getting it. 

In addition, this virus has a high percentage of likelihood that people that have pneumonia from it, will require medical intervention. Which is not good... It would overwhelm the healthcare system. Not enough capacity to handle such large quantities of patients at once.

P.S.
(1) I could use some up-votes 😁
(2) If you really want the cr@p scared out of you. Check out a YouTube post from Leak Project dated Jan 27. I don't agree with it possibly being a bio weapon, but most of the video is very informative, and that was way back on that date - now we are approaching 70K infected, so far.

I was called a liar for reporting something I heard from alternative media.  I think this is dangerous because it creates an environment where people are afraid to post anything that isn't 100% provable.

I ask that medical staff espcially start taking action now. Starting wearing some type of PPE.

All it will take is one positive patient to walk in ER and expose the whole staff and department. without knowing it, the whole team is in quarantine and no replacements.

From blood storms to honeycomb lungs, here’s an organ-by-organ look at how COVID-19 harms humans.

11 Minute Read

By Amy McKeever

PUBLISHED February 14, 2020

Much remains unknown about the novel coronavirus ripping through China, but one thing is certain. The disease can cast a storm over the whole human body.

Such has been the nature of past zoonotic coronaviruses, ones that hopped from animals to humans like SARS and MERS. Unlike their common-cold-causing cousins, these emergent coronaviruses can spark a viral-induced fire throughout many of a person’s organs, and the new disease—dubbed ""COVID-19"" by the World Health Organization on Tuesday—is no exception when it is severe.

That helps explain why the COVID-19 epidemic has killed more than 1,300 people, surpassing the SARS death toll in a matter of weeks. While the death rate for COVID-19 appears to be a tenth of SARS, the novel coronavirus has spread faster.

Confirmed cases rose to more than 60,000 on Thursday, nearly a 50 percent jump relative to the prior day. This leap reflects a change in the way Chinese authorities are diagnosing infections instead of a massive shift in the scope of the outbreak. Rather than wait for patients to test positive for the virus, diagnoses now include anyone whose chest scan reveals COVID-19’s distinctive pattern of pneumonia. This method will hopefully allow authorities to isolate and treat patients more quickly.

If this outbreak continues to spread, there’s no telling how harmful it could become. A leading epidemiologist at the University of Hong Kong warned this week that COVID-19 could infect 60 percent of the globe if left unchecked. On Thursday, China’s National Health Commission said more than 1,700 health care workers are ill with the new virus, and the announcement came just a day after the WHO wrapped a summit on the best protocols for hospital care and the development of therapeutics, like vaccines.

But what actually happens to your body when it is infected by the coronavirus? The new strain is so genetically similar to SARS that it has inherited the title SARS-CoV-2. So combining early research on the new outbreak with past lessons from SARS and MERS can provide an answer.

The Lungs: Ground zero

For most patients, COVID-19 begins and ends in their lungs, because like the flu, coronaviruses are respiratory diseases.

They spread typically when an infected person coughs or sneezes, spraying droplets that can transmit the virus to anyone in close contact. Coronaviruses also cause flu-like symptoms: Patients might start out with a fever and cough that progresses to pneumonia or worse. (Find out how coronavirus spreads on a plane—and the safest place to sit).

After the SARS outbreak, the World Health Organization reported that the disease typically attacked the lungs in three phases: viral replication, immune hyper-reactivity, and pulmonary destruction.

Not all patients went through all three phases—in fact only 25 percent of SARS patients suffered respiratory failure, the defining signature of severe cases. Likewise, COVID-19, according to early data, causes milder symptoms in about 82 percent of cases, while the remainder are severe or critical.

Look deeper, and the novel coronavirus appears to follow other patterns of SARS, says University of Maryland School of Medicine associate professor Matthew B. Frieman, who studies highly pathogenic coronaviruses.

In the early days of an infection, the novel coronavirus rapidly invades human lung cells. Those lung cells come in two classes: ones that make mucus and ones with hair-like batons called cilia.

Mucus, though gross when outside the body, helps protect lung tissue from pathogens and make sure your breathing organ doesn’t dry out. The cilia cells beat around the mucus, clearing out debris like pollen or viruses.

Frieman explains that SARS loved to infect and kill cilia cells, which then sloughed off and filled patients’ airways with debris and fluids, and he hypothesizes that the same is happening with the novel coronavirus. That’s because the earliest studies on COVID-19 have shown that many patients develop pneumonia in both lungs, accompanied by symptoms like shortness of breath.

That’s when phase two and the immune system kicks in. Aroused by the presence of a viral invader, our bodies step up to fight the disease by flooding the lungs with immune cells to clear away the damage and repair the lung tissue.

When working properly, this inflammatory process is tightly regulated and confined only to infected areas. But sometimes your immune system goes haywire and those cells kill anything in their way, including your healthy tissue.

“So you get more damage instead of less from the immune response,” Frieman says. Even more debris clogs up the lungs, and pneumonia worsens. (Find out how the novel coronavirus compares to flu, Ebola, and other major outbreaks).

Lungs 101 The lungs replenish the body with life-giving oxygen. Learn about the anatomy of the lungs, how the organs make respiration possible, and how they are vulnerable to illnesses.

During the third phase, lung damage continues to build—which can result in respiratory failure. Even if death doesn’t occur, some patients survive with permanent lung damage. According to the WHO, SARS punched holes in the lungs, giving them “a honeycomb-like appearance”—and these lesions are present in those afflicted by novel coronavirus, too.

These holes are likely created by the immune system’s hyperactive response, which creates scars that both protect and stiffen the lungs.

When that occurs, patients often have to be put on ventilators to assist their breathing. Meanwhile, inflammation also makes the membranes between the air sacs and blood vessels more permeable, which can fill the lungs with fluid and affect their ability to oxygenate blood.

“In severe cases, you basically flood your lungs and you can’t breathe,” Frieman says. “That’s how people are dying.”

The Stomach: A shared gateway

During the SARS and MERS outbreaks, nearly a quarter of patients had diarrhea—a much more significant feature of those zoonotic coronaviruses. But Frieman says it’s still not clear whether gastrointestinal symptoms play a major part in the latest outbreak, given cases diarrhea and abdominal pain have been rare. But why does a respiratory virus bother the gut at all?

When any virus enters your body, it looks for human cells with its favorite doorways—proteins on the outside of the cells called receptors. If the virus finds a compatible receptor on a cell, it can invade."

I think the fact that even the medical professionals who spoke out on this virus were arrested may be a cause of concern... or people are just too worried about their own illnesses.

With respect to the Great Firewall. I was in China last summer, at a University campus. In my experience, all of the students had VPNs and knew how to get around the firewall - they even showed me how to do it (I was really nervous about using a VPN, or generally doing anything wrong at all, in case I got in trouble.) Pretty much every young person will do it in the same way as a whole lot of young people here watch pirated films etc. So I don't think that's the issue. That said, if you were using the VPN to post videos that the government became aware of, then they would almost certainly be able to track you down."

so far it's not entirely sure how ncov will play out. there's a strong \*possibility\* that it'll be very similar to 1918 pandemic. more or less same mortality rate. more or less as transmissible... only iirc 5x as many folks live on this planet. assuming the simplest possible extrapolation 50M (1918) -> 250M (2020) deaths.

people don't understand that this will most certainly NOT destroy civilization. i guess there's a risk of this virus mutating. but unless there are significant new developments, in all likelihood civilization is fine. 

we'll witness something that will be written about in history books far into the future, 2% of population is FUCKED, for most of folks this will mean some personal tragedies (family members / friends dying). 

the economy will take a hit, but stabilize after that and once again rely on china for cheap manufacturing of... fucking everything, i guess.

and what kind of ""international blame"" do you envision?

CCP may have a very much domestic, not international problem. it's an authoritarian regime. people arent happy with it, to put it mildly. but there wasn't a spark, some kind of trigger for a revolution. well, ncov \*may\* be it. we'll see. THIS is why CCP attacks it with all they've got."

A few people recovered from the first time by their own immune system, but the meds they use are damaging their heart tissue, and when they get it the second time, the antibody doesn’t help but makes it worse, and they die a sudden death from heart failure.”

We know that:

1. The virus began spreading just prior to Chinese New Year
2. Lots of people flew to China, and lots of people flew from China to other countries, to celebrate Chinese New Year
3. There is a higher likelihood that Chinese people in America were exposed to infected people in Wuhan just because there is a higher likelihood those Chinese Americans met with people from China over CNY
4. In the absence of knowing if my local Chinese restaurant had guests from Wuhan, or the people who work/run the restaurant visited/were visited by people from Wuhan, I should assume that there is a heightened chance they did compared to, for example, the Indian restaurant.

My anecdotal observation in Singapore is most Chinese restaurants have less turnover, and that is in a country which is predominantly ethnically Chinese.  Obviously they aren't being *racist* towards themselves, they are just taking precautions in the absence of information."

My wife is in a similar situation working as a nurse, but no one looks at her sideways when she wears a mask :) maybe a new theme idea as a Nurse. I've had friends working in your field and as important as health is, it is easy to put off getting checked out. It's cheaper and easier to try and ride it out. Have a friend come over and make soup, eat popcorn, and watch movies until it blows over. I grew up doing the same.

With this virus someone is gonna be first, and honestly those people are going to be better off. What seems to screw up the numbers is that there just isn't enough hospital services to help the high degree of critical patients once it takes over an area. With that in mind the people that get hospitalized early and infected early are going to have the best outcomes second only to the very last to get infected once demand for beds dies down. 

My advice since no work means no pay and no food is keep up what your doing with emergency supplies, hand washing, and avoiding touching your face, but don't hesitate to get checked out if you start showing symptoms. High temps, dry cough, abdominal pain and digestive issues seem to be the early onset symptoms either together or individually. At some point if it gets really bad in your city your club might shut down and you'll be glad to have supplies at that point. 

People like you and my wife in front facing service industry jobs have the highest probability of exposure. Early treatment and medical assistance will be clutch if/when that happens.

I hope that answers your question."

Saving face. The event transpired on their watch and the world is watching how their system can respond. That path forward is a minefield of possible embarrassments.

Paper tiger. Long debated is how resilient China's economy is, detractors pointing to how many crutches through currency manipulation and skirting rules to keep it going. This is an event that rips the curtain away for all to see what's behind it.

Political risk. The improbable dissent in Hong Kong refusing to fall into control has stirred risk of challenge from other regions. How this pandemic unfolds can break out in widespread unrest, China is taking a strong stance up front to try and discourage riots before they start."

This was a recurring problem with toilet paper so now they have scanners that people use to obtain a piece of toilet paper and the dispenser will not work for the same person more than once a day. Chinese health beliefs and culture encourages them to spit because this is seen as healthy and removing toxins from the body. The wet markets are extraordinarily unsanitary and many people will frequent those markets every day because there's no culture of stocking up and eating for a week, instead people buy fresh ingredients every day and cook. A lot of the ""lost generation"" does not believe in or understand the scientific approach to bacteria and viruses. Some people will wear the same clothing several days in a row because, generally, Chinese people do not sweat as much or smell as much as westerners. A lot of Chinese also do not turn away when sneezing and do not cover their mouths when sneezing.

And Asians =/= Chinese. We're talking specifically about China. Japan is the opposite extreme where even the streets are spotless and you see virtually no litter. I'd go so far as to say Japan is the cleanest country on the planet. There are also plenty of people who don't wear face masks even when sick, it's usually the careful people and the ones who can afford to wear them who will wear them.

Hoping I am wrong, but I agree it may be brewing, indeed.  Further, we are all counting (hoping!) on this being a seasonal virus much like flu season's global migration.  Two things to say about that - China needs some breathing room to recover (no pun intended).  Second, if covid19 does not exhibit seasonal spikes and is brewing, that's a bigger deal than the powers that be would like to accept.

\-Patient and her husband were in Wuhan province 14 days ago (February 1st?)

\-Patient saw her regular doctor on February 5th, complaining of major fatigue. They thought it might be her endocrine  problem, but he sent in a test for the virus just to be safe.

\-She's now brought to the emergency room due to confirmation of the virus. She can't breath on her own and has a rash.

There is a reason healthcare workers who may have to wear disposable n95 respirators while treating sick patients are required by law to undergo respirator fit testing every single year. 

For true fit testing, a machine determines if a mask makes a good enough seal while you do various activities (deep breathing, talking, leaning over, moving your head up and down, etc.) by measuring ambient vs mask concentrations of an aerosolized test substance. 

That’s not possible for you at home, but you basically need to move around and breathe and feel if the mask allows air to be sucked in around its edges at all. If you breathe deeply and quickly, the mask should suction to your face and even collapse. If it allows you to suck air around its edges, it’s not fully protecting you because it’s allowing you to breathe unfiltered air. Some people will say to spray perfume and see if you can smell it. That may work as a test but some smells can get through n95s afaik."

380 is (I am pretty sure) ALL of the Americans. But then alas without article explicitly explaining why they said “some”, I think it is because later the article says 

“A CDC team is on the ground in Japan to assess the health of the passengers, Dr. Walke said. Those with a fever, cough or other symptoms won’t be allowed on the flights.”

So ALL are eligible but likely a few sick ones will be left behind, thus “some”. Imagine being sick with cough or flu and this stuck on the death ship while all the other Americans fly off.  Jesus. 

Also says “Travis is already the quarantine site for roughly 230 people evacuated from Wuhan earlier this month, and Dr. Walke spoke in a town-hall meeting with those people on Friday. These evacuees will be kept separate from the fresh group arriving from the ship, he said.”"

* Impermissible disclosures of protected health information (PHI)
* Unauthorized accessing of PHI
* Improper disposal of PHI
* Failure to conduct a risk analysis
* Failure to manage risks to the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of PHI
* Failure to implement safeguards to ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of PHI
* Failure to maintain and monitor PHI access logs
* Failure to enter into a HIPAA-compliant business associate agreement with vendors prior to giving access to PHI
* Failure to provide patients with copies of their PHI on request
* Failure to implement access controls to limit who can view PHI
* Failure to terminate access rights to PHI when no longer required
* The disclosure more PHI than is necessary for a particular task to be performed
* Failure to provide [HIPAA training](https://www.netsec.news/hipaa-training/) and security awareness training
* Theft of patient records
* Unauthorized release of PHI to individuals not authorized to receive the information
* Sharing of PHI online or via social media without permission
* Mishandling and mismailing PHI
* Texting PHI
* Failure to encrypt PHI or use an alternative, equivalent measure to prevent unauthorized access/disclosure
* Failure to notify an individual (or the Office for Civil Rights) of a security incident involving PHI within 60 days of the discovery of a breach
* Failure to document compliance efforts

No-one is disputing the cloud of uncertainty over this virus. The WHO is still trying to get a fact-finding team on the ground in China, without much success.

So telling nations that their actions need to be ""based on science"" when the science is far from settled lacks credibility. The WHO evidently also wants to hold other nations to a different standard than China. It was China that stopped tour groups from leaving the country, China has closed down businesses, public transport, imposed compulsory quarantines on entire cities - and apparently suppressed some information on this epidemic.

WHO has in fact painted itself into a corner where they have lost credibility with the health authorities in many countries around the world. That's a significant problem for a ""world leading"" health authority. No question WHO has world leading consultants on call, but the impression they are creating is that their headquarters staff have become overly concerned with geopolitics and not the business of medicine."

There is important work to be done and much that isn't known.  A sense of urgency and humility will calm the public much more than the premature back-patting that seems to make them all feel so good about themselves.   I think they believe it is supposed to be reassuring, ""All is well.  Remain calm.  Trust authority."", but I think it has the opposite effect.  

Before accepting the WHO belief that main transmission occurs through droplets, which doesn't mean it can't also be aerosolized as a secondary means of transmission, I'd like a better explanation for why this seems to be so infectious compared to other viruses spread through droplets (e.g. SARS also believed to spread through droplets).  So I'm inclined to take that with a grain of salt until I receive better information."

If you are stocking up on essentials, go for it. If you are reading up and learning how to minimize risk, doing your individual job, please go for it.

But if you are in a non-infected area obsessively sanitizing everything and self isolating, you should check yourself. If you are panicking telling everyone that the world is ending, you need to check yourself.
