Is this the kinda stuff they're using to justify the ""other health problems"" designation on a lot of victims? 

If so, that's worrying. Because a childhood condition that was outgrown and beating cancer 4-years ago aren't exactly things I would think have a huge impact on your current state of health."

The healthcare system is **extremely** good. The quality of care is very high, doctors are very well educated, and the system provides an amazing level of service for the cost. Considering Italy's reputation for broken bureaucracy, it's nothing short of astounding how good healthcare is here. 

However, the things that make a system good for the typical year over year societal needs don't necessarily make the system the best able to cope with a 100-year pandemic. For example, Germany has about 2x the number of ICU beds per capita. So does the USA.

42 patients enrolled **(average age 45)**

26 patients randomized to treatment group (Hydroxychloroquine +/- Azithro)

16 patients randomized to control group

From the treatment group they lost 6 people due to ""early cessation of treatment."" This is what happened to those 6

1. transferred to ICU on treatment day 2
2. transferred to ICU on treatment day 3
3. transferred to ICU on treatment day 4
4. dead on treatment day 3
5. quit the study
6. stopped treatment due to nausea

**So we can see from the treatment group that out of 26 patients, 3 were sent to the ICU and 1 died**

Now you have 36 patients left. 20 treatment and 16 control, which are divided based on symptoms at the start of the trial

Asymptomatic  **= 16%**

Upper respiratory symptoms (mainly cough/fever) = **61%**

Lower respiratory symptoms (pneumonia on CT) = **23%**

So basically, 77% of these remaining patients would not even be admitted to a hospital for treatment in reality.

That leaves **9 patients** in this study who would be serious enough to actually treat

3 patients transferred to the ICU

1 patient dead

* When was the last time you saw an international case infected in China?

* People are flooding into China to avoid the outbreak, hence the huge increase in airfare prices going into China, the increasing number of imported cases and stronger measures to quarantine international travelers coming into China.

* 41 medical teams totaling over 3,600 HCWs leaving Wuhan and going home because they are no longer needed

* all 14 cubicle hospitals in Wuhan closed

* schools in Gansu reopening

* Anhui releasing a policy for ""mask usage in low risk area"" with 7 conditions where mask wearing is no longer required

Hospitals are overwhelmed, every nook and cranny is filled with patients.

Patients are all on respirators, only thing keeping them alive, as they're not able to breathe on their own. Despite this, patients are dying. 

Most patients have that bubble thing over their heads, as that's an attempt of equalizing the pressure in their lungs. Difficult to communicate through it.  One patient in the video seems a little better off and is using his touch phone, most look like they're comatose.

Staff is overworked, overstressed, and has never experienced anything like it.

Doctor interviewed makes an immediate point of refuting that this is just a type of flu. Compares it to a sort of intense pneumonia, if anything.

Testing is happening 24/7 and they're just not keeping up.

These workers are doing an essential service by continuing to work and allowing Costco stores to remain open.  If they and their counterparts at other stores went home, and people lost the ability to buy food and other essential supples, things would go downhill super fast.

Our cashiers who had to go with out those critical supplies have been known to be less then friendly with those people after hurricanes.

Unfortunately right before this really started hitting us we lost and operator and a lab person. So I was already an operator so I'm picking up the extra slack (we're a 24/7 plant) and I'm being trained as a chemist in the laboratory. And of course between my shift and the missing persons shift there's a lot of overtime every week and I have never in my time here turned down overtime. Even if that meant working 3pm to 7am. I love my home town and never have moved away or nothing and I'm willing to do what I can to make sure my folks have clean water coming to their homes it makes me feel good knowing that everyone in town can have a clean shower or a glass of water and not fret about it. Water Treatment and Waste Water plants are some of the most under appreciated departments in government or in general and we take care of your water needs and your poop (lol). So we don't typically get much recognition for the work we do but honestly I could care less if we receive it I just know deep down that people can live a healthy and clean lifestyle because of me and the few other people that take care of our town"

Just a basketball team. … I’ve been told by our doctors, medical community, we shouldn’t be testing asymptomatic people at this point in California. … We’ve been told there’s not enough tests to do that.”

I honestly don't even know what to think at this point.

I'm currently waiting to hear back on whether I test positive for COVID-19 or not.

I've had blue lips since last night so I called the hotline to find out if I should go into the dr. They sent me to the AF hospital.

I reported to the tent and told them I'm awaiting my COVID-19 test, I've had a fever of 102.6 on Monday, then averaging about 99 for the last two days. I have a dry cough and shortness of breath and my lips have been blue since last night.

They took my vitals and told me to wait in a makeshift room.

The nurse that checked me out was abrasive and treated me like she thought I was faking everything. I told her all of my symptoms and that I had called the hotline because my lips had been blue for over 12 hours. She told me to ''pull down your mask'', so I did. Then in a very annoyed tone told me they weren't blue and that they could do an x-ray on my chest if I wanted. I opted for the x-ray. The Dr. that ordered the x-ray suggested that I also be swabbed to test for other flu's.

After waiting about 30 minutes, they took me into a hallway and x-rayed me with a portable machine.

Another 30 minutes and the nurse checked my vitals again preparing me for discharge. I asked if they were still going to swab me to which she replied no.

Another 5 minutes of waiting and she came back with a packet of information saying ''I guess they're calling it bronchitis''. Then telling me that even if my COVID-19 test is positive, not to come back unless I am *REALLY* struggling to breathe. Ok fine, I get it, but I felt like I couldn't breathe and my lips were blue. The hotline said to go straight to the ER, not to an instacare.

**HERE'S WHERE IT GETS WEIRD:** I went home and logged onto my health profile to see the notes from the Dr. and found out that she LIED about my symptoms. Writing that I didn't complain of any significant fevers, and that my dry cough was sometime productive.

Been sick for almost 2 weeks after exposure (first and second hand) to two people who either returned home to the US or recently traveled from their home outside the country to the US.  I'm immune-compromised.  I can't get a test because 1) they're limited based on certain guidelines that I don't meet; 2) I guess we only have 500 fucking tests in the whole state and, ""eh, maybe we'll get more"" next week?  I am not likely to die from this (hopefully), but my God, so many people will.  So far I've been able to work from home, but I'm expected to report to the office on Saturday to do a mass mailing (a thing federally mandated so can't be missed or the company I work for will face large fines).  I'm terrified of going out, I'm terrified of the length of time this virus survives on surfaces and the chance that I might leave contaminate in the office to infect other immune-compromised associates (who are coming in on Sunday because they don't want us in proximity to each other).  Always half measures, man.  But I can't really risk losing my job over some stupid fucking letters ... and yet I grow more and more resentful of the very obvious value human life does not have in this country.  And I 100% count myself lucky because 1) still working; 2) still getting paid despite hours cut/pay cut.  But goddamn.  I am so scared, and I am so afraid I may have this fucking virus and may hurt people.  I am even more angry about being in this ""rock and a hard place"" situation because there's not human decency in this country - but certainly not in the south.  I mean, I guess that falls in line with the fucking track record."

	The only US drugmaker that makes a potential treatment for the coronavirus that was touted by President Donald Trump raised the price by almost 100 per cent in January, as the virus caused havoc across China.

Rising Pharmaceuticals, a New Jersey based company, increased the price of chloroquine — an antimalarial, which is one of the drugs that is being tested against Covid-19 — on January 23, according to data from research firm Elsevier. The drug price rose 97.86 per cent to $7.66 per 250mg pill and $19.88 per 500mg pill. 

But Rising said the price rise was “coincidental” and it restored the old price once it realised that the drug might be in demand because of the outbreak. The reversal of the price lift has not yet shown through in the data. 

In an interview with the Financial Times, one executive said that the company had originally increased the price because it wanted to be able to invest in new manufacturing facilities to keep the drug on the market. 

“As soon as we saw the increase in demand and the potential that this was going to be utilised in the way some folks are projecting it to be, we rescinded that price increase to the same price it has been on the market for since 2015,” he said. 

Hiking drug prices at such a pivotal time in world history will not play well in the market for any companies partaking in that activity long term

Michael Rea, chief executive RxSavings Solutions
Mr Trump said on Thursday that the Food and Drug Administration had approved chloroquine for the treatment of Covid-19 — but the FDA commissioner contradicted him, saying the regulator was simply taking a closer look at the drug. The drug is already approved for treating malaria. 

There is no solid evidence that chloroquine improves the condition of coronavirus patients. But there are several trials under way and the drug is being used on a “compassionate use” basis in some countries. 

Small studies have shown positive outcomes, including one in France released on Wednesday that chloroquine had accelerated recoveries and reduced how long patients were contagious. The medicine can have serious side effects, however, including acute poisoning and even death if a patient overdoses. 

Michael Rea, chief executive of RxSavings Solutions, which provides software for employers to lower their drug bills, said: “Hiking drug prices at such a pivotal time in world history will not play well in the market for any companies partaking in that activity long term.” 

In December 2019, Rising Pharmaceuticals admitted price fixing in a case in Pennsylvania and agreed to pay $3m in fines and restitution. The company did not respond to a request for comment about that case. 

The executive speaking on behalf of the company said it is not promoting the drug as a treatment for coronavirus. But Rising received five times as many orders as usual in the last week and it is ramping up production in India to meet demand, purchasing “extraordinary amounts” of more active ingredients, bottles and labels. 

“We have no real knowledge of where this is going to end but we are actively keeping up with demand,” he said."

People are actually out more now than they were before in my area, because my area has gone psycho with hoarding food and whatnot. I went to a couple different stores yesterday, and it felt like Black Friday. I got the last pack of toilet paper at one store, and asked the cashier when that shipment came in. My receipt says I checked out at 4:21 p.m. That shipment came in at 3 p.m. 

In addition, there are no eggs, milk, butter, cleaning products, or bread left in my entire county, because people are hanging out outside of stores all day (since they can't work) waiting for trucks to come in. 

It's awful; it really demonstrates how selfish Americans are."

For some reason all I wanted while I was in there on TPN was a donut. I had dreams about donuts. Specifically this one donut from Dunkin’ Donuts. They make this apple pie donut that has apples on the inside and is coated in a cinnamon and powdered sugar dust. It’s so fucking good I was fantasizing about it the whole two weeks I was in the hospital.

So after 2 weeks I get out and immediately map to the closest Dunkin’ Donuts. Turns out they didn’t exist here then. All they had were Top Pot (fuck everything about cake donuts. A donut isn’t cake it’s a donut) and Krispy Kreme. And while Krispy Kreme is fine, I really had my heart set on this apple pie panacea I’d been dreaming about for a fortnight.

The nice thing about suddenly finding out you’re not a healthy person and never will be again is that your healthy family members feel guilty and give you stuff. My sister overnighted me some apple pie donuts from across the country. They were a little stale, but man were they awesome.

And that’s my story of going temporarily crazy for food in the hospital."
