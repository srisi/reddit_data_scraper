Last month in Wuhan, China, cases of lung disease were increasing, and a new strain of Coronavirus as the cause is being considered.

The woman showed signs of fevers while in Wuhan, and was hospitalized when they returned to Japan. That was the first time a person infected with Coronavirus was found in Japan. The woman was released from the hospital after 15 days.

While the woman was in Wuhan, they did not go to the fish market, where a lot of people with the lung disease were, but they did say that they met with someone who was sick. 

In Wuhan, 41 people were found to have the new Coronavirus strain, and a 61 year old woman has died.

They're referring to Wuhan Pneumonia, a mostly isolated outbreak of what has recently found to be a virus belonging to the *Coronaviridae* family via Electron Microscopy and genome sequencing. The new virus currently is currently called 2019_nCoV.  This would make it the 7th virus in the family to be able to infect Humans. Although the family includes SARS and MERS, this is a new virus. People are obviously concerned an new emerging coronavirus in humans as they can pose a high risk. Fortunately it seems this one does not seem to be capable of efficient human to human spread. However despite most cases being linked to a seafood market in the city, there does seem to be some evidence of limited humanto human spread. 

Coronaviruses are however thought to be responsible for a large number of ""serious colds"" which can obviously be dangerous to those at risk, elderly, children etc. But despite it seeming that this new virus does not pose too much of a threat due to limited spread, it should not be dismissed as ""just another coronavirus as they only cause the common cold"", especially till we know more.

The 69-year-old man had been admitted to hospital with abnormal renal function and severe damage to multiple organs, the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission said in a statement on its website. He died on Jan. 15.

In all, 41 cases of pneumonia have been reported in Wuhan, which preliminary lab tests cited by state media showed could be from a new type of coronavirus, a large family of viruses that can cause infections ranging from the common cold to deadly Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS).

Japan on Thursday confirmed a man in his 30s had been infected with the virus and a Chinese woman has also been quarantined in Thailand with a mystery strain of coronavirus. The World Health Organization (WHO) has warned a wider outbreak is possible.

Some 763 people have been put under observation in Wuhan after coming in to close contact with known patients, health authorities said on Thursday. Of these, 644 have been released and 119 are still being monitored.

A 61-year-old man died earlier in the city from pneumonia, after testing positive for the virus.

The outbreak comes ahead of the Lunar New Year holiday in late January, when many of China’s 1.4 billion people will be travelling to their home towns or abroad.

Memories remain fresh in Asia of a 2002/03 outbreak ofSARS which emerged in China and killed nearly 800 people worldwide."
