# Stockholm will reach 'herd immunity' within weeks

**RICHARD ORANGE** APRIL 18, 2020

Sweden's infectious diseases chief has said parts of the country could achieve ""herd immunity"" as early as next month as debate rages over the rising death toll.

The country's[ laissez faire experiment with coronavirus](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/politics/2020/04/16/sweden-has-shown-not-tackle-coronavirus-fights-now-save-face/) restrictions has made it a European outlier - drawing intrigue from around the globe.

Data this week showed the rate of new cases peaking for the first time as deaths continued to outstrip neighbouring countries with strict lockdowns.

Both the architects and the critics of Sweden's approach - which has left kindergartens, schools, restaurants, cafés and bars open - have both seized on new figures, claiming tentative victories.

Anders Tegnell, the state epidemiologist who has been the figurehead of Sweden's strategy, said: ""We're still at the level we were at a couple of weeks ago. There was some kind of peak before the Easter weekend, and now there's some kind of downturn.""

[How countries plan to save Covid-19 hit economies](https://cf-particle-html.eip.telegraph.co.uk/e4bd6717-7b87-4642-86dc-f4aad6634964.html)

Later that evening he told Norwegian TV's leading weekly debate programme that the models run by his colleagues at the Public Health Agency of Sweden indicated that the population in Stockholm, the centre of Sweden's epidemic, could achieve herd immunity as early as next month.

""According to our modellers, we are starting to see so many immune people in the population in Stockholm that it is starting to have an effect on the spread of the infection,"" he said.

""Our models point to some time in May,"" he added, when asked about herd immunity in the capital. ""These are mathematical models, they're only as good as the data we put into them. We will see if they are right.""

One of the advantages of her immunity and loose social restrictions is protecting the economy.

But while Sweden has stopped short of forcing the closure of restaurants and bars, card data from Swedbank to be released on Monday shows a ""sharp drop in activity in the first two weeks of April"", with restaurants particularly affected, according to Andreas Wallström, the bank's chief economist.

IMF forecasts this week also predicted GDP would shrink by 6.8 per cent, broadly in line with other more restrictive countries around the continent.

Mr Tegnell's upbeat assessment came on a day when the number of recorded deaths from coronavirus in Sweden rose 130 in a single day to 1,333. By Friday the death toll had hit 1,400. Sweden's death rate is much higher than in its Nordic neighbours, but it remains comfortably better off than much more locked-down countries such as the UK and France.

Lena Einhorn, the virologist who is one of the few public critics of Sweden's strategy, told the Sunday Telegraph she was incredulous that Dr Tegnell could present this week's dismal figures as good news.

""In Finland on Thursday the cumulative number was 13 dead per million inhabitants, in Sweden it was 130 per million inhabitants. Finland: 75 dead, Norway: 152 dead, Sweden: 1,333 dead,"" she said. ""And yet Anders Tegnell is saying 'we are feeling very hopeful'. What are they hopeful about?"".

Even without being ordered into lockdown, Swedes have nonetheless been practising social distancing. Neighbouring countries like Norway and Denmark began lifting social restrictions this week, bringing much of Scandinavia broadly back in line with Sweden.

Einhorn was one of 22 scientists who in a letter published in the Dagens Nyheter newspaper on Tuesday called for Sweden's government to break urgently with the country's tradition of leaving decisions to expert agencies, seize control of coronavirus strategy from Dr Tegnell and the agency's chief Johan Carlson, and impose a similar lockdown to those seen in Finland, Norway and Denmark.

But although the group included some of the country's most eminent epidemiologists, including several with senior positions its elite Karolinska Institutet medical university, their call has backfired.

Media commentators rounded on them, with one accusing them of ""behaving like scandal-mongers"". None of the leaders of Sweden's opposition parties has risked criticising the Public Health Agency, or attacking the country's overall strategy.

It is too early to tell whether Sweden's gamble will pay off, but the country, it seems, is doubling down."

The Covid-19 shutdowns have been based on the premise that the disease would kill more than two million Americans absent drastic actions to slow its spread. That model assumed case fatality rates—the share of infected people who die from the disease—of 1% to 3%. The World Health Organization’s estimated case-fatality rate was 3.4%.

Some experts—including in these pages—have questioned this assumption. They argue that known cases are likely only a small portion of the true number of infections, and thus high case-fatality rates could be off by orders of magnitude. We don’t know what portion of infections have gone undetected for a lack of tests, restrictive qualifications to get tested, and a potentially large incidence of mild illness or asymptomatic infection.

New data support the skeptics’ view—a preliminary study by a Stanford team, released Friday. They conducted a seroprevalence study of Santa Clara County, Calif., on April 3 and 4. They studied a representative sample of 3,300 residents to test for the presence of antibodies in their blood that would show if they had previously been infected with the novel coronavirus.

The county, where I live, is home to about two million people in the heart of Silicon Valley, including San Jose, the state’s third-largest city. It has the largest known number of cases in Northern California and saw some of the earliest cases of community spread in the U.S.
The researchers found that the percentage of infections was indeed vastly larger than the roughly 1,000 known positive cases in the county at the time of the study. The preliminary results—the research will now undergo peer review—show that between 2.5% and 4.2% of county residents are estimated to have antibodies against the virus. That translates into 48,000 to 81,000 infections, 50 to 85 times as high as the number of known cases.
That may sound scary, but it’s great news. It suggests that the large majority of people who contract Covid-19 recover without ever knowing they were infected, and that the U.S. infection fatality rate may be more than an order of magnitude lower than authorities had assumed. Based on this seroprevalence data, the authors estimate that in Santa Clara County the true infection fatality rate is somewhere in the range of 0.12% to 0.2%—far closer to seasonal influenza than to the original, case-based estimates.
Outside California as well, preliminary data are emerging to support a more hopeful picture. In New York City, a study published in the New England Journal of Medicine examined 215 women entering two hospitals to give birth between March 22 and April 4. These patients had a Covid-19 infection rate over 15%. Of expectant mothers who tested positive for active infections, 88% were asymptomatic at the time of admission. That infection rate is about 10 times the rate of known cases in the city as a whole as of April 17—and New Yorkers have been tested for Covid-19 far more extensively than residents of other states.
This study looked only at active infections, not past infections as in Santa Clara County. So in that population of pregnant women, 15% infected is a lower bound. Many others may have had a past infection only detectable on serologic tests for antibodies against the virus.
Similar proportions of infections to cases are now being discovered around the world: 30 times in Robbio, Italy; 10 times in Iceland; 14 times in Gangelt, Germany; 27 times in Denmark. Germany and Denmark are now leading Europe in reopening their economies in the coming week. Sweden, concerned all along with the accuracy of early assumptions, never closed down its economy.

2020-04-18,ttoxicite,LockdownSkepticism,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/LockdownSkepticism/comments/g3uvl9/how_do_you_reconcile_wanting_to_open_up_the/fnu1ax0/,"Warning: long 

Please note that not all of us, I would even say most of us don’t believe that we should just flat out open the country 100% and stop taking precautions. Most of us believe we should open in phases/take targeted approaches to those at risk/ open up, but still wear face masks, etc. 

This is what I explain when people ask why I do not favor the lockdown. 

Many, many credible sources have stated that it could be up to a year and a half until we create a vaccine for the coronavirus, and it will definitely be at least a year. 

Until we find a vaccine, COVID19 will not go away. Numerous studies have demonstrated that no matter how much we quarantine, and have lockdowns, the MOMENT we stop quarantining, cases WILL skyrocket. This is shown by the several countries that have already started having second waves. Lockdown will reduce cases drastically - but ONLY DURING THE LOCKDOWN. Studies have stated that this will be the case until the year to year and a half in which we find a vaccine. 

This means that in order for this 100% all out lockdown to remain actually effective the way it has been, without a spike in deaths taking place, we would have to carry it out for a full year to a year and a half. 

A lockdown of that length is not feasible. That can’t be refuted. If we do this for that long, we WILL enter at LEAST a Depression. We have ALREADY surpassed the unemployment rate during the first year of the Great Depression and it has only been a month. With things going the way they are right now, we may enter one worse than the last one. And the economy will NOT just snap back once we stop quarantining; the damage will have already been done.

We must find a solution that finds a balance with both the economy and the virus. If you think that a Depression won’t have just as bad or worse consequences than the virus itself, then you don’t understand how economics or an economic depression work. 

During Depression, people’s lives are ruined. Suicide rates increase. People starve. And just like what happened in the 1930s, an American depression will not just stay in America, it will effect the whole world due to how vital the USA is to the global economy. A global depression means that ESPECIALLY people in third world countries will almost certainly experience mass famine, which could translate to MILLIONS of deaths. Not to mention, 40,000 people killed themselves in 1 year during the Great Depression. 

**At what point do we weigh these possibilities? Since all of our actions are based on potential death numbers.**

We MUST find a different approach to this that weighs every single factor that will be affected by this, not solely deaths from the virus. ACKNOWLEDGING THAT IS NOT DENOUNCING THE VIRUS! 

It will be very difficult to find an approach as basically no matter what we do people will die, but we have to do better than the ill thought out and panicked measures we currently have in place. 

Let’s look at the facts we have readily available. The primary people dying from this are the elderly and immunocompromised. In Italy for example, the average age of death is 79 and 99.2% of people who died had pre existing conditions. Several studies have shown that if we took a targeted approach (ie quarantining) to those who are elderly/immunocompromised then we would STILL reduce COVID deaths by two thirds. With healthy people going back to work and life being more normal (while still practicing social distancing and minimizing extremely large gatherings) this could make the difference between a recession and a global depression 

One idea that has been suggested besides this to combat COVID-19 while still being open is that we could mass produce N95 masks to the point that they can be required by law to be worn in public. That way, people can still engage with the economy but the transmission rate will be lowered significantly which will make it easier on our healthcare system

Mass production of N95 masks would be very difficult though, so we could also just legally require everyone to where some type of mask. Not as effective but help on a large scale. 
 
It’s a difficult scenario to address, but we HAVE to do better than a 100% lockdown of the country and economy for a year+. It is just not sustainable. 

We want a more long term, realistic plan will be released to address COVID19. 

**TLDR: Lockdown is just pushing out the problem. It is not feasible to wait until a vaccine is introduced to open back up. At some point we will have to deal with the COVID-19 deaths due to opening back up without the vaccine, and the more economic stress and depression we cause by pushing that out, more people will die. That is what this sub is acknowledging.**"

That's a bit unfortunate. It means that even if they somehow improve the affinity of this antibody it might only work on a subset of the virus that's about to do its thing.

I'd also like to know what this shape-shifting is. My understanding is that viruses are pretty much inate on their own so I'm guessing they mean once it starts to join with the cell membrane?"

I wanna say that I LOVE this sub-Reddit. It’s just so nice to see others who think like me? Feel like me, and totally understand me. 

Now that I’ve said that? 

I have learned this about my own experience with ADHD: 

After about 60-90 days? I lose all motivation to do anything routine. So I’m always learning new things, trying new things and seeing what I wanna keep. It’s been fun and keeps me going. 

What has worked best for me? Working in highly stimulating jobs. I worked in a bar for years!!
Loved it. The noise. The people. The other co-workers. God it was great. 
I started a side gig about five years ago doing hair and makeup for weddings. 
The tension, meeting new people, the fact it’s a WEDDING and it’s high stress?! Give me more. Give me 5 of them in a day!!! I need the dopamine!!

Lost the bar job two years ago. I had no idea how much that “routine” had become a part of me. And what my ADHD needs to “function”. 
I’ve had to REALLY struggle to make my life work since then. 
I still have the hair and makeup gig? But it’s just not “enough”. It’s seasonal. Gets boring. Perfect ADHD issues....

It’s gotten better? But. Damn. I HaTE RoUtINE. 
So many people say “just work in sales/a bank/ retail/ a salon etc.... that I’m good with people. Yes. I am good with people? But only in large, ridiculous quantities, on my terms. Lol. 

I... just... can’t!!!!! Do “normal” It’s just too “the same”. I need a night owl gig with booze, drama, too many people and all-nighters..... PERIOD. 
Once I accepted that? I totally found another bar gig. God it was relief and fun. I got my routines back. Workouts back. All of it. 

Aaannnddd now? Coronavirus. And I’m at home. 

We shall see what the rest of this year brings me. 

We should unite and accept that since our brains are wired a certain way? We need to accept that. And embrace that. 

Just my two cents."

Why do you think NYC and NOLA are overwhelmed right now if it's just like the flu? It wouldn't matter if the percentage of vented patients was the same between the flu and novel coronavirus, because so many more people have the coronavirus right now that there are going to be more deaths. Sooo many people are having severe respiratory distress from this that we literally don't have the capacity and supply chain in place to deal with it. That's why it's such a big deal. 1% of 100 is way different than 1% of 10000.

Edited to add that we almost always know if the patient receiving care is coronavirus positive. You don't just get the virus, suddenly die at home, and then it's too late to confirm cause of death because sunlight destroyed it. Furthermore, you can most definitely confirm in death if coronavirus is in the lungs and the cause of the ARDS which led to death. The numbers are not overinflated."

I’m 34M, also in Texas so I understand what you’re dealing with as far as the culture here. (Well as much as a man can understand your gender specific struggles) Shameful that our state gov. used CoronaVirus to attack women’s reproductive rights again. I very much don’t want kids either, you mention having to raise the family and “pick up after” or basically take care of the man. I’m most cases you are right, they don’t realize it but most men just want another mother in their wife. I just come at this from the other gender perspective in that I dont want to support kids and a woman. A lot of women just want to get with a man, have kids, and thus be supported/taken care of without having to contribute or work at all. I feel like our thought processes and general ideas about things are pretty similar, just that we see things through the respective lenses of our genders. It’s nice to know that there are women out there like you (especially in Texas). I’m all about being in a mutually respectful, supportive relationship, but having kids is 100% a deal breaker for me which makes it hard to find someone. It’s hard enough in general, let alone getting past I will never ever change my mind about wanting kids conversation. Not even in a few years, not even if I really love you. In my 20’s I was in a serious relationship (living together for years) and we eventually got engaged. She knew I didn’t want kids, as the wedding got closer, she started talking about and asking, “well how long after the wedding do you want to start trying to have our first child?” Uh.... fucking never, like I’ve always said. Cue the “i didn’t think you really meant it/if you really loved me... blah blah blah. Needless to say, there was no wedding and she moved out of my house shortly thereafter."

The North Melbourne midfielder has taken the opportunity to reconnect with the land during the coronavirus shutdown after returning home to Darwin with his young family.

As much as he would love to be playing footy, with that not an option, there is no place he would rather be than back at home reunited with his seven siblings.

“We have such a massive family and some of my brothers and sisters have got kids, so they are taking them out and about,” he told The Weekend Australian.

“You can just relax into the Darwin lifestyle, pretty much. You can still get out and about a little bit up here, while still being very cautious with the guidelines.”

The immediate aftermath of the season suspension sparked a frenzy of activity in the Anderson household. The 26-year-old and his wife Nicky had their bags and boys packed and on a plane within a day to beat the border closure.

Fresh medical arrangements were made in the NT capital, with Anderson’s wife due to give birth to their first daughter next month.

Consoling words were offered to his two sons Elijah, 7, and Jasiah, 5, who were confused as to why they were leaving footy, school and their home behind in such a rush.

But from the hustle and bustle of city life in Melbourne, Anderson’s recent weeks in Darwin demonstrate that a crisis can create an opportunity.

It is eight years since the one-time Darwin Buffalo has spent time in his hometown during the dry season and it has sparked old memories while creating new ones.

The initial training sessions as the wet season gradually washed away were brutal, leaving Anderson drenched with sweat.

Despite coming off a Melbourne summer, nothing can prepare an athlete for the Darwin wet season, where the temperature sits around 33C with a humidity level of 80 per cent.

“Those first two weeks were pretty hard. The first week and a half really got to me,” he told The Weekend Australian.

“It is pretty hard running up here and you have to find that motivation and drive to do it, because it is such high intensity.

“It will hopefully give me a little bit of an edge on the other boys and other teams when we are back playing.”

But it is the time spent with family that will make this moment so memorable for Anderson.

While his family are based in the northern suburbs of Darwin, they are staying with his wife’s parents in inner-city Bayview.

Once training and online commitments with the Kangaroos are complete, Anderson and his boys head out into nature for the day.

It might be hunting one day, some fishing the next. And securing a metre-long barramundi is an annual challenge among the Anderson clan that he is revelling pursuing once again.

“The barra is at the end of its run with the water coming off the floodplains and into the ocean,” he said.

“The elusive metre-long barra, I’ve caught a few myself, and my family has as well, so there is always a competition between us.”

Being able to pass on the lessons he learnt from his father David, who died of a heart attack shortly after Anderson had captained the NT’s under-18 team, has also been a blessing.

The pair were particularly close according to his older brother Joe Anderson, who spent four seasons with Carlton between 2007 and 2010.

“Dad pretty much died in Jed’s arms. Jed had to go through that ordeal and I think he even tried to resuscitate dad as well,” Joe Anderson told the AFL website in 2018.

“He’s had a lot to deal with as a young person — probably more than most would come across in their life — so hopefully a few people realise he has gone through a lot of hardship.”

The layoff has given Anderson, whose grandfather Jimmy is considered a “local legend” who played in the WAFL and made the AFLNT Team of the Century, a chance to link generations.

“One of the local spots we go to is where Dad used to catch some and I have been able to show that to the boys. This puts life back into perspective, really,” he said.

“Don’t get me wrong, because I’d love to be playing — but we can get caught up in that footy bubble and it can be hard to get out of. I can get out and reconnect with the land, go out fishing and hunting, and take the boys out with me and explain things to them.

“I want to teach my kids and they want to come out and do that stuff, so it is a good opportunity.”

When the time comes to step back into footy, Anderson will be ready to go.

There are a handful of AFL footballers back in Darwin that he may arrange some training with during the break.

Geelong’s Brandon Parfitt, Saint Ben Long and Gold Coast draftee Malcolm Rosas, who is also a grandson of AFLNT legend Jimmy Anderson, are in town, while North Melbourne teammate Jy Simpkin has ducked across to far-north Western Australia to visit his girlfriend’s family.

But in the meantime, some fishing in the warmth while awaiting the birth of his daughter sounds an ideal way to pass the shutdown."

 [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3164579/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3164579/) 

>Recent growth of the influenza market has led to investments that have increased current global capacity for seasonal influenza vaccine to around 600M northern hemisphere doses. Northern Hemisphere production capacity is expected to be approx 750–800M doses per year. 

First off, they talk about production capacity in PER YEAR numbers. Even if we had production capacity similar to the regular flu shot, which everyone should get every year, when it's mid 2021 and a vaccine finally becomes available if you're not one of those lucky 800 million then just stay indoors and try your luck again in 2022. We're talking how many years after production started will you be able to get your vaccine. 

That's enough for like the US, Japan, Germany, France, all other countries? Maybe 2022. Although I wonder where US would even rank on the priority list, with all the pharmaceutical companies working on vaccines in the US, it would probably be US companies mostly making it.  However they have a free market, so you will have entire countries bidding against private individuals on an extremely limited supply. A country like Norway comes and bids $10,000 per dose for the initial million doses to vaccinate their elderly and healthcare workers, is Biden or Trump gonna force big pharma to only sell to US customers, will companies ignore the market price and just take the lower profit for the good of the people?

Maybe there's hope with these new RNA and DNA vaccines that are supposedly easier to  mass produce. Although in that article they are still only talking about maybe 1-10 million doses/month in 2021, and it's one of only 4 vaccines currently in phase 1 trials, each person needs 2 doses. 

Our vaccine infrastructure is really not ready for this."

This places the UK’s covid death reporting policies substantially behind many other countries. I would encourage anyone interested in the reliability of the data always to check the policies of each country individually, because there is enormous room for error when some categories of deaths are uncounted. Only very recently did New York adjust its count to 3000 higher than before, and Hubei adjusted its count to 1500 higher. We’ll see something like this from the UK in short order."

First of all, the crash was absolutely caused by the pandemic. Other countries, which did not see a yield curve inversion, now project negative growth. Take, for example, the Euro-Area. [Their Yield curve](https://www.ecb.europa.eu/stats/financial_markets_and_interest_rates/euro_area_yield_curves/html/index.en.html) is strictly increasing, yet their [GDP forecasts all show negative growth](https://tradingeconomics.com/euro-area/forecast), though less than the US. How exactly would hundreds of millions of workers not being able to fulfill their jobs at full potential not lead to an economic downturn?  
Furthermore holding up the Yield Curve as a perfect predictor for recessions is dubious. The relationship between yield curve inversions and recessions is poorly understood, and the difference doesn't at all correlate with the length or severity of the recession. Before the pandemic, there was [reasonable thinking that the US might hit a soft landing.](https://www.econlib.org/the-business-cycle-is-dying/)

But let's get to the meat of the comment, the often-made claim that recessions happen about every 10 years. This claim is often made to demonstrate the failure of economics, both here from an Austrian perspective, or also from the left, like when left-wing YouTuber HBomberguy used this argument in a now-deleted Twitter argument with left-wing Twitter user @pseudocia, better known as ironically_edgy, or Liz. This claim is simply false. Looking at [the past recessions](https://www.nber.org/cycles/cyclesmain.html), we can see that in the timespan NBER chronicles, the average time between recessions is 39 months, they sometimes happen as quickly as 3 months, and sometimes took the full 10 years. More importantly, as the Fed has gotten better at market interventions, recessions happened less, counter to the claim by OP that it's the Fed's market interventions that cause recessions."

They tried to bend the curve in 1918 and it worked until the second wave. The more that I look at this whole situation I believe that what they did was just basically to lock down to buy themselves enough time to be able to build up a supply of ventilators gowns gloves and  equipment. Now that they have that happening they’re ready to re-open up and basically you make it you make it you don’t you don’t expect to see the death numbers definitely go up. And then of course the controlled media is going to start to focus on the election and other things and what’s going to happen with coronavirus it’s going to become this five minute update every day. If I remember in the beginning of this they were talking about therapeutics already being developed by now if you notice no one’s talking about the therapeutics anymore.

2020-04-18,atropicalpenguin,PoliticalCompassMemes,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/g2nqak/bustin_makes_me_feel_good/fnr9mwl/,"TL;DR: Some success, some failure. We're not back at square one, but the government is at best dragging its feet to implement it. 

Huh, about that. I can't really give more than a layman appreciation, because it is a very complicated matter. 

So, the right-wing candidate won under the tutelage of the former president, Alvaro Uribe, which was very opposed to the Peace Agreement, since his biggest accomplishment was precisely weakening them enough to bring them to the table, and whose defense minister, Juan Manuel Santos, was then the president that negotiated the agreement. Some people thought that they could just completely crush FARC militarily and just wipe them out. Others thought that the Peace Agreement was giving too many benefits to FARC. They're both debatable, but in the end that was the platform on which we got our new president, Ivan Duque. 

As was to be expected, a fraction of FARC refused to demobilize and took control once again of some former FARC territories that the army and the State had failed to seize in time. Coke plantations are at an all time high, the president will argue that it was due to Santos' end of fumigation (where the herbicide that was used is cancerogenous, although there are a multiplicity of studies and I cannot confirm if it is or not). Santos, of course, will argue that the war against drugs failed and that the reduction during Uribe's period was due as much to the fumigation as it was to the low value of the USD compared to the Colombian peso (which is now in practice 4 times weaker than the USD, whereas under Uribe it was almost 1=1, mostly thanks to the high oil price). [This website goes over the ex FARC mafia that has developed.](https://insightcrime.org/indepth/observatory-rosario/criminal-actors/ex-farc-mafia/)

As for the government and those that demobilized, it's in a grey area. The government has fulfilled some of its promises: some subsidies, a transitional justice system that grants lesser sanctions and privileges the truth (of course this one is really unpopular among a part of the population), but it is also dragging its feet to delay or outright deny some of its promises. 

Consequently, that has increased the rate of people returning to these new FARC dissidences, alongside the ill will of some commanders who never really intended to stop drug trafficking. 

[This article is a good explanation of what the government has done with the agreements, although outdated. Google translate should work fine](https://lasillavacia.com/duque-avanza-lo-basico-del-acuerdo-no-lo-le-da-capital-politico-farc-72843)

Worth talking about the social leaders, which have been targeted and killed by criminal gangs, and which the government has not taken seriously. [There is also this article by the New York Times which denounces that the government has put back pressure on the army to deliver more blows to the dissidences, with no concern on Human Rights, which has lead to false positives](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/18/world/americas/colombian-army-killings.html). An air strike on the dissidences killed recruited children last year, which was one of the main criticisms that protesters had during the big protests of November. It isn't that that hadn't happened before, but there is a lot of bad blood from the activist left (student organizations, unions) that Santos didn't suffer from precisely because these groups wanted to back him up in his peace negotiations. It is also true that this government has been incompetent (the first defence minister openly ignored any of the warnings about false positives, the ambassador to the US asking the US DoJ to free his friend who's in jail for corruption) but has also used embassies and high ranking positions as a way to pay their political allies. It's a mess of a government. 

The coronavirus response has so far been fine, mind you (country lockdown since late March, some subsidies to low income communities) but our inherent inequality and job instability (30-50% of workers don't have contracts, and a big part of those that do have contractor contracts with little to no protection) has had its toll.

EDIT: Kirchner is left-wing, btw, she was really close to Chavez."

Hirses aren't really legal entities. They dont have property, pay taxes, take pensions or hold assets. When a person dies our system has to figure out what to with the persons trailing administrative issues.

We want to figurecout how and why someone to see if there are any issues that we need to be concerned about. Also dead bodies carry disease. Imagine if the coronavirus victims were just buried? Would that cause a wider spread of the disease?

Improperly dispose of bodies rotting into our water supplies will cause disease.

I reckon there's already a number of bodies at your fils local tip. How would authorities tell the difference between the bodies that are there voluntarily and the pnes that are not.

Tips are regularly moved around to aid the rotting process and then reused / build upon. I'm not sure tip workers would be keen to have to also deal with all the dead bodies."

The bipartisan push to get federal-state fiscal relations back on the reform table, comes as Prime Minister Scott Morrison has signalled major changes will be needed to ensure job and income growth.

Victorian Treasurer Tim Pallas wants reforms for how states are funded. AAP

State ministers believe the new collegiality between Canberra and the states – through the national cabinet – could be the opportunity to finally break through decades-long reluctance to reform the revenue imbalance between the states and the Commonwealth.

Victorian Treasurer Tim Pallas on Thursday called out state financing as a key part of broader economic reforms that will be necessary to resuscitate the economy.

His comments came as the Victorian government looks to set up a loan facility worth $24.5 billion to fund recovery projects and programs.

""We will be reforming the way the economy operates, make no mistake about that. We have to do it, the future demands it, Mr Pallas said. ""The way the states derive income needs to be reformed.""

The NSW government is also looking to reform stamp duty as part of a major federal financial review commissioned last year by NSW Treasurer Dominic Perrottet. The review is being led by former Telstra chief David Thodey and includes former New Zealand prime minister Bill English and former federal finance secretary Jane Halton.

Ms Halton is part of Neville Powers' COVID-19 commission making recommendations to the national cabinet on the recovery plan.

""NSW has been putting the case forward for Federation reform for a number of years, and we would support moves by the Prime Minister to look at options to get Australia back on the road to economic strength,"" Mr Perrottet told The Australian Financial Review.

""Now is definitely not a 'business as usual' environment and if reform can enhance our recovery we should look at all the options.

""While the timing of the Federal Financial Relations Review led by David Thodey has naturally been affected by COVID-19, work is ongoing.

""Reform will be a key pillar of the NSW Government’s economic recovery strategy, which is already being developed by NSW Treasury,” Mr Perrottet said.

The distribution of GST would need to be adjusted to cover the transition period. Canberra has shown little appetite for any special coronavirus levy or an increase in the GST.

GST revenues are weakening due to price pressures on retail goods and an increasing spend on GST-free services such as healthcare.

State officials also point out Commonwealth revenues are going to continue being under pressure, with fuel levies likely to fall with the uptake of electric cars and company income tax revenues hit by capital mobility and international tax competition.

Weakening Commonwealth revenues would flow through to lower grant funding to the states.

&#x200B;

Stamp duty a running sore

NSW has estimated the gap between revenue and expenditure will grow to 3.4 per cent of gross state product by 2056, equivalent to $20.6 billion or a fifth of revenues.

The issue of stamp duties has dominated the NSW review, with half the submissions raising issues with it.

""Stamp duty on residential properties are particularly costly as they add to the cost of buying a house and therefore discourage people from downsizing, or moving closer to preferred jobs, schools and family,"" according to the NSW discussion paper.

Half the submissions to the review were about stamp duty. The review has reported it has consistently heard how the transfer duty is a costly tax that affects citizens’ freedom to move through ""the seasons of life"".

""We also heard how it can often have the worst impact on first-home buyers and seniors. By hindering mobility, we heard stories of people living in housing that doesn’t meet their current needs.”

A 2017 NSW Treasury report estimated stamp duty abolition would lead to a 25 per cent increase in property transfers creating the equivalent of an extra 70,000 homes.

Stamp duty is about a quarter of both states' revenues. NSW estimates stamp duty costs the state economy about $2.35 for every collected dollar in lost income, compared with an estimated 16 cent for an annual land tax.

The ACT government has been slowly winding down its stamp duty and replacing it with an annual land tax, in a 20-year program.

Mr Morrison said this week national cabinet has been told by Reserve Bank governor Philip Lowe major economic reforms would be necessary to recover from the COVID-19 global shutdown.

""There was a very clear message from the advisers, particularly Dr Lowe, that if you think we can grow the economy under the old settings then we need to think again,'' he said.

""We are going to have to have economic policy measures that are going to have to be very pro-growth, that are going to enable businesses to employ people, that will enable businesses to invest and businesses to move forward."""

https://imgur.com/a/xcRzpbt

With that as a very rough model, the roughly 2,000 cases in the Nashville metro area today would be just a shadow on the wall revealing closer to 30,000 cases. All of this is reckless speculation, but it's still better than the official numbers. And if people return to their regularly scheduled lives in May, the numbers will explode.

That ratio may not be applicable here; we could be doing better or worse. But the numbers are high enough now that the danger of infection is ready to increase exponentially in the next two months. People at high risk must either become hermits or risk their lives.

> this either goes away as Sars did in '03, which we can't afford to count on, 

SARS didn't go away on its own, it was aggressively contained and stamped out.

> or we survive from herd immunity by either enough people infected and recovered, or a vaccine that's successful. 

There's neither reason to believe that this coronavirus causes permanent immunity (other coronaviruses don't), nor that a vaccine can be developed for it (we have never developed a vaccine for a coronavirus).

> Again, there are no other options for solving this.

The other option is what was done with SARS and what is done with Ebola every time it skips from monkeys to people."

First of all, the premise is wrong. We aren’t currently in a crash, but a purposeful closing of the economy. We also aren’t in a common recession – we are purposefully slowing down our economy to reduce the spread of the coronavirus! This recession currently isn’t bad, it means what we want to accomplish is working (to a large extent).

If this is about the stock market crash, trying to read anything into that is next to impossible as always.

Once the coronavirus problem is solved and we fully re-open the economy (in 2 years?), if the economy then doesn’t come out of recession and grow, we can start to speculate about other things that might be causing it. And then we might start talking about coronavirus breaking a linchpin, being the trigger or the cause or whatever.

Because that’s the other thing that I fear: We are currently putting our economic and political systems through states and changes that they have never seen before at an unprecedented pace.

1. Exponential growth is hard for the brain to comprehend. Imagine a river where the number of frogs double every 2 days. The river only has one frog at first. But gets completely full of frogs in 48 days. How many days did it take to be half full ?24 ? 36 ? Nope . 46 Days. It took 46 days to fill the first half. It then took 2 days to fill the second half. At the peak of growth, the spread of Coronavirus was doubling every two days.For a very long time, it looks like nothing. But when you realise it's getting big, it's already too late. Mix that with the fact that every action you do will have an effect in 2-3 weeks, meanwhile the numbers keep climbing exponentially.It's very easy to see why most humans, leaders AND civilians, were ignoring the disease for a long time, until it exploded and went out of control.
2. Normalcy biais. It's hard to imagine life will be different in the future and not just ""work out"" as it always does. We prefer ignoring things happening right in our door steps, because it's easier for the brain to handle, rather than having to redefine what is normal.
3. Fake news. There's a lot of BS news available everywhere on the social network. Mix that we three different biais : Anchoring bias which means that we tend to believe the first news we get to be right. Availability heuristic bias which means that because we see these news spread a lot, they must be right. Confirmation bias, because by now we already have forged a belief, our brain tend to ignore the existence of things that goes against our belief. This is VERY dangerous. Don't spread BS on social network please, verify your sources before believing AND reposting anything. This is what damages the most the general intelligence of a group. A lot of bullshit media reported that it was just the flu and that it was just like getting a cold, meanwhile reports from italians described it as extremely violent and scary as people are basically drowning from their own fluids for days/weeks before getting better/dying.
4. The fact that western countries haven't had to deal with anything like this for over a century. Made us overly confident and ignored all the people screaming about the fact that we are not prepared to face a pandemic. We are VERY lucky with this virus as it is not as deadly as it could have been. If it was even a little bit worse in terms of death rate, governments would have ceased to be able to function, because we are NOT prepared to deal with this stuff.
5. China obfuscating data.
6. Trump government. The guidelines of the WHO were clear enough that quite a few countries implemented them successfully. To this day, Trump is still not following them. He prefers to save face and cut WHO funding in the middle of a world wide pandemic, instead of even reading and attempting to follow their guidelines. The leaders are the one supposed to be above all these cognitive biaises, understand this shit and lead the people. They completely failed to do that obviously. Not only that, but they participate in the spread of fake news, and thus idiocy."

I was looking around at several different rapid antibody test kits for sale online and one specifically stated: *Positive results may be due to past or present infection with non-SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus strains such as coronavirus HKU1, NL63, OC43, or 229E.*

So there is the potential for these less-reliable test kits to give false positives if you've recently had a viral upper respiratory infection caused by one of the other well-known (non-SARS/MERS) coronavirus...

I’ve failed all normal biologics (Humira, Remicade, Entyvio, Stelara, Cimzia) but am now on the Crohn’s clinical trial for Rinvoq. It’s been approved for RA and is in the works for Crohn’s! I think for UC too! This has given me more relief than anything else I’ve taken over the past 10 years—a literal miracle drug for me.

Before coronavirus, with my GI doc’s blessing and under the care of an endocrinologist, I was about to start weaning below 5mg of pred on May 7 to finally try and get off of it and hopefully start the process of getting my body back to what it used to be... but now I’m afraid the endocrinologist will be worried about messing with my cortisol level during the pandemic. I’m just praying she still thinks it’s safe enough!

Anyway, all this is to say that I’m in the same boat—frustrated with what prednisone has turned my body into and hopeful that my body will do some level of reverting back to normal without me having to change much.

My last longterm stretch on pred before this one, I think it was about a year, I stopped the prednisone around November just before my college break and by January when I went back to school I was the thinnest I’d ever been in my life without doing anything.

But there was a way he might have avoided the trip, his daughter speculated. “If Trump had gone on TV with a mask on and said, ‘Hey this is serious,’ I don’t think he would have gone.”

He left on March 1 (Trump was still telling people to cruise), back on March 14, hospitalized by March 27. So yeah, the cruise headline is a little bit of a red herring, but still.

Gavin Newsom said Saturday, but advocates say the program has been slow and uneven in some areas, hampered by red tape and local opposition.
Appearing at a Motel 6 in Campbell in hard-hit Santa Clara County, Newsom said Saturday that his Project Roomkey has so far secured 10,974 hotel and motel rooms for homeless people and that 4,211 — about 38% — are occupied.

Newsom cited “real progress in just a few weeks to procure these sites to start getting people off the streets, out of the shelters and into these safer settings.”

The governor, who wore a protective face mask as he arrived at the event, also announced that the Motel 6 chain has offered to house homeless people at an additional 47 motels in 19 California counties that have about 5,025 rooms.

Still, he acknowledged that Project Roomkey is facing some obstacles at the local level. Cities, including Laguna Hills in Orange County, are fighting efforts to put homeless people in hotels.

“Cities are blocking these efforts at a time of crisis,” Newsom said without naming any resistant municipalities. “Cities that are blocking those efforts — please consider the morality of those decisions.”

The original goal of the governor’s project was to secure 15,000 rooms throughout California so that homeless people could protect themselves from conditions such as those on the street and in crowded homeless shelters, where the coronavirus can spread.

But the effort is moving too slowly, said Elizabeth A. Mitchell, an attorney for the L.A. Alliance for Human Rights, which last month sued Los Angeles city and county officials to force action."

But experts said they may not prove if someone is protected from reinfection.
The UK's testing co-ordinator has also warned people not to buy private tests.
The government has already paid for three-and-a-half million antibody tests, but has not yet found one that is reliable enough to use - and stresses that it will not approve the use of any test until it is 100% guaranteed.

Professor John Newton said the public should not purchase unapproved antibody tests until a working test is approved.
""We are breaking new ground with this work every day and I am confident this major research effort will make a breakthrough,"" he said of efforts to develop a valid serology test, which measures levels of antibodies in blood plasma.
""Until then, please don't buy or take any unproven tests. They may not be reliable for your intended use; they may give a false reading and put you, your family or others at risk.""
He added: ""As soon as we have found a test that works for this purpose, we will be in a position to roll them out across the country as a back-to-work test.""

Speaking in Geneva, the World Health Organization's (WHO) Dr Maria van Kerkhove cast doubt on the benefit of rapid serology tests due to a lack of evidence around coronavirus immunity.
She said: ""There are a lot of countries that are suggesting using rapid diagnostic serological tests to be able to capture what they think will be a measure of immunity.
""Right now, we have no evidence that the use of a serological test can show that an individual has immunity or is protected from reinfection.""
She added: ""These antibody tests will be able to measure that level of seroprevalence - that level of antibodies but that does not mean that somebody with antibodies means that they are immune.""
Dr van Kerkhove said it was ""a good thing"" that so many tests are being developed, but she added: ""We need to ensure that they are validated so that we know what they say they attempt to measure they are actually measuring.""
Her colleague Dr Michael Ryan said antibody testing also raised ethical questions.
""You might have someone who believes they are seropositive [have been infected] and protected in a situation where they may be exposed and in fact they are susceptible to the disease,"" he said.
The UK announced 847 new coronavirus-related deaths in hospitals in its latest figures on Friday, taking the total to 14,576.

On Friday, Health Secretary Matt Hancock said swab tests - which assess whether someone currently has the coronavirus - will soon be rolled out to other key workers, including police officers, prison staff and firefighters.
He added some 50,000 NHS workers had been tested for the virus so far.
However, he said it was ""frustrating"" there was currently more capacity tests each day than the numbers that were being taken up. On Thursday, 38,000 tests were available but only 21,000 were taken, hence the government's expansion of who will be eligible to be tested.
The government has an overall target of 100,000 tests a day by the end of April."

This means between 2008-2015 + 2017, coronavirus killed more people in two months than the flu killed in 8 years. Which should be a surprise to nobody because we have a vaccine for the flu.

There’s a conspiracy theory that the CDC includes pneumonia with flu numbers because before they started doing it, vaccination numbers were low and people didn’t take the flu seriously. To avoid another 1918 pandemic they bundled them together so people would vaccinate more."

Il semblerait que les mesures prises par Amazon pour protéger les salariés soient des mesures de d'influence sur le comportement et du fliquage.

Beaucoup d'annonces par Amazon, rien de concret a priori en terme de mesures sanitaires. Ce qui explique que la Justice ai donné raison aux Syndicats. Amazon n'a pas mis en place de mesures assez grande pour protéger ses salariés de la propagation du Covid-19. La fermeture est -je l'espère- aussi là pour renfocer/mettre en place les mesures suffisantes. Pourquoi s'en prendre aux syndicats sérieux ? La restrictions aux produits de nécessité va faire qu'ils auront besoin de moins de personnes sur site (10 à 15 fois moins selon un des articles), ce qui du point de vue santé est mieux (moins de gens = moins de chances de propagation) et les autres seront à la même enseigne que la plupart d'entre nous: au chômage partiel. À moins que Amazon ne trouve encore un moyen de magouiller, mais là ils pousseraient le bouchon un peu loin.  


Se comparer aux grandes enseignes de supermarchés etc. c'est con, bien sûr qu'ils vendent de tout, c'est déjà là, tant qu'à faire, ya de risques supplémentaire vu que tu y est déjà pour des trucs essentiels. C'est différent de se faire livrer des trucs non-essentiels par une fourmilière comme Amazon. On peut en revanche se poser des questions quant à la concurrence, peut-être que leurs mesures sont adaptés ? Difficile à savoir, surtout que le gouv bloque les inspecteurs du travail... Forcément, les syndicats sont plus présents dans les grosses entreprise, en l’occurrence la plus grosse du secteur: Amazon, qui concentre 20% des dépenses faites par les clients dans le secteur.

Ensuite on peut en voir qui font des chichis en disant que la qualification de produits de 1ère nécessité est flou... Là c'est juste du foutage de gueule. 1ère nécessité c'est: La bouffe, les médocs, et l'hygiène.  


J'adore la dernière phrase: "" ***""L'activité est suspendue au moins jusqu'à ce lundi inclus. Mais on ne sait pas, dans les faits, quand on va pouvoir reprendre le travail.*** *La salariée précise : ""Dans mon équipe, sur environ 300, on est peut-être 60% à vouloir maintenir le travail.

Il y avait aussi le droit de retrait"", achève-t-elle. ""*  
Là c'est lui/elle qui se permet de parler au nom de 300 personnes, au moins le syndicat il est élu, lui.

Ils savent qu'ils seront remplacés facilement s'ils font des vagues, de nos jours on peut jeter les gens plus facilement qu'avant, ces entreprises calculent qu'elles ont plus à gagner à virer pour faute, sans fondement, même si une petite minorité ira galérer des mois aux prud'hommes, ils économisent plus qu'en payant le chômage à tous. On l'a vu chez Free et Lidl déjà. Et encore, c'est sans compter les CDD qui ne pourraient par être renouvelés, les gens jartés pendant leur période d'essai.

We don’t owe it to him or the Democratic Party to support them in the general election. It is not a moral dilemma. Instead of giving our support to a party whose program we disagree with, we need to build a party of our own, a workers party committed to socialism. The coronavirus crisis is laying bare the contradictions of capitalism and is opening the minds of people to new ideas. Since the crisis began we have seen an uptick in class struggle with workers walking off their jobs to demand better working conditions and workers at General Electric demanding to shift production away from airplane parts to the much-needed ventilators. Health care workers are making national news with their protests against the for-profit health care system. The working class is awake and is becoming increasingly combative.

The states being in bidding wars? What should be done instead? Federal government buy everything and distribute to states? I could see some room for improvement here.. but Trump stated that if states ever came to an issue with the federal government and a state in a bidding war over certain supplies, the Federal government would drop out of the bid for supply in favor of a state. Moreover, Trump (and Kushner) stated in multiple responses to questions that many states were unaware of their current supplies of masks/ventilators/etc.
How could the federal government know these things without the states themselves even knowing?

Keep in mind, this is all within a very short amount of time... I think hindsight is 20/20 and it’s hard to blame Trump for a lot of things here.. his response has been decent imo. You can only move as fast as the data..."

Marriage is a roller coaster. When things are good, they’re great; when things are bad, they fucking suck.

There are long periods of time where I say “this is the best decision I ever made.” There are other times when I say “what man in their right mind would ever willingly do this? This whole 50/50 thing is bullshit. It’s more like 97/3; she controls half the money and ALL the vagina!”

I don’t post enough when things are great, but when they’re bad...reddit is my therapy. Things have sucked for two weeks...this whole Coronavirus is killing marriages, I mean even married people need to breath.

If OP was married (to a woman or man), the same situations would arise. Two people will never get along 100% of the time, especially when both are Type A (yes, we’re both Type A to the core!!!)

This means, once the economy reopens and billions of Americans go back to work -- the virus will be unstoppable. Millions of people will die, and the virus will start spreading to other countries. It will literally, be a worldwide, global pandemic.

The USA has not flattened the curve yet. There are probably hundreds -- thousands of people in each state who have the virus but are asymptomatic. NY is going crazy right now. Florida soon to follow.

We should take advantage of this opportunity by aggressively discrediting China and multinational organizations (both government and non-governmental), there are a few targeted ways that we can do this...

-China is the lynchpin that upholds the globalist left/right alliance, we should be attacking them at every chance we get. Highlight the fact the virus likely escaped a research lab in Wuhan, highlight the issues associated with depending on China for PPE, advocate that increasing domestic manufacturing capacity within your own nations is a matter of national security.

-Aggressively attack the motivation and actions of multinational organizations, using the World Health Organization as an easy jumping off point. Highlight how the corruption and incompetence of the World Health Organization has hindered the response to the virus, and then use this to attack other multinational organizations like the United Nations and EU that prioritize the international community at the expense of nation states. Also use the global dysfunction as an opportunity to discredit non-governmental organizations, particularly those devils advocating for continued mass third world migration during the middle of a pandemic.  One easy target would be the migrant ships run by NGO's that are still attempting to invade European ports during the middle of a pandemic. 

-Most important might be to discredit politicians that are still advocating for the rights of migrants and open borders. Ridicule the state of California for giving every illegal citizen $500, take the opportunity to shame those who advocate for illegal migrants while their own citizens suffer.

>Murphy explained how he “called up” the Cardinal, who is Archbishop of Newark, when the coronavirus pandemic first made its effects felt in mid-March.

>“I said, listen, I’m really concerned about drive-through Holy Communion because we had heard some stories about priests who unwittingly had the virus and unwittingly passed it on to parishioners,” Murphy recounted.

I know the standard idea is: 'Look, there's neither left nor right in the Church. Just Catholic. Everyone is loyal to the God. Just some disagree on a few esoteric particulars.'

But is it also right to give all the outbreaks that I just listed to be called out based on the origin it came from? 

During the time Ebola popped up there was no ""stay at home"" or ""social distancing"" say what you want about Obama and the administration back then. They made sure there was no epidemic in America. Ebola at the time had a 98% fatality rate with no cure. Just think the coronavirus was a 98% fatality tate,was airborne, and no cure. That will cause an extinction of the human species.

2020-04-18,SmoreOfBabylon,Anxiety,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/fnz5n3/coronavirus_discussion_thread/fnrcdu2/,"I feel like what we’re really going to need going forward is some honest, serious risk assessment WRT the virus: how it’s most likely to be transmitted, what acquired immunity looks like, what transmission rates look like with large-scale acquired immunity (full herd immunity is the goal, but even partial immunity among the population will help), what we can really do to protect the most vulnerable populations while allowing others to go about their daily life, and so forth. Currently, a lot of aspects of our response are the result of acting out of an overabundance of caution, because there are many things about this virus that we still don’t fully understand - *right now*. But just bear in mind that there are many thousands of people current working to solve those issues and fill in our knowledge gaps, and our response might look drastically different even a couple of months from now. 

Remember when the WHO/CDC weren’t recommending mask use at all among the general public? Now we’re fairly certain that widespread mask use can potentially be a powerful tool in limiting the spread of the virus. This is an example of something that we’ve come to understand over just the past month. Determining the actual incidence of infections via antibody testing will also be potentially very helpful in deciding on future policy, and we’re getting closer to solving that particular mystery every day. The development of effective treatments could be a huge boon to the most serious patients and the hospitals that treat them.

It’s also worth bearing in mind that the messaging to the public has always been about preparing for the absolute worst-case scenarios. As I saw a psychiatrist put it in a very helpful video that I watched yesterday, fear is a very easy emotion to incite and manipulate in people - in the case of our coronavirus response, the thinking is that it’s easier to scare people into falling in line with a certain mitigation plan than trying to appeal to their reason and personal ability to assess risk. But at a certain point I think we do need to have some serious conversations about which mitigation strategies actually work and which ones might just be overkill. And articles like that one don’t help with that.

Edit: I just re-read the article and I found the author’s insistence that we should follow whatever measures “even if it’s taking a toll on our mental health” to actually be pretty galling. That sounds like something that’s really easy to say if you’ve never had a bout with serious mental illness, but don’t presume that just because *you’ve* resigned to the notion that the current situation just “fucking sucks” and that you’re just going to have to suck it up means that it’s necessarily survivable for everyone mentally."

Unlike the previous design, in which the engines were shown enclosed behind relatively thick-lipped subsonic--type inlets, the AS2 now features axisymmetric spiked, external compression inlets. “I won’t say a lot about what we do with that inlet, but it meets all of the really tough requirements for inlet distortion for engines that try to be all things to all speed regimes,” says Vice. The spike, which shocks the flow down to subsonic speeds for inlet recovery, forms part of what Vice describes as a “quite sophisticated inlet.”


Although Aerion declines to comment, the front of the inlet is thought to include an automatically controlled variable-geometry section. This may be actuated by translating the spike longitudinally to vary the cone ramp angle, thus controlling the flow area and the shock system. Without describing the specific movement of the inlet ring, Vice says only that “if you watch this aircraft go through about Mach 0.4, I think you’d find it quite an interesting ballet.”


He adds: “We really wanted to have an aircraft that was superefficient at Mach 0.95 and superefficient at Mach 1.4, while at the same time minimizing noise. These are not loud [aircraft]. In fact, they meet the most stringent noise rules.” Vice was speaking shortly after the FAA proposed noise certification regulations that, in the case of the AS2, would set a noise limit at the lateral certification measurement point of 96.5 EPNdB, a flyover limit of 94 EPNdB and an approach limit of 100.2 EPNdB.


To minimize noise on takeoff, the proposed rules would allow use of “variable noise reduction systems,” or dynamic systems such as variable geometry inlets. It would also allow for a programmed lapse rate, which the FAA says is “a fully automated feature incorporated into the engine controls as part of the engine thrust rating structure, as a means of reducing noise.”


Work on the Affinity, the world’s first purpose-designed nonafterburning commercial supersonic engine, is meanwhile underway at GE Aviation, where a product design review is scheduled for later in 2020. “We’re working closely on that timeline,” says Brad Mottier, vice president and general manager of business and general aviation and integrated systems for GE Aviation. “This is a real program; it’s not just a paper exercise. We have hundreds of engineers who are assigned to this full-time, and that number is going to probably triple by the end of the year.”


The company, which launched the Affinity in 2017, has completed the initial design review with Aerion and is assessing benchmarking noise data from a “first-of-its-kind acoustic test on an engine to give us the sound reference for a multistage fan design for aeroacoustics and environmental impacts,” says Mottier. “We ultimately have to build this, so we’re also started to engage with our supply chain.”


Citing competitive reasons, GE and Aerion remain deliberately vague over the heritage and architectural details of the core, which Vice describes simply as off-the-shelf. “The reason why I don’t talk about the core is because it is an incredibly high-performance engine that gives us enormous competitive advantage,” he says. “It is also the basis of the first of a family of Affinity engines, and Aerion is going to be the first of a family of supersonic aircraft. And the last thing either Brad [Mottier] or I want is for our competitors to understand what we are really doing.” 


Now thought to be based on a modified version of the high-pressure core of the F110, itself derived from the same F101 core at the heart of the CFM56, the medium-bypass 20,000-lb.-thrust-class Affinity incorporates a new low-pressure system with features not previously seen on any commercial engine. In early renditions, these included a distinctive two-stage fan made up of wide-chord titanium blisks in place of the usual single-stage fan and low-pressure compressor, or booster, found in conventional subsonic engines. Novel features, possibly including a fore-and-aft translating variable geometry system, are also thought to be integrated into the exhaust system to optimize performance and reduce noise.


“Since the end of last year and early this year, we’ve been doing testing on our exhaust system,” says Joel Kirk, advanced systems design and technology leader at GE Aviation. “The work includes acoustic testing and performance testing, as we are trying to optimize those two. There’s obviously a trade there between them, so we are in the process of gathering the data and we’ll continue through midyear. Then we’ll be in a good position to downselect on our exhaust configuration,” he adds.


As part of its push for sustainability Aerion is also designing the AS2 to use 100% alternative jet fuel, rather than a blend. Much of the initial focus for this is at GE. “We’ll be doing combustion testing this summer,” says Kirk. “We’ve already completed a round in February, and we’ll be doing more to show a best-in-class combustion technology.”


Aerion meanwhile aimed to hold an aircraft-level preliminary design review (PDR) in October as part of plans to make first flight in 2024 and debut the AS2 in service in 2026. However, Vice says the COVID-19 pandemic may well change the timeline. “Like every company in the world today, we’re stepping back and taking a hard look at the economic impact of the coronavirus,” he says. “We have a solid liquidity position that takes us well into the middle of next year, even into the fall if necessary, and we are watching closely the volatility and uncertainty in the marketplace.”


The company is also watching the impact on the supply chain. “We’re likely to have to slow things down, and we’re going through that replanning now,” he adds. “But we are on a good solid footing for the overall plan, and we will see what the impact is to the PDR as we get through the next four or five months.”


Aerion has “taken very prudent actions to look at every element of cost,” says Vice. “We’ve cut costs, but the one thing that we will not do is lay people off or furlough. We have built one of the most incredibly talented creative teams, I think, anywhere in the world. And our liquidity position is such that we don’t have to do anything like that. So we’re in good shape. Although there are likely to be some impacts on the program, which will be pushed out, we are very confident that we’ll get through this virus and the economic impacts with it. We’ll come out the other side stronger and get through PDR and get the airplanes delivered.”


Military Option


Aerion is offering a military AS2 derivative dubbed the High-Altitude Supercruise (HASC) platform to serve as a U.S. high-altitude surveillance and eavesdropping aircraft for the Army, Air Force and Navy. The concept includes new capabilities such as a high-altitude testbed platform for a powerful new class of high-energy lasers with power levels of 500 kW or more.


Aerion’s novel approach also cedes ownership of the design to the military. The baseline concept builds on the commercial-certified empennage, engines, wing and centerbody but adds a customized forward fuselage that would house a government-owned mission system and payload, says Stew Miller, Aerion’s executive vice president of strategic systems. Allowing military control of the design, production and sustainment of a fully modular forward fuselage section “changes the model and it empowers the customer,” Miller says. “This is not a [military] modification,” he adds.


Aerion hopes to propose the idea for the Army’s Aerial Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance aircraft program, which seeks to acquire up to 10 modified business jets for the role."

2020-04-18,weissguy3,Coronavirus,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/g3guvj/coronavirus_update_stanford_study_suggests/fnrdf4q/,"I think (and I have no scientific background or evidence to back this up) that it has to do with viral load. I have a feeling that if you are exposed to a person who has a higher viral load, you are more likely to develop similar symptoms. Or if you are at a crowded place (subway, or public transportation in general for example) and are exposed to several people exhibiting mild or no symptoms, the collective accumulation of viral load that you are ingesting can cause a more aggressive course for the virus. 

If someone with no comorbidities is exposed to an asymptomatic person, even for a more prolonged period of time, it may be possible or even likely that no symptoms develop because the viral load is just not sufficient to cause symptoms to happen or for the virus to occur at all.

Example: NBA fans may know Rudy Gobert as sort of the face of Coronavirus after the microphone stunt. Gobert was diagnosed on 3/11 after presenting mild symptoms. He stated that he was ready to play that night and was just awaiting the all clear (which never came) to go to the arena for the game. 2 days prior he played something like 30 minutes against the Toronto Raptors and Serge Ibaka. Despite the fact that they both most likely breathed, touched, and sweated on each other, Ibaka tested negative.

This may be something, or it may be nothing, but even foregoing any sort of scientific training or knowledge, it just seems to me that this could be the case."

> ###Opinion: Sephora Never Valued Workers Like Me

> **I was an ideal employee, but the company treated me terribly, even before it laid me off amid the coronavirus crisis.**

> In late March, I was suddenly laid off from my job at Sephora, where I’d worked part time for almost two years. The announcement came out of nowhere.

> A couple of days before, the company said it would take care of us during the coronavirus crisis, and I believed it. Our stores shut down, but the company started Sephora at Home and asked us to watch videos on new brands so we’d be ready to help people shop online. When corporate announced on a conference call that thousands of part time and seasonal workers were unemployed, it felt like we were cattle led to slaughter.

> I liked working at Sephora. I’ve been writing blog posts about fashion and makeup for years, and I love interacting with customers. I liked how our managers would check in with us about our goals for advancing in the company, and that people in school could get help with college tuition.

> I never really questioned the things that felt unfair in my job. I thought if I worked hard and was flexible, eventually I’d get to full time and better wages. Now I realize I was just drinking the corporate Kool-Aid.

> There are so many part-time workers in retailing, and we’ve always had second-class status, with more unstable schedules and no benefits. Like a third of the hourly workers in the service sector, I was stuck with part-time work even though I wanted more hours.

> The kinds of people who are most likely to be underemployed are Latinas, people paid hourly, people with variable work schedules, people working in sales and retailing and people with low household incomes — all of which describe me. And those of us stuck in part-time jobs are paid 30 percent less per hour than full-timers doing the same thing. That means we face a double penalty: not enough hours, and lower pay for each hour we do work. No wonder I had zero savings when I lost my job.

> The times and lengths of my shifts changed all the time, and sometimes we got our schedules only two days before the week started. I needed as many hours as I could get, so I would always pick up shifts if my co-workers were unavailable. Sometimes I’d work close to 40 hours, but then I’d be cut back, because the manager would get in trouble with corporate if I got too close to full time.

> During my time at Sephora, I had several conversations with my manager about how I could get promoted to full time, and I was told it would happen. But now I think I was just being promised something I was never going to get. I was hired as a cashier, and my manager told me that I was “99 percent ready” to be a lead cashier, but then she hired someone else.

> I worked pretty often in “color matching,” which is helping customers select the right shades of makeup for their skin tone. I was earning $13 an hour, my cashier rate, even when I worked in color matching. I believe my full time co-workers with that job make $15 or $16 per hour, but I’m not sure because the company discouraged us from talking about our wages. One day I got so frustrated I started crying, because I was doing all the work without the benefits that color consultants get, like training and free products.

> And even though I was putting my personal life on hold to come in whenever I was called, that flexibility flowed in only one direction. Once, my car tire blew out and my manager made me feel terrible about calling out, even though I had no way to get to work. Since I had no health benefits or paid time off, I worked when I was unwell. I earned too much money for Medicaid. I have a thyroid condition, which causes a lot of fatigue. And I have really irregular menstruation but haven’t been able to see an obstetrician-gynecologist. When things got really bad, I’d go to the emergency room and ask the hospital to bill me later.

> During the holiday season, I picked up a seasonal job at Target to help make ends meet. But it didn’t help much. Without consistent hours, it’s hard to maintain two jobs. Target wasn’t willing to schedule me around my hours at Sephora, and Sephora gave me a hard time for limiting my availability.

> Then the Target job ended, and Sephora was really slow starting in January. Some weeks I was scheduled for just one shift. I would beg my bosses to call me if anyone called out. By the time the coronavirus hit, I was behind on my bills and afraid my car would get repossessed.

> Sephora offered us one week of severance, but because my hours had been limited, it was only $278. And when I read the fine print, it seemed the money was offered to buy our silence. If I signed it, I couldn’t say anything about how Sephora treated me and other part-time workers, and that didn’t sit right with me. So I didn’t.

> I have been on the phone with every company I owe money to, trying to get some extensions and payment plans. I now have SNAP benefits, but I’ve been calling the unemployment office for more than a month and can’t get through. I wake up at 7 each morning and call all day. It feels like a job I’m not getting paid for. When I try to apply online, I hit problems. Texas allows employers to submit unemployment claims on behalf of all their laid-off workers, and it would be nice if Sephora handled that for us.

> I deserve more than a part-time job where I scramble with unpredictable hours and get tossed aside with no warning. I don’t know what the economy will look like when the pandemic is over, but I know we can’t go back to the way things were."

If we reopen and we don't take the correct precautions, we will get a second wave. The hospital systems can still be overwhelmed if people say ""oh boo hoo"" and don't practice social distancing and proper hygiene. 

At this point in time we are inside to prevent the hospitals from being overwhelmed, which we have been successful with at this point in time. Thus, less people sick and in our hospital system. So in this day and age where we told people to not fly in an airplane, to not drive to see family, to not hold group gatherings. We have proven it is absolutely possible. Albeit at the cost of some economy. 

I don't know about you but even with the hospital system being okay at this point in time, I don't want to get this virus. I don't want the people I care about to get the virus. You might ask ""why not? The can just go to the hospital"". You're absolutely correct. But will they make it out? Will my grandma be okay? Will my family who has asthma be okay? Will my obese cousin survive? Im a healthy individual and I would be ""okay"" if I came down with the Coronavirus. But I absolutely know for certain that some of my family wouldn't be. What about my significant others family? HEAVY smokers for their entire lives. Don't take care of themselves, either. They would be devastated by the virus. You might not have a lot to lose, but some people do."

- Working culture that makes a healthy work/life balance the last priority 

- Lack of financial safety nets for citizens where you’re at the mercy of your employer for whether you’re gonna continue to be employed and get paid enough to survive and the government’s biggest solution is giving everyone $1200 and telling them to have fun and feel confident about spending but also to make it last. The small business payroll relief is already in need of more money but of course there’s squabbling over that.

- Higher sense of individualism and pressure to never slow down. 

- Americans don’t like being told what to do

- Lack of a sense of community/greater division, especially in the current political climate, creating more restlessness as there’s less of a feeling of “we’re all in this together so let’s make this work” and instead more arguing about what everyone thinks we should do. This is intensified thanks to the amount of misleading information out there about the virus and how we love to pick and choose the information and sources that best fit our narrative. 

- Coronavirus does not have a beard or wear a turban nor taken the form of street drugs and thus is an invisible (to the naked eye) killer of thousands of Americans so we can’t put it on a poster and rally ourselves together to declare a war on it."

There was a first wave of the Spanish Flu that was thought to be just an extremely aggressive form of the seasonal flu.  Soldiers brought it to the battlegrounds of the first World War, where Spain was the first one to actually report on it and say 'hey, maybe this is a problem', at which point the disease was named after them.  The time honored principle of He who smelt it, dealt it.

Anyway, back home we had done the social distancing thing.  Closed down schools, businesses, public places, ect.  And for the most part it worked.  Cases dropped.  But off at war, the virus has mutated in the dark, cramped confines of the trenches and bunkers, and our boys brought it home with them.

When they got home, Philadelphia threw them a big 'social distancing is over forever' party.  200,000 people turned up for a gigantic parade and the mutated super Spanish Flu was the gift bag.  This sort of cavalier attitude toward transmission led to a huge spike in cases and deaths.  Especially when compared to St. Louis, who were going to have a similar parade but then realized 'aren't we still in the middle of a pandemic?', and so they cancelled.

The second wave was a massive spike.  In October 1918, 200,000 people died in the US.  To put that in prospective, 115,000 American soldiers died in all of WW1.

This was also a third wave after that, but fortunately in failed to spread quite as much.  Still killed *a lot* of people, but not *as many* people.

Point being, we are currently in the first wave of the Coronavirus.  And rushing back out to continue our normal lives without taking proper precautions is definitely going to result in a second wave which is certain to be a bigger hit to our medical system than the first.

So let's not do that.

Stay home, stay safe.  Wash your hands.  Practice social distancing.  And don't be dumb."

###Tips For Social Distancing, Quarantine, And Isolation During An Infectious Disease Outbreak

**What Is Social Distancing?**

Social distancing is a way to keep people from interacting closely or frequently enough to spread an infectious disease. Schools and other gathering places such as movie theaters may close, and sports events and religious services may be cancelled.

**What Is Quarantine?**

Quarantine separates and restricts the movement of people who have been exposed to a contagious disease to see if they become sick. It lasts long enough to ensure the person has not contracted an infectious disease.

**What Is Isolation?**

Isolation prevents the spread of an infectious disease by separating people who are sick from those who are not. It lasts as long as the disease is contagious.

##What To Expect: Typical Reactions

Everyone reacts differently to stressful situations such as an infectious disease outbreak that requires social distancing, quarantine, or isolation. People may feel:

- **Anxiety, worry, or fear related to**:  
- Your own health status  
- The health status of others whom you may have exposed to the disease  
- The resentment that your friends and family may feel if they need to go into quarantine as a result of contact with you  
- The experience of monitoring yourself, or being monitored by others for signs and symptoms of the disease  
- Time taken off from work and the potential loss of income and job security  
- The challenges of securing things you need, such as groceries and personal care items  
- **Concern** about being able to effectively care for children or others in your care  
- **Uncertainty or frustration** about how long you will need to remain in this situation, and uncertainty about the future  
- **Loneliness** associated with feeling cut off from the world and from loved ones  
- **Anger** if you think you were exposed to the disease because of others’ negligence  
- **Boredom and frustration** because you may not be able to work or engage in regular day-to-day activities  
- **Uncertainty or ambivalence** about the situation  
- **A desire** to use alcohol or drugs to cope  
- **Symptoms of depression**, such as feelings of hopelessness, changes in appetite, or sleeping too little or too much  
- **Symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD)**, such as intrusive distressing memories, flashbacks (reliving the event), nightmares, changes in thoughts and mood, and being easily startled.

##Ways To Support Yourself During Social Distancing, Quarantine, and Isolation

#UNDERSTAND THE RISK

Consider the real risk of harm to yourself and others around you. The public perception of risk during a situation such as an infectious disease outbreak is often inaccurate. Media coverage may create the impression that people are in immediate danger when really the risk for infection may be very low. Take steps to get the facts:

- Stay up to date on what is happening, while limiting your media exposure. Avoid watching or listening to news reports 24/7 since this tends to increase anxiety and worry. Remember that children are especially affected by what they hear and see on television.  
- Look to credible sources for information on the infectious disease outbreak.

#BE YOUR OWN ADVOCATE

Speaking out about your needs is particularly important if you are in quarantine, since you may not be in a hospital or other facility where your basic needs are met. Ensure you have what you need to feel safe, secure, and comfortable.

- Work with local, state, or national health officials to find out how you can arrange for groceries and toiletries to be delivered to your home as needed.  
- Inform health care providers or health authorities of any needed medications and work with them to ensure that you continue to receive those medications.

#EDUCATE YOURSELF

Health care providers and health authorities should provide information on the disease, its diagnosis, and treatment.

- Do not be afraid to ask questions—clear communication with a health care provider may help reduce any distress associated with social distancing, quarantine, or isolation.  
- Ask for written information when available.  
- Ask a family member or friend to obtain information in the event that you are unable to secure this information on your own.

#WORK WITH YOUR EMPLOYER TO REDUCE FINANCIAL STRESS

If you’re unable to work during this time, you may experience stress related to your job status or financial situation.

- Provide your employer with a clear explanation of why you are away from work.  
- Contact the U.S. Department of Labor tollfree at 1-866-487-2365 about the Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA), which allows U.S. employees up to 12 weeks of unpaid leave for serious medical conditions, or to care for a family member with a serious medical condition.  
- Contact your utility providers, cable and Internet provider, and other companies from whom you get monthly bills to explain your situation and request alternative bill payment arrangements as needed.

#CONNECT WITH OTHERS

Reaching out to people you trust is one of the best ways to reduce anxiety, depression, loneliness, and boredom during social distancing, quarantine, and isolation. You can:

- Use the telephone, email, text messaging, and social media to connect with friends, family, and others.  
- Talk “face to face” with friends and loved ones using Skype or FaceTime.  
- If approved by health authorities and your health care providers, arrange for your friends and loved ones to bring you newspapers, movies, and books.  
- Sign up for emergency alerts via text or email to ensure you get updates as soon as they are available.  
- Call SAMHSA’s free 24-hour Disaster Distress Helpline at 1-800-985-5990, if you feel lonely or need support.  
- Use the Internet, radio, and television to keep up with local, national, and world events.  
- If you need to connect with someone because of an ongoing alcohol or drug problem, consider calling your local Alcoholics Anonymous or Narcotics Anonymous offices.

#TALK TO YOUR DOCTOR

If you are in a medical facility, you may have access to health care providers who can answer your questions. However, if you are quarantined at home, and you’re worried about physical symptoms you or your loved ones may be experiencing, call your doctor or other health care provider:

- Ask your provider whether it would be possible to schedule remote appointments via Skype or FaceTime for mental health, substance use, or physical health needs.

#USE PRACTICAL WAYS TO COPE AND RELAX

- Relax your body often by doing things that work for you-take deep breaths, stretch, meditate or pray, or engage in activities you enjoy.  
- Pace yourself between stressful activities, and do something fun after a hard task.  
- Talk about your experiences and feelings to loved ones and friends, if you find it helpful.  
- Maintain a sense of hope and positive thinking; consider keeping a journal where you write down things you are grateful for or that are going well

> 
> Conservative activists are demanding governors lift orders designed to stop the spread of the coronavirus, despite the recommendations of public health officials. Trump, who has clashed with Democratic governors over how soon to reopen the US economy, tweeted his support on Friday, in an unprecedented endorsement of civil disobedience by a sitting president.
> 
> Many of the planned rallies have been inspired by a protest at the Michigan state capitol on Wednesday, which was attended by thousands.

> Flu vaccines are less than 50% effective some years. 

The flu and this are completely different beasts. Flu mutates much faster and has multiple strains; the effectiveness is limited by wrong predictions about which strain will hit.

> We've still never managed to make a vaccine for sars 1 since 2002.

They were managing. But then they lost their funding because hey, who cares about this coronavirus, it's not like another that's very similar will ever come around. Many of the COVID vaccine prototypes are just modified SARS vaccines prototypes.

> There is mounting evidence from multiple, albeit very small, serological studies suggesting the number of infections is upwards of 30x the confirmed cases.

Deaths are undercounted too.

I say it won't, wanna bet? Also anyway we already can see that healthcare systems get overwhelmed as things are.

It is absolutely unlike any of those. You're crazy if you think somehow the entire world deluded itself into thinking this was more dangerous despite everyone wanting very hard to believe it was nothing.

That number multiplied by several drcades documented and known flu infection fatality rate from US and EU countries which is 0.1%. and that divided by 365. You get around 9k people death each day. 


Coronavirus is the same except that range in population is bigger 30-70% and that infection fatality is not 0.1% but 0.3%. So around 40k average deaths each day is to be expected."

Switzerland’s Matterhorn lit up with American flag, messages of hope during coronavirus crisis
Trending

Posted: Apr 17, 2020 / 10:12 PM CDT	/ Updated: Apr 17, 2020 / 10:12 PM CDT	

(CNN) — Switzerland’s famed Matterhorn mountain was illuminated with an American flag for a few hours as a symbol of solidarity during the coronavirus pandemic.

“Our thoughts are with all American people at this unprecedented time. We look forward to meeting again at the foot of the Matterhorn, we are all in this together,” the tourism organization Zermatt Matterhorn wrote on its Facebook page.
Switzerland’s famed Matterhorn mountain was illuminated with an American flag for a few hours as a symbol of solidarity during the coronavirus pandemic.

Light artist Gerry Hofstetter projected the flag onto the 14,692 foot tall peak in the Swiss Alps as part of a nightly series designed to show the town of Zermatt’s support for everyone suffering and those fighting the pandemic.

Hofstetter is known for projecting images onto landmarks to create temporary art installations. He shined a full-sized image of the Titanic onto a huge Antarctic iceberg in 2012 to mark the 100th anniversary of the ship’s sinking.

He’s been lighting up the Matterhorn with different imageseach  day since March 24. The American flag was projected late Wednesday.

The mountain has been lit up with the flags of Japan, Germany, the United Kingdom, France, Italy and others in recent weeks along with the hashtags #hope and #allofus.

The popular tourist destination also projected messages encouraging people to stay home and guests to “Dream now — Travel later.”

“We know that you are longing to visit us. Soon we can meet again. For the moment, however, health is our priority,” Zermatt Matterhorn wrote on its website. “But dreaming is not prohibited. We support you with great pictures in this travel-free time and send you our best wishes from the Matterhorn.

They’ve set up webcams, so would-be visitors can watch the displays from home."

[**Kieran Corcoran**](https://www.businessinsider.com/author/kieran-corcoran)

A WHO tweet downplaying the dangers of the coronavirus was posted by a mid-ranking official who wanted to keep China happy, [according to a report by the Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/18/caught-in-a-superpower-struggle-the-inside-story-of-the-whos-response-to-coronavirus).

The message was posted on January 14, and says that there is ""no clear evidence"" that the coronavirus beginning to sweep Wuhan, China, was capable of spreading directly between humans.

In the days that followed the tweet, it [became clear that human-to-human transmission was indeed possible](https://www.businessinsider.com/deadly-china-wuhan-virus-spreading-human-to-human-officials-confirm-2020-1?r=US&IR=T).

The message has been cited in dozens of articles dissecting the WHO's early response to the pandemic, and is widely quoted on social media as an unusually clear example of advice that is unambiguously wrong in hindsight.

 It emerged this week that by January 14, officials in China [already knew that the virus could spread between people — and would likely become a pandemic](https://www.businessinsider.com/coronavirus-china-hid-pandemic-news-six-days-2020-4). They waited for a further six days before making that information public. 

However, even without that information, some in the WHO were warning of the danger of a rapid spread.

They include the US expert Dr Maria Van Kerkhove, [who on January 14 warned that ""we need to prepare ourselves""](https://www.reuters.com/article/china-health-pneumonia-who/who-says-new-china-virus-could-spread-its-warning-all-hospitals-idUSL8N29F48F) for the possibility of mass human transmission.

And, according to [a new report by Julian Borger of the Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/18/caught-in-a-superpower-struggle-the-inside-story-of-the-whos-response-to-coronavirus), it was internal WHO discomfort with these warnings that prompted the ""no clear transmission"" tweet.

Borger wrote:

""\[The tweet\] was issued on the same day the WHO's technical lead on Covid-19, Maria Van Kerkhove (a US immunologist) gave a press briefing in Geneva warning of precisely the opposite — the potential for rapid spread.

""Concerned that her briefing conflicted with the initial Chinese findings, a middle-ranking official told the social media team to put out a tweet to balance the Van Kerkhove briefing.""

The article goes on to note that the tweet ""does not appear to have been part of a deliberate strategy"" to appease China.

Critics of the WHO, however, have seen a broader pattern of deference.

[Emily Ruahala of The Washington Post this week reported comments](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/trumps-critique-of-who-may-be-a-diversion-but-it-resonates-beyond-the-white-house/2020/04/15/c3320360-7b30-11ea-a311-adb1344719a9_story.html) by public health experts, as well as lawmakers in Germany and Japan, criticizing the WHO's closeness to China.

The most extreme criticism has come from President Donald Trump, who called the WHO ""very China-centric"" in a coronavirus news conference and said he would halt US funding to the body, worth some $400 million per year.

Business Insider has contacted the WHO for comment."

Those are numbers that were gathered over decades. This means that  2-3 millions people die each year. Coronavirus infection fatality rate is 0.3% based on indiscriminate antibody random testing from European countries with older population averages. And it is projected to hit 30%-70% (worst case) of global population. So yes up to 20 million people globally is expected to die. 20 million deaths globally is completely irrelevant number if you look at global population and the whole point I made was. Why those 20 million deaths from disease suddenly matter more than other 100s of millions that die of starvation, in war, other diseases w.e. why do you suddenly care so much about completely insignificant number of deaths compared to global population?

###Tips For Social Distancing, Quarantine, And Isolation During An Infectious Disease Outbreak

**What Is Social Distancing?**

Social distancing is a way to keep people from interacting closely or frequently enough to spread an infectious disease. Schools and other gathering places such as movie theaters may close, and sports events and religious services may be cancelled.

**What Is Quarantine?**

Quarantine separates and restricts the movement of people who have been exposed to a contagious disease to see if they become sick. It lasts long enough to ensure the person has not contracted an infectious disease.

**What Is Isolation?**

Isolation prevents the spread of an infectious disease by separating people who are sick from those who are not. It lasts as long as the disease is contagious.

##What To Expect: Typical Reactions

Everyone reacts differently to stressful situations such as an infectious disease outbreak that requires social distancing, quarantine, or isolation. People may feel:

- **Anxiety, worry, or fear related to**:  
- Your own health status  
- The health status of others whom you may have exposed to the disease  
- The resentment that your friends and family may feel if they need to go into quarantine as a result of contact with you  
- The experience of monitoring yourself, or being monitored by others for signs and symptoms of the disease  
- Time taken off from work and the potential loss of income and job security  
- The challenges of securing things you need, such as groceries and personal care items  
- **Concern** about being able to effectively care for children or others in your care  
- **Uncertainty or frustration** about how long you will need to remain in this situation, and uncertainty about the future  
- **Loneliness** associated with feeling cut off from the world and from loved ones  
- **Anger** if you think you were exposed to the disease because of others’ negligence  
- **Boredom and frustration** because you may not be able to work or engage in regular day-to-day activities

##Ways To Support Yourself During Social Distancing, Quarantine, and Isolation

#UNDERSTAND THE RISK

Consider the real risk of harm to yourself and others around you. The public perception of risk during a situation such as an infectious disease outbreak is often inaccurate. Media coverage may create the impression that people are in immediate danger when really the risk for infection may be very low. Take steps to get the facts:

- Stay up to date on what is happening, while limiting your media exposure. Avoid watching or listening to news reports 24/7 since this tends to increase anxiety and worry. Remember that children are especially affected by what they hear and see on television.  
- Look to credible sources for information on the infectious disease outbreak.

#BE YOUR OWN ADVOCATE

Speaking out about your needs is particularly important if you are in quarantine, since you may not be in a hospital or other facility where your basic needs are met. Ensure you have what you need to feel safe, secure, and comfortable.

- Work with local, state, or national health officials to find out how you can arrange for groceries and toiletries to be delivered to your home as needed.  
- Inform health care providers or health authorities of any needed medications and work with them to ensure that you continue to receive those medications.

#EDUCATE YOURSELF

Health care providers and health authorities should provide information on the disease, its diagnosis, and treatment.

- Do not be afraid to ask questions—clear communication with a health care provider may help reduce any distress associated with social distancing, quarantine, or isolation.  
- Ask for written information when available.  
- Ask a family member or friend to obtain information in the event that you are unable to secure this information on your own.

#WORK WITH YOUR EMPLOYER TO REDUCE FINANCIAL STRESS

If you’re unable to work during this time, you may experience stress related to your job status or financial situation.

- Provide your employer with a clear explanation of why you are away from work.  
- Contact the U.S. Department of Labor tollfree at 1-866-487-2365 about the Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA), which allows U.S. employees up to 12 weeks of unpaid leave for serious medical conditions, or to care for a family member with a serious medical condition.  
- Contact your utility providers, cable and Internet provider, and other companies from whom you get monthly bills to explain your situation and request alternative bill payment arrangements as needed.

#CONNECT WITH OTHERS

Reaching out to people you trust is one of the best ways to reduce anxiety, depression, loneliness, and boredom during social distancing, quarantine, and isolation. You can:

- Use the telephone, email, text messaging, and social media to connect with friends, family, and others.  
- Talk “face to face” with friends and loved ones using Skype or FaceTime.  
- If approved by health authorities and your health care providers, arrange for your friends and loved ones to bring you newspapers, movies, and books.  
- Sign up for emergency alerts via text or email to ensure you get updates as soon as they are available.  
- Call SAMHSA’s free 24-hour Disaster Distress Helpline at 1-800-985-5990, if you feel lonely or need support.  
- Use the Internet, radio, and television to keep up with local, national, and world events.  
- If you need to connect with someone because of an ongoing alcohol or drug problem, consider calling your local Alcoholics Anonymous or Narcotics Anonymous offices.

#TALK TO YOUR DOCTOR

If you are in a medical facility, you may have access to health care providers who can answer your questions. However, if you are quarantined at home, and you’re worried about physical symptoms you or your loved ones may be experiencing, call your doctor or other health care provider:

- Ask your provider whether it would be possible to schedule remote appointments via Skype or FaceTime for mental health, substance use, or physical health needs.

#USE PRACTICAL WAYS TO COPE AND RELAX

- Relax your body often by doing things that work for you-take deep breaths, stretch, meditate or pray, or engage in activities you enjoy.  
- Pace yourself between stressful activities, and do something fun after a hard task.  
- Talk about your experiences and feelings to loved ones and friends, if you find it helpful.  
- Maintain a sense of hope and positive thinking; consider keeping a journal where you write down things you are grateful for or that are going well

Most Indians have never been to North-East India and very little about their culture and history is taught at school. And people who don't attend school don't even know their existence.

But unfortunately, ignorance is not the only reason for discrimination. Sometimes it's condescension; other times it's just vicious hatred for ""others"".

I don't think trying to find a scapegoat for the current crisis is the reason for racism; it's something inherently and deeply etched into the society that's being manifested because of the pandemic because it's obvious racism won't go away with the coronavirus."

>Cutting taxes on the rich during a bull market, exacerbating the national debt at exactly the wrong time (you want to be fiscally restrained in the market upswing so that you can have higher spending during the market downturn).

After Ive heard from people that prepare tax returns for ""the rich"" is that it's not so clear cut. Forbes also did an article:

 

*Hence, TCJA was progressive as conventionally defined. The rich  received less than a proportionate share of TCJA’s total tax cut. The  very poor benefited even though they pay negative net taxes.*

*These figures may well understate the progressivity of TCJA. Our  analysis assumes that the share owners of U.S. companies (most rich  Americans) bear the burden of the U.S. corporate income tax.*

>Reneging on the Iran deal, unilaterally sanctioning them, and assassinating their top general.

 From the Guardian:

The first deployment of a drone as an assassination tool was ordered  by Bill Clinton in an effort to get Bin Laden. The first successful  “targeted killing”, as it is now called, came soon after, carried out by  the Bush administration in Yemen.

Obama inherited Bush’s widespread use of drone killings and [increased their frequency tenfold](https://www.thebureauinvestigates.com/stories/2017-01-17/obamas-covert-drone-war-in-numbers-ten-times-more-strikes-than-bush), while seeking to give them a veneer of legal respectability with the secret internal “[targeted killing memos](https://www.nytimes.com/2014/05/21/us/politics/memo-approving-targeted-killing-of-us-citizen-to-be-released.html)”.  Those documents argued that drone assassinations were justified under  international law as self-defense against future terrorist attacks – a  rationale that has been widely disputed as a misreading of the UN  charter.

>Abruptly abandoning Syrian Kurdistan after a phone call with Erdogan without so much as informing our Kurdish allies about our intentions prior.

&#x200B;

Maybe - though because Trump is hated by everyone he is also a great excuse to *claim* no-one was consulted. The USA abandoned the Kurds after the 1991 Gulf War (after giving them the impression they would get help to topple Saddam. The USA abandoned Saddam after the Kuwait invasion before that he got lots of $$$ - so I don't see this as much of  a change from US business as usual.

Why is the US even in Syria? Looking after Saudi interests - and that came about waaayy before Trump.

Realpolitik  -

>Blackmail US governors into praising him/not criticizing him or else they wouldn’t get ventilators/PPE from the federal government during the coronavirus crisis.

Agree, Trump is a jerk there. Though funny how the media was criticizing his ""racist"" Chinese travel ban in (February?).

&#x200B;

Don't misunderstand - I hate the dumb, self-agrandising Trump - but I hate the media intellectual dishonesty that has arisen in his wake.

FWIW I really wish Tulsi Gabbard or Warren where the D nominees!

TBH strategically I think that the Dems are now at a stage where they actually want to loose the presidential election - in order to get the House and the Senate.

The next 4 years are going to suck economically - so why would the Dems want to get lumbered with that?"

2020-04-18,pokemaniacaus,CoronavirusDownunder,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoronavirusDownunder/comments/g3hm6b/data_supports_full_return_of_school/fnrxht8/,"Fewer than 180 children have caught COVID-19 in Australia, in line with international trends suggesting that children have a much lower incidence of infection. 
So far in Australia, fewer than 1 per cent of COVID-19 cases have been children under the age of 10.
Paediatric research teams in Melbourne and Perth will be the first in Australia to investigate what role children play in the transmission of COVID-19, and whether they have fewer symptoms than adults.

Researchers from Murdoch Children’s Research Institute in Melbourne and Telethon Kids ­Institute in Perth say the current ­evidence suggests children are not a major driver of coronavirus transmission in the community.
But by investigating cases that present to hospitals, the teams will track whether the child got infected by adults or vice versa, and if the child’s symptoms were milder or even absent altogether.

A seven-week-old baby was among 29 new coronavirus cases in NSW on Friday. The child was a close contact of a family member who tested positive. Neither has been admitted to hospital.
The youngest confirmed ­patient in Western Australia is a five-month-old baby whose parents both tested positive.
Lead researcher at MCRI Nigel Crawford said the population of 18 years or under among COVID 19-infected patients was lower than with other infections. “But we did see the same thing with SARS, which also seemed to affect older people.”
He said data from the US identified 2500 paediatric cases of COVID-19, which was less than 2 per cent despite children being 22 per cent of the population.
“The question is whether they are still being affected but not being identified. We know some of the children didn’t necessarily have all the clear signs that appear in adults,” he said.
Australian Health Department figures show low numbers of COVID-19 cases in babies and children up to four years old, and those aged 10 to 14. They have had 43 and 48 cases respectively, which is just 0.7 per cent of cases.
Children between five and nine ­appear even less susceptible, with the lowest number in any age group — 28, or just 0.4 per cent. The incidence rises sharply among 15 to 19-year-olds, with 141 — or 2.2 per cent — of all cases.
However, the numbers multiply nearly fivefold among young adults 20 to 24, with 627 cases, or 9.7 per cent. It exceeds that age group’s representation in the total population, which is 6.9 per cent.
Australians aged 80 to 84 have 120 cases, or 1.9 per cent of all cases, with fewer among those over 85 — with 78, or 1.2 per cent.
Research teams in Melbourne and Perth will examine the child cases for household or other transmission. “Sometimes it’s the parents that get infected, and usually it’s the parent infecting the child,” Professor Crawford said.
There have been almost no outbreaks in schools, but the ­research will shed light on what happens in schools as they reopen in the months to come.
“We’ve got a window of time and some real expertise,” he said. “There’s a possibility that Australia can really add to knowledge around the paediatric population.”
Associate professor Chris Blyth, from Telethon Kids Institute, said international data suggested children were not falling ill as frequently as adults.
“I truly believe children probably are getting infected but are just not getting as unwell,” he said.
“School closures are one of the interventions we have least evidence to support … I believe they ­are one of the first things we should think about winding back.”"

Talking to media during his daily White House briefing on the coronavirus outbreak, Trump said that America wants to be open and that a national shutdown is not a sustainable long-term solution.
Asserting that a prolonged lockdown, combined with a forced economic depression, would inflict an immense and wide-ranging toll on public health, Trump said that his administration is issuing new federal guidelines that will allow governors to take a phased approach to reopening their individual states.
For the first phase, the guidelines recommends that states see a downward trajectory for 14 days in the number of confirmed coronavirus cases before they move to lift stay-at-home orders and other restrictions. The second phase includes asking for all vulnerable individuals to shelter in place, encourage telework, closure of common areas and physical distancing.
The third phase is essentially returning to the new normal with better hygiene practices, and respect for spaces between individuals."

It's recommended to read both articles to get a balanced viewpoint.

Here's relevant quote from the original news:

>The WHO also provided ammunition to its detractors when, on 14 January, it put out [a tweet](https://twitter.com/WHO/status/1217043229427761152?s=20) citing preliminary Chinese studies finding “no clear evidence of human-to-human transmission”.

Concerned that her briefing conflicted with the initial Chinese findings, a middle-ranking official told the social media team to put out a tweet to balance the Van Kerkhove briefing. In so doing, the WHO exposed itself to the charge of contributing to an air of complacency. But the tweet was factually true and does not appear to have been part of a deliberate strategy.

[**Kieran Corcoran**](https://www.businessinsider.com/author/kieran-corcoran)

A WHO tweet downplaying the dangers of the coronavirus was posted by a mid-ranking official who wanted to keep China happy, [according to a report by the Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/18/caught-in-a-superpower-struggle-the-inside-story-of-the-whos-response-to-coronavirus).

The message was posted on January 14, and says that there is ""no clear evidence"" that the coronavirus beginning to sweep Wuhan, China, was capable of spreading directly between humans.

In the days that followed the tweet, it [became clear that human-to-human transmission was indeed possible](https://www.businessinsider.com/deadly-china-wuhan-virus-spreading-human-to-human-officials-confirm-2020-1?r=US&IR=T).

The message has been cited in dozens of articles dissecting the WHO's early response to the pandemic, and is widely quoted on social media as an unusually clear example of advice that is unambiguously wrong in hindsight.

It emerged this week that by January 14, officials in China [already knew that the virus could spread between people — and would likely become a pandemic](https://www.businessinsider.com/coronavirus-china-hid-pandemic-news-six-days-2020-4). They waited for a further six days before making that information public.

However, even without that information, some in the WHO were warning of the danger of a rapid spread.

They include the US expert Dr Maria Van Kerkhove, [who on January 14 warned that ""we need to prepare ourselves""](https://www.reuters.com/article/china-health-pneumonia-who/who-says-new-china-virus-could-spread-its-warning-all-hospitals-idUSL8N29F48F) for the possibility of mass human transmission.

And, according to [a new report by Julian Borger of the Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/18/caught-in-a-superpower-struggle-the-inside-story-of-the-whos-response-to-coronavirus), it was internal WHO discomfort with these warnings that prompted the ""no clear transmission"" tweet.

Borger wrote:

""\[The tweet\] was issued on the same day the WHO's technical lead on Covid-19, Maria Van Kerkhove (a US immunologist) gave a press briefing in Geneva warning of precisely the opposite — the potential for rapid spread.

""Concerned that her briefing conflicted with the initial Chinese findings, a middle-ranking official told the social media team to put out a tweet to balance the Van Kerkhove briefing.""

The article goes on to note that the tweet ""does not appear to have been part of a deliberate strategy"" to appease China.

Critics of the WHO, however, have seen a broader pattern of deference.

[Emily Ruahala of The Washington Post this week reported comments](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/trumps-critique-of-who-may-be-a-diversion-but-it-resonates-beyond-the-white-house/2020/04/15/c3320360-7b30-11ea-a311-adb1344719a9_story.html) by public health experts, as well as lawmakers in Germany and Japan, criticizing the WHO's closeness to China.

The most extreme criticism has come from President Donald Trump, who called the WHO ""very China-centric"" in a coronavirus news conference and said he would halt US funding to the body, worth some $400 million per year.

Business Insider has contacted the WHO for comment."

On that logic it's impossible to call *anything* racist.

But motives don't even matter here. If you use explicitly racist abuse to attack a stranger, even if it's purely because you think that's the best way to hurt them, *that's still a racist act*.

Concerns about media brewing up racial divisions are legitimate. You could say: ""Lots of violent attacks happen in the city, and when the media picks out only the racist ones for attention it exaggerates racial divisions and ironically makes racial antagonism more likely."" But trying to argue that this overtly racist attack was maybe somehow not racist - and that there's a lack of evidence about ""who is at fault"" when we have both video and testimony of one person cowering in the fetal position while the other drags her around by the hair and kicks her repeatedly in the chest - is not it."

I'm not sure what they based it on, but I trust they know what they're doing - it's a bloody good uni. Only 0.4% of the population has been confirmed to have (had) it, meaning that there's almost forty times as many people thought to have had it without realising, therefore being either totally or almost asymptomatic.  This puts it at being worse than a flu, but, given the fact that almost all deaths occur in vulnerable people (i.e. over 60, or with heart or lung disease or diabetes) total collapse of society is, in my opinion, an overreaction. We need to pump lots of resources into protecting vulnerable people (this includes both of my parents and my only living grandparent, so I am thinking about this - all of whom live in the UK where the fatality rate is considerably higher) and yes, the (Spanish) government which calls itself socialist is going to have to pay a massive amount of money to do this - I'm talking the posh masks for all vulnerable people (and they still haven't even managed to sort out the healthcare worker situation), and taking some basic precautions like compulsory (surgical) mask wearing for everyone, limiting large groups but still allowing people to fucking leave the house etc.   
  
I've done some back of the envelope calculations and, assuming (possibly incorrectly) that people of all ages have at least comparable chance of exposure, the true fatality rate in under 60s (still including people with the aforementioned health problems) is about 0.02%. I assume that the amount of people with even just type 1 diabetes is about that, so actually it sounds like even some vulnerable young people are able to fight it off thanks to still having an immune system that works decently, even if other parts of their body don't. 
  
The official mortality rate here is about 10%, but obviously once you divide that by 40 its a much nicer looking 0.25%. 
 
They're really short on tests here - I was suspected to have an unusual case of coronavirus (my temperature was low instead of high, and I only had digestive symptoms - but the doctors said as they had no other explanation for my symptoms they could only assume it was coronavirus as they still don't know much about it and its thought that about 10% of symptomatic patients do also have digestive symptoms) and although I had to go to the doctors three times (I was incapable of hydrating myself without immediately vomiting more than what I'd just drunk) I never got tested, because I was still breathing fine."

For weeks Japan has limited its testing for the coronavirus, which emerged in neighbouring China late last year, despite calls from many health experts who see testing as vital to detecting and isolating cases and slowing the spread.
Japan conducted about 52,000 polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests in March, or just 16% of the number carried out in South Korea, according to data from Oxford University.
Experts say Japan’s strategy of keeping the number of PCR tests low has made it difficult to trace the disease as it spread in Tokyo and other big cities and led to a wave of in-hospital infections, crippling some facilities.
The decision to expand testing came as Prime Minister Shinzo Abe this week expanded a state of emergency, originally issued for Tokyo and six other areas, to the entire country, and warned of the growing burden on health facilities.

2020-04-18,williambotter,brasilnoticias,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/brasilnoticias/comments/g3l5ua/menos_da_metade_dos_adultos_brasileiros_adota/fnrwdqd/," Menos de metade da população adulta do país adota todas as medidas ideais de prevenção ao novo coronavírus, como evitar aglomerações, manter o distanciamento de pessoas com sintomas, lavar frequentemente as mãos e adotar práticas de ""etiqueta respiratória"", como cobrir a boca com o braço ao tossir e espirrar.

 Os dados, divulgados na noite desta sexta (17), abrangem os primeiros resultados da pesquisa Vigitel Covid-19, feita pelo Ministério da Saúde em parceria com a Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais. O objetivo é descrever padrões de comportamentos de risco e proteção para a doença no país.

 Para calcular o que chama de ""prevenção ideal"" para o [coronavírus](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/cotidiano/coronavirus/), a pasta considerou o conjunto de pessoas com mais de 18 anos que afirmou, em entrevista, adotar todo o conjunto de práticas recomendadas. 

 Segundo o ministério, 36,7% da população adulta disse adotar todas as práticas. Entre homens, o índice foi pouco menor, de 33,3%. Já entre mulheres, foi de 39,9%. Os dados foram divulgados em boletim epidemiológico da pasta.

 Nesta primeira etapa da pesquisa, foram ouvidas 2.000 pessoas, distribuídas em diferentes regiões do país, entre os dias 1º e 10 de abril. A metodologia utilizada se baseia em amostras probabilísticas da população adulta com posse de, pelo menos, uma linha de telefone celular.

  Foram usados fatores de ponderação para que os dados coletados pudessem representar as macrorregiões e o Brasil, informa o documento. O intervalo de confiança é de 95%.

 Segundo o ministério, o percentual da população que afirma lavar as mãos com frequência foi de 82,7%. Já quando observados as práticas complementares de higiene, como não compartilhar objetos pessoais, o índice cai para 66,3%. A pasta, no entanto, não divulgou os dados completos de todas as variáveis pesquisadas.

 No levantamento, o ministério também questionou a adesão a medidas de isolamento – considerado na abordagem como evitar sair de casa sempre que possível, evitar aglomerações ou frequentar lugares muito cheios e evitar contato próximo com outras pessoas, como cumprimentos e abraços. Neste caso, o percentual de adultos que preferiram realizar medidas de isolamento social foi de 90%. A pesquisa, no entanto, usou respostas estimuladas e abordou um conceito amplo de isolamento.

 Em [São Paulo](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/equilibrioesaude/2020/04/governo-de-sao-paulo-deve-distribuir-120-mil-testes-rapidos-a-municipios.shtml), dados de um sistema de monitoramento do governo estadual com base em dados de celulares apontavam percentual de isolamento de 49% nesta quinta (16). A adesão ideal é de 70%.

 Em outra frente, o ministério também questionou quais os principais meios usados pela população para obter informações sobre a Covid-19. Televisão foi o maior percentual, com 94,2%. Em seguida, vem a internet e redes sociais, com 93,9%, seguido de rádio, com 62,3%, e jornais impressos (51,8%).

 Já o menor índice foi para canais oficiais do [Ministério da Saúde](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/equilibrioesaude/2020/04/teich-tem-1o-dia-em-reunioes-sob-vigilancia-de-assessor-de-comunicacao-do-planalto.shtml), com 44,3%. Neste item, segundo a pasta, o índice aumenta entre a população mais jovem, chegando a 52% entre aqueles entre 18 e 34 anos.

 Ainda de acordo com a pasta, uma nova etapa de avaliação está prevista para 25 de abril a 4 de maio."

Interview with an epidemiologist:

[https://www.healthline.com/health-news/ask-an-expert-will-quarantines-make-the-coronavirus-worse#4](https://www.healthline.com/health-news/ask-an-expert-will-quarantines-make-the-coronavirus-worse#4)

""Travel bans are complicated and often counterproductive.

It’s possible that a travel ban from the most high-risk areas might slow spread of disease at the very beginning of an outbreak, but as many health experts have noted, with a disease like COVID-19, travel bans aren’t particularly effective. In this case, the genie is already out of the bottle.

It has been established that COVID-19 can present with mild or no symptoms at all. As a result, it can spread before someone knows that they are ill.

Millions of people have been traveling internationally without symptoms or mild disease for weeks before the epidemic was recognized. There are cases all over the world at this point.""

""And we seem to have forgotten that closing borders against infectious disease doesn’t work. Many countries have done so, despite the WHO’s advice, but they are now discovering that the bug is already on the inside – and they have still got to deal with it.""

BEIJING—Since the Cultural Revolution ended in the mid-1970s, China's economy, fueled by market reforms, has notched up more than four decades of unbroken gains, enlarging the domestic economy by roughly a hundredfold and transforming the world.

That winning streak is over. China on Friday reported a 6.8% year-over-year contraction in its economy for the first three months of the year—the first quarterly decline in gross domestic product since official record-keeping began in 1992 and likely the first since Mao Zedong's death in 1976, economists said.

The fall was even steeper compared with the previous quarter: a 9.8% pullback as the coronavirus that first emerged in the central Chinese city of Wuhan spread across the country and around the world, delivering an economic blow unprecedented in modern times.

""The scale and breadth of China's economic contraction are staggering,"" said Eswar Prasad, an economics professor at Cornell University and the former head of the International Monetary Fund's China division. ""There is little prospect of China driving a revival of global growth.""

After shuttering Wuhan and enforcing a strict, roughly two-month nationwide shutdown of all but the most essential commercial activity, China has largely returned to work.

That could be seen most clearly in the manufacturing sector, where official data released Friday showed industrial production down just 1.1% in March compared with last year. Other metrics, such as daily power production and coal consumption, have regained all or most of last year's levels.

But China's manufacturing recovery has arrived just as many of its most important customers in the West went into lockdown mode.

Allen Luo, an exporter of floor tiles in southern Guangdong province, said he wasn't too affected by the initial domestic shutdown, but the global spread of the coronavirus ""is a death blow to us.""

Mr. Luo saw the order book at his company, Foshan Homey Ceramics Co., start to shrink in mid-March, as customers in North America, Africa and Southeast Asia canceled purchases. In all, he says, he lost 70% of his overseas orders.

His remaining shipments have seen delivery times pushed back to July or August amid uncertainty about logistics and customs regulations. Meanwhile, liquidity is becoming a serious issue.

No one, least of all Mr. Luo, knows how long it will be before consumers in the West are ready to spend again—and whether they will spend in the same way.

U.S. retail sales dropped by a record 8.7% in March from the previous month, the biggest decline since records began in 1992. Some of the largest drops came in discretionary purchases that have undergirded China's exporters for years. That included a 25% sales drop at furniture stores, a 16% drop in sales at electronics stores, a 51% drop in sales at apparel stores and a 23% drop in sales at sporting goods stores.

Though some of Mr. Luo's friends in the home furnishings industry have laid off employees, Homey Ceramics hasn't fired any of its 330 employees yet, helped in part by local government policies offering rent, electricity and insurance relief. The company is capable of producing 1.3 million square feet of flooring a day at full capacity, but it has shut down some of its production lines.

""We can still hold up if things get back to normal in July,"" he said in an interview this week. ""But it is hard to say if the situation will last more than three months.""

While the first hit to China's economy in January and February—a blow to domestic consumption—was largely manageable, Lian Ping, chief economist at Zhixin Investment Research Institute, said the impact from falling global demand could prove far more painful. ""After all, China is the world's biggest exporter, the 'world's factory,'"" he said.

""There is little hope that the Chinese economy could see a rapid recovery in the coming months,"" said Hao Zhou, an economist at Commerzbank, pointing to the global economic slowdown and the recent emergence of new cases of coronavirus transmission within China.

While China has shifted focus in recent years toward domestic consumption, which now accounts for more than half of the economy, Chinese consumers also face formidable challenges.

On Friday, China reported a 16% nosedive in domestic retail sales in March from a year earlier, coming on the heels of a 20.5% tumble in the previous two months.

Joblessness has emerged as an additional worry, soaring from a narrow range around 5.0% in recent years to 5.9% in March—after a record 6.2% in February.

Though officials said Friday that China hasn't suffered large-scale layoffs despite the pandemic, economists estimate as many as 80 million people—roughly twice the population of California—have lost their jobs or not been able to return to work in the past three months, in a working age population of roughly 900 million.

Larry Hu, an economist at Macquarie Group, said he expects joblessness to rise by another 10 million in the coming months unless Beijing enacts a major stimulus.

China is also facing the largest graduating college class in nearly a decade, with nine million white-collar workers entering one of the most challenging job markets in recent memory. Peking University said in a study published Wednesday that employment ads had fallen 27% in the first three months of the year, with the drop steepest among firms tied to global trade.

The job challenges are squeezing spending by China's urban residents. In the first quarter, China reported its first year-over-year drop in disposable income since the government began to release the data in 2002, when adjusted for inflation.

Last week, in a sign of the challenges in jump-starting consumption, a queue of mostly young people, some carrying branded handbags, snaked around a central Beijing building that is home to a handful of consumer lending firms.

Lü Jun, a customer manager at the building's Ping An Bank Co. branch said loan delinquencies have been on the rise recently, fueling demand for more loans. He said his customers include small-business owners facing liquidity problems and young people grappling with credit card debt, with many seeking loans from 300,000 yuan ($42,360) up to several million yuan.

Meanwhile, in a bid to get consumers spending again, local governments across China have issued digital vouchers to stimulate spending in bricks-and-mortar stores. Since late March, citizens in the eastern city of Hangzhou had redeemed 303 million yuan, leading to 3.25 billion yuan of consumption, as of Tuesday, according to official data.

Sun Wen, a 35-year-old resident of the city, has used every voucher, saving 10 yuan for every 40 yuan that she spends. Though the face value of the vouchers is relatively small, they can be used at merchants large and small throughout the city, she said.

""I spent the first coupon to buy two cups of milk tea, which was the first milk tea I have drank in the past few months,"" said Ms. Sun, who said the vouchers also convinced her family to dine out for the first time in months.

In the southern Chinese city of Foshan, Luo Ying recently took her government-issued vouchers to the supermarket, after two months of ordering groceries online. She also dropped by some nearby stores, returning home with a dozen toothbrushes, six boxes of yogurt, snacks and detergent. If not for the government vouchers, Ms. Luo said, ""I wouldn't go out.""

To sustain the rebound, some economists have called for a major stimulus package, akin to the large-scale measures China has taken during past downturns. So far, however, Beijing has largely taken a hands-off approach, limiting itself to moderate steps boosting liquidity and lowering borrowing costs.

On Friday, Mao Shengyong, a spokesman for China's National Bureau of Statistics, said officials would unveil more policy measures to counter the impact from the pandemic if needed, with a focus on propping up domestic demand. ""My understanding is that this year and next year, on average, growth should be above 5%,"" he said.

Tommy Wu, lead economist at Oxford Economics, is skeptical. He told clients Friday that he doesn't expect much stimulus this year, given concerns about leverage and financial instability. Thus, he is expecting virtually no growth this year.

Andrew Tilton, chief Asia Pacific economist for Goldman Sachs, expects policy makers to launch a more concerted fiscal stimulus, though he predicted any action would be smaller than the one that followed the 2008 financial crisis.

Instead, Mr. Tilton pointed to Chinese authorities' emphatic focus on reducing the spread of the virus domestically, which he says will pave the way for a more robust long-term recovery. ""If people feel safe going back out and getting back to as close to normal as they can get, that's the biggest stimulus,"" he said."

Tralasciamo il fatto che vari studi dimostrano che le mascherine (chirurgiche o i respiratori propriamente detti) limitano lo spargimento di particelle virali da chi è malato e che hanno una più o meno grande capacità di proteggere anche chi le indossa dal contagio - questo consiglio è stato chiaramente motivato dalla necessità di preservare lo stock di DPI per gli operatori sanitari. Una chiara dimostrazione della differenza tra la preservazione della salute individuale e la preservazione della salute pubblica.

[Parole dell'OMS](https://www.who.int/publications-detail/advice-on-the-use-of-masks-in-the-community-during-home-care-and-in-healthcare-settings-in-the-context-of-the-novel-coronavirus-(2019-ncov)-outbreak):

>**Medical masks should be reserved for health care workers.**   
>  
>The use of medical masks in the community may create a false sense of security, with neglect of other essential measures, such as hand hygiene practices and physical distancing, and may lead to touching the face under the masks and under the eyes, result in unnecessary costs, and take masks away from those in health care who need them most, especially when masks are in short supply.

Un po' come dire che è meglio non usare i profilattici, perché c'è un rischio che venga infilato male e si rompa.

**L'OMS diffonde per omissione informazioni anti-scientifiche supportate dal governo cinese**

[Source](https://sverigesradio.se/sida/artikel.aspx?programid=2054&artikel=7426566)**.**

A febbraio l'OMS pubblica nella sua pagina Q&A sul nuovo coronavirus una lista di ""rimedi che non funzionano contro COVID-19"". Sono: fumare sigarette, indossare più maschere, prendere antibiotici **e i rimedi di erboristeria tradizionale cinese**.

Peccato che Xi raccomandi ai lavoratori di usare simili rimedi, e il 7 marzo l'autorità della salute cinese pubblica nuove linee guida per combattere il virus, **dicendo che i rimedi della medicina cinese tradizionale devono essere usati e incoraggiati.**

**Il giorno dopo l'OMS si cala per benino le braghe e rimuove dalla lista dei rimedi che non funzionano il riferimento all'erboristeria tradizionale cinese.**"

India decided to export hydroxychloroquine not because of goodwill or selflessness but because it was pressured by the close allies of the Prime Minister Narendra Modi like Donald Trump, Brazil's president Jair Bolsonaro, Israel's Benjamin Netanyahu, and even threatened with retaliation. And our prime minister, being a good man he is (not actually but he likes to pretend as one), complied to his camaraderie's request and revoked the decision to suspend the export of the said drug.

The whole of India has been in lockdown since March 24 and will remain so till May 3 which will possibly be extended and only essential services are operational. And so the labour force you talked about has either been locked indoor or driven from their home because their livelihood has been disrupted. And I highly doubt there's enough inventories in India to produce emergency gears for the world, let alone for India.

The Indian government certainly didn't put its citizens first. When the world was hit by the coronavirus and governments the world over were planning what should be done, the Indian government was busy trying to topple a state government (they did succeed in doing that btw). And when they announce that the whole country will be locked down, it was done so without any prior information and the whole country was in disarray as a result. The sudden and unplanned manner of the implementation of the lockdown might have done more harm than good. Thousands from the cities where people are more likely to be affected huddled together to train stations and bus terminal to go to their respective towns and villages. Many decided to walk homes, some of which are over 200 km away, and some of them died of exhaustion.

I'm not sure if you still reading, but I want to say that no government, except South Korea and some other East Asian nations, has handled this pandemic well, and India is no exception. Nations need to cooperate more than ever but most seem to be self-interested and competing one another even for emergency kits. Lots of lessons to be learned.

Wish you and your country well, OP. We will get through this. Alive (hopefully)."

Read the list of what you can treat with these machines in the very article that you've linked. Covid-19 is not on it.



As said before, you can use BiPAP for treatment of sleep apnoe but **not** for Covid-19 treatment. For those you need mechanical ventilators.

Here are four more hospitals saying they got bpaps and not the required mechanical ventilators:

After Bernie dropped out, I thought Biden might have a chance because of the voter turnout. 

But honestly, Democrats are so out of touch with the working class, I think Trump will win more states than 2016. 

Of course celebrities, students and younger people would be asking to continually shut down the economy.. celebrities are rich af, most students work part time and are financially supoorted and younger people have no family to feed.

Like you see this working class people protesting, not all of them are Trump supporters, then they see Nancy Pelosi with her 40k fridges stocking up on premium ice cream and you think they'll vote Dem?

If you look at all the battle design interviews and dungeon designs, a lot of stuff takes months of work.  The 5.25 dungeon certainly wasn't done in six weeks - the environmental art and terrain sculpting alone takes a substantial amount of time, not to mention all the asset art, battle scripting, cutscene scripting, soundwork, and QA time.

If you wind back to when they were talking about Eureka, Pagos didn't incorporate feedback from Anemos because it was already too far along in development by the time Anemos was released.  That suggests about a six month (or more) lead time for instanced content, which also lines up with some of the fanfest battle panels where they talk about raid design.

That doesn't mean the 5.3 trial is done, it's probably in some mostly-done state.  Yoshida's coronavirus letter suggests voiceover is delayed.  Soken in the past has implied the music comes later in the dev cycle, so that could be not ready as well.  And of course, fight scripting and tuning.  But given the X.3 trial tends to be a MSQ trial, it's not something they'd show off in a live letter anyway.  The dungeon maybe, since there's more they can show off there that doesn't require it to be 100% ready."

What I mean about this being unprecedented is the scale of global communication and cooperation that could have been done to prepare other countries as it started to move across the globe. We have those technologies to share information, which was not available during the Spanish Flu. The amount of collaboration available these days is incredible, but if we can't get to some form of global agreement during these types of pandemics, that spread of helpful information isn't going to happen as well as it could, and then when you add in all the denial from various governments, particularly like the United States and Brazil, even if we had been given good data, which it appears we were, political leaders have different agendas and as evidenced by our current situation, still wont do the right thing. 

Wasn't there a UG govt committee whose purpose was specifically to deal with global pandemics that was dissolved by the Trump Administration? They likely would have tried to channel as much good communication and data as possible, and they likely did have some sort of emergency plan in place. It's interesting how we have emergency planning for things like hurricanes, but evidently not so much for this type of pandemic.

It's like, at least in the US, they had zero expectation of any of this and have been trying to Cobble together some sort of solution little piece by little piece with zero appropriate nationwide leadership, guidance, and direction. So bizarre when there's so much history to provide a basis for such better planning than what we're experiencing. (again, I know that sounds contradictory to what I said about the Spanish Flu, but even if this Global pandemic had never been this grand by scale, we certainly could have learned from prior disease outbreaks to come up with an emergency plan that's better than the nonsense they're trying to put together now.) 

And really I think my bigger point is that while there may not be a precedent exactly like coronavirus 19, isn't that exactly what emergency planning is about, making sure you plan not only for what's happened in the past but for that big unknown that could happen in the future?"

The Trump Administration completely ignored it.

I'm not even form the US, I'm from a third world country and I don't know in details about this small government big government debate in the US, but look at South Korea and tell me if it's that killer of a virus, look at japan when NOBODY is self-isolating, japan is just doing FINE.

Most arguments in favor of the coronavirus severity mentions the death rate in Italy and the lack of medical capacity in hospitals. well, in Italy the death rate is ALREADY HIGH BEFORE THE VIRUS OF THOSE WHO ARE OLD, the virus is indeed doing it's thing on them there's no denying that, but a simpler solution is to let those people who actually in need of quarantine to self-quarantine at home instead of having millions losing their jobs, dying form hunger [etc.](https://etc.In) 

Another factoid is that projected death rates for the UK by the UN prior  to the virus forecast a weekly average rate of 12,010 deaths per week  in 2020.  The actual number of total deaths in the UK since Jan 1  recorded by the government has been a weekly average of 11,576 !

so far it seems that almost all deaths are people with **severe** underlying condition, **and  yet we have no idea whatsoever about all the people with underlying  condition that are doing just fine because we don't have that data**.

We're all allowing all the  governments in the world to dictate to us to sit at home, And this will NOT end after the pandemic, all the governments around the world found this as a pretty good opportunity to set their foot for more power.  Meanwhile 99% of the hospitals are corrupted and busy paying million of  dollars to their CEOs all around the world as well [as lobbying the government to defend the status quo](https://www.openthebooks.com/top-82-us-non-profit-hospitals-quantifying-government-payments-and-financial-assets--open-the-books-oversight-report/) in the US but apparently doesn't have enough money to scale up or prepare for such pandemics."

Sabían que era un Virus parecido al SARS pero más contagioso... recordemos que metieron en prisión al médico que trató de informar del problema el cual murió de Coronavirus. 

> Pero si cerraron la zona a cal y canto! Vamos, que yo en ese momento flipe porque NADIE podía salir de su zona nisiquiera para volver a su casa (ya que les pillo en año nuevo chino y se habían desplazado).

Aquí hasta finales de febrero si no recuerdo mal seguían llegando avión desde China, si bien confinaron a la población el virus puede ser transportado en mercancías los números en TODA China deberían ser muchísimo más altos. E ahí el problema, la gente que no viajaba desde Wuhan porque todo el mundo centraba su foco allí. 


>Mi problema con china es que es difícil dicernir que es verdad y que no, porque los medios americanos suelen ser MUY poco imparciales respecto al tema, intentando vender a China como una dictadura mortal y súper cerrada y negativa.

>Pero claro, tampoco te vas a creer todo lo que te diga la propia china....

Hombre, yo personalmente no puedo ser parcial con un país que impide que medios occidentales operen allí y sobretodo la censura sistemática y es sistema Orweilliano de puntos que están probando. Los medios americanos van a defender sus posiciones, pero al menos no todo sale dictado desde el despacho de Trump y puedes esperar distintas opiniones sobre cualquier tema.


>Hay por ahí un youtuber Español que vive en China y quizás sea un poco más imparcial, aunque se suele meter poco en politica

>Jabiertzo creo que se llama

Si, conozco ese youtuber... y no se moja en nada. Pero esto es como todo, hay opiniones de que China es un sitio fantástico siempre y cuando no te preocupen las libertades individuales y no te metas en problemas, no? Pues eso... el no querrá meterse en problemas porque a lo mejor va la policía a la puerta de su casa aunque nadie en China vea sus vídeos ya que están prohibidos. Paradójico, prohibir algo que no se puede consumir. 

Aparte no mojarse no significa ser pragmático... ni mucho menos. 

Te recomiendo ver algunos vídeos del youtuber que he puesto en el link sobre bueno, todo en China así como China Uncensored, te puedo recomendar el vídeo que habla de cómo Hollywood cede a las presiones chinas y no pueden mostrar ninguna ciudad china devastada porque es “mala publicidad”. 

Eso sin hablar de toda la polémica del 5G de Huawei. 

Vamos, que ellos tienen mucho que ganar de esta situación porque son en parte el alma de la globalización y tienen demasiado poder para poder coaccionar a medio mundo y salirse con la suya, pese habernos puesto en peligro a todos."

We also know many people who have it are asymptomatic and thus nearly impossible to confirm/trace. Meaning people from china were still coming over here on work travel etc. carrying it and spreading. If we believe this is as infectious as it is, and as dangerous as it is, we need to realize that over 1.5 months of unmitigated spread could have infected millions of Americans. 

The more accurate statement I should have said is ""months before we closed the country"". 

Even now we don't even really know the full extent of what's happening with it. I'd draw your attention to this excerpt from [Source](https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/country/us/)

>**30720 new cases** and **6185 new deaths** in [**the United States**](https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/country/us/)  
**New York City** today has reported **3,778 additional deaths** that have occurred since March 11 and have been classified as ""probable,"" defined as follows: “decedent \[...\] had no known positive laboratory test for SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) but the **death certificate lists as a cause of death “COVID-19”** or an equivalent"". We will add these to the New York State total as soon as it is determined whether the historical distribution can be obtained

So now we are attributing deaths to COVID-19 without a positive test. [Look at this graph of people in the hospital due to ""influenza like illness""](https://www.cdc.gov/flu/weekly/weeklyarchives2019-2020/images/ILI15_small.gif) from the CDC. All of these people likely got treated and left the hospital, but it does seem odd that 2019-2020 seems to be one of the worst flu years in recent data. We don't know for sure if that was just a bad flu year or COVID-19 patients that went into the hospital and we discharged once they were better. 

I just want a test that can show if you have had COVID-19 or not. That's the only way we will know what's going on and if we can reopen the economy."

2020-04-18,frexynator,college,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/g3d5je/hi_from_a_professor/fns18l9/,"A message from a student.

First of all, let me set the stage. I'm a standard student, my grades alright (around 13, the scale is from 0-20) but I was never the type of person to study ALOT, something in me hates the concept of studying and so I can't do it for a long time and thus my alright grades. I have always been a person who loves the outside and really needs it to keep a good mental state.

Now im on my 4th semester and it's been a shit show all around, ever since I started collage i had this lingering feeling that i was waiting my potential by doing the thing im doing (probably due to my deep hatred for studying) and because of this I have a really hard time to keep myself motivated throughout the semester and this just becomes a vicious cicle of not wanting to do anything.

Now when the outbreak first began I was a little bit happy in the sense that I was having problems with my classmates and I really need time to get away from everybody, but boy was I wrong. Everything started alright with every professor trying to adapt to the situation but things got weird FAST. At the moment I have 4 classes in which 2 are very leaned towards experiments and ,due to coronavirus, that is no long possible but the professor's don't seem to care, I still have to make report on the alleged ""experiments"" and draw conclusions from things I never did and it just feels like such bullshit because they didn't even try to adapt to the fact that we didn't do said experiments and just made us use the results from past year's (which is horrible because imagine in one result there was a mistake because someone got something wrong, i won't know this and therefore make the wrong conclusions for something that's out of my control). I have a teacher that refuses to give online classes because he isn't ""a cinema star"" (his exact words) and so just gives us chapters every week to read from a random book that he doesn't even provide. Another professor doesn't have any type of supporting slide which is normally fine, he would just write the stuff on the board but online you can't do that and so I have 3h classes were he just talks and I'm supposed to just catch i all because if i don't i can't just look at a powerpoint. Another thing that is really messed up is the fact that i stopped having breaks, when we had classes on campus, if the class was longer that 1h 30min we would have access to a 10min break and would have 15 min breaks between classes but now no one cares, i have 3h classes with no breaks and then have to go running to the next 3h class and I can't even breathe, the lack of breaks means it's impossible to pay attention to classes (and yes we ask for a break but they just ignore it) and sometimes the teachers knowingly overlap classes because the just wanna ""finish this little thing"" and then I have 10 min were I have 2 classes at the same time and Iim supposed to pay attention to everything???. This really feels like a shit show, the professor's don't seem to respect the students, fail to adapt to the current situation and the give more assignments for reasons i can only describe as ""just because"", make the test WAY harder because ""we all have access to the material"" and it just sucks. There is so much stuff in our shoulders and the lack of ""outside"" just removes all of the motivation needed to face this so everyone is slowly sinking and feeling more depressed/incapable than ever and the teachers don't seem to care.

In conclusion, you don't seem like the type of professor to do this but please keep in mind your students, we need breaks from classes to refresh out attention span especially when it's online and there is another barrier between us. It's a hard situation to all of us so just go easy on us and to all of the struggling students, you all got this, it sucks but you are not alone in this, please make sure you have someone to talk to and just take one step at a time"

She is super strict with the watches she picks, has them in observation for some time and brings the to a watchmaker to check everything is perfect. Very kind and nice too. She didn't know about Repladies and I introduced her to this community so hopefully she decides to show up here too because the replica watches forum and r/RepTime is like far too confusing for me. 

This is her contact info for those that like me, are too lazy to go to the replica watches forum: [shayijjx@gmail.com](mailto:shayijjx@gmail.com) 

Thanks to the replady that commented about her watch from Lucy on this same thread ages ago. Thanks to her I discovered Lucy and I ended up getting her same watch (she wrote a [review](https://www.reddit.com/r/RepLadies/comments/epgdd9/review_afs_cartier_ballon_bleu_is_satisfying_af/), which I'm too lazy and to busy to do at the moment).  I need to resize the bracelet because it's a little bit big on me, though I'm afraid that if I take a link out it will end up being too small. Obviously, all jewellery shops are closed right now in my country so it will be a while. I know that there are resizing kits you can buy but I'm like far too clumsy for that. 

She told me that she also sells handbags and jewellery but I'm trying to save my coins because of the coronavirus and because DHL has been driving me craaazy so it will be a while for me to be back on the repgame. I think I'm overdue an stay on ban island."

2020-04-18,velvetycross54,Charlotte,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Charlotte/comments/g3hgz0/i_want_to_know_the_perspective/fns2plb/,"It's mainly because of articles like this:

The model used to make federal policy is severely flawed - https://www.statnews.com/2020/04/17/influential-covid-19-model-uses-flawed-methods-shouldnt-guide-policies-critics-say/

Stanford study indicates a possible high number of unreported mild/asymptomatic cases - https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.14.20062463v1

Study suggests nearly half of Iceland's positive cases are asymptomatic - https://www.cnn.com/2020/04/01/europe/iceland-testing-coronavirus-intl/index.html

It's easy to look at articles and journal studies like these and believe that there is some fear mongering going on with the Coronavirus. If nearly half of all infections are asymptomatic, then nearly half of people infected will never get tested in the US, and taking that even further, you could assume that the accurate mortality rate for Covid-19 is about half the reported rate. Then you have the fact that the federal government is using a flawed model to make policy decisions? That doesn't instill a whole lot of confidence in their recommendations (an argument could be made that model was chosen intentionally by the current leadership though). 

Anecdotally too, I'm hearing people talk about being called back by hospitals to reschedule appointments/procedures because there hasn't been the predicted influx of patients, and now doctors are being furloughed/laid off. 

Then speaking as a person who's job is okay now, but works in a vulnerable industry, a lot of our customers are shutting down for a few weeks due to the decrease in consumer demand. This will affect my company's production severally - we're already at 50% of the projected volume and sales revenue for this month. This is only going to get worse for us as a lot of our customers are in rural areas and can't sustain a prolonged shutdown. We're under a hiring freeze as well meaning we can't fill two positions that are needed for my department to not be understaffed, causing my manager to have to come in to the office with all of us to help while his wife just had a kidney transplant in January. My wife works in a construction related industry and her company already had layoffs over the summer, and are now experiencing some decreased workloads again causing us some worry about that.

I personally think we should open up non-essential businesses but require masks in public, and ask that all high-risk people to stay home. Keep the bars/restaurants/taprooms closed too. Anyplace where there are people just sitting/standing without a mask is going to be trouble. As someone else said, the hair stylist should be able to choose whether or not to go to work. At least give them the option to keep their income stream right now. And don't take away all the new safety nets either. We needed those like 10 years ago."

###Tips For Social Distancing, Quarantine, And Isolation During An Infectious Disease Outbreak

**What Is Social Distancing?**

Social distancing is a way to keep people from interacting closely or frequently enough to spread an infectious disease. Schools and other gathering places such as movie theaters may close, and sports events and religious services may be cancelled.

**What Is Quarantine?**

Quarantine separates and restricts the movement of people who have been exposed to a contagious disease to see if they become sick. It lasts long enough to ensure the person has not contracted an infectious disease.

**What Is Isolation?**

Isolation prevents the spread of an infectious disease by separating people who are sick from those who are not. It lasts as long as the disease is contagious.

##What To Expect: Typical Reactions

Everyone reacts differently to stressful situations such as an infectious disease outbreak that requires social distancing, quarantine, or isolation. People may feel:

- **Anxiety, worry, or fear related to**:  
- Your own health status  
- The health status of others whom you may have exposed to the disease  
- The resentment that your friends and family may feel if they need to go into quarantine as a result of contact with you  
- The experience of monitoring yourself, or being monitored by others for signs and symptoms of the disease  
- Time taken off from work and the potential loss of income and job security  
- The challenges of securing things you need, such as groceries and personal care items  
- **Concern** about being able to effectively care for children or others in your care  
- **Uncertainty or frustration** about how long you will need to remain in this situation, and uncertainty about the future  
- **Loneliness** associated with feeling cut off from the world and from loved ones  
- **Anger** if you think you were exposed to the disease because of others’ negligence  
- **Boredom and frustration** because you may not be able to work or engage in regular day-to-day activities  
- **Uncertainty or ambivalence** about the situation  
- **A desire** to use alcohol or drugs to cope  
- **Symptoms of depression**, such as feelings of hopelessness, changes in appetite, or sleeping too little or too much  
- **Symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD)**, such as intrusive distressing memories, flashbacks (reliving the event), nightmares, changes in thoughts and mood, and being easily startled.

##Ways To Support Yourself During Social Distancing, Quarantine, and Isolation

#UNDERSTAND THE RISK

Consider the real risk of harm to yourself and others around you. The public perception of risk during a situation such as an infectious disease outbreak is often inaccurate. Media coverage may create the impression that people are in immediate danger when really the risk for infection may be very low. Take steps to get the facts:

- Stay up to date on what is happening, while limiting your media exposure. Avoid watching or listening to news reports 24/7 since this tends to increase anxiety and worry. Remember that children are especially affected by what they hear and see on television.  
- Look to credible sources for information on the infectious disease outbreak.

#BE YOUR OWN ADVOCATE

Speaking out about your needs is particularly important if you are in quarantine, since you may not be in a hospital or other facility where your basic needs are met. Ensure you have what you need to feel safe, secure, and comfortable.

- Work with local, state, or national health officials to find out how you can arrange for groceries and toiletries to be delivered to your home as needed.  
- Inform health care providers or health authorities of any needed medications and work with them to ensure that you continue to receive those medications.

#EDUCATE YOURSELF

Health care providers and health authorities should provide information on the disease, its diagnosis, and treatment.

- Do not be afraid to ask questions—clear communication with a health care provider may help reduce any distress associated with social distancing, quarantine, or isolation.  
- Ask for written information when available.  
- Ask a family member or friend to obtain information in the event that you are unable to secure this information on your own.

#WORK WITH YOUR EMPLOYER TO REDUCE FINANCIAL STRESS

If you’re unable to work during this time, you may experience stress related to your job status or financial situation.

- Provide your employer with a clear explanation of why you are away from work.  
- Contact the U.S. Department of Labor tollfree at 1-866-487-2365 about the Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA), which allows U.S. employees up to 12 weeks of unpaid leave for serious medical conditions, or to care for a family member with a serious medical condition.  
- Contact your utility providers, cable and Internet provider, and other companies from whom you get monthly bills to explain your situation and request alternative bill payment arrangements as needed.

#CONNECT WITH OTHERS

Reaching out to people you trust is one of the best ways to reduce anxiety, depression, loneliness, and boredom during social distancing, quarantine, and isolation. You can:

- Use the telephone, email, text messaging, and social media to connect with friends, family, and others.  
- Talk “face to face” with friends and loved ones using Skype or FaceTime.  
- If approved by health authorities and your health care providers, arrange for your friends and loved ones to bring you newspapers, movies, and books.  
- Sign up for emergency alerts via text or email to ensure you get updates as soon as they are available.  
- Call SAMHSA’s free 24-hour Disaster Distress Helpline at 1-800-985-5990, if you feel lonely or need support.  
- Use the Internet, radio, and television to keep up with local, national, and world events.  
- If you need to connect with someone because of an ongoing alcohol or drug problem, consider calling your local Alcoholics Anonymous or Narcotics Anonymous offices.

#TALK TO YOUR DOCTOR

If you are in a medical facility, you may have access to health care providers who can answer your questions. However, if you are quarantined at home, and you’re worried about physical symptoms you or your loved ones may be experiencing, call your doctor or other health care provider:

- Ask your provider whether it would be possible to schedule remote appointments via Skype or FaceTime for mental health, substance use, or physical health needs.

#USE PRACTICAL WAYS TO COPE AND RELAX

- Relax your body often by doing things that work for you-take deep breaths, stretch, meditate or pray, or engage in activities you enjoy.  
- Pace yourself between stressful activities, and do something fun after a hard task.  
- Talk about your experiences and feelings to loved ones and friends, if you find it helpful.  
- Maintain a sense of hope and positive thinking; consider keeping a journal where you write down things you are grateful for or that are going well

Have you ever seen soap with bacterial growth on/in it?  Soap itself is antibacterial due to the high pH (even if it is diluted, the pH is too high for household bacteria to survive and reproduce—although I am as certain as I can be that somewhere on this planet, there are bacteria that have adapted to life under more alkaline conditions, what we're mostly dealing with here is E. coli).  The preservatives mentioned in the comments above are mainly for cosmetics such as lotion or hair conditioner, and it would be a waste of money to add them to soap.  Just dilute the soap with normal tap water and use it.  It will be fine.

I'd start with documenting all of that so that you have a plan to start with, it's boring but important if you are going from a flat network to vlans.  

I'm not familiar with the router you mention but it looks like a typical small business one, read up on how creating vlans with it and trunking them out on the port to your managed switch.  Read up on the documentation for your switches to see how to configure the uplink port for trunking and how to configure the vlans on access ports.

If the other switches you have can not be managed, then everything connected to that switch would be on one vlan.

Once you have things on separate vlans, than you can start applying your access rules to restrict traffic between the networks.

I don't think there's simples fixes for the list of things you want to accomplish, but that is where I would start.  Also depending on how rusty your networking skills are.  Take some time and read up on basic networking knowledge again.  It's a good time with a lot of online training being available for free with coronavirus."

2020-04-18,carter1984,Charlotte,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Charlotte/comments/g3hgz0/i_want_to_know_the_perspective/fns2kyr/,"So I'll probably get slammed for this but I will give it a shot.

First I would think that you must come into to this with the understanding that the ""shutdown"" was a means to ""flatten the curve"". That is, it was meant to prevent hospitals and healthcare workers from being overwhelmed with everyone getting sick at the same time. It was not meant to eradicate the virus. I don't think that happens until there is an effective vaccine which might be years (if ever) in the making, OR until we develop herd immunity by way of the virus working its way through the population. To that extent, the shutdown has largely worked. To the best of knowledge, not even NY has needed all of the extra hospital beds that were ordered, and no where in the country has this been as serious a problem as was originally projected (not to discount the devastation caused by the death of loved ones, this is sucks no matter when or where it happens...but it happens everyday under a variety of circumstances already) which brings me to the second point.

Projections have been wildly confusing. Back in March, [the CDC modelers projected up to 214 million americans infected and 1.7 millions deaths](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/13/us/coronavirus-deaths-estimate.html) over the course of the year. As we can see with the numbers now, we are no where close to those types of numbers (based solely on testing and confirmed deaths). I'm 100% sure that the measures taken have helped keep those numbers low, but in perspective, we are now where close to those original models. We have not even hit a million confirmed cases nationwide, and stand around 30K deaths total. Even in Mecklenburg Co, we are a little over 1000 confirmed infections and 21 deaths with a population of over 1 million people (estimated). That is literally 1/10 of 1% of the population that has tested positive. Not only have the projections been wildly off, the ""peak"" goalposts keep moving. Originally we expected to peak in mid-April. Now some are saying we may not peak until June. What that says to me is that even the professionals don't *really* know what to expect from this, and there seems to be a lot of speculation going on in regards to how bad, and when it gets that bad, this is going to be.  That being said, there are probably far more cases that have gone untested which brings me to the next point...testing and severity.

There has no doubt been an issue with testing. With the scarcity of tests kits we have only been testing people with symptoms (for the most part...not sure how all those NBA players got them). So that skews our numbers overall. Since we can't actually test everyone, and account for ALL cases, including those with mild or no symptoms, it's hard to say just how deadly or widespread the virus is. All we can really do is look at the numbers of how many have tested positive because they were symptomatic, how many have been hospitalized, and how deaths have occurred. As I pointed out before, we KNOW that 0.1% of the population in Mecklenburg Co has tested positive. So let's assume that the infection rate is fully 10 times greater...that still leaves us with 1% of the population infected.  Only when testing becomes more widespread, and we are able to capture more of those with mild to no symptoms, will we be able to get a firm grasp on just how deadly this is. We are not there yet, but we certainly have not seen the devastating images that are conjured when faced with the worst case scenarios that were projected a month ago. I'll add here that I don't remember anyone in the news really reporting on the best case scenarios...it was mostly coverage of only the worst. 

Let's also look at the numbers in NC overall. About 60% of all the confirmed cases come from ten counties. There are fully 50% of the counties in the state that have 20 or fewer confirmed cases. 7 counties have 0 cases, and almost 30 counties have ten or fewer. Yet all of these counties are subject to the same orders from the governor. 

Now, consider the massive economic damage that is occurring *everywhere* in the state, even though 30% of all of our counties have ten or few cases, and 10% of our counties account 60% of all confirmed cases. If you get the virus, chances are you'll be sick, and get over it. Of the confirmed cases we are seeing, only about 20% require hospitalization. So consider a place like Union county. Should those numbers hold up, then out of the roughly 250,000 residents, and their 100-ish reported cases, perhaps about 20-25 would have a case of the virus so severe as to require a hospital stay. 

So you begin to have to weigh what we are seeing manifest in the numbers of infected and the severity of the cases against the long term economic damage being inflicted by these ""stay at home"" orders. People will catch the virus, some will get sick, some will get REALLY sick, and some will die. it will happen over the course of a few weeks or even months. Economically though, the devastation of closing businesses will have long lasting effects on both people's lives, effects that could last for years and perhaps a decade or more. Small business is the number one collective employer across the nation. While many think that if you own a business you are wealthy, or even rich, that is not often the case. Many are living just as poor people do, month to month, depending on the income generated to ay their employees and pay themselves, and when they start to fall it will have massive ripple effects in the economy. People will lose jobs. People will lose homes. Bankruptcy will be declared and loans will not be paid, along with rents and mortgages. As these small business close, they no longer place orders with other small to mediums business, which then too suffer declines in revenue, and may end up having to lay off workers, and possibly even default on loans and declare bankruptcy themselves. So, while the virus will infect and pass, the economic damage can ripple in a way that could be far more devastating than most people image.

Lastly I will say I am all for taking precautions. When this first hit and guidance was issued to wash your hands, don't touch your face, stay home if your sick, I thought to myself, that is all good common sense anyways. Add a measure of social distancing and limiting the opportunities to spread the virus, and I'm cool with that. Where I take issue with the situation as it has happened is that I am not entirely sure that the governor reacted in a way that demonstrates to me that any alternatives were considered to a complete shut down. We take for granted what has happened, and what we are told by ""the experts"", especially without any contrary information or options. I would like to know if the governor considered limited shutdowns . by county, or isolation and quarantine of the most vulnerable as opposed to everyone. I would like to know if the governor consulted with any small business to see if there were ways to adapt and change their business methods to stay open, rather than closing completely. I just didn't even see any talk of possible alternatives. Now, people ARE talking about ways to reopen, perhaps with some thought going to how we can continue to mitigate the effects of the virus without totally devastating people's livelihoods economically, so for that I am glad to hear that people are speaking up. 

I would also add that I am sure there are many who don't live in fear of the virus, as oppose to many that do live in fear of the virus. I respect both sides of that issue and would respect either opinion. I have no right to tell another person how to feel about a topic, only to express my own opinions on it. 

Hope that helps with your perspective question. It's just mine, and I'm sure others who might be in favor of reopening have different reasons and opinions, and I would hope they would share them as well."

Los vídeos no están prohibidos. Aquí tengo que llevarte la contraria xD.
China tiene una norma de que cualquier empresa que quiera vender en China o dar un servicio en China (youtuber es una de ella) tiene que asociarse obligatoriamente con una empresa china (para no perder el control sobre sus empresas, es una política proteccionista)

Youtuber decidió no aceptar las condiciones y por tanto no puede ofrecer servicios. Es como si una empresa no quisiera cumplir las normas para vender en Europa. 

Pero no está ""prohibido"" a la población usar YouTube. Sino que no se le permite a este ofrecer el servicio (sé que suena parecido, pero implica dos cosas diferentes).

>recordemos que metieron en prisión al médico que trató de informar del problema el cual murió de Coronavirus. 

Tenía entendido que no informo a los medios, sino a familiares suyos y que como aún no se sabía nada, le ""condenaron"" por difundir información.
Aunque creo que no lo encarcelaron, sino que siguió sirviendo en hospitales (supongo que harían faltas médicos que supieran del tema) hasta que se contagio y murió.

>Aquí hasta finales de febrero si no recuerdo mal seguían llegando avión desde China, si bien confinaron a la población el virus puede ser transportado en mercancías los números en TODA China deberían ser muchísimo más altos.

La cosa es que si confinaron y pararon toda actividad en wuham es normal que de allí no saliera ningún tipo de mercancía. Pero en el resto de china ""sino había casos"" pues seguían con su vida ""normal"".

China es tan grande como Europa, y es como criticar a Dinamarca por abrir fronteras, enviar mercancías por el mundo cuando aún tienes cerrado españa.

Great, they have the right for civil disobedience, except when they haven't been tested because there was a delay on ordering tests or ordering companies to make the tests that we don't know how many more people were put into danger.  This isn't a competition; we know Trump failed and he's not capable of humility or showing regret, sorrow, compassion or responsibility. 

Democrats are tweeting. Yes, but they're tweeting for people to stay inside and wash their hands.  People are dying because the federal government isn't efficient nor following the advice of their own expert until it was too late, then try to go back to normal before it is safe to do so.  Florida didnt want to stop spring breakers or close the beaches: they can't enforce social distancing when everybody goes out there: you cant stop a mob.  That's why when people want to relax the rules saying that people will be responsible, they've already shown that they can't be--because some don't even completely believe that this isn't a hoax: they just know that they cannot do to work or make money.  THAT I DO EMPATHIZE WITH.  I do not empathize with people who are just bored, at least to the same degree.

Ohio governor postponed their election because it was the right thing to do, and he isn't a Democrat, just someone who used his brain.

Just to show you that ALL LIVES MATTER (where are those protesters now?) and that this isn't about partisan politics: yes, I do believe that George H. W. Bush, George W. Bush, Jeb Bush, Nixon, Romney, McCain, Dole, Kasich and many, many other Republicans would've done better.  So to say that Democrats are no better, SURE, THERE ARE DEMOCRATS WHO MIGHT DO NO BETTER OR COULD DO EVEN WORSE, but the ones that ran and won or lost would still been capable of being shamed into doing the right thing and sticking through it.  Hey, WE STAYED THE COURSE in Iraq even though it was a bad decision to go to war in the first place, but this president can't even stay the course FOR ANYTHING for more than 24 hours before tweeting something he wanted all of us to do before tweeting the complete opposite a day later.

Ot that there weren't dozens of other violent leftist riots and hundreds of vicious and cowardly attacks by antifa for the crime of disagreeing with them or wearing the wrong color hat.

Matt Hancock said the equivalent of 105,000 travellers land per week, including from hotspot nations such as China, Italy and the United States. The government has not imposed any health checks or quarantine periods for people coming in to the country. In contrast, the US banned all travellers from Europe, and New Zealand enforced a mandatory 14-day quarantine for anyone entering.  
>  
>The UK government has consistently said screening passengers on arrival here would do very little to contain the spread of the virus. During an appearance on Good Morning Britain earlier this week, Mr Hancock defended the position. He said: ‘We don’t test at airports because the number of people coming through has dropped dramatically. ‘The epidemiological impact of keeping travel open is very small because there’s already large transmissions here.’ Testing also often fails to identify sufferers due to the virus’ two-week incubation period.

May as well just give up with that attitude. Everything makes a difference!!"

The markets seem to have priced in Coronavirus being gone by mid-late Q2 with no further complications.  That's pricing in the best case scenario, which leaves massive downside and little upside.  

Further, this isn't just a US-isolated event.  If you want borders to open and things to return to normal, you need a coordinated global effort.  A virus that is spreading outside your borders will inevitably reach them.  If the Spanish Flu could hit the entire planet in 1918, then you can bet Coronavirus will do it too, even with 5-10% of regular international air traffic.

The remdesivir hype is just that.  A drug which reduces fatality rate, but it must be administered intravenously at a hospital is not a proper solution.  If it works, it will not be available for widespread use until at least Q3.  It will require an unprecedented expedited approval process  and complex manufacturing scaling to make this a mainstream treatment.

It does nothing to impact spread rate or hospitalization rate.  For it to show a real impact, it needs to show strong improvement on non-critical patients.  Of the critical patients in the leaked study, 25% suffered organ damage and several perished.  This is an improvement, but it's hardly anything that can allow the world to disregard the coronavirus."

We started trying and got pregnant a few months in, then found out it was ectopic.  I was braced for the possibility of miscarriage but I was not expecting to have to choose to take medication to kill my baby or the baby could kill me.  That was rough.  Then we try for a few years and nothing.  

My aunt gets tested at a fertility clinic and has a genetic thing that pretty much makes you run out of eggs at 30.  At this point I get a referral to the fertility clinic and, yup, I have it too.  So even though we are 29 they jump us to the front of the line, skip all the other possible treatments and go straight to IVF on the highest dose of meds.  We only get four embryos.  

Embryo 1 failed.  Embryo 2 took!  Positive test!  I begin to get excited.  How likely is it that we will have such bad luck twice?  Miscarriage.  Embryo 3 failed.  They did a ton of painful tests before this, but now they want to check if there is any low level inflammation in the uterus stopping proper implantation.  What they actually meant was they would core out 4cm long of my uterus in a slim tube.  10/10 pain.  Worst in my life.  

Then they wanted to do it again for a receptivity test, which is when you go on the drugs and they pull out uterus tissue on the same day you would normally put an embryo in to see if they are putting it in too early or too late.  I am at a stalemate.  I cannot willingly go through that amount of pain again.  But I can't put our last embryo in willy-nilly.  What if it was the wrong day and we just killed the embryo because I didn't do the test?  (Also, IVF is freaking expensive, not sure if we can afford to do it again if last embryo doesn't work)  

I delayed for months like a coward, couldn't choose either.  Got pregnant by total luck (problems on both mine and hubby's side, were told it was unlikely to happen naturally and the ectopic was 'a bullet hitting another bullet' odds)

First check, low heartrate, told it might miscarry.  Second check, big subchorionic hematoma, told it might miscarry.  Third check, found out it was identical twins and one died.  Bleed at 9 weeks.  Baby checked, still alive!  Cannot do labwork to test for genetic problems due to missing twin screwing up the results.  Nuchal translucency passed!  

19 weeks they find a velamentous cord insertion and bilobed placenta.  21 weeks my cervix starts shortening and they start watching me weekly at the high risk clinic.  Cervix stabilizes on progesterone and stops shrinking after a few weeks!  Yay!  Growth checks for baby often due to velamentous cord insertion.  Baby growing well.  Last check at 33 weeks and I will get to graduate and become a normal pregnant woman until planned c-section at 39 weeks.  

But wait!  Now I have low amniotic fluid, and I am instructed to drink 4L of fluid a day (which is very unkind to a pregnant lady who is already getting up hourly to pee in the night) and get nonstress tests every two days.  And all this extra crap is on top of all the regular pregnancy complaints like first trimester nausea and sore hips and bloating and constipation etc.  The doctor was talking about moving my c-section sooner at the last visit.  

I am watching baby movement like a hawk.  Oh, and the global pandemic, with all of the wondering if my husband will be allowed into the c-section or will be allowed to stay with me after and help pass me the baby after my major abdominal surgery, or if I will have to recover alone for a few days while trying to figure out all the new parent stuff with no husband support.

I am tired.  So tired of being worried about my baby.  Tired of feeling burnt out before we even have the baby.  Tired of things going wrong.  Wondering if we will be stuck with a preemie in the NICU for a month.  I'm at almost 35 weeks now.  

I have so much to be grateful for.  I am grateful to be pregnant at all.  I am so happy that baby does not seem to be impacted by anything going wrong and is still growing properly.  I am grateful that baby did not show any abnormalities on any of his scans.  I am grateful we are in somewhat of a safe zone, as 35 weekers usually do well and rarely are disabled from premature birth.  I am grateful to be off work (I am a nurse, and could have been stuck running 12 hour shifts, but was taken off work for bad cramps whenever I lifted anything heavier than around 20ibs...which is a big part of the job where I am.  I went off before Coronavirus was a thing and have nine years of sick time to use up)  I am grateful that we are only planning one kid, so we will never, ever, have to do anything like this three-year reproduction rollercoaster again.  

But I feel so tired, and we didn't even do the c-section and recovery, or establishing breastfeeding, or newborn sleep deprivation yet!  I feel him wiggle and I'm happy.  Our nursery is ready.  Our families are excited.  I don't feel depressed or anything.  But I REALLY want him to show up healthy and safe ASAP.  I don't trust my body anymore.  I am just waiting for something else to go wrong.  I have a family member with a surprise pregnancy that is having smooth sailing and am astounded at her total confidence that everything will be totally okay.  

I am very round.  Moving is hard.  But the snow is finally melting (Canada) and I saw some green strawberry leaves and chives in the snow today.  I can waddle around my yard and smell the spring.  I am not really happy or sad.  I feel like I am in in a bubble where time isn't real.  Isolation means there is nothing to look forward to and nowhere to be.  My dishes are washed, my laundry caught up, my house is clean.  No demands of my time, no stress except worrying, can nap whenever I want.  It all feels very surreal.  It still doesn't feel like we'll get a baby out of this.  I've been pregnant before with no baby.  But I can feel the head pushing down and one of his heels leaning against the side of my womb.  Everything is very strange.

I look forward to reading everyone else's postings.  Every pregnancy experience is so different.  Every life is so different.  It is interesting to see where everyone is at."

> Kim Pagan, of Toms River, allegedly helped organize the small crowds that gathered in Trenton Friday to protest Gov. Phil Murphy's order essentially shutting down the state due to the virus -- which has infected nearly 80,000 people and killed almost 4,000 in just six weeks.

> A video posted to Facebook by Central Jersey Libertarians shows police writing summonses to honking and shouting protesters in parked cars. One woman can be heard to yell ""we have the right to peacefully protest!"" as an officer walks by a car with the word ""Playdemic"" written in the window.

> Earlier Friday, a small crowd of protesters, roughly one to two dozen in size, gathered in the parking lot of a Walmart in Hamilton, New Jersey. They brought cardboard signs, an American flag, and painted messages on vehicle windows parked next to their protest.

> ""MURPHY'S LAW WORSE THAN COVID-19,"" one window sign read.

> Gov. Murphy said his public schools would stay closed at least through May 15, in line with New York's latest extension for its ""Pause NY"" order.

> Murphy says his state has yet to hit a plateau; to help with the most critical cases, Cuomo said Thursday he'd send 100 ventilators across the river.

> As their frustration with life under lockdown grows, they’ve started to openly defy the social distancing rules in an effort to put pressure on governors to ease them.

**Article**:

> President Trump said Friday the federal government is investigating whether the novel coronavirus escaped from a Wuhan lab and pledged the U.S. government will find out how the deadly pandemic was unleashed from China.

> Asked about the accuracy of news stories -- reported first at Fox News -- that COVID-19 likely started spreading first from a Wuhan lab and not from a Chinese wet market, Trump signaled the U.S. is taking the matter seriously.

> ""We&apos;re looking at it. A lot of people are looking at it. It seems to make sense,"" Trump told reporters Friday at the White House.

> ""... There is a lot of investigation going on and we&apos;re going to find out,"" Trump said of the origin of COVD-19.

> Trump said the global pandemic could have been prevented had China taken action in the early days.

> ""All I can say is wherever it came from -- it came from China, in whatever form -- 184 countries are suffering because of it. And it&apos;s too bad, isn&apos;t it? It could have been solved very easily when it was just starting.""

> Trump&apos;s comments coincide with Fox News&apos; earlier reporting that the U.S. is conducting a full-scale investigation into whether the novel coronavirus, which went on to morph into a global pandemic that has brought the global economy to its knees, escaped from a lab in Wuhan, China.

> Intelligence operatives are said to be gathering information about the laboratory and the initial outbreak of the virus. Intelligence analysts are piecing together a timeline of what the government knew and “creating an accurate picture of what happened,” the sources said.

> CLICK HERE FOR COMPLETE CORONAVIRUS COVERAGE 

> Once that investigation is complete -- something that is expected to happen in the near-term -- the findings will be presented to the Trump administration. At that point, White House policymakers and Trump will use the findings to determine how to hold the country accountable for the pandemic.

> Fox News first reported on Wednesday that there is increasing confidence that the outbreak likely originated in a Wuhan lab, not as a bioweapon but as part of a Chinese effort to show that its efforts to identify and combat viruses are equal or greater than those of the U.S.

> U.S. officials and the intelligence community have confirmed to Fox News that they have taken the possibility of the coronavirus being man-made or engineered inside China as some sort of bioweapon off the table and have ruled it out at this point.

> Sources point to the structure of the virus, in saying the genome mapping specifically shows it was not genetically altered. The sources believe the initial transmission of the virus was a naturally occurring strain that was being studied there -- and then went into the population in Wuhan.

> Sources say the investigation of open source and classified data points to the work in the lab of Dr. Shi Zhengli, who was working on antivirals and immunizations for coronavirus, specifically with bats.

> SOURCES BELIEVE CORONAVIRUS OUTBREAK ORIGINATED IN WUHAN LAB AS PART OF CHINA&apos;S EFFORTS TO COMPETE WITH US

> U.S. officials are 100 percent confident China went to great lengths to cover up after the virus was out, the sources said.

> Additionally, the sources believe that the World Health Organization -- which the president paused funding to this week over its role in the crisis -- was either complicit in the cover-up, or looked the other way.

> Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on Friday reiterated that the administration was eyeing the Wuhan Institute of Virology and accused the Chinese government of stonewalling scientists from finding out what happened.

> “We know that the first sightings of this occurred within miles of the Wuhan Institute of Virology.  We know that this – the history of the facility, the first BSL-4 lab where there’s high-end virus research being conducted, took place at that site,” Pompeo said on the Hugh Hewitt Show. “We know that the Chinese Communist Party, when it began to evaluate what to do inside of Wuhan, considered whether the WIV was, in fact, the place where this came from.

> “And most importantly, we know they’ve not permitted the world’s scientists to go into that laboratory to evaluate what took place there, what’s happening there, what’s happening there even as we speak,” he said.

> Fox News’  Bret Baier Gillian Turner and Adam Shaw contributed to this report.

The first death came in the central Chinese city of Wuhan on Jan. 9. It took 83 days for the first 50,000 deaths to be recorded and just eight more for the toll to climb to 100,000. It took another eight days to go from 100,000 to 150,000.
The death toll is still far short of the so-called Spanish flu, which began in 1918 and is estimated to have killed more than 20 million people by the time it petered out in 1920.
The novel coronavirus is believed to have emerged in a Wuhan market where wild animals were sold before quickly spreading around the world. Much remains to be determined about it, scientists say, including just how lethal it is.
In many countries, official data includes only deaths reported in hospitals, not those in homes or nursing homes.
The United States has recorded the most confirmed cases of COVID-19, the respiratory illness caused by the coronavirus, with more than 680,000 detected infections. Spain is in second place with around 188,000 cases, followed by Italy."

The problem here, is that the Chinese have a continual habit of deliberately making misleading statements. So it's easy for people - who believe the WHO is just a voice piece for the CCP - to interpret this as the CCP saying: ""Just tell the world we've done some tests, and we've found no human-to-human transmission so far."""

Quite a few people are republican in theory but there's no movement to abolish the monarchy. 

Even if Scotland got independence, the Queen would still be Queen of Scotland. She is more Scottish than English, considering her mum's parents were Scottish nobility. 

The royal family (excluding those listed above) do a lot of good work for the country. Obviously there are official state engagements that help trade and politics. They do a huge amount of charity work too. The Queen went to visit a local charity that a friend is involved in. The PR they got gave them 2 years worth of normal funding within a few weeks. 

I think it's telling that as soon as people found out coronavirus was in the UK and hit elderly people hard, there were loads of social media posts about keeping the Queen safe. When we had the Brexit crisis, some people even wanted her to intervene. 

She gave a public broadcast about the lockdown. It was really well-recieved. I think 25 million watched it when it was broadcast, so more than a third of the population. It really was like your granny telling you eveything will be OK. 

People used to dislike Charles but he's become more popular. The Diana stuff was long ago. He was ridiculed for his stance on the environment for years but now everyone accepts he was right. I think that's improved his image.

William seems lovely. He is definitely modelling himself on the Queen. There's no ego, no acting spoilt, he just does his thing."

 Maior evento musical organizado até agora com gancho na quarentena imposta pelo coronavírus, o [festival One World: Together At Home](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/ilustrada/2020/04/lady-gaga-comanda-show-global-com-astros-para-combate-ao-coronavirus.shtml) acontece neste sábado (18) a partir das 15h (horário de Brasília) em diversas plataformas online e canais de TV.

 [Organizada por Lady Gaga](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/ilustrada/2020/04/se-voce-ouvir-vai-conhecer-meu-coracao-diz-lady-gaga-sobre-proximo-album.shtml) —que também deve se apresentar— e pela ONG Global Citizen, a transmissão especial terá shows de nomes de peso da história da música como o [ex-beatle Paul McCartney](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/ilustrada/2020/04/separacao-dos-beatles-chocava-o-mundo-ha-50-anos.shtml), os Rolling Stones, Stevie Wonder e Elton John —todos direto de suas respectivas casas, é claro.

 Também se apresentam [estrelas jovens do pop](https://f5.folha.uol.com.br/celebridades/2020/04/taylor-swift-e-oprah-se-unem-a-evento-para-homenagear-profissionais-de-saude-do-mundo.shtml) como Taylor Swift, Billie Eilish, Chris Martin e Alicia Keys, cantores latinos como Jennifer Lopez, Maluma e J Balvin e rappers como Lizzo, Usher e Awkwafina.

 Além disso, a live vai trazer aparições de celebridades como as apresentadoras Oprah Winfrey e Ellen DeGeneres, as atrizes Amy Poehler e Lupita Nyong’o e o casal David e Victoria Beckham.

 As lives [têm se multiplicado nesta época de quarentena](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/ilustrada/2020/04/na-era-do-coronavirus-tem-muita-live-para-pouco-olho-na-internet.shtml), mas nenhuma até hoje chegou perto de juntar essa quantidade de artistas de alto calibre em um mesmo evento.

  Como é promovida por uma ONG e conta com apoio da Organização Mundial da Saúde, é uma ocasião histórica comparável a outras reuniões de grandes estrelas em prol de causas nobres —dessa vez, o alerta é para que todos fiquem em casa e interrompam a disseminação do vírus.

 A ideia remonta ao [Live Aid de 1985](https://f5.folha.uol.com.br/voceviu/2020/04/fa-do-queen-recria-momento-iconico-de-freddie-mercury-no-live-aid-veja.shtml), apresentação seminal que juntou gente como Queen, Led Zeppelin, David Bowie e U2 para combater a fome em países africanos.

 De lá para cá, houve momentos como o Concert for Life, em 1992, que buscava conscientizar sobre a epidemia de Aids enquanto fazia tributo a Freddie Mercury, e o Live Earth de Al Gore, que em 2007 fez shows simultâneos em diversos continentes contra o aquecimento global.

 Além disso, o One World põe à prova todo o modelo das lives, já que certamente servirá de referência para balizar o engajamento do público nesse tipo de apresentação —seja como case de sucesso  
 ou de fracasso— e ajudará a mensurar qual vai ser o impacto dessas produções caseiras de escala global na indústria musical pós-coronavírus.

 Na TV, o megafestival será exibido por canais pagos e [pela Globo](https://f5.folha.uol.com.br/televisao/2020/04/globo-vai-transmitir-one-world-together-at-home-com-gaga-paul-mccartney-e-mais.shtml), com apresentação de Tiago Leifert —nos EUA, a programação terá como cicerones um punhado de anfitriões populares de talk shows, como Stephen Colbert, Jimmy Kimmel e Jimmy Fallon, e estará simultaneamente em várias emissoras.

 A programação brasileira do festival começa no Multishow e no Globoplay, às 15h. Os shows principais começam às 21h e passam na TV aberta após o fim do “Altas Horas”, com duas horas de duração.

 No domingo (19), é a vez de outro gigante: o [rei Roberto Carlos](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/ilustrada/2020/04/roberto-carlos-planeja-live-com-show-para-o-proximo-fim-de-semana.shtml) faz a primeira live de sua carreira, às 19h45, em seu canal do YouTube. A apresentação, que deve durar cerca de 45 minutos, vai ser transmitida ao vivo pelo Globoplay e as primeiras músicas passarão ao vivo também na TV Globo.

The US is also leading the world in total number of tests administered, at over 3.5 million. It's no wonder that our number of confirmed cases is so high. It is a wonder that we're outperforming Europe this badly.

Ohhh, you'll just believe anything.

Vocally said mutiple times he loves working with Fauci and would never fire him?


> for using the best available data to help guide our country's covid response?


So you hate that he's following all of Fauci's advice... you're a bit of a nut job.


> That his calls to ""liberate (insert state here)"" aren't a complete disregard for all public safety based on all the collective knowledge the world has amassed regarding the control of this virus?


Governors need to not act like jack booted thugs.   I know you love that sort of stuff, but it has no place in our society.  We need to respond as the science dictates, not like petty dictators.

Coronavirus/Covid-19 has nothing to do with physical fitness and exercise. 

- If you are looking for alternate workout routines, [the Recommended Routines page](https://thefitness.wiki/routines/) and ten years worth of past threads discussing that very thing exist. Nothing has changed about how you train from home, or without equipment, because of the pandemic.
- If you are looking to find out where you can buy home gym equipment, Google exists. More people are buying gym equipment now than at any other time in history. A business selling it does not benefit from making themselves hard for you to find.

Here's a set of answers to every other post about COVID-19:

- No, you are obviously not the only person who is afraid of it.
- No, your gym is not the only one that has closed, and nobody knows when they will open again.
- Yes, lots of people are probably not going to the gym, just like they're not going to everywhere else.
- Yes, you take the same precautions at the gym that you would take anywhere else.
- No, there is nothing random bozos from Reddit can tell you better than what the CDC et al are already saying.

It has gone down, and that is that.

With that, we have flattened the curve too, so I don't really get what your point is. Majority of the deaths also come from nursing homes, and they would almost certainly have died from coronavirus even if we locked down the country. Those deaths are painting our situation as even worse than it is. Deaths are deaths, but that was down to other problems rather than our tactic. 

Flattening the curve doesn't mean there are no new cases, and it will continue to go up for every country, whatever you say.

That it's impossible for some countries to get up to that amount is just BS. It will start to increase again, and we're just in the very beginning of it all. We're talking about weeks and a couple of months that this has been going on, but you really think they will be able to keep the curve so flat that they don't see those numbers in 1,5 years (at earliest) when a vaccine is here?

###Tips For Social Distancing, Quarantine, And Isolation During An Infectious Disease Outbreak

**What Is Social Distancing?**

Social distancing is a way to keep people from interacting closely or frequently enough to spread an infectious disease. Schools and other gathering places such as movie theaters may close, and sports events and religious services may be cancelled.

**What Is Quarantine?**

Quarantine separates and restricts the movement of people who have been exposed to a contagious disease to see if they become sick. It lasts long enough to ensure the person has not contracted an infectious disease.

**What Is Isolation?**

Isolation prevents the spread of an infectious disease by separating people who are sick from those who are not. It lasts as long as the disease is contagious.

##What To Expect: Typical Reactions

Everyone reacts differently to stressful situations such as an infectious disease outbreak that requires social distancing, quarantine, or isolation. People may feel:

- **Anxiety, worry, or fear related to**:  
- Your own health status  
- The health status of others whom you may have exposed to the disease  
- The resentment that your friends and family may feel if they need to go into quarantine as a result of contact with you  
- The experience of monitoring yourself, or being monitored by others for signs and symptoms of the disease  
- Time taken off from work and the potential loss of income and job security  
- The challenges of securing things you need, such as groceries and personal care items  
- **Concern** about being able to effectively care for children or others in your care  
- **Uncertainty or frustration** about how long you will need to remain in this situation, and uncertainty about the future  
- **Loneliness** associated with feeling cut off from the world and from loved ones  
- **Anger** if you think you were exposed to the disease because of others’ negligence  
- **Boredom and frustration** because you may not be able to work or engage in regular day-to-day activities  
- **Uncertainty or ambivalence** about the situation  
- **A desire** to use alcohol or drugs to cope  
- **Symptoms of depression**, such as feelings of hopelessness, changes in appetite, or sleeping too little or too much  
- **Symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD)**, such as intrusive distressing memories, flashbacks (reliving the event), nightmares, changes in thoughts and mood, and being easily startled.

##Ways To Support Yourself During Social Distancing, Quarantine, and Isolation

#UNDERSTAND THE RISK

Consider the real risk of harm to yourself and others around you. The public perception of risk during a situation such as an infectious disease outbreak is often inaccurate. Media coverage may create the impression that people are in immediate danger when really the risk for infection may be very low. Take steps to get the facts:

- Stay up to date on what is happening, while limiting your media exposure. Avoid watching or listening to news reports 24/7 since this tends to increase anxiety and worry. Remember that children are especially affected by what they hear and see on television.  
- Look to credible sources for information on the infectious disease outbreak.

#BE YOUR OWN ADVOCATE

Speaking out about your needs is particularly important if you are in quarantine, since you may not be in a hospital or other facility where your basic needs are met. Ensure you have what you need to feel safe, secure, and comfortable.

- Work with local, state, or national health officials to find out how you can arrange for groceries and toiletries to be delivered to your home as needed.  
- Inform health care providers or health authorities of any needed medications and work with them to ensure that you continue to receive those medications.

#EDUCATE YOURSELF

Health care providers and health authorities should provide information on the disease, its diagnosis, and treatment.

- Do not be afraid to ask questions—clear communication with a health care provider may help reduce any distress associated with social distancing, quarantine, or isolation.  
- Ask for written information when available.  
- Ask a family member or friend to obtain information in the event that you are unable to secure this information on your own.

#WORK WITH YOUR EMPLOYER TO REDUCE FINANCIAL STRESS

If you’re unable to work during this time, you may experience stress related to your job status or financial situation.

- Provide your employer with a clear explanation of why you are away from work.  
- Contact the U.S. Department of Labor tollfree at 1-866-487-2365 about the Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA), which allows U.S. employees up to 12 weeks of unpaid leave for serious medical conditions, or to care for a family member with a serious medical condition.  
- Contact your utility providers, cable and Internet provider, and other companies from whom you get monthly bills to explain your situation and request alternative bill payment arrangements as needed.

#CONNECT WITH OTHERS

Reaching out to people you trust is one of the best ways to reduce anxiety, depression, loneliness, and boredom during social distancing, quarantine, and isolation. You can:

- Use the telephone, email, text messaging, and social media to connect with friends, family, and others.  
- Talk “face to face” with friends and loved ones using Skype or FaceTime.  
- If approved by health authorities and your health care providers, arrange for your friends and loved ones to bring you newspapers, movies, and books.  
- Sign up for emergency alerts via text or email to ensure you get updates as soon as they are available.  
- Call SAMHSA’s free 24-hour Disaster Distress Helpline at 1-800-985-5990, if you feel lonely or need support.  
- Use the Internet, radio, and television to keep up with local, national, and world events.  
- If you need to connect with someone because of an ongoing alcohol or drug problem, consider calling your local Alcoholics Anonymous or Narcotics Anonymous offices.

#TALK TO YOUR DOCTOR

If you are in a medical facility, you may have access to health care providers who can answer your questions. However, if you are quarantined at home, and you’re worried about physical symptoms you or your loved ones may be experiencing, call your doctor or other health care provider:

- Ask your provider whether it would be possible to schedule remote appointments via Skype or FaceTime for mental health, substance use, or physical health needs.

#USE PRACTICAL WAYS TO COPE AND RELAX

- Relax your body often by doing things that work for you-take deep breaths, stretch, meditate or pray, or engage in activities you enjoy.  
- Pace yourself between stressful activities, and do something fun after a hard task.  
- Talk about your experiences and feelings to loved ones and friends, if you find it helpful.  
- Maintain a sense of hope and positive thinking; consider keeping a journal where you write down things you are grateful for or that are going well

We're among the best in the world. We have done so well that it is hypothetically possible for us to eliminate the coronavirus entirely from Australia. Hypothetically...

Or would you like to go outside in the next few months? Would you like some businesses to re-open? Would you like some people to start working again?

If we want to relax the lockdown even a little bit, we need a way to monitor and control the inevitable outbreaks of coronavirus that will start up.

* The government is going to make a big fuss of this virus to disguise the Brexit recession.

Now, all of a sudden (the change happened in mid-March):

* How dare anyone think the life of a 86 year-old with three terminal illnesses is something that can be compromised. Who needs employment or education anyway?

To ensure a good fit, you will need to get accurate measurements of the length and width of both of your feet.  

* [Most people (\~60% of the population) have one foot larger than the other](https://www.healthyfeetstore.com/different-sized-feet.html).
* Skates  can vary in both length and width within a given size designation, and  they can vary as much between models within a given brand as they would  between brands. For example, see [this comparison of Rollerblade's hardboot selection](https://www.inlinewarehouse.com/fitlc/brands/rollerblade-hardboot-insight.html)  \- the Twister Edge fits small & narrow, while the RB line (Cruiser,  RB80, RB110) fits larger and wide, despite both being  hardboot urban skates from the same company. Same with, for example, the  [Powerslide Imperials](https://www.powerslide.com/addons/mp_file_browser/files/downloads/Size%20Chart/PS-Urban-Imperials-DualFit.pdf) using different sizing intervals from the [Powerslide Nexts](https://www.powerslide.com/media/image/product/4055/lg/powerslide-next-renegade-125~8.jpg)  for their respective dual-fit sizing schemes - again, both are the   same  type of skates (hardboot urban skates) from the same company  (Powerslide), but the fit can be completely different (depending on  whether you are on the lower or upper end of a dual sizing range, in    addition to your actual foot dimensions).  
* For the same reason, it is generally ill-advised to rely on your normal shoe size to determine your skate sizing. Instead, refer to each brand's own sizing charts using your actual foot measurements.

In addition to sheer durability, modularity is useful in terms of replacing any parts that do wear-out or break.  

Many hardboot skates (Examples: [Twister Edge 110](https://www.rollerblade.com/products/twister-edge-110-3wd-2/?gp=15631&cp=15623) (for narrow/slim feet), [Maxxum Edge 125](https://www.rollerblade.com/products/maxxum-edge-125-3wd/?gp=15630&cp=15622) (for medium/average-width feet), and [RB110](https://www.rollerblade.com/products/rb-110-3wd-2/?gp=15631&cp=15623) (for wide feet)) will fit the description you've given, though some softboot skates (notably, the Swell Lite models from Powerslide - see [here](https://www.powerslide.com/Powerslide-Swell-Lite-Black-100), [here](https://www.powerslide.com/Powerslide-Swell-Lite-Blue-Grey-100), and [here](https://www.powerslide.com/Powerslide-Swell-Lite-Pink-Grey-90); the Swell line, in general, runs narrow, see sizing chart [here](https://www.powerslide.com/addons/mp_file_browser/files/downloads/Size%20Chart/PS-SWELL-Men.pdf)) approach the same level of modularity as hardboots by having removable liners (whereas most softboot skates, and some higher-end ""semi-soft"" boot skates have the lining permanently-integrated into the boot) while placing more emphasis on comfort over sheer durability."

2020-04-18,gts944,worldnews,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/g3jluf/growing_number_of_recovered_patients_testing/fns7ltj/,"MD here. Here's a copy paste of my comment about a similar article a few days ago -

It's because the RT-PCR test looks for fragments of the virus (RNA). It doesn't distinguish if the virus is dead or alive. We know that PCR test can be positive up to 37 days after symptom onset. BUT - viral cultures (the ability to actually grow live virus from a patient's sample) are only positive up to 8 days and with viral load being highest very early in the disease and subsequently decreasing. The negative tests also don't hold a lot of weight as the PCR tests are, at best, 70% sensitive - which leads to a significant number of false negatives. If the 7000 recovered pts in Korea were tested negative twice, we would expect 630 pts with false negative tests x2. They found 90 with neg x 2 then positive, which likely relates to either not having followed up each of the 7000 pts yet or that the likelyhood of a positive test decreases with time (people can be positive by PCR up to 37 days but average was ~11 days IIRC). The concern in this article is an artifact of testing.

There are viruses that can lay dormant and reactivate (the herpes family, for example) but I don't think we have any data to suggest that coronavirus does this."

In informal conversations, one hears the sentiment even from people I know to be fundamentally progressive and inclined to defer to whatever health officials say is responsible and necessary to mitigate the worst effects of coronavirus. It is possible both to support the shutdown and powerfully resent it—the draconian nature of the response, and the widespread perception that to voice skepticism of any aspect of its necessity is outside respectable bounds.

The stupidity and arrogance produced by the American education system in one paragraph. Wonderful.

That claim is of course nonsense, if you're angry at other people making healthcare decisions, then you shouldn't ever go to the doctor.

>  No solamente por el nuevo caso confirmado de coronavirus es que la provincia de Misiones se vio sacudida durante la jornada de ayer, sino también por registrar otro brutal caso de femicidio en el que una joven de 24 años resultó siendo quemada y enterrada dentro de una aldea mbya guaraní en la localidad de San Vicente.   
>  La nueva víctima de la violencia machista fue identificada como María Solange Diniz Rabela (24), quien residía en la aldea Taruma Poty junto a su concubino y además cacique de la comunidad, Marcelo Núñez (36), que desde ayer se encuentra detenido y a disposición de la Justicia como principal sospechoso.   
>  El caso ya habría sido perpetrado durante la noche del domingo, pero recién pudo ser descubierto en el transcurso de esta semana a partir de un pedido de ayuda a la Policía por parte de los familiares de la víctima, quienes ya sabían que la muchacha estaba sin vida pero no podían determinar las causales ni las circunstancias del deceso al comunicarse con los miembros de la aldea en cuestión.
> 
> De acuerdo a lo que pudo reconstruir El Territorio en base a fuentes cercanas a la investigación, durante esta semana el padrastro y la madre de la víctima se enteraron por intermedio de otros familiares que su hija había fallecido durante la noche del domingo y que incluso ya había sido sepultada en el cementerio de la comunidad, pero nunca pudieron obtener mayor información al respecto, por lo que decidieron acudir a la Policía en busca de ayuda.   
>  En esa misma presentación ante la Policía, los familiares de Rabela indicaron que la muchacha vivía en compañía del cacique de la aldea y además añadieron que era víctima de constantes maltratos por parte del hombre, cuestión que acrecentaba el preocupante panorama.  
>  A partir de ahí, los efectivos de la comisaría Primera de San Vicente y las autoridades del Juzgado de Instrucción Tres local dispusieron las primeras medidas. La verdad no tardó en descubrirse y en horrorizar a todos.
> 
> **Horror al descubierto**  
>  Las fuentes indicaron que a partir de las averiguaciones practicadas y la toma de testimoniales en la aldea pudieron establecer que efectivamente ese domingo se enteraron de la muerte de Rabela, que esa misma noche incluso fue quemada y enterrada por su concubino quien adujo que la joven había contraído Covid-19, el virus que mantiene al mundo en alerta.   
>  Con toda esta información sobre la mesa, la Justicia ordenó un allanamiento en la aldea donde residen aproximadamente 20 personas y que se encuentra ubicada en la picada Tambor de Tacuarí, en cercanías al kilómetro 1.274 de la ex ruta nacional 14.  
>  Dicho procedimiento fue ejecutado durante la jornada del jueves y las fuentes señalaron que en la vivienda del cacique apuntado los pesquisas encontraron varios elementos más que comprometedores, entre ellos, un serrucho con manchas compatibles con sangre, además de un trozo de tela y dos mantas con los mismos signos.   
>  Luego, en una zona de monte ubicado a unos 200 metros del asentamiento, los investigadores dieron con una cama de una plaza prácticamente incinerada en su totalidad y con restos de huesos presumiblemente humanos.   
>  Pero, como si fuera poco, eso no fue lo único hallado en la macabra escena, dado que a un costado de la cama constataron que había tierra removida y tras una breve inspección dieron con más restos óseos, que fueron inmediatamente exhumados y enviados a la morgue judicial para el correspondiente examen de autopsia.   
>  Sin embargo, mientras todo esto ocurría, en la aldea el principal implicado ya no estaba, pero afortunadamente fue hallado y detenido al poco tiempo.   
>  Las mismas fuentes señalaron que el cacique involucrado, que a pesar de su nombre de pila es más conocido como Claudio, fue localizado ayer por los efectivos de la División Investigaciones de la Unidad Regional VIII en la comunidad aborigen pai Antonio Martínez, ubicada en Fracrán, a unos 40 kilómetros del lugar del hecho.   
>  Desde ese momento, el implicado permanece privado de su libertad en una celda de la División Traslados de UR VIII y a disposición del Juzgado de Instrucción Tres de San Vicente, donde se instruye el expediente como femicidio, figura que prevé una pena de prisión perpetua.   
>  Fuentes consultadas señalaron que la joven no era de la comunidad y hace pocos meses había iniciado una relación con el implicado.
> 
> **Más casos**  
>  El reciente caso de femicidio es el segundo registrado en Misiones desde el inicio de las medidas de aislamiento y el tercero en lo que va del año, además de otras claras de situaciones de violencia de género que culminaron fallecidos que quedaron en medio de la denominada “línea de fuego”.   
>  El primer femicidio del año fue el de Sonia Cerpa (40), quien fue asesinada por su ex concubino en el paraje Dos Hermanas. La mujer fue degollada y masacrada a cuchillazos por Valdir “Cuerero” Prestes, que está detenido e imputado por femicidio.   
>  Luego, con la cuarentena ya en marcha, la otra víctima fue Lorena Barreto (32) en Puerto Libertad, quien recibió una estocada en el corazón después de una discusión con su pareja Roberto Rivero Medina (74), que también permanece detenido e imputado.   
>  En medio de estos casos y el recientemente registrado en San Vicente, otros hechos de violencia de género produjeron víctimas colaterales como Anacarla (una beba de dos meses) en Iguazú y Juan Farjat (31), encargado de la reserva natural privada en San Sebastián de la Selva de Comandante Andresito.

> ## Líneas de ayuda en medio del aislamiento   
> 
> 
> Está más que claro que en medio de las medidas de aislamiento que actualmente rigen en todo el país quedan muchas mujeres en situación de violencia de género que hoy están expuestas a un mayor riesgo.   
>  Ante este panorama, autoridades nacionales y de todas las provincias arbitraron diferentes mecanismos para acompañar y auxiliar a mujeres en peligro.   
>  En este contexto, se recuerda que a nivel país están habilitadas las líneas 911, 144 y 137 para pedir ayuda, al tiempo que en Misiones recientemente se habilitó una línea de WhatsApp (3764-249224) para el envío de mensajes de texto para aquellas personas que se ven imposibilitadas de visibilizar su situación a través de llamadas.  
>  Al margen de ello, también recomiendan diversos consejos para las personas que conozca a mujeres en situación de violencia de género que hoy estén atravesando la cuarentena junto a su agresor. Preguntarlas a diario cómo están, hacerlas saber que cuentan vos y acordar una palabra clave para utilizarla en caso de una emergencia y poder llamar al 911 a tiempo, son algunos ejemplos."

1 how many have had it and beaten it, or have antibodies against it (Unknown until testing). This could dramatically decrease the fatality rate

2. Will a vaccine be effective against the virus if it mutates/ how fast will it mutate and render our vaccine ineffective

3. On the logistics side, will it become a mandatory vaccine, or something like the flu vaccine. If the government is mandating ""You must take this or you cannot go back to work"", then you may have more problems than just the virus. (I am pro vaccine, I just want people to take it because they want to help those around them, not because Big Brother Gov forced them to)

4. More logistics: People are getting restless, and there tends to be an uptick in suicides during these depressions. We need to know if by continuing the lockdown, how many may take their own lives (or the lives of others) because of these conditions. Will the suicide rate outpace coronavirus deaths because of it. (For young people it probably will)

5. Treatments. There are many very promising treatments for the disease, many of which are going into clinical trial. We may not need to wait for a vaccine if we can mitigate the damage done. 

6. Herd immunity. We all laughed at sweden for this one, but they weren't going into forced quarantine. We should also look at how that plays out.

I am not advocating one way or the other right now. I am just pointing out the extra variables at play when people say ""We must wait for a vaccine!"" (Specifically at the Gates family. They have a shady history with their vaccines. I am pro vaccination, I'm just not big on what they do)

Normal will never be achieved. There will probably be new guidelines when we go back. Corona will not be going away, so we will have to learn to live with it."

2020-04-18,businessia,finance,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/finance/comments/g3n5ny/what_if_andrew_yang_was_right_mitt_romney_joining/fns7lip/,"If you can't read the article...POSTED BELOW  


 

As the U.S. is scrambling to deal with the forced shuttering of restaurants, bars, theaters, and other businesses, even some fiscally conservative Republicans agree that giving money directly to people might be the best response. Today, Senator Mitt Romney proposed sending every U.S. adult a $1,000 check to help with short-term obligations—rent, groceries, whatever it may be. The idea sounded familiar to followers of the 2020 Democratic primary race, specifically those who have watched the businessman Andrew Yang—who ran an outsider campaign based on what he sees as the need for universal basic income, or UBI.

I spoke with Yang two hours after Romney’s announcement to discuss the renewed push to give people money. The conversation that follows has been condensed for length and clarity.

**Adam Harris:** Your campaign’s central plank was the “freedom dividend.” Now Mitt Romney is saying we need to send Americans a $1,000 injection. Why was that freedom dividend so important to you?

**Andrew Yang:** We’ve been in the midst of the greatest winner-take-all economy in the history of the world for the past number of years, where the gains of continued progress and innovation have not been felt in the day-to-day lives of the vast majority of Americans. And that was only going to accelerate in the days ahead, as artificial intelligence leaves the lab, and more companies automate more of their activities. You can see it in the shuttering of 30 percent of stores in malls around the country. People don’t think about that as automation, because it’s not like a robot showed up to the mall. But those stores are closing because of Amazon. And Amazon’s fulfillment centers are wall-to-wall robots and machines. So to me, it was vitally necessary and *is* vitally necessary to rebalance the economy and have it work better for people and families.

**Harris:** These coronavirus closures will put a lot of Americans in financially precarious situations. Does a onetime injection of money help? Or is this something that needs to be continuous?

**Yang:** It would be immensely helpful right now in this time of crisis. I think it should be $1,000 per month of economic lockdown. And the CDC just announced that they’re advising against gatherings of 50-plus \[people\] for eight weeks. So we should be looking at a minimum of two months at $1,000 per person. But we don’t know if the world’s going to reopen in eight weeks. It’s unclear what data we would have that would enable the CDC or other policy makers to give us the all clear. So it should be $1,000 a month until this crisis is over. And obviously anyone who knows anything about me knows I think it should then just continue in perpetuity.

We should do this right now to help keep millions of American families above the waterline. Seventy-eight percent of Americans are already living paycheck to paycheck; almost half can’t afford an unexpected $400 bill—and that was before we shut down hundreds of thousands of businesses, not just bars and restaurants and theaters. If you look at the ripple effect of every canceled sporting event, every canceled conference; hotels are firing people right and left right now. You’re looking at, essentially, a negation of a significant proportion of our economic activity for a month. There’s really no effective way you can try and make workers whole that does not involve putting money into everyone’s hands.

And this is one thing I find ridiculous and frustrating when politicians talk about making people whole. It’s like, how do you make a parking attendant who just lost all of his shifts whole? You know, he’s not paying a payroll tax now.

**Harris:** To add to that, the gig economy has always been very insecure. Does providing people with a baseline of money add some security to the system?

**Yang:** I’m for a universal basic income of $1,000 a month in perpetuity for all American adults. I think it’s necessary in the face of how our economy has evolved where the vast majority of new jobs that are getting created are temp, gig, or contract jobs that get disappeared any moment, are precarious, and do not have any benefits attached to them, typically.

We should have universal health care for similar reasons. The fact is our employment-based health-care system is purely an accident, based on our experience in World War II, where there were pay caps and companies bolted on health insurance trying to attract workers. And now we’re stuck with this completely messed-up hodgepodge where your insurance is tied to a full-time job that exists for fewer and fewer Americans. Because again, most of the new jobs that are getting created are gig and contract jobs. So these are massive economic and social changes that we just have adapted to in a meaningful way. And this coronavirus crisis is going to be devastating for millions of Americans—socially, economically, physically. But a lot of these vulnerabilities existed prior to the coronavirus highlighting them.

[*Read: The coronavirus called America’s bluff*](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2020/03/coronavirus-showed-america-wasnt-task/608023/)

**Harris:** Even with Mitt Romney’s support, do you think it is something that Congress will do? Where do you place the likelihood of this happening?

**Yang:** I’m getting more and more encouraged. Because if you look, you see a range of economists from [Jason Furman](https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-case-for-a-big-coronavirus-stimulus-11583448500) to [Nouriel Roubini](https://thehill.com/homenews/house/487485-lawmakers-call-for-economic-stimulus-ubi-amid-coronavirus-crisis) coming out for it. Commentators from [Anand Giridharadas](https://twitter.com/AnandWrites/status/1237925856141611008) to [Geraldo Rivera](https://www.foxnews.com/media/geraldo-rivera-give1000-dollars-every-american-coronavirus-economy). And now with Mitt Romney coming out, you have Republicans as well as folks like AOC and Ro Khanna. So people are waking up to the common sense that the only way we’re going to help our people manage this crisis is by putting cold, hard cash into our hands as quickly as possible. I’m increasingly optimistic that common sense will prevail and Congress will pass this before too many lives fall apart.

**Harris:** So that groundswell of support is giving you that optimism?

**Yang:** It’s common sense. If you are any American who is exposed to any part of the economy, you see it’s being upended by the coronavirus. And you know there are limited ways that your neighbor or your co-worker or your former co-worker are going to be able to make ends meet—and you know that everything policy makers are talking about will be ineffective except for cash. The people know this. Politicians are quickly realizing it. And one reason I’m optimistic that it’s going to pass is: What is the political downside to giving everyone cash? I don’t see it. It’s like, you pass it and you look like a hero; you don’t pass it, you’re a moron. Even members of Congress can see that calculation.

**Harris:** And if you had one selling point to legislators who were still on the fence about this, what would that be?

**Yang:** You are going to be able to say to your constituents in your district: “I got money in your hands during this moment of need. When push came to shove, I came through for you.”

Salman took to Instagram, where he shared a 10-minute, hard-hitting video speaking about the Corona Warriors, who are putting themselves at risk in order to protect the nation. He also spoke about people who are putting everyone''s life at jeopardy by going out during the lockdown.
The clip starts with Salman''s signature ""Bigg Boss"" welcome. The actor then shared that he is stuck in his farmhouse, where he came to vacation for two days and ended up staying with his mother Salma Khan and his two sisters once the lockdown was imposed.
""I have my entire family here. My mother and sisters along with their kids are here. We have made a rule that those who are here cannot go out and no one can come in. Only go out to buy groceries,"" he said in Hindi.
Salman then strictly referred to the government''s stern order to follow the lockdown rules, including staying at home, and slammed those who are stepping out amid the lockdown.
He also talked about empathising with those who are COVID-19 positive.
""Not understanding the plight of those who are positive is ''anti-insaniyat'',"" he said.
""People who test positive soon understand that they had to keep safe. Those who are negative and not keeping safe will soon become positive. That''s a guarantee. Then, they will transmit it to their families and to the entire country,"" he added.
He said that those who wish to put their families to risk should definitely step out.
""You want to reduce the population of India? Starting with your own family?"" he said in the clip.
He then questioned those who are not listening to the government.
""If your actions were right then this lockdown would have ended by now, and the coronavirus too. If you weren''t going out with friends, police wouldn''t have hit with canes. Do you think the police is enjoying it?"" he admonished.
Salman also gave examples of those who are working in offices during the outbreak, and urged his fans to never step out to get food and medical supplies without a mask and gloves.
He asked spoke of the people who are taking a risk to step out and protect the nation in this hour of grave crisis.
""But they are still working for you,"" he said, adding: ""They are working to stop the spread because this disease is not discriminating on the basis of caste, creed or age.""
Salman said: ""Your duty is to stay at home and you are not even doing that! I know of a few people who never venture out but are now coming out. Police, doctors and bank people are putting their lives at stake for you. You are putting their lives at risk,"" he added.
""Doctors and nurses came to save you and you pelted stones at them? People who have tested positive are running away from hospitals? Where are you running? Towards life or death? I understand those who have nothing to eat or feed their children... Very good work is happening and it feels that the entire nation is working together.
""But because of some jokers this disease is spreading rapidly,"" he said.
Salman also tried reasoning about police resorting to violence. ""If your action wasn''t like that, the police wouldn''t have reacted that way. It (the virus) started China and ended too. But because of some people this will stay in India.""
The actor then urged all to respect those who are working to keep our lives safe.
""There are two sides of a story. This too has two sides. One side we all stay and the second is no one stays. you decide and thank police, doctors, nurses and bank people. Respect those who are suffering and keep safe, so that it doesn''t spread,"" he sais."

In the quadrennial election, held as scheduled on Wednesday despite the coronavirus pandemic, the DP and its sister Platform Party were estimated to have secured a combined 180 seats, or three-fifths of the total, in the 300-seat unicameral National Assembly, reports Yonhap News Agency.
This is nearly double the estimated 103 seats for the main opposition United Future Party (UFP) and its sister party Future Korea Party.
It also marks the biggest majority a party has claimed since the country adopted the direct presidential election system in 1987.
Of the 253 directly contested seats, the DP won 163 seats, followed by the UFP with 84 seats, the liberal Justice Party with one seat, and independent candidates with five seats, according to the results tallied when all votes were counted on Thursday morning.
Of the 47 proportional representation slots, the parties affiliated with the UFP and the DP won 33.8 and 33.4 per cent of the votes, respectively. The Justice Party, the People''s Party and the Open Democratic Party got 9.7 per cent, 6.8 per cent and 5.4 per cent, respectively.
This is expected to translate to 19 seats and 17 seats, respectively, for the UFP and DP''s sister parties, five seats for the Justice Party, three for the People''s Party and three for the Open Democratic Party.
The elections, held in the midst of South Korea''s battle against COVID-19, was seen as a referendum on President Moon Jae-in, who has two more years in office, reports the Yonhap news Agency.
Moon''s approval rating fell to the 30 per cent level at one point last year, hit by a prolonged economic slowdown and a political scandal involving former Justice Minister Cho Kuk.
But the government''s handling of the coronavirus crisis has changed public sentiment, as illustrated in recent polls in which Moon''s approval rating shot up to over 50 per cent.
South Korea has reported a caseload of nearly 10,600 since its first infection on January 20. It recorded fewer than 30 new virus cases for the third straight day on Wednesday.
The DP''s victory will enable Moon to manage state affairs stably during the rest of his single, five-year term.
With 180 seats, the ruling bloc would be able to fast-track the passage of bills without support from other parties.
The general elections, one of the world''s first elections to be held amid the coronavirus pandemic, was carried out with extra precautions.
The election watchdog prioritized safety to prevent potential exposure to the risk of infection.
Voters wearing face masks had their temperatures checked at the entrance. They disinfected their hands with sanitizers and put on plastic gloves before casting ballots.
To keep social distancing rules, voters were advised to stand at least 1 meter apart from others.
Despite the virus, more than 29 million voters hit the polls, resulting in a provisional voter turnout of 66.2 per cent, the highest in 28 years.
Turnout in early voting also hit a record 26.7 per cent."

It essentially blocks a subset of foreign travelers coming from regions within China thought to be at risk. Unfortunately it was both full of holes and lacked any serious enforcement. Travelers from other countries could have come in contact with Chinese tourists who'd been infected and thus a later restriction was placed on European travelers. The problem remained one of coordination though. My slapping these travel restrictions down without proper travel advisories and without a plan for repatriation, the administration created panic. This caused airport crowding and most likely furthered infection rates in hub cities like NY, Seattle, Chicago, etc. as travelers flooded in from Europe and elsewhere and were stuck in close quarters and entered the country without any screening, self-isolation procedures, or tracing.

Luckily, there’s television, which has the capacity to bring us to places more entertaining, and more engrossing, than we’re used to. Like, for instance … another house.

The latest installment of the Japanese reality show “Terrace House” premiered on Netflix last week, giving fans the long-awaited continuation of its Tokyo 2019-20 season. The show, which streams in more than 190 countries and whose cult following includes some of the Dodgers, follows a recognizable format: Six strangers live together in a beautiful house, and cameras watch what happens next.

The group, which is always comprised of three men and three women, possesses an envious combination of youth, talent and good looks. Lifelong friendships develop. Romance blooms. Drama unfolds.

The twist? As the show’s panelists, six television personalities fan the flames by poking fun at housemates in gossipy interludes. A misstep while living in the house might mean panelists bestow upon you an unflattering nickname you’ll wear for the rest of the season. (Just ask Tatsuya Uchihara, better known to fans as the guy at the heart of the “Meat Crime.”) These commentators, combined with the timeless entertainment of people-watching, have made “Terrace House” a reality TV favorite.


As actress and panelist You promises at the start of every episode, “All that we’ve provided is a beautiful home and automobiles. There is no script at all.” Like many other entries in the genre, though, “Terrace House” — whose dramatic charms work best when taken at face value — does follow a script, albeit an unwritten one: Play along with the storyline painted by showrunners and panelists, and reap the benefits of a successful “Terrace House” run. Break the spell by appearing to cash in on TV popularity and be shunned by panelists, housemates and fans alike.


In this way, “Terrace House” is a potent reminder of constant pressure we face to be (or at least seem) “authentic” in our daily lives — but it can be uncharitable in its treatment of those whose desires and ambitions it deems to be outside the rules. By suggesting, as actor and guest panelist Eiichiro Funakoshi noted this season, that the series “is one of the best opportunities to truly discover who you are,” it reveals how simplistic is reality TV’s conception of “the self” compared to our actual experience. And many of us have had no more time to ponder that self than right now, as we stay at home to slow the spread of the coronavirus.


Though “Terrace House” demands that housemates display purer motives, ignoring the benefits of being on the show is easier said than done. After participant and professional snowboarder Takayuki Nakamura gained free advertising by wearing his clothing brand on the show, “Terrace House” redditors started asking whether the company, Brew, takes international orders. Aspiring actors and models come on the show for similar reasons: Minori Nakada, who entered the house uncertain of her decision to pursue modeling, secured partnerships with the likes of Chloe and YSL; “Terrace House” alumna Lauren Tsai was cast in the third season of the FX show “Legion.”

While housemates may be aware of what a “Terrace House” stint can do for their careers, they have to remember that in the house they live as a person, not a brand. Basketball star Ryo Tawatari from the Tokyo 2019-20 season recently came under fire from housemates and panelists who suspected that his self-image, not his sport, were what motivated most of his actions in the house. He cut short a blossoming romance with housemate Violetta Razdumina, in what was theorized to be a move aimed at not upsetting his admirers outside the house. Once seen as likable and mature, Ryo quickly lost favor for his apparently calculated actions.


This isn’t the first time insincerity has been sniffed out in the house. Earlier seasons of the show, “Opening New Doors” and “Boys and Girls in the City,” ended on truly sensational notes when secret, off-camera relationships were revealed between castmates. In each case, panelists came to the same sexist conclusion: The women involved had a vested interest in projecting a more innocent (read: romantically and sexually inexperienced) image of themselves on television than was actually the case.


Although “Terrace House” confronts more extreme examples of performance, it turns out that our actions in real life might not be as unscripted as we think. The way we dress, the culture we consume, our resting face and even the luxury face mask that might cover it all demonstrate the mundane ways we perform good taste or self-security or poise for ourselves and one another. Embarrassingly, we perform even when the stakes are much lower, without the thought of overseas markets or French luxury brands knocking on our doors. Yet it’s enough to make us think twice about how we come off on our Instagram or Twitter feeds.


Though “Terrace House” panelists may frame such calculations as a form of falseness, projecting the image of put-togetherness isn’t necessarily a lie. Certainly, it’s no less “authentic” than following the unwritten script of a popular reality show. Rather, it’s a glimpse into a hopeful future. Isn’t who we want to be part of who we are?


A winning formula, in life if not always on “Terrace House,” might involve a more forgiving way of thinking about who we are — one that acknowledges that the self we show to others is not as much a façade as a revelation of who we hope to become."

Christians are heavily...let's call it ""encouraged""...to listen to the authorities in the hierarchy and the movement.  The Catholics look to the Pope.  Protestants look to certain celebrity pastors and/or theologians (John McArthur, John Piper, RC Sproul, and numerous other names come to mind...as well as their own pastors and elders).  As such, they often look to any figures they deem as having authority within this structure (their Sunday School teacher, worship leader, deacons, etc.) as being someone who should be emulated and listened to.  And beyond this, women specifically also give certain deference to ""authority"" figures within the movement like Beth Moore and even Joyce Meyers.  

So when one becomes used to being told to trust authority figures and then your Sunday school teacher or an upstanding deacon or your worship leader is pitching an MLM like Essential Oils, the natural skepticism that most people have (and that everyone should have) is just not there.  So they get fooled easily.  This is why MLM's of all kinds of stripes proliferate among Christians.  

It also adds fuel to the fire that Christians are told that it's good to be evangelical about what they believe in.  Many people might never turn that into creating witnessing encounters for the faith but yet they can take what they've been told is a good thing (proselytizing) and use it to push these MLM's like crazy.  This isn't just my opinion.  I don't have time to scope any out, but I know (because I've seen some of them) that studies have been done on the effects of  both of these Christian tendencies (believing authority figures and evangelistic zeal) when it comes to MLM's spreading in the Christian ranks like...well...you know what's coming...Coronavirus."

Simple fact is patient zero was infected in november and there were just over a dozen cases in China by december. There is simply no way it was transatlantic when you were sick. Let alone prolific enough that multiple people could be sick in the same hospital.

This is borne out by the fact that we did not see a rush of need for ICU beds and ventilators until late March. It's not like there was some special low impact version of the virus going around."

> WORKING ON DEVICES ON LOAN IN A RENTAL FLAT
> 
> A 14-year-old boy is sitting cross-legged on the floor, looking at his tablet loaned from school. A nine-year-old is sprawled on his belly, doing his homework on the floor.
> 
> Their other two siblings, a girl aged 12 and a boy aged 11, are seated at a small table against the wall in the two-room rental flat, doing their HBL.
> 
> The four children share three devices among them for HBL. The family have a laptop which they bought at a subsidised rate through a government scheme for low-income households. There is a laptop and a tablet, both on loan from school for HBL.
> 
> While the three devices are sufficient for the children's HBL needs, which include hard copy worksheets and online assignments, the family, who do not have a household Wi-Fi subscription, has problems with connectivity.
> 
> The children's mother, Madam Salmiah Salam, 37, uses a dongle, donated by a charity, to turn her smartphone into a Wi-Fi hot spot, but it is not working properly. The patchy Internet access means online work for HBL slows from time to time.
> 
> The housewife, who left school after her N levels, is finding HBL stressful.
> 
> She says: ""I have to teach my children. If they don't understand the work, I have to explain it to them. But sometimes I myself don't understand the concept. I go to YouTube to find out more.""
> 
> She has been refreshing her knowledge of factors and multiples alongside her youngest child, Muhammad Hadiputra Hashim, who is in Primary 4.
> 
> She says: ""I wish my kids had a more conducive study environment. Then at least they can be more engaged learners. But we lack space, so we make do with what we have.""
> 
> The family's sparsely furnished rental flat in Redhill comprises a hall, a kitchen and a bedroom. They usually have dinner together on the floor in the hall.
> 
> During this period when schools are closed and the afternoons stretch lazily, the children have been taking more naps than usual on pillows strewn on the floor.
> 
> Another source of stress for Madam Salmiah and her 56-year-old husband is that he is out of work.
> 
> Mr Hashim Kamid, the sole breadwinner, quit his job as a cleaner at a condominium at the end of February. He feared bringing the coronavirus into his home after a day of cleaning lifts and other surfaces.
> 
> A few years ago, after his operation for an infected stomach ulcer, his doctor had also advised the former rubbish collector to work in a more hygienic environment.
> 
> He was earning about $1,100 a month. Ms Salmiah has been taking her few pieces of jewellery to the pawnshop in the past month.
> 
> ""We did this before. Hashim was retrenched when the children were younger,"" she says.
> 
> She was too ""paiseh"" (Hokkien for embarrassed) to ask for help. But Beyond Social Services, which has supported the family before, asked if she needed assistance during the Covid-19 outbreak.
> 
> The charity, which helps children and young people from less privileged backgrounds, has provided her with $150 for groceries and is processing more financial aid for the family.
> 
> The Solidarity Payment, a $600 cash payout for adult Singaporeans to cope with the pandemic, has also eased her burden, she says.
> 
> The couple hope normalcy will return soon and that Mr Hashim finds another job.
> 
> In the meantime, they try to find some light-heartedness in the situation.
> 
> Mr Hashim, who has been cooking more, is not used to being around his four children 24/7. He recently asked his wife how she could tahan (Malay for tolerate) being with the children all day long.
> 
> GLAD FOR A FREE LAPTOP UNDER IMDA ASSISTANCE SCHEME
> 
> Sheryl Shivani, 17, had been dreading the start of full-time HBL.
> 
> Worried about not being able to keep up with studying for her O levels this year, she remembers the disastrous unfolding of a recent e-assignment she did on her smartphone, a device that is not suited for HBL.
> 
> It was tedious opening multiple tabs on her mobile phone, which could not support all the features she needed for the lesson. She could not finish her history assignment in the end.
> 
> She resolved to save up for a laptop of her own by skipping lunch at school.
> 
> ""I didn't want to share my feelings, as I was embarrassed and sad. I would spend my lunch-time chilling out with my friends and go home to eat,"" says Sheryl, who is in Secondary 5.
> 
> Neither did she want to ask her mother, a single parent, to buy the gadget for her.
> 
> ""I know Mummy's situation and how hard she needs to work for us. I saved up a few years ago to buy my mobile phone. I'm good at saving money,"" she says.
> 
> Her mother, Ms Cynthia Jyanthi, who declined to give her age, is a nurse at a nursing home.
> 
> She communicated her anxiety about Sheryl's lack of a laptop to her teacher.
> 
> ""I work long hours. While I may be able to sit with them for a while, I cannot follow through. I do ask them if they need any help and I've been interacting with their teachers,"" says Ms Cynthia, who also has two sons.
> 
> Her younger son, Secondary 1 student Gerald Giresh Raj, 13, is using a laptop on loan from his school for HBL, while her older son, 19, is waiting to enlist in national service.
> 
> Ms Cynthia's 68-year-old mother, who had a cardiac arrest in recent months and uses a wheelchair, also lives with her.
> 
> Luckily, help arrived when Sheryl's teacher notified her of the NEU PC Plus programme, which is administered by Infocomm Media Development Authority (IMDA).
> 
> It offers low-income households and persons with disabilities the opportunity to own a computer at a subsidised rate. Successful applicants get a desktop or laptop and three years' free broadband subscription.
> 
> Ms Koh Li-Na, assistant chief executive for IMDA's Digital Readiness Cluster, says: ""Since circuit breaker measures were announced on April 3, we have seen an increase of more than fivefold in the number of inquiries.""
> 
> She attributes the rocketing interest to expanded support for students under the Ministry of Education's (MOE) Financial Assistance Scheme.
> 
> Because Sheryl met the criteria for the MOE scheme, she received a free laptop last week.
> 
> HBL is a breeze for her now and she spends less time on her online work.
> 
> ""With this new laptop, I've learnt a few things like how to use MS Word and how to submit assignments via Google Classroom. It's much faster,"" she gushes.
> 
> ""I'm amazed that I have my own laptop to use. Finally, I can do something that my friends had been doing all this time."""

Regardless of how much you hate Trump, and regardless of coronavirus being potentially dangerous, no one is admitting that this headline is scary.

* You are required to file a tax return, but:
   * We haven't finished processing your 2019 return
   * You haven’t filed your 2019 tax return and didn’t have direct deposit information on your 2018 return
   * The application doesn't yet have your data; we’re working on adding more data to allow more people to use it.
* You don't usually file a return, and:
   * You used Non-Filers: Enter Payment Info Here but we haven’t processed your entry yet
   * You receive an SSA or RRB Form 1099 or SSI or VA benefits; information has not been loaded onto our systems yet for people who don’t normally file a tax return.

""The order also notes large stores must close off areas of stores meant for carpeting, flooring, furniture, gardening and paint. The limits only apply to in-person sales and do not apply to stores with less than 50,000 square feet.""
Now, you can still order these things online so they are not banned, that being said,  I doubt ordering a majority of the items listed is either economical or expeditious. Again, no science went into this. Why just these parts of the store? If the store is open why not keep the whole store open?

###Tips For Social Distancing, Quarantine, And Isolation During An Infectious Disease Outbreak

**What Is Social Distancing?**

Social distancing is a way to keep people from interacting closely or frequently enough to spread an infectious disease. Schools and other gathering places such as movie theaters may close, and sports events and religious services may be cancelled.

**What Is Quarantine?**

Quarantine separates and restricts the movement of people who have been exposed to a contagious disease to see if they become sick. It lasts long enough to ensure the person has not contracted an infectious disease.

**What Is Isolation?**

Isolation prevents the spread of an infectious disease by separating people who are sick from those who are not. It lasts as long as the disease is contagious.

##What To Expect: Typical Reactions

Everyone reacts differently to stressful situations such as an infectious disease outbreak that requires social distancing, quarantine, or isolation. People may feel:

- **Anxiety, worry, or fear related to**:  
- Your own health status  
- The health status of others whom you may have exposed to the disease  
- The resentment that your friends and family may feel if they need to go into quarantine as a result of contact with you  
- The experience of monitoring yourself, or being monitored by others for signs and symptoms of the disease  
- Time taken off from work and the potential loss of income and job security  
- The challenges of securing things you need, such as groceries and personal care items  
- **Concern** about being able to effectively care for children or others in your care  
- **Uncertainty or frustration** about how long you will need to remain in this situation, and uncertainty about the future  
- **Loneliness** associated with feeling cut off from the world and from loved ones  
- **Anger** if you think you were exposed to the disease because of others’ negligence  
- **Boredom and frustration** because you may not be able to work or engage in regular day-to-day activities  
- **Uncertainty or ambivalence** about the situation  
- **A desire** to use alcohol or drugs to cope  
- **Symptoms of depression**, such as feelings of hopelessness, changes in appetite, or sleeping too little or too much  
- **Symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD)**, such as intrusive distressing memories, flashbacks (reliving the event), nightmares, changes in thoughts and mood, and being easily startled.

##Ways To Support Yourself During Social Distancing, Quarantine, and Isolation

#UNDERSTAND THE RISK

Consider the real risk of harm to yourself and others around you. The public perception of risk during a situation such as an infectious disease outbreak is often inaccurate. Media coverage may create the impression that people are in immediate danger when really the risk for infection may be very low. Take steps to get the facts:

- Stay up to date on what is happening, while limiting your media exposure. Avoid watching or listening to news reports 24/7 since this tends to increase anxiety and worry. Remember that children are especially affected by what they hear and see on television.  
- Look to credible sources for information on the infectious disease outbreak.

#BE YOUR OWN ADVOCATE

Speaking out about your needs is particularly important if you are in quarantine, since you may not be in a hospital or other facility where your basic needs are met. Ensure you have what you need to feel safe, secure, and comfortable.

- Work with local, state, or national health officials to find out how you can arrange for groceries and toiletries to be delivered to your home as needed.  
- Inform health care providers or health authorities of any needed medications and work with them to ensure that you continue to receive those medications.

#EDUCATE YOURSELF

Health care providers and health authorities should provide information on the disease, its diagnosis, and treatment.

- Do not be afraid to ask questions—clear communication with a health care provider may help reduce any distress associated with social distancing, quarantine, or isolation.  
- Ask for written information when available.  
- Ask a family member or friend to obtain information in the event that you are unable to secure this information on your own.

#WORK WITH YOUR EMPLOYER TO REDUCE FINANCIAL STRESS

If you’re unable to work during this time, you may experience stress related to your job status or financial situation.

- Provide your employer with a clear explanation of why you are away from work.  
- Contact the U.S. Department of Labor tollfree at 1-866-487-2365 about the Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA), which allows U.S. employees up to 12 weeks of unpaid leave for serious medical conditions, or to care for a family member with a serious medical condition.  
- Contact your utility providers, cable and Internet provider, and other companies from whom you get monthly bills to explain your situation and request alternative bill payment arrangements as needed.

#CONNECT WITH OTHERS

Reaching out to people you trust is one of the best ways to reduce anxiety, depression, loneliness, and boredom during social distancing, quarantine, and isolation. You can:

- Use the telephone, email, text messaging, and social media to connect with friends, family, and others.  
- Talk “face to face” with friends and loved ones using Skype or FaceTime.  
- If approved by health authorities and your health care providers, arrange for your friends and loved ones to bring you newspapers, movies, and books.  
- Sign up for emergency alerts via text or email to ensure you get updates as soon as they are available.  
- Call SAMHSA’s free 24-hour Disaster Distress Helpline at 1-800-985-5990, if you feel lonely or need support.  
- Use the Internet, radio, and television to keep up with local, national, and world events.  
- If you need to connect with someone because of an ongoing alcohol or drug problem, consider calling your local Alcoholics Anonymous or Narcotics Anonymous offices.

#TALK TO YOUR DOCTOR

If you are in a medical facility, you may have access to health care providers who can answer your questions. However, if you are quarantined at home, and you’re worried about physical symptoms you or your loved ones may be experiencing, call your doctor or other health care provider:

- Ask your provider whether it would be possible to schedule remote appointments via Skype or FaceTime for mental health, substance use, or physical health needs.

#USE PRACTICAL WAYS TO COPE AND RELAX

- Relax your body often by doing things that work for you-take deep breaths, stretch, meditate or pray, or engage in activities you enjoy.  
- Pace yourself between stressful activities, and do something fun after a hard task.  
- Talk about your experiences and feelings to loved ones and friends, if you find it helpful.  
- Maintain a sense of hope and positive thinking; consider keeping a journal where you write down things you are grateful for or that are going well

I found moving by ourselves to be insanely stressful, and since I was already potentially exposed to coronavirus in a dirty rental van, I don’t know that it would have made a difference if we hired movers. Times are already stressful enough, so if you can afford it, I’d just hire movers, try to keep your distance, and let your stuff sit in it’s boxes for a couple days before unpacking to make sure that your stuff is safe from coronavirus exposure. If you’re like me and can’t afford movers, bring disinfectant if you rent a van or truck."

This does not mean they need to take the 10 weeks as a solid slot of time, it can mean when they don't have childcare for a day or two, as well as weeks at a time. 

The FFCRA is already, in my opinion, biased towards parents, it's just a bad move on the company's part to admit such favor towards parents when their out could've just been the act.

Your Name is an anime movie about two teenagers in Japan named Taki and Mitshua who begin to swap bodies one day. That's the setup, and they eventually realize they love each other. But when they try to meet up...there's a crazy event that I won't get into because spoilers.

AMAZING movie. Watch it on the biggest screen you have, preferably in a dark room. I'd like to say go watch it in a theater, but a. Coronavirus, and b. it was released in 2016, so even without the virus you wouldn't be able to see it. Anyhow, the visuals are gorgeous and enhance the viewing of the movie (tbh, same goes for 1917 and Parasite though). The ost and soundtrack is amazing. The Japanese title is ""Kimi no na wa"". 

There is a ""prequel but not a prequel"" called a Garden of Words released made by the same guy and takes place in the same universe, but the connection between the two movies is only a single cameo for the heroine of GOW in Your Name. It's a gorgeous movie too, but I found the plot weak. The ""sequel but not a sequel"", Weathering With You is similar, with cameos of Taki and Mitsuha in it, but there's no order to what you should watch it in and it really makes no difference whether you watch just one, two, all three, in any order. Once again, Weathering With You wasn't as good as Your Name imo. You can watch the two if you like, but I won't recommend it as strongly as Your Name. I can go on a whole tangent about what I think of movies and stuff, but I'll end it here.

Anyways, WATCH YOUR NAME. The movie is amazing. Heh, in my opinion, if you don't cry a little while watching this movie you have no heart."

Here, add this the your post history. The tests are bullshit.

[From “CDC 2019-Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) Real-Time RT-PCR Diagnostic Panel”](https://www.fda.gov/media/134922/download)

“Detection of viral RNA may not indicate the presence of infectious virus or that 2019-nCoV is the causative agent for clinical symptoms.”

&amp;gt;Translation: A positive test doesn’t guarantee that the COVID virus is causing infection at all. And, ahem, reading between the lines, maybe the COVID virus might not be in the patient’s body at all, either.

[From the World Health Organization (WHO): “Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) technical guidance: Laboratory testing for 2019-nCoV in humans”](https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/technical-guidance/laboratory-guidance)

“Several assays that detect the 2019-nCoV have been and are currently under development, both in-house and commercially. Some assays may detect only the novel virus [COVID] and some may also detect other strains (e.g. SARS-CoV) that are genetically similar.”

&amp;gt;Translation: Some PCR tests register positive for types of coronavirus that have nothing to do with COVID—including plain old coronas that cause nothing more than a cold.

&amp;gt;The WHO document adds this little piece: “Protocol use limitations: Optional clinical specimens for testing has [have] not yet been validated.”

&amp;gt;Translation: We’re not sure which tissue samples to take from the patient, in order for the test to have any validity.

[From the FDA: “LabCorp COVID-19RT-PCR test EUA Summary: ACCELERATED EMERGENCY USE AUTHORIZATION (EUA) SUMMARYCOVID-19 RT-PCR TEST (LABORATORY CORPORATION OF AMERICA)”](https://www.fda.gov/media/136151/download)

“…The SARS-CoV-2RNA [COVID virus] is generally detectable in respiratory specimens during the acute phase of infection. Positive results are indicative of the presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA; clinical correlation with patient history and other diagnostic information is necessary to determine patient infection status…THE AGENT DETECTED MAY NOT BE THE DEFINITE CAUSE OF DISEASE (CAPS are mine). Laboratories within the United States and its territories are required to report all positive results to the appropriate public health authorities.”

&amp;gt;Translation: On the one hand, we claim the test can “generally” detect the presence of the COVID virus in a patient. But we admit that “the agent detected” on the test, by which we mean COVID, “may not be the definite cause of disease.” We also admit that, unless the patient has an acute infection, we can’t find COVID. Therefore, the idea of “asymptomatic patients” confirmed by the test is nonsense. And even though a positive test for COVID may not indicate the actual cause of disease, all positive tests must be reported—and they will be counted as “COVID cases.” Regardless.

[From a manufacturer of PCR test kit elements, Creative Diagnostics, “SARS-CoV-2 Coronavirus Multiplex RT-qPCR Kit”](https://www.creative-diagnostics.com/sars-cov-2-coronavirus-multiplex-rt-qpcr-kit-277854-457.htm)

“Regulatory status: For research use only, not for use in diagnostic procedures.”

&amp;gt;Translation: Don’t use the test result alone to diagnose infection or disease. Oops.

“non-specific interference of Influenza A Virus (H1N1), Influenza B Virus (Yamagata), Respiratory Syncytial Virus (type B), Respiratory Adenovirus (type 3, type 7), Parainfluenza Virus (type 2), Mycoplasma Pneumoniae, Chlamydia Pneumoniae, etc.”

&amp;gt;Translation: Although this company states the test can detect COVID, it also states the test can read FALSELY positive if the patient has one of a number of other irrelevant viruses in his body. What is the test proving, then? Who knows? Flip a coin.

“Application Qualitative”

&amp;gt;Translation: This clearly means the test is not suited to detect how much virus is in the patient’s body. 

“The detection result of this product is only for clinical reference, and it should not be used as the only evidence for clinical diagnosis and treatment. The clinical management of patients should be considered in combination with their symptoms/signs, history, other laboratory tests and treatment responses. The detection results should not be directly used as the evidence for clinical diagnosis, and are only for the reference of clinicians.”

&amp;gt;Translation: Don’t use the test as the exclusive basis for diagnosing a person with COVID. And yet, this is exactly what health authorities are doing all over the world. All positive tests must be reported to government agencies, and they are counted as COVID cases.”"

Is a company that once added value to the world going to be not able to add that same value after we’re done with COVID? Is some new company just going to rise from the ashes to, for example, make airplanes/run an airline? No, it’s obviously still going to be the companies we still have.

I think any reaction to COVID is an overreaction. People are bullish because companies are still valuable and are going to continue to produce the value they once did in the long term - it’s not like someone is going to replace them."

To that end we are requiring that all comments be a minimum of 5,000 characters to ensure that there is a safe distance between users at all times. Please help us by ensuring that your commentary meets this minimum requirement. Attempts to circumvent this will see users quarantined from the subreddit. 

###Tips For Social Distancing, Quarantine, And Isolation During An Infectious Disease Outbreak

**What Is Social Distancing?**

Social distancing is a way to keep people from interacting closely or frequently enough to spread an infectious disease. Schools and other gathering places such as movie theaters may close, and sports events and religious services may be cancelled.

**What Is Quarantine?**

Quarantine separates and restricts the movement of people who have been exposed to a contagious disease to see if they become sick. It lasts long enough to ensure the person has not contracted an infectious disease.

**What Is Isolation?**

Isolation prevents the spread of an infectious disease by separating people who are sick from those who are not. It lasts as long as the disease is contagious.

##What To Expect: Typical Reactions

Everyone reacts differently to stressful situations such as an infectious disease outbreak that requires social distancing, quarantine, or isolation. People may feel:

- **Anxiety, worry, or fear related to**:  
- Your own health status  
- The health status of others whom you may have exposed to the disease  
- The resentment that your friends and family may feel if they need to go into quarantine as a result of contact with you  
- The experience of monitoring yourself, or being monitored by others for signs and symptoms of the disease  
- Time taken off from work and the potential loss of income and job security  
- The challenges of securing things you need, such as groceries and personal care items  
- **Concern** about being able to effectively care for children or others in your care  
- **Uncertainty or frustration** about how long you will need to remain in this situation, and uncertainty about the future  
- **Loneliness** associated with feeling cut off from the world and from loved ones  
- **Anger** if you think you were exposed to the disease because of others’ negligence  
- **Boredom and frustration** because you may not be able to work or engage in regular day-to-day activities  
- **Uncertainty or ambivalence** about the situation  
- **A desire** to use alcohol or drugs to cope  
- **Symptoms of depression**, such as feelings of hopelessness, changes in appetite, or sleeping too little or too much  
- **Symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD)**, such as intrusive distressing memories, flashbacks (reliving the event), nightmares, changes in thoughts and mood, and being easily startled.

##Ways To Support Yourself During Social Distancing, Quarantine, and Isolation

#UNDERSTAND THE RISK

Consider the real risk of harm to yourself and others around you. The public perception of risk during a situation such as an infectious disease outbreak is often inaccurate. Media coverage may create the impression that people are in immediate danger when really the risk for infection may be very low. Take steps to get the facts:

- Stay up to date on what is happening, while limiting your media exposure. Avoid watching or listening to news reports 24/7 since this tends to increase anxiety and worry. Remember that children are especially affected by what they hear and see on television.  
- Look to credible sources for information on the infectious disease outbreak.

#BE YOUR OWN ADVOCATE

Speaking out about your needs is particularly important if you are in quarantine, since you may not be in a hospital or other facility where your basic needs are met. Ensure you have what you need to feel safe, secure, and comfortable.

- Work with local, state, or national health officials to find out how you can arrange for groceries and toiletries to be delivered to your home as needed.  
- Inform health care providers or health authorities of any needed medications and work with them to ensure that you continue to receive those medications.

#EDUCATE YOURSELF

Health care providers and health authorities should provide information on the disease, its diagnosis, and treatment.

- Do not be afraid to ask questions—clear communication with a health care provider may help reduce any distress associated with social distancing, quarantine, or isolation.  
- Ask for written information when available.  
- Ask a family member or friend to obtain information in the event that you are unable to secure this information on your own.

#WORK WITH YOUR EMPLOYER TO REDUCE FINANCIAL STRESS

If you’re unable to work during this time, you may experience stress related to your job status or financial situation.

- Provide your employer with a clear explanation of why you are away from work.  
- Contact the U.S. Department of Labor tollfree at 1-866-487-2365 about the Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA), which allows U.S. employees up to 12 weeks of unpaid leave for serious medical conditions, or to care for a family member with a serious medical condition.  
- Contact your utility providers, cable and Internet provider, and other companies from whom you get monthly bills to explain your situation and request alternative bill payment arrangements as needed.

#CONNECT WITH OTHERS

Reaching out to people you trust is one of the best ways to reduce anxiety, depression, loneliness, and boredom during social distancing, quarantine, and isolation. You can:

- Use the telephone, email, text messaging, and social media to connect with friends, family, and others.  
- Talk “face to face” with friends and loved ones using Skype or FaceTime.  
- If approved by health authorities and your health care providers, arrange for your friends and loved ones to bring you newspapers, movies, and books.  
- Sign up for emergency alerts via text or email to ensure you get updates as soon as they are available.  
- Call SAMHSA’s free 24-hour Disaster Distress Helpline at 1-800-985-5990, if you feel lonely or need support.  
- Use the Internet, radio, and television to keep up with local, national, and world events.  
- If you need to connect with someone because of an ongoing alcohol or drug problem, consider calling your local Alcoholics Anonymous or Narcotics Anonymous offices.

#TALK TO YOUR DOCTOR

If you are in a medical facility, you may have access to health care providers who can answer your questions. However, if you are quarantined at home, and you’re worried about physical symptoms you or your loved ones may be experiencing, call your doctor or other health care provider:

- Ask your provider whether it would be possible to schedule remote appointments via Skype or FaceTime for mental health, substance use, or physical health needs.

#USE PRACTICAL WAYS TO COPE AND RELAX

- Relax your body often by doing things that work for you-take deep breaths, stretch, meditate or pray, or engage in activities you enjoy.  
- Pace yourself between stressful activities, and do something fun after a hard task.  
- Talk about your experiences and feelings to loved ones and friends, if you find it helpful.  
- Maintain a sense of hope and positive thinking; consider keeping a journal where you write down things you are grateful for or that are going well

In 2015 I went from a 2004 tarptent (that my wife and I used to hike the AT in 2005) to a tarp that I sewed in 2001. Then in 2017 I sewed the white tarp.

Title: My job laid off 120 workers, claimed it was ""coronavirus"" related, but I'm a stay at home worker! The real reason seems to clear out older employees. Anything I can do?

Original Post: 

> My company was bought out about four years ago by another company.  Old company had stock options, 401k, ect, and really seemed to value their employees. Now the new owners are bragging about shutting down sites and outsourcing constantly in the town halls. 
> 
> I'm the oldest team member and have trained everyone on my team at one point. They hired a ""floater"" to be able to handle when we go on vacations, ect. During the start of the virus, I asked directly in a team meeting if we need to be worried about our jobs, and was told no... many times.
> 
> Then on March 30th, I was pulled into a call with HR and told I was part of a mass layoff. They claim it was due to the coronavirus, but they refused to say they would hire me back when the pandemic was over like most other companies would tell you. 
> 
> Instead, I got this 3-week severance package and all over it talks about the separation of older workers act, and now that I'm 41, an attached document gave a list of all the employees let go, and they all were in their late 30's to high 50's with a sprinkling of a 22 or 23-year-old call centre worker.
> 
> I'm sure there's nothing I can do about it. It feels like the CEO jumped on the Coronavirus to clean house of all the employees who were grandfathered into their pay scales and benefits. Right now, it seems like the company who hired me is completely dead now. Not a single person from the old group is left. 
> 
> It was like someone came in and gutted everything, and is wearing my old company like a skin suit, keeping the brand we worked so hard to maintain while shitting all the people who put in the hard work and effort to make that company what it was out the back, like a zombie parasite.

> 
>  
> 
>  Hsieh llevó dos informes a la reunión con la funcionaria del Ministerio de Salud y le detalló cada uno de estos documentos, pero nunca tuvo respuesta. Tampoco lo contactó la Cancillería o alguna otra dependencia del gobierno argentino para analizar la documentación entregada.

> 
>  
> 
>  El encuentro del diplomático de Taiwán con la epidemióloga del Ministerio de Salud fue una reunión privada y extraoficial por un simple motivo: la Argentina no reconoce a Taiwán como Estado independiente sino que solo habla de “una solo China”. Se trata de un estatus diplomático histórico de la Argentina que trascendió todos los gobiernos y que no acepta la autonomía de Taiwán.
> 
>  
> 
>  Además, la OMS tampoco reconoció hasta ahora a Taiwán como miembro de ese organismo por las mismas razones diplomáticas que tienen la Argentina y muchos países del mundo sobre el estatus diplomático de los taiwaneses.
> 
>  
> 
>  **Hsieh no quiso revelar el nombre de la funcionaria de Salud con quien se reunió en febrero porque mantener el anonimato de esa funcionaria fue una de las condiciones que hubo para llevar adelante aquel encuentro.** Es que el recelo de China es muy fuerte al momento de que Argentina o cualquier otro país quiera entablar diálogo con Taipei. De hecho, nuestro país, como la mayoría, tiene una oficina comercial y no una embajada en Taiwán.

>  1- El 20 de enero Taiwán comenzó a exigir a todos los hospitales que realizaran las pruebas correspondientes y reportaran los casos. “Eso ayudó al gobierno a identificar a los infectados, rastrear a sus contactos y aislar a todos los involucrados, evitando que el virus se propague en la comunidad”, decía el documento.

> 
>  
> 
>  4-El gobierno taiwanés integró datos del seguro nacional de salud con datos de inmigración y aduanas, y desarrolló un programa que permitió a las personas reportar historias de viaje y síntomas de enfermedad escaneando un código QR cuando llegaran a Taiwán. Luego, los viajeros reciben un mensaje de texto con su estado de salud, lo que permite a los funcionarios de aduanas omitir pasajeros de bajo riesgo y centrarse en los pasajeros con un alto riesgo de infección por COVID-19.
> 
>  
> 
>  5- Para un eficaz suministro de elementos de protección, se prohibió la exportación de barbijos, implementó un sistema de racionamiento y fijó el precio en solo 16 centavos cada uno de estos protectores.
> 
>  
> 
>  6- Hubo una fuerte campaña de educación a la población con mensajes frecuentes de las autoridades sanitarias en la radio y la televisión.
> 
>  
> 
>  7- Taiwán aprobó un nuevo sistema de racionamiento de mascarillas quirúrgicas. Y ya desde el 6 de febrero se les denegó la entrada a todos los ciudadanos chinos.

 ""Belgium is considering changing the way it calculates coronavirus deaths. Federal health minister Maggie De Block said on Thursday: ""No other country in Europe counts in the same way as us.

LOCK STEP – A world of tighter top-down government control and more authoritarian leadership, with limited innovation and growing citizen pushback

In 2012, the pandemic that the world had been anticipating for years finally hit. Unlike 2009’s H1N1, this new influenza strain — originating from wild geese — was extremely virulent and deadly. Even the most pandemic-prepared nations were quickly overwhelmed when the virus streaked around the world, infecting nearly 20 percent of the global population and killing 8 million in just seven months, the majority of them healthy young adults. The pandemic also had a deadly effect on economies: international mobility of both people and goods screeched to a halt, debilitating industries like tourism and breaking global supply chains. Even locally, normally bustling shops and office buildings sat empty for months, devoid of both employees and customers.The full document at http://www.nommeraadio.ee/meedia/pdf/RRS/Rockefeller%20Foundation.pdf  


Event 201 is a pandemic tabletop exercise hosted by The Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security in partnership with the World Economic Forum and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation on October 18, 2019, in New York, NY. The exercise illustrated the pandemic preparedness efforts needed to diminish the large-scale economic and societal consequences of a severe pandemic. Guess what virus they happen to choose for their ‘simulation’? A coronavirus! Guess what animal cells they use? Pig cells! Drawing from actual events, Event 201 identifies important policy issues and preparedness challenges that could be solved with sufficient political will and attention. These issues were designed in a narrative to engage and educate the participants and the audience.

In 2014, the world avoided a global outbreak of Ebola, thanks to thousands of selfless health workers -- plus, frankly, some very good luck. In hindsight, we know what we should have done better. So, now's the time, Bill Gates suggests, to put all our good ideas into practice, from scenario planning to vaccine research to health worker training. As he says, ""There's no need to panic ... but we need to get going.""

This is a list of all the countries that have the highest deaths rates, from the Corona Virus. Coincidentally, it just so happens to be the same countries that rolled out the infamous 5G in 2020

Italy - If it meets its goals, Italy will be ahead of the European Commission’s (EC) targets. The EC’s 5G plan states commercial, large scale introduction of the technology should take place by the end of 2020.

United States - The Federal Communications Commission’s (FCC) Spectrum Frontiers Order has laid the groundwork for the use of 5G technology in the United States by 2020.

Spain - Telefónica, Spain’s largest mobile carrier, announced today that it will begin the 5G rollout process this year by transforming two Spanish cities into “5G living laboratories.” Under the 5G Technological Cities Project, Nokia and Ericsson will work with Telefónica from 2018 through 2020 to develop initial 5G capacity, deployments, and use cases to benefit both citizens and companies.

France - rench telecom regulator Arcep expects the commercial roll-out of the next-generation 5G mobile phone network in the country to commence in 2020, to be followed by large-scale commercialisation a decade later.

United Kingdom - At least here in the UK, 2019 was the year 5G finally took off, with most of the major network providers switching on their next generation networks.

Labelling 2020 “the year of 5G,” Qualcomm president Cristiano Amon believes that 5G will go mainstream in the next decade as the network becomes even more accessible for enterprise and consumer customers alike.

Iran - ""The global predictions show that Iran’s 5G will roll out in 2020 and hit the mainstreams by 2022.

China - In November, all three launched commercial 5G networks, marking an accelerated deployment from China's original plans to launch in 2020. China Mobile, the country's largest network, is now live in 50 cities, with the other two networks planning to reach as many cities by the end of 2019.

Germany - According to the 5G Strategy for Germany, released by Germany's Federal Ministry of Transport and Digital Infrastructure (BMVI), trial installations began in 2018 with a commercial launch in 2020. 5G is planned to be rolled out ""over the period to 2025.""

Belgium – The Belgium carrier has been targeting a commercial 5G launch for 2020.

Netherlands - The goal is to make The Hague the first city in the Netherlands with a full 5G coverage network in 2020, after the auction of 700MHz frequencies scheduled for completion early 2020.

Brazil - Next year's 5G spectrum auction in Brazil could be the biggest yet, according to a senior Nokia executive. Brazil plans to auction spectrum in the 700MHz, 2.3GHz, 3.5GHz and 26GHz bands in the first quarter of 2020, the regulator told Brazil's parliament earlier this year.

Switzerland - In a press release external link earlier this month, Swisscom said that it anticipates 5G coverage ""throughout the Swiss territory"" in 2020

It's a mad tale. Stay with me. Me with my superb @ft colleague @Michael_Pooler 1/Thread

> So it starts around March 13 as the #coronavirus storm clouds are gathering in Italy. Panic is on in UK to DO SOMETHING and, worse, UK doesn't have much advanced manufacturing capacity. Government is under pressure. What to do? /2

>Well, start on March 14 by summoning the 'Blitz spirit' which @MattHancock does on March 14 in @telegraph article here, urging UK manufacturers to pivot production lines to make ventilators. ""We cannot make too many."" And lots of wartime blah. /3 

>But the question soon arises - WHAT should those manufacturers build? Do we build from scratch? 'Reinvent the wheel' so to speak? Or tool up/expand what existing capacity we have? Or seek to make stuff under licence? This is the BIG question..../4

>And the answer comes on March 16 when @BorisJohnson does a conference call with all of the top industrial bosses. They want something simple, non-ICU that can be mass produced - as an insider on the call tells us:/5 

> In fact, it is SO simple that the draft 'indicative' specification circulating at the time carried a YouTube video tutorial for a Manley Blease ventilator designed in 1961 that, as the narrator says, has been 'consigned to the history books' /6

>Now hindsight is a beautiful thing. The government says it was 'looking at all options' - a simple ventilator is better than NO ventilator. 

>But to be clear even at the time people who understood both ventilators AND manufacturing were raising serious misgivings. /7

>Look at this @BBCNews report from March 16 - the day of the @BorisJohnson call. 

>MakeUK boss @Makeuk_Sphipson told Today we'd be better making existing stuff under  license.

>@PenlonGlobal head of products says it is ""unrealistic"" to make from scratch/8

>But still, that's what the govt chooses to do - starting what one insider dismissively described to me as a 'hackathon' to reinvent the complex wheel that is a medical ventilator. 

>The boss of GTech, a Worcester garden appliance thought it was 'hoax'. /9

>But when the regulator publishes the first formal 'spec' for the new ventilators it is need super-simple. 

>The 'intended purpose' is that these vents should work for a 'few hours' and 'in extremis' 24 /10 

>The basic ventilator spec also does not contain really important features including “spontaneous breathing modes” — the ability of ventilators to synchronise with a patient’s breathing as a key part of “weaning” patients off respiratory support. /11

>Now. The government insists that this was all done with the advice of both top doctors AND the regulators. That's what it says. /12

>But is that true? When I showed that spec to @AlisonPittard last week, she was amazed. Yes docs were prepared to have less-than Rolls-Royce features, they could live with a Ford, not a Ferrari. But this is a spec, basically, for a Trabant /13

>What about the Regulators - the MHRA - they what did they think? As we report, insiders, say that quite quickly there was push-back about the utility of these basic vents, the damage they would cause, and their utility in weaning  patients back to health. /14 

>Initially when those concerns were pushed up the chain, the reply came back ""that's what the customer wants"".

>Which begs a question. WHO was the customer?

>Not the docs. Not the regulator. Not the patients. 

>The only answer that fits, is the Government. The politicians. EESH/15

>It takes time for the penny to drop in Whitehall and the Cabinet Office - but by April 10, check out the 'amended' spec that says “the greater proportion of devices” for treating coronavirus would need to be capable of supporting “spontaneous breathing modes”/16

>The result is that the Bluesky consortium - which HAD BUILT to spec is canned on April 11. And others like the 'Oxvent' scheme (another low-spec effort) is paused. Insiders tell us that quite possibly none of these 'hackathon' designs will get approval /17

>Why does this matter? The government did change tack in the face of medical and scientific pressure and (mercifully) it was spared its blushes because ventilator capacity held up, clinicians used more (non-invasive) CPAP and (probably) more deaths happened in community. /18

>So no harm done? No. Not really.

>What this speaks to is the deeply worrying tendency of this crop of politicians to think they know best.

>The 'cut-the-crap' 'how-hard-can-it-be?' attitudes that leads to headless decision making. It's embarrassing. /19

>Over the last week I've had SO many conversations with docs and experts that remind of the conversations I had with logisticians, port operators, customs clearers over #Brexit. 

>Expert people TEARING their hair out at the willful numbskullery of the people at the top. /20

>As a side note, this kind of treatment PISSSES PEOPLE OFF. 

>My inbox is full of people who daren't speak on record but are SEETHING at the way they were treated.

>People who worked 20-hour days for weeks; gave freely of their time, energy and spirit for nothing. /21

>The government may look to try and find an outlet for these ventilators in other places - but you have to ask, if they're not fit for UK patients (and we'll see if any can get clearance) why would they work for poorer countries? I'll be watching. /22

>Because guess, a device that keeps you alive, that breathes for you IS flipping complicated. How hard can it be? Damn hard.

>It's parts mustn't catch fire in a high-oxygen environment.

>It's software must anticipate a patients breathing. If it freezes, you may die. /23

> This was OBVIOUS AT THE OUTSET.

>The government said 'the clinical understanding of the disease changed' but that is a RED HERRING.

>It did, but the science was NEVER in a place where it wanted 'bag-in-a-box' ventilators. /24

> What worries me is if this 'how hard can it be?' principle is applied to testing, to PPE procurement etc.

>The government needs to show some HUMILITY. It needs to LISTEN TO PEOPLE WHO KNOW STUFF. I think this is a clear example of where it did not. ENDS

>Good weekend all.

###Tips For Social Distancing, Quarantine, And Isolation During An Infectious Disease Outbreak

**What Is Social Distancing?**

Social distancing is a way to keep people from interacting closely or frequently enough to spread an infectious disease. Schools and other gathering places such as movie theaters may close, and sports events and religious services may be cancelled.

**What Is Quarantine?**

Quarantine separates and restricts the movement of people who have been exposed to a contagious disease to see if they become sick. It lasts long enough to ensure the person has not contracted an infectious disease.

**What Is Isolation?**

Isolation prevents the spread of an infectious disease by separating people who are sick from those who are not. It lasts as long as the disease is contagious.

##What To Expect: Typical Reactions

Everyone reacts differently to stressful situations such as an infectious disease outbreak that requires social distancing, quarantine, or isolation. People may feel:

- **Anxiety, worry, or fear related to**:  
- Your own health status  
- The health status of others whom you may have exposed to the disease  
- The resentment that your friends and family may feel if they need to go into quarantine as a result of contact with you  
- The experience of monitoring yourself, or being monitored by others for signs and symptoms of the disease  
- Time taken off from work and the potential loss of income and job security  
- The challenges of securing things you need, such as groceries and personal care items  
- **Concern** about being able to effectively care for children or others in your care  
- **Uncertainty or frustration** about how long you will need to remain in this situation, and uncertainty about the future  
- **Loneliness** associated with feeling cut off from the world and from loved ones  
- **Anger** if you think you were exposed to the disease because of others’ negligence  
- **Boredom and frustration** because you may not be able to work or engage in regular day-to-day activities  
- **Uncertainty or ambivalence** about the situation  
- **A desire** to use alcohol or drugs to cope  
- **Symptoms of depression**, such as feelings of hopelessness, changes in appetite, or sleeping too little or too much  
- **Symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD)**, such as intrusive distressing memories, flashbacks (reliving the event), nightmares, changes in thoughts and mood, and being easily startled.

##Ways To Support Yourself During Social Distancing, Quarantine, and Isolation

#UNDERSTAND THE RISK

Consider the real risk of harm to yourself and others around you. The public perception of risk during a situation such as an infectious disease outbreak is often inaccurate. Media coverage may create the impression that people are in immediate danger when really the risk for infection may be very low. Take steps to get the facts:

- Stay up to date on what is happening, while limiting your media exposure. Avoid watching or listening to news reports 24/7 since this tends to increase anxiety and worry. Remember that children are especially affected by what they hear and see on television.  
- Look to credible sources for information on the infectious disease outbreak.

#BE YOUR OWN ADVOCATE

Speaking out about your needs is particularly important if you are in quarantine, since you may not be in a hospital or other facility where your basic needs are met. Ensure you have what you need to feel safe, secure, and comfortable.

- Work with local, state, or national health officials to find out how you can arrange for groceries and toiletries to be delivered to your home as needed.  
- Inform health care providers or health authorities of any needed medications and work with them to ensure that you continue to receive those medications.

#EDUCATE YOURSELF

Health care providers and health authorities should provide information on the disease, its diagnosis, and treatment.

- Do not be afraid to ask questions—clear communication with a health care provider may help reduce any distress associated with social distancing, quarantine, or isolation.  
- Ask for written information when available.  
- Ask a family member or friend to obtain information in the event that you are unable to secure this information on your own.

#WORK WITH YOUR EMPLOYER TO REDUCE FINANCIAL STRESS

If you’re unable to work during this time, you may experience stress related to your job status or financial situation.

- Provide your employer with a clear explanation of why you are away from work.  
- Contact the U.S. Department of Labor tollfree at 1-866-487-2365 about the Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA), which allows U.S. employees up to 12 weeks of unpaid leave for serious medical conditions, or to care for a family member with a serious medical condition.  
- Contact your utility providers, cable and Internet provider, and other companies from whom you get monthly bills to explain your situation and request alternative bill payment arrangements as needed.

#CONNECT WITH OTHERS

Reaching out to people you trust is one of the best ways to reduce anxiety, depression, loneliness, and boredom during social distancing, quarantine, and isolation. You can:

- Use the telephone, email, text messaging, and social media to connect with friends, family, and others.  
- Talk “face to face” with friends and loved ones using Skype or FaceTime.  
- If approved by health authorities and your health care providers, arrange for your friends and loved ones to bring you newspapers, movies, and books.  
- Sign up for emergency alerts via text or email to ensure you get updates as soon as they are available.  
- Call SAMHSA’s free 24-hour Disaster Distress Helpline at 1-800-985-5990, if you feel lonely or need support.  
- Use the Internet, radio, and television to keep up with local, national, and world events.  
- If you need to connect with someone because of an ongoing alcohol or drug problem, consider calling your local Alcoholics Anonymous or Narcotics Anonymous offices.

#TALK TO YOUR DOCTOR

If you are in a medical facility, you may have access to health care providers who can answer your questions. However, if you are quarantined at home, and you’re worried about physical symptoms you or your loved ones may be experiencing, call your doctor or other health care provider:

- Ask your provider whether it would be possible to schedule remote appointments via Skype or FaceTime for mental health, substance use, or physical health needs.

#USE PRACTICAL WAYS TO COPE AND RELAX

- Relax your body often by doing things that work for you-take deep breaths, stretch, meditate or pray, or engage in activities you enjoy.  
- Pace yourself between stressful activities, and do something fun after a hard task.  
- Talk about your experiences and feelings to loved ones and friends, if you find it helpful.  
- Maintain a sense of hope and positive thinking; consider keeping a journal where you write down things you are grateful for or that are going well

2020-04-18,unicorn_defender,WeAreTheMusicMakers,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/WeAreTheMusicMakers/comments/g296gw/yall_ever_lay_down_to_sleep_and_boom_a_fully/fnsak22/,"Sorry for the delay. Coronavirus news at work had me and my coworkers shaken up for a bit. Also, this post ended up **WAY** longer than I planned because I can't help but be thorough even when it comes to simple shit, and I also really padded up the ""BE SAFE DRUGS CAN BE BAD"" stuff despite how ""non-dangerous"" these drugs technically are (unless they're taken way over their recommended doses).

I'll do a run down of what I've experimented with personally, but just know that your mileage may vary. So, here is what  I call my DMC stack.

The Stack : 

\- *Diphenhydramine* (25-50mg) 

\- *Melatonin* (2mg) (possibly optional)

\- *Caffeine* (100-200mg)

**NOTE:** Diphenhydramine is an antihistamine that is the main ingredient in Benadryl. Tylenol PM, and Nyquil and is the drug that is responsible for the drowsy onset you get when taking said medications. If you've ever bought sleeping pills such as NyquilZZZ or just a generic store brand, this is what you were taking. 

\[Please see my note about being cautious with this drug. **TLDR: DO NOT TAKE MORE THAN 200-300mg in a single day!**

I also want to quickly point out that there seem to be no known negative interactions that occur when taking these drugs together; that is to say my own research on the internet hasn't yielded any results.

&#x200B;

**The Timing**

Each of these drugs has a slightly different release time into the body and so I spread the dosages out. First, I take the Diphenhydramine and wait approximately 25-30 minutes. Then I'll take the 2mg of Melatonin. After that I will wait another 25-30 minutes before taking the Caffeine (200mg pill in my case, though you can take less if you are personally averse to caffeine or it makes you jittery). Ideally you want to take the Caffeine as you begin to feel the drowsiness set in from the Diphenhydramine.

&#x200B;

**What does this do?**

Again, this is all from my own personal experience. I won't claim that this is going to work as well for you as it does for me.

What I found was that the effects of the Diphenhydramine increased my auditory responsiveness, making me ""more aware"" of music and sound. I would notice that when the drowsiness set in, listening to music became a bit more enjoyable. 

This is what originally lead me to the idea of trying to make music while under the effects. However, I quickly found that it was harder to focus and perform the visual tasks of operating my DAW despite the fact that I was ""more in tune"" with the music.

This is when I added the Caffeine to the mix. By taking the Caffeine I found that my alertness and mindfulness was increased, allowing my me to focus more on what I was actually doing, while still lingering in the ""drowsiness high"" of the diphenhydramine.

I added the melatonin purely to experiment and found that it seemed to relax my body a bit more and reduce stress, however I don't think it is essential to the overall experience; but, considering it's a natural compound released in the brain, there doesn't seem to be much harm in taking it to see if you notice the differences.

I still experiment with this stack maybe once every week or two when I know I need to work on music but I can't work up the energy or I'm not feeling creative. I still find that it helps me hear interesting solutions in my music and allows me to take things in a direction I may not have gone in otherwise.

**Being cautious...**

Keep in mind that operating a vehicle while under the effects of Diphenhydramine is a big no-no and because this stack is going to make you feel a little light headed and drowsy, it's best that you only take this stack in the afternoon or when you know you won't be going out to run errands or have important responsibilities to take care of. 

Yeah, yeah I know. I'm not your daddy, but I don't know who all will end up reading this, so I want to make it very clear that despite this stack ultimately being harmless, it's still best to practice mindfulness and cautiousness. 

**Do your own research and BE SAFE!**

A follow up note on Diphenhydramine; **I would highly advise against taking more than 200mg of Diphenhydramine in a single day.** Other than extreme drowsiness and some grogginess the following day, you shouldn't experience any notable side effects; however, prolonged use of Diphenhydramine can lead to a light dependence, and because the drug has a short half life and a decent tolerance build up, you may find yourself taking upwards of 300-400mg a day, and once you get to that point you are dangerously close to some nasty hallucinations and a very bad drug trip; like the not-so-fun, nightmare world, kill me now kind of trip.

Take my word, you don't want it to go there, and you can read online about people who were taking upwards of 800mg of the stuff in order to try and trip and having nothing but a bad experience filled with dread and depression. If you find yourself taking close to 200-300mg a day BE SAFE AND STOP TAKING THE SHIT!

There are people actually spreading information sources from reputable sources, with actual experience with this specific kind of crisis.

You trying to paint it like its misinformation, is what actually is that.

Are you going to say that the guide of DIY printed resources on my page for hobbyists to use to help is also misinformation?

I'm not talking about this stuff like I'm removed- I'm talking about this because it IS that serious. Like how I need to facillate resources to local arab communities here in the Negev because perhaps jewish government isn't lending enough.

So don't tell me its not serious when really theres a huge LACK of adequate information.

Read what I just sent you above, and tell me again how you think anything I've written is overblown. 18 months for a vaccine. That is the earliest you could conceivably plan on this resolving.

I think you’ll be okay because you’re at the point where weed just isn’t satisfying. It’s masking and delaying pain.

I think the most important thing is to pick up new stress coping mechanisms. Honestly these times are insane with coronavirus. If you can maintain healthy coping mechanisms during this time, you can do it all the time. Some habits I’ve developed are meditation, exercise, music, writing, and cooking. These combined all help give me emotional outlets to process and express feelings. 

When new stress hits, your body will want to do what it’s always done. Just know that’s merely momentum and not YOU. it’s like inertia. An object that smokes will continue to smoke. An object at rest stays at rest. Right now is the biggest change because you’re changing your habit inertia. But soon it becomes regular and then bam you’re a new you. 

I’m on day 38 and what helped me was realizing just exactly how weed gets in the way of my goals. I want to feel hot and confident in my body. And weed negativity affects sleep, diet, and exercise. All 3 are the trifecta to feeling good physically. So that bowl just isn’t worth delaying progress any longer.

The plan outlines how U.S. state governors could act to revive the U.S. economy from its coronavirus shutdown in a staggered, three-stage process.
Speaking at his daily briefing on the coronavirus, which has killed more than 32,600 Americans in a matter of weeks, Trump argued that a prolonged shutdown could be deeply harmful to the U.S. economy and society.
The new federal guidelines recommend that states record a 14-day ""downward trajectory"" in coronavirus cases before beginning a three-phase process of re-opening.
The document lays out Trump's plan for opening businesses in states across the country that have been ravaged by the pandemic and its economic impact even though the responsibility for such decisions lies with state, not federal, authorities.
Trump also warned that the U.S. could see a ""flare up"" of coronavirus cases in the fall but said the country would be better prepared for a second outbreak.
""We're going to be in a great position with everything we've done and everything we've learned,"" he said."

I bring up concrete examples from sources that can be referenced and debunked or questioned for reliability.  They don't care.  They ignore them.  They claim the source is bad, no matter how many sources you provide. 

I am perfectly willing to debate but when their only argument is, ""The data is wrong,"" with no supporting counter data, just anecdotal evidence they heard, they aren't worth the time to debate.  Once one throws out the word ""sheeple"" I'm done talking with them because they will never rely on rational argument.

I'm not going to waste my time engaging someone who simply ignores data they don't like by claiming the source is tainted through some deep dark conspiracy. If they bring up a point that I question, I'll go research it to make sure I understand. 

A perfect example:

>5G is non-ionizing radiation.  Non-ionizing radiation doesn't cause mutations yet I have seen them push the claim that 5G radiation has caused a dangerous mutation in the standard coronavirus.

Everything in that above statement (except the conspiracy theorist claim) is based on objective, scientific fact and can be proven true, or proven false, through many sources that use actual science, not feelings.

The very fact people believe the Finland Conspiracy is real is solid evidence that you can't hold rational conversations with people once they latch on to a conspiracy as true."

(Of course, to be fair, Hong Kong employed all four key pillars in containing covid-19 and #Masks4All is only one of the four -- the other three are aggressive testing, contact tracing, and quanrantine of people who are in close contact with the infected.  The UK seems to have lost it will to do any one of them. Sad! )

###Tips For Social Distancing, Quarantine, And Isolation During An Infectious Disease Outbreak

**What Is Social Distancing?**

Social distancing is a way to keep people from interacting closely or frequently enough to spread an infectious disease. Schools and other gathering places such as movie theaters may close, and sports events and religious services may be cancelled.

**What Is Quarantine?**

Quarantine separates and restricts the movement of people who have been exposed to a contagious disease to see if they become sick. It lasts long enough to ensure the person has not contracted an infectious disease.

**What Is Isolation?**

Isolation prevents the spread of an infectious disease by separating people who are sick from those who are not. It lasts as long as the disease is contagious.

##What To Expect: Typical Reactions

Everyone reacts differently to stressful situations such as an infectious disease outbreak that requires social distancing, quarantine, or isolation. People may feel:

- **Anxiety, worry, or fear related to**:  
- Your own health status  
- The health status of others whom you may have exposed to the disease  
- The resentment that your friends and family may feel if they need to go into quarantine as a result of contact with you  
- The experience of monitoring yourself, or being monitored by others for signs and symptoms of the disease  
- Time taken off from work and the potential loss of income and job security  
- The challenges of securing things you need, such as groceries and personal care items  
- **Concern** about being able to effectively care for children or others in your care  
- **Uncertainty or frustration** about how long you will need to remain in this situation, and uncertainty about the future  
- **Loneliness** associated with feeling cut off from the world and from loved ones  
- **Anger** if you think you were exposed to the disease because of others’ negligence  
- **Boredom and frustration** because you may not be able to work or engage in regular day-to-day activities  
- **Uncertainty or ambivalence** about the situation  
- **A desire** to use alcohol or drugs to cope  
- **Symptoms of depression**, such as feelings of hopelessness, changes in appetite, or sleeping too little or too much  
- **Symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD)**, such as intrusive distressing memories, flashbacks (reliving the event), nightmares, changes in thoughts and mood, and being easily startled.

##Ways To Support Yourself During Social Distancing, Quarantine, and Isolation

#UNDERSTAND THE RISK

Consider the real risk of harm to yourself and others around you. The public perception of risk during a situation such as an infectious disease outbreak is often inaccurate. Media coverage may create the impression that people are in immediate danger when really the risk for infection may be very low. Take steps to get the facts:

- Stay up to date on what is happening, while limiting your media exposure. Avoid watching or listening to news reports 24/7 since this tends to increase anxiety and worry. Remember that children are especially affected by what they hear and see on television.  
- Look to credible sources for information on the infectious disease outbreak.

#BE YOUR OWN ADVOCATE

Speaking out about your needs is particularly important if you are in quarantine, since you may not be in a hospital or other facility where your basic needs are met. Ensure you have what you need to feel safe, secure, and comfortable.

- Work with local, state, or national health officials to find out how you can arrange for groceries and toiletries to be delivered to your home as needed.  
- Inform health care providers or health authorities of any needed medications and work with them to ensure that you continue to receive those medications.

#EDUCATE YOURSELF

Health care providers and health authorities should provide information on the disease, its diagnosis, and treatment.

- Do not be afraid to ask questions—clear communication with a health care provider may help reduce any distress associated with social distancing, quarantine, or isolation.  
- Ask for written information when available.  
- Ask a family member or friend to obtain information in the event that you are unable to secure this information on your own.

#WORK WITH YOUR EMPLOYER TO REDUCE FINANCIAL STRESS

If you’re unable to work during this time, you may experience stress related to your job status or financial situation.

- Provide your employer with a clear explanation of why you are away from work.  
- Contact the U.S. Department of Labor tollfree at 1-866-487-2365 about the Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA), which allows U.S. employees up to 12 weeks of unpaid leave for serious medical conditions, or to care for a family member with a serious medical condition.  
- Contact your utility providers, cable and Internet provider, and other companies from whom you get monthly bills to explain your situation and request alternative bill payment arrangements as needed.

#CONNECT WITH OTHERS

Reaching out to people you trust is one of the best ways to reduce anxiety, depression, loneliness, and boredom during social distancing, quarantine, and isolation. You can:

- Use the telephone, email, text messaging, and social media to connect with friends, family, and others.  
- Talk “face to face” with friends and loved ones using Skype or FaceTime.  
- If approved by health authorities and your health care providers, arrange for your friends and loved ones to bring you newspapers, movies, and books.  
- Sign up for emergency alerts via text or email to ensure you get updates as soon as they are available.  
- Call SAMHSA’s free 24-hour Disaster Distress Helpline at 1-800-985-5990, if you feel lonely or need support.  
- Use the Internet, radio, and television to keep up with local, national, and world events.  
- If you need to connect with someone because of an ongoing alcohol or drug problem, consider calling your local Alcoholics Anonymous or Narcotics Anonymous offices.

#TALK TO YOUR DOCTOR

If you are in a medical facility, you may have access to health care providers who can answer your questions. However, if you are quarantined at home, and you’re worried about physical symptoms you or your loved ones may be experiencing, call your doctor or other health care provider:

- Ask your provider whether it would be possible to schedule remote appointments via Skype or FaceTime for mental health, substance use, or physical health needs.

#USE PRACTICAL WAYS TO COPE AND RELAX

- Relax your body often by doing things that work for you-take deep breaths, stretch, meditate or pray, or engage in activities you enjoy.  
- Pace yourself between stressful activities, and do something fun after a hard task.  
- Talk about your experiences and feelings to loved ones and friends, if you find it helpful.  
- Maintain a sense of hope and positive thinking; consider keeping a journal where you write down things you are grateful for or that are going well
