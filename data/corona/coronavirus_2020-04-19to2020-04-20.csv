At this point he's seen just about all there is it see, and has become known for his prescient analysis of economic cycles.

""It's a different thing when you've lived through these cycles as opposed to reading about them,"" he said on ""The Contrarian Investor Podcast."" ""I have a lot of conviction on my calls, typically, because I have that experience behind me.""

Today, Hunter thinks the economy is nearing the end of a ""super-cycle"" — the collapse of which will have cataclysmic repercussions.

""We're at the latter-end of a super-cycle,"" he said. ""The super-cycle is the long cycle that starts after the last depression and ends with the next depression.""

Hunter's gloomy forecast is mainly predicated upon what he sees as an unmanageable amount of debt and leverage that's been building within the economy.

If that evaluation and skepticism of the overarching landscape sounds familiar, it's because Ray Dalio, the billionaire founder and cochief investment officer of Bridgewater Associates, touts a similar thesis. He's also been equating today's longer-term debt cycle to the Great Depression era.

Dalio has long warned of the unsustainability of a low-interest-rate environment — especially one where asset prices have become overextended. A widening wealth gap and a surging populist movement also inform his view that today's situation mirrors the 1930s.

Hunter is similarly weary of unprecedented central bank easing.

""We have debt beyond anything we can ever manage,"" Hunter said. ""When you get these surprises, that leverage really exacerbates whatever downturn you get.""

Now, with two of the world's largest economies — the US and China — essentially running at a fraction of their prior capacity, Hunter thinks the bust is inevitable.

""You look at where we are today, and you can become pretty dire about coming out of this,"" he said. ""I think this is the front edge of that bust.""


Hunter thinks this will all play out with an intense bout of volatility. And his view of what happens next might be surprising considering his dire long-term outlook.

Hunter actually sees a massive S&P 500 rally transpiring before an eventual collapse. In fact, he thinks the benchmark will exceed 4,000 by Labor Day — implying upside of about 40% from current levels. He refers to this as the final ""melt up"" and says it will be ""a secular top that I expect to be the high-water mark for decades to come.""

His reasoning behind his bullish short-term call is simple: unprecedented Federal Reserve stimulus.

""Because you're getting money beyond anything that's ever been pumped before, you can get this run up in the market in spite of the fact that the bust is not going to leave us,"" Hunter said. ""We're not going to start the bust and then not.""

He continued: ""We will have some sort of a 'V' recovery for a quarter, maybe two, because of all this money — but ultimately, it's all one bust.""

A similar degree of medium-term bullish sentiment has been adopted by equity strategists at Goldman Sachs. They recently called the S&P 500 market bottom on the heels of a $2.3 trillion Fed stimulus announcement. It's become a popular sentiment across Wall Street that the Fed's actions have bailed out financial markets and enabled risk-takers.

Unfortunately, Hunter thinks the market's stimulus-induced exuberance will be exhausted in the later portion of the year as participants realize the money printer isn't the panacea that had hoped it'd be.

""There's a lot of things you can't reach with money, and a lot of things you can't fix,"" he said. ""We're also dealing with a virus that is beyond anything we're used to dealing with — and it's going to take time to get that fixed.""

That element of his forecast matches that of fellow market bears, including Societe Generale strategist Albert Edwards and John Hussman, the former economics professor and current president of the Hussman Investment Trust.

Both have cited unprecedented levels of Fed stimulus as creating unsustainable asset bubbles that will eventually pop. They say easy lending conditions have backstopped assets and allowed for wild speculation — and believe that's created unsustainable pockets of risk throughout markets.

With all of that under examination, Hunter delivers a stark warning.

""What follows the final leg up is what I call: 'A bear market of historic proportions,'"" he said. ""From that high this summer, I expect an 80% peak-to-trough decline.""  

""Basically the biggest bear market since the '29 crash,"" he concluded.

But even Chinese doctors didn't know about them. The virus won't be sequenced until January. The US cannot possibly know before Chinese doctors do, unless the CCP is right that the US brought the coronavirus over there. But then, it would be incredibly odd the US doesn't have a vaccine, and the US government only warned Israel and NATO but did nothing to prepare for a pandemic. I call this story B.S.

So I figured I'd write up an update. Here's my previous write up.

  


[https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/ffqiyn/daily_discussion_post_march_09_questions_images/fk0238h?context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/ffqiyn/daily_discussion_post_march_09_questions_images/fk0238h?context=3)

  


Korea's coming off a day with 8 new cases. 8 in the whole country. Such a low number is great, but at the same time, it has this ""too good to be true"" kind of a feel. Like something terrible is just around the corner, ready to hit us with another patient \#31. I guess the last few months has brought out the skeptic in me.

  


Today's the first day of school for my oldest kid, 2nd grade. It's an online first day of school, but first day of school nonetheless. It's going to count as a day in school for the academic year, as I understand it. Some older kids, especially those in their last year of middle/high school started a couple of weeks earlier. As expected, there were some problems of EBS (Education broadcasting Station) website being down for a few days, but mostly I think it's been going OK. People know everything's not going to be perfect, but this seems fine. My kid will be watching 2 30 minute episodes of ""class"" on TV, one at 9:30, the second at 10:30, and submit some form of a response to his homeroom teacher by 2 pm via commenting on an app. My biggest concern is the younger one contantly getting in the way, but we'll see how it goes.

  


Bigger news has been politics. I don't want to get TOO political, but I feel I should mention how the virus affected the result. Contrary to my concerns, the voting turnout was higher than any other elections in the past (limited to lawmaker election. presidential elections have been higher). More than 60% showed up. In Korea, you have two days of pre-vote (not sure of the terminology) a few days before the official election day that includes a Saturday for people that can't make it to the voting booth on the official election day. This is useful especially if you're currently living away from your registered residence, because you can vote anywhere. On election day, you must goto your designated voting booth closest to your registered residence. I actually went Saturday to pre-vote, but I came back after seeing the long queue. It would've taken 30 minutes plus, at least. I went to vote at 6 am on official voting day, the time the booths open, and I still had to wait 20 minutes or so. The people stood about 1~2 meters apart, everyone obviously had there masks on. People working there gave out pumps of hand sanitizers, and then plastic gloves to wear. Temperatures were checked before entering the booth. Everything went well considering the situation. Left leaning ruling party had its biggest win in recent history, which was contrary to my concern that younger voter turnout would be low because of the virus. In all, I think we set a good precedent on how a nationawide election can be held through the virus.

  


Government stimulus has come in various ways. There are three separate programs that I was able to sign up to get money. First there's the providence/city stimulus. We get $200 (doing a rough 1USD=1,000KRW here) for every member of your family ($100 from the providence, $100 from the city). This means we got a $800 worth of local currency. I say ""local"" because this $800 can only be used within the local city, and for shops or business that has sales less than a specific amount. This eliminates Walmart-like businesses and department stores. They're trying to get you to spend the money of local small businesses. This $800 will disappear after 3 months. So we've been buying groceries and going to the dentist with this money. Second, there's $400 for every kids younger than 7. That money can be spent in the whole providence, not just the city. I can use it anywhere that's not Walmart-like business, dept stores, bars, etc. Then finally third, we have $100 for all elementary/middle/high school kids. This comes directly to my bank account and has no limits on usage. All this obviously helps. Of course us, but a lot of the local businesses. We've spent a lot of the money we got on books for kids, going to local bookstores. 

  


Other than that, not much has changed. I've gotten more used to living like this. I goto work like I did a month ago. All the masks, sanitizers, temperature checks are still there. If you have any questions, feel free to ask. Hope everyone's well."

China reported to public the first case in Dec 8th and isolated cases slowly showing up throughout December. It took China nearly one month to draw the dots into lines and find the similarity between these cases and declared it a novel coronavirus.

So what could one know by the end of November. I believe at best it was some kind of unknown pneumonia. There were hardly any signs of outbreak. There are wired unexplained diseases all the time and all the year around and most of them end up without any following up. Do they have evidence that an unknown pneumonia is going to cause a pandemic. Well I think it was too early to call and  too little convicing evidence. So I highly doubt the credibility of the news."

Either COVID is much more lethal than a typical flu or it's much more infectious. I don't have a strong opinion on which one and I don't care, because in either case the solution is the same: a temporary mass quarantine in order give the health care system time to gear up and prevent them from becoming overwhelmed.

Unfortunately, America has mishandled mass quarantine badly: at the national level, the state level, and very much at the personal level. In many states, you'll get your wish. The quarantines are so weak and so poorly obeyed that they might as well not exist, and the states are already planning to formally reopen their economies."

The rest of the whois information is obscured by a proxy organization that provides privacy for whois records (I even use them myself as do many others for privacy reasons), so I cannot tell *who* owns these domains. 

Following the pattern of their sites, I checked for ""reopenmd.com"", but it never resolved to anything. That said, the DNS lookup itself didn't result in a `NXDOMAIN` error which tells me the domain does exist.

Registered a little more than week later with the same registrar. The thing is, they didn't actually complete their whois information this time, and whoever set it up cheaped out or forgot to pay for the Domains by Proxy service. Although whois information is literally a public record, I'm not inclined to place my account at risk by opening myself up to accusations of doxxing. That said, anyone who feels inclined to can go to https://whois.godaddy.com and search for `reopenmd.com`. I myself would be personally curious as to why someone in Florida is registering domains claiming to be gun rights organizations in other states.

Seriously, even without that information - who or whomever is responsible for this astroturfing couldn't make this more obvious if they tried. It honestly took me longer to type all of this up to present here than it did for me to find this all. Yet people have taken the bait hook-line-and-sinker.

Meanwhile, the President then starts tweeting [""LIBERATE MINNESOTA""](https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1251168994066944003), [""LIBERATE VIRGINIA...""](https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1251169987110330372), and [""LIBERATE MICHIGAN""](https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1251169217531056130); and one of the major forces behind the group in Michigan was a political group that [has direct ties to](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Greg_McNeilly&oldid=933829692) and has historically been heavily funded by the family of the Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos (though [said family denies direct involvement in last weeks protest](https://www.newsweek.com/residents-gridlock-michigan-streets-protest-governor-whitmers-coronavirus-lockdown-measures-1498112))?

In that regard, I'm not alleging some major conspiracy here, but l-o-fucking-l.

Basically most of the current antibody tests are mostly useful for confirming past infections (which is useful for things like epidemiological modeling and studies), but aren’t particularly good at determining immunity on an individual basis. IIRC one of the issues is that they can occasionally pick up signs of antibodies from common cold coronavirus strains, and not necessarily SARS-2.

Many scientists have reason to believe that immunity to SARS-2 will behave as it has for SARS-1 and other coronaviruses: perhaps a couple of years of immunity due to antibodies, and then if you *do* get reinfected later on, subsequent infections won’t be as severe (due to other mechanisms in your immune system)."

Hogan, a Republican, faced a protest within his own state, as demonstrators drove cars, waved flags and honked their horns through Maryland's capital Annapolis on Saturday. The protesters were calling for Hogan to reopen businesses and the economy, despite guidelines put forward by the Trump administration and a growing number of cases of the coronavirus nationwide.

""I don't think it's helpful to encourage demonstrations and encourage people to go against the president's own policy,"" the GOP governor said during an interview with CNN's State of the Union Sunday. ""For example, I mentioned earlier, the president's policy says you can't start to reopen under his plan until you have declining numbers for 14 days, which those [other] states [with protests] and my state do not have,"" he explained.

""So then to encourage people to go protest, the plan that you just made recommendations on on Thursday, it just doesn't make any sense,"" Hogan added. ""We're sending completely conflicting messages out to the governors and to the people, as if we should ignore federal policy and federal recommendations.""

The Republican governor asserted that he can understand the frustration expressed by demonstrators. He said that he and other governors wanted to work toward reopening as soon as is safely possible.

Trump on Friday encouraged right-wing protests against stringent social distancing measures, tweeting: ""LIBERATE MINNESOTA,"" ""LIBERATE MICHIGAN"" and then ""LIBERATE VIRGINIA."""

What made it worse was an unsustainable pension passed after Whitman, which was based on the tech bubble, and was always way way way too high

AND THEN, Dems had a super majority, almost fixed the issue, but didn't have enough votes and the teachers union went out and flipped the state from dark blue to light red.   


No one ever forgot that, and no party has tried to fix the issue since. 

Now I've been saying, for years, that pension holders are gonna fuck themselves and the state one day, and that day is fastly approaching.  


Murphy is literally begging the federal government for $$$ for the states, OUR money, BTW, as we pay out more to the federal government than any other state and we get the least back.   


But we're not going to get our money back, this country will take take take from us and never, ever give it back.   


So Murphy is going to have to lay off state workers.  And mark my words, the very next thing to go will be social services and pensions will be slashed, and then NJ Transit.  It's going to cripple the state

The ambulance found a downtown Tokyo hospital that could treat the patient after 80 other hospitals rejected him. Overwhelmed hospitals have been unable to accept patients for even the most life-threatening issues, including stroke and heart attack, the report said.
About two weeks ago, the Japan Times ran an article questioning how ready the nation’s hospital system would be for the rising pandemic. The article cited that cases had “quadrupled” over 10 days leading into April.

By James Thornhill

Oil extended its slide in Asia, trading at near two-decade lows after agreed cuts by the biggest producers were seen barely making a dent in the demand destruction wrought by Covid-19 and on increasing concerns that traders are quickly running out of room to store crude.

Futures in New York dropped as much as 5.5% to the lowest since November 2001, following a 20% slump last week. China reported its first economic contraction in decades on Friday, a sign of how bad things could get in Europe and North America, which have yet to emerge from virus lockdown.

Near-term prices for U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude are trading at huge discounts to later-dated contracts on concern the storage hub of Cushing, Oklahoma, will fill to capacity. That has seen prices disconnect from Brent futures in London.

“Concern continues to mount that storage facilities in the U.S. will run out of capacity,” ANZ Research said in a note. “Stockpiles at Cushing, the pricing point for WTI, are up nearly 50% since the start of March.”

U.S. crude posts another weekly drop as virus sends market out of balance

Still, there were at least grounds for cautious optimism at the weekend. New York Governor Andrew Cuomo said the state may be past the high point of coronavirus deaths, as cases and fatalities slowed. Fewer daily deaths were also reported in Italy, Spain and the U.K.

PRICES

WTI for May delivery was down 93 cents at $17.34 a barrel at 8:48 a.m. Sydney time.

The June contact declined 1.9% or 47 cents to $24.56.

Brent for June delivery fell 27 cents to $27.81 a barrel, after rising 0.9% to end at $28.08 on Friday.

Hedge funds were once again caught out by crude’s alarming descent, increasing their net-bullish position by 13% in the week ended April 14. It was the second straight week money managers boosted their net-long position in the face of 20% price drops in both weeks.

The price collapse is reverberating across the industry: oil explorers shut down 13% of the U.S. drilling fleet last week as the swelling worldwide glut of crude spurred drastic cost-cutting and project cancellations among drillers.

Crude prices in America’s oil capital are getting dangerously close to zero, with buyers in Texas offering as little as $2 a barrel for some oil streams, raising the possibility that producers may soon have to pay customers to take crude off their hands."

Of course, they can forget about most viruses because vaccines have made them not a problem any more. 

There are already vaccines from several animal coronaviruses (infectious bronchitis virus, transmissible gastroenteritis virus). Of the seven coronaviruses that infect humans, four are very mild, and no one bothered to make vaccines for them. SARS went away before vaccines could be put through licensing, but there were several tested in animals that look like they’re perfectly good vaccines. MERS is mainly a disease of camels, but there are vaccines for camels that look pretty good that are in development, and experimental human vaccines also look pretty good. And the seventh is SARS-CoV-19. 

So for just about every coronavirus we’ve bothered to make a vaccine for, it’s been effective.

NJ shut down their nursing homes early before any of them had any cases, and almost all of them have cases now. My husband's grandfather's nursing home shut down even before the state said they had to - all workers had to wear masks and were screened for symptoms, no visitors allowed, food is dropped off outside the residents's doors, etc etc. He still caught it a few weeks later and died from it, as did others in the home. I'm guessing nursing homes in states with less cases have fared better, but this is what happened in NJ when the virus got very widespread among the general population.

Also, some elderly are still in the work force. Is the government going to pay all their checks? I can't see the US government doing that. Not with the current administration. What about young people with chronic health conditions who are normally able to work and depend on a paycheck, but would be extremely high risk if they caught coronavirus? Is the government going to significantly expand disability? And what about their younger/healthier household members who will have to go back to work and will easily spread it to them?

Is he genuinely trying to promote the protests or is he intentionally promoting multiple protests to make it easy for some Reddit detective to gaslight everyone? Did \/u/Dr_Midnight create the groups and then act like they found some massive astroturf effort all for the karma?

Just because some jackass on the internet tries to capitalize off of actual groups organizing the protests doesn't mean anything.

For the first (and probably last) time in living memory, the whole world seems to care about the domestic policy of my plucky little home country. Sweden’s approach to dealing with coronavirus has been hailed by some, but the majority of commentators seem to think we’re conducting some kind of heartless and dangerous experiment. Even Donald Trump has attacked us. 

For those that aren’t aware, while the rest of the world has been shutting down schools, shops and restaurants, banning non-essential travel, and sending the police to shout at those who dare to dawdle in their local park, Sweden remains largely open for business. 

Our schools are full of students, and I can still visit restaurants in Malmo, where I’ve lived for more than 20 years. I’m working from home, but many offices remain open. I can have friends over for lunch. Should I want to, I could drive to the countryside for a weekend away. 

Ministers here have been forced to defend the policy, and the armchair experts on social media track our daily deaths with disturbing relish, but I'm proud of my country's stand. And, while some people I know would like to see stricter measures enforced, most of my friends here support it too. 

For starters, while we’re still “open for business”, it’s certainly not a case of “business as usual”. Everyone who can is advised to work from home, and the government has issued social distancing and hygiene guidelines. We’ve been urged to avoid large gatherings and crowded public transport, and to maintain a safe distance when socialising. However, these remain “guidelines”. Rather than imposing authoritarian rules and stripping people of their freedoms, we are relying on people’s collective common sense. 

And it appears to be working. While the high streets are open, they are much quieter than usual, and the majority are following the social distancing recommendations. For most Swedes, this isn’t much of an imposition. We are generally a self-reliant (some would say anti-social) bunch. In fact, many are rejoicing as they no longer have to make up an excuse to avoid going for a beer. 

The architect of our policy (the hero or villain, depending on your point of view) is state epidemiologist Anders Tegnell, and if the government trusts his advice - and that of the Folkhälsomyndigheten (Public Health Authority) - then that’s good enough for us. Here in Sweden, we trust our authorities. Corruption is rare, and our public agencies are politically independent. Why would the Public Health Agency give advice that is not in the best interests of people and society? They have no other agenda. Also, they’re disarmingly honest. Tegnell recently admitted: “We’re trying this strategy out. We don’t know if it will work or not. If it doesn’t, we’ll revisit it.” Indeed, no country knows which policy is best, or how exactly things will pan out, so why pretend otherwise?

It is also interesting to note that Sweden is one of the world's least religious countries, with around 90 per cent being atheist or agnostic. Many here think it’s actually dangerous to believe in things for which there is no concrete evidence. This is reinforced by an education system that encourages independent enquiry and evidence-based reasoning. We see that there is no hard evidence that draconian lockdowns stop the spread, so we keep shops open. We see that there is no evidence of widespread transmission in outdoor environments, so socialising in parks is still permitted. Furthermore, coronavirus conspiracies haven’t had any traction over here - our 5G towers are still intact. 

People say we are putting the economy ahead of saving lives, but the economy is lives. A stronger economy means better healthcare for everyone for years to come. Generally, Swedes like to play the long game and right now we’re thinking about the state of play two, five or even 10 years from now. It’s not just about beating the virus, it’s about coming out of the crisis healthy. It’s easy to tally up deaths from the disease, but what about the impact a lockdown will have in terms of unemployment, homelessness, mental illness, and suicides? One could even draw parallels with Sweden’s neutrality during the Second World War, which paved the way for the country to become an economic and social powerhouse in the post-war years. 

Perhaps our most controversial policy has been to keep schools open. But shutting schools would mean key workers, including doctors and nurses, would have to stay at home (or else kids would need to be sent to their grandparents, a high-risk group). Also, Swedes are considering the negative long-term consequences on our kids if they miss a half year of school. Since they are unlikely to contract the virus, isn’t it better that they should carry on studying?

Not everyone in Sweden supports our coronavirus policy. Marie-Claude Dubois, an architect in Malmo, told me: “So far 1,300 people have died here, is this a price worth paying for children to go to school and for life to continue more or less as normal? How many more are we willing to sacrifice?”

But the opinions of teacher Sofie Lejdström are more typical. “Locking people up could have catastrophic consequences for people’s mental health, and we’ve seen already that quarantines do not stop people dying,” she said.

“I believe this policy will slow the spread of the virus and keep the hospitals from filling up all at once. But I don’t believe we can stop the virus. Controlled spreading to create herd immunity doesn’t sound bad to me. It sounds like the best option given there is no vaccine. I don’t believe that acting out of fear and spreading fear will ever lead to anything positive.”"

> Sirimulla also is enlisting the help of volunteers through BOINC@TACC, a project that integrates volunteer computing and TACC’s supercomputers.

[TN-Grid](https://gene.disi.unitn.it/test/): [SARS-CoV-2 virus](https://gene.disi.unitn.it/test/forum_thread.php?id=265)

> We are actually expanding a lot of human genes, prioritizing them according to the scientists' interests. Among them this one (ACE2) https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/59272 which is closely related to the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Don't expect we will be able to 'find a cure' but we are trying to add something to better know our enemy.

However, please note this in-thread warning from the TN-Grid project admins:

> [The reason we don't advertise our COVID-19 work]: our very limited server resources. The server is running right now at almost its full speed, say that doubling the users will just hassle the server with no real benefits. We just submitted a project to answer a governmental call (COVID-19 related), among other things we asked for a server, hoping to get some money for it.

So I'd suggest keeping on eye on the TN-Grid news/forums, but ask for permission first before joining their project, so you don't accidentally DDoS it.

> The simulations that we are currently running in GPUGRID are going to be used to help protein folding, including proteins coming from the virus giving COVID19. As you know this effort started before the outbreak and would last for several more months.

> As soon as we are able to apply the current GPUGRID database simulations to perform studies related to COVID19 we will let you know the outcome.

> In summary, if you are running GPUGRID now, you are contributing to a longer term project that has implications for COVID19 but it is not just specific to it.

The truth is that it IS something happening in rural areas.  Big time.  The problem I think is that most of the data out there is showing TOTAL NUMBER of cases per state instead of DENSITY of cases.  So a state with low population looks like they are doing great, when in reality if you look at density (e.g. covid-19 cases per 100,000 people) then you see that [almost all](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/coronavirus-us-cases.html) the states are between 50-200 cases per 100,000.  10 states are above 200, and 6 states are below 50.  California is not a cesspool; they are doing pretty well at 78 cases per 100,000.   Iowa, Utah, Alabama, South Dakota, Louisiana, Georgia, Nevada, Indiana, Virginia, Ohio, Tennessee, Missouri, Idaho, New Hampshire, New Mexico, South Carolina, are all doing WORSE than California.  And other states like North Dakota, Wisconsin, Nebraska, Oklahoma, Kansas, Kentucky, and Wyoming are only a handful of cases better per 100,000 than California.

>	NEW YORK DAILY NEWS
>	APR 17, 2020 | 1:42 PM
>
>	A Wisconsin teen is suing sheriff’s officials who allegedly ordered her to delete an Instagram post about her suspected coronavirus infection because school officials didn’t believe her.
>
>	The lawsuit filed in federal court Thursday on behalf of Amyiah Cohoon and her parents, Richard and Angela, claims Marquette County Sheriff Joseph Konrath and a patrol sergeant violated the 16-year-old girl’s First and Fourteenth Amendment rights.
>	
>	According to the complaint, Amyiah, a high school sophomore, started suffering from a fever and dry cough shortly after she returned from a spring break trip to Disney World and Universal Studios in Florida with her high school’s band class that ended March 15.
>	
>	Her mother took her to the emergency room at Divine Savior Hospital in Portage, Wis., where doctors concluded her symptoms matched those of COVID-19, the lawsuit states.
>
>	Hospital officials could not test her due to the guidelines at that time, but they instructed her to self-quarantine and wrote on her discharge order she was diagnosed with an “acute upper respiratory infection, unspecified,” the complaint says.
>
>	The doctors also gave the Cohoons a work release form stating that “Amyiah has symptoms consistent with COVID-19,” according to the filing.
>
>	Amyiah posted about her medical scare on Instagram, saying she was recovering from “the COVID-19 virus” and wasn’t allowed to leave her room.
>
>	The teen returned to the hospital March 25 when her symptoms worsened, and a coronavirus test was administered that evening, the lawsuit states.
>
>	“The test came back negative, but the doctors told the Cohoons that Amyiah still likely had COVID-19 and had missed the window for testing positive,” the lawsuit claims.  
>
>	Amyiah again wrote about her experience on Instagram, posting a photo of herself at the hospital with an oxygen mask and saying, “I am finally home after being hospitalized for a day and a half. I am still on breathing treatment but have beaten the coronavirus.”
>
>	On March 27, a Marquette County Sheriff’s patrol sergeant was dispatched to the Cohoons’ home to order Amyiah to delete one of her posts or face arrest for disorderly conduct, the paperwork states.
>
>	Amyiah complied, due to the threat of jail time, but she believes her rights to free speech and equal protection were violated, the lawsuit filed on her behalf by the Wisconsin Institute for Law & Liberty argues.
>
>	Shortly after Amyiah removed the post, her family learned school officials sent an update to families in the district describing her posts as “nonsense.”
>
>	Sheriff Konrath and school officials did not immediately respond to requests for comment from the Daily News Friday.
>
>	Law enforcement’s “threats to cite and arrest Amyiah for posting about her experience are especially troubling in light of (school officials’) statements accusing Amyiah of not being truthful and engaging in ‘a foolish means to get attention,’” her lawsuit states.
>
>	“With the threats of law enforcement looming over her head, Amyiah has felt unable to respond on social media to (school officials’) allegations, and she is now afraid of returning to school for fear of what her classmates and teachers will think about her,” the filing in the Eastern District of Wisconsin states."

That is, only 1 of a total of 248 tests responded false positively (in a negative control group). “Among the negative controls included samples from 80 healthy adult blood donors taken in 2018 (ie before the virus that causes covid-19, by a good margin, were in circulation in humanity) and since the vast majority of adults in Sweden have had several infections with the 4 common ""cold-coronavirus types"" ”(OC43, NL63, 229E and HKUI), the published evaluation clearly shows that there are also no problems with false reactions due to antibodies to these four milder variants of coronavirus infections."

Sorry in advance for the major bummer. Found out today my dog has cancer after a visit to the emergency vet. It's not treatable and the best we can hope for is to make her comfortable for her remaining time. In a pandemic. It's honestly too much and my ability to cope has flown out the window. I knew something was wrong, something likely very bad, but I tried so hard to convince myself it was going to be a fixable problem. She's only nine years old and I lost another dog around that age to another type of cancer only two years ago.

Wasn't sure whether to put this in OT or not but thought I'd add that the coronavirus angle made the whole visit extra surreal. I called ahead and they naturally are trying to dissuade people from coming by asking tons of questions and making sure it's an emergency. The staff was very kind but I wish I could have been with my girl for the visit and exam. Just hating every thing right now."

You are delusional if you dont take this into account tbh...

All the pieces of the puzzle are there, when you put them together this appears a logical solution.

- 2 labs in China near Wuhan ground zero carrying out research on Coronavirus in bats.

- These labs have been carrying out research since 2008 with proven lax controls, whether in the lab or collecting samples.

- The US stopped funding these research teams a few years back due to gain of function concerns.

- SARS itself has escaped from Chinese labs 4 times.

- CDC Team when visiting one of the labs a few years back sent 2 emergency communications back expressing concern at lax controls.

- First 13 infected individuals show no link to the wet market.

- Late last year one of the labs published findings  showing discovery of a new potentially dangerous Coronavirus and posted a job vacancy for a scientist to assist in the research.

- One of the researchers in the Wuhan lab, Huang Yanling has gone missing, she is speculated to have been Patient 0, when the lab was asked about this they denied she ever worked there. Her profile was removed from the webpage, only when shown evidence did they eventually admit she worked there. Even though the Chinese authorities saw fit to issue a notice saying she is safe and well, she is yet to be found.

- Recently Luc Montagnier, the Nobel Prize winner for the 2008 discovery of the Aids virus stated that he believed the virus looks like it may have been tampered with in regard to HIV strands which he says could not have occurred naturally.

Dont be so closed minded to other ideas, the majority of what you term ""tin foil people"" who have been following this has said has been proven correct.

Opinions are to be welcomed, not ridiculed as that is how we progress, right?

Personally I do believe it escaped one of these labs and I don't have a tin foil hat...

It's just a matter of time before the truth comes out, at the moment there is a lot of concerning data; it just needs to be pieced together.

>It is only the first 17 days after the application of the containment measures to determine the extent of the spread of the infection in the Covid-19 pandemic, which seems to depend exclusively on the outbreaks that broke out by chance in the first days (such as the one that happened at the hospital in Codogno or the Atalanta – Valencia match) and not by the differences in the rigor of the lockdown. Consequently, any restrictive measure applied after the first 17 days (such as the closure of industries or prohibitions on the freedom of movement of citizens) has little or no effect on the progress of the infections and on the final number of victims. This is the result of a series of studies launched by an international team of Italian-led scientists, resulting in an extremely precise predictive model of the victims, which coincides in all countries, even in those where the industries have never been closed and the citizens are free to move, such as Germany or Sweden."

NEW YORK (1010 WINS) – Broadway actor Nick Cordero had to have his leg amputated Saturday because of complications from the coronavirus, his wife said.

In an Instagram Story late Saturday, Amanda Kloots wrote Cordero “made it out of surgery alive and is headed to his room to rest and recover.”

Earlier on Saturday, Kloots said blood thinners that had been given to Cordero to help with clotting in his legs caused internal bleeding in his intestines.

“We got some difficult news yesterday. Basically we’ve had issues in his right leg with clotting and getting blood down to his toes and it just isn’t happening with surgery and everything. So they had him on blood thinners for the clotting,” Kloots said.

“Unfortunately, the blood thinners were causing some other issues—blood pressure and some internal bleeding in his intestines,"" she said. ""So we took him off the blood thinners. But that again was going to cause some clotting in the right leg, so the right leg will be amputated today.”

Cordero has been in intensive care at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles since March 31, when he was admitted with breathing problems, Variety reported. He was eventually diagnosed with COVID-19; his condition worsened and he had to be placed on a ventilator. 

Cordero had to undergo emergency surgery on April 12 after his health declined. Kloots said he had to be resuscitated after he lost consciousness while battling an infection in his lung.

Cordero was nominated for a Tony for his role as Cheech in the musical “Bullets Over Broadway.”

Fans have been using the hashtag #WakeUpNick to support him and Kloots, and a GoFundMe has raised over $200,000.

Kloots and the couple's 10-month-old son have been sending Cordero videos each day so he could see them when he wakes up."

You’re welcome to block anyone that has a different position than you do - may I recommend Facebook? 

Surely that’d be a more efficient use of your time if an echo chamber is what you’re looking for.

Here’s the summary you surely didn’t read. 

“I think the authors of the above-linked paper owe us all an apology. We wasted time and effort discussing this paper whose main selling point was some numbers that were essentially the product of a statistical error.

I’m serious about the apology. Everyone makes mistakes. I don’t think they authors need to apologize just because they screwed up. I think they need to apologize because these were avoidable screw-ups. They’re the kind of screw-ups that happen if you want to leap out with an exciting finding and you don’t look too carefully at what you might have done wrong.

Look. A couple weeks ago I was involved in a survey regarding coronavirus symptoms and some other things. We took the data and ran some regressions and got some cool results. We were excited. That’s fine. But we didn’t then write up a damn preprint and set the publicity machine into action. We noticed a bunch of weird things with our data, lots of cases were excluded for one reason or another, then we realized there were some issues of imbalance so we couldn’t really trust the regression as is, at the very least we’d want to do some matching first . . . I don’t actually know what’s happening with that project right now. Fine. We better clean up the data if we want to say anything useful. Or we could release the raw data, whatever. The point is, if you’re gonna go to all this trouble collecting your data, be a bit more careful in the analysis! Careful not just in the details but in the process: get some outsiders involved who can have a fresh perspective and aren’t invested in the success of your project.

Also, remember that reputational inference goes both ways. The authors of this article put in a lot of work because they are concerned about public health and want to contribute to useful decision making. The study got attention and credibility in part because of the reputation of Stanford. Fair enough: Stanford’s a great institution. Amazing things are done at Stanford. But Stanford has also paid a small price for publicizing this work, because people will remember that “the Stanford study” was hyped but it had issues. So there is a cost here. The next study out of Stanford will have a little less of that credibility bank to borrow from. If I were a Stanford professor, I’d be kind of annoyed. So I think the authors of the study owe an apology not just to us, but to Stanford. Not to single out Stanford, though. There’s also Cornell, which is known as that place with the ESP professor and that goofy soup-bowl guy who faked his data. And I teach at Columbia; our most famous professor is . . . Dr. Oz.

When we started getting more and more advice about Coronavirus in February, I thought it made sense to remind us that for some of us in certain age groups the greatest danger might not be getting infected, but rather making others infected who are vulnerable. By that token I'm happy to be more scrupulous with hand-washing and keep (for the time being) social distancing. I'm not even hostile to wearing a mask and in fact I've ordered one. However, I object to this new mindset where we are encouraged to constantly see ourselves as potential foci of infection and danger to our fellow human beings. I think to keep that mindset for more than a few weeks will be enormously destructive on a psychological and social level. I do sometimes become anxious when I pick up an item from the shelf in the supermarket and inadvertently touch the item next to it. I then remind myself that I'm in an area with very few cases, and hence the likelihood of me having the virus AND infecting someone through touching a packet of rice for 1 milisecond AND that someone not washing their hands and then becoming very ill and dying is probably something like 0.0001%. Withall  the research being conducted in the last few weeks, I think we now have a better idea of how the virus behaves and hence how much of a threat we personally pose to others (and I don't even like the idea of seeing ourselves as a ""threat""), yet the media and government keep pushing this idea that all of us are poison to all of our fellow human beings."

Influenza is nothing like the coronavirus, genetically, so it seems highly unlikely a flu specific test would confuse them. 

Second, pneumonia is a symptom, not any disease in itself. In flu, sure, bacteria sneak in while our immune system is busy with the flu, cause pneumonia, and kill people.
With COVID-19, the virus (and occasionally the body's own very confused immune system) is already attacking the lungs directly. You can't kill a virus with antibiotics."

https://www.livescience.com/new-coronavirus-compare-with-flu.html

> The death rate from seasonal flu is typically around 0.1% in the U.S., according to The New York Times.  
Though the death rate for COVID-19 is unclear, most research suggests it is higher than that of the seasonal flu.  
In the study published Feb. 18 in the China CDC Weekly, researchers found a death rate from COVID-19 to be around 2.3% in mainland China. Another study of about 1,100 hospitalized patients in China, published Feb. 28 in the New England Journal of Medicine, found that the overall death rate was slightly lower, around 1.4%.

So at coronavirus is at least ten times more fatal than seasonal flu.

There's a meme going around of facebook pointing out the seasonal flu killed more people this year than coronavirus, and citing figures from worldometers.info, but you can bet they aren't going to be updating it because Coronavirus overtook seasonal flu a little while ago and it's catching up on malaria and suicide now."

These people will get zero state support, and it is likely that hundreds of thousands, or even millions, will starve to death.  In India, over 3,000 children starve to death every day, yet they are currently 2 weeks into a month long lockdown.  They have migrant workers that are paid a few dollars a day, and immediately that they stop working, they will have no money at all.  It has already caused a massive crisis at the borders as migrant workers try and escape India, which has lead to crowds of tens of thousands of people all crammed together (not ideal during a pandemic) trying to escape the country.  The damage being done on the developing world is truly horrific.Unfortunately, almost noone actually cares about this that I've discussed it with, they just shrug and say something that amounts to 'we have to look after ourselves first'.

Tracy has already contracted and survived the virus (“My snakes eat bats and then I use my snakes to practice French kissing, so it was inevitable, Liz Lemon!”), so he would declare himself an immune “green person” and set out to help. (Tracy: “Like Mister Rogers said, ‘Look like the helpers.’”) So, dressed as a firefighter, he would volunteer his time delivering illegal box jellyfish to the elderly.

Jack would try to get Liz to go to the secret GE island off the coast of Connecticut: “It will just be the top executives, any wives under 40, and yes, Lauer will be there, but only because it was built into his deal years ago.” Liz refuses to go because of her desire to be egalitarian but also because everyone would probably be barefoot. Pass. She would shelter in place like nobody’s business and still somehow dodge sex with James Marsden.

Kenneth would be the most prepared, having grown up Eighth Day Resurrected Covenant of the Holy Trinity and observing its End of Days Countdown Calendar, which is different from most calendars. “For example, we’ve only had Christmas twice, but Easter is every four hours.” Jack would offer to buy Kenneth’s cupboard of canned chickpeas for a million dollars, but Kenneth would just give him two cans for free. “Hoarding is a sin, sir! Just like skateboarding or riding a horse you’re not related to!” —Tina Fey and Sam Means

During a Feb. 28, 2020, campaign rally in South Carolina, President Donald Trump likened the Democrats' criticism of his administration's response to the new coronavirus outbreak to their efforts to impeach him, saying ""this is their new hoax.""

What's False

Despite creating some confusion with his remarks, Trump did not call the coronavirus itself a hoax."
2020-04-19,tansub,ChapoTrapHouse,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChapoTrapHouse/comments/g471ez/vietnam_appreciation_thread/fnwl6c2/,"Vietnam is definitely a mixed socialist market economy. They have adopted market reforms in the late 1980s called the ""doi moi reforms"". But Vietnam still follows 5 years and 10 years plans. There is a plan for 2020-2025 and another plan for 2020-2030. 

I worked in an embassy in Vietnam in 2019 (even got to see Vietnam Premier Nguyen Xuan Phuc) and I was invited to the Vietnam Reform and Development Forum, essentially a meeting where the Vietnamese leadership explains their economic plans to the world. The Prime Minister explained that for the next 10 years Vietnam wants to improve its institutional system, develop the infrastructure network and promote human resources. He also mentioned the importance of investing in human resources, mainly in education. 

He said that Vietnam wants to develop a dynamic and creative private sector. This definitely shows the capitalist turn that he Vietnamese communist party has taken. There was not any talk about how Vietnam was striving towards a communist society though, and many speakers were from the World Bank. 

At the end he explained that he wanted to invest in sustainable development but right after that he said he Vietnam was going to build a new mega airport next to Saigon (seems a bit contradictory). 

In Vietnam I would say people tend to listen more to their government than in the State, there protests against coronavirus lockdown is just unthinkable. Since Vietnam isn't as rich as say South Korea and Taiwan they didn't test massively but instead they have very strict quarantine measures, practically house arrest if you are suspected of having the virus. It's draconian but it seems to work, no one has died of the covid so far.

So Vietnam's response to the coronavirus crisis is not related to its healthcare system and more to the power that the government has over its people. Vietnam's healthcare system is pretty decent though, they are working towards universal healthcare and healthcare is free if you're poor. They also have good infrastructure especially in Hanoi and Saigon. I would rather be sick in Vietnam than in the States."

[The Economist](https://www.economist.com/graphic-detail/2020/04/13/deaths-from-cardiac-arrests-have-surged-in-new-york-city) has a chart. 

Amount of 9-11 calls for heart attacks jumped from under 100 a day in March 2019 to over 300 a day in March 2020. 

Coronavirus can release something called inflammatory cytokines which can cause inflammation of organs including the heart making you much more prone to heart attacks. Added into that lack of oxygen in the blood puts strain on the heart to pump harder. 

China back in February had also reported similar spikes in the amount of cardiac arrests and people needing heart transplants as linked to Coronavirus."

“The W.H.O. really blew it,” President Donald Trump tweeted on April 7, referring to the World Health Organization. “For some reason, funded largely by the United States, yet very China centric. We will be giving that a good look.”

Trump’s tweet, coincidentally, came on World Health Day, which honors health care workers around the world and celebrates the 1948 founding of the World Health Organization. The global health institution was created in a post-World War II world, based on the belief the planet had to work together to fight diseases and promote the health of all citizens.

And when a pandemic like the coronavirus happens, it’s obvious why the world needs an institution to help coordinate resources and distribute information.

But the WHO has come under pressure for its handling of the coronavirus, including whether it was too slow to declare a global health emergency and too generous in its praise of China for its handling of the outbreak.

Whether or how the WHO misstepped is up for debate. But President Trump, at least, has decided that the WHO failed to do enough, and this week announced his intention to halt funding for the agency."

There's an imperial ton of astroturfing going on, and it's quite visible in how those groups popped up literally overnight (hint-hint). The thing is that they targeted groups who were... how does one say... more receptive to the message who wouldn't be inclined to look any deeper into what they were joining.

As an example, [right now, this is happening in Los Angeles.](https://www.reddit.com/r/LosAngeles/comments/g3bzm1/large_reopen_california_protest_on_main_street/)

Now, [here's a screenshot of the description of the ""Operation Gridlock Los Angeles"" group](https://img.buzzfeed.com/buzzfeed-static/static/2020-04/17/22/asset/e0f5dcf081a3/sub-buzz-2654-1587161925-14.png) when it was first spotted by [Buzzfeed News.](https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/salvadorhernandez/coronavirus-quarantine-protests-facebook-groups)

Okay...

Now [here's a link to the group ""Minnesotans Against Excessive Quarantine""](https://www.facebook.com/groups/2996185320466628) - presently with 18,938 members.

Why do these groups have the exact same description? 

Let's not stop there. Following their own links: one is from the ""Pennsylvania Firearms Association"", and the other is from the group ""Minnesota Gun Rights"" - both with the exact same layout.

Both of these domains are registered with the same registrar and were registered on the exact same day at the same time.

The rest of the whois information is obscured by a proxy organization that provides privacy for whois records (I even use them myself as do many others for privacy reasons), so I cannot tell *who* owns these domains. 

Following the pattern of their sites, I checked for ""reopenmd.com"", but it never resolved to anything. That said, the DNS lookup itself didn't result in a `NXDOMAIN` error which tells me the domain does exist.

Registered a little more than week later with the same registrar. The thing is, they didn't actually complete their whois information this time, and whoever set it up cheaped out or forgot to pay for the Domains by Proxy service. Although whois information is literally a public record, I'm not inclined to place my account at risk by opening myself up to accusations of doxxing. That said, anyone who feels inclined to can go to https://whois.godaddy.com and search for `reopenmd.com`. I myself would be personally curious as to why someone in Florida is registering domains claiming to be gun rights organizations in other states.

Seriously, even without that information - who or whomever is responsible for this astroturfing couldn't make this more obvious if they tried. It honestly took me longer to type all of this up to present here than it did for me to find this all. Yet people have taken the bait hook-line-and-sinker.

I've noticed a trend of older people in our lives (our parents, older relatives) saying something along the lines of ""If you could just wait 6 or 12 months more, housing prices will probably fall from coronavirus, and you could get a better deal on this exact house"". The problem is, I think older relatives / parents have different priorities. They want you to get the best deal and to save as much money as possible, but they may not take into account the fact that there are tons of other legitimate reasons to want to buy a house now, as opposed to waiting. Also, it's almost futile to try and time the market during an uncertain time like this. If you were a house flipper and not buying a primary residence, then of course you probably would want to wait and see how the market plays out. But if you're buying a home for the emotional satisfaction, to be able to call yourself a homeowner, to settle yourself and/or family in for the next decade...then there's really no reason for you to wait up to another year (unless you're willing to wait this long) just to see if prices decrease by whatever percentage point. If you look at numbers from the 2008 crisis, housing values recovered completely within 10 years. So if you're planning to live in and enjoy the home for at least that long, then you have almost nothing to worry about. And you say you value getting the home sooner rather than later, so for you in particular, buying a house now is a sound decision that stays in line with your life/career goals. So I say, try to take what your father says with a grain of salt, congratulations and go for it!"

You might want to tell the Church that, because for the vast majority of Church history, the Kiss (Sign) of Peace was done only by the priest and ministers.

>So removing the ability for people to seek a blessing from God and to receive his protection is perfectly okay. Got it.

Yes. Bishops are within their authority to suspend the distribution of a sacramental within their diocese. Deal with it. You don't need holy water to ask for or receive God's blessing and protection. That's superstition.  If people want a fake talisman for ""protection"", they can join Buddhism. 

>No. Governors told them that they needed to close. The Church has worded it to make it sound like it was voluntary, but lets not kid ourselves. Attending church is an obligation, not a luxury.

Ok. As far as I know, Bishops are well within their authority to close down Churches on the orders of secular authorities and dispense with the obligation to attend Mass, if they deem it prudent. Deal with it.

>Ask and you shall receive. https://cruxnow.com/church-in-the-usa/2020/03/amid-coronavirus-sacrifices-some-bishops-allow-friday-meat-in-lent/

Thank you for the source. As far as I'm aware, Bishops are well within their authority to dispense with the obligation to abstain from meat on Lenten Fridays, if they deem it prudent. Deal with it.

>Under normal circumstances I would agree that the sacred body and blood of Christ should NEVER be distributed in plastic. My point, is that Bishops from all over have made other concessions in the name of security, but, you seem to be drawing an arbitrary line.

This is not an arbitrary line. This has to do with the very validity and licitness of a *Sacrament Itself.* *No Bishop on their own has the ability to change the fundamental way that a Sacrament is celebrated.* What's so difficult to understand about that?"

However, the resolved cases, of which there are **789,841; 164,930** have ended in death. thats 21%. however just because 21% of resolved cases have ended in death does not mean that it represents the actual mortality rate. apparently it also factors in age, so adding in that metric, for the average person, chances of death are currently estimated somewhere around 3%, although the jury is still out."

No, it's a ~~20%~~ 16% *closed-case* fatality rate, or cCFR. And check the link -- 21% cCFR is what has been recorded *everywhere*. That's the worldwide average.

https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/

The traditional CFR calculation (current deaths / current cases) will dramatically underestimate the final CFR when you're dealing with a pandemic undergoing rapid exponential growth. If case numbers have been doubling every 5 days, and if deaths typically happen after 20 days, only 6.25% of the current cases would be at least 20 days old, so your current CFR will underestimate the final CFR by 16x. Using cCFR corrects for that bias.

The CFR has two biases versus the true IFR:

1. Undercounting of mild cases
2. Undercounting of future deaths

The cCFR corrects the second bias, but not the first. Random sampling corrects the first bias, but not the second. That's why we need to combine both.

> and it’s likely that initial testing only caught very severe cases

That's why I used the antibody sample (32% positive, 12k estimated infections) for the IFR denominator. Doing widespread serological testing is how you fix bias #1.

> LOL @ China extensively testing.

By Feb 28, China had performed [320,000 tests in Guangdong Province alone](https://www.sciencealert.com/here-s-how-many-coronavirus-tests-per-capita-have-been-completed). Despite that testing, there have only been 1532 confirmed cases in Guangdong, indicating a positive test result rate of 0.48%. In comparison, the USA has currently done 3,861,382 tests, of which 763,594 came back positive, for a positive test result rate of 19.8%. ([source](https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/))

Unfortunately, we don't know how many tests were performed nationwide in all of China. If we assume that Guangdong had the same number of tests per capita as the rest of China (and ignoring the fact that Hubei probably had more tests than the rest of China combined), that would predict 4 million tests performed in China as of Feb 28th, with 86,306 positive results, for a positive test result rate of 2%."

[four more years](https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=2451&v=E5TxKP7uiGo&feature=emb_title). He declared not only that he’d support Donald Trump in 2020, but that he’ll almost certainly support Republican presidential candidates the rest of his life. Mohler focused on the classic culture war issues—marriage, sexuality, constitutional interpretation, and abortion. He expressed the belief that the “partisan divide had become so great” and Democrats had “swerved so far to the left” on those key issues that he can’t imagine ever voting for a Democratic president. He also claimed that Trump has been “more consistent in pro-life decisions” and consistent in the quality of his judicial nominations than “any president of the United States of any party.”

To me, I think we are at a pivotal moment that will define what both American conservatism and white Christian evangelicalism will be for many, many years. American conservatism, which has real intellectual history and heft, has been and is comingling with Trumpism these past three and a half years. The natural questions that come out of this is whether conservatism does and will live outside of Trump or whether Trump and his brand of politics will redine conservatism and what it means to be a Christian.

&#x200B;

Trump is not nearly one man; he is the President of the most powerful country in the world, hiring many people around him who are likely to kowtow to his interests, and very much represents the Republican party at this point. He's the man who was chosen by the voters to beat 15 other prominent and powerful Republican candidates in 2015/2016. He also represents both a populist movement and an essential power broker in the culture war that the voter has leveraged against their political enemies. In many ways, he gets to dictate how conservatism gets to appear and work. You could also say that he is *changing* conservatives.

&#x200B;

For David French - someone who has been a true believer in conservatism and evangelical Christianity, notably at the National Review and now at The Dispatch - Trump greatly damages what conservative white evangelicals have represented. He brings up an important point that I don't think gets brought up enough:

&#x200B;

>""White Evangelicals are squandering any argument that they seek to love their enemies. That means we’ll see more hate from America’s bully pulpit.  
>  
>....  
>  
>White Evangelicals are not only squandering any argument that competence matters, they are working hard to try to force more incompetence on their American community. Trump’s impact on the welfare of the American city is increasingly clear. It’s more division. It’s more hate. It’s more incompetence. And now that terrible combination has yielded a series of dreadful errors in the face of a deadly pandemic.  
>  
>White Evangelicals, one of the most politically powerful religious movements in the entire world, should not use their power to maintain and ultimately renew the authority of one of the most malignant and incompetent politicians ever to hold national office. They shouldn’t, but they will. ""

&#x200B;

I think David French wants to hold conservative white evangelicals to a higher standard, which in many ways is to say that their belief structure should want and expect better. Instead, he says they will choose not only downright divisiveness, but more dangerously, incompetence.

However, GILD did experience a large jump up at open on friday, like most other stocks. Except a few things were off:

* Volume was very low.

* What contributed to the company's jump was an announcement of their testing of a new drug to fight Coronavirus, Remdesivir.

However, after further reviewing these tests, the sampling method was dubious and the results (68% recovery rate) are divisive at best. On top of that, the test lacked a placebo group and the sample itself was non-randomised.

I think it was just a severe knee-jerk reaction to an unproven, shoddily put-together trial. It already failed in China twice because of the lack of enrollment in the Remdesivir trial.

• December 2019 - Health officials in Taipei said alerted the WHO about the risk of human-to-human transmission of the new virus but said its concerns were not passed on. [9]

• January 3 (2020) - Chinese authorities had already ordered COVID19 virus samples destroyed, silenced Wuhan doctors, and censored public concerns online. [9]

• January 14 - WHO states: ""Chinese authorities have found no clear evidence of human-to-human transmission"" [9]

• January 26 - Dr Fauci, the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) Director states that rhe coronavirus ""isn't something the American public needs to worry about or be frightened about"" [1]

•January 31: Trump sets up a Coronavirus task force that ""coordinates and oversees the Administration's efforts to monitor, prevent, contain, and mitigate the spread"" of COVID-19. [2]

•January 31: Trump declared a “public health emergency” and bans travel from China into USA. [3]

This travel ban with China, was actually opposed by Joe Biden, Mike Bloomberg, Nancy Pelosi, & Chuck Schumer. Unfortunately for them, WHO experts admitted Trump’s actions saved lives in the United States. [4]

The WHO also was against the travel ban. [10]

Dr. Ronny Jackson, who served as White House physician from 2013 to 2018, stated: ""The president has done everything he needed to do in this case,"" he said. ""He’s acted QUICKLY and DECISIVELY. He did what he always has done ... he went with his instincts."" [4]

•February - Joe Biden, during a primary debate, accused President Trump of cutting funding the CDC and NIH. WRONG. According to an Associated Press fact-check, proposed budget cuts never happened, and funding increased. The CDC grant program decline was set in motion by a congressional budget measure that predates Trump. [4]

•February 12 - CDC says some tests distributed by the agency deliver “inconclusive” readings. The C.D.C. will need to ship new ingredients, further delaying results. [5]

•February 26 - U.S. Vice President Mike Pence was named to chair the Coronavirus task force, and Deborah Birx was named the response coordinator. [2]

•March 10 - Trump pushes for economic relief for US citizens. [6]

•March 11 - WHO declares coronavirus a Pandemic. [7]

•March 26 - Dr Birx criticizes the fake-news mainstream media, by informing that NY still has ICU beds remaining, and ""there are still, significant, over a thousand or two thousand ventilators that have not been utilized yet"". [8]

•March 27 - the CARES Act is signed into law, a $2 trillion coronavirus economic stimulus bill. [9] It had been delayed by Pelosi trying/failing to add in items like changes to election law & implement parts of their Green New Deal.

•April 16 - Trump cuts WHO funding for 60-90 days, pending a review of it's role in “mismanaging” the coronavirus. [10]

Ps: I didn't include all the times Trump tried to keep the people calm by saying we have it all under control.

2020-04-19,BarrettBuckeye,Conservative,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/Conservative/comments/g47fri/the_lockdown_could_end_up_being_more_deadly_than/fnwxme0/,"This article was written a couple of weeks ago, and you can tell because of the numbers they cite for the projected deaths of COVID-19. They first cite the projection of 2 million American deaths from COVID-19, and then they cited the number that they had at the time of writing of 240,000 projected deaths (anywhere from 100,000 - 240,000 based on what I'm assuming is a 95% confidence interval). Now, when you look at their numbers for suicide and domestic violence deaths, it would look like the causes of death related to the impact of closing the economy were still far lower (somewhere in the tens-of-thousands order of magnitude based on what I understand from the projections in this article) than the projected deaths of COVID-19. Currently, there are about [60,000 projected deaths by August](https://covid19.healthdata.org/united-states-of-america) (34,000 - 140,000 95% CI) from coronavirus according to IHME models, and now it looks like the balancing act of weighing COVID-19 deaths versus deaths of dying from the social and government response to coronavirus is a serious question. If that number is still on the higher side of that confidence interval, and we see 100,000 deaths, then maybe we need to be more concerned about coronavirus than we do the economy. If that number is at or lower the projection, then you're not saving any lives, and in fact, you may be contributing to even more deaths than the virus from the shutdown. 

I would like to point out that one thing that I think Pell and Lesser missed in their consideration is the diversion of healthcare resources and personnel to fighting coronavirus while other patients still need treatments for their conditions. When [heart surgeries are deemed non-essential](https://old.reddit.com/r/Conservative/comments/g3pg83/pretty_sad_that_abortion_deemed_essential_while/), then you're likely putting more patients at risk from dying from their heart conditions; in the thread that I just linked to, the top comment was from a user who didn't have access to radiological imaging equipment for assessing the state of his cancer. What's worse is that I can't seem to find any guidelines detailing what is an essential heart surgery. Does that mean that we stop administering stent angioplasties to patients with angina pectoris? That could lead to some patients suffering from a heart attack. Do we really want to limit CTs and MRIs from cancer patients? What if their cancer progresses to a stage that requires a different medical intervention? How many of them die as a result? In addition to the concerns raised in this article, there are other ways to die, and if we're diverting medical resources away from patients because we deemed their procedure to be elective when it may have been very necessary to prolong their lives, then there's a chance that there would be even more deaths from things that aren't associated with coronavirus than what has been considered here."

Capitalists can only amass surplus value from labor, so they need their workers back ASAP, regardless of the risk.

But, I think it's also the case that death rates are highly inflated due to the simple fact that the majority of the population isn't being tested. When they are, the epidemic looks a lot better:

https://www.livescience.com/coronavirus-antibodies-widespread-in-santa-clara.html

Furthermore, most of the deaths (at least 75%) are happening in people who already have pre-existing conditions, regardless of age group:

https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/coronavirus-age-sex-demographics/

So, the decision would be, what level of protection is necessary and why? Ideally, this kind of quarantine is probably the best solution, but the government and wealthy don't want to pay for people to stay home, to prevent social unrest, and they want to continue to operate their businesses and profit. Hence the astroturfing.

But, from what I know, the actual health implications of the pandemic are such that we mostly need to protect the old and people with pre-existing conditions. There's a lot of paranoia going on, even in the healthcare world, and I'm not sure it's warranted.

Living in capitalism sucks. But people actually will suffer without work because they have no other options. We are stuck in this master-slave dialectic. And even then there's the third side of the coin ;) which is that those protesters (and capitalists) think that just because things reopen, the economy is going to bounce right back, which is most likely false:

>Two months before the novel coronavirus is thought to have begun its deadly advance in Wuhan, China, the Trump administration ended a $200-million pandemic early-warning program aimed at training scientists in China and other countries to detect and respond to such a threat.

The project, launched by the U.S. Agency for International Development in 2009, identified 1,200 different viruses that had the potential to erupt into pandemics, including more than 160 novel coronaviruses. The initiative, called PREDICT, also trained and supported staff in 60 foreign laboratories — including the Wuhan lab that identified SARS-CoV-2, the new coronavirus that causes COVID-19."

You’re divorced/not together anymore. Kids are not highly susceptible to the virus. There are lots of married parents out there who are first responders and they aren’t being barred from going home to their kids at the ends of their shifts; taking the same precautions they take is all anyone can ask.)

In the long term, if you’ve been having your son all of this extra time, please document it. Try to recreate all of the extra time you’ve had him so that you can either get additional official custody or you can protect yourself if your ex tries to do so.

This is also why it's so dangerous to roll out vaccines in 12-18 months and so on. The scariest thought of all, and the one that needs years, actual many long years, of study, is correlation between other failed coronavirus (not COVID-19) vaccines and this one. One fascinating aspect of COVID-19 is that the young people are much less suscestible. 

Multiple older SARS / MERS vaccines never went to human trial because they killed animals that got infected by or were inoculated for other similar respiratory diseases. A natural hypothesis to form which no self-respecting scientist would put in a paper without extensive study is that COVID-19's severity is affected by the variety and number of previous respiratory ailments you've had in your lifetime and recovered from. 

And if it is indeed like other coronaviruses and humans form no long-term immunity, we're all wearing hazmat suits in the future and passing through multiple anti-contamination airlocks in every space."

2020-04-19,Noisy_Toy,Coronavirus,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/g4es7k/indiana_basketball_tragedy_5_fans_who_attended/fnwz0yw/,"It was the hottest ticket in the state for high school basketball. Four great teams. An electric atmosphere was guaranteed for the night of March 6 at Lawrence Central, where 2,800 fans would pack the gym for the sectional semifinals.

But early on that Friday afternoon, the calls started coming in to Lawrence Central.

It was revealed by state officials at 11 a.m. that the first person in Indiana had tested positive for coronavirus at Community Health North, four miles from the school.


“We started getting calls,” Lawrence Central athletic director Ryan Banas said, “wondering if we were still going to play.”

The games were played that night — and the following night — just like they were in 63 other venues around the state. Fans at Lawrence Central that week for Sectional 10 were treated to a basketball bonanza of incredible games and individual performances.

But on that night of March 6, there were five people in the gym who later died after testing positive for coronavirus. There’s no way to know if they contracted it at Lawrence Central. But families are left to mourn.

Paul Loggan was there, standing much of the game at the end of North Central’s bench. Roscoe Taylor was there, sitting in the lower level of Warren Central section. So was Charles Johnson, three rows up behind the Warren Central bench and next to his wife, Kay. Larry Rush was there, too, in the Lawrence North section, one of the “Four Horsemen” of Wildcat fans. And Jim DeSalle took a seat for the second game, near the Lawrence North bench. The following night, he would climb a ladder, smile and clip a piece of the sectional championship net.

In the coming days or weeks, all five men would die from health complications caused by the coronavirus. At least a dozen others who were there have tested positive or experienced symptoms consistent with the virus.

“The problem with any communal event like a basketball tournament is that you’ve got a clustering of people in close proximity,” said Dr. Cole Beeler, infectious diseases doctor at Indiana University Health.

There is no way to pinpoint exactly when the virus spread. Loggan, 57, was only at Lawrence Central one night, for a little more than two hours. He worked around hundreds of people all day, every day. DeSalle, 70, attended a Lawrence Township youth basketball event the day of the sectional championship game. Rush, 67, was an Uber driver. Johnson, 78, went to the grocery store and church that weekend. Taylor, 43, was around kids and adults in his job as a cafeteria worker at Stonybrook Middle School.

Hindsight is 20/20. On March 6, the reality is the people inside Lawrence Central’s gym — or any other high school gym in the state — were not thinking about the possibility of contracting coronavirus. There were hugs. There were handshakes. There were high-fives. Everything that seemed normal about basketball still existed that weekend. It was not until later, with the benefit of time, that a more complete picture began to emerge.

“The sad thing looking back,” said Kay Johnson, the widow of Charles Johnson, “is that we didn’t know.”

***

What did we know on the afternoon of March 6?

About an hour-and-a-half before Banas first heard the news from a colleague, state officials revealed the first person in Indiana had tested positive for coronavirus. The man, who had recently returned from a trip to Boston, was said to be in isolation and not considered a high risk to develop severe illness.

“There is no ongoing risk to the public,” state department of health commissioner Dr. Kris Box said that day in relation to that specific case.

Box encouraged Hoosiers to cover their coughs, wash hands thoroughly, elbow bump instead of shaking hands and stay home if sick before adding: “The situation with COVID-19 is changing rapidly and we can expect to see other cases in Indiana in the future.”

Darren Thomas, the district athletic director for Indianapolis Public Schools, called Banas early that afternoon to ask if the sectional would move forward as planned. Banas, after talking to his administration, reached out to the Indiana High School Athletic Association. At 2:05 p.m., the IHSAA issued the following statement:

“We will continue to monitor the developments and listen to medical experts and if it becomes necessary to make adjustments to high school sporting events, we will work with our member schools to take every precaution to ensure a healthy and safe environment for everyone involved.”

Just before 3 p.m., with the blessing of the other four athletic directors — Warren Central’s Marques Clayton, Crispus Attucks’ Chris Hawkins, Lawrence North’s Mike Penrose and North Central’s Paul Loggan — Banas sent a tweet from Lawrence Central’s athletic department Twitter account directing fans to the IHSAA statement, adding: “We have received numerous calls this afternoon regarding the coronavirus case in Marion County and the status of our sectional games tonight. The games will be played as scheduled.”

As they were in 63 other venues that night in Indiana, the games were played.

Another packed house watched as Warren Central junior Malik Stanley scored 34 points to outduel North Central super sophomore Leland Walker and his 30 points in a 77-69 win and Lawrence North rally from a five-point deficit in the final 1:37 to overcome Sincere McMahon’s 32-point outburst to win a 76-73 thriller over Crispus Attucks.

It was high school basketball at its best.

***

Late the next night, after Lawrence North wrapped up its first sectional title in five years, Lawrence North assistant Jim Stanbrough sat at a table with DeSalle at Alibi’s Grill on North Shadeland Avenue, a common postgame meeting spot for the coaching staff.

The rest of the Lawrence North staff was spread out among three other tables. There were smiles and laughs as they replayed the week. Sectional week started with a dominant performance on Wednesday in a win over rival Lawrence Central, followed by the close calls against Attucks and Warren Central. It was a time to unwind a bit before preparation started for the regional on March 14.

Stanbrough, 64, has replayed that night over and over in his mind. DeSalle, 70, fell ill a few days later and was hospitalized. He tested positive for coronavirus and died on April 1.

“That night is something I’ll never forget,” Stanbrough said. “Jim and I sat at a table, just the two of us. I’ll always remember that. Did I give it to him? Did he give it to me? I don’t know the answer. There were a lot of people connected to it.”

Stanbrough started feeling sick the next day. Three days later on March 10, he visited a doctor. He tested positive for the flu, but even with medicine he said he “kept going downhill.” Fevers. Dry coughs. Stanbrough visited the emergency room on March 17 and 19 and was sent home. Two days later, he was back again but this time he was admitted.

He tested positive for COVID-19 at IU Health North on March 23. Stanbrough stayed in the hospital for six days.

“I came home and got to feeling better for a couple days,” he said. “Then I started going south again and started having some pretty severe chest pains.”

On April 2, Stanbrough was readmitted and spent another six days in the hospital. An ultrasound discovered he had blood clots in both legs and his lungs. Stanbrough, who had no pre-existing health conditions, will be on blood thinners for several months. His wife, Marta, also tested positive for coronavirus, though her symptoms were limited to losing her senses of taste and smell.

“Those first couple days I went in, I was very scared,” Stanbrough said. “You start thinking about things you don’t want to think about. Who is going to take care of this or that. You start thinking about those things.”

That same week DeSalle and Stanbrough started to feel ill, Gerad Good, another assistant on the Lawrence North staff, did too. Four days after the sectional championship, Good, 49, had chills. He slept in his traveling sweatsuit, wrapped in blankets. His temperature rocketed to 102, then 103.

“Headaches were kind of the start of it,” Good said. “I had body aches and started taking Tylenol to heal some of that pain. I thought I was coming down with the flu or a sinus infection.”

Good twice visited the doctor and was told it could be a sinus infection. It was not until it was confirmed to him that both DeSalle and Stanbrough had tested positive for coronavirus that Good was able to also get tested. It, too, was positive.

For 17 days, Good said he had a fever that reached as high as 103.8 one night. Fortunately for Good, who is asthmatic, the virus never got into his lungs.

With some pathogens, such as the varicella-zoster virus (which causes chicken pox), infection confers near-universal, long-lasting resistance. Natural infection with *Clostridium tetani,*the bacterium that causes tetanus, on the other hand, offers no protection—and even people getting vaccinated for it require regular booster shots. On the extreme end of this spectrum, individuals infected with HIV often have large amounts of antibodies that do nothing to prevent or clear the disease.

When Roger Roth received an email from the Chinese government asking him to sponsor a bill in the Wisconsin state legislature praising China’s response to coronavirus, he thought it must be a hoax. The sender had even appended a pre-written resolution full of Communist party talking points and dubious claims for the Wisconsin senate president to put to a vote.  “I’ve never heard of a foreign government approaching a state legislature and asking them to pass a piece of legislation,” Sen Roth told me last week. “I thought this couldn’t be real.” Then he discovered it was indeed sent by China’s consul-general in Chicago. “I was astonished . . .\[and\] wrote a letter back: ‘dear consul general, NUTS’.”  It is impossible to see this episode as anything but another disastrous own goal in Beijing’s attempts to boost its global standing in the time of coronavirus.  From the deplorable treatment of African citizens in southern China to the export of faulty medical equipment, or the official endorsement of conspiracy theories blaming the US military for the outbreak, most of the Communist party’s efforts to control the international narrative have backfired.  Some assume the west’s chaotic and early response allows China to step into the global governance vacuum. Even allowing for questionable data, China has so far reported under 5,000 deaths, versus almost 30,000 in the US and nearly 20,000 each in Italy and Spain. But Beijing’s attempts to take advantage of the situation are more likely to leave it isolated and distrusted on the world stage when the crisis recedes.  Wang Jisi, a legendary scholar at Peking University, says the virus fallout has pushed Sino-US relations to their worst level since formal ties were established in the 1970s. He describes bilateral economic and technological decoupling as “already irreversible”.  The shift has been striking in the UK too, where influential Conservatives have called on the prime minister to be tougher on China, the British press has become more critical, and intelligence agencies have promised to focus on the threat from Beijing. In Europe and Australia, governments have rushed to block Chinese companies from buying assets cheaply amid economic carnage. And Tokyo has set aside $2.2bn explicitly to help Japanese companies move their supply chains out of China.  But it is not just the US and its allies that have soured on Beijing. North Korea, China’s only treaty ally, was the first country to close its northern border at the start of the outbreak, despite Beijing’s objections to international travel bans. Russia quickly followed. Even Iranian officials have criticised China for hiding the extent of the outbreak.  Some of the criticism is clearly unfair. Populist western politicians such as US president Donald Trump have attacked Beijing to deflect and distract from their own failings. There is also a hint of racism in the calls to shut down “disgusting wet markets”. But Beijing could have gained far more sympathy if it had switched quickly to a strategy of transparency and co-operation. Instead, it arrested people who criticised its cover-up, and launched a global propaganda campaign to raise doubts about the Chinese origin of the virus and assert the superiority of its authoritarian system.  Many multinational companies have been badly burnt since Beijing effectively sealed its borders and cancelled visas last month. The expulsion of much of the US press corps from Beijing will also harden international attitudes. China’s main government mouthpiece has even threatened to withhold medical supplies and block medical exports to the US so it can “cast America into a novel coronavirus hell”. Coronavirus: Ian Bremmer on tackling a global pandemic in a leaderless world  All this will accelerate calls in Washington and elsewhere for rapid decoupling from Chinese supply chains. This apparently self-defeating behaviour makes more sense when you consider the domestic political context.  This is the biggest crisis that President Xi Jinping has faced since he took power in 2012. The Communist party’s legitimacy has been damaged by early mistakes and the crackdown that followed. Mr Xi knows the coming economic crisis will erode support further. In the 2008 financial crisis, Beijing identified 8 per cent annual growth as the minimum to stave off social unrest. China’s economy shrank 6.8 per cent in the first quarter of this year.  Doubling down on vituperative nationalism can distract the populace, even if it damages China’s global reputation in the medium term. That explains why diplomats risked turning someone such as Senator Roth, a hitherto neutral bystander or even potential ally of Chinese trade diplomacy, into an enemy.  China’s goal was to publicise the resolution in state propaganda to validate party rule back home. But now the Wisconsin senator plans a very different bill. While praising the Chinese people, it will “strip the brutal Chinese Communist party naked for the world to see . . . as well as the damage it has done to the whole world through covering up this coronavirus,” Sen Roth said. It is likely to pass with a hefty majority."

Even with the higher 0.3% number, we're talking about something close to half the city being infected.

For comparison, Columbia University recently looked at all their maternity patients and found around 13% testing antigen positive.  This population is also likely to have more contact with the medical system over the course of the pregnancy, so their numbers might be a bit higher, but that's not too bad for a rough random sample.

And since I know my vote won't count for much, I've pledged to donate at least $100 of every paycheck I get to Biden, to phone-bank over the summer/fall, and to write post-cards for voters as well.

If anyone has any other ideas of what else I can do to help, I'm happy to hear them. I want Trump and the rest of his awful party out out OUT of power this fall!"

I have been sort of looking for something online that echoes this sentiment that I have personally felt, but can't express, especially in my work environment. 

As other essential workers have communicated to me, I feel torn between appreciating I have a job and being upset by my working conditions. The notion that budtenders are the ""front lines"" for this industry predates the Coronavirus. There is a real disconnect between our experiences and that of management. 

I was told the other day that transactions can be completed within just a couple minutes, which shocked me considering each one takes at least three times that when factoring in running in and out of the building once, twice, or even three times for order corrections. This running in and out has reinvigorated old injuries and health conditions. I am running in the heat, sweating, sometime dizzy and in the rain, socks soaked and cold. I am literally doing things that make you sick. 

I have accepted I will eventually get sick and looking forward to it is scary. On top of it all, I'm not making tips like I was and customers are always giving me crap for not being able to come inside. Or they are just plain unappreciative and agitated by the state of things. It has been infuriating for me at times and I have struggled to keep my composure."

Emergency use ICD codes for COVID-19 disease outbreak
 The COVID-19 disease outbreak has been declared a public health emergency of international concern.
 An emergency ICD-10 code of ‘U07.1 COVID-19, virus identified’ is assigned to a disease diagnosis of COVID-19         confirmed by laboratory testing.
 An emergency ICD-10 code of ‘U07.2 COVID-19, virus not identified’ is assigned to a clinical or epidemiological         diagnosis of COVID-19 where laboratory confirmation is inconclusive or not available.
 Both U07.1 and U07.2 may be used for mortality coding as cause of death. See the International guidelines for         certification and classification (coding) of COVID-19 as cause of death following the link below.
In ICD-11, the code for the confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 is RA01.0 and the code for the clinical diagnosis         (suspected or probable) of COVID-19 is RA01.1.

I found the real time diagnostics panel published by the CDC march 30, 2020. https://www.fda.gov/media/134922/download  
on page one it reads: 
""Results are for the identification of 2019-nCoV RNA. The 2019-nCoV RNA is generally detectable in upper and lower respiratory specimens during infection. Positive results are indicative of active infection with 2019-nCoV but do not rule out bacterial infection or co-infection with other viruses. The agent detected may not be the definite cause of disease. Laboratories within the United States and its territories are required to report all positive results to the appropriate public health authorities. 
Negative results do not preclude 2019-nCoV infection and should not be used as the sole basis for treatment or other patient management decisions. Negative results must be combined with clinical observations, patient history, and epidemiological information."" [ p. 1, para. 2,3 ]
If the test is negative for covid19 there still needs to be observation, consideration of patients medical history and epidemiological information. Epidemiological information is used to plan and evaluate strategies to prevent illness and as a guide to the management of patients in whom disease has already developed.
Some patients then might not have covid19 exposure but might still have the same symptoms from a different illness and that might be construed as covid. Or for those that are diagnosed positive it might be a co-infection or bacterial infection.
IMO there is a good probability all cases deemed corona positive might not be accurate  because of testing methods and coding parameters. But something has to be recorded.

https://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-52324218

According to the government's figures, 14,561 people have died in Guayas province since the beginning of March from all causes. The province normally sees 2,000 deaths a month on average.

https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/04/10/upshot/coronavirus-deaths-new-york-city.html

The numbers for the last two weeks of the period are even more stark: nearly 7,000 dead, more than three times as many deaths as would normally be expected this time of year.

https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/vsrr/COVID19/index.htm

Excess deaths are above 1000% in some places in Italy: http://content.dsadserver.com/Ciro/muni.html

New York City - (provisional, delayed) Deaths from all causes 21,077 - percentage of expected deaths 175%.

NYC excess deaths per capita (provisional): Approximately .15% - this after enacting a quarantine.

Guayas excess deaths per capita (provisional): Approximately .33% - they are trying to hold a quarantine but it clearly hasn't worked very well. They also caught it later.

Nembro Italy excess deaths per capita (provisional) Approximately 1%.

Typical flu death rate per capita: 1 in 10,000.

Typical flu death rate per infected: 1 in 1,000.

Guayas excess death rate per capita: 1 in 300.

NYC excess death rate per capita: 1 in 600.

Nembro, Italy excess death rate per capita: 1 in 100.

So we do know some certain things from experience already.

The CEBM analysis references Diamond Princess Cruise Deaths and says there are 6 fatalities, since they looked at that data the total fatality rate has reached 12.  

>In Iceland, where the most testing per capita has occurred, the IFR lies somewhere between 0.01% and 0.19%.

Iceland tested 50,000 people and uncovered 1727 infections, and its infection rate is now substantially reducing.  Of all the countries it shows the most likelihood of actually capturing the majority of those infected, everyone infected gets access to a non-stressed health system at its peak, at the very earliest stages of their illness.  

CMBE references 7 who have died, but now it's 9 which radically changes the CFR at such a small pool.  In addition it takes an average of 30 days from symptoms to register a death. Of the 1770 infected only 280 of them are over the age of 60 - deaths from flu under the age of 60 are less than .06%, so if you don't have old people getting infected you get a much lower death rate.  

Lastly half of those who tested positive were asymptomatic, so we would need an even higher percentage of asymptomatic to have a substantially lower IFR rather than CFR.   

The CFR fatality rate is currently at .5% and that's probably very close to their IFR as well (In a young population).  In addition if they misclassify 2 or 3 heart attack or pneumonia deaths then that will wildly skew their total fatality estimates.

Now compare this to our other discussion of Guayas having an excess death rate of .33% in a population of 3 million in the last 6 weeks.  

>We are tracking excess mortality (Assessment of Mortality in the Covid-19 outbreak to understand this phenomenon)  to determine how many excess deaths occur during the pandemic. Accurate data on deaths and cause of death (which is not forthcoming) is vital to determine the effect of the COVID pandemic.

As a final example, Florida has counted about 3,300 pneumonia deaths in the last 6 weeks and said around 200 of those are COVID.  They typically have 3000 pneumonia deaths in a year."

&#x200B;

**Mayor Joseph A. Curtatone and the Somerville Board of Health have issued a** [**public advisory**](https://www.somervillema.gov/sites/default/files/face-coverings-order-4-10-2020.pdf)  **that, starting immediately, everyone in Somerville should wear a clean  face covering, such as a fabric mask, scarf, or bandana, over their  mouth and nose when in any public establishment or common area.**  

&#x200B;

**Community members are also advised to wear face coverings when in parks,  on paths, or in other shared community spaces.**

&#x200B;

This applies when entering any sort of essential business currently  in operation such as grocery stores, pharmacies, laundromats, home  improvement stores, and restaurant pickup sites. Face coverings also  should be worn when entering and exiting multi-unit residences or  commercial buildings and when passing through hallways or other common  areas. 

The order is based on safety [guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/cloth-face-cover.html)  and will remain in effect until social distancing regulations designed  to prevent the spread of the coronavirus are eased. Members of the  public are advised this order is in addition to [existing social distancing guidelines](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/social-distancing.html),  not a replacement for them. It is still important to remain at least 6  feet away from people who are not part of your household, even when  wearing a mask.

“The important part about face coverings is they help prevent you  from spreading this disease to others. Your mask protects others. Their  mask protects you,” Mayor Curtatone said. “One of the scary parts of  COVID-19 is we can have it and be a danger to others even though we are  showing no symptoms. This will help protect the frontline workers who  are still on the job trying to make sure we stay healthy and fed during  this crisis. The people who stock the shelves at our local markets or  who operate the laundry establishments where we clean our clothes  deserve every protection we can afford them. Wearing a mask in the  common areas of multi-unit homes is also an important way you can help  protect your neighbors.”

Please note, infants and children under the age of 2 should not wear  face coverings, as it constitutes a hazard for them. The CDC also warns  that face masks should not be used by “anyone who has trouble breathing,  is unconscious or otherwise incapacitated, or is otherwise unable to  remove the mask without assistance.”

The City is aware of the current shortage of available masks, which  will make it difficult for some to wear a face covering. City officials  will be conducting spot checks at businesses to monitor compliance, but  if you see someone in public without a face covering, it could be due to  lack of available masks or an underlying health issue. Please leave  monitoring and enforcement to public officials. 

“We need people to be responsible solely for their own face  coverings,” Mayor Curtatone said. “We do not want people to confront  others or act as community monitors. Please wear a face covering, go  about your essential business, practice social distancing, then go home  and wash your hands. Please don’t make assumptions about or get involved  in anyone’s compliance but your own.”

Key elements to remember when wearing a face covering include:

&#x200B;

* It should fit snugly against the side of your face;
* It should be secured with ties or ear loops;
* It should have multiple layers of fabric;
* It should allow for breathing without restriction; 
* Fabric face coverings should be cleaned after each use and should be machine washable and dryer safe;
* Always remove the mask directly into the laundry or trash and then immediately wash your hands;
* Be careful not to touch your eyes, nose, or mouth when removing your mask.

Instructions for how to fashion a homemade face covering with no sewing required can be found at [https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/cloth-face-cover.html](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/cloth-face-cover.html).

NO ONE will hire you with this knowledge.  Get FIBER certified.  Screw being certified - just get good at doing it.

Staying on lockdown indefinitely is not a solution, and it is impractical. What are our options, like I said this virus will not disappear.

And I'm not ashamed of myself for my comment regarding the lockdown protests, this sub is called r/LockdownSkeptics after all. I never said that they were right, necessary, or that the people doing them were wise to do so, but I can fully understand why they do it. It's easy to just say that they're selfish idiots who only care about themselves, but considering the current state of ""I don't know"", ""no, can't open economy, too dangerous"", ""sorry bout your job but lives to save"", ""we don't know anything just stay home"", ""just stay home save lives"". Is that supposed to be the respectable position that everyone should take? Just sitting around while the world burns around us, with any plans to put out the fire being vaque or non-existent. At the very least, it's easy to see WHY people are protesting. Life has changed so drastically and there is no future planning. How long can you imagine staying in lockdown?

And I never said that I'm a scientist, or did any extensive research on this subject. Which is why I haven't made any big claims. Also I hope that I would have communicated that I'm not pushing for a specific conclusion, or saying how things need to be done. Maybe these lockdowns are necessary after all. I just think that this isn't sustainable as a long term solution, and there are no other solutions at all. Coronavirus is already guaranteed to have infected far more people than are tested, so now that begs the question.

I tried to make my post deliberately vague and open ended. I'm not pushing for anything specific, and I am not trying to downplay the virus. But I'm calling into question how long these measures can and should last. The economy is plundering, and that's dangerous in and of itself, and people are starting to get sick of it. That's what we're dealing with this, and I acknowledge a reality that involves COVID-19 as a part of everyday life, just like many other illnesses. Maybe I'm wrong, but what is a viable way forward?"

Will you listen to those scientists or are they not the right ones for your narrative right now?

From the CDC manual labeled Guidance for Certifying Deaths Due to Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID–19). Seems like the situation to falsely attribute COVID-19 is ripe. Do you really think the news or politically motivated doctors will care if COVID-19 is only listen as an underlying condition? They're going to report it was the sole cause, like they have been. No underlying condition asterisks, no age ranges. Nothing.

Put this through your mental gymnastic and take this however you will.


If COVID–19 played a role in the death, this condition should be specified on the death certificate. In many cases, it is likely that it will be the UCOD, as it can lead to various life- threatening conditions, such as pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). In these cases, COVID–19 should be reported on the lowest line used in Part I with the other conditions to which it gave rise listed on the lines above it. Generally, it is best to avoid abbreviations and acronyms, but COVID–19 is unambiguous, so it is acceptable to report on the death certificate. In some cases, survival from COVID–19 can be complicated by pre-existing chronic conditions, especially those that result in diminished lung capacity, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) or asthma. These medical conditions do not cause COVID–19, but can increase the risk of contracting a respiratory infection and death, so these conditions should be reported in Part II and not in Part I. When determining whether COVID–19 played a role in the cause of death, follow the CDC clinical criteria for evaluating a person under investigation for COVID–19 and, where possible, conduct appropriate laboratory testing using guidance provided by CDC or local health authorities. More information on CDC recommendations for reporting, testing, and specimen collection, including postmortem testing, is available from: https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-nCoV/hcp/clinical-criteria.html and https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/guidance-postmortem-specimens.html. It is important to remember that death certificate reporting may not meet mandatory reporting requirements for reportable diseases; contact the local health department regarding regulations specific to the jurisdiction. In cases where a definite diagnosis of COVID–19 cannot be made, but it is suspected or likely (e.g., the circumstances are compelling within a reasonable degree of certainty), it is acceptable to report COVID–19 on a death certificate as “probable” or “presumed.” In these instances, certifiers should use their best clinical judgement in determining if a COVID–19 infection was likely. However, please note that testing for COVID–19 should be conducted whenever possible."

I installed a new receptacle and internet jack for my PC last week. I used to have the power cable run a few feet across the wall to plug it in but I've been able to hide it behind my desk and reorganize the wires, which is a huge OCD thing for me. 

I did yard work today. 

I went to the grocery store two weeks ago. I have to go again tonight. I've been going as little as possible and as late as possible to avoid crowds. This is probably the only time I'll leave my house for the next couple weeks. 

My girlfriend has never seen Star Trek TNG, which was the show I grew up watching so I'm rewatching that with her and thankfully she enjoys it because if not I'd feel bad kicking her out during this pandemic. She loves Data so watching Nemesis should be interesting, especially since I told her he's in the new Picard series but didn't explain the circumstances of his role. 

Other than that I've been modding Skyrim, Splinter Cell: Blacklist (a little bit) and playing World of Warships which is hard to put down. I'm trying to start a new skyrim playthrough soon but my OCD has been standing in the way, urging me to tweak or perfect one more thing before starting. 

I think I can speak for pretty much everyone here though in saying we're really lucky we're computer nerds/geeks/whatever we wanna call ourselves. It does suck being in the house all the time and I'd love to get out and do stuff but at least I have stuff here to keep me entertained. One of my best friends is a super extroverted guy who's always out doing things whether it's going out with ladies, hanging out at friends houses, going out to eat, etc. so he's losing his mind during this situation. Imagine what we would do without our PC's or other games during this isolation, I know I'd have lost my mind of boredom weeks ago. It could be a lot worse. 

Although isolation sucks, it's for the best. Another one of my friends is a nurse who works at a hospital here in Massachusetts and they made her floor the covid-19 ward, so she's as close to the front lines as you can get, dealing with coronavirus patients and risking her own well being almost on a daily basis. The more we can do to prevent hospitals from filling up the better, medical personnel already have plenty to deal with."

Protesting in the midst of this crisis, without posing a big health risk, yet still grabbing attention and occupying the police's time is the only measure we have right now to get our voices heard, as even the lead politician of the anti-Bibi camp, Gantz, bent and split B&W, doing the one thing he promised he would never do - join Bibi's coalition.

I say this because it is a kdrama and has to do with her coming back to life. That part isn’t so realistic, but of course they would bring her back to life with a consequence. Even so, she got a chance, a gift, to be with her family and friends again. The other ghosts so would want that, but Yuri had to go up. She had no other choice. She loved her daughter too much and would sacrifice anything for her even her life. She’s a true mom, and she loves Seo Woo so much. 

Although Gang Hwa and Yuri love each other she died. It’s so sad, but it can happen. Death is inevitable to all of us. 

MJ came and brought them happiness along with the help they needed. It seems Gang Hwa can never love someone as much as he loves Yuri or Seo woo, but I feel he does have feelings for MJ. Seo Woo loves MJ too. MJ filled the mother role they needed. When a father’s wife or husband’s wife dies, they either choose to remarry or not. Most will most likely miss their ex-wife, but one day they must choose to move on to be happy for the both of them. Yuri wanted Gang Hwa to remarry and feel happy. She hated to see him in pain, but I feel MJ helped him get through atleast some of the pain. Their marriage did seems rocky, and they ignored the problems they had. Gang Hwa seems he shielded himself and MJ knew to talk about it but didn’t. They needed to open up with each other, and I wish we saw this. 

But yes it would’ve been great if we saw a alternate universe with everyone happy. It was 16 episodes with many stories within and some lose ties. Then the coronavirus scare. I still respect them. 

I still wouldn’t say it’s a bad ending but maybe unsatisfying. It was still a beautiful story where we saw heartbreak, friendship, love, especially motherly love. 

Death is sad, but we’re not immortal. It hurts and sometimes we don’t know how to cope with it. We can never really move on with who we love because we’ll still be reminded of them. We always wonder what would’ve happened if they didn’t die. It showed us to really love each other and do what we want to do without regrets (unless it’s immorally bad or something) because one day we may not have that anymore. 

Anyway, I may said things that are confusing, sorry. That’s all for my rant. ❤️😊"

You can spook people easily for a little bit, but life goes on, and unless it's in your face people will forget about it.  I know over a dozen people who are out of work due to Coronavirus. I don't know anyone, or anyone who knows anyone, who got sick from it. Millions of people have kids home from school due to this who have never known anyone who got sick from the virus. 

That's why the tide is turning AND accelerating. It's SUPER easy to call something a hoax when everyone known someone impacted by the lockdown yet almost no one in the country knowns anyone impacted by the virus. 

It's really crazy. Over 25 million people out of work, and over 56 million kids home from school. For 35k that have died, 98% seniors with underlying conditions. In no universe are those things equivalent. Every single war we have ever fought has proven the point, people will only tolerate emergencies for a very small time unless the danger is right in thier face."

**Lockdown affairs are on the rise - Meet the people cheating while in isolation**


*Lockdown affairs are very much on the rise. Here's why... and how.*


For most people locked down and working from home with their partners right now, it's hard to imagine getting even a minute's peace. But, contrary to what you'd imagine, people are still managing to cheat on their partners - with cheating sites seeing an increase in users looking for affairs since the pandemic hit. In fact, Illicit Encounters has seen an 18% rise in activity from male members, and a 12% rise from female members in recent weeks.


More than half of these men said they'd initiated new affairs in the last four weeks, with 74% of them citing ""boredom"" as the reason for seeking out new lovers. 46% of female members have made contact with a new partner in that time - with the majority saying the coronavirus crisis had exposed the weakness of their relationship and made them realise they needed ""fresh stimulus"".


We know people are all over virtual dating right now, and considering phone sex and Skype sex to keep their sexual relationships alive. But how do you go about conducting an affair when you're in isolation or quarantining with your partner? What about when they're in the same house as you? Here, two people who are having affairs during lockdown explain why, and how, they're cheating.



*""My lover has been stressed since lockdown - I am his stress-buster,""*

*says Anna, 31*


""I have always had an extremely high sex drive and had slept with more than 100 men by the time I was in my early 20s. When I met my husband though, I decided to change. We got married when I was 24, and the first three years of the marriage were fantastic. I didn't look at another man.


Then, one weekend when he was away, I had sex with a former lover. After that, the genie was out of the bottle. I'd cop off with men on nights out with the girls, and have sex in all sorts of unusual places - parks, church yards, a cemetery. I got caught out by my husband, who said he would give me another chance if I didn't cheat again. I knew that was an impossible ask and we decided to split up.


I was hard-up after the divorce because my husband subsidised my lifestyle, which is how I came to discover Illicit Encounters. A friend was using it to date richer, older men and she said that there were lots of men on the site who were right up my street. She wasn't wrong. 


Before lockdown, I got into a routine of dating two men a month from Illicit Encounters, and seeing them twice a week each. I live in a wealthy commuter town near London, and where there are loads of bored husbands looking for some excitement.


I'm only 31 and still excited by the thrill of the chase, that adrenalin rush you get when you sleep with a new partner for the first time. Until that leaves me - and I am sure I will grow out of it in time - I will still use the site.


I had just started a new affair with a local man in the run-up to lockdown. He is a married entrepreneur. We had sex for the first time at my flat the day before the lockdown was enforced. We knew it was coming and we were determined to have one last hurrah before the restrictions came into place. It was incredibly exciting.


He has been incredibly stressed since the lockdown came into force because he's been forced to close all his businesses, and at present he is struggling to get support from the government. I am his little stress buster.


We FaceTime a couple of times a week and always have remote sex. I will strip off while we both pleasure ourselves. It's fun. If this lockdown goes on any longer, we are definitely going to break the rules because, though remote sex is fun, it is no substitute for the real thing. He has an office at home and finds it easy to contact me without his wife knowing. If he wants some privacy, he can go to one of his closed restaurants which have offices above them.


I have been approached by a couple of other guys on the site during lockdown. We will end up having affairs, but I don't want to cheat on the restaurant owner at present because I know he is having a hard time and needs me. I don't want to kick a man when he is down.""



*""I've broken lockdown to meet my lover,""*

*says William, 44*


""In my 20s I made the mistake of marrying my childhood sweetheart, the first girl I ever slept with. We have three teenagers now and the marriage is still strong. Five years ago, we decided to move out of London and bought a big house in the countryside. It is beautiful, but the commute to work is too much to do every day. For that reason, I started staying in London three times a week.


That's when the affairs started. I've met women at the gym, and have been introduced to other women through friends. But since I joined Illicit Encounters, I began having two affairs on the go at any one time.


Before lockdown, I only ever saw them in London. Since, I have not been too badly affected by the government restrictions. Parts of the City are still operating relatively normally, and my work is busier than ever. I have largely maintained the same work routine as in pre-lockdown days - staying in London three nights a week with long weekends with the family in the Cotswolds.


Have I broken the lockdown? Yes. Once in the early days with a married woman who was marooned on her own in London. But I do believe that social distancing is right and I felt guilty about breaking the rules. I haven't done it since.


I have made two new contacts with women since the lockdown started and we will start affairs as soon as this is over. I have refrained from FaceTime sex with them both during lockdown because I don't want it to detract from the real thing when we are finally free.


Does my wife suspect that I am up to no good? Possibly, though if she does she keeps it to herself. She knows that I use porn and this doesn't bother her. Do I feel guilty about cheating on my wife? Yes, unquestionably. I married too young, without satisfying the sexual curiosity that lies within almost all of us. I Imagine I will grow out of this phase in time, but at present I am having too much fun to want to stop."""

So far, supermarkets have resisted the most draconian policy: banning customers from coming inside.
However, some worker experts, union leaders and small grocery owners believe it has become too dangerous to let customers browse aisles, coming into close range with workers. Grocery stores are still flooded with customers, and experts say it's time for large chains to go ""dark"" to the public and convert to curbside pickup and home delivery for food and other essential goods."

You are absolutely right that Italy and other Western countries are containing Covid-19 far more slowly. Compare with data from China, the main lobe in the death curve is only 1.5 months wide. South Korea's main lobe is even narrower at under one month. In the initial portion of the curve (exponential growth phase), everyone is about the same. But it is the back side of the curve where countries differ. The falling edge tells you how low a country is able to suppress R0 and achieve rapid recovery.

We are arguably heading not for a recession, but a [global *depression*](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/08/coronavirus-putting-world-on-track-for-new-great-depression-says-who).

We can't shelter indefinitely until the creation of a vaccine. We need to find a way to combine considerations of public health (e.g. [new forms of social distancing measures](https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2020/04/green-zones-a-mathematical-proposal-for-how-to-exit-from-the-covid-19-lockdown-ec3ea698f2?fbclid=IwAR1In22LwIA9PHx279RcRFfPZuFYJ1xkIf1MpCFXT40ti7GnzTVug1HOTz4)) while reopening the economy when we think the time is suitable. With the unreliable information we have on the virus it will be tough to predict the optimal time for gradual reopening with stringent social distancing and stringent virus testing. However, countries are going to have to take a plunge sooner or later. Countries that have been *relatively* well prepared (relative to e.g. USA, UK, Spain, etc.) can be more risk-taking. We need this, too. The higher the quantity of data data, the more informed other counties who have been harder hit by the virus can be with their policymaking. 


If we focus on public health exclusively--e.g. create policies such as lockdowns for months on end--the catastrophic economic (and other) factors will have even larger consequences on death counts and quality of life. This is a lose-lose situation for most countries, but some countries have to take strong leadership on dealing with Corona and the economy."

https://www.cdc.gov/flu/about/burden/2018-2019.html

Edit: another point is that these are estimated flu deaths, not reported flu deaths. It takes a while for scientists to sift through the data and try and figure out exactly how many people died, and the reported numbers are always an underestimation. This will be true for coronavirus as well, so comparing reported deaths from a pandemic in progress is not the same as estimated deaths from an outbreak with time for the data to be evaluated."

Our confirmation rate (# positive compared to number tested) has stayed around 33%. We’ve tested about 18,000 people and have had about 6,100 new positive cases both last week and this week.

Our number hospitalized has decreased slightly over the past couple days, which is good news, but isn’t necessarily a sign this is over or even slowing down. The daily fluctuations are very fluid right now.

It’s been 5 weeks since restaurants and schools closed, and 4 weeks since the limiting of groups to 5 people. When these both happened we had under 1,000 positive cases in CT. The fact that we’re increasing steadily is good news since it means on average each person infected is only infecting about 1 other. Without the social distancing each person would have likely infected many, many others, and we’d see a sharp upward curve instead of the flat slope.

I am going to stop giving the daily percentages, since we have more data it’s more important now to focus on the weekly totals than worry about the day-to-day changes. Also, since the numbers are increasing pretty steadily, I may not post every day, although I’ll try to remember since some people find it helpful. However if anyone else wants to post, please feel free. You can find the daily totals at https://portal.ct.gov/coronavirus in the blue box that says “test data” there’s a pdf icon. To know when they’re updated, I just follow Governor Lamont’s twitter feed, and the numbers are posted there when the new document goes live.

While it needs a lot more work and I’m skeptical of it as it stands, it does have a base worth in society, and the coronavirus has shown its uses. Andrew Yang helped in normalizing UBI as a political thing which could help in a crisis like this. I am pleased he beat out the odds when people were pushing for him to drop out because he was absorbing oxygen, and then outpolled many of the other candidates.

Are we trying a scenario where there is a mystery additional population that counts as infection numbers to be applied to lower the infection death rate in a population of 3 million?   So perhaps there are 6 million people infected in Guayas in a population of 3 million and the excess deaths are actually closer to .1%?  What kind of math is that?

The CEBM can say what they like, and I would assume they are saying it based off of tested deaths and not raw burial numbers compared over the past 50 years of death rates.  Which is a mistake they will rectify as they start processing that data which has just come out in the past few days.  Ecuador is waiting on a plane to arrive in May to bring them more tests.

1.  notice fandom-X has toxic fanbase

2.  piss them off

3.  get free press

4.  profit

""some angry gamers"" host ""Muta"" decides to just plain make shit up about Ethan.  Basically he read Ethan's thumbnail, imagined what it was talking about, then attacked that. He accused Ethan of ""donation shaming"" jeff bezos on the basis of $100M being too small a percentage of his net worth.  Then he tried to take credit for ethan/hila donating $100K to a coronavirus fund, and finally in a followup video, donation-shamed Ethan/Hila in exactly the same way that he accused them.  All was made worse when Muta's fanbase brigaded the h3h3productions subreddit with his video over 200 times, and Muta used the deletions to accuse Ethan of censorship and not listening to criticism.  Ethan then made a reasonable video proving all allegations false*.

And now, OP has decided that we must defend Ethan being attacked no matter the veracity of claims.


!*  Caveat: I would not conflate Ethan/Hila raising donations in a fund from other people as the same as ethan/hila donating their own money, which is something Ethan does in his response video. to ""raise funds"" and to ""donate"" are different actions.


More specifics: Muta read the words ""why is jeff bezos not doing more to help?""  and thought Ethan was talking about Jeff Bezos donating ""only $100M,"" and that it's bad b/c it's a small fraction of Bezos's net worth.  Muta assumes that a personal, direct donation could be the _only_ thing such a question could refer to.  But in actual fact, on the podcast Ethan talked about bezos helping his own workers. he calls out bezos for not providing the needed sick days, whole foods asking employees to donate sick days to each other rather than just letting people go home sick and not firing them like reasonable people, things like that.  Also, the podcast episode actually happened 15 days before Bezos made that donation, so the accusation is literally impossible. to pit the maggot bomb on the turd cake, he also doxxed ethan's address.

Even during ethan's response video, he manages to be a misogynist by unironically using ""SIMP,"" though.  all in all rich youtubers are assholes."

An increasing amount of social scientific research has looked at the role of public message framing, for instance, but few studies have thus far examined the role of individual differences in emotional and personality-based variables in predicting virus-mitigating behaviors. In this study we recruited a large international community sample (N = 324) to complete measures of self-perceived risk of contracting COVID-19, fear of the virus, moral foundations, political orientation, and behavior change in response to the pandemic. Consistently, the only predictor of positive behavior change (e.g., social distancing, improved hand hygiene) was fear of COVID-19, with no effect of politically- relevant variables.”

The vibe here has definitely quickly gone from “fuck anyone who left” to “I’m going insane, should we leave?” and this piece in the NYT today captures the vibe: https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/19/us/coronavirus-moving-city-future.html

It’s dawning on everyone that we’re going to have to spend a year (or more?) in our expensive, small apartments without access to our friends, the park, the beach, restaurants, museums, etc. My boyfriend was born and raised here but even he’s saying if he can’t see his family, what’s the point? And for a lot of people who lose their jobs it just won’t be possible at all to stay here. 

I know ethically it’s uhhh very dubious to leave and risk infecting others, but I think it’s very easy to picture “me stuck in my apartment for two years” and less easy to imagine “infecting and killing that guy at the gas station in the country” and people are going to start using ALL kinds of mental gymnastics to get out of here. I’m not saying it’s right, but it’s definitely going to happen (slash is already happening.)

My boyfriend and I are both now presumably immune so if we’re going to be WFH through the summer we might try to rent a place outside of the city. Then the question is who the hell is going to sublet our apartment mid-pandemic? 

I also think that once things start to “open up” and the benefits of immunity become obvious - especially if we end up with immunity certificates or something similar - young people are going to start deliberately infecting themselves. If you’re going to get sick anyway, and it’s the difference between living freely and having work or being stuck inside without income ... I kind of get it."

I also have hypertension, as well as interstitial cystitis and fibromyalgia. My daughter (an asthmatic) and my granddaughters live with me. We have hotels and vacation homes that have offered us housing if we feel our families are in danger of us bringing this home to them. But! My company CANNOT pay me enough, or do anything else to make it worth me uprooting my life, for an unknown extended amounted of time, to put myself, my health and wellbeing at risk. I can easily do 90% of my job and responsibilities from home, but that has been shot down every time its been brought up. 

Your mom needs to think about her own health and wellbeing and get out. If its about financial and health insurance, its just not worth it. Most states have put safeguards in place and are offering assistance during this pandemic. Plead with her if you have to. Pull the selfish card. Tell her you will be devastated if she becomes ill, or worse, over this crop. Make her understand, however you can, that you need her in your life for many many more years. More than the residents in her facility. You can't replace her in your life but somebody else can do what she does work. That may be a hard pill to swallow, but if she stays safe and in her best health through all of this, there will be plenty (more than I care to actually think about it) of positions that need  to be filled with nursing staff when we finally start to see the other side of this chaos."

Where is this evidence of these countries doing this? I think it's likely that you have no evidence and you're making a completely unsubstantiated assumption.

Yes, there have been some poor-quality and unusable PPE shipped out, but that's not an indicator that *all* of it is. Given the large amounts of PPE required worldwide right now, if the majority of it was defective we'd have heard more about it by now. The issue has largely been that foreign countries have ordered supplies from companies that don't have regulatory approval.

For example, the [Dutch ordered masks from a fucking textiles manufacturer](https://www.rtlnieuws.nl/nieuws/nederland/artikel/5093606/afgekeurde-mondkapjes-bestelling-china-falen-nederland-haastige) who's products are not certified. 

>Our own research by BNR Nieuwsradio now shows that the masks are produced by the Chinese manufacturer Putian Jinli LAISI Clothing Weaving Co. The company would normally make clothing and fabrics, but focused on mouth masks due to the worldwide coronavirus outbreak.

>**Medical certificate**

>In China, medical products receive a certificate from the Chinese government according to BNR. Just as in the Netherlands the Food and Consumer Product Safety Authority checks whether products meet the conditions, there is also strict control in the Asian country.

>In China, hundreds of companies are said to be certified to make medical masks, but the company from which the Netherlands ordered the masks was not. Experts, who have experience with the Chinese market, therefore call the purchase 'very questionable'.

Spain is the same story, the [tests from Shenzhen Bioeasy](https://www.euractiv.com/section/coronavirus/news/spain-returns-faulty-test-kits-to-china-as-covid-19-death-toll-passes-4000-mark/) were not approved, and Shenzhen Bioeasy aren't licensed to sell it. 

>“The Chinese ministry of commerce offered Spain a list of certified providers, which did not include Shenzhen Bioeasy Biotechnology. Shenzhen Bioeasy Biotechnology has not yet been licensed by the Chinese National Medical Products Administration to sell its products,” he said. 

Now, you might argue that China should more thoroughly control the exports of medical equipment and take responsibility, which is [exactly what they did](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-china-masks/china-imposes-more-checks-on-mask-exports-to-ensure-quality-control-idUSKCN21S141). 

>using potentially defective equipment is not leading by science.

Asian countries might be more receptive because they might actually be following the guidelines offered by the Chinese government."

""Q9: My employee has children who are affected by school closures or attendance restrictions. What should I do?

In the case of employees whose children cannot attend school or daycare due to a closure or because of attendance restrictions in relation to the coronavirus situation: 

* Employees are responsible for attempting to make alternative care arrangements; 
* If that is not possible, employees should discuss whether telework is a possible solution with their manager;
* If that is not possible, they will be granted “other leave with pay” (code 699).

The above provisions for disruption of school and daycare operations related to the coronavirus will remain available to employees and managers for the duration of the disruption in the respective jurisdictions but will be reassessed by the employer on April 10, 2020.""

Just as a note, I am not aware of any update since April 10th.

So in your communications with your manager, feel free to refer to the document. While it is aimed at managers, I think anyone with a GCCollab account can see it if they do a bit of research, hence why I am sharing this information here."

2020-04-19,IkkunKomi,coolguides,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/coolguides/comments/g46pjr/be_careful/fnx37y9/,"Thank you very much for putting in words what I have tried for ages to do. I understand your struggle and I hope that your journey with it is going well. I know that there are good days and bad days. And what most people also don't understand is usually a trauma will be the 'light switch' that triggers BPD.


Right now BPD symptoms are flaring up, at least for me, due to Covid-19 and the stress alongside with it. I live in South Dakota and I'm autoimmune. We have some cities with bars, restaurants, and casinos open. But we have some with those closed. It is a patchwork ordance to where you can drive a few minutes or miles out of town, and it makes everything in your city invalid. I also live in one of the surrounding cities by Sioux Falls, home of Smithfield, the largest hotspot in the nation for Coronavirus. The mayor and governor have refused to order a shelter in place for either that city, county, or state. People commute and travel to and from Sioux Falls, as well as truckers who use our state highways and interstates though our city. 


I wasn't trying to be political there, but explaining why for me it is currently stressful. My BPD is the product of a mom who was manipulative, a compulsive liar, and hateful. But she was very well liked. She was only like that to me. My siblings are 16 & 18 years older than me. So I grew up with my nieces and nephews around my age. I grew up with 6 of them, and they range from 3 years apart from the oldest to 13 at the youngest. So for example, When I was about 8, I spent all day cleaning my room. My niece and nephew went in there and tore it up and made a mess. We were all watching TV in the playroom, and my mom came in angry at me and slapped me yelling that I made a huge mess. My niece said that her and my nephew did it. My mom then turned arind and gave them a huge hug and said it was okay and everything was fine. Things like that happened all the time throughout my childhood. That is what started to lay the foundation for my BPD.

When I was 16, I had an abusive boyfriend. Both physically and emotionally. My dad had to have a heart procedure about 200 miles away. My mom went with him. I don't want to get into the details of it too much, but my mom had a brain aneurysm during my dad's procedure. When we got to the ICU waiting room, it was my sister's family with her kids and husband, my other sister's family with her kids and husband, my mom's sisters and their families, and well... me. I was alone during this pretty awful time. My dad was in recovery for surgery, and after roaming around the hospital for a bit, I went to the front desk and they let me sleep in my dad's room. Now, both of my parents did survive. The abusive boyfriend had to have a restraining order x2 on him, and he made my life hell by turning everyone against me while I was tending to my family. So, what I am trying to say here is, this is my 'light switch.'


If you wanted to skip all the personal experience shit, BPD is basically a result of trauma from past experiences. With Covid-19, my worry is that those who had those traumatic experiences and are waiting for those 'light switches' to enter a full blown state will happen, but since unemployment is so high, they will not be able to afford to seek care due to lack of insurance. Also, there is the genetic predisposition to mental illness where the 'light switch' can be flipped too.


Trauma brings out a lot of BPD symptoms that I usually have under control mostly thanks to DBT. But it is hard to be able to use DBT sometimes right now because it does take a lot of mental fortitude and power to focus. Trauma in general also is going to affect a lot of people during this time. It's going to affect doctors, nurses, delivery drivers, truck drivers, warehouse worker, grocery store workers, or anyone who is working under less than ideal conditions disproportionately. Alongside anyone who will suffer a loss of a loved one. 


That said (if anyone is still reading, which I hope because this is the main point), **there is absolutely no shame in getting help.** Everyone is going to need some help at some point or another in their life. It could be during the period of the loss of a loved I e or a job, could be during a time of addiction, could be during a realization that you don't feel like yourself anymore, it could be for anything. There is no shame in it at all. 25% of Americans (Sorry I usually like to do global figures, but it was hard to find) have a mental illness. 60% seek help with a therapist, even without a mental illness. Seeking help with a therapist, even if it is online or any other non-verbal commutation, can keep your mental health in good shape.


During Covid-19 and everything with it, stress, anxiety, depression, and all that stuff is normal and will happen. This will be a traumatic experience for some, which is awful. Please do not feel shame if you need to get mental health care. Mental health is just as important as physical health. People don't judge each other over the flu or fibromyalgia. The same goes for mental health care. 


NAMI (National Alliance on Mental Illness) has some great resources to get started:


https://www.nami.org/Support-Education/NAMI-HelpLine/Top-HelpLine-Resources


If you need help, reach out to them. They can hopefully provide you with the guidance of how to set up care and provide you with resources to improve and maintain your mental health via outside treatment.


This is a hard time for everyone. Taking care of your health is the most important thing you can do right now. That includes your mental health. Please take time and make sure to you are doing both. Stay safe and be well."

Brazil has more cases of the new coronavirus than any other country in Latin America. On Sunday, confirmed cases rose to 38,654 with 2,462 deaths. 

Bolsonaro, who was not wearing a face mask, addressed a crowd of a few hundred in Brasilia, many of them wearing Brazil’s yellow-and-green soccer jersey. 

His brief address, which was punctuated by the president coughing, touched on talking points that have become his usual rallying cry. 

He called those in attendance “patriots” and said they were helping defend individual freedoms that he said are under threat by lockdowns imposed by authorities at the state level."

My life has been ruined because of your stupid attempt of making me laugh. I stopped breathing when you made that joke so I would not ever laugh at anything you say again. I didn't laugh no one will ever laugh at your joke and I am so confused regarding the situation you have put me and other people of the human race into. I am shocked and others will be shocked at your comedy. I didn't laugh and you should not have a right to even utter anything with a tiny touch of sarcasm. Unbelievable.

Scientists spend a lot of time trying to determine which flu viruses will be most prevalent each year, prepare the corresponding vaccine mix and try their damnedest to get people to get the vaccine. Plus people have likely been exposed to those viruses so people have some level of natural immunity to them.

With the novel coronavirus, we don't have a vaccine. Nobody has a built up immunity. So the only thing we can do is to try to avoid catching it, either until there's a vaccine or (since we obviously can't completely avoid it) people have been exposed and their immune systems make the antibodies to combat the virus. The lockdown is really so that those exposures happen in a more controlled manner so hospitals can keep up. If everyone got exposed in a short period of time, those who might live with intervention end up dying because hospitals can't accommodate.

I'll admit that the original numbers were likely inflated, not because we were being lied to, but because we just weren't noticing a lot of the mild cases. As we've learned that a lot of cases don't even show symptoms, the calculated fatality rate has dropped."

With Arizona and other states considering reopening their economies on May 1, health experts said the state isn't yet doing enough COVID-19 testing or collecting good enough data to responsibly lift stay-at-home orders.

You can do a pedigree search at [https://pawpeds.com/db/?p=mco](https://pawpeds.com/db/?p=mco) It's helpful to see which Maine Coon catteries come up when searching pedigrees. Not completely up-to-date but a good resource to learn about catteries.

If you're on Facebook, join the group [BLACKLIST Breeders Cats / Cattery Cats](https://www.facebook.com/groups/BlackListCats/?ref=group_header) , not just for Maine Coons. You can search by cattery name in the group's search bar and see if a breeder you're considering comes up in it.

When this coronavirus is over, search TICA and CFA for cat shows near you. You can talk to a lot of breeders at the shows. Some breeder websites will tell you what to look for and how to avoid scams.

One of our breeders, Megacoon in North Carolina, sent this out in his April monthly newsletter. The scammer site listed in his newsletter has pirated photos of Megacoon's cats. I checked it and it's true.

Megacoon April 2020 Newsletter

I was contacted recently regarding a lady who was scammed while attempting to buy a Maine Coon kitten. She wanted to alert me that (the opening photo of Riley-Red Classic-white male on my website) was being used on the fake site. Well, not only did they steal many photos, they stole the whole design and the theme and wording of the Megacoon Web Site. About the only thing they did not steal, was the cattery logo.

The fake site is [www.ratimainecoon.site](http://www.ratimainecoon.site/). My web site designer is pursuing  copyright infringement through the proper channels and we hope to get the site pulled. I have always heard imitation is like flattery. But this website stuff is ridiculous. Needless to say I am not pleased  that someone is basically using my site design to scam kitten buyers out of their money.

**Question of the Month!**  
**How do I recognize a fake cattery website.** I have addressed this item in a previous newsletter about a year ago. But under the circumstances that have occurred, I thought it would be a good time to re-address this subject. Scammers have become quite accomplished in setting up fake sites and with the exploding popularity of Maine Coon Cats there are unfortunately lots of fake sites out there.

Photos shown on fake sites are usually of older show quality kittens and they may be posted at lower than normal prices but not always. Almost always shipping is involved. Usually once a deposit has been paid, the scammer will hit you for a travel or shipping fee. You can ship a cat almost anywhere in the USA for about $400 or less unless the airlines have drastically increased their prices. Watch out for super high shipping costs.

Once they get the shipping they add insurance costs. They will just keep adding additional costs as they drain as much money as possible from you. Many people actually lose thousands of dollars before they get suspicious.

What can you do? First: all certified, registered cat breeders will have a registered cattery number and cattery name, regardless which cattery registry it is. CFA, TICA, ACFA. There are 6 cat registries in the USA. Once you get the cattery number you may double check with the registry. If they will not give you the number, you may still check out the name with the registry. If its not listed, it is a fake site.

If you cannot get a real person on the phone that is a red flag. Most fake sites will only deal with money gram which is difficult to trace or also bit coin. I personally do not take credit cards, but if a site only deals with money gram that is another red flag.

if you have been scammed, contact in writing, the state attorney generals office in the state the fake site is located in. also contact your local sheriffs  office.

I hope this info will help reduce the number of people getting ripped off by the scammers. Lastly, do not get in a big rush to buy a kitten. Take your time and do your research. If it sounds like it is to good of a deal to be real. Most likely its not real.

One last item. If you have questions concerning, pricing, kitten availability, cattery location, breed information, etc. Please visit the website. ([www.megacoon.com](https://megacoon.us15.list-manage.com/track/click?u=5f542381ed1647252f410f726&id=2c25893de0&e=69850c6f65)). It will answer 99% of your questions.

Conservative activists are demanding governors lift orders designed to stop the spread of the coronavirus, despite the recommendations of public health officials. Trump, who has clashed with Democratic governors over how soon to reopen the US economy, tweeted his support on Friday, in an unprecedented endorsement of civil disobedience by a sitting president.

Many of the planned rallies have been inspired by a protest at the Michigan state capitol on Wednesday, which was attended by thousands.

Armed protesters demand an end to Michigan's coronavirus lockdown orders – video
Yet while organisers claim the protests are grassroots- and people-driven, a closer look reveals a movement driven by traditional rightwing groups, including one funded by the family of Trump’s education secretary, Betsy DeVos.

The rallies have drawn comparisons to the Tea Party movement, which sprang into life in 2009 following the election of Barack Obama and was driven in part by Americans for Prosperity, a group founded by rightwing donors Charles and David Koch.

As with the Tea Party, the anti-stay-at-home movement has been promoted by a rightwing media eager for the economy to reopen, including Fox News which on Friday aired a segment on protests in Virginia, Michigan and Minnesota. Two minutes later, Trump tweeted to his 77.4 million followers the need to “liberate” those states.

'They seem very responsible to me': Trump defends anti-lockdown protesters - video
A majority of Americans support the lockdowns, with a Pew Research Center poll finding that 66% are concerned state governments will lift restrictions on public activity too quickly. But protests, helped by media coverage, have spread around the country.

The two groups behind the “operation gridlock” rally in Michigan on Wednesday have ties to the Republican party and the Trump administration.

The Michigan Freedom Fund, which said it was a co-host of the rally, has received more than $500,000 from the DeVos family, regular donors to rightwing groups.

The other host, the Michigan Conservative Coalition, was founded by Matt Maddock, now a Republican member of the state house of representatives. The MCC also operates under the name Michigan Trump Republicans, and in January held an event featuring several members of the Trump campaign.

“Absolutely the Michigan event was a huge inspiration and it was a huge success,” said Evie Harris, organizer of a ReOpen Maryland protest planned for the state capitol on Saturday.

“That was the model for our event.”

Thousands drove to the Michigan state capitol in Lansing, while the Michigan Freedom Fund purchased Facebook advertising to promote the rally. Protesters, many waving Trump campaign signs, honked their horns and chanted for Governor Gretchen Whitmer to end the stay-at-home rules.

The protest was covered exhaustively by the rightwing media. Harris said her Facebook following grew from “700-800 people” to more than 15,000 members following the Michigan rally, inspiring her to organize “Operation Gridlock Annapolis” for Saturday.

Harris said her group had support from some elected officials in Maryland, but declined to name them.

While ReOpen Maryland might not have funding from rightwing advocacy groups, it appears to be linked to at least four other “reopen” organizations.

“Government mandating sick people to stay home is called quarantine,” ReOpen Maryland said. “However, the government mandating healthy citizens to stay home, forcing businesses and churches to close is called tyranny.”

That text is identical to text on Facebook pages calling for rallies in Wisconsin, Pennsylvania and Virginia. ReOpen Virginia aims to hold its own “gridlock” rally on Wednesday – again inspired by the conservative-funded Michigan event.

Despite ReOpen Virginia billing itself as a “grassroots group of people and small business owners”, founder Kristen Lynne Hall said the idea for the protest came from the organizers of the “Lobby Day” demonstration earlier this year.

That demonstration was organized by the Virginia Citizens Defense League, a gun rights group that has donated tens of thousands of dollars to politicians.

Hall, who said Candace Owens, a rightwing activist and favorite of Trump, had been in touch to discuss the event, said the president’s tweet about “liberating” Virginia was “great”.

“It could be spreading the movement,” she said. “Any support is appreciated right now.”

A decade ago, the Tea Party movement billed itself as “grass roots”, despite receiving money from the Koch-backed Americans for Prosperity and the conservative organization FreedomWorks.

Jenny Beth Martin, who founded the Tea Party Patriots group, promoted this week’s Michigan protest. The Tea Party Patriots also supported the protest, in messages to its 200,000 Twitter followers.

Matthew Gertz, a senior fellow at Media Matters for America, a progressive media watchdog, said the similarities between the Tea Party and ReOpen movements went further, with rightwing media boosting both.

Fox News ran favorable coverage of the Michigan rally and hosts including Laura Ingraham and Jeanine Pirro endorsed the protest.

“Fox gave the Tea Party a phenomenal amount of attention and promotion,” Gertz said. “It really sort of boot-strapped it to another level, and made it a political force, and we see something similar happening with these anti-stay-at-home order movements.”

Gertz said he was not “simply” concerned with “the conservatives having a strong election the next time out”.

“It’s a real chance for devastating consequences with regard to the coronavirus,” he said."

We've been genetically modifying virus for a while, it's been used well in many gene therapies and has been used in vaccines. I've participated in this type of work, we experimented with bacteriophagic viruses to defend against biological warfare agents directed at agriculture. Synthetic viruses aren't new either. 

Even de novo synthetic viruses will always contain elements found in other viruses that have been known to produce the desired effect and most are build with heavy inspiration from other viruses. Even the most unique and original ones. The thing is, the novel coronavirus has elements that are completely new to us. 

Those elements were found to boost it's infectivity - if China wanted to make a new highly infective virus, they would very carefully choose elements that have previously been known to produce that effect, not completely new elements that haven't been seen in human viruses before. This excludes how there are ridiculous levels of controls in every country that would all of had to been bypassed to intentionally obtain these elements, and it would be impossible to be done completely within China"""

I have learned a few new things about him. He gets pretty protective of food, and has snapped at the family dog about 3-4 times now, but that seems to have gotten better too. 

I’m hoping once I can pick up the training sessions again I can learn more about reading his distress signs and work with him to have him more controllable on walks. That’s the biggest stress right now since I live in an apartment complex."

Flu vaccines have been in production since World War II  and it seems the human risks and side-effects from the vaccine are a known quanitity and the manufacturing processes and equipment are decades old ,now. So ,for pharmacetical companies. producing a safe vaccine for a different strain of annual common flu is achievable, relatively cheaply and quickly.

A Coronavirus vaccine ,in contrast, will be a new thing , whose safety and efficacy is unknown.  So the vaccine will have to go through animal trials, all the phases or the human trials and novel manufacturing techniques and technologies might have to be developed to scale up the production of the vaccine.

Let's see how this turns out."

I think we need more open discussion about this, and free from people so entrenched in their position that they feel the need to belittle anyone trying to bring up new/alternative viewpoints to their own. Maybe the article you referenced might change some opinions, maybe it won’t, but at the very least I think it highlights just how much we still don’t know about the novel coronavirus, how prevalent it is, and how deadly it is.

I know the lynch mob came after Dr. Drew for his comments, some of which he’s already walked back, but let’s see how this all plays out before we start vilifying people for their opinions on the topic. Even if it turns out he underestimated the threat posed by the novel coronavirus, we might still discover that he was hovering closer to the target of reality than many other more dire prediction models. 

I get it, stay home, don’t take unnecessary risks, contain the treat as much as we can for the time being. But I think declaring anyone who so much as suggests that perhaps the threat posed by the novel coronavirus isn’t as dire as many in the media have declared is potentially as dangerous as underestimating the threat in the first place. There’s a tangible cost to shutting down society, the economy, and routine medical procedures to the extent that we have so far. And maybe it will turn it that it was all warranted and necessary. But in the meantime I fully support pushing out all the data we can to try to figure out what we’re dealing with, whether or not it confirms to previous viewpoints and data on the issue."

Every media outlet in the country--NYT, WaPo, NPR, Vox, Vice, NBC, you name it--was referring to it as ""The Wuhan Coronavirus"" right up until Pooh said how that hurts his feewings, and within a week referencing China in relation to CV became ""racist"".

* CNN (Left): The social-distancing deniers have arrived

CNN didn’t even try to be professional, just incite their followers

In another example:

* Fox News (Right): Trump fires Michael Atkinson, intelligence IG who told Congress about Ukraine phone call
* AP (Center): Trump fires watchdog who handled Ukraine complaint
* CNN (Left): Trump fires intelligence community watchdog who told Congress about whistleblower complaint that led to impeachment

Fox News didn’t even try to be professional and incited their readers with that title, including putting the official in danger from crazies

But, the company IS still exploitative in many ways. Last month, when employees had to move their desktops home, they had to fill physical forms with details of their desktops and stand in queues in multiple departments to get the forms stamped and signed. Hundreds of employees had to queue up in tight spaces, where people coughed and sneezed in really close vicinity. This was all done to prevent Coronavirus. They had 4 months of time to digitize a simple solution, but they didn't.

Talking about bonuses and increments, there is a rating system, which is completely biased. Many employees who have stayed on bench for extended periods have got better appraisals than those who have worked their asses off in projects. In projects too, there are bell-curve systems because of which, somebody definitely has to get good appraisals and somebody bad irrespective of their work performance. There have even been times, when ratings were given to employees by managers who never even worked with them or knew about their work."

2020-04-19,threearmsman,WhitePeopleTwitter,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/WhitePeopleTwitter/comments/g3xmim/spot_on/fnurgjc/,"Firstly, there is absolutely no uniform medical consensus on how dangerous or not dangerous the virus is. We have swung wildly from a 4% death rate to as low as [.1%](https://www.sfgate.com/news/editorspicks/article/Santa-Clara-antibody-test-coronavirus-results-case-15208216.php). With that in mind, since we don't know how dangerous it is, it should absolutely be taken care of with the utmost precaution until we do know more about it. That is to say that I support social distancing and self-quarantining wholeheartedly. But that takes me to your question.



>What is that angle?


People will always seek more power. This is nearly a universal truth. The same applies to governments and the people within those governments. If there is ever an opportunity for the government to accrue more power unto itself, it will take it. While not the only instance, one of the best examples from recent memory is the Patriot Act. We became very scared and the government used that to take our right to privacy away from us. Both political parties have had the opportunity to get rid of these ""emergency"" powers and both have resoundingly decided to keep them in place. Without force or extreme political shakeup, that is most likely a right we will never have again. 


So let's turn to look at what exactly government mandated social distancing is; it is stating that in no uncertain terms, if the government deems things bad enough, they have the ability to suspend your right to assembly. And while this is all good and well for while we are fighting ~~terrorists~~ Coronavirus, we always need to analyze every application of a law, not just the ideal scenario it is proposed for. Should there be political protests and mass unrest, what is to stop the government from suspending your right to assemble and brutalizing all who disobey? After all, it's for your own safety that we quell these protesters. You wouldn't want them hurting innocents, would you? 


I do not believe that these restrictions are going to last after the pandemic but I absolutely believe they will work as a lasting framework for the next ""emergency"" that your government wants you under house arrest and unable to organize for."

A sign tells someone that there is a cliff. Is that sign threatening them?

Warnings and rules to steer from danger are not threats.

However, you see hell the way Catholicism has painted it. God just wants you to be tortured and die for eternity. That is wrong! Catholics have polluted the scriptures to control their people.

If you truly want to know what hell is, I can perhaps explain it? If you wish.

My mom got sick (not coronavirus) and this has given me a chance to spend more time with her now than I have been able to for the last 13 years. Today is her birthday and my siblings all pitched in to make this one of the best birthdays she's had in a while - even if a few of my siblings had to socially distance as they have families of their own and didn't want to add any more risk to my already high-risk parents.

On a personal note, I started remote therapy last week and feel like continuing this might bring a little help to my mental health. I'm going to keep working to make as much of a positive impact on those around me and keep trying to work on myself to come out of this stronger than ever.

2020-04-19,LastYouNeekUserName,newzealand,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/newzealand/comments/g35qnq/we_are_nailing_it/fnuvnds/,"I mean sure, HIV isn't COVID-19.  Friendisok could have instead used a different virus as an example, for instance by pointing out that we have never created a vaccine against a coronavirus, but you thought that comparison was irrelevant as well.

Certainly Friendisok was a little ignorant of the current state of HIV treatment which really is *all but* a cure, but that misunderstanding has been cleared up now.

You've just given me a list of viruses that we've successfully created vaccines against, but what you haven't provided is how long it took to develop these vaccines.  The question isn't so much ""is it possible to create a vaccine ever"" (though perhaps that is still a useful question), but more about how long it will take.

I guess what I see in this whole rambling thread is:

a.  Concern that we might not have a COVID-19 vaccine in 12 months.

b. Concern about what we do if a. turns out to be true.

Your response has been largely to push the idea that we are likely to have a vaccine soon, and you make some good points re: the amount of resourcing, the enormous incentives at play, etc.

The problem I have with your responses is that you are very quick to downplay any counterpoint, some of which at least *appear* to be pretty reasonable e.g.

a. We've known about coronaviruses for a long time, but have not yet successfully vaccinated against any of them.

b. We know that some viruses are not easy to vaccinate against -> HIV

Sometimes you offer a little explanation of why such concerns aren't really valid, but more often you respond with a flippant claim that any comparison is completely irrelevant.

Another thing you do is try and shut down the debate by claiming that we're spreading misinformation.  I am not here to broadcast a message to the public that the lockdown is a waste of time, and I doubt Friendsisok is trying to do this either.  We're simply having a conversation, that thing you do when you want to try and understand a situation.  Inevitably through ignorance or misunderstanding people will say things that turn out to be incorrect, and it is right to point these inaccuracies when they are said, but then telling everyone that they have no right to a conversation because they are not an expert in xyz is wrong.

You appear to have a background in microbiology and politics.  If you mentioned that the weather was nice where you were, would you expect me to tell you to stop spreading misinformation and that you should leave a discussion of the weather to people who have studied meteorology?

Before graduation, did you ever have conversations about microbiology with your lecturers or fellow students?  Or did you wait until you were fully qualified before discussing any such topic?  I very much doubt the later, because discussion and debate are part of the learning process.

I'm also going to point out that I am FULLY in support of the government's actions so far.  I think the lockdown is working great, and wouldn't want this country taking any other approach.  I haven't mentioned my position on this so far, because it *ought* to be completely irrelevant to the discussion at hand, but perhaps knowing my stance might help you understand me?"

My bpd parent is my mom. We recently discovered that my dad had a surprise child. My parents have been split for ages, this isn’t a story about my mom. Dad and I have had an incredibly strained relationship, especially after my parents split. I’m sure you can picture the ways my mom talked about him, warped my mind, and I grew to hate him, for real and imagined reasons. In the last 10 years, the relationship has improved, but it’s still awkward and a bit distant. So now that I’ve got a new sister, I am struggling to describe my childhood to her, my relationship to dad, all of it. I’ve glossed over a lot, but did make it really clear that life was far from perfect with him, we went 5 years without talking, I still resent him a bunch of stuff. But I didn’t go into detail. I told her that when we meet in person (thanks coronavirus), I’ll fill her in on the details. 

However, she met dad—online—before me, so she’s already formed her own opinions about him. My new sis didn’t want specific details about dad and my childhood, so it’s not hard to pick and choose stories. She wanted his background, how and where she grew up, what his life was like, and a bit about me now. She’s 50, I’m 40, it wasn’t a lot of childhood tales. And seriously, the first few FaceTimes were all about what we look like. 

I wouldn’t resist reaching out to your sister just because of your bpd parent. You will get to that level of detail for awhile. I’ve been talking to my new sister for a month now, and she doesn’t even know about the stuff he does to me every time we talk now, say nothing of the crap he pulled when I was young."

If no one around you is sick, and you have been practicing social distancing just monitor your symptoms for a week and see if you are feeling better day by day. Try to meditate and do yoga to calm yourself down too. If you start getting different symptoms even after you’ve tried calming yourself down, try to get yourself tested for covid.

Talking to media during his daily White House briefing on the coronavirus outbreak, Mr Trump said that America wants to be open and that a national shutdown is not a sustainable long-term solution.
Asserting that a prolonged lockdown, combined with a forced economic depression, would inflict an immense and wide-ranging toll on public health, Mr Trump told reporters that his administration is issuing new federal guidelines that will allow governors to take a phased approach to reopening their individual states.
For the first phase, the guidelines recommends that states see a downward trajectory for 14 days in the number of confirmed coronavirus cases before they move to lift stay-at-home orders and other restrictions. The second phase includes asking for all vulnerable individuals to shelter in place, encourage telework, closure of common areas and physical distancing.
The third phase is essentially returning to the new normal with better hygiene practices, and respect for spaces between individuals."

my response:

are we splitting hairs over the definition of the word airborne?

i am copy/pasting an article where dr fauci personally describes airborne.. it sure sounds like mr fauci is describing the coronavirus as being airborne:

The nation’s top infectious disease expert said recently published research that suggests the coronavirus can travel 27 feet and linger airborne for hours is “terribly misleading.”

“I’m sorry, but I was disturbed by that report because that’s misleading,” Dr. Anthony Fauci, a member of the White House task force, said Tuesday of jarring headlines stemming from
MIT associate professor Lydia Bourouiba’s research.

Bourouiba, whose research on the dynamics of coughs and sneezes was published in the Journal of the American Medical Association, warns that current social-distancing guidelines to stay 6 feet apart are inadequate and outdated.

The scientist writes that “pathogen-bearing droplets of all sizes can travel 23 to 27 feet.”

But Fauci noted during a Tuesday White House press briefing that it would take a “very, very robust, vigorous, achoo sneeze” for droplets to even come close to traveling such a distance.

Enlarge ImageDr. Anthony Fauci

The esteemed doctor even feigned a forceful sneeze on stage as an example of what it would take to propel the droplets that far.

“So if you go way back and go, achoo,” said Fauci as he leaned back, then thrust forward, “and go like that, you might get 27 feet.”

He added: “That’s not practical. That is not practical.”

Bourouiba fears that the current guidelines are “overly simplified” and “may limit the effectiveness of the proposed interventions” against the deadly pandemic."

* The managers would underpay everyone


* We never got payed overtime and we had to work long shifts.


* One time we ran out of mayo so the mamagers told everyone to jizz on the burgers until the delivery came in.


* An employee was caught stealing food and the managers came in and ripped his stomach open and extracted all the biproducts from his digestive tract and served it 10% off.


* A kid came in to order a big mac and he didn't pay so Ronald McDonald came in and hooked the kid and beat him up yelling ""Not gonna steal now huh?"" while dragged him to the playground and moaning was heard echoing throughout the slide.


* A elderly man walked in with KFC so the entire McDonalds was gassed with an airborne strain of the coronavirus to avoid the spread of KFC.


* A burger once fell on the floor and the manager said ""it's already contaminated"" so he took a fat shit on the burger and the whole staff team used it as a toilet until it was finally served out. 


* A man used a coupon code so the person taking his order slammed the mans head 340x on the wall.


* One day, the burger patties ran out, so we played cat and mouse and grabbed all the mice from the restaurant and chopped them up and squished them to a patty size. We threw them in the broiler and made rat patties for the customers."

I'm not really sure at what time I wake up with this new pattern, since my only uninterrupted sleep comes after I've slept for only 3-4 hours the previous night. Therefore I guess sleep longer because the body is catching up on sleep. When my sleep wasn't interrupted I slept for 12 hours but I think I would have slept even more if I didn't force myself to finally get up.

But even with my previous pattern (at going to bed at 2am) I would sleep really long hours, that's another problem of mine. I wouldn't sleep for less than 10 hours if I wanted to feel fully rested. I don't know why it's like that. The strange thing is that if I went to bed at around 5-6 am, I'd sleep less and I'd be up at around 1-2 pm. 

I'm not sure what medication to use for good quality of sleep. I've tried a bunch of stuff (but no prescribed medicine) and I haven't felt much of an evident effect. I feel like 20mg of melatonin helped me fall asleep but even with that I barely felt much difference. I've also tried 5-HTP, L-Theanine, Kava Kava, Magnesium, various B Vitamins. And even if sometimes they help me fall asleep they don't do much for keeping me asleep :/   
I do plan on seeing a doctor to see what they'd recommend, but as I've said I want the situation with the coronavirus to settle down a bit first. 

But in the end what would you personally recommend when I get up during the middle of the night - wait for a few hours and then go back to bed or go through the whole day on little sleep in order to get to my usual bedtime?"

>Has he strengthened your economy in ways that haven't been reported in our press?
For the first three years of his presidency, we did see the stock market grow. It's my belief though that most of that was false growth. We've seen how wild the markets are. Moreso, there really hasn't been notable wage growth for most employees, and the tax cuts allowed for money to remain in the extremely wealthy. So in general, any economic growth has been mostly falsified, in my opinion, especially as *22 million* Americans have filed for unemployment in the last 4 weeks. Beyond the economy, though, he has actually divided the nation, on nationalistic, political, and racial grounds. At the very least, he's broadened the nation's gap further. So my view is that he's been horrific for both the US, which leads to another user. As u/nager2012 noted, he does have a great influence on the rest of the world. And in any other case, I would agree - his damage in the US does weaken our standing in and with other countries. However, I'm trying to see how it's so prevalent in this case, where coronavirus is seeming to almost cause an ""every country for themselves"" reaction. It was just a curious note. I do think he's bollixed it up royally, and is going to kill thousands of people (low balling it) from his ego."

This is the real problem we are facing. Those people are protesting because they’ve been brainwashed to think that the other side is hurting them, rather than the virus. 


>	what universe are you living in where making it temporarily illegal to blatantly ignore safety protocols is going to lead to tyranny?

A universe in which I’ve watched politicians grab more and more power in a country that is supposedly against tyrants. Just look at the encryption bill that was recently talked about. Or you can go a bit further back and look at the patriot act. Anytime the government says they want you to do something for “safety” there should always be a pause. 

I am 100% science based in my decisions. Coronavirus is a clear and present threat to this country and social distancing is the best thing we can do right now. 

I just don’t like the idea of people calling for jail on these protestors. It’s scary how easy it is for people to want to jail those who they don’t agree with. Protesting social distancing is stupid. The people who think COVID isn’t real or comes from 5G are fucking idiots, but I still want to protect their rights to be fucking idiots. It’s what this country was founded on.

No time like the present to start, though I'd suggest that you start with some easier things. Some of the easiest mitzvos are the most important.

> Is there any advice on looking into diving more into the faith?  

Yes! Judaism is transmitted from person to person (parent to child/teacher to student) and it's not easy to learn about it on your own, so I'd suggest that you get a [Partner in Torah](https://partnersintorah.org) (as someone else already suggested). You get to choose your partner based on their bios, and you'll learn together with them over the phone or Zoom or whatever. I happen to be on the teaching end of a partnership. You can pm me for more info if you want.

You can read up on Jewish topics on sites like [chabad.org](https://chabad.org) and [aish.com](https://aish.com) (as well as [ohr.edu](https://ohr.edu) and [simpletoremember.com](https://simpletoremember.com)). [Aish Academy](https://academy.aish.com) has made their courses free due to coronavirus.

Post-quarantine, you can get yourself to Shabbat meals via [shabbat.com](https://shabbat.com), which I think among other things also doubles as a dating app and has some interesting content.

If you're college age, look into Birthright, which offers free trips to Israel to anyone Jewish between the ages of 18 and 32 who hasn't been to Israel as part of an organized program. Here's a [link](https://www.israelfreespirit.com/trip/) to a Birthright provider's website."

There's no way the ruling elites of every country will be fooled by such flimsy accusations. More than anyone, they know how badly the coronavirus was handled by almost every country, including themselves. Just look at one metric: how many days did it take for each country, once the virus reached them, to recognise it as a serious threat and institute strong measures? Then take into account that China had to grapple with more unknowns. China's early response, while not good, was by no means some incredible outlier in being poor. Lack of regulation of bushmeat is the only valid criticism imo. 

But it's also no surprise at all that the Western world would rally against China. What's the sentiment in places like Africa, the Middle East and Eastern Europe? I'm not sure, but anecdotally I can say that the information and perception war is going very, very strong outside of the West, with no clear winner yet."

2. Masks are useless against protecting you against the virus, but you may have to wear one because it can save lives, but they may not work, but they may be mandatory, but maybe not.

3. Shops are closed except those shops that are open.

4. You must not go to work but you can get another job and go to work.

5. You should not go to the Doctor's or to the hospital unless you have to go there, unless you are too poorly to go there.

6. This virus can kill people, but don't be scared of it. It can only kill those people who are vulnerable or those people who are not vulnerable. It's possible to contain and control it, sometimes, except that sometimes it actually leads to a global disaster.

7. Gloves won't help but they can still help so wear them sometimes, or not.

8. STAY HOME but it's important to go out.

9. There is no shortage of groceries in the supermarkets, but there are many things missing. Sometimes you won't need loo rolls but you should buy some just in case you need some.

10. The virus has no effect on children except those children it affects.

11. Animals are not affected but there was a cat that tested positive in Belgium in February when no one had been tested, plus a few tigers here and there...

12. Stay 2 meters away from Tigers (see point 11)

13. You will have many symptoms if you get the virus, but you can also get symptoms without getting the virus, get the virus without having any symptoms or be contagious without having symptoms, or be non contagious with symptoms ... it's a sorta lucky/unlucky dip.

14. To help protect yourself you should eat well and excersise, but eat whatever you have on hand as it's better not to go to the shops, unless you need toilet roll or a fence panel. 

15. It's important to get fresh air but don't go to parks but go for a walk. But don't sit down, except if you are old, but not for too long or if you are pregnant or if you're nit old or pregnant but need to sit down. If you do sit down don't eat your picnic, unless you've had a long walk, which you sre/aren't allowed to do if you're old or pregnant.

16. Don't visit old people but you have to take care of old people and bring them food and medication.

17. If you are sick you can go out when you are better but anyone else in your household can't go out when you are better unless they need to go out. 

18. You can get restaurant food delivered to the house. These deliveries are safe. But groceries you bring back to your house have to be decontaminated for 3 hours including frozen pizza. 

19. You can't see your older mother or grandmother, but they can take a taxi and meet an older taxi driver.

20. You are safe if you maintain the safe social distance when out but  you can't go out with friends or strangers at the safe social distance.

21. The virus remains active on different surfaces for two hours ... or four hours... or six hours... I mean days, not hours. But it needs a damp environment. Or a cold environment that is warm and dry... in the air, as lokg as the air is not plastic.

22. Schools are closed so you need to home educate your children, unless you can send them to school because you're not at home. If you are at home you can home educate your children using various portals and virtual classrooms, unless you have poor internet, or more then one child and only one computer, or you are working from home. Baking cakes can be considered maths, science or art. If you are home educating you can include household chores with their education. If you are home educating you can start drinking at 10am.

23. If you are not home educating children your can also start drinking at 10am.

24. The number of corona related deaths will be announced daily but we don't know how many people are infected as they are only testing those who are almost dead to find out if that's what they will die of. The people who die of corona aren't counted, or won't, or will be counted but maybe not.

25. We should stay in lockdown until the virus stops infecting people but it will only stop infectig people if we all get infected so it's important we all get infected and some don't get infected.

26. You can join your neighbours for a street party and turn your music up for an outside disco and your neighbours won't call the police. People in another street are allowed to call the police about your music while also having a party which you are allowed to call the police about.

27. No business will go down due to Coronavirus except those business who go down due to Coronavirus. 

Hope that makes things clearer for you."

```
For now, the most likely explanation of why people are retesting positive seems to be that the test is picking up remnants of the virus.
The KCDC has re-investigated three cases from the same family where patients tested positive after recovering, Kwon says. In each of these cases, scientists tried to incubate the virus but weren't able to -- that told them there was no live virus present.

I also think they have and are doing a great job.

However, I think that I read a Stuff article that referred to the PM getting a heads up from her friends overseas that helped lead to the decision to lockdown. If I am wrong, I apologize.

It has also been reported that an amateur epidemiologist operating their own website from the US learned about the coronavirus through Chinese-language SNS messages in December. 

I am a nobody living in Asia, and it seemed that I had better information, faster than my friends in the NZ government. Perhaps, they knew, but due to confidentiality couldn’t let on. It’s possible. 

Information is no longer limited to government. Also, regular folks are becoming a part of the solution, something the government may not have anticipated. People using 3D printers to print parts for medical equipment, for example.

Healthy debate and discussion amongst people about what is going on around them is not a bad thing. In some countries, this type of discussion could get you detained.

2020-04-19,tomzadi,PoliticalHumor,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalHumor/comments/g3rafp/history_of_the_conservative_movement_in_two_images/fnutcwq/,"> Well I’m sorry I would gladly give up a right or two for a few months to protect the economy and the safety of the American people. 

First, that’s the most asinine drivel anyone could cough up. Under no circumstances should the state **ever** possess the ability to remove someone of their rights.

Next, that’s not how it works. In order to alter, let alone suspend, the Constitution, which no sane individual ever wants, Congress would have to engage in this magical thing called “due process” and reach a 66% majority vote in both houses in order to pass such a  measure. If you haven’t noticed at this point, all stay-at-home orders are in direct violation of the constitution — not even did the individual states engage in due process. Executive orders are the antithesis of due process, and in this case, none of them are enforceable, let alone legal. Lawsuits have already been brought up against states for the impositions they’ve cause, and they’ve all won.

Now, you may feel that it’s right or morally sound to eschew your rights in order to “save the American people” or whatever, and that’s fine. This isn’t *1984*, and the thought police doesn’t exist. You can think whatever the holy fuck you like. Hell, you can feebly meander into your local PD or courthouse and beg the inhabitants to treat you like some statist slave and impose the will of the state on you, waving some bullshit waiver of rights you printed off of Google at them, if that’s what gets you off — they’ll probably horse laugh at you for being so pathetic and tell you to get the fuck out, but hey, at least you tried. However, what you **cannot** do is sign over the rights of every single American just because *you* think it’s right and *you* are willing to give yours up.

Additionally, allowing the state to believe they can suppress rights is an extremely dangerous activity to engage in, in itself. Telling the state that there are circumstances under which it can relieve citizens of their rights gives it the means to determine which circumstances a person should have rights, whether it’s right or wrong. Are you really willing to put that much trust in a government that has exhibited, on numerous occasions, the desire and the will to abuse and oppress humans? If so, more power to you. But it’s not going to happen.

> Would you rather have the coronavirus running rampant through America until there is a vaccine? Or would you rather just have a couple of shit months and then a faster recovery? 

I would rather Americans have the right to choose for themselves how they respond. It’d be great if they participated in social distancing, but absolutely not at the behest of the state.

> It’s obviously better in the long run to restrict the people temporarily

It’s actually not. As I’ve already said, giving the state the power to determine what circumstances constitute an acceptable time for people to exercise their basic freedoms is far more dangerous in the long run than the virus. 

> Is a few months of hanging out in groups really worth that much damage to our country? 

Bruh, I’m choosing to stay home, and I hope everyone else is, too. At this point in the discussion, I would hope it was apparent that I think social distancing is a good idea — god knows how many times I’ve had to say it now.

What is **not** a good idea is allowing the state to place restrictions on basic rights, under **any** circumstances.

> Do you really want to doom America for this idealistic principle? 

You’re pathetic. Rights are not an idealistic principle. Aside from the bag of bones containing your physical existence, rights are the only thing you are inherently born with. Reducing them to an “”iDeALisTiC pRiNciPLe”” serves no other purpose than to exhibit exactly how little you value your own existence.

Have fun living in your police state when/if this is over. I hope, for my sake and that of those who don’t embody the pathetic ideology of a statist, that you never get it."
