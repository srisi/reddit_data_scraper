On a creaking telephone line from Lagos, Nigeria, Owolabi Oludare Peter pauses. Owolabi is Odion Ighalo’s lawyer and one of the trustees for the orphanage home founded by Manchester United’s new striker.

Owalabi says: “To understand Odion, we have to go back to our childhood together and you, and your readers, will need to use your imagination. Imagine the world you know, all of those comforts in England and the world you grew up in. Then, I want you to think of the opposite. Because, my brother, in our village; it was basically a ghetto in Ajegunle. We did not have amenities, lights or electricity. clean water was not a guarantee. There was a lot of poverty. The only similarity between then and now for Ighalo? He was donning a United jersey as a child and now he does the same in Manchester.”

As the clock ticked down on the final evening of the transfer window, Ighalo became the stop-gap solution to Manchester United’s striking problems. Signed on loan from Chinese club Shanghai Shenhua, after United had previously failed in concerted attempts to sign Erling Haaland and Joshua King, it was not most supporters’ ideal way to close January. The bear-baiting was not helped by manager Neil Warnock revealing that the 30-year-old Ighalo was an option for Cardiff City in recent times while Aston Villa also baulked more recently at the financials of any deal.

Yet, behind the scenes, manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer is quietly satisfied. Ighalo was the top scorer at the 2019 Africa Cup of Nations and he has notched 31 goals since playing in China.

There are obvious question marks over whether a player from the Chinese Super League can readjust swiftly to the rigours of Premier League football. Quique Sanchez Flores, who coached Ighalo both in China and at Watford, warns: “Mainly, the problem is how they train in China. It is not the same as in England. Is he really ready for first-team matches in the Premier League because the physical difference is so big? He probably needs one month to recover the full rhythm. The good thing is he knows his body well, works hard on injury prevention and he is always working after training. I should say, also, that I felt in China, he gave exactly the same effort and quality as he gave me four years ago. We had the feeling in China that he could recover a high level with any team in Europe.”

In the past 12 months, Barcelona made an attempt to sign the player on loan, while several sources have confirmed to The Athletic that Tottenham Hotspur’s interest in Ighalo was genuine. Jose Mourinho wanted a striker to deputise for the injured Harry Kane but chairman Daniel Levy was unable to strike a deal. His agent Atta Aneke tells The Athletic: “For me, officially, there was another concrete offer from a team in the Premier League. It would not be fair for me to mention who he turned down.”

Ultimately, two key factors secured the deal for United. The first is that Ighalo genuinely appears to be a boyhood United supporter. A close friend, Antonio Ruizal, says: “It was, really, always his dream. I know everyone says that in football but it is true. I was so excited for him I barely slept on Friday night. In China, he would be in his home watching United games, as well as those of his former team Watford. I remember when he was at Watford, one day we went to a restaurant and he told me Louis van Gaal wanted to sign him. This was in January 2016. It did not happen in the end, as Van Gaal left and then Jose Mourinho came and it all went away.”

Mourinho instead signed Zlatan Ibrahimovic for United but roles were reversed on deadline as Ighalo was this time the man calling the shots. United’s position was aided not only by Ighalo’s preferences but also their financial clout. The Athletic has learned that Ighalo’s annual salary in China is around €7 million “net” and United will be covering the vast majority until the end of the season, through a combination of a loan fee paid to the Chinese club and a weekly contribution to his wage package. Tottenham’s financial offer did not match the one on offer from Old Trafford.

Solskjaer, whose side have now failed to score in three consecutive Premier League games in the absence of Marcus Rashford, simply required a striker and Ighalo may prove shrewd business. The player due to land in Manchester on early Sunday afternoon, two days after the window closed, and the transfer was scrambled over the line with such haste that United were not able to complete their own medical while Solskjaer himself did not hold talks with the Nigerian striker.

His agent Aneke explains: “The deal was done through agents. I’m sure he’ll speak to Ole when he arrives. They are quite thorough in the medical department at a big club like Shanghai. I believe they’ve sent all medical reports to United and done the required testing they can do.” United later confirmed Ighalo was not required to do a medical due to it being a loan move.

On deadline day, the transfer was by no means guaranteed. “I spoke to Ighalo at around 9.40pm on Friday night and it still was not completely done,” says his friend Ruizal.

United first made significant contact on Tuesday but despite Ighalo looking at flights on Thursday, the deal appeared to be off as the club considered other targets. United’s attempts were further complicated by the outbreak of the coronavirus in China and United needed to establish whether Ighalo had travelled to areas considered high-risk during his Chinese club’s pre-season. Then, as time ebbed away, United formalised an approach. Aneke says: “It was only midday yesterday [Friday] when I became truly convinced it could happen.”

As China is eight hours ahead of the UK, Ighalo stayed up through the night. “He was delighted,” Aneke says. “I think it was a shock but he is delighted. It all happened so fast. He was there in his home, in the middle of night doing paperwork. He was overwhelmed.” Ighalo, wearing a mask to protect his face from coronavirus at Beijing airport, then flew to England to join up with his new team-mates.

Back home in Nigeria, there was jubilation, and even a signing party in his village on Sunday to celebrate the move. One close family member said: “Growing up in one of the most dangerous and unfriendly neighbourhood in the streets of Ajegunle was really tough. It was dangerous. You have pickpockets roaming around in the hood, no security; it is a ‘ghetto’ setting. But he has changed our lives through God’s grace and hard work.”"

A day after New York City’s health authorities said that a woman was hospitalized with [the city’s first suspected case of the new coronavirus](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/01/nyregion/coronavirus-new-york-city.html), the authorities on Sunday announced that two more patients also might have the virus.

Samples from all three patients must first be tested at a laboratory in Atlanta that is run by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to determine whether any of the patients do in fact have the new coronavirus.

The turnaround time for receiving the results is usually at least 36 hours, but often longer. Local health departments are not yet able to test for the new illness themselves.

But based on a number of factors — the type of symptoms; the patients’ recent travel in China; and the exclusion of influenza and some other common illnesses through testing — the New York City health authorities are taking quite seriously the possibility that these patients may have the virus."

A man was detained after beating up a doctor in Wuhan, and medical staff members are wearing raincoats to protect against infection.


WUHAN, China — One week into a lockdown, anger and anxiety deepened in China on Thursday as the central province at the center of the coronavirus outbreak endured shortages of hospital beds, medical supplies and doctors.

In a sign of growing frustration, a relative of a patient infected with the virus beat up a doctor at a hospital in Wuhan, the capital of Hubei Province, the state broadcaster CCTV reported on Thursday, citing the police. The man was accused of pulling and damaging the doctor’s mask and protective clothing — potentially exposing him to the virus — after his father-in-law died in the hospital. The man was later detained.

At the same time, hospitals in the region renewed pleas to the public for help to replenish their supplies, which were fast disappearing. The shortages have become especially severe in Huanggang, a city of seven million not far from Wuhan, where some medical staff members were wearing raincoats and garbage bags as shoe covers to protect against infection, according to Yicai, a financial news site.

Amid growing unease, the World Health Organization declared a global health emergency,  which acknowledges that the disease now represents a risk beyond China. Nations can then decide whether to shut their borders, cancel flights or screen people arriving at ports of entry. Late Thursday, the State Department urged Americans not to travel to China, issuing a Level 4 advisory, which represents the highest safety risk.
Also Thursday, Chinese government agencies announced plans to issue subsidies of up to $43 per day to front-line medical workers and to reopen factories to boost production of medical supplies and protective gear.

“We absolutely cannot let Huanggang become a second Wuhan,” Wang Xiaodong, the governor of Hubei Province, said at a news briefing on Wednesday.

On Thursday evening, provincial leaders said at a news briefing that the director of Huanggang’s health committee had been fired.
For many Chinese, such decisive government announcements are too little, too late. Concerns have grown as the death toll from the coronavirus has quickly ticked upward, rising by 43 to hit 213 on Friday. All but one of those recent deaths have occurred in Hubei Province; the other died in the southwestern province of Sichuan.

Fueling the anger on Thursday was the publication this week of a new paper about the coronavirus in The New England Journal of Medicine by a team of researchers affiliated with, among other places, the Chinese Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Hubei Provincial Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

Drawing on data from the first 425 confirmed cases in Wuhan, the paper states that “there is evidence that human-to-human transmission has occurred among close contacts since the middle of December 2019.”

Chinese people online were incensed, asking why the government had waited until Jan. 20 to inform the public that the virus was capable of being transmitted from human to human. By Thursday evening, many had seized on the paper as evidence that the authors had purposely withheld valuable information out of academic self-interest.

“I’m about to explode, I need an explanation from the authors!!!!” Wang Liming, a professor at Zhejiang University, wrote in a widely shared social media post that was quickly deleted. “As a researcher with firsthand information, you knew that the virus could be transmitted between humans three weeks before the public did. Did you do what you were supposed to do?”

As China raced to contain the outbreak, countries grappled with how to evacuate their citizens from Wuhan and how to stop the virus from spreading.
Australia announced a plan to evacuate its citizens in Wuhan to Christmas Island, which has played an important but checkered role in the country’s contentious use of faraway sites to house refugees and other migrants. The announcement drew immediate questions over the implications of using the island as a quarantine site.

Moving people to Christmas Island is not an “appropriate solution,” Dr. Tony Bartone, the president of the Australian Medical Association, said in a television news interview. He said the government had other, more suitable facilities, such as military sites.

In Japan, a furor erupted over the refusal of some evacuees who had returned to submit to medical testing.

Two of the Japanese citizens who have been evacuated from Wuhan refused to be tested for the coronavirus, leading the prime minister to explain that citizens could not be forced to submit to a medical examination.

Japanese social media users said the travelers, who arrived in Tokyo on Wednesday, were putting the country at risk. Some called them terrorists.

“We tried to persuade the two returnees from Wuhan for many hours” to be tested, Prime Minister Shinzo Abe said in Parliament on Thursday, when asked about the government’s treatment of repatriated citizens. “But there is no legally binding force, and that’s a great regret.” Mr. Abe said.
Russia ordered 16 of its approximately 25 crossing points on its 2,600-mile border Chinese border to be closed as of midnight local time as fears about the coronavirus outbreak mounted in Moscow.

“We have to do everything to protect our people,” Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin said on Thursday in televised remarks at a cabinet meeting.

Italy blocked thousands of people from leaving a cruise ship that docked there on Thursday over concerns that someone aboard might have the virus. Although a Chinese national with a fever later tested negative for the coronavirus and the Italian authorities said passengers were allowed to disembark, for much of the day the country was gripped by fears that the coronavirus had arrived on its shores.

That concern proved warranted later Thursday, when the government reported the country’s first two confirmed cases, neither of which were related to the ship.

Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte also announced that Italy had halted all flights to and from China.

In the United States, health officials on Thursday reported the first case of person-to-person transmission of the coronavirus in the United States. The patient is the husband of a woman who was the first reported case in Chicago, officials said at a news briefing. The woman, who is in her 60s, had returned from Wuhan.

The American commerce secretary, Wilbur Ross, said the United States could see a positive byproduct from China’s woes because the outbreak could prompt employers to move jobs to its shores.
“I don’t want to talk about a victory lap over a very unfortunate, very malignant disease,” Mr. Ross said in an interview on Fox Business. “I think it will help to accelerate the return of jobs to North America. Some to the U.S., probably some to Mexico as well.”

His remarks may be seen as insensitive to a country in crisis, and he has faced such criticism in the past. During the government shutdown in early 2019, Mr. Ross suggested that furloughed workers should take out loans while they went without pay for more than a month.

With the evacuations and lockdown, Wuhan, a typically bustling metropolis, has been transformed into a ghost town. Since the city was effectively sealed off last week, most shops have shut down. The city government has put restrictions on traffic. The lack of transportation options has made it difficult for medical workers and sick residents to get to hospitals.

But most residents of Wuhan  are not leaving their homes because they are too scared of catching the virus.

“Local Wuhan residents who aren’t worried about being sick aren’t even going on the streets,” Chen Qiushi, a Beijing-based lawyer who has been in Wuhan since the lockdown began, said in a video blog posted on Thursday. “The locals are all very scared.”

When Wuhan residents step outside, it’s mostly to go to the supermarkets, food stores and pharmacies that stay open as part of a government effort to sustain the city. Senior officials have promised that residents need not worry about vegetables, fruit or other staples.
While Wuhan residents have been able to buy food, some complained about price increases or expressed fear that a prolonged shutdown might choke off food supplies. And if the shutdown lasts weeks longer, with the rest of China also scrambling to secure food supplies, it could make things more serious, several residents said.

“If we can’t bring in produce, it will become more expensive, or we might even have to close up,” said Zuo Qichao, who was selling piles of cucumbers, turnips and tomatoes. As he spoke, a woman accused him of unfairly raising the turnips’ price.

“Every county, every village around here is now putting up barriers, worried about that disease,” Mr. Zuo said. “Even if the government says it wants food guaranteed, it won’t be easy — all those road checks.”"

Viruses usually mutated into one which is more suitable to infect their host target. Any virus who didn't mutate to do so will go extinct.

Since the viruses need to mutate into something which could infect the host better than their relatives, there will be evolutionary pressure for the virus to exploit any exploit or feature of their target. Since the target of the current virus are Chinese population when it jumped from whatever animals who are the virus reservoir, of course, the virus will be one who could exploit certain features of the target population, which in the case of the Chinese population is their ACE-2 receptor polymorphism through the Coronavirus S-Protein.

I mean, if the SARS CoV also evolved to infect the Chinese better then it won't be strange if the nCoV did the same too.

A similar story happened to the measles virus. When it evolved from Rinderpest, it jumped from cattle to humans, and from evolutionary pressure and large new population to infect, measles finally evolved into something that only infects humans and can't infect cattle anymore 

Of course, it's easier to say that the virus is bioengineered to kill Chinese people rather than accepting that due to the evolutionary process and natural selection for the nCoV to better infect their target host population, it mainly infects Chinese better than random human.

> For a healthy 35 year old man to need oxygen + antiviral doses, doesn't look like this is something that can be toughen out at home and cure itself. Can /r/indonesia MD/microbiologist here add their take on this ?

It all depends on virus replication. If there is a severe viremia (high virus load in the blood) compounded with severe systemic inflammatory response syndrome with a bacterial opportunistic superinfection, then yes you could die. The same with the influenza virus. For some people, they could just brush it as something trivial, but for ten thousands people who died from influenza every year, yeah it's deadly. Measles too, as long as you don't get bacterial superinfection pneumonia or meningitis, you will stay alive. For the ten thousands infants who has the bad luck of getting those superinfections in their post measles period, well, too bad.

EDIT: After I visited the site... There is a preprint on every submitted paper:

“bioRxiv is receiving many new papers on coronavirus 2019-nCoV. A reminder: these are preliminary reports that have not been peer-reviewed. They should not be regarded as conclusive, guide clinical practice/health-related behavior, or be reported in news media as established information”

Just visit the https://twitter.com/JohnRInglis the coFounder of bioRxiv.

EDIT2: Just realized... For laypeople, I must stressed that the site bioRxiv IS NOT a proper journal. it's more a preprint paper so people could then comment the paper.

WEIRD: Why is the Chinese government making a *military base* out of the hospital they just built?

WEIRD: How is it possible for the officials to have had 10 day plan to build a hospital in the first place? With the exact land already planned out?

WEIRD: If the numbers were correct then there was absolutely no need to build another hospital the first 2 days it hit the news. Unless they already knew beforehand how bad this virus was?

With China's history of disregarding the lives of their citizens - how farfetched would it be to suspect they were creating an undetectable biohazard virus and using their citizens as guinea pigs to test out all the possible cure? 

If that's the case where we have a virus that's, for the most part, undetectable and can be transmitted so easily without having physical contact - how deadly of a war weapon is this?

And how much power would the country who first discover the cure would have over the rest of the world? 

For that to happen it's almost like they would need massive amount of people infected with the virus to quickly try out different methods to find a cure... Someone please tell me I'm overthinking this.

2020-02-03,stackofblin,worldnews,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/exrfdw/explosives_found_at_train_station_on_hong_kongs/fget7tr/,"> Hong Kong police called the bomb squad to a railway station at the border with mainland China on Sunday afternoon, when two explosive devices were found on a train.
The police force called the incident part of an ongoing bombing campaign and said the city was “one big step closer to terrorism” carried out by extreme, violent individuals.
Lo Wu MTR station, which links to a border checkpoint between the city and Shenzhen, was closed for several hours, and rail services affected. The border checkpoint is one of the busiest in the world.
One of the devices was defused, while another caught fire and spurted white smoke, though it was unclear whether it had been detonated. No one was hurt.
Police said officers were called in when a cleaner spotted a plastic bag under a seat on a train, which arrived at a platform at about 3.10pm. The cleaner moved the bag to the platform, where another employee examined it and saw wires inside.
When police arrived, they cordoned off the site and called in the explosive ordnance disposal bureau.
Alick McWhirter, a senior bomb disposal officer, said the bombs were viable. One of them partially functioned, while officers defused the other.
“Over the past days, weeks and months, Hong Kong has been faced with an ongoing bombing campaign,” he said, adding that powerful home-made bombs were “designed to kill and injure innocent people”.
A video released by police showed the semi-functioning bomb catching fire and giving off smoke. The power and nature of the explosives had yet to be analysed.
Police said one user of online platform Telegram had claimed responsibility for planting the bombs, and expressed anger at the Hong Kong government’s refusal to fully close the border, amid fears over the spread of the deadly coronavirus.
The user threatened mainlanders by saying they should consider their personal safety when visiting Hong Kong and that “planting bombs was easy” no matter how good police deployment was.
Earlier, protesters had promised a “dawn of anti-epidemic” action if the government did not heed calls for border action against the virus, which began in the mainland province of Hubei.
Superintendent Po Chun-kuen of the organised crime and triad bureau said: “These home-made bombs were used as weapons by terrorists abroad … the case is very serious. You can imagine if it exploded in a concealed, running train. People nearby might get hurt, the smoke also could cause serious harm to a lot of people.”
Po said the substances used in the latest incident, the fourth of its kind in recent months, would be studied to see if the case was related to previous ones.
“Police strongly condemn these extreme, violent individuals, what they have done is like one big step closer to terrorism,” he said.
“Police strongly condemn these extreme, violent individuals, what they have done is like one big step closer to terrorism,” he said.
It was the second time in a week that East Rail line services were disrupted. Early on January 29, a flaming object was thrown onto the tracks near University station by protesters, while some other items were also found in Fanling and Sheung Shui.
Hong Kong has been roiled by more than seven months of civil unrest, sparked by the now-withdrawn extradition bill. The campaign has morphed into a wider anti-government movement, fuelled by anti-mainland sentiment. Amid the Wuhan virus crisis, protesters have used it as justification to stem the influx of mainlanders into the city."

There are many cases not diagnosed, and the bar to entry to the hospital is quite high—people have to line up for days to get tested, and wait for their community committee to help them get tested and a place in the hospital. 

Reportedly there are many sick people who die but have not been tested because of the backlog, so they are not counted towards the mortality rate. Of course there may be mild cases out there as well which are not tested.

Regarding your statements about the severity of the illness however, there are a couple important points: 
1. Several doctors have gotten sick, including the opthalmologist who was one of the first to raise the alarm on Chinese social media. Wang Guangfa, a specialist sent by the central government, was infected by the disease  (https://amp.scmp.com/news/china/article/3047394/chinese-expert-who-came-down-wuhan-coronavirus-after-saying-it-was).

That, and like someone else said: even if this all blows over in the next week and it's nothing, they're still going to want to have plenty of kits on hand for people testing to see if they have symptoms/the coronavirus, rather than dusting their hands off and being like ""And the world is now at peace, completely and utterly. All doctors get the rest of the year off!""

Also, on top of that, it's always better to overproduce (within reason) than to underproduce. They needed kits really bad early on, had none, so this seems like a response to that shortage.

Just 4 days later on Jan 10, a first genome was released on Virological.org only to be followed by five more the following day via GISAID.org. From very early on, it was clear that the nCoV genomes lacked the expected genetic diversity that would occur with repeated zoonotic events from a diverse animal reservoir. 

The simplest parsimonious explanation for this observation was that there was a single zoonotic spillover event into the human population in Wuhan between mid-Nov and mid-Dec and sustained human-to-human transmission from this point.

 However, at first it was a struggle to reconcile this lack of genetic diversity with WHO reports of ""limited human-to-human"" transmission. 

The conclusion of sustained human-to-human spread became difficult to ignore on Jan 17 when nCoV genomes from the two Thai travel cases that reported no market exposure showed the same limited genetic diversity. 

This genomic data represented one of the first and strongest indications of sustained epidemic spread. As this became clear , Mr. Virologist spent the week of Jan 20 alerting every public health official that he knows."

The only good side is that this seems to be a way of thinking that is limited to older members of society, and that younger people have a clearer way of thinking when it comes to pets.

Just went through the shownotes and found this:

Wuhan from Intel Analyst   

From a well placed source with direct ties to mainland
China, here are some facts regarding the virus. He really got into minutiae of
genetic medicine and health risks and traits based on very specific genes and
gene sequences. Naturally, when the Coronavirus hit he went to work
researching genetics and papers on the disease. He attended Johns Hopkins
a Univ in Nanjing China for his MA, and as alum still has a logon to their
libraries, where he drew much of his research from.
The short version:
>- Those most susceptible to nCoV the highest ACE2 gene structures.   

>- People who contract nCoV never recover from it. The virus becomes
recessive after incubation and initial flare. Many of those who had an
initial infection with fever and cough, but without Cytokine storm, had showed
a compromised immune system and recurrence of the virus.   

>- In several cases the third or fourth recurrence, in the reduced immune
response, the Cytokine storm developed. Those people died.   

>- Because the virus is immuno-compromising, any recurrences further weakens the
immune system. The Chinese are using the term “Airborne AIDS” in describing the
approach to it.   

>- The patient in Seattle who was given an experimental anti-Retroviral after
his first post infection flare, fully recovered on the drug. He was
declared cured. When he stopped the drug, the virus flare recurred
([described in January 22nd NYT article\)](http://archive.is/XW2ry). He’s back in the hospital.      

>- 70% of the infected are male.

>The basic prevention is to quarantine and avoid people in
the ACE2 gene sequence, as shown below. Those people will have the
highest viral load and be “super spreaders”.   

>Yes, this is much less deadly currently than the flu virus,
however it has the potential to grow undetected and at a much higher rate. It
also has already had an impact on the global economy that has already surpassed
anything the flu virus has ever done.

If you listen to the podcast, he also mentions that this virus ostensibly affects certain genotypes more, namely Han Chinese due to lung makeup.

È più facile spiegarlo con un esempio: ho la sequenza di una proteina del capside di nCoV. Questa proteina potrebbe avere 200 amminoacidi. Immagina una sequenza di 200 caratteri, con un dizionario di 20 lettere. BLAST *non* compara tutti i 200 caratteri in una volta, ma suddivide in piccole porzioni, facciamo triplette, questo ""testo"" (ABCDEF diventerebbe così ABC, BCD, CDE, DEF), cercandole poi di allineare *in maniera esatta* nel database - ad esempio - di tutti i Coronavirus conosciuti. Nel momento in cui l'algoritmo trova una tripletta identica, quel punto diventa il ""seed"" dal quale parte una ricerca anteriore e posteriore lungo quel testo. Se le lettere prima/dopo coincidono di un certo grado (il livello di score S che tu imposti, cioè la significatività) quella proteina è uno degli output.  

Tra gli output trovi tutte quelle proteine con uno score >S. Potresti trovare una proteina del capside della SARS che ha un 80% di match in sequenza, traendo varie conclusioni come la genealogia dei due virus, che tipo di mutazioni ha subito in quel 20% di mismatch, e così via."

There’s also r/financialindependence 

More on investing, you need $5,000 minimum to use Vanguard, and I’d recommend looking into it because if you’re just throwing your money into a bank account, sure, it gets interest, but inflation is higher than the interest rate, and although your numbers can go up over time, your numbers will be worth less.

When investing, invest in many areas, not just on, otherwise you fall into the category of putting all your eggs in one basket, meaning if this investment fails, you lose everything. Distributing risk across many different investments lowers your overall risk, because although some can fail, you won’t lost everything.

Also, when investing, invest in something you have done your research on. As in, pull up historical data and see if this is right for you, and learn how national events and global events connect to your investments. One example of the correlation to events is that stocks have been dropping globally due to the Coronavirus spreading throughout China and being called a global health emergency.

Its sometimes smart to evolve some infective/severe symptoms like skin lesions from the get-go. Then the entire game evolving symptoms and resistances and once you get Greenland and Caribbean, victory is practically guaranteed. Severity increases human attention, but the DNA snowball effect far outweighs the downside. The cure doesn’t matter because you infect and kill the world way too fast.

I replied above to another comment but you're talking about a country with 1.4 billion people.

To test every single person in China just ONCE you would need produce kits at this rate for 5 years straight. 

If China is having anywhere near as bad of a regular influenza season as the US is, they'd be looking at tens of millions of flu cases per month. Nevermind actual coronavirus infections.

Initial patients probably get tested twice as well. So really, they need to increase production to over 1.4mil just to cover the negative cases. 

You can obviously pare down who you test and again- focus only the most ill, but still, 773k per day is not that much."

You can look out for your safety in better ways, for example, properly informing yourself. I don't think judging all Chinese or assuming all Chinese are diseased with the coronavirus is a healthy way (especially mentally) of looking out for your safety.

2020-02-03,-ZeuS--,China_Flu,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/China_Flu/comments/ey4qcu/people_desperate_for_treatment_started_descending/fgf3xma/,"Article:


From Amy Qin, a China correspondent, and Elsie Chen, a researcher, on the ground in Wuhan:

People desperate for treatment started descending on a new hospital in Wuhan on Monday that was built in just 10 days after the outbreak of the new coronavirus. But with workers still trying to finish construction on it for Monday’s opening, many were turned away.

Multiple road checkpoints had been set up to screen cars heading to the hospital. A sign at one checkpoint said: “Huoshenshan Hospital does not have an outpatient facility. Only diagnosed patients transferred from other hospitals can be admitted.” Officers at the checkpoint were telling the sickly arrivals and their relatives to instead call 120, China’s emergency number.

One man named Xue Ying was driving toward the hospital with his cousin, who had recently been tested for the coronavirus but had not yet received the results.

Mr. Xue believes his mother died from the coronavirus, but they could not secure a bed in a hospital and she was never tested for it. His aunt and uncle were also in a hospital. He said he was desperate to find help for his cousin.

“I can’t afford to lose anyone else,” he said, sitting dejectedly in the car with his sick cousin.

About 1,400 military medics will begin working at the new hospital, which covers roughly 365,000 square feet and has been fitted with 1,000 beds. A second facility in Wuhan, with 1,500 beds, is expected to be completed this week.

From Amy Qin, a China correspondent, and Elsie Chen, a researcher, on the ground in Wuhan:

Weak with fever, An Jianhua waited in line for seven hours outside the hospital in the cold, hoping to get tested for the new coronavirus, which doctors suspected she had contracted.
Ms. An, 67, needed an official diagnosis from a hospital to qualify for treatment, but the one she and her son raced to last week had no space, even to test her. The next hospital they were referred to here in Wuhan, the city of 11 million people at the center of the outbreak, was full, too, they said. They finally got an intravenous drip for Ms. An’s fever, but that was all.

Since then, Ms. An has quarantined herself at home. She and her son eat separately, wear masks at home and are constantly disinfecting their apartment. Ms. An’s health is declining rapidly, and even keeping water down is a struggle.

“I can’t let my mom die at home,” said her son, He Jun. “Every day I want to cry, but when I cry there are no tears. There is no hope.”

For some people, like Gan Hanjiang, the city’s new hospitals for treating the coronavirus cannot be built fast enough.

Last month, his father came down with a severe fever and cough. He was tested for the coronavirus, but the results were negative. Ten days after the onset of symptoms, however, his father died, Mr. Gan said.

The hospital classified the cause as “severe pneumonia,” Mr. Gan said, but he believes it was the coronavirus. Several experts have recently conceded that several rounds of testing may be needed for an accurate diagnosis of the virus.

I just have to say, that although I LOVE Nature, & all things scientific, including bats, bats are wild (exotic) animals & are very prone to carrying diseases that are harmful to humans. The current outbreak of the ‘Coronavirus’ in China is thought to have been contracted from wild bats captured & kept in a market, for the purpose of consumption by humans. Viruses easily mutate, & ones that mutate within an animal population & are transmitted to Humans can be extremely devastating to Humans,  HIV was a mutant virus called SIV (Simian Immunodeficiency Virus) present in monkeys in Africa, infecting ~ 37.9 Million people in 2018 & killing 770,000 in 1918 alone.  The 1918 Swine Flu Epidemic killed an estimated 50-Million people; the 2009 Swine Flu Epidemic killed a newly revised estimate of ~284,000.  SARS, also a Corona virus, killed 774 & infected 8098 people, killing ~1 out of every 10 people infected & started in China from a suspected source of small mammals.  There are many more of these types of transmissions.  The ‘Western’ countries, including the USA don’t see as many of these types of cases, of mutated viruses from animals jumping to the human population because of our science/evidence-based practices involving the hunting & handling of wildlife & the veterinary (husbandry) practices handling livestock.  This is why you don’t see live animals for sale in our markets, & only in very special & controlled (supposed to be) situations, do you see meat from wildlife for sale in markets or for consumption in restaurants.  These practices have kept us safe, & although this is a long way of getting around to my point: that the handling of animals, especially wildlife, should be taken with extreme caution by persons appropriately educated about how to handle them, etc., to prevent catastrophe’s like the afore-mentioned cases, from happening again.  This current outbreak of this new(?) Coronavirus can & should’ve been prevented by China, if they would only adopt & enforce Modern wildlife & veterinary practices for the sale & consumption of live animals in markets, especially wild & exotic types, by adopting modern practices of how to handle & consume these animals. (May I also object to China allowing their folk-medicine practices that endanger wild species like Rhinoceros, Elephant, Pangolin, Tigers, etc. - that their gov’t needs to stop the practice of).  The SARS Virus outbreak cost the World Economy $40 Billion over 6 months in 2003.  This new Coronavirus is thought to have been transmitted by live bats in these Chinese markets- therefor, my warning is to let the experts, the honest licensed, working with government wildlife organizations handle these animals- the risk of harm to them (yes, we infect them also), & to us, has very devastating effects to local & global populations!"

The animation shows the (total) number of confirmer infections in Mainland Chinese with the nCoV-2019 and how fits to an exponential and sigmoidal growth function.

TLDR: Do NOT panic, this plot is meant to be beautiful and maybe increase interest and no one should use it to predict the future of humanity. Use the research provided instead. Or maybe look at this [NY Times article](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/world/asia/china-coronavirus-contain.html) for some more facts about the outbreka

DISCLAIMER: To start off, this fit is very complicated and the animation should not be taken as a serious attempt to model the spread of nCoV-2019. The exponential model renders the virus’s growth infinite, while obviously the world’s population is indeed finite and the growth would slow down as the virus reaches its spread limit. Nevertheless I found the fit very compelling but strongly advise everyone not to make “sciency” conclusions based on my fit, because that’s not his purpose. To cite [u/desfirsit](https://www.reddit.com/u/desfirsit/)

>“A turkey that tried to predict the quality of his life the next day on the basis of days so far would always have very strong statistical evidence that the next day would turn out fine - until Christmas. New events don't factor into these simple models.“

Furthermore the sigmoidal fit assumes the virus spread to be restrained by environmental factors and seems to fit the current data more likely. It is based on a simple SI-model only restraining the virus spread by a total number of susceptible individuals. A reference on it can be found  [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compartmental_models_in_epidemiology#The_SIS_model) and also one of the references provided further below.

My tries to illustrate the behaviour of such a prediction model, its adoption to new data points and maybe convey an overall interest on the topic. For real world predictions you may refer to papers linked in two days agos post (e.g. by [u/Agent\_03](https://www.reddit.com/u/Agent_03/)), some of which are:

It is also important to note that my animation depicts the confirmed number of infections. It is therefore questionable, whether you can see that the virus still spreads or whether the simply the amount of confirmed cases increases. Furthermore there have been suggestions that my method of retrieving the error bands is wrong, which I will investigate.

The data is retrieved from Wikipedia, which itself gathers the data from the daily report of Chinas National Health Comission.

Link to the source:

The plots and animations were created using a Python script which can be found on my github

>[https://github.com/tipfom/coronaplotter/blob/master/script.py](https://github.com/tipfom/coronaplotter/blob/master/script.py)

My model used two fits for the data. The first one is an simple exponential y = a \* exp(b \* x) to fit the data (x starts at 16.01. e.g. x=1 for the 17. Jan). An extrapolation of the fit for using the data points available is shown as a blue line. The bluearea shows the certainty in which the actual fit lays within 66% accuracy. For the last day (28.01.) the fit-parameters where

>a = 300+- 50  
b = 0.242 +- 0.011

The second one is a fit to the sigmoidal function y = a / (1 + exp(-b \* (x - c))) shown in orange, which converged to these parameters in the final frame:

>a = (2.59 +- 0.15)e+04  
b = 0.383 +- 0.015  
c = 15.33 +- 0.33

It may have been the species of animal consumed, cross contamination, or inadequate cooking of the meat. It’s not sinophobic to point out the conditions in China that have helped diseases like the Coronavirus and SARS to become zoonotic.

“Early on, many of the patients in the outbreak of respiratory illness caused by 2019-nCov in Wuhan, China had some link to a large seafood and live animal market, suggesting animal-to-person spread. Later, a growing number of patients reportedly did not have exposure to animal markets, indicating person-to-person spread. Chinese officials report that sustained person-to-person spread in the community is occurring in China. Person-to-person spread has been reported outside China, including in the United States and other countries. In addition, cases asymptomatic spread of the virus have been reported.

Comeon dude, at least think about the things you're saying about other people's lives. We have more nukes and F-16s than we know what to do with, surely we can put up a few tents and stuff them with hand soaps for two weeks.


The worse thing about all of this is how inept the response has been at the very top. The govt is too cuccked to evacuate them because of optics and because ""it would umdermine their mighty efforts"" 

My biggest gripe with this govt hasn't been the bad decisions or corruption (and thank God for that). But the times when they drag along like a limp corspe from one day to another whilst not giving any clarity to those who are suffering. Nothing but respect for the Chinese doctors and average joes who are putting their lives at risk and battling everyday, but they are clearly over worked and under too much pressure, we need to look out for our own"

The Wuhan coronavirus spreading from China is now likely to become a pandemic that circles the globe, according to many of the world’s leading infectious disease experts.

The prospect is daunting. A pandemic — an ongoing epidemic on two or more continents — may well have global consequences, despite the extraordinary travel restrictions and quarantines now imposed by China and other countries, including the United States.

Scientists do not yet know how lethal the new coronavirus is, however, so there is uncertainty about how much damage a pandemic might cause. But there is growing consensus that the pathogen is readily transmitted between humans.

The Wuhan coronavirus is spreading more like influenza, which is highly transmissible, than like its slow-moving viral cousins, SARS and MERS, scientists have found.

160k is not a lot for China but it’s a lot for a small country like Singapore. Did he care about the needs of his host country? Doubt so. He is taking the supplies that we need.  And come on. China factory can produce face mask a lot faster. Is there really a need to send 160k mask back other than publicity?

And how the heck did he even get 160k surgical mask? Are they part of the 5 million that the government released to the retailers last week that were snapped up within hours?

Right now, I wish this Coronavirus thing will be over. But what if there is a community spread in Singapore and there are not enough surgical mask here? This is the same irresponsible China locust behavior that Hong Kongers were facing since 1997."

Even if the Coronavirus hadn’t hit, many schools would have still been closed for CNY for the next week or so. From what I’ve seen, Beijing has already extended the national CNY dates to the 9th(?) of February, which means everyone’s legally entitled to their full salary until at least then. A lot of school administrators are presumably still home with their families celebrating, so while there’s been some behind the scenes work, I doubt most have formed a coherent plan yet. I also strongly suspect that within the next week or so we’ll get further updates from our provincial governments and/ or Beijing. I don’t know anyone who’s made any decisions yet, since we’re all still waiting for more info.

If I had to guess, I’d say that schools around Asia (and more specifically in Japan, Korea, and Vietnam) will probably be finding it much easier to recruit teachers this spring than they’re used to, but there should still be plenty of opportunities to go around. From what I know of the expats living in China, many are far more likely to return to the their own lives than try to make a sustainable TEFL career in South America, Europe, or something like that. Really, though, until more teachers here find out whether or not their contracts are going to be suspended, it’s impossible to say."

Furthermore, a lot of people simply don't report to hospitals as there is very little space, you need to be fairly healthy just to navigate the hospitals in Wuhan  right now. 

The deaths are also a big question as reports suggest that the crematoriums have an unusual level of activity, even with the official deaths counted. Some of those who don't seek medical help will  have died at home. We also don't know if the stats are deliberately fudged by individual hospitals etc. 

We have no idea of the long term effect the virus has on people, it has been shown that significant levels of the virus remains in people who have stopped showing symptoms, and the infected remains contagious. There is a risk that the virus will lay dormant and then flair up later, either spontaneously or in combination with another illness."

I think it’s already too late, The novel coronavirus is here. 

I suspect almost all international flights will have infected people, staff or surfaces by now. You can try wearing a proper mask & gloves - don’t touch your face,. But it may be also transmitted through shit & vomit, so even a few particles floating around could infect people. 

Take care & please self isolate if you can until we know more. Please. It’s probably the only way we will be able to reduce the rapid spread of this virus. And you’ll be protected from all the idiots here who are too fixated on petty political bickering & fawning over the fucking BAfTAs & upcoming Academy awards to notice what’s happening. 

Very few, if any people here are taking this seriously, so I can’t trust that people will isolate themselves to protect others. The only people that are as alarmed & informed as me live overseas. It’s ridiculous. I’ve finished stocking up on essentials, Thursday this week will be the last time I will visit a public place & I’m hoping there won’t be many people there. 

I’ve already stopped purchasing fresh produce, meat (as with the measles outbreak - sneezing/coughing will  contaminate food) or buying food prepared elsewhere. I’ll get boxed/frozen groceries delivered if I run low & go to a remote beach or other unpopulated areas  if I need to get out of the house. If I touch anything outside of home, I use hand sanitizer after. I use a paywave card. I’m also getting into the habit of disinfecting surfaces, especially door handles. 

I’m not sure how viable it will be to visit my family members in the coming weeks but they’re perceptive people & are taking what I’m sharing with them on board. I have major issues with my immune system so I self isolate during flu season anyway. 

Oddly enough, my horrible immune system means I’m well prepared for this outbreak because I’ve been forced to keep myself alive & well on my own for years as our public health system & general attitude towards basic hygiene & not sneezing all over people is so backwards & shitty. 

After I almost died from influenza about a decade ago I ramped up my interest in pandemics & virology. Started researching historical data & records, everything I could get my hands on. This virus has so many red flags. The economic consequences of this outbreak alone is going to throw everything into chaos. Be prepared.

>Most importantly, we report the first recorded isolation of a live SL-CoV (bat SL-CoV-WIV1) from bat faecal samples in Vero E6 cells, which has typical coronavirus morphology, 99.9% sequence identity to Rs3367 and uses ACE2 from humans, civets and Chinese horseshoe bats for cell entry. Preliminary in vitro testing indicates that WIV1 also has a broad species tropism. Our results provide the strongest evidence to date that Chinese horseshoe bats are natural reservoirs of SARS-CoV, and that intermediate hosts may not be necessary for direct human infection by some bat SL-CoVs. They also highlight the importance of pathogen-discovery programs targeting high-risk wildlife groups in emerging disease hotspots as a strategy for pandemic preparedness."

Since 29/01 the number of infected went up rougly 200%, but the number of seriously ill has gone up about 66%.

This means China is now detecting new infections quicker than the rising number of seriously ill patients. Which is actually really good news. 

If this virus was completely out of control, the number of seriously sick people would rise at the same rate as the number of infected. That is not the case.

The big jump in infected cases is probably due to better testing. If they can detect infection faster than people are getting ill, then China may still be able to get this genie back in the bottle. It is a herculean task, but they seem to be doing something right, at last.

There was no shortage of scrutiny on the Chinese telecom giant last year, and a number of countries banned the use of its networking equipment. Its phones are virtually invisible in the US despite its massive presence around the world...

The core issue with Huawei has been concerns about its coziness with the Chinese government and fears that its equipment could be used to spy on other countries and companies. It's the reason why the US banned companies from using Huawei networking equipment in 2012 and why the company was added to the US Department of Commerce's Bureau of Industry and Security Entity List in May 2019, following an executive order from President Donald Trump effectively banning Huawei from US communications networks...

Avoid touristy places or places with large crowds (and if her immune system is lowered, she should have already been doing so already), wash her hands often and avoid touching her face and I think she’ll be fine.

In comparison, when I was undergoing radiation and chemo, my entire family got sick and I basically quarantined myself in my room. Didn’t get sick that time. When I was neutropenic a few months later, I avoided leaving the house until my blood counts rebounded and I didn’t get sick.

Unless things have changed in the last couple of days, they are saying this coronavirus doesn't have a mortality rate as high as SARS (which is also a coronavirus), but it's being spread much easier which is the problem.

Those masks DO make a difference, unfortunately for you. I would limit exposure but even a non N95 respirator is better than nothing, just realize it's effectiveness is greatly depleted.

Imo everyone should wear the mask, new reports are saying you might be able to spread the virus without presenting any symptoms (not sure if confirmed yet) which causes problems if we just give masks to people we know have it."

World Health Organization:
""Wearing a medical mask can help limit the spread of some respiratory disease. ""
Ref: https://www.who.int/news-room/q-a-detail/q-a-coronaviruses

They qualify it by going on to say,
""WHO advises on rational use of medical masks thus avoiding unnecessary wastage of precious resources and potential mis-use of masks (see Advice on the use of masks). This means using masks only if you have respiratory symptoms (coughing or sneezing), have suspected 2019-nCoV infection with mild symptoms or are caring for someone with suspected 2019-nCoV infection. A suspected 2019-nCoV infection is linked to travel in an area in China where 2019-nCoV has been reported, or close contact with someone who has travelled from China and has respiratory symptoms.""

Also:
If you work in a wet market, use a mask.
If you are travelling, it's up to you whether you wish to use a mask.
Ref: https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/advice-for-public

Taiwan's CDC issued guidance on 'Circumstances under which you might want to wear a mask', listing: when people are undergoing respiratory illnesses, are entering healthcare facilities, are in crowded spaces with limited ventilation, or have chronic illnesses.

SG gov has chosen to issue a blanket statement and is actively dissuading people from wearing masks, literally saying, ""People who are well do not need to wear a mask"", ""wear only if you have a runny nose or are coughing""(ref:https://www.gov.sg/article/masking-up-how-and-when-you-should-do-it). It's printed in red warning boxes across the front page of newspapers, sent out in JPEGs everywhere. And local businesses are taking heed from it, including RWS whose main target audience are the Chinese and whose staff operate in crowded spaces (""RWS stands guided by the Ministry of Health's advisory even before Jan 24, ref:https://www.tnp.sg/news/singapore/healthy-people-dont-need-wear-surgical-masks-experts). 

The US and Australia have not advised on the use of mask because the number of imported cases is low and the risk is low. Singapore was the second top destination the Wuhan people were leaving for, after Hong Kong, and is currently among the top 3 destinations with the highest number of cases outside of China."

Vatican sends hundreds of thousands of masks to China

From Hada Messia in Rome 

The Vatican has shipped hundreds of thousands of face masks to the Chinese provinces of Hubei, Zhejiang and Fujian in response to the coronavirus outbreak.

In a statement issued to CNN, Vatican spokesman Matteo Bruni said that the masks were sent ""to help stop the spread of the contamination of coronavirus.""

The pressure on the government's stockpile of masks is so significant now that even doctors in public hospitals are discouraged by MOH from wearing masks in the hospital when they are not doing clinics. There is also talk at the MOH level of reusing N95 masks if supplies run low.

Most doctors that I know believe that wearing a surgical mask offers some protection against the transmission of the coronavirus since SARS and MERS were mostly spread through droplets. It is important to note that even though most doctors in our restructured hospitals do not wear masks outside of clinics (because of MOH's directive),  **the doctors and nurses in private hospitals like Mount Elizabeth do wear surgical masks as a precaution**."

> The China Eastern Airlines charter jet will take off at 6:50 p.m. and is expected to arrive at Taiwan Taoyuan International Airport at 9 p.m. Hsiao said that Taiwanese businessmen in Wuhan will be notified of the exact flight times and dates and that TAO district offices will dispatch vehicles to transport them to the airport.

And a partial repost of a comment to another question on this sub:

Even without an outbreak like this, cases of pneumonia have to be reported to the CDC, so to they’re definitely being monitored now.

“Invasive pneumococcal disease is nationally notifiable meaning the laboratory who identifies the bacteria or the healthcare provider who is caring for the patient must report the case to the appropriate health department.  State health departments then report invasive pneumococcal disease cases to CDC through the National Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System (NNDSS). Some regions in the United States also use Active Bacterial Core surveillance (ABCs), a core component of CDC’s Emerging Infections Programs  (EIP) network, to report cases. State health departments do not report cases of non-invasive pneumococcal disease, like ear and sinus infections, through either surveillance system.”

https://www.cdc.gov/pneumococcal/surveillance.html#surveillance

The same kind of surveillance happens with seasonal influenza (see link the explains how the CDC monitors pneumonia and influenza deaths). So between the two there’s a lot of monitoring going on.

Even without coronavirus, people very often give cause of deaths that are discovered to be wrong months later. It might be even harder with people who weren’t confirmed infected with coronavirus yet that died. Since the hospitals are crowded, there probably are people with other diseases waiting for treatment and end up dying before they get it, or even get infected in the hospital but we can’t confirm if what killed was corona or the people would die anyway but got coronavirus before dying."

> ### **El miedo y la incertidumbre se apoderaron de la cotidianidad de Andrea Tovar quien comenta que nunca se imaginó que se enfrentaría al aislamiento a causa de una cepa, identificada como 2019-nCoV, que registra víctimas mortales y nuevos casos diariamente**
> 
> La tensión se siente en el ambiente. A 14.769 kilómetros de Caracas, su ciudad natal, el miedo se apodera de ella. Pekín se convirtió en el hogar de la venezolana Andrea Tovar y de sus dos hijos, que ahora se encuentran encerrados. La mayoría de las caras que se ven en las calles están cubiertas con tapabocas, pues el coronavirus causante de la neumonía de Wuhan activó las alertas en toda China y el mundo.
> 
> Hace un año, Andrea migró al otro lado del planeta y ha tratado de adaptarse a la cultura oriental. Sin embargo, todavía no domina el idioma y esto es lo que le genera más angustia en medio de la alerta sanitaria que existe en varias ciudades del país asiático.
> 
> A pesar de que se encuentra a 1.131 kilómetros de Wuhan, ciudad en la que se originó la cepa de coronavirus, bautizada como 2019-nCov, la tensión y el miedo se respira en la capital china de más de 30.000.000 de habitantes. Andrea no puede contener su angustia, porque la epidemia avanza y ya hay un muerto por esta causa en Pekín.
> 
> La venezolana lleva siete días sin salir de su casa por miedo a contagiarse con el coronavirus de Wuhan, cuya gravedad ha sido comparada con el SARS, un virus ya erradicado, pero que causó pánico en la población china hace 18 años.
> 
> Las autoridades de Wuhan, donde se registró el primer caso del 2019-nCov, cerraron la ciudad para contener la epidemia, prohibieron los viajes en vehículos y los hospitales del país se encuentran colapsados entre casos confirmados, sospechosos, observación y personas que acuden para saber si son portadores del virus.
> 
> El pánico se apodera de la población. La desesperación avanza al mismo ritmo que se propaga la enfermedad. Un total de 17 ciudades de China fueron cerradas mientras que sus habitantes, entre angustia y expectativa, toman todas las medidas necesarias para evitar contagiarse del virus, que hasta la presente fecha ha cobrado la vida de 132 personas y ha contagiado cerca de 6.000 personas, de acuerdo con medios locales.
> 
> Las autoridades de las ciudades tomaron decisiones drásticas que van desde clases suspendidas y funciones de cines cerrados hasta recomendar evitar asistir a espacios donde haya personas reunidas. “No hay gente en las calles, suspendieron las clases en todos los colegios públicos, privados e internacionales. Hay muchas tiendas cerradas y la mayoría de la gente usa máscaras si hay que salir”, cuenta Andrea.
> 
> Mientras su hogar se ha convertido en una cárcel por decisión propia, su aislamiento voluntario tiene como objetivo mantener a sus hijos y a ella misma sana. Ha detallado partes de su casa que antes pasaba por alto, ve películas repetidas y mira la pared en espera de una buena noticia. Su panorama es distinto al que reina en Wuhan, donde las imágenes del pánico recorren las redes sociales del mundo.
> 
> Los videos de los hospitales colapsados y la desesperación de los médicos por atender a la mayor cantidad de personas y evitar contagiarse, así como de personas quieren saber si son portadores del virus, son alarmantes.
> 
> Después de una semana sin pisar la calle, Andrea salió únicamente a comprar comida para su familia. Sabe que los lugares con concentraciones de personas pueden convertirse en un foco de contagio del virus, que se transmite mediante vías aéreas y a dos metros de los infectados.
> 
> En una ciudad tan concurrida como Pekín, la soledad se apoderó rápidamente de cada calle y de cada esquina valiéndose del miedo de cada poblador de adquirir tan temido virus.
> 
> Antes de salir de su vivienda cubrió cada parte de su cuerpo con abrigos, guantes, gorro, bufanda y el infaltable tapaboca. Mientras realizaba su trayecto, al tanto de todo lo que ocurre a su alrededor, el anhelo de regresar a su país se hacía cada vez más fuerte. Ella le explicó a sus hijos pequeños a qué se enfrentan, y entienden, pero la imposibilidad de salir, aunque sea al colegio, los aburre.
> 
> Andrea quisiera traer a sus hijos de regreso a Venezuela, desea que vuelvan a la tierra que los vio nacer, pero ni siquiera huir es posible para ella. El riesgo de contagio es mayor en los aeropuertos, los medios económicos para salir del país son limitados y las salidas de China están cerradas. Las limitantes la obligan a resignarse, quedarse en su apartamento y esperar a que el virus sea erradicado.
> 
> Revisa su celular con frecuencia durante el día. Con cada noticia sobre el coronavirus de Wuhan su miedo aumenta. La anhelada cura es incierta y la angustia invade las ciudades. Sin embargo, la epidemia no es el único problema que afecta a la familia de ella: teme enfermarse, de cualquier cosa, y tener que ir a un centro de salud donde se enfrentaría a la barrera del idioma.
> 
> Esta es una pequeña gota del mar de preocupaciones que hoy invaden la mente de Andrea. Enfermarse implica tener que recibir atención médica, la cual es sumamente costosa en China.
> 
> Estar en un país ajeno, con una cultura muy diferente a la venezolana y que atraviesa un problema público de salud, genera una distancia abismal entre ella y la tranquilidad.
> 
> Todo es un riesgo. Salir a la calle implica armarse de valor. Una persona puede contagiar a otra a pesar de no tener síntomas. La incertidumbre y el temor a la hora de comprar comida o hablar con alguien cada vez es mayor, por eso prefiere no hacerlo y quedarse en la seguridad de su casa. “Hoy acabo de leer un reporte de la Organización Mundial de la Salud, que dice que el virus es contagioso en su momento de incubación, lo que quiere decir que aunque alguien no presente síntomas, igual puede contagiar a otros. Y eso me estresa mucho más de lo que ya estaba estresada. Ahora salir e interactuar con quien sea, extranjeros o chinos, supone un peligro. Montarse en un avión e irse es un peligro. Así que queda es confiar en que las autoridades chinas están haciendo lo posible por contener el virus y encontrar curas y/o vacunas, y quedarme encerrada en mi casa por lo que parece ser el próximo mes”.
> 
> **RECUADRO**
> 
> **Virus lejano**
> 
> Al otro lado del mundo, la crisis del coronavirus de Wuhan se percibe como una realidad lejana. A mares de distancia se ignora la desesperación y miedo que hoy invade a los habitantes de China. El pánico va haciendo de las suyas entre la población, la demanda de insumos como los tapabocas aumenta y la escasez de hace presente.
> 
> Amigos de Andrea compraron pasajes para irse a Europa cuando se supo del brote del coronavirus, pero en el presupuesto familiar de la venezolana no se puede realizar un viaje imprevisto porque no cuentan con los recursos.
> 
> En China, el “delivery” es un servicio cotidiano, pero desde hace un mes Andrea ha evitado pedir comida o cualquier producto a domicilio. “¿Y si el repartidor está contagiado?”, se cuestiona.
> 
> Entre las recomendaciones que Andrea ha acatado, aparte del aislamiento, es evitar el contacto con extraños y animales salvajes, además de lavarse constantemente las manos y mantener la higiene del hogar, un buen pasatiempo en medio del encierro.
> 
> Sin estar contagiada, su miedo la obliga a vivir en una cuarentena obligada. Sus días transcurren entre la incertidumbre de saber cuándo recuperará su vida, cuándo sus hijos volverán al colegio o cuándo podrá salir a la calle sin que el terror se apodere de ella."

It’s a guess. It’s also totally possible that the numbers reported are not accurate or China is hiding something else. That said, if we take everything we know at face value, it seems overblown and China has in turn created an overblown response. 

Coronavirus is a family of viruses, not just this one in China. They make you sick sure, but if you’re not immunocompromised in some way and you get it, there is a better chance than not that modern treatment will keep you alive."

An airborne disease is any disease that is caused by pathogens that can be transmitted through the air. Such diseases include many of considerable importance both in human and veterinary medicine. The relevant pathogens may be viruses, bacteria, or fungi, and they may be spread through breathing, talking, coughing, sneezing, raising of dust, spraying of liquids, toilet flushing or any activities which generates aerosol particles or droplets. Human airborne diseases do not include conditions caused by air pollution such as Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs), gases and any airborne particles.

This is really just cognitive dissonance writ large. They are desperate to find an answer as to why modern science has essentially failed to reinforce fundamentalist delusions, and worse, actively contradicts them. The obvious way out of that mess is to assert that scientists are all morally corrupt and under the sway of the Enemy. Even when they see the results of climate change all around them, and are faced with actual evidence of evolution (where did the Wuhan Coronavirus come from?), they can still reject reality and avoid having to face the truth."

It’s been a different feeling than what I normally get where something like the flu just causes compulsions I have to deal with.

Anyway, I hope you stay healthy and happy, internet stranger!"

We know of like 8 or 9 other coronaviruses, but this one isn’t one of those; it’s the first time we’ve seen it and it hasn’t been officially named yet, so it’s a new or novel coronavirus. When they first discovered those other coronaviruses, they were called a “novel coronavirus” at first too, which is just saying a “new coronavirus”. 

This one should get a more official name when we know more about it. Like I said, now the only “official” name is 2019-nCoV.

2020-02-03,fernguts,Calgary,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Calgary/comments/ey5tpy/calgary_losing_its_youth/fgfupii/,"What is the magic solution to helping the rural areas and small towns?  Family farming has been dying for decades. Steel and coal are never coming back to industrial Cape Breton in any great way, and those were the reasons why those towns existed in the first place. Diversifying the economy of single-industry towns is always enormously difficult, and people struggle with that world-wide.  

Nova Scotia's forests are already stretched beyond the breaking point, so it was an ecological blessing that the Pictou pulp mill has at least been mothballed, but of course that's also thousands more job losses. 

It's difficult to attract industry to a place that's off the beaten track, although Halifax has had a lot of success building its IT and tech industries. The three Michelin plants continue to be cornerstones of their local economies, but they require tax breaks to keep them here, which are unsurprisingly controversial.

Aside from the lobster fishery (which is currently taking a hit from the coronavirus), there are no job prospects in Nova Scotia, outside of tourism. The problem with tourism however is that the season only last half a year (if that), so the jobs associated with it are hardly the sort of career you can raise a family on. 

The province's finances are screwed because for generations we've been exporting mostof our people to places like Alberta and Ontario, where hey spend their entire careers paying taxes in those jurisdictions, but then they (understandably) want to retire back east, just as their health case costs are going up substantially. That extra strain on the system is a big part of why ER wait times are so long, and their are so few family doctors, but it's worth noting that without transfer payments from other provinces, we would be *completely* screwed. Quebecers might take transfer payments for granted,  but I'd like to think that most Maritimers are quite grateful. 

TL;DR: The future of Nova Scotia is of a thriving Halifax, but a depopulated rural region, transformed into a summer-colony for the wealthy. If anybody has any ideas on how to turn things around, I'd love to hear them."

Will Climate Change increase the transmission of diseases and eventually introduce entirely new diseases through glacial melting? Of course. I even said so from my very first comment. *But that has nothing to do with the coronavirus and other common Asian flu viruses.*

And thats my point. Climate Change causes a lot of problems, but if you start blaming every problem on Climate Change, even when its not the cause, you'll turn the entire movement into the boy who cried wolf.

That's simply not true: yes it went from $83 to $50 in a year where the market was killing it.  But that was a response to something very specific: Call of Duty: Black Ops.  Look at when opening day sales were announced and stock performance over subsequent 2 months. 

In general, ATVI has been a fantastic stock. It was at $19 at the start of 2015, and it's currently at $59; it more than tripled over a 5 year period.  That's slightly worse than TTWO (which is up \~5x) and significantly better than EA (\~1.5x) and the NASDAQ.  So if you're trying to make the argument that ATVI's stock has underperformed because it's poorly run, I just don't see how that argument is there unless you choose a narrow time window which happens to include a 2-month window when the stock fell 40% after going on a 400% tear over the prior 3 years.

Just because people get infected and die from coronavirus, it doesn't mean there are no other causes of death anymore. 

People still get sick and die for all kind of reason, as they always have. In a city of 11 Million, there has to be hundreds, if not thousands of people dying every day. You dont need a plague to get those numbers. 

However, some doomsdayers here will tell you that absolutely every single person who died in China over the last 30 days, died of coronavirus. And the governments are hiding this from us because they want us all to die, which sounds reasonable.

&#x200B;

I personally believe the number of deaths is slightly higher than reported, but this is because some people got infected and died before their tests could be confirmed. Those people would likely not get reported as coronavirus casualties, since the chinese are not doing further tests on deceased people, due to testing capacity constraints."

Coronavirus mortality rate is so far only 2% because most people recently got infected and it hasn't played out yet. The final rate will probably be below 40% as we figure out treatment methods for it, but even 2% is deadly AF. For comparison, the annual death rate for people infected with AIDS today is 1.25%.

The unique fear of seeing a doctor and lack of sick leave benefits will probably lead to widespread human-to-human transmission if the coronavirus starts spreading in communities."

The story was debunked by Facebook fact-checking partner PolitiFact.

US wants to re-route global supply chain around China, to bypass China and isolate China on the world stage vs China wanting to use Huawei-enabled digital-blockchain Yuan, cashless WeChat, etc to topple the US Petrodollar hegemony and the BRI relationships and bi-lateral trade/infrastructure agreements in order to propel the world to adopt the use of the digital Yuan, and in order to have the world bypass the SWIFT system (since US has abused its dollar status and weaponized it for unlawful sanctions) and the US dollar as the default global reserve currency etc. It was a race against time to see whom would pull the rug from underneath the other countries feet first. US, unable to compete fairly due to its structural disadvantages and many other shortcomings, decided to go the biological attack route, which allows it to hide under the cover of ""plausible denialability"" (since it is more difficult to conclusively prove the attribution or source of a new mysterious virus than it would be to track the trajectory of an incoming thermnonuclear missile etc) to inflict maximum damage to China while minimizing the potential blow back. 

Right after the signing of the so-called ""Trade Deal"" in which the US didn't get what it wanted (the US did not get the sort of Plaza Accord concessions that it was hoping XI/CCP would kowtow to etc) and immediately into the start of the new decade (marking the turn of the second decade in what the PNAC would called the ""new american century"") the US resorted to biological attacks in order to contain, isolate and attempt to cripple China/CCP internally and on the world stage at large. After its NED/CIA sponsored Hong Kong destablization/radicialization didn't spill over into the rest of mainland China, and right after its intense year long anti-China anti-Huawei campaigns have peaked in effectiveness, the US releases the evil demon virus into the heart of mainland China, at the absolutely worst possible location (Wuhan being one of the Chinese main Central hubs in terms of transportation and an important city for China's Belt and Road initiatives  and estimated to have as high as 8% growth in GDP in 2020) and in also the absolute worse possible timing (right before the Chinese Lunar New year, otherwise known as the greatest annual human migration event, during a time in which shopping, spending and consumerisms activity would have been at a peak etc) in order to cripple China economically, to cut China off from the rest of the world and even force China to isolate its own cities from within, and to have the effect of smearing China's reputation on the world stage and invoking the escalation of fear, racisms and bigotry towards the Chinese people abroad.  

All this comes right on top of the heels of the event last fall, African swine fever (ASF), which had never before seen in China but now mysteriously appeared with the onset of the US trade war, decimated half of China's pigs, which doubled pork prices and contributed to inflation causing pricy US pork exports to double in China. The odds for two such consequent anomalies, timing and location are exceedingly low. Yet both did occur – in almost perfect sequence. Particularly devasting is the very real possibility that this virus was intentionally engineered to have as long an incubation period as possible, and with the ability to hide within plain site, by being asymptomatic during its initial stages hence making it orders of magnitude more difficult to eradicate. Just recently, as recent as Feb 1st 2020, there has been yet a third mysterious outbreak in China, this time of the bird flu kind that is far more deadly to humans and wiping out Chinese chicken and poultry at the most dire of times. Indeed the coronavirus victims so far, both inside and outside of China, are only people with Chinese type of blood, Haplogroup O-M175, designed to attack that type of blood and specifically Chinese people."

>A sector insider who declined to be named said the other major log exporters were continuing to accept log supply and would continue to send them to New Zealand ports that handle log ships. He conceded however that harvesting would slowdown as a result of the China situation. 

>His claim of a limited stop on logs was supported by another company. But that company said the situation was changing so fast this might not remain the case.

We can look at history with SARS that was spreading in China and had upwards of a 10% morbidity rate with primarily males, but was not deadly and did not continue to spread globally. This is consistent with how 2019-nCov is behaving now.

Your points:
1. Some preliminary evidence this is the case, but not enough to be fully conclusive. The preliminary evidence so far does align with infection and morbidity data for both SARS and 2019-nCov and the SNP data...

Coronavirus is controllable, but if people don't give attention to it, it can take millions of lives. That's why people are very worried and being cautious, to control the virus like we did with previous outbreaks of new viruses.

 Uma versão agressiva do H5N1 foi detectada em uma fazenda na cidade de Shaoyang, província de Hunan, informou o Ministério da Agricultura e Assuntos Rurais. Os primeiros casos foram relatados no sábado (1º), em uma fazenda com 7.850 galinhas, das quais 4.500 morreram devido à gripe.

 As autoridades já sacrificaram 17.828 aves após o anúncio.

 A gripa aviária é altamente contagiosa entre os animais. Há contágio para humanos que tenham contato com os animais, mas a transmissão entre humanos é mais rara. Segundo o jornal New York Times, a OMS (Organização Mundial da Saúde) pediu atenção aos casos em seres humanos para que se monitore a transmissão nesse novo registro da doença. 

 Segundo dados da OMS, desde 2003, a gripe aviária H5N1 matou cerca de 455 pessoas em todo o mundo.

  O registro de gripe aviária é novo baque no agronegócio chinês. Ocorre no momento em que país previa aumento na produção e consumo desse tipo de carne para compensar outro problema sanitário local, o surto de peste suína africana. 

 Os primeiros [casos da peste suína foram](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/colunas/vaivem/2018/11/peste-suina-na-china-forca-pais-a-elevar-importacao-de-carnes.shtml) registrados em agosto de 2018. De lá para cá, reduziu quase pela metade o rebanho de porcos do país, segundo dados oficiais. A doença chegou a todas as províncias e já há casos em vários outros países.

 Devido ao abate de matrizes, a previsão era de queda de 15% na oferta de carne suína neste ano, apontou um relatório do Rabobank, banco especializado em agronegócio. 

  

 Nesta segunda-feira (3), em seu primeiro dia de operação desde o dia 23 de janeiro, o mercado de ações chinês fechou com forte queda devido ao temor da ampliação da epidemia de coronavírus.

 O índice que reúne todas as ações negociadas na Bolsa de Xangai terminou o dia com queda de 7,72%. Já a Bolsa de Shenzhen recuou 8,41%.

&#x200B;

Ain't that the truth.  On another medium i am sure we could have a great convo about it. As it stands I'll be downvoted to oblivion and unable to post without timers.  Have a great day.

&#x200B;

\\> However the MASSIVE difference here is that right wing media and think tanks have been WAAAY more successful.  

&#x200B;

I disagree with how effective advertising has been.  Liberals think tanks fostered AntiFA.  You can't say that isn't a major repercussion.  This is simply incorrect.

&#x200B;

\&#x200B;

&#x200B;

\\>  There's more funding, more outlets, and a more ""agreeable"" (hostile) base. 

&#x200B;

\&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Wrong.  There are far more liberal think tanks, liberal media outlets and liberal social media sites than there are conservative.  The site you are on right now leans heavily to the left.  Facebook & Twitter both have the same hard left-wing biases.

&#x200B;

\\> Whereas main stream media, and historically trusted outlets are all labelled ""leftist"" by the right, which becomes a a gradeschool argument, not based in reality.  

&#x200B;

\&#x200B;

&#x200B;

No, that is again incorrect and based in partisanship.  These organizations no longer report the 'news', they report what you are supposed to feel, then give you the facts afterwards.  They also heavily skew toward left-wing ideology, and this is proven.  So, your dismissal of these facts makes your point highly irrelevant.  The mainstream media is heavily, heavily skewed to the left, they have 94% negative coverage of anything conservative. 

&#x200B;

\&#x200B;

&#x200B;

<>The phrase ""reality has a liberal bias"" is TRUE. 

&#x200B;

\&#x200B;

&#x200B;

No it is not true.  Any adult will tell you this is simply a lie liberals have told themselves for years.  The truth is, most people start out as liberals and as they grow up and gain life experience they become conservatives.

&#x200B;

\&#x200B;

&#x200B;

\&#x200B;

&#x200B;

\\> When ACTUAL Liberal media pump out their B.S. it's about SJW issues, political correctness, bad info on gun control, and race baiting (none of which I agree with). 

&#x200B;

Yes it is, and it's constant. And they make everything an SJW issue and turn everyone who doesn't agree with them into a racist.

&#x200B;

\&#x200B;

&#x200B;

\\>When Conservatives do it, it's fear-mongering, conspiracy theories, and all the back channel/online/religious funding of hate groups directed towards ""the Muzzies"" and ""the gays."" 

&#x200B;

It is 100% the exact same as when liberals do it.  It's fear mongering (everyone is racist oh no!!), it's conspiracy theories (coronavirus is really a ploy of right wingers to be racist to china!!!!) and it's lies (in that any mainstream Canadian has an issue with gays.)  In terms of 'the muzzies!!!!', yes they are a security threat that needs to be monitored.  Pretending they aren't is like pretending the coronavirus isn't a threat from China.  Threats to Canadians exist, whether you like to pretend they don't or not.

&#x200B;

\&#x200B;

&#x200B;

\&#x200B;

&#x200B;

\\> I've been told as long as I can remember that the ""Liberals spend too much"" and are a threat and something something GDP, and pull up our bootstraps. ... nothing has happened 

&#x200B;

Everything has happened.  You refuse to allow the consequences to sink in because you live in Liberal fantasyland.  The exact things we are talking about - spending cuts, to education, to welfare, across the board - are all direct results of liberal overspending.  You can't refuse to accept reality then try and tell someone who does accept it that it  isn't happening.  This is plain and simple.  You pretend there isn't a budget crisis because it suits your narrative that spending can go on forever unimpeded.  It can't, sorry, this is a fact of life.

&#x200B;

\&#x200B;

&#x200B;

\\> How come churches and corporations and billionaires get tax breaks (or subsidies from all political parties?). Tax them. We need education, and we need healthcare services. Those don't need to be cut. 

&#x200B;

\&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I don't agree with them not being taxed.  We do need education, and we need healthcare, but they are going to have to be cut in order to make up for liberal mismanagemnet.  It isn't punishment, it's the reality of life.  When you spend too much on your credit card one month, you have to tighten up the next.  In this case they haven't tightened up for 15 years, so it's much worse.

&#x200B;

\&#x200B;

&#x200B;

\\> As for controlling the media - I wholly disagree with that. I don't know what the fuck the Liberal party is suggesting in that regard. I have to look into it more. 

&#x200B;

That's precisely what happens when the government is the body keeping news agencies afloat, they won't bite the hand that feeds.

&#x200B;

\&#x200B;

 Segundo o ministro Luiz Henrique Mandetta (Saúde), a decretação da situação de emergência ocorrerá para dar agilidade ao Estado na contratação de equipamentos sanitários e na montagem da [área de quarentena que receberá os brasileiros retornados da cidade de Wuhan](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/equilibrioesaude/2020/02/brasileiros-no-epicentro-do-coronavirus-podem-passar-por-quarentena-em-anapolis.shtml), epicentro do surto de coronavírus na China.

 Mandetta falou após reunião na Casa Civil para acertar os detalhes do [retorno desses brasileiros](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/equilibrioesaude/2020/02/brasileiros-em-wuhan-gravam-apelo-a-bolsonaro-por-retirada-da-china.shtmlhttps://www1.folha.uol.com.br/equilibrioesaude/2020/02/brasileiros-no-epicentro-do-coronavirus-podem-passar-por-quarentena-em-anapolis.shtml). Segundo ele, são aproximadamente [40 brasileiros em Wuhan que manifestaram interesse em voltar ao Brasil](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/equilibrioesaude/2020/02/brasileiros-que-estao-na-china-retornarao-ao-brasil-anuncia-governo.shtml). 

 O estado de emergência permite ao governo contratações emergenciais mais rápidas para fazer frente aos esforços de contenção do vírus, dispensando por exemplo processos licitatórios. 

 A OMS (Organização Mundial da Saúde) declarou na quinta (30) que[ o coronavírus é uma emergência de saúde global](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/equilibrioesaude/2020/01/oms-declara-emergencia-de-saude-internacional-por-coronavirus.shtml). 

  O protocolo estabelece que o estado de emergência seria ativado, em condições normais, após a confirmação de um caso de [coronavírus no Brasil](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/equilibrioesaude/2020/02/chegada-de-coronavirus-pode-colocar-sus-ja-saturado-em-xeque.shtml) —[o que até o momento não ocorreu](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/equilibrioesaude/2020/01/brasil-tem-12-casos-suspeitos-de-coronavirus-5-novos-sao-identificados-em-sp.shtml). Mas o governo Bolsonaro tomou a decisão de reconhecer a emergência, entre outras razões, para preparar a chegada dos brasileiros retornados. 

 ""Embora a gente [não tenha nenhum caso comprovado no Brasil](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/equilibrioesaude/2020/01/brasil-tem-12-casos-suspeitos-de-coronavirus-5-novos-sao-identificados-em-sp.shtml) —não temos a presença do vírus em laboratório dentro do Brasil— nós vamos reconhecer esta emergência sanitária internacional para poder ter mecanismos. Porque se não você tem que abrir licitação, leva 15, 20 dias para conseguir se movimentar quando se está no status normal da lei de licitações e compras. Então a gente vai antecipar mesmo não tendo nenhum caso confirmado"", disse o ministro. 

Mandetta não informou quando o voo fretado pelo Brasil deixará o país com destino à China. Mais cedo, em entrevista à Rádio Gaúcha, o ministro Onyx Lorenzoni (Casa Civil) disse que o avião deve decolar até esta terça (4), com retorno previsto para quinta (6) ou sexta (7). Lorenzoni também afirmou que a [tendência é que a quarentena ocorra numa base militar em Anápolis](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/equilibrioesaude/2020/02/brasileiros-no-epicentro-do-coronavirus-podem-passar-por-quarentena-em-anapolis.shtml) (GO). Mandetta disse que essa decisão ainda não está tomada, mas reconheceu que a área militar na cidade goiana tem vantagens. 

 ""Existe uma base militar, em Anápolis, que tem vantagens. Pela proximidade com o Hospital de Forças Armadas em Brasília, com leitos que podem ser separados"". Ele citou ainda uma base em Florianópolis que também teria condições de receber os retornados. 

 Ainda segundo o ministro da Saúde, o prazo de quarentena deve ser de 18 dias. O governo está consultando o protocolo de outros países para saber se a tripulação que realizará a missão de repatriação também deverá [cumprir o isolamento](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/equilibrioesaude/2020/01/estados-unidos-declaram-que-coronavirus-e-emergencia-de-saude-publica.shtml). A princípio, disse Mandetta, as informações dão conta de que, com a [proteção adequada](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/equilibrioesaude/2020/01/coronavirus-ja-provoca-corrida-as-farmacias-e-mascaras-somem-em-sp.shtml), o período que a tripulação ficará [afastada poderá ser cumprido em ambiente domiciliar](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/equilibrioesaude/2020/01/embaixada-recomenda-que-chineses-que-viajaram-ao-brasil-fiquem-em-quarentena-em-casa.shtml). 

 O ministro da Saúde afirmou ainda que os brasileiros que manifestaram interesse em retornar serão submetidos a um exame prévio antes do embarque. De acordo com ele, pessoas com sintomas do coronavírus não poderão deixar Wuhan. 

 ""Você não pode trazer uma pessoa com febre ou que esteja gripada com as outras no avião"", disse Mandetta. Por fim, ele disse que só serão evacuados os brasileiros em Wuhan porque a cidade concentra 70% dos casos de coronavírus e que o próprio governo chinês bloqueou o local. 

 O governo também deve enviar em breve ao Congresso Nacional uma Medida Provisória que cria a figura de quarentena sanitária no Brasil. A ausência de uma legislação desse tipo foi apontada pelo presidente Jair Bolsonaro como uma das razões que dificultam a evacuação.

 O status de emergência nacional em saúde pública já foi decretado em outras ocasiões no Brasil, como na recente [crise da zika e microcefalia no Brasil](https://arte.folha.uol.com.br/tudo-sobre/o-mosquito/)."

- The virus is spread by droplets as far as  we know, which is the same as all of the other coronaviruses that we know of, and makes sense biologically. Droplet are small bits of moisture (spit, mucus, saliva) that we cough/sneeze/breathe out that carry the virus. The CDC/WHO have not officially said this is droplet, though, and is still recommending airborne precautions for healthcare workers. We won't know for a while. To put this in perspective, the official CDC SARS recommendation is still airborne if you have the equipment for it, and it's been years since SARS. Airborne is more strict than droplet.
- Surgical masks work for droplet spread (plus eye protection and other PPE).
- N95 masks work for airborne spread (plus eye protection and other PPE).
- Therefore, either surgical masks or N95 would help with coronavirus. If you want to be  as safe as possible, go with N95, but don't ignore surgical masks if that's all  you have.
- Masks are  useful to both prevent you catching the virus, and prevent you spreading it if you already have it. 
- N95 masks are rated to stop 95% of the droplets, N99 99%, N100 100%. For the purpose of  this, P and N  masks are identical (P is overkill, but sometimes all you can find).
- The gaps on N and P rated masks are 0.3 microns. Virus particles are 0.1 microns BUT the droplets they're on are 0.5+ microns, so will be caught by the mask.

Ansiedade é você desejar ou criar expectativas demasiadas sobre um determinado fato. Um exemplo: vamos dizer que você estava ancioso para ver o filme do Coringa no dia da estréia. Isso causa certo furor positivo e as expectativas por este até mesmo lhe fazem executar planejamentos como por exemplo sair uma hora mais cedo do trampo, marcar com amigos, etc. Outro caso clássico é a ansiedade do candidato que fez um processo seletivo de uma empresa na qual deseja muito trabalhar e a responsável do RH diz que retornará com a resposta em breve. A partir daí a ansiedade emula uma série de cenários : será que a responsável do RH nunca vai me ligar? Será que vai ter uma segunda fase da entrevista não mencionada nese primeiro momento? Será que ela vai ligar em poucos dias ou até mesmo, daqui a pouco? Será que falei algo desconcertante durante a entrevista?

O que você tem, por incrível que parece, não é absolutamente nada. Você simplesmente se deixa levar por notícias impactantes e imagina que um dia você será o alvo. O CoronaVirus mesmo por exemplo, sendo arma biologica ou não - até chegar no Brasil, através de um possível infectado, que vai ficar em quarentena e acompanhamento de médicos especialistas, pense um pouco quais são as suas chances?

Sobre elevador caindo - os elevadores atuais possuem molas no poço, travas de segurança em toda sua estrutura, cabos bem constuídos para segurar o peso máximo. Só em algum filme B (B de babaca mesmo, como o premonição) que daria uma zica daquela. E digo mais, os elevadores da década de 50, 60 sao tão bem projetados quanto os de hoje por conta da obsolecência programada das partes.

BTW what are people's opinions on what the translation is for 你是在hello? Wu said they're living in a parallel universe, but I think that's putting it too mildly.

Let's review: 

The first cases of this virus appeared Dec 8-18. Doctors started speculating it might be SARS or something else Dec 30-31. On Dec 31 Wuhan health officials released an urgent warning about the virus. On Jan 1 the market where the virus originated from was shut down for cleaning and disinfecting. Jan 9 the first death from the virus occurred and WHO released a statement about a novel coronavirus having been isolated.

On Jan 23 a lockdown was put in place on Wuhan and other cities in Wubei. For this the WHO has piled heaps of praise on Chinese officials for their response, repeatedly, and told the press that the rest of the world should be grateful to China for the measures they have implemented.

Meanwhile in Reality Land the time between Jan 9 and 23 the following occurred: the gene sequence was identified and given a name, human to human transmission was recorded, over 600 laboratory confirmed cases were recorded, including in Guangdong, Zhejiang, Tainjin, Jiangxi, Guangxi, Guizhou, Fujian, Anhui, Shanxi, Ningxia, Shandong, Hunan, Yunnan, Hainan, Sichuan, Chongqing, Shanghai, Beijing, Hong Kong, Macau, Bangkok, South Korea, Singapore, Vietnam, the United States and Taiwan. There was also the super spreader who infected 14 people in Wuhan and 16 more deaths. Oh, and a banquet in Wuhan **attended by 14,000 families** for new year festivities, after it was known that the virus was spreading. [China also started jailing those who were critical of the government's response to the outbreak](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/22/health/virus-corona.html).

Basically the virus was already spreading for weeks by the time China did something about it. Every single province in China had cases by the time they started locking down cities. [The mayor of Wuhan himself said that the city's response to the outbreak was slowed by government transparency with Chinese characteristics](https://www.newsweek.com/who-praises-china-country-that-deserves-gratitude-respect-some-question-coronavirus-1484716).

>""China is doing the right things, and China is responding in a massive way,"" Dr. Michael Ryan, executive director of the WHO Health Emergencies Program, told reporters on Wednesday. ""We've seen no obvious lack of transparency.""

Imagine if There had been an outbreak like this in Switzerland. And in the time it took for Swiss officials to identify that there was a problem and enforcing travel restrictions, the virus spread to every single other country in Europe. That's what happened in China except Europe is not a single authoritarian communist regime that has total control of everything.

WHO said last week this wasn't an international public heath emergency, they've since reversed that. The week before they described the risk assessment for the virus as ""moderate"" which they later said was a typo and should have been described as ""high"". That was around the time they were saying that everyone needed to be ""sensitive"" to China's issues in controlling the virus.

>""Before we start pointing the finger at China, we need to recognize there are genuine sensitivities around sharing data around new diseases, and I believe, in this case, the countries that have been affected, including China, have been remarkably transparent in this regard,"" \[Michael\] Ryan said.

Joseph Wu is right to be taking WHO to task on this bullshit. And he's the only one doing it. They are so in the tank for China right now it's ridiculous. The UN once again out there coddling dictators."

Not at all. If you believe that a blessed item carries with it more intrinsic power/divine aid than a non-blessesed item (however you wish to define that), then that is your answer. (So, do you believe this? Or do you believe the only real effect of blessing an item is placebo?)

Where the problem lies, however, is in demonstrating that there is any truth to this claim whatsoever. Hence the whole point. 

> We do not make a laundry list of demands of God, with an expectation that He will check off the items on our list. We do not demand miracles. If you are looking for Catholics to say, “”This Coronavirus will be eradicated if you ask for the intercession of a Saint who fought a plague,” you are going to be disappointed.


I know this a common talking point/retort, but no one is demanding anything here. If blessed items  have *any* kind of effect beyond placebo, we would expect to observe some kind of manifestation of this phenomenon regardless of whether we understand how it works or not. So, does there exist such an observable phenomenon to support this?"

I was expecting the coronavirus to cause a hit, but also with the possibility of a Democrat in the white house and saying that they are going to tax Wall Street to pay for everything. I believe that this could correspond to a big growth in Crypto. Greed will always win. If crypto is in the mists of a bull market and the stock market is falling, people will go where the money is."

Not a permabear, but can see a few headwinds into our future:

1. High iron ore prices will come down, as the Brazilian mine that was flooded comes back on line
2. Moves afoot in our export markets to retire coal fired power stations 
3. Recent bushfires which have impacted a good portion of our arable land. Impact of rebuilding will offset this, but new building codes could see  replacement costs exceed insurance payouts. Tourism also may be affected
4. Coronavirus impact still not certain- but tourism and education will be affected. If mortality rate is actually higher than reported, this will feed through into reduced demand for our exports
5. US and China ongoing trade tensions
6. Aging baby boomer cohort into (traditionally) those ages where consumption drops (unless Spending Up The Kids Inheritance)
6. High household debt means any external shock feeding into higher interest rates leaves us more exposed than otherwise 

We do have plusses though. But I'm not convinced that current economic conditions will carry forward indefinitely. You are correct in saying that no central bank will want to increase rates, but an exogenous shock to any large economy will ripple through to other economies due to their interconnectedness.

Best wishes!"
2020-02-03,Koalabella,DebateACatholic,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateACatholic/comments/ewpq2n/corona_virus_and_st_benedict_medal/fgfyfu3/,"The question is an unanswerable one, partially because it’s very vague and partially because its answer is a mystery. Will praying with x Saint help in what way?  Keep you from getting the virus?  Keep everyone from getting the virus?  Shorten the duration of the virus?  Bring peace to those with the virus?  

As Catholics, we pray for people who are sick and suffering, and we believe that prayer helps in intangible, holistic ways. We believe that that prayer brings us closer to God and that the prayer accomplishes more than that, but we are not given the logistics of that help. 

We do not make a laundry list of demands of God, with an expectation that He will check off the items on our list. We do not demand miracles. 

If you are looking for Catholics to say, “”This Coronavirus will be eradicated if you ask for the intercession of a Saint who fought a plague,” you are going to be disappointed."

Memes are fun, but ‘Chinese people are purposely traveling and spreading the virus’ for probably 99% of cases is wrong, it just broke out at the perfect place at the perfect time to spread it across the planet, and it transmits before it starts showing symptoms (it’s like the perfect IRL plague inc. virus)."

I agree on your point that there are many nasty coronavirus in particular originating from the wild. I studied SARS, and MERS quite a bit. This virus is unlike anything I’ve ever seen before, and it seems to have auto immuno suppressive effects, much like how HIV destroys your bodies immune ability to fight off infection.

That is not a common effect of known Coronoviruses. When an isolated event happens, it’s easy to chalk it up to coincidence. When many isolated coincidences all line up against the official story, taking into account everything coming out of China, Wuhan in particular, my reasoning leads me to believe this was most likely a research lab, where it just so happens, is the coronavirus publication and research capital of the world, where the only level 4 bio-hazard level in all of China is located, probably screwed up somehow and this was released by accident.

Not sure how this makes me a tin foil nut case. That all sounds pretty reasonable if you view it objectively and also like you said, keeping in mind who (China) is feeding us official statistics and numbers.

This is a country that has banned Twitter and Google, has a social credit score, and erases parts of their entire history to its own citizens. You seem intelligent; all I ask of people like yourself is to utilize critical thinking, and form your own opinion. Be cautious and wary. Not panic. But the chances this story is false and much bigger than we are led to believe, are much higher than the chances of the official story and statistics panning out to be accurate."

I mean, there thousands of deaths, but about 400 were confirmed being deaths by coronavirus, the others might be for other problems that people generally have.

As far as I’m concerned, the ones who die and were confirmed patients of Coronavirus, have their cause of death labeled as “viral pneumonia caused by coronavirus” or something like that. But the ones that weren’t confirmed as patients of coronavirus before the death, I’m not sure are they being labeled. What I know is that they are cremating people instead of burying to prevent spreading the virus even more.

Although in other countries where the virus is under control and the infected people are properly isolated, they will probably do the autopsy of the dead.

Just a theory tho, it makes sense cremating people as soon as possible to avoid spreading virus from the dead. Principally with crowded hospitals and lack of supplies."

A lot of the deaths aren't being recorded as being associated with the virus. Confirmed cases are lowballed. Even the number infected is pretty much confirmed to be too low. Everyone who buys into China's numbers is relying on BS, which is dangerous. We have to wade through the official muck released by China in an effort to make the problem look insignificant. A member of WHO is China and the way it's being handled is incompetent.  


Comparing this disease with flu and dismissing it is incredibly stupid. This is a new virus with no cure and a higher mortality rate than the flu. It hasn't run its course and people are comparing yearly data from the past several decades against like TWO MONTHS of the coronavirus' existence. It isn't as established at the flu but is comparably infectious.   


You know how the flu deaths in the US works? And how many cases of actual flu there are? When someone comes in with a pre-existing condition and dies from the flu in the US, the death will be recorded as something like complication associated with influenza and such. In China, there's barely any recording. The population is massive, flu spreads like wildfire there, and the hygiene is terrible. China has more deaths from flu than US, it's just not recorded.  


Also, only 0.1% of flu patients actually need emergency care. We have vaccines for flu, the world is aware of it, and we have solutions. It's just that there are several millions of cases compared to the rough estamate of maybe 100k+ for coronavirus at the moment. If you have a mortality rate of 3% for the coronavirus while the mortality rate of flu is well under 1%, what do you think happens when the number of coronavirus victims becomes comparable to flu victims? You obviously will get a far greater number of deaths from the coronavirus. Some calculations based on the conservative yet incomplete data estimate the coronavirus is more than 100 times more lethal than the flu.  


With the coronavirus, the number of infected who need emergency care jumps to 1% according to the ""official"" numbers (so it's basically going to probably be even more). That is over 10x more than flu patients. You will have 10x more emergency care needed on top of existing emergency requirements. This will overload the medical system. 

Using the flu as a deflection is absolutely stupid."

Twenty-six potential Ontario cases of the novel coronavirus are under investigation, but the number of confirmed patients remains at three, Medical Officer of Health David Williams confirmed Monday.Another three cases under investigation are “presumptive negative,” or highly unlikely to be linked to the outbreak from Wuhan, China.

A total of 108 tests have been conducted to date on Ontarians.
The three confirmed patients — a woman in her 20s from London, and a husband and wife from Toronto — are all reported to be recovering well.

Provincial health officials will now work with their federal counterparts under a plan to bring Canadians requesting evacuation from China to the Canadian Forces Base in Trenton where they’ll stay for a two-week period.

Williams said initial discussions with the federal officials suggest that that period of observation will be mandatory, but that hasn’t been confirmed.

The size of the plane is also to be determined, he said.
“Some are adults, some are families, some are children,” he said. “They’re Canadian citizens that deserve care so we have to make sure that’s comprehensive and sensitive and proper at that time.”

Face masks have flown off some store shelves — one major retailer posted a sign last week advising that customers could only purchase four at one time — but Williams said for most people, it would be a personal choice to wear one as it’s not medically necessary.

Any rumours that novel coronavirus is widespread through Ontario are incorrect, he said.
“We have never said that,” Williams said. “It is not."

1. The flu is deadly and infectious AF. You better hope that nothing is nearly as bad as the flu.
2. The only reason the coronavirus hasn't killed as many people as the flu is because it hasn't spread as much, yet. Comparing death toll and recovery stats, ~40% of coronavirus cases so far have ended in deaths. The flu, on the other hand, has a death rate of basically 0%.

To say that the coronavirus is about as deadly as the flu is to say that AIDS is about as deadly as the flu. Yes, technically, very similar amounts of Americans die every year to both, but it's much more dangerous if you have it. And the coronavirus is much much more infectious than AIDS for the record."

""SARS and Wuhan viruses bind to the same distinctly shaped [protein receptors](https://jvi.asm.org/content/jvi/early/2020/01/23/JVI.00127-20.full.pdf) in the body that are expressed in the lungs and intestines, making these organs the primary targets for both viruses, said Fang Li, an associate professor of veterinary and biomedical sciences at the University of Minnesota.""

That has led to a run on face masks. But those may be of limited benefit in the event the virus is being transmitted via the fecal-oral route, said John Nicholls, a clinical professor of pathology at the University of Hong Kong.

Squat latrines lacking covers, common in China, and hands that aren’t washed thoroughly with soap and water after visiting the bathroom could be a source of virus transmission, said Nicholls, who was part of the research team that isolated and characterized the SARS virus.

A virus-laden aerosol plume emanating from a SARS patient with diarrhea was implicated in possibly hundreds of cases at the Amoy Gardens housing complex in 2003. That led Hong Kong researchers to understand the importance of the virus’s spread through the gastrointestinal tract and to recognize both the limitation of face masks and importance of cleanliness and hygiene, Nicholls said in an interview.

“I think in Wuhan, that would be a very likely place where you might get the transmission” from fecal material, he said. “If it’s using the same receptor as for SARS, I can’t see why it shouldn’t be replicating in the gut.”

Doctors have reported **diarrhea infrequently** in 2019-nCoV patients admitted to **Wuhan hospitals**, though it has been **more prominent among reported cases outside the city, including members of a Shenzhen family infected in Wuhan, and more recently in the first U.S. case in Washington state.** 

Many of the emerging coronaviruses are so-called pneumoenteric viruses, meaning they can **replicate both in the respiratory tract and the gastrointestinal system,** said Ralph Baric, professor of microbiology and immunology at the Gillings School of Global Public Health at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, who has studied coronaviruses for decades.

Overwhelmed by hundreds of severely sick pneumonia patients, doctors in Wuhan might not have focused on any gastric signs, Baric said in a phone interview.

“The Chinese are so overwhelmed at the moment and trying to do a combination of treating patients and dealing with the scope of the outbreak, and then trying to get out papers that describe what’s happening,” he said.

Any virus in stool is more likely to be present during the acute phase of an infection, occurring before hospitalized patients develop a life-threatening complication known as acute respiratory distress syndrome, Baric said.

“I have also spent most of my time focusing on the respiratory tract symptomology rather than the gut because of the relationship between these different emerging viruses and acute respiratory distress syndrome,” he said.

Zijian Feng, deputy director general of Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, and colleagues released a report Wednesday on the first 425 Wuhan cases, and noted that **early infections that didn’t appear to display typical signs — such as fever and viral pneumonia — or had mild symptoms might have been missed.**

“The initial focus of case detection was on patients with pneumonia, but we now understand that some patients can present with gastrointestinal symptoms,” Feng and co-authors said in their report, which was published in the New England Journal of Medicine.”
