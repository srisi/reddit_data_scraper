From WHO Feb 24:

> Routes of transmission
COVID-19 is transmitted via droplets and fomites during close unprotected contact between an infector and infectee. Airborne spread has not been reported for COVID-19 and it is not believed to be a major driver of transmission based on available evidence; however, it can be envisaged if certain aerosol-generating procedures are conducted in health care facilities. Fecal shedding has been demonstrated from some patients, and viable virus has been identified in a limited number of case reports. However, the fecal-oral route does not appear to be a driver of COVID-19 transmission; its role and significance for COVID-19 remains to be determined. 

https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/who-china-joint-mission-on-covid-19-final-report.pdf

From Johns Hopkins, today:

> Transmission COVID-19 might be spread through the airborne route

It's always incredible that Australia's housing bubble and bank reckless lending is just sorta shuffled away, mixed in with other things as though it wasn't a root cause.

I don't mean a cause, I mean a *root cause*, one from which a multitude of other problems stem.

This is from Bob Day, back in 2014. Fuck his politics but he's damn right on this:

>For more than 100 years, the average Australian family was able to buy its first home on one wage. Young couples got a start in the housing market and worked up from there. The median house price was around three times the median income, allowing young homebuyers easy entry into the housing market. **The median house price is now more than nine times what it was for 100 years between 1900 and 2000. At nine times median household income, a family will fork out approximately $600,000 more on mortgage payments than they would have had house prices remained at three times median income. That is $600,000 that they are not able to spend on other things—clothes, cars, furniture, appliances, travel, movies, restaurants, the theatre, their children’s education, charities and so on.** The economic consequences of this change have been devastating. The capital structure of our economy has been distorted to the tune of hundreds of billions of dollars. And for those on middle and low incomes, the prospect of ever becoming homeowners has now all but vanished. Housing starts have plummeted, and so have all the jobs associated with it—civil construction, housing construction, transport, appliances, whitegoods, soft furnishing, and the list goes on. That is not to mention the billions of dollars in lost GST revenue to the states.

This line ""The capital structure of our economy has been distorted to the tune of hundreds of billions of dollars"" is chilling. This is the banks. This is building unlivable concrete boxes in the sky for foreign money. This is other businesses in Australia going under because it is more profitable to own the land a business sits on than it is to run a business. This is why bank lending to business has dropped incredibly.

The toxin that is the housing bubble is everywhere. Every single time a person or couple takes on massive debt to buy a house, they stop spending in the economy. Your wage is my spending. My wage is your spending. 

It's not coronavirus or bushfire, not even drought.

It's the housing bubble. It is the prime mover that has fucked our economy and our future. It causes low wage growth... because businesses who can't make sales because their customers all have high mortgages can't raise wages. 

It has distorted business so badly in Australia that instead of developing top-notch exporting companies that just don't dig holes, we squash them out of existence. So then if China sneezes, we're fucked because guess what, we don't make medical equipment. We don't make films of any significance. We don't fund Bluey enough so they have to go outside the country for funding. 

Until housing is solved in Australia, we're fucked and that's the end of the story. 

Banks can still lend recklessly. Foreign students on visas can buy an established house... and then we don't bother checking if they sell it. Overseas money is still in our market and we don't introduce the anti-money laundering legislation that could put a stop it it. It's only been sitting on the high shelf for over a decade now.

We've spent so long selling houses to each other that it's what we have left now. Of course we're going to enter recession eventually. Even illegal foreign money isn't dumb enough to keep pushing prices up. 

The house that went from $198K twenty years ago to $1.98 million ain't going to $19.8 million in the next twenty years. It becomes mathematically impossible. No wage can support that.

The good new is that all bubbles break. No bubble has *not* broken. Sadly, our Government and ultimately us, treat the housing market as though it is uncontrollable, as though you should just stop complaining and get on with it.

If we restricted borrowing to three times your yearly income and explicitly tied wages to prices, we'd see the bubble die a quick death. 

But we're not going to do that, so down we all go."

* got our testing running early, and now hundreds of sites can test throughout the country at high volume
* have really great coordination between the city, county, state and federal levels
* have some plans on the drawing board for public investments and stimulus should they be neccessary
* are investing in helping less developed nations to combat the virus, because as the President stated - ""a virus does not recognize borders. We need to ensure that the global community is prepared to meet this challenge""

This election cycle, and every election cycle or politically charged time that has preceded it in our country, there has been an issue raised of ""civility."" Let me quickly state that I am all for civility if it is matched by both sides. This is an extremely rare phenomenon, but the liberals in this country would have you think it is always the case. When the antifascists (Antifa as they have become so fondly known as to erase the thing they are against from public perception) break windows, they are quickly dubbed ""domestic terrorists."" Black Lives Matter protestors are treated the same way. And these are the more radical examples in our country. A far cry from the direct action of these two groups is the campaign of Bernie Sanders. Yet even he and his supporters are accused of being ""uncivil"" for a lack of better criticism.

This is representative of a certain blindness or perhaps voluntary ignorance from liberals: ignorance of the violence embedded in the status quo. This violence is central to the American identity and has a strong monetary and social incentive to not be mentioned. Yet sometimes this violence becomes blatantly obvious, and if you are a keen observer it becomes dauntingly omnipresent as time passes. It is most visible in the stories of police brutality that we are exposed to every day. It is very obviously visible in every single ""foreign policy action"" the United States partakes in. Yet I'll try to provide some of the more ""invisible"" examples:

It is visible when President Obama has the audacity to fly out to Flint, Michigan, drink water for a photo op, and then leave the people to fall ill or pay thousands for the bare necessity that is water. It is visible when a few deaths from the novel Coronavirus that bring losses for the shareholders are publicized much more than the 20,000 daily (preventible) worldwide deaths from starvation will ever be. It is visible when the only black group in American history to ever arm themselves for self-defense based on their 2nd amendment rights are slaughtered by the FBI. It is visible when that same FBI injects minority neighborhoods with guns and drugs and then stars the ""war on drugs and crime"" which has become synonymous with the ""war on blacks and browns."" It is visible when the specter of slavery lives on through our prison system that incarcerates and exploits those same ""blacks and browns."" It is visible when even our ""Democratic"" leaders (e.g - Clintons) exploit those prisoners’ labor for their own gain, not unlike every capitalist in America. It is present when those same Democratic leaders and many more men in positions of socioeconomic power are able to get away with sexual harassment and assault. It is visible when both flavors of political party agree to send a $3 Billion stipend to Israel for the massacring of Palestinians. It is visible when companies like Nike present a theme of social justice and activism attached to their products that have been made through the exploitation of workers in the Asia-Pacific. It is present when every product we consume has in one way or another been touched by the exploitation of the third world that we perpetuate with our horrendously inflated military. It is visible when both parties reconcile their differences in order to continue funding said exploitation with >$700 Billion a year.

As soon as this injustice is exposed, claims of being ""uncivil"" rear their ugly head. Bernie Sanders for decades now has been one of the few to expose and challenge the status quo, going as far as being arrested at civil rights rallies that would certainly be deemed “uncivil” today. The people he represents have been the most touched by this violence and to demand their civility is to completely and utterly silence their voice. It is to say ""Hush! Your cries for freedom are inconveniencing me."" It is apparent that those who bask in the all-forgiving aura of the status quo don't have to apologize for the injustices I mentioned and many more. To support this status quo and demand civility from the same people you meet with deadly force and systematic oppression on a daily basis is laughably hypocritical, yet through manufactured discourse and punditry it has been made almost instinctual for the privileged.

To conclude, I'll expand upon one of my favorite quotes of all time from Rosa Luxemburg. ""Those who do not move, do not notice their chains."" And those who are priveleged enough to not have to move too often complain about the noise created by those yearning to be free from their chains."

For comparison, a 0.1% death rate for influenza versus a 3.4% death rate for COVID-19. That is pretty significant and higher than previously touted by a significant margin. Downplaying the risk this virus poses by comparing current deaths (with less than 100,000 people infected) to annual flu deaths (where millions are infected) need to stop. It's not a fair comparison.

It's not a time to panic -- but a time to be cognizant, compassionate, informed, orderly, and prepared. If this virus gets a strong foothold, we will need to be our best selves."

\- Spread has now become more likely, almost inevitable

\- Unknown when spread will occur, but we expect it is soon. We can only try to slow it down.

\- Travel restrictions, quarantine etc, have bought time so far. But that won't last.

\- When it occurs, they will begin actioning plans that are already in place. The focus must turn to reducing impact and helping to protect people.

\- People should begin to think about how they will respond when spread occurs. Have conversations with friends and families about how they will care for each other. Think about those around them who may be more vulnerable, such as the elderly or sick.

\- Make a plan for how you and your family and pets will manage if you need to stay home for 2-3 weeks

\- Stay at home now, ""if you will""

\- Practice good hand hygiene and cough etiquette, don't touch your face, and use objects to touch lift buttons

\- Wearing masks is not the best preventive measure. They do provide protection when used by those who are already sick.

\- Masks are a precious resource and should be reserved for frontline healthcare workers

\- Best public health advice tells us Coronavirus will be with us for a while

\- We will get through this by caring for and protecting ourselves and others"

Your odds of dying are 2-4% on average depending on your sources, closer to 15% if you're old, closer to 0 if you're young.  
  
2-4% death rates in an uncontrolled spread to flu like levels of infection (1 billion+ according to estimates) will result in millions of deaths.  
  
This small percent, large number dichotomy is the major cause of a lot of the issues.

1. Some countries have no capacity to test
2. Sometimes the testing methods and equipment have failed (this will normalize shortly)
3. Some countries are simply ignoring it (e.g. Indonesia)
4. An increasing amount of countries - developed and developing - are deciding to follow China's lead and hide the true numbers.  I assume they do this in attempts to reduce panic, to reduce economic impact, or to address domestic political problems.  Example countries are China, Japan, Thailand, now Korea, the US Fed-vs-States are arguing about how to censor, Australia etc

The problems I have with point 4 - intentional under-reporting

1. It will cause unnecessary deaths
2. It will cause distrust in government, meaning when government needs to tell people important information in the future people may disregard it
3. It will make it much harder for markets to properly price the costs of the virus, which means we will get larger fluctuations.  This isn't some ""oh no the money"" argument - this relates to companies making the correct decisions to get through the next few months, and if they can't trust the core data then they can't properly make hiring/firing decisions, inventory decisions, etc.  Which really just translates to more lay-offs."

Admittedly, I was at the front of the plane (row 6) and the majority of the altercation took place in the back, but I'll share what happened from my perspective. From what I can tell, this had nothing to do with the coronavirus and was solely due to the dog. As we were boarding, the lady with the dog approached the flight attendant next to me and asked if she can keep the dog in her lap, as she apparently had an open seat for the dog on her last flight. The attendant told her that she needed to put the dog under the seat, and returned to her seat. We began to taxi, and after like 20 min of driving around we returned to the gate. Everyone was confused, and the attendants refused to tell anyone what was going on. We sat there for like 40 min before they opened the doors and let in a medic, who went to the back of the plane, and escorted the lady with the dog off the flight. We sat there for another 20 or 30 min while they did some paperwork (according to the attendant) up front. Finally, the attendant made an announcement that they had an issue with a passenger where she refused to put the small dog underneath the seat for takeoff, and had to be escorted off the plane. 

The only distasteful comments I heard came from an old man seated behind me after she was escorted off. It was something to the tune of, ""what's with these Asians and their small dogs?"" 

Again, I was seated in the front of the plane so I probably don't have the complete story, but from what I heard this was all about the dog. Just thought I should share what I experienced."

Age 20-29 = 0.2%

Age 30-39 = 0.2%

Age 50-59 = 1.3%

Age 60-69 = 3.6%

Age 70-79 = 8.0%

> I have been drawn to the vision & electricity of [@ewarren](https://twitter.com/ewarren) and the policy record of [@MikeBloomberg](https://twitter.com/MikeBloomberg) on guns/climate. But I voted today for [@JoeBiden](https://twitter.com/JoeBiden). Here’s why: 

&#x200B;

> The foundations of a progressive policy platform are empathy and decency, which [@JoeBiden](https://twitter.com/JoeBiden) embodies to a truly rare extent. These qualities are also the antithesis of the narcissism and cruelty of [@realDonaldTrump](https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump). The contrast will be stark. 

&#x200B;

> .[@JoeBiden](https://twitter.com/JoeBiden) is running not to go back in time or to “unite” w/ a [@GOP](https://twitter.com/GOP) that now cares more about itself than the country. He is running to bring America to a place where we care for one another, where everyone is seen and included & where government has your back when you stumble. 

&#x200B;

> During the [@BarackObama](https://twitter.com/BarackObama) admin, I was stunned to learn something [@JoeBiden](https://twitter.com/JoeBiden) never advertised: when he meets someone who’s suffered great personal loss, he gives them his personal cell #. “If you feel low & have no place to turn, call me,” he says. Grieving strangers cld call [@VP](https://twitter.com/VP). 

&#x200B;

> People see themselves in [@JoeBiden](https://twitter.com/JoeBiden) and he practices what his dad preached to him: “Joey, nobody’s better than you and you’re better than nobody.” Biden’s reflexive devotion to dignity and equality are what caused him to lead the Obama admin to the right place on same-sex marriage 

&#x200B;

>[@JoeBiden](https://twitter.com/JoeBiden) understands what [@SherrodBrown](https://twitter.com/SherrodBrown) calls the “dignity of work.” When people lose their jobs, when they can’t earn a living wage, when nothing they do allows them to make ends meet, that is a violation of something primal: a desire for agency, self-sufficiency and dignity. 

&#x200B;

> When his beloved son Beau served in Iraq, [@JoeBiden](https://twitter.com/JoeBiden) says he saw what the poet John Milton meant when he wrote, “They also serve who only stand and wait.” The human stakes of foreign policy decision making are visceral to Biden. His connection w/ military families is personal. 

&#x200B;

> In the campaign b4 [\#SouthCarolina](https://twitter.com/hashtag/SouthCarolina?src=hashtag_click), [@JoeBiden](https://twitter.com/JoeBiden) maybe overrelied on the arg that he had already negotiated w/ world leaders & wd have them on speed dial on Day1. But [\#coronavirus](https://twitter.com/hashtag/coronavirus?src=hashtag_click) reminds us of the indispensability of 1) experience and 2) being able to galvanize global cooperation 

&#x200B;

> Much more to say, but I must mention [@DrBiden](https://twitter.com/DrBiden) who could have done anything with her life, but chose to teach at community college. She will make one hell of a First Lady."

2020-03-03,skeebidybop,Coronavirus,17,https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/fczrqa/us_the_official_coronavirus_numbers_are_wrong_and/fje1c24/,">We know, irrefutably, one thing about the coronavirus in the United States: The number of cases reported in every chart and table is far too low.

>The data are untrustworthy because the processes we used to get them were flawed. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s testing procedures missed the bulk of the cases. They focused exclusively on travelers, rather than testing more broadly, because that seemed like the best way to catch cases entering the country.

>Just days ago, it was not clear that the virus had spread solely from domestic contact at all. But then cases began popping up with no known international connection. What public-health experts call “community spread” had arrived in the United States. The virus would not be stopped by tight borders, because it was already propagating domestically. Trevor Bedford’s lab at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in Seattle, which studies viral evolution, concluded there is “firm evidence” that, at least in Washington State, the coronavirus had been spreading undetected for weeks. Now different projections estimate that 20 to 1,500 people have already been infected in the greater Seattle area. In California, too, the disease appears to be spreading, although the limited testing means that no one is quite sure how far.

>In total, fewer than 500 people have been tested across the country (although the CDC has stopped reporting that number in its summary of the outbreak). As a result, the current “official” case count inside the United States stood at 43 as of Tuesday morning (excluding cruise ship cases). This number is wrong, yet it’s still constantly printed and quoted. In other contexts, we’d call this what it is: a subtle form of misinformation.


>This artificially low number means that for the past few weeks, we’ve seen massive state action abroad and only simmering unease domestically. While Chinese officials were enacting a world-historic containment effort—putting more than 700 million people under some kind of movement restriction, quarantining tens of millions of people, and placing others under new kinds of surveillance—and American public-health officials were staring at the writing on the wall that the disease was extremely likely to spread in the U.S., the public-health response was stuck in neutral. The case count in the U.S. was not increasing at all. Preparing for a sizable outbreak seemed absurd when there were fewer than 20 cases on American soil. Now we know that the disease was already spreading and that it was the U.S. response that was stalled.

>Meanwhile, South Korean officials have been testing more than 10,000 people a day, driving up the country’s reported-case count. Same goes for Italy: high test rate, high number of cases. (Now
some Italian politicians want to restrict testing.) In China, the official data say the country has more than 80,000 cases, but the real number might be far, far higher because of all the people who had mild(er) cases and were turned away from medical care, or never sought it in the first place. That may be cause for reassurance (though not everyone agrees), because the total number of cases is the denominator in the simple equation that yields a fatality rate: deaths divided by cases. More cases with the same number of deaths means that the disease is likely less deadly than the data show.

>The point is that every country’s numbers are the result of a specific set of testing and accounting regimes. Everyone is cooking the data, one way or another. And yet, even though these inconsistencies are public and plain, people continue to rely on charts showing different numbers, with no indication that they are not all produced with the same rigor or vigor. This is bad. It encourages dangerous behavior such as cutting back testing to bring a country’s numbers down or slow-walking testing to keep a country’s numbers low.

>The other problem is, now that the U.S. appears to be ramping up testing, the number of cases will grow quickly. Public-health officials are currently cautioning people not to worry as that happens, but it will be hard to disambiguate what proportion of the ballooning number of cases is the result of more testing and what proportion is from the actual spread of the virus.
People trust data. Numbers seem real. Charts have charismatic power. People believe what can be quantified. But data do not always accurately reflect the state of the world. Or as one scholar put it in a book title: “Raw Data” Is an Oxymoron.

>The reality gap between American numbers and American cases is wide. Regular citizens and decision makers cannot rely on only the numbers to make decisions. Sometimes quantification actually obscures as much as it reveals."

>Take extra care to wash your hands frequently, it's very easy to be in contact with a lot of people and touch your face/eyes/nose--try not to do that. Make sure your hands are clean before you put them on your face. 
 Disinfect surfaces around the home, take extra care now. You want to do this anyway, it's the peak of flu season. We want to make sure that people cover their mouth and nose when they cough or sneeze. Take it on a case-by-case basis. We're not telling people to change their life any way at this point, just telling them to be more careful and to pay attention when you yourself, or a member of your family, is sick. Stay home, don't go out, don't be around other people."

OMG these Fluers are killing me

Ok ok. Let’s just think about this nice and slow. Ok ok. So the flu is taxing on the population already right? So then What if something new came along that could kill as many as the “regular” flu could but that wasn’t the “regular flu???.... if this were the case, you would then double current deaths. So this years deaths so far @ 10,000 in the USA would become 20,000. So then ..... think about if this new “flu” (which it’s not a flu) was slightly more deadly at a 2% fatality rate as compared to  the “regular” flu fatality rate at around .1 - .2%. 

This would mean the “new” flu aka Coronavirus if as wide spread as the flu (which it totally is but you can’t see that Becuase you or a loved one hasn’t gotten it) it would mean 100,000 people could be dead right now as compared to the 10,000 so far in this years reference. 

Ok ok. Even if it’s not 2% maybe 1% the US health system would easily be flooded and overwhelmed by it.

FYI there are roughly 150,000 ICU beds in America (that are required for many many many reasons not just flu or Coronavirus). That’s it folks. Wanna see how many people get pneumonia and need icu now?"

The number of people in Iran infected by the coronavirus surged past 2,300, the death toll rose to 77, and the country’s head of Parliament said that nearly two dozen lawmakers had tested positive and should avoid meeting with members of the public, the authorities announced on Tuesday.

The new tallies were reported as the judiciary, apparently hoping to minimize the risk of contagion in Iran’s penal system, said it had temporarily freed more than 54,000 prisoners considered to be symptom-free. But it was unclear from the announcement how many of the prisoners had actually been tested, given the shortage of testing equipment in Iran.

Gholamhossein Esmaili, a judiciary spokesman, who announced the prisoner releases, did not specify whether any of the reported cases or deaths so far have included prisoners.

Iran now has 2,336 reported cases, more than any country other than China and South Korea, and 11 more people have died, according to figures cited by the deputy health minister, Alireza Raisi, on state TV.

State news media reported on Tuesday that Ahmad Toysarkani, an adviser to the judiciary, was among those who had died. The virus has been felt at the highest levels of Iranian society, with Masoumeh Ebtekar, the president’s deputy for women’s affairs and the highest-ranking woman in the government, among those who have become infected.

Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, the supreme leader, was pictured in state news media wearing plastic gloves, and he told the Iranian people to follow medical advice to help combat the outbreak, saying anything that “facilitates its spread is a sin.”"

2020-03-03,artwrangler,Coronavirus,14,https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/fd2ii5/opinion_how_to_survive_a_coronavirus_quarantine/fjel093/,"To prevent the spread of the coronavirus, thousands of people worldwide have been put into quarantine — some voluntarily, in the comfort of their own homes, others in makeshift barracks with armed guards, or in hotels, or on cruise ships. Their plans are upended, the future is uncertain, and for most of us, no matter how rational we think we are about risk, no matter how calm we imagine we will be in a crisis, that’s a recipe for freaking out.

Ask me how I know.

In June 2009, my husband and I flew to Beijing with our three kids, then 3, 5 and 7, and my mother to adopt another daughter, also 3. We planned a few days to get acclimated before traveling to our new daughter’s foster home, but on our second day there, after a visit to the gardens at Beihai Park, my husband’s Blackberry rang. It was a representative of the Chinese government, asking us to return to our hotel room immediately.

It turned out that the family in the row in front of us on the airplane over had tested positive for H1N1 — swine flu. What that meant, in China in 2009, was that we could expect to be tested, too, and then either hospitalized or moved to a quarantine facility.

We wouldn’t be the only Americans in that situation — we had heard rumors that the mayor of New Orleans and his wife were guests of the Chinese government, along with an entire marching band from California — but according to the U.S. Embassy, we would be the only family with young children in tow. The American officials did not know how that would be handled, but we were asked to cooperate, and we did.

I have been using the verb “asked.” It is accurate, but only up to a point. We were “asked” at every stage, but there were no alternatives. And I say we “cooperated,” and that is also accurate, but it’s too quiet a word for our disbelieving reaction. It sounds terrible now — the opposite of what you would expect from a good global citizen — but we argued. We tried to negotiate, to bargain. How could this be happening? But it was.

In our defense, we were frightened, about our health, and about our kids’. And we were angry, not at China, exactly, but at fate.

My husband tested positive for the flu and was padlocked into a hospital room. The rest of us sat out a heat wave on the outskirts of Beijing in what had once been an opulent resort for high-ranking Communist officials and was now essentially a ruin, a guard with a gun at the entrance.

We spoke no Mandarin and had to guess at what was expected of us. Two young women with serious faces showed us to our rooms. They opened one door for my 7-year-old and another for my mother, seeming to expect each member of the family to separate. But no one objected when I kept both younger children in my arms and walked into only one room. They gave me keys. They pointed to bottles of water. And then they walked away. The minute their footsteps disappeared down the hall my 7-year-old rushed into my room, crying. I pulled him in before anyone could see. There was a hole in the wall, he said, and mold all around it, and he was scared. So was I.

Did I say scared? I was terrified.

It’s the fear that I remember most vividly. It wasn’t just that I didn’t understand what we were supposed to do; it was that I didn’t know what was going to happen. Could we leave our rooms? Would we get in trouble if they found us all in here together? What if I got sick? What if the children got sick? Would they be taken away from me? How long until we could go home?

I did leave my room. I couldn’t keep still. I remember chasing the one English-speaking official into his office and cornering him, trying to force him to walk through all the possibilities with me, as though by naming them, I could bend them to my will. He shook his head, refusing to answer, and finally got up and left, waving off the crazy woman who couldn’t just accept that we were both at the mercy of events neither of us could control. How, the look on his face demanded, had I reached adulthood without ever learning to accept that sometimes, you just have to ride the waves?

Quarantine is one of the many waiting rooms of life, and its own special circle of hell for people raised with the illusion that we control our destinies. We prefer to believe that anything can be overcome if we just try hard enough. But there is no trying in quarantine. There is only the sitting, and, if you wish to retain your hold on your sanity, the letting go. What comes next? No one knows. That’s why we have quarantine in the first place.

By Day 4, I had stopped chasing the English-speaking official or frantically calling the embassy. The answer to every question I asked was “it depends,” and the one thing it did not depend on was me.

We began to follow the lead of the people around us, all Chinese nationals. We wore our masks to meals and took walks around the courtyard in the evenings, keeping our distance from the other inmates. (One does not fraternize in quarantine, even if one speaks the language.)

As the days slowly passed, we slid into a routine of cold showers and laying very still on the tile floor in between the twice-daily fever checks, trying to decipher the cartoons on TV.

“Why do you think that plate is floating in the air over the sheep?” someone would ask, and we would contemplate this, yet another of the mysteries of our new life.

My husband recovered from the flu and returned to the hotel, but as potential incubators we had to keep waiting. The English-speaking official, once I stopped trying to pin him down, began trying to make us more comfortable. We were each given a single, ice-cold Coke each day, and an acquaintance was allowed to send us a supply of Pringles in unexpected flavors: shrimp, crab, Hong Kong Fish Ball. My mother, who had stolen all the instant Nescafé from the hotel on the night they came to take us away, figured out how to make iced coffee.

At last, after 10 symptom-free days, we were told we could leave. With the taxi on the way, I beckoned my oldest son into the hallway. “Bring the Pringles,” I said.

We walked up and down. Behind every door was someone in the middle of the same uncertain journey we had just taken, their only advantage that they, at least, could understand the cartoon about the sheep. I wanted to give one person something else to think about.

“Listen for a family with kids,” I whispered to my son, and he pointed to a door. That one.

“Get ready to run,” I told him, this kid who had never played Ding Dong Dash in his entire sheltered life. We put the Pringles down in front of the door, and I knocked hard, then grabbed his hand, and we tore off toward the stairwell.

We never found out if our fellow sufferers enjoyed their Pringles. It is estimated that somewhere between 11 and 21 percent of the global population was infected with the virus during the pandemic, and that more than 284,000 people died. A vaccine was developed. New cases decreased. The world moved on.

We had been lucky. We were quarantined. Then we weren’t. And there was never, at any moment, anything I could do about it."

**Headline:** ""Ferrarigate"": Mercedes mobilises with letter against Ferrari

Already on Friday evening (i.e. on the day of the FIA broadcast) an insider announced to 'Motorsport-Total.com' that the FIA broadcast would probably not be the end of the fraud affair for a long time, but only the ""beginning of a very lengthy process"".

This seems to be confirmed now.

In the podcast 'Starting Grid' as well as in the parallel published background video with editor-in-chief Christian Nimmervoll it was already explained at the weekend that (and why) the former thaw between Ferrari and Mercedes has meanwhile become ""Cold War"" again. A picture that coincides with what is now happening behind the scenes.

As 'F1-insider.com' reports, Mercedes team boss Toto Wolff has ""sent a letter to all non-Ferrari teams in Formula 1 (i.e. everyone except Ferrari, Alfa Romeo, Haas) to take joint action against the private agreement that the automobile association has made with Ferrari"".

The plan is apparently to jointly put pressure on the FIA and Ferrari to make public the details of the sharply criticized ""horse-trading"" about which silence had initially been agreed.

There are no two opinions in the industry that Ferrari has left the legal area in the field of drive technology in 2019. But the fact that this is to be swept under the carpet is driving many a Ferrari competitor to white heat.

Whether Wolff will succeed in getting all six other teams to sign his letter is currently unknown.

But even if, contrary to expectations, one or the other should not go along, one thing is certain: The pressure on the FIA not to let Ferrari get away so easily will continue to increase in the next days and weeks.

There are still no official statements from other teams about this sensitive matter. Which is not surprising with such a topic.

But if the season opener in Australia will take place as planned (despite the coronavirus), the first FIA press conference of the year 2020 on Thursday in Melbourne could be a very, very interesting affair ..."

The claim is that the US is fucked because it isn’t actually testing. I was skeptical because I thought sick people are being tested and there just aren’t that many sick people so there’s less testing. 

But something just doesn’t add up about these numbers. If the US has one of the better health care systems in the world, then why would the US have a 9% fatality rate when the rest of the world is at 2%?

I’m guessing you all are right and there are way more cases here than we know about. 

Which is real bad news if true.

Edit: just to clarify, I don’t mean the US health care system is one of the better ones in the world in terms of affordability and accessibility. Just in terms of education, resources, and sophistication. Many countries have excellent hospitals too, but compared with places like Iran, Italy, China, and Korea, it’s better in the US."

A Westchester County man may have exposed doctors, nurses and others to the coronavirus at a local hospital, officials said.  The authorities confirmed on Tuesday a second case of coronavirus in New York, a man in his 50s who lives in Westchester County, just outside New York City, suggesting that the virus may well have been spreading locally, and until now, undetected.

The man initially went to a hospital in Westchester about four or five days ago, before it was confirmed he had the virus, the authorities said, acknowledging that he may have exposed doctors, nurses and others to the illness.

“We believe that a couple of the medical professionals have been quarantined,” George Latimer, a Westchester County executive, said at a news conference, adding that state health officials were examining “what exposure might exist” to the staff at that medical facility, the NewYork-Presbyterian Lawrence Hospital in Bronxville, N.Y.

The patient has since been transferred to a Manhattan hospital. He is a lawyer who lives in New Rochelle and works in Manhattan. He had not traveled to any of the areas that are known hubs of transmission for the virus, which was first identified in China in late December and has since [spread around the world](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/world/coronavirus-maps.html).

Health authorities in New York are now scrambling to try to trace the chain of transmission in both directions. They are trying to learn how he was infected and who might have been infected because of him.

“City and State disease detectives are working closely to identify close contacts and the appropriate next steps,” Mayor Bill de Blasio of New York said in a statement.

Two of the man’s children have links to New York City. One child attends a Jewish high school in Riverdale, which was closed on Tuesday as a precaution. The other, a college student in the city who officials believed lives on campus, has exhibited symptoms associated with the illness. Both of them have been quarantined and are being tested for coronavirus, according to Mr. de Blasio.

“Yes, people are going to get infected,” the governor, a Democrat, said in an interview on Long Island News Radio, adding that “80 percent self-resolve,” referring to the estimated recovery rate for mild or asymptomatic cases. Mr. Cuomo said the new patient had an underlying respiratory illness and is now at NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital in the city. The mayor’s office said he was in “serious condition.”

“The real issue is how many people will get seriously ill,” Mr. Cuomo said. “How many people, God forbid, could lose their lives.”

There were crucial differences between [the first case in New York](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/01/nyregion/new-york-coronvirus-confirmed.html), which came to light on Sunday, and the second.

The first coronavirus patient is a woman, 39, who began showing symptoms after returning home from Iran — currently the center of the outbreak in the Middle East. Health officials do not believe she was yet contagious when she flew home. And she came into contact with few people other than her husband and the driver who picked her up from the airport, health officials said.

With that first case, the source of infection — a foreign country — was known, and the authorities were hopeful that she had not spread the virus to other New Yorkers. “We don’t believe she was contagious when she was exposed to other people,” Mr. Cuomo said. But the second case appears different. The authorities do not know how the man became ill. Though he traveled recently to Miami, he is not known to have traveled abroad or to any areas with widespread transmission. For New York, this means the new coronavirus can no longer be thought of as an external threat that has yet to arrive.

Epidemiologists say that the increase in cases should come as little surprise, given how few people have been tested. In New York City, [fewer than 20 people](https://www1.nyc.gov/site/doh/health/health-topics/coronavirus.page) had been tested; across the state only a few dozen people have.

The city’s public health laboratory confirmed his case on its first day of being allowed to test for coronavirus, the mayor’s office said.

“With the results confirmed within a number of hours, we were immediately able to take next steps to stop the spread of this virus,” the statement said.

Testing procedures changed over the weekend, when the state’s public health laboratory in Albany, Wadsworth Center, began administering coronavirus tests after receiving permission from the federal government.

Previously, health authorities could not test patients locally and had to send samples to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta, limiting the number of people tested.

The governor said the state was also monitoring two families in the Buffalo area who had recently traveled to Italy, one of the centers of Europe’s outbreaks. On Monday night, acting on a proposal by Mr. Cuomo, the State Legislature [approved a $40 million emergency aid package ](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/26/nyregion/coronavirus-new-york-cuomo.html)to help the State Department of Health hire additional staff and equipment to help track and fight the disease. The governor said he would sign that bill on Tuesday, and he expected that additional measures to mitigate the disease could be necessary.

“Quarantine is going to have to be done,” Mr. Cuomo said. “All of these things could very well happen.”

He added that the State University of New York system was deciding whether to ask students abroad to return home.Also on Tuesday, two schools in the New York City area were closed for “precautionary measures” — the SAR Academy and SAR High School in the Riverdale neighborhood of the Bronx, and Westchester Day School in Mamaroneck, N.Y. 

Mr. Cuomo said during a news conference on Tuesday that one of the Westchester patient’s children attended SAR, which stands for Salanter Akiba Riverdale and describes itself as a Modern Orthodox Jewish day school.

The school, which has more than 1,400 students, sent an email to parents and faculty saying it was canceling classes on Tuesday because of a “suspected case of coronavirus.” Administrators urged parents and staff to remain calm and follow advised preventive measures.

Representatives for SAR declined to comment further, referring questions to the State Department of Health. The Westchester Day School, a private Jewish day school, closed over an “abundance of caution,” said Rachel Goldman, the school’s executive director.

Ms. Goldman said that the school did not have any reason to believe that any of its students, faculty or staff had coronavirus, but that it had opted to close when it learned that a person in one of the school’s feeder communities was suspected of contracting the virus.

That person, Ms. Goldman said, did not have any children who attended the school.

Following reports of price gouging on items like face masks and hand sanitizers, state Senator Brad Hoylman, a Democrat, said he would introduce a bill on Tuesday to penalize businesses that raised prices on medical supplies by more than 10 percent during a public health emergency.

“It’s said that after the storm come the vultures, and that’s exactly what could happen here if we don’t act now,” Mr. Hoylman said, adding, “Profiting off fear of disease is unconscionable.”"

Hello.  The following message was posted on a private Mensa message board called M2M.  It was posted on February 26th 2020, originally written by a man named James Robb.  He gave permission for his message to be shared, so here it is verbatim:

""Dear Colleagues, as some of you may recall, when I was a professor of pathology at the University of California San Diego, I was once the first molecular virologists in the world to work on coronaviruses (the 1970s).  I was the first to demonstrate the number of genes the virus contained.  Since then, I have kept up with the coronavirus field and its multiple clinical transfers into the human population (e.g., SARS, MERS) from different animal sources.

The current projections for its expansion in the U.S. are only probable, due to continued insufficient wordwide data, but it is most likely to be widespread in the U.S. by mid to late March and April.

Here is what I have done and the precautions that I take and will take.  These are the same precautions I currently used during our influenza seasons, except for the masks and gloves:

1. NO HANDSHAKING!  Use a fist bump, slight bow, elbow bump, etc.
2. Use ONLY your knuckle to touch light switches, elevator buttons, etc.  Lift the gasoline dispenser with a paper towel, or use a disposable glove.
3. Open doors with your closed fist or hip – do not grasp the handle with your hand, unless there is no other way to open the door.  Especially important on bathroom and post office/commercial doors.
4. Use disinfectant wipes at the store when they are available, including wiping the handle and child seat in grocery carts.
5. Wash your hands with soap for 10-20 seconds and/or use a greater than 60% alcohol based hand sanitizer whenever you return home from ANY activity that involves locations where other people have been.
6. Keep a bottle of sanitizer available at each of your home's entrances.  AND in your car for use after getting gas or touching other contaminated objects when you can't immediately wash your hands.
7. If possible, cough or sneeze into a disposable tissue and discard.  Use your elbow only if you have to.  The clothing on your elbow will contain infectious virus that can be passed on for up to a week or more!

What I have stocked in preparation for the pandemic spread to the U.S.:

1. Latex or nitrile latex disposable gloves for use when going shopping, using the gasoline pump, and all other outside activity when you come in contact with contaminated areas.

Note: This virus is spread in large droplets by coughing and sneezing.  This means the air will not infect you!  BUT all the surfaces where these droplets land are infectious for about a week on average – everything that is associated with infected people will be contaminated and potentially infectious.  The virus is on surfaces and you will not be infected unless your unprotected face is directly coughed or sneezed upon.  The virus only has cell receptors for lung cells (it only infects your lungs).  The only way for the virus to infect you is through your nose or mouth via your hands or an infected cough or sneeze onto or into your nose or mouth.

2) Stock up now with disposable surgical masks and use them to prevent you from touching your nose and/or mouth.  (We touch our nose/mouth 90X/day without knowing it!) This is the only way the virus can infect you – it is lung-specific.  The mask will not prevent the virus in a direct sneeze from getting into your nose or mouth – it is only to keep you from touching your nose or mouth.

3) Stock up now with hand sanitizers and latex/nitrile gloves (get the appropriate sizes for your family).  The hand sanitizers must be alcohol based and greater than 60% alcohol to be effective.

4) Stock up now with zinc lozenges.  These lozenges have been proven to be effective against coronavirus (and most other viruses) from multiplying in your throat and nasopharynx.  Use as directed several times a day when you begin to feel ANY cold like symptoms beginning.  It is best to lie down and let the lozenge dissolve in the back of your throat and nasopharynx.  Cold-Eeze is one brand available, but there are other brands available.""

(I'm omitting the next couple of paragraphs because they don't contain any advice and he just says some scary things about how he thinks the virus will likely spread.  He concludes with the following:)

""I hope these personal thoughts will be helpful during this potentially catastrophic pandemic.  You are welcome to share this e-mail.

Good luck to all of us!  Jim

2020-03-03,TRFilune,Anxiety,12,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/eupik4/coronavirus_megathread/fjefio3/,"Day 2: Corona Boogaloo.

Hey folks, here's me, coming with a 2nd day update from Torrejon de Ardoz. I have been checking on the Doctor today to check on my raspy throat, but no flu or anything. Just a mild case of Pharingitis, or however it's spelled. Damn you, Corona-Chan, you disappoint me again. It did surprise me to see my doctor attending me with gloves and a facemask on, but at the same time, he wasnt attending me in a full Hazmat suit, so that's reassuring.

First off, some news from over here in Spain. We got our oficial first death in Spain from Coronavirus. However, this is the most curious part of this. The dead patient died on February 13th from an unknown Pneumonia, according to El Pais. We got confirmation that it was because of the Coronavirus.

The theories of some of the people in this subreddit seem to be gaining weight. The report of the Seattle Flu Team does line up with this case too. The virus has been in Spain for a long time. Hell, it probably got here in January anyways. We just don't know much more besides of that, other than he was a 69 year old man, so he was considered part of the risk group, overall. 

Currently, life still goes on. It just has to, no matter what. Before I close this daily update, I want to call some people out on their constant references to the movie 'Contagion'. A lot of people like to quote that movie as a proof that the governments are lying and hiding info from us, that it is much worse than we oficially know. However, never forget that the film has an embodiment of the damage that social media, conspiracy theorism, and flatout misinformation can cause. Remember that the character of Adam Krumwiede, a slimeball of a 'journalist' who promoted homeopathic cures like 'Forsythia', exist in that movie.

Overall, keep tabs with the information provided by local authorities and the CDC if need be. And I know what i'll be doing today to clear my mind: playing Total War Warhammer 2, as Clan Skryre, as part of the Skaven!

To all of you people who are reading this, keep being awesome, keep researching this virus, and we'll find a way to beat this fucker into the ground. Keep calm, and carry on."

I, as many others do, hope that this pandemic will be reasonably contained, BUT I personally do not think it will be. Humans have never seen this snake-associated virus before and have no internal defense against it. Tremendous worldwide efforts are being made to understand the molecular and clinical virology of this virus. Unbelievable molecular knowledge about the genomics, structure, and virulence of this virus has already been achieved. BUT, there will be NO drugs or vaccines available this year to protect us or limit the infection within us. Only symptomatic support is available.

I hope these personal thoughts will be helpful during this potentially catastrophic pandemic. Good luck to all of us

The next step is to move the infected people out of their homes and into these field hospitals as long as they have mild condition. Serious and critical condition patients only in real hospitals. The hospitals will be reorganized so that some of them will be dedicated to COVID-19 and cleared of all other patients, thus making isolation easier and reduce cross contamination since you will no longer need isolation wards, the entire hospital becomes a red zone.

Field hospitals / cubical hospitals have very low doctor/nurse to patient ratio (something like 300 patients to a doctor), as patients are expected to mostly take care of themselves and fight the infection off on their own. The nurses are only there to monitor them and get them to a real hospital if their condition turn serious."

How serious an issue is this? I don't see the action to back up concerns.

I see stories on shortage of supply. I have yet to see grand campaigns to pull the public into action to fight a common enemy -- the virus.

Nothing brings people together like a challenge. You may have noticed one of the easiest times to break the ice and make friends is right after a really tough exam in a class you've taken. Coronavirus provides a ready made enemy to wrestle with, that conveniently does not require the usual bloodshed.

We've got a slow moving disaster ready made for the type of problems humans are great at solving.

In each country impacted public works campaigns should be organized to provide options for volunteer labor to contribute to emergency response. Rapid spin-up of manufacturing lines to crank out needed goods.

Could be a world GDP boosting effort to not necessarily increase it but reduce overall economic impact.

Reports indicate 300 victims in Qom, 215 in Tehran, 70 in Rasht, 12 in Lahijan, 6 in Astaneh, 60 in Mashhad, 43 in Isfahan, 23 in Kashan, 10 in Dastgerd, 54 in Gorgan, 45 in Arak, 45 in Kermanshah, 38 in Shiraz, 39 in Karaj, 23 in Khorramabad, 20 in Qazvin, 10 in Zahedan, 16 in Iranshahr, 12 in Boushehr,  and more than 100 in Mazandaran province have lost their lives.

Several others have died in other cities including Ardabil, Zanjan, Khorramdareh, Saqqez, Baneh, Azadshahr, Gonbad, Chaypareh, Urmia, Ilam, Samaleh, Salehshahr, Mahshahr, Ahvaz, Andimeshk, Sarbandar, Tabriz, Bonab, Saveh, Zarand, Qods, Najafabad, Homayounshahr, Kiashahr, Amlash, Siahkal, Yasuj, Malayer, Hamedan, Neyshabur, Kashmar, Eslamabad-e-Gharb, Nowshahr, Sorkheh Hesar, Semnan, Shahroud, Yazd, Buin Zahra, Takestan, and Bandar Abbas. Several activists and members of Resistance Units affiliated with the People’s Mujahideen (PMOI/MEK), who rushed to aid infected compatriots, are among the victims.

The rapid virus outbreak in Iran and its transmission to other countries around the world is the result of weeks-long cover-ups, lies, and misleading information to the public. But Khamenei brazenly said, “this is not such a big catastrophe, and we have had bigger ones."" This is a "" passing issue"" and nothing ""exceptional"". He continued, ""Our officials have been informing the public since the first day with confidence, honesty, and transparency and have kept the public informed, but some other countries where the virus outbreak is more severe and epidemic are hiding the problem."" Yesterday, Ali Rabiei, one of IRGC henchmen, and a spokesman for Rouhani, claimed that the Iranian regime had the most transparent approach to Corona.

Masoud Pezeshkian, first deputy speaker of regime’s parliament, and former health minister admitted, ""We should have quarantined Qom from day one... this disease is not a joke, the way we are dealing with it."" “Hospitals are overflowing and there is no room for more patients, and it will get worse day by day. The economy and everything will be ruined, it is no joke. What would have happened if they shut down the country for 15 days? (referring to the first outbreak in the city of Qom). If we did it the first day, it would not have spread to the entire country.” He added, “The numbers given are not real, because a number of patients have no symptoms. We find 95 people and two die, then we say 2 have died out of a 100, while it may be that only 2% of 10,000 have died” Pezeshkian said.

Bahram Parsai, a regime parliamentarian said today, ""The reality is beyond the statistics... and if the world does not rush to the aid of our selfless doctors and medical staff, we will all lose."" Resalat newspaper close to Khamenei wrote: ""We can’t just give false assurances and deny a virus outbreak until February 19, (the day before regime’s election) and then suddenly start beating on the drum about how dangerous Corona is and the possibility of spreading across the country only the day after."" Ebtekar daily’s ran an editorial on March 2, 2020, admitting, ""What makes each of these crises more critical and more catastrophic is the loss of the public’s trust.""

Mrs. [Maryam Rajavi](https://www.ncr-iran.org/en/news/maryam-rajavi/14237-maryam-rajavi), the president-elect of [the National Council of Resistance of Iran (NCRI)](https://ncr-iran.org/en/alternative), referring to Khamenei’s disgraceful comment, said, “The only thing that matters for this regime and its officials is to keep their grip on power.

I was curious so I walked over to the voting site near me.  The line was about as long as it was when I passed by there earlier.  I looked and there was no line inside the store, so about a 45 minute wait.

Also saw that Travis County has 822,000 registered voters which represents 95% of all persons eligible to vote.

On a percentage basis, Travis beat the other top 4 cities in people who early voted. (This info is from the state's website.)

- Harris County (Houston) - 10.78%
- Dallas County (Dallas) - 10.09%
- Tarrant County (Fort Worth) - 11.89%
- Bexar County (an Antonio) - 12.13%
- Travis County (Austin) - 15.99%

""The office began implementing its emergency procedures as soon as it became apparent that the number of no-shows was a problem. The elections staff and other personnel are filling in as emergency recruits.""

>DeBeauvoir said the fear of the coronavirus wasn't the only reason given as a reason for not coming in but it was the one that concerned her.

>""It worries me that the coronavirus issue was a disruption for this election, especially since I know it's not here at all.

""Wash your hands after you vote. We do basic cleaning in the polling place, as we always do. We have Purell and wipes for the screens, all of that.

The only death rate I could find for the flu puts it at 0.13% death rate, but influenza has a vaccine so I don't know if it is a fair comparison.

A better comparison might be the Spanish Flu which is estimated to have killed between 2-3% those infected.

I personally think this year's Corona outbreak will settle around 3-3.5% case-mortality rate mainly because of China being caught off guard. I'm no expert though and have no evidence to back up my prediction.

However, to your second point, a mask CAN be useful when you are directly caring for an infected person, but you should still be well trained and versed in how to properly use a mask.

>* CDC does not recommend the routine use of respirators outside of workplace settings (in the community). Most often, spread of respiratory viruses from person-to-person happens among close contacts (within 6 feet). CDC recommends everyday preventive actions to prevent the spread of respiratory viruses, such as avoiding people who are sick, avoiding touching your eyes or nose, and covering your cough or sneeze with a tissue. People who are sick should stay home and not go into crowded public places or visit people in hospitals. Workers who are sick should follow CDC guidelines and stay home when they are sick.

As you mention, masks are helpful if you're already sick to prevent transmission to other people. If you are feeling sick or have reason to believe you may have COVID-19, you should talk to a doctor/Cornell Health directly, who would then recommend whether or not you wear a mask."

>Local hospital isolation rooms are full of COVID-19 patients who haven’t yet been reported. 

>We are quickly approaching the current capacity of the hospitals to treat people. 

>There are far more cases than are being acknowledged; based on patterns of spread seen in China & reported in the WHO report (who.int/docs/default-s…) we are probably looking at 1k-2k cases & between 50 and 150 people hospitalized on oxygen &/or ventilators because of the disease.

>The people who aren’t hospitalized are currently spreading the virus largely unchecked, and right now have no way to get tested. This is an exponential growth problem. Roughly every 6 days, we get another generation of infections that’s more than 2x times the size of the last generation. So 1k->2k->4k->8k->16k->32k->64k->128k->256k by sometime in April. 20% of those people need hospitalization. 

>20% of 256k is about 50k people hospitalized. From this one cluster spreading. And it’s clear there is more than one cluster spreading in the US right now. We don’t have that many hospital beds or respirators. 

>In China, they slowed the spread by doing massive testing, closing schools and workplaces, and contact tracing every case including the mild ones. That path is really hard for the US to follow. 

>There are some policy things that could be done to limit the damage. 

>Policy item #1: make Coronavirus testing & treatment free for everyone (probably via Medicaid). You want to catch & isolate everyone case. 

>Policy item #2: Get massive numbers of effective test kits into the hands of docs & clinics ASAP. Fly them in from Germany or China. Every day of delay in testing people, the virus spreads to more people. Time is of the essence. 

>Policy item #3: Figure out a way to keep money in the pockets of anybody who stays home sick because of this. People need to pay rent and buy food, and this is a societal crisis. 

>Policy item #4: Move quickly to keep businesses affected by this afloat. Businesses will be crippled by supply chain problems, people out sick, customers in isolation. Make SBA disaster relief loans widely available for any business who needs them. 

>Cancel large gatherings and school sooner rather than later in areas of outbreak. Yes, it’s super inconvenient, but will also be inconvenient when kids have parents die of this because the child brought the infection home & there were no more hospital beds for the parent.

>They chose not to prepare our supply stockpiles, our health workers, or the general public. I think they screwed the health workers over the most. The people fighting on the front lines. They knew doctors were dying in China, they knew they needed protection from the viral loads, and still they didn't give them the information and resources they needed to protect themselves early on, and didn't proactively start producing more resources that they knew we would need

It is true that they ought to have created stockpiles of PPE especially in preparation for *any* pandemic. The US has one, I haven't been able to find a single EU country with one (but haven't looked very hard). But even the US only has like 30million masks on hand. That is *pathetic*, considering that during normal periods governments can buy masks for practically nothing. They should have stockpiled many, many more than that in preparation for an event like this. 

Better yet: they shouldn't have offshored all the damn production to China. People were warning them that if a crisis like this came up, it [would not be possible to meet demand for PPE in the US](http://archive.li/AjmfW). Europe doesn't even seem to have thought about it at all. 

So by the time this situation started looking grim in January it was already way too late.

Percentages are fractions of a number. Alone, they mean nothing. You can’t compare .1% to .5% to 100% without clarifying what the percentage is of.

For example: 5% seems 5x bigger than 1% however: 5% of 100 is 5, but 1% of 1000 is 10.

applied to the problem at hand: something like .1% of all flu infections die while something between .5-3% of all coronavirus infections die.

THE KEY: **coronavirus is more transmissible and THERE IS NO VACCINE FOR IT LIKE THERE IS FOR THE FLU.** we have no specific immunity as the virus is novel; we've never been exposed to it before. this makes the vulnerable population MUCH LARGER FOR CORONAVIRUS THAN FOR THE FLU. 
this means that the .5-2.5% coefficient could eventually be applied to a much larger number IF the spread continues. **the spread has only begun.** that means the number the coefficient can be applied to is still relatively small. to that point, I have yet to see ANY evidence pointing toward the possibility of containment. quite the contrary. if you've got any good argument for how this virus will be contained, short of the same rigorous quarantines in Hubei (which is still growing in infections and deaths), i'm all ears.

### Person-to-person spread

The virus is thought to spread mainly from person-to-person.

* Between people who are in close contact with one another (within about 6 feet).
* Through respiratory droplets produced when an infected person coughs or sneezes.

These droplets can land in the mouths or noses of people who are nearby or possibly be inhaled into the lungs.

### Spread from contact with infected surfaces or objects

It may be possible that a person can get COVID-19 by touching a surface or object that has the virus on it and then touching their own mouth, nose, or possibly their eyes, but this is not thought to be the main way the virus spreads."

I live alone. Only child. Only relatives left are aging or already frail and not nearby.

I am isolated (socially) by choice. Long ago divorced, no kids, and my last relationship ended disastrously.

I am afraid because it's ""just me"". Well, me and my dog. No one to take care of me or us should things go south. No one to bail me out if I run up hospital bills. No one to take care of my dog should I be hospitalized. 

I am doing everything I can at work to keep myself safe, and everyone is mocking me. They all are well to do with big families and no worries, which is making daily life that much more frustrating and maddening.

I am scared and alone, and everyone around me thinks coronavirus is a hilarious joke.

Sorry for the rant...I should have been in bed hours ago, but instead I'm perusing Reddit and sounding pathetic.

Edit: Also, despite my extreme caution, I ended up with a short bout of flu recently. That terrifies me. I feel like my ""fire drill"" has failed. Short of quitting my job (and then losing my home) I can't possibly be more ""perfect"" in my hygeine/prevention procedures."

When Klopp joined Liverpool I saw an interview where he was asked “what is your favourite thing about football” and he said something like “you don’t need the best players to be the best team”

I like that, he’s right and he’s proved it. They have some pretty average players in that side considering their success, particularly in midfield. But as a unit they are formidable at their peak. 

Anyway, fuck em. Hope Athletico nail them and coronavirus fears mean they don’t win a title, or at least have to win it behind closed doors and have no victory parade."

Small consolation to the victims (you guys and patients), but its something. If such a charge would be possible, maybe informing the police would be a good idea? If warrants are issued in time and they can narrow down suspects, maybe they can find the thief and get some of the masks back in time?

The flu doesn't seem to be bad enough to scare people (yet we've had like 20k deaths in the US this season, and like every season). Nor does the ever encroaching antibiotic resistance.

There are a lot of sanitary practices that are simply ignored in some countries. Perhaps the niche will always be filled by some pathogen, but, we don't know that until we've exhausted every possible option.

A few sources so that you can educate yourself on some of the issues surrounding disease and how its spread

> In 2005, two teams independently reported the discovery of novel coronaviruses related to human SARS-CoV, which were named SARS-CoV-related viruses or SARS-like coronaviruses, in horseshoe bats (genus Rhinolophus)15,43. These discoveries suggested that bats may be the natural hosts for SARS-CoV and that civets were only intermediate hosts. Subsequently, many coronaviruses phylogenetically related to SARS-CoV (SARSr-CoVs) were discovered in bats from different provinces in China and also from European, African and Southeast Asian countries

“Democrats are insisting the spending package include significant funding to purchase large amounts of coronavirus diagnostics, treatments and vaccine, when it becomes available, which would then be made available to the public free of cost, according to a senior Democratic aide,” reported Politico. However, “Republicans are trying to eliminate the ‘fair and reasonable price’ federal procurement standard for the vaccines and treatments that will be developed and purchased with the emergency funds. ‘Fair and reasonable price’ is a basic standard to prevent price gouging in federal contracts. Without the language, drugmakers could charge the government above-market rates, meaning fewer Americans will have access, according to the Democratic aide.”"

A second-year high school student (aged 17) at a private high school in the metropolitan area said ""We were told by the school not to go out for unnecessary or non-emergency reasons, but there's nothing to do even if I stay at home and I was getting annoyed. I took disinfectant alcohol from my parents and came here with my friends.""

You hit the mark. Warren is a once in a lifetime opportunity to bring big structural progressive change and competence to government.

Look at the coronavirus threat: she's the only candidate (and only elected official) that has released a sound strategy to control it and counter the economic harm that an outbreak would cause. How does she go at it? By having a deep, compassionate, and expert understanding of both human and market behavior. She understands that folks will be afraid to get diagnosed and be hit with big medical bills, afraid to be quarantined and miss their work paycheck. So her plan would make all coronavirus testing, vaccination, treatment free. Anyone with the virus would receive payments to help cushion against lost pay.  On top of that, she'd inject a large stimulus package into economy to keep it buoyed up. She's smart, sensible, and works so freakin hard on the details that are the difference between a plan flopping and succeeding. This is how she'd approach all our country's challenges and craft solutions to take this nation to an exponentially better place.

Vote your heart. This primary defies expectations. Statistical predictions change overnight. In 2016, all the models said the probable winner was Hillary Clinton. Polls, analytical models don't choose our President. We do. Besides, this is how many delegates each of the candidates still need to win the nomination.

Bernie needs 1,931 additional delegates

Biden needs 1,937 .

Warren needs 1,983.

It's just the start of this fight. Nothing is guaranteed for any of them. I'm so jealous you get to vote in a Super Tuesday state. You have a chance to set the pace for the rest of us voting later."

Which we all know he will try. 

The point is, commerce will continue for another two weeks. You don't matter. Most of you are just stats. 

The USA should have admitted of making a mistake of not testing people for the CoronaVirus because they fucked up a test that they opted to make multi-purpose and thus more complex than it needed to be.  Then, they should have contacted other countries and gotten tests from them. What is the point of having soft-power if you don't use it when it matters, and it is resonable? Anything but to be flying blind at this crucial juncture. Mitigation? Yeah, right.

2020-03-03,_thunder_god_,Coronavirus,8,https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/fcr8dy/daily_discussion_post_march_3_2020_questions/fjduy8c/,"Some back of the envelope math -- to enlighten our idiot cheetoface's ideas. 

  
 The fatality rate for COVID-19 has fluctuated as the disease has spread. In late January, the worldwide fatality rate was 2%, but [as of Feb. 27](https://cdn.factcheck.org/UploadedFiles/Screenshot-10.png), the figure would be **3.4%,** with 82,550 cases confirmed and 2,810 deaths.   


***IF--*** the CoVid19 is as contagious as the common flu -- In 2018-2019, 35.5 million people had flu symptoms in the U.S., according to [preliminary estimates from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention](https://www.cdc.gov/flu/about/burden/index.html).  

Since 2010, influenza in the U.S. has caused between 9 million and 45 million illnesses annually, the CDC says, with 12,000 to 61,000 of those resulting in death. That would put ***influenza’s fatality rate at 0.13% to 0.14%*** 

Given that same ""infection rate"" -- 35.5 Million people at 3.5% CoVid's Fatality rate equals -   **1,242,500** **dead.....*****each year.*** 

\---

BUT the CoronaVirus is **MUCH** more contagious than influenza. Currently - CoVid19 at a R0 of 1.8-3.5 (so lets call it 2.5 until more data is present), where the regular seasonal flu is around 1.3   


*Each infected person is more than doubling the exposure of the virus to the population.*  


So we may be looking at a population of **88 Million infected annually at 3.5% deathrate,**   
**3.1 Million deaths per year --  each ""covid season""**  


someone double check my numbers please....but an estimate of 3.1 Millions deaths. thats fucking insane. No wonder nationwide quarantines are underway."

The main reason? They object to a provision that prevents drug manufacturers from overcharging the government for any vaccines or other treatment.   
   
“Democrats are insisting the spending package include significant funding to purchase large amounts of coronavirus diagnostics, treatments and vaccine, when it becomes available, which would then be made available to the public free of cost, according to a senior Democratic aide,” reported Politico. However, “Republicans are trying to eliminate the ‘fair and reasonable price’ federal procurement standard for the vaccines and treatments that will be developed and purchased with the emergency funds. ‘Fair and reasonable price’ is a basic standard to prevent price gouging in federal contracts. Without the language, drugmakers could charge the government above-market rates, meaning fewer Americans will have access, according to the Democratic aide.”"

Coronavirus is a respiratory disease exemplifying similar symptoms as the flu in severe cases. Most people infected 80-90+% will run a fever. Mild cases will show no symptoms and extreme cases will have respiratory failure.

Influenza, being that over millions of people have been infected, have a death rate of over 18,000 this season, which constitutes 0.1%

The mortality rate of the flu is about 0.1% and while it does fluctuate every season that's a 1/1000 chance approximately.

Coronavirus is far less widespread, obviously. However, the reason why people are far more concerned is that the fatality rate for coronavirus is recorded around 1-2%. That's between a 1/100 and 1/50 chance. Obviously there are things that affect it such as our immune systems, and there seems to be a much lesser chance that anyone at NC State will be infected, but the scare is in that FAR greater fatality rate.

I then called customer service to see if they could waive the $300 (per ticket) cancellation fee. The customer service rep said that he couldn't do anything about it, and advised us to contact AA's Customer Relations (via an online form). Even talking to a supervisor (who was way less helpful than the rep) didn't get us anything.

I filled out the online form last night (8:30pm). I kept the explanation pretty brief (we were cancelling our trip due to the coronavirus situation; was it possible for the $300 cancellation fee to be waived). By 3pm today I had been contacted by someone on the Customer Relations team who immediately offered a full refund, either to the original form of payment, or as a voucher. By 8pm today we had confirmation on the AA website that the full ticket amounts were being refunded to our credit card.

We were offered change fee waivers for changing our flights by the Customer Relations rep too, but we would have needed to travel by one year after our initial ticket purchase date (May '19), and fare differences would apply.

Obviously YMMV, but I figured it was worth a share. Also please be nice to your customer service reps! This situation probably isn't fun for them as well."

It appears that there's a large push here and in the American rhetoric in general, to be against masks. While there is some truth, **we need to acknowledge that this rhetoric is not the complete picture**.

**There's information that refutes that masks are ineffective:**

* We do know that [masks ARE effective against droplet-based infections,](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4294054/) such as Mers-CoV. So this directly refutes the claim that masks are ineffective.
* There are [further studies that do show masks ARE effective](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2818714/) against other flu-like-illnesses, such as the H1N1.

**There's also incomplete information**

* We still [don't know if this virus is airborne](https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/conditions-and-diseases/coronavirus/coronavirus-disease-2019-vs-the-flu), especially during the asymptomatic phase
   * If this virus is airborne, then this goes beyond sneezing and coughing. It can be transmissible just by breathing (and by long distances). If this is the case, which we should assume that it is, everyone should be wearing masks because you may be asymptomatic.

**There's also conflicting actions by nations**

* The US and the EU are actively issuing information for people to stop wearing masks.
* However, there are other countries like South Korea and Japan that encourage people to wear masks. I don't think South Korea and Japan have access to any more or less information to those researchers in the West. They're also not anymore smarter or dumb.

Australia is a completely different economy though which is why it makes no sense for it to happen here, we manufacturer our own toilet paper while they get theirs imported.

Comparing it to the flu - I have never met anyone who knows anyone who has died of the flu (knock on wood), so the flu has never felt threatening, at least here in the USA. I’m 35 and I’ve never in my life known anyone to die of the flu (again, knock on wood). So will coronavirus be like that?

Are We Panicking Too Much About Coronavirus?

The short answer: Yes.
by Chris Queen

Coronavirus. COVID-19. Wuhan Flu. Whatever you choose to call it, it’s dominating the headlines. We haven’t really seen anything like this in our lifetimes: a disease that has spread so quickly and caused so much panic.
Is the panic a bit too much? The short answer is: Yes.
Witness what’s going on here in Atlanta, where the Atlanta Journal-Constitution is reporting a run on staples and cleaning products at metro area stores:
Even before Georgia’s first two coronavirus cases were confirmed Monday night, shoppers — some sheepish and some emphatic — packed at least some local stores in recent days for items to deal with a possible pandemic. Hot sellers included cases of water, hand sanitizer, disinfecting alcohol and cleaning wipes, facial tissues and paper towels, leaving some store shelves temporarily depleted, though more supplies are on the way, said workers at two local Costcos and a local Walmart. 
It’s one thing to be prepared for a crisis, and it’s a whole different matter to go into prepper mode. Atlanta shoppers have noticed this fact:
Tia Savay of Lawrenceville was shopping Costco on Monday, but she said she wasn’t picking up anything extra because she already had enough cleaning supplies and water with what she regularly gets.
“I know it’s a scary deal, but I think people are taking it out of proportion,” she said.
A friend of mine posted on Facebook that the media is partially to blame before the panic, because they’re not putting coronavirus into perspective as compared to the flu. I’ve edited her statement for language…
If the media would report every time someone in the US/world-in-general died from the flu and/or pneumonia, everyone would be saying coronoawho? 
These news outlets….we’re more likely to die from being suffocated by their [nonsense] than anything else. Bless them.
Look, Coronavirus is a scary thing, and we need to be vigilant. Wash hands, cover your coughs and sneezes, have a little extra cleaning stuff around, and avoid shaking hands.
But do we need to panic? Absolutely not. Let’s keep our heads.

The 2020 COVID-19 disease outbreak caused by the SARS-CoV-2 (aka coronavirus) has currently caused 30 cases here in Canada with no known fatalities.

It had a global number of infections of 8,096 and 774 deaths, representing a 9.6% fatality rate. By current data, the 2020 SARS-CoV-2 is significantly less deadly, but it is likely more infectious. That being said it is too early too tell, but the current hysteria is *WAY* out of proportion for the current state of the outbreak. Be alert, not anxious. Take standard precautions of washing your hands regularly, stay out of crowds, and for the love of God, stay home if you're sick.

8.1% of of the world’s 90K confirmed cases, though - 7,290 - are you, your age.   

A bunch are going to end up in the hospital.  Not really clear how many.  729 at 10%, 1458 at 20%....of the world’s 20-39 cases did.

0.2% of them died.  So 15 died.   

It’s not the zombie apocalypse.  If you’re young. But it’s not nothing.   

Of the students that get sick “many” are going to end up in the hospital fighting for air and a “few” are going to die.   

I’m not a math person so sue me if I got my numbers wrong, but it’s not a joke.  

Now let’s remember that there are plenty of older people on campuses all day long, too.

And, after all that, what is there to do about it?"

China, Iran, South Korea, Japan, Italy etc...all battling a virulent Novel Coronavirus epidemic, are losing ground every hour and now the US is on the verge of going exponential - this we know.

The only way to lessen the impact is to restrict movement, practice social distancing, good hygiene and finding a place to stay put for a while - allowing the virus to burn out.

We need to flatten the curve - this is critical.

At what point do we start?

All the best to you and yours."

I know I'll get downvoted for this but let me explain.   
The obvious one is Seniors. I am a Junior, but I still understand that pushing back classes and possibly canceling them will have a rippling effect on Seniors. Graduations can be pushed back, and this affects people who had the intention of having full-time jobs, preparations for grad/med school, things like that. Not to mention that this will affect all years, but will have the most immediate affect on Seniors.   


If NYU cancels classes, it will be extremely hard to make up the time lost. I am from the NYU Florence campus and the online courses we are receiving are screwing us over hard. Some material can't be taught online and needs to be taught in person. Furthermore, professors absolutely hate this, with technical difficulties, and lack of coordination I am set back 2 weeks and midterms are still coming regardless of whether we complete them online or not. Material is poorly taught and will mess you up harder in the long run for the second set of midterms and finals. Example:  Cancelled classes does not mean that professors will stop assigning you readings that you are responsible for over the course of time. Meaning, if you don't understand something you have limited access and opportunity to clarify it before midterms.   


Pushing NYU to do this could possibly have students exit housing. We sometimes forget that while NYU has its headquarters in NYC it can still push students out of housing and tell them to go to a safer location if home is a safer locations. This is happening abroad. Example, if the coronavirus had hit NYC first and cases escalated, they would have sent students home earlier, and pushed the semester back one month. This is money that will not be refunded to students. This is happening in Florence right now. Students were sent forced to be sent back, it didn't matter where they went , they just couldn't be on campus.  Parents are pissed right now because money was spent to send students to NYU sites and NYU is staying firm that it will not refund any sort of housing payments to students. 

I don't mean to sound hard, I just want everyone to know what the courses of actions will lead to. Feel free to disagree or comment below, I don't mind chatting further about this :) I promise I don't mean to be rude, I probably am missing a bigger picture too and public concern is well enough of a reason to take action.  In the meantime, we just have been regular people who practice good hygiene and this will blow-over fast."

He was researching it but thinks there's no clear idea of where it came from? Oh good lord, it originated in Wuhan, China. It either mutated and transferred to humans in what are called ""wet markets"" where live animals are sold as food or it originated in a biolab in the Wuhan area. The first possibility is the much most likely as this is how flus and coronaviruses transmit to humans. The second is mostly entertained by wackadoodles - folks, its just not virulent enough to be a weaponized virus. Now there a Patient Zero named Wu Chen who was the first person sick? No. That doesn't mean we don't know where this came from.

Swine flu killed about 18,000 people so Jeremy questioning that is just Jeremy being ignorant. If they've spent time researching this, you'd think this and how plain old influenza routinely kills about 25000 to 30000 each year would be something they're aware of.

I wonder as Jeremy was noting that thousands of deaths are a bummer but he's not in the category likely to be hit so it's just a bummer for him if he gave any consideration to his three remaining grandparents who do fall into the bummer group that could die easily of this? Heck even Matt and Amy and his inlaws aren't exactly young. What a completely callous and insensitive remark for him to make.

The housing fall and subsequent severe recession was like coronavirus in that the second is likely to trigger a severe recession. They're otherwise much different events. The housing crisis was the result of years of bad decisions with various moneylenders getting greedy. It was barely ""contained"" - folks you don't want to know how close we came to going belly up financially. It could have been a lot worse. The coronavirus is a natural event that at this point really can't be contained but hopefully isn't going to be worse than a harsh flu where 30,000 people die.  These are not similar events.

Bode's hair is ginger? Weren't they going on about Ember having red in her hair at this age? I hope for his sake that he is because they're going to be disappointed if he's not."

MHLW official ones), ca. 450, in the last 10 days : https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/fct2jy/nhk_reports_that_10_prefectures_in_japan/

According to him, there is a chart on what the response will be in regards to how close the virus is to us. For instance, the school will respond differently to a confirmed virus in Charleston than they would to one in Greenville. Apparently the school is mostly concerned about cases in the four counties closest to us. He also said that if there is a confirmed case on campus, we will switch to e-learning and students will be asked to stay home. Each department is being asked to come up with a plan for how to respond if this were to occur. According to my professor, Clemson does not want to do anything that will delay graduation or future plans. The school is taking this very seriously. The students returning from abroad are going to be quarantined for two weeks. However, my professor was vague about what might happen after spring break, but the rumor that we will move to online courses is not unsubstantiated. Apparently there were all kinds of proposed solutions, such as canceling spring break, but my professor said that was ridiculous and highly unlikely.

But, the article in my headline alludes that respiratory medicine decreases immunity which in turn potentially allows the virus to stay in the body longer.  I hope this can clear up the misunderstanding between risk of infection and aftermath risk for those with pre-existing respiratory issues.

tl;dr  :  if you got breathing issues already, be extra cautious even if you have ""no increased risk of infection"" than the average Joe. The medicine you take for breathing issues can weaken your immune system.

*“I tried to explain that I was just tired and hungover, but they moved everyone on my row away and made me lie down,” the woman explained of plane staffers.*


*“They also asked me to put a mask on and started taking my temperature [every 30 minutes], but the readings were really up and down.*

As the coronavirus continues to spread, multinational record companies are putting the brakes on international travel.

In an internal memo to employees, Universal Music Group noted, “for the health and well-being of our staff, and in order to be a responsible member of the global community seeking to stop the spread of the coronavirus (COVID-19), we have put in place new policies and procedures, including: Suspended international business travel until further notice; postponed internal employee conferences requiring travel; and continued to comply with the guidance of local governments, the World Health Organization and the Centers for Disease Control.”

Sony Music Group is prohibiting travel to Asia and Northern Italy -- the areas where the largest amount of cases have been reported -- according to a source. Otherwise, it is up to the employee's discretion whether to take a trip.


Similarly, Warner Music Group has stopped work travel to heavily affected areas, including Asia, Italy and Iran, says a source. Warner Music Group's publishing division, Warner Chappell, also postponed a conference slated for the end of March and WMG postponed marketing meetings scheduled for Madrid.

BMG has issued guidelines urging its employees to avoid international as well as intra-continental travel, noting that all new travel proposals will be approved only if they are critical for business. Meanwhile, the company has banned travel to mainland China outright, restricted travel to Germany and ordered employees in Hong Kong and Beijing to work remotely.

Kobalt has suspended all employee travel internationally, restricted non-essential domestic travel and instituted a requirement for employees to conduct all job interviews via video conference. Next week, the company will be conducting a two-day remote-working trial for all staff to prepare for a potential worsening of the crisis.

Concord has suspended all international trips until further notice and “all non-essential domestic travel is strongly discouraged,” according to a human resources memo sent to staffers. “When possible, you should conduct necessary business meetings across locations via teleconference or Skype for Business.”"

edit 17:33:34 GMT-0500 (Eastern Standard Time): Seeing the CNBC article regarding the WHO statement. Sounds weird to debate with a news source but I actually think the journalist misinterpreted Ghebreyesus' statement. Ghebreyesus stated that 3.4% of cases reported have died, which is a simple figure arrived by calculating deaths/cases. 

Proof: Current cases = 92,817. Current deaths = 3,159. 3,159/92,817 = 3.403%

The earlier 2% figure, to my knowledge, was a very complicated calculation that wasn't simply the current deaths/current case rate. From what I've read, many experts project that the rate will be lower than 2% as many milder cases have gone undiagnosed. It frustrates me to see journalism like this that isn't medical at all and is merely a health journalist speculating. Not what this country needs right now and the panic this causes is not helping the lack of supply that medical professionals are experiencing. Stay calm folks, wash your hands, and wait on good scientific information.

I've read the symptoms of coronavirus are very similar to a mild cold/flu, which I wouldn't  seek medical attention for since I'm still relatively young so any cold/flu I get, if any, is likely to be over with in a day or so. However, I know health officials are trying to keep track of coronavirus cases to determine where they came from and help prevent further spread. At the same time, I know that if many people become seriously ill, our medical infrastructure will be under extreme stress and will only be able to help the worst cases.

So, the question: If I start getting mild cold/flu symptoms, is it better for me to stay home and treat myself unless I feel I need emergency medical attention? Or is it more important to see a doctor right away so that if it is coronavirus, they can do whatever they need to do.. I guess damage control? I'm not too worried about myself, I'm in an age range with a high survival rate, but rather my impact on other people. Staying home seems better in terms of not getting other people sick, but without a diagnosis I wouldn't know if it was coronavirus or not and whether or not I'd be still contagious after I felt better and went back to work."

- Avoid close contact with people who are sick.
- Avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth with
unwashed hands.
- Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. Use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol if soap and water are not available.
- Stay home when you are sick.
- Cover your cough or sneeze with a tissue, then throw the tissue in the trash.
- Clean and disinfect frequently touched objects
and surfaces if you are sick.

The [World Health Organization advice](https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/advice-for-public) is basically the same. Some slight differences:

- stay at least 3 feet (1 metre) away from anyone who is coughing or sneezing.

- cover your mouth and nose with your bent elbow or tissue when you cough or sneeze. Then dispose of the used tissue immediately.

Edit: I don’t care if people use essential oils—they probably don’t do any harm. 

But Vicky Vox’s  post could unintentionally leave people with the impression that things that do help prevent the spread of coronavirus are ineffective.

She said “antibacterial will not fight the coronavirus.”

It’s true that putting antibacterial additives in soap doesn’t make the soap any more likely to fight coronavirus.

But washing your hands with soap and water (or using alcohol-based hand sanitizer) is an important part of fighting the spread of coronavirus."

I did a Masters in the UK, then went onto taking a PGCE (teacher-training) course in the UK. Unfortunately, the workload was so severe that I was unable to keep up and recently had to withdraw from said course.

I've now heard back from the immigration people at my university that:

* because I've withdrawn from the course, I have two months to leave the country;
* because I didn't complete the course, even though I have a Masters, since it wasn't obtained during my current visa, I'm unable to switch to a Tier 2 visa while in the UK;
* I can only apply for a Tier 5 visa from outside the UK; and
* there is no other way for me to stay in the UK legally.

I only had my first GIC appointment two weeks ago. If I have to move back to Hong Kong, where the protests and coronavirus are raging due to incompetent government, where there are very few LGBT rights (only recently were same-sex marriages from overseas recognized, and there's likely no easily-accessible resources for transition), and where my parents don't support me being trans and think it's a choice (not to mention that they also downplay my autism and ADHD, and I recently heard that my mother's been racist when I'm not around), there's every possibility that I'm not going to be able to attend the second GIC appointment.

My mental health is going to seriously suffer. I don't know if I'll be able to stay sane enough to not harm myself in some way; due to the aforementioned autism and ADHD, I don't have many friends in Hong Kong, and certainly none I can move in with.

Unfortunately, it's not going to be possible for me to obtain asylum in this country, since I have no evidence that I'll be government-persecuted, or seriously harmed or discriminated against while in Hong Kong."

2020-03-03,kokopuffd,Coronavirus,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/fd1mwe/coronavirus_diaries_i_spend_hours_removing/fjewjjw/,"Dear Family and Friends, as some of you may recall, when I was a professor of pathology at the University of California San Diego, I was one of the first molecular virologists in the world to work on coronaviruses (the 1970s). I was the first to demonstrate the number of genes the virus contained. Since then, I have kept up with the coronavirus field and its multiple clinical transfers into the human population (e.g., SARS, MERS), from different animal sources.

The current projections for its expansion in the US are only probable, due to continued insufficient worldwide data, but it is most likely to be widespread by mid to late March and April.

Here is what I have done and the precautions that I take and will take. These are the same precautions I currently use during our influenza seasons, except for the mask and gloves.:

1) NO HANDSHAKING! Use a fist bump, slight bow, elbow bump, etc.

2) Use ONLY your knuckle to touch light switches. elevator buttons, etc.. Lift the gasoline dispenser with a paper towel or use a disposable glove.
6333302
3) Open doors with your closed fist or hip - do not grasp the handle with your hand, unless there is no other way to open the door. Especially important on bathroom and post office/commercial doors.

4) Use disinfectant wipes at the stores when they are available, including wiping the handle and child seat in grocery carts.

5) Wash your hands with soap for 10-20 seconds and/or use a greater than 60% alcohol-based hand sanitizer whenever you return home from ANY activity that involves locations where other people have been.

6) Keep a bottle of sanitizer available at each of your home's entrances. AND in your car for use after getting gas or touching other contaminated objects when you can't immediately wash your hands.

7) If possible, cough or sneeze into a disposable tissue and discard. Use your elbow only if you have to. The clothing on your elbow will contain infectious virus that can be passed on for up to a week or more!

What I have stocked in preparation for the pandemic spread to the US:

1) Latex or nitrile latex disposable gloves for use when going shopping, using the gasoline pump, and all other outside activity when you come in contact with contaminated areas.

Note: This virus is spread in large droplets by coughing and sneezing. This means that the air will not infect you! BUT all the surfaces where these droplets land are infectious for about a week on average - everything that is associated with infected people will be contaminated and potentially infectious. The virus is on surfaces and you will not be infected unless your unprotected face is directly coughed or sneezed upon. This virus only has cell receptors for lung cells (it only infects your lungs). The only way for the virus to infect you is through your nose or mouth via your hands or an infected cough or sneeze onto or into your nose or mouth.

2) Stock up now with disposable surgical masks and use them to prevent you from touching your nose and/or mouth (We touch our nose/mouth 90X/day without knowing it!). This is the only way this virus can infect you - it is lung-specific. The mask will not prevent the virus in a direct sneeze from getting into your nose or mouth - it is only to keep you from touching your nose or mouth.

3) Stock up now with hand sanitizers and latex/nitrile gloves (get the appropriate sizes for your family). The hand sanitizers must be alcohol-based and greater than 60% alcohol to be effective.

4) Stock up now with zinc lozenges. These lozenges have been proven to be effective in blocking coronavirus (and most other viruses) from multiplying in your throat and nasopharynx. Use as directed several times each day when you begin to feel ANY ""cold-like"" symptoms beginning. It is best to lie down and let the lozenge dissolve in the back of your throat and nasopharynx. Cold-Eeze lozenges is one brand available, but there are other brands available.

I, as many others do, hope that this pandemic will be reasonably contained, BUT I personally do not think it will be. Humans have never seen this snake-associated virus before and have no internal defense against it. Tremendous worldwide efforts are being made to understand the molecular and clinical virology of this virus. Unbelievable molecular knowledge about the genomics, structure, and virulence of this virus has already been achieved. BUT, there will be NO drugs or vaccines available this year to protect us or limit the infection within us. Only symptomatic support is available.

I hope these personal thoughts will be helpful during this potentially catastrophic pandemic. Good luck to all of us

You most certainly can compare rates/ratios, its one of their main benefits. Especially where there can be large differences in their possible sample sizes. That's literally the point of them. 

And if you follow what you are trying to say, the flu would be more dangerous by the sheer fact how many more people it does infect. Which is the opposite of the overly dramatic point you were trying to make.

> THE KEY: coronavirus is more transmissible and THERE IS NO VACCINE FOR IT LIKE THERE IS FOR THE FLU.

This is only half true. There is no vaccine. As for the first part, the WHO disagrees 

> First, COVID-19 does not transmit as efficiently as influenza, from the data we have so far.
> With influenza, people who are infected but not yet sick are major drivers of transmission, which does not appear to be the case for COVID-19.

But Turkey successfully managed to prevent any cases. I need to share this step by step guide for any policymaker in the world that happens to be reading r/Wuhan_Flu.

1 - Don't test anyone. This is the key but it's not that easy. If you don't test anyone people won't trust you. So you should hide the fact that you are not testing. So the rest of the guide is about how to not test.

2 - Never let hospitals test alone. Have a centralized testing facility so every hospital sends samples there so they have to rely on your tests.

3 - Don't make news about the virus. Turkish media is controlled by Erdogan. Turkey has the highest amount of journalists in prison in the world (more than twice as much as China.) So no journalist will be spreading ""fake news"". When people don't hear about the virus they won't be alarmed.

4 - Develop your test kit. Turkey developed its own test kit. They claim it gives results in 15 minutes and the highest accuracy in the world. So the world's best test kit super-fast results and super accurate. But it never gave any positive results yet. So when doctors see test kit says ""negative"" they have no way to prove it's positive.

5 - Have an ongoing economical crisis. Turkey has an ongoing economic crisis and relies on tourism revenue. If tourists are going to stop visiting Turkey, this year the economy will totally collapse. Since Erdogan is now at war in Syria economical collapse will be the end of his rule.

6 - Have a semi-authoritarian regime. None of the above-mentioned steps could be completed if everyone has freedom of speech. So there should be a leader which can send people to prison anytime he pleases. So no one will be brave enough to spread fake news.

7 - Control social media. Turkey has the highest amount of requests from Twitter to learn users' IP addresses and punish users. They also have the highest number of requests to Reddit to remove content. So if random people spread fake news you can easily send them to prison.

8 - Quarantine people (Optional) If you don't you won't look like that you are managing well. So just quarantine people as a normal country would do. So you can give relief.

If you follow these steps hopefully you'll manage to have no cases at all. Your tourism income will continue to feed your authoritarian regime. Stay clean from coronavirus and stay in the power!

By MoreGull.  

I was on a packed subway car in winter, at the height of sick season. A business dude who is standing up holding the bar sneezes into his hands (polite!), and I can tell it's wet because he tries wiping it on his jacket surreptitiously, but we are watching. He does this for a bit, then puts his hand back on the overhead bar. And then gets off at the next stop. To be replaced by another business man, who puts his hand exactly where the other man put his snot covered hand. This guy then switches hands, and takes the hand that was just touching the bar and does a nice deep eye dig. Getting into the corners. Then a little nose flick. And right there, like a CHOIR OF ANGELS, I saw it all - the virus in business man one escaped via the sneeze, to be deposited on the overhead bar, then picked up by business man two, who promptly put it in his eye and nose.  
And from that point on, I know where my hands have been, and what I am doing with them. So should you.

It is spreading in community in BC (aka non-travel-related). There's little doubt of that. We expect it to be after what we're seeing in Washington, and because we're not testing community cases, we have zero evidence to suggest it hasn't been here for weeks.

We will have evidence it's spreading here as soon as BC finally starts testing more than just people who have travelled to an outbreak area.

We need to start managing this and slowing the spread. Well, we needed to do it six weeks ago, but now is better than tomorrow.

Slowing the inevitable spread means the hospitals are less likely to be overrun by those who the virus hits hard (elders and ill). And it's when there's a shortage of hospital beds (and oxygen bottles, medicine, etc) that the mortality spikes for the elders and ill.

Folding@home (FAH or F@h) is a distributed computing project for disease research that simulates protein folding, computational drug design, and other types of molecular dynamics. The project uses the idle processing resources of hundreds of thousands of personal computers owned by volunteers who have installed the software on their systems. Its main purpose is to determine the mechanisms of protein folding, which is the process by which proteins reach their final three-dimensional structure, and to examine the causes of protein misfolding. This is of interest to medical research into Alzheimer's disease, Huntington's disease, and many forms of cancer, among other diseases.

I volunteer in a hospital and do lots of stocking of masks, other personal protective equipment, hand sanitizer, etc. I know the stockrooms very well and we have a limited amount of supplies. 

Patients who have contact/droplet/infections make our supply dwindle as everything is one-time use and every time you enter the room your equipment has to be changed. We have a limited amount and an increase of patients who need that level of gear will wipe out our stockpiles quicker, not given blatant thievery. It is despicable to me to steal necessary equipment from hospitals. 

Healthcare workers are voluntarily putting themselves at risk when working in close contact with COVID-19 patients. In theory, they don’t have to because of staff safety clauses in contracts. They are much more likely to get sick than your average Joe on the street, as evidenced by previously coronavirus outbreaks such as SARS.

It is incredibly selfish and immoral to steal resources from a hospital. Surprise, the general public doesn’t really need N95’s at all. Just follow the WHO’s advice on COVID-19 precautions and get tested if you think you are sick. If you think you are sick, stay inside and don’t go into public. Call the CDC or local emergency numbers. Don’t steal ultimately ineffective resources from the people who need them the most.

>Some people infected with the virus have no symptoms. When the virus does cause symptoms, common ones include low grade fever, body aches, coughing, nasal congestion, **runny nose**, and sore throat. However, COVID-19 can occasionally cause more severe symptoms like high fever, severe cough and shortness of breath, which often indicates pneumonia.

Right now (stock issues aside) you can order a 'FDA approved' mask from a medical company for $$$$$ (although they might refuse to sell to a non-medical company).  These masks have been tested and evaluated by the FDA itself and thus are very expensive.  

You can order a 'NIOSH approved' mask from Home Depot, Amazon, Grainger, or your local construction supply depot for $20-$400 (depending on type of mask and what its filters protect against).  A high end full face mask with CBRN type cartridges is in the $300 range, a nice half face mask with CBRN type cartridges is in the $60 range, and you don't need CBRN cartridges (a standard P100 filter will do nicely against coronavirus) so that knocks a few more bucks off.  These masks and filters are produced in much greater quantity and are far cheaper than the FDA counterparts, despite probably working just as well.  

Problem is, right now the FDA approved ones are in short supply, to the point that even health workers can't get them in some cases.  So FDA is saying if you can't get the FDA approved ones go buy the NIOSH ones from wherever you can get them from because that's better than nothing.  

Only effect on general public is now health care groups will be shopping at the same places we do, so masks and filters will get harder to find and more expensive."

Edit: [I found one!](https://stage.arthritis.org/about-us/news-and-updates/coronavirus-and-arthritis-what-you-need-to-know)

>Most prescription drugs used to treat inflammatory or autoimmune types of arthritis suppress the immune system, including methotrexate, corticosteroids and biologics, such as infliximab (Remicade), adalimumab (Humira), ixekizumab (Taltz) and ustekinumab (Stelara). Dr. Minna says taking them doesn’t increase your risk of infection beyond that of a healthy person, but you could potentially have more severe disease or complications if you do become infected. The concern is that the virus could replicate too quickly for your body to mount an immune response or your immune response might kick in too slowly, leading to possible heart and lung complications. For this reason, it’s critically important if you are taking these medications to contact your doctor right away if you think you’ve been exposed or are experiencing flu-like symptoms. Be sure to state that you are taking immune-suppressing drugs.

Other useful info in that link for the lazy: Wash yo damn hands, clean things you touch often like phones and light switches, surgical masks won't protect you from contracting the virus, if you do have symptoms call your doctor instead of going to an urgent care, and **don't panic.**"

This is still kinda a big deal. Not so much of a big deal that you should be bathing in hand sanitizer and writing your will, but, like, it shouldn't just be dismissed.

2020-03-03,ChaosKeeshond,Coronavirus,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/fcx34m/rcoronavirus_is_now_the_fastest_growing_subreddit/fjecewd/,"Coronavirus is NOT a non-problem. Most Redditors are under 30.

Most Redditors also have parents, grandparents, aunties, uncles, friends, and parents of friends, teachers, idols, and heroes.

Most Redditors are likely to survive. But most Redditors are also likely to suffer loss.

Coronavirus spreads very easily. If up to 80% of the UK gets infected at some stage, which is a possible scenario that has been presented (n.b. the govt says it is unlikely), and 14% of everyone over 50 who is infected dies (the death rate seems to have been measured a few different ways, the percentage for the over 50's category is consistently very high), then every Redditor is going to experience grief.

Grief is shit. Young people will survive, but someone they care about won't.

It isn't an apocalypse, but it is a metric tonne of avoidable suffering, and the only cost for avoiding it is a bit of vigilance and mindfulness about personal hygiene and contamination.

This ""it's just a cold"" mindset which is permeating the public consciousness is dangerous. Far more dangerous than preexisting bigots temporarily becoming loud bigots."
2020-03-03,Kangarou_Penguin,Coronavirus,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/fcr8dy/daily_discussion_post_march_3_2020_questions/fjef8du/,"The value of confirming cases is likely overrated and definitely misunderstood.

I see everyone on this reddit talking about how WE NEED TO TEST MORE, without actually explaining or thinking about how much it would help. They believe that the solution to this pandemic is to simply confirm cases and quarantine them. But how much effect does confirming cases actually have on the incidence & mortality rate of this virus?

First let's look at the incidence rate. There are 2 important facts here:

1. Every case that is confirmed has been spreading in the population for 5-10 days
2. For every case that is confirmed, there is at least 2 that are spreading in the population for the duration of the individual's mild illness

Confirming cases can only effect case fatality if you have effective treatment measures. There is effectively no difference between treating critical coronavirus infections and treating critical influenza/pnuemonia infections. This includes antibiotics, Oseltamivir, oxygen, mechanical ventilation, ECMO, etc.

&#x200B;

**The only way confirming cases can truly make an impact is by increasing the amount of forced government  quarantine + self-quarantine in the population.**"
