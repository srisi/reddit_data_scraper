""At least one of every two instances of human-to-human transmission of the new coronavirus is believed to occur while the first patient is not yet showing symptoms, according to an estimate by a group of Japanese university researchers.

Based on its determination, the team, headed by Hokkaido University  professor Hiroshi Nishiura, has called for preventive measures as well as reinforcing the medical care system against a potential sharp rise in coronavirus patients, rather than focusing exclusively on isolation as a  way to contain the disease.

According to the estimate based on 26 human-to-human infection cases  released by six countries such as China, Thailand and the United States,  the timing of the secondary infection was shorter than previously  thought.

Although the average period of incubation for the coronavirus  originating from central China is believed to be about five days, the researchers found that second patients in more than half of the 26 human-to-human infection cases under study developed pneumonia symptoms  within five days."""

WUHAN - The government of Hubei province, the central Chinese province that is the epicentre of the coronavirus outbreak, has given the official fatality rates for the virus for the first time, Chinese media reported.

Unexpectedly, Wuhan, the provincial capital city where the virus first emerged, registerd a fatality rate of 4.06 per cent, came in second. It was topped by Tianmen, a nearby city, which has a death rate of 5.08 per cent, Caixin Global reported on Sunday (Feb 9).

With 871 deaths reported as of Sunday, the fatality rate of Hubei province on the whole is 2.88 per cent, the report said.

Since Feb 5, Huanggang has been overtaken as the second most hard-hit city after Wuhan.

As of end of Feb 8, Xiaogan, a city with a population of 4.92 million to the west of Wuhan, reported 2,436 confirmed cases. That compares to the 2,141 cases found among the 7.5 million-strong population of Huanggang, a city to Wuhan's east.

Mr Jiao Yahui, deputy director of the medical administration bureau of the National Health Commission, had earlier explained that the high mortality rate in Hubei can be attributed mainly to the fact that most of the critically ill patients are warded in the province's three main hospitals which are under strain from a lack of beds as well as professional medical staff.

According to medical experts and frontline doctors, 15 to 20 per cent of coronavirus patients could develop severe conditions, and among them 25 to 30 per cent worsen to critical condition, Caixin Global reported.

There has yet to be a widely agreed mortality rate for the disease. Several ICU doctors estimate that the death rate among patients in critical condition ranges from 10 to 40 per cent, meaning the overall mortality rate may be 0.6 to 1 per cent.

Hubei reported 2,618 new confirmed cases and 91 new deaths on Sunday, local health authorities said on Monday, Xinhua reported.

Wuhan reported 1,921 new infections and 73 new deaths, and the cities of Huanggang and Xiaogan reported 115 and 105 new confirmed cases, respectively, according to the Hubei Provincial Health Commission.

The province also saw 356 patients discharged from hospital after recovery on Sunday. It had seen 1,795 patients discharged after recovery from hospital by Sunday.

Hubei had 29,631 confirmed cases of the novel coronavirus infection by Sunday, with 871 deaths and 5,505 cases still in severe or critical conditions.

Across mainland China, there were 3,062 new confirmed infections as of Sunday, bringing the total number so far to 40,171."

**Reported cases of Coronavirus:** 40,614

**Recovered:** 3,324 (8,1%)

I've been following the numbers since the beginning, and there's always around 2% deaths, 8% recovered, and 90% who are still infected. I'm skeptical about the recovered-percentage, because that number should have started with a low % because most people infected simply haven't had time to win against the disease yet, and then after 2-3 weeks it should increase a lot as that seems to be the time it takes to ""beat"" the virus.

I'm not skeptical about the deaths-percentage because we all know that's a lie anyway."

>Japan: The total includes 4 asymptomatic cases, which are not included in the government’s official count.

So what possible reasons could there be for excluding these asymptomatic cases?

Perhaps because there is still debate over whether coronavirus can actually be transmitted asymptomatically or if there are symptoms, but they can be so mild that they often go unnoticed. Or there is a blurred line when considering asymptomatic people between whether or not they are actually ""infected"" since they do not exhibit signs of illness, or if they are just ""carriers"" of the virus."

- While the coronavirus is happening, flu is still happening, and car crashes are still happening. So saying ""it's the same"" wouldn't make sense even if you ignore my next two points. As nCov is not happening ""instead of"" but ""in addition to"" what is already happening with flu and vehicle accidents. It's not something that gradually happened over few years, either. Few weeks we had no clue this is happening, but now it's happening in geometric progression. This is where comes my next point...

- If you take a look at the progression chart, nCov's deaths are not ""1000 a month on average"". They've ramped up from dozens to hundreds a day in a parabolic fashion in less than a month. And those are just the official numbers. This is where comes my next point again...

- We know for a fact the coronavirus deaths are heavily underreported in China, because people dying from complications by it, like bacterial pneumonia are not counted. The hospitals are also overwhelmed, people who die at home or on the streets without diagnosis: not counted. Normal flu doesn't cause instant shortage of medical masks, personnel, and hospital beds. nCov did.

This talking point of ""it's like the flu"" was being made when the Spanish Flu hit initially in 1918 as well. ""No cause for panic, more people die from flu"". That's how newspapers reacted in the first week. Aftermath: 500 million infected (25% of the entire world population) and 50 million dead.

> Edit: woops, the vehicle stat is USA only. 120,000 people die every month from car crashes worldwide. So corona-virus can get 100x worse before its above the noise of all the other ways we can die.

You play very loose with numbers in order to reach a predetermined conclusion, it makes the entire conversation pointless. Now you're comparing worldwide vehicle deaths with the number underreported nCov deaths in a specific Chinese province (as the virus is still ramping up worldwide, we don't know what's next). That doesn't make sense any way I think about it."

It is unclear how many are currently infected. Not only because the numbers from China are inherently unreliable (lets not forget that China deliberately drove sick SARS patients around in ambulances to hide them from the World Health Organization back in 2003), but even if you trust China’s data it is clear they are hitting the limits of their testing capacity.
Officially, just over 40,000 people have been confirmed to be infected with the virus in China. However a study in the Lancet estimated back on January 25th that 75,000 people had already been infected and that the virus was doubling every 6.4 days — which would suggest that more than 300,000 people may now be infected with the virus. But no one knows the true number. Probably not even President Xi.
Even outside of China the numbers are unclear. The head of the WHO tweeted today that we may only be seeing the tip of the iceberg of infected cases:

It is unclear how exactly contagious the virus is.There is still a large range of possible R-nought values for the virus. The R-nought (R0) value, is a measure of how transmissible a disease is, it shows how many people each infected person infects in turn. Most estimates have put the R0 value between R2 and R4 (meaning that each infected person infects 2–4 other people). This is fairly high and does not bode well for hopes of containing the virus. But, it’s also still unclear if China has been able to lower the average transmission rate with their draconian lockdown and quarantine of entire cities.
Perhaps most crucially at this point, it is unclear what the mortality rate of the virus is. Estimates seem to range between 1% and 5%. But it is honestly impossible to determine the mortality rate at this point for a number of reasons.
Firstly, because it’s totally unclear how many people have been infected with only mild symptoms. If a million people have already been infected, the vast majority may never see severe symptoms and the mortality rate may be quite low. However, it’s also unclear if the deaths in China are being fully counted. There are many reports about patients dying before being tested and the deaths not counting on the official totals. We will have to wait to get a clear picture of the mortality rate.
That being said, Hubei province released their official fatality rates yesterday and some cities had rates as high as 4% and 5%. Although this number is fairly meaningless in objective terms for the reasons outlined above, it is telling that these rates are much higher than the official rates in other regions of China and suggests that the mortality rate may rise significantly if the healthcare system becomes overwhelmed as it has in these hardest hit regions of China. This is troubling given the WHO has stated that 15% of patients developed pneumonia and 3–5% required intensive care. Moreover, reportedly the virus does serious damage to people’s lower respiratory systems — supposedly it can take “…at least six months for patients to recover heart and lung function.” If this becomes endemic across the world, even developed nation’s healthcare systems will struggle to provide care.
Mortality Rate Based on Data Outside Mainland China
If we calculate the case fatality rate (CFR) based on the limited data outside of mainland china, we can arrive at our own — very tentative — fatality rate.
Outside of mainland China there have been 461 confirmed cases of coronavirus. Of these cases only 46 have been resolved. 44 cases recovered, and 2 died.
Using these numbers we would arrived at a case fatality rate of:
(2 * 46 )/100 = 4.34%
Obviously, there is too little data for this calculation to be meaningful, but this is the metric that should be watched if you do not trust the numbers coming out of china.
The Economic Impact
Even if the virus can be contained in China, the impact may be devastating for the economy of the country.
One thing that we do know about the outbreak is the unprecedented and draconian measures the Chinese government has taken to slow the spread of the virus. Some 400 million Chinese are now under some form of quarantine across China — in some of the most economically important regions of the country.

Red areas under some form of lockdown. Source: Wuhan Coronavirus Map by Fuuuuuuu · MapHub
Factories are shut down, inflation has already surged to an 8 year high(with food price inflation at 20.6%), and some economists are already predicting that China’s GDP growth will fall to 0% for the next quarter. And the economic damage will increase exponentially if the quarantines are maintained for much longer. To quote an excellent piece from The Telegraph:
…the more thoroughly China enforces this, the greater the global economic shock is likely to be. How can industrial plants really be reopened next week? Yet if it takes another month, it becomes progressively harder to contain the international economic damage, and raises the risk of a Minsky Moment within China’s own hyper-leveraged system keeps rising.
Possible Outcomes
Essentially we don’t know enough hard facts about the virus and China’s success (or failure) in containing the virus to predict the impact on the world.
However, we should be able to make some reasonable predictions within the next 3–4 weeks. By then we should get a better idea of the case fatality rate from cases outside mainland china. We’ll also be able to see if the virus continues to spread around the world over the next month despite china’s draconian quarantine measures.
A wide range of scenarios are plausible at this point of the outbreak. Everything from from slightly worse than the typical flu — to something on par with World War II. You could make a case that the mortality rate is likely to be on par with the seasonal flu — and anyway China is likely to contain the virus. Or, you could make the case that there’s some very troubling initial data coming out of China and the communist government is certainly going to unrepresented lengths (at a great economic cost) to try to contain the outbreak.
Case 1 — The Optimistic Scenario
In the optimistic scenario, a month from now we can calculate, from data outside mainland china, that the CFR is perhaps .3% or below. Moreover, the spread of the virus outside mainland china will stabilize and we will not see additional community spread in other countries. This would be a good indication that China’s containment measures worked at the R0 value has fallen to 1 or bellow.
In this case China will probably make a quick economic recovery, and the virus will be on par with the H1N1 (Swine flu) pandemic of 2009.
Case 2 — Pandemic with Low CFR
In the case two scenario we will be able to calculate that the CFR of the virus is fairly low. Somewhere between .1 % and 1%.
However, the virus is not contained to China and we see sustained community spread in multiple countries outside of China.
This means that the virus would spread — but it would be about as bad as the flu or perhaps 10X as bad as the flu. At the low range of this the economy would make a fairly quick recovery and at the high range it could be a moderate drag on global growth.
Case 3 — Pandemic with Moderate CFR
In this scenario the virus in not contained within China — and the CFR is somewhere around 2%. Anecdotally this appears to be the current base case assumption among the experts.
The closest historical analogy to this would be the 1918 influenza pandemic. This would almost certainly had a fairly large economic impact, hospitals might be overwhelmed, people would be wearing masks on the street. Millions could die in the United States and other developed countries.
Case 4 — Worst Case Scenario. Pandemic with High CFR.
In the worst case scenario the virus is not contained in China, and it in ends up having a CFR or somewhere between 3%–7%. Maybe the fatality rate is slightly worse than we hope — and healthcare systems become overwhelmed causing the mortality rate to rise substantially. In that case this is The Big One."

From Lobsters and Steak to Coronavirus: One Couple’s Surreal Cruise Nightmare

One sure sign of the regime’s fears is that it failed to stage a parade in central Pyongyang on Saturday, the 72nd anniversary of the founding of the country’s armed forces. Last year, Kim Jong Un himself presided over the procession that displayed the North’s latest missiles and other fearsome hardware along with goose-stepping soldiers in serried ranks.

This year, nothing about the nation’s nuclear warheads, much less the “new strategic weapon” that Kim has vowed to unveil. Rodong Sinmum, the newspaper of the ruling Workers’ Party, merely cited the armed forces’ supposed success combating “severe and dangerous difficulties”—and said nothing at all about the parade.

But reports have filtered out about Kim’s subjects falling prey to coronavirus despite the country’s decision to seal its 880-mile border with China, most of it along the Yalu River into the Yellow Sea to the west, and its 11-mile border with Russia where the Tumen River flows into the Pacific.

Among the first to report fatalities in North Korea, the Seoul-based website Daily NK said five people had died in the critical northwestern city of Sinuiju, on the Yalu River across road and rail bridges from Dandong, which is the largest Chinese city in the region and a key point for commerce with North Korea despite sanctions.

Daily NK, which relies on sources inside North Korea that send reports via Chinese mobile phone networks to contacts in China, said authorities had “ordered public health officials in Sinuiju to quickly dispose of the bodies and keep the deaths secret from the public.”"

Most people live in apartments, which means more contact with people in elevators and stuff. Beijing is a famously overpopulated city in an already overpopulated country. That makes it very easy for the virus to catch on very fast.

Another issue is that a lot of public bathrooms in China dont have soap. I always had to carry around purell when I was there, just in case. Not having easy access to soap in a public place is another complicating factor when dealing with an epidemic like this. Most people do have soap in their homes though.

Furthermore, we have smoking and air pollution. A lot of people in China smoke. Idk if it's gone down in the last few years, and I dont have exact numbers at the moment, but I remember that a lot of people there--especially men--smoked. People at the greatest risk of death from coronavirus are people with preexisting respiratory conditions. I cant imagine that smokers who catch the virus are doing all that well.

Air pollution is a similar issue. Beijing's pollution is at its worst in the winter bc people need to heat their homes, and this adds to Beijing's already terrible pollution problems. People are breathing in PM 2.5 and all kinds of awful things year round, which increases their risk for all kinds of respiratory illnesses. People there are already at risk for all these things, and coronavirus is just the perfect storm here.

And finally, all the hospitals were already over crowded. Their healthcare system has been struggling even before all this. Air and water pollution issues have correlations with increased rates of certain types of cancer and stuff, and every hospital was already packed. (I'll add a source later I promise) 

I think its important to consider living conditions in China when we look at the government's response."

From the 5 principle bulwarks in the article

>**Legitimize fear.** People go into denial because they don't feel entitled to be afraid. The more entitled people feel to be afraid, the less likely they are to go into denial. This is why the message, ""Don't be afraid,"" is a very destructive message in serious circumstances. Much superior is the message, ""Well, of course, you're afraid, I'm afraid too. We're all afraid. We'll get through this together.""

Remember this started with only a few cases in the beginning of January. We are currently over 40k infected and this is very underreported. We are anywhere between 300k-450k at this point in time. Here is a video from renown Prof. Neil Ferguson and his modeling for the virus: [Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALQTdCYGISw)

&#x200B;

Most likely there were a lot more cases when it was initially reported on in December, however the reporters, doctors, journalists, etc. were arrested and silenced and the numbers will inherently be skewed. We know the Chinese are reporting false information of mortality rates because it is exactly 2.1%. They have recently changed what confirmed cases are and if you are not showing symptoms then you are not ""confirmed"" to have the coronavirus.

&#x200B;

What we'll see is continuing new all time highs in the markets is what I speculate as we've just recently closed today at new all time highs. ""Markets are forward looking"", that seems almost null and void at this point wouldn't you say? Something must be wrong. If China closes their factories, wouldn't the markets react? Shouldn't the markets react? Not necessarily so. Remember that JFK was assassinated and 3 days later  market recovered its losses. This is directly from Peter Lynch's book **One Up on Wall Street** [Link to chapter in book](https://books.google.com/books?id=KcJaXu7FVZ0C&pg=PA276&lpg=PA276&dq=jfk+assassination+stock+market+rose+peter+lynch&source=bl&ots=e2OLuIAVFb&sig=ACfU3U30NxiclgI60gkxZ7W2h5LdT2sKaA&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwiX_JeK9MfnAhXOVc0KHQ88Bf8Q6AEwAHoECAsQAQ#v=onepage&q&f=false)

&#x200B;

>On November 22, 1963, I was about to take an exam at Boston College when the news that President Kennedy had been shot spread across the campus. Along with my classmates I went to St. Mary's Hall to pray. The next day I saw in the newspaper that the stock market had fallen less than 3 percent, though trading was halted once the news of the assassination became official. **Three days later the market recovered its losses of November 22, and then some.**

&#x200B;

We may very well be in the midst of a perfect storm from the end of the expansion cycle in the stock market and the black swan being the coronavirus/catalyst. Complacency in investors as you can see with some of the comments telling you you're panicking and not to worry. But like the first link I provided says ""Is a very destructive message."" Only time will tell at this point. We'll have a much better understanding in the next month or so on how bad this all may be. I hope it will blow over. I really do.

So what do you do now? Well for one you need to begin getting some basic necessities like extra food, water, toilet paper, and medication. Prepare yourself for self quarantining and do not go to the hospital if you feel ill unless you need immediate attention. If the virus does come to the States or your country, going to the hospital is almost a guarantee in having a higher potential of being exposed to the virus and other viruses such as influenza. This virus may not have a high mortality rate, but the length of time spent in the hospital is anywhere from 2-3 weeks time. That is a fairly long time for one person to be in the hospital, any 1st world country's medical system will easily be overburdened. Imagine a 2nd or 3rd world country. It will be disastrous.

&#x200B;

As an optimist I hope this virus will be contained. As a realist I know it's most likely too late."

There are a multitude of more likely respiratory infections for you to have come down with. By all means, go to the doctor for assurance and treatment. But don't worry too much yet. Not only is it very unlikely to be a coronavirus infection because of proximity, but symptomatically you don't have a fever. 

That said, the CDC recommends:

If you develop a fever AND symptoms of respiratory illness, such as cough or shortness of breath, within 14 days after travel from China, you should call ahead to a healthcare professional and mention your recent travel or close contact. If you have had close contact with someone showing these symptoms who has recently traveled from this area, you should call ahead to a healthcare professional and mention your close contact and their recent travel.

But I'd say the same of the Swiss Alps and they have an outbreak of the coronavirus there now, and they're having to test schoolchildren because one confirmed case was in a school-aged child. Honestly, I really think if you have family in a safe rural area and you don't have your dream job/gf to give up, then I'd go there now, if I were you, for a few weeks, maybe. Call it a vacation. Give your roommate a couple of weeks and keep in touch by Skype to see if she gets sick. Only because with this kind of thing, by the time you get confirmation that it's bad enough to run away, that's when it's usually too late to run away. No countries who rely on tourism for their economic survival, or even just stability, are reporting real numbers. They're not testing in ways that would catch asymptomatic carriers who are in the incubation phase but contagious nevertheless, as a way of keeping numbers low. I suspect they're all hoping it's going to be mild and manageable, and the deaths will be among the sick elderly who, sadly, are seen as using up a large portion of countries' healthcare funding, in many countries (look up unfunded pension liabilities if you're skeptical of the resentment some bureaucrats might have towards seniors).

A little while ago, people were saying it was stupid to buy masks, that it was paranoia to stock up on them. Now they're sold out all over and governments themselves don't have enough if things get bad. Chinese nurses are complaining that hospitals have run out of masks and they're having to work without them. If you'd asked Reddit about buying masks a little while ago, you would have been called a stupid, hysterical, conspiracy theorists by many.

Summing it up, your average panamanian is ignorant, wants the best at ridiculously low prices, will do the bare minimum amount of work, will be jealeous of others that are ""better"" than him/herself, will try to flaunt money or luxury items whenever possible (like iphones)

most bosses are incompetent, don't have a vision about the future (which is dangerous when running a company, as it allows your rivals to crush you making it impossible for you to catch up with them) and will only act late when things are already out of control. 

Most are racist against east asians. They believe that all asians come from china. They confuse the concepts of east asia, asia, china, japan and korea. 

They believe that all chinese are the same, eat dogs and cats and are infected with the coronavirus. 

How? They believe that all chinese constantly travel to china and get infected, that they can get infected bc a family member recently traveled to china and got infected (which is actually possible) and that eating dogs and cats is a chinese tradition. 

Southeast asians are mistaken for latinos. 

Most are racist out of jealousy: you will often see the chinese driving mercedes, bmw, land rovers and other luxury cars and using the latest iphone or samsung s or note series phone or using a $500 xiaomi. 

Many chinese own and operate convenience stores. They are everywhere. My family used to own and operate one until the 90s.

The education system is terrible, and there is conflict of interest: esl schools will often go to english classes on a yearly basis to promote and advertise their services, and will force students to give away their own and their parent's contact details (phone number, email, billing address)

 the education system is authoritarian, teachers will often dismiss bullying and there are lots of racist teachers and teachers that have sex or that are sexually interested in female seniors. 

It is very hard to get a job on your own. More often than not, you'll need to have someone get it for you.

If you want to be an entepreneur, don't think big. It will fail. If you want to develop or advance some new technology, you'll be better off going to the states or to some asian or european country and doing it there. Here, no investor is willing to take any risk.  There is no such thing as a startup ecosystem or a goverment fund for technology development (like darpa grants or the abu dhabi fund that invests in globalfoundries, i believe norway has a goverment fund too)

We have the highest average salary and internet speeds of any latin american country. But inequality is rampant, and poverty and poor and expensive internet accesd are widespread."

I'm not a physician, I'm a historian of medicine and I'm aware of the information that you cited. However, spreading panic about a virus isn't a good idea either. I'm not arguing that the suppression of information is good, but as a doctor you should know that potentially panicking a population can lead to extreme problems with their reactionary behaviour (panic buying, hoarding resources, overwhelming staff etc).  

I agree that there should be caution, but at present I would advise that people follow the [CDC guidelines](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/about/prevention.html) concerning the novel coronavirus (as I am). Information may change, but at present people should be looking to reputable sources with the least bias, and this Telegraph (a newspaper with bias) article you cite speaks specifically or the viral deaths within Wuhan, and as it itself states it misses information on those who have recovered and/or have milder symptoms. It states later on that we simply don't know the true rate of those infected, and from that there is an argument to be made that we don't understand the virus yet beyond observed cases that may or may not be typical.

TL:DR - close read any sources BUT err to unbiased official guidelines and spreading panic helps no-one especially already stressed and potentially overworked medical staff and infrastructure."

The militaries virologist and tropical disease specialists are working around the clock. Military Logistics are preparing for the worst case scenarios too. 

Is the situation dangerous? Yes definitely. Is it contained and Germany and Europe at the moment ? Yes. Is our government and military prepared and making preparations out of sight of the public eye and highly alarmed to make sure that they don’t miss anything ? Yes.

Aside from the obvious conclusion that going on a cruise in East Asia can be quite dangerous for your health, I think it's becoming clear that novel coronavirus is *very* contagious, and that there are likely thousands of unreported/unconfirmed international cases. We'll probably find about them in a week or two, when they become very ill, of course, assuming everyone with pneumonia of unknown cause gets tested.

On a more positive side, if they test this entire ship, we'll have more reliable information about how serious the infection is."

LUSAKA, Zambia — At a Chinese-run hospital in Zambia, some employees watched as people who recently returned from China showed up with coughs but were not placed in isolation. A doctor tending to those patients has stopped coming to work, and health workers have been ordered not to speak publicly about the new virus that has killed hundreds around the world.

The virus that has [spread through much of China](https://www.statnews.com/2020/01/30/who-declares-coronavirus-outbreak-a-global-health-emergency/) has yet to be confirmed in Africa, but global health authorities are increasingly worried about the threat to the continent where an estimated 1 million Chinese now live, as some health workers on the ground warn they are not ready to handle an outbreak.

Countries are [racing to take precautions](https://www.statnews.com/2020/02/07/hospitals-harnessing-resources-brace-spike-coronavirus-cases/) as hundreds of travelers arrive from China every day. Safeguards include stronger surveillance at ports of entry and improved quarantine and testing measures across Africa, home to 1.2 billion people and some of the world’s weakest systems for detecting and treating disease.

But the effort has been complicated by a critical shortage of testing kits and numerous illnesses that display symptoms similar to the flu-like virus.

“The problem is, even if it’s mild, it can paralyze the whole community,” said Dr. Michel Yao, emergency operations manager in Africa for the World Health Organization.

Those growing worried include employees at the Sino-Zambia Friendship Hospital in the mining city of Kitwe in northern Zambia, near the Congo border. Chinese companies operate mines on the outskirts of the city of more than half a million people. One company is headquartered in Wuhan, the city at the center of the virus outbreak. Hundreds of workers traveled between Zambia and China in recent weeks.

“We’re definitely not prepared. If we had a couple of cases, it would spread very quickly,” physiotherapist Fundi Sinkala said. “We’re doing the best we can with what resources we have.”

The Sino-Zambia Friendship Hospital, or Sinozam, a low-slung facility near the city’s train station, has taken some precautions, including checking patient temperatures with infrared thermometers and establishing isolation areas. Employees wear masks. Gloves, disinfectant and oxygen inhalers have been stockpiled. Sinozam treats many Chinese in Kitwe and its precautions go further than other hospitals in the area.

But the employees and others familiar with the matter, some of whom spoke anonymously under the new rules, say some Chinese patients checked in with coughs and fevers but did not get placed in isolation.

Visiting Zambian health officials concluded the patients did not merit special treatment and did not take samples to test for the virus. After the people recovered, they were sent home with antibiotics, employees said.

On Wednesday, the hospital set up a new fever clinic, to which people arriving with a high temperature are now ushered to right away. It’s “unfortunate” the ward wasn’t set up earlier, Sinkala said.

Two people familiar with the matter say a doctor tending to the sick has fallen ill. Dr. Yu Jianlan has not come to work in the past week and hospital administrators have not explained her absence, Sinkala said. The other person spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of retribution.

Hospital administrator Li Zhibing said there were no patients with a fever and said Yu had a urinary tract infection, not a fever. But a notice posted by the Zambia-China Cooperation Zone, which manages the hospital, quoted an employee as saying on Jan. 27 that the facility “probably sees 120 fever patients a day, and at least 70 of them are carrying germs” of various diseases.

Earlier this week, a Zambian official acknowledged for the first time that his country was following up on an unspecified number of suspected cases. Zambia is one of 13 African countries identified by WHO as a high priority because of busy travel links with China.

Copperbelt provincial health director Dr. Robert Zulu, who oversees Kitwe and the surrounding region, told The Associated Press he would not discuss details, citing privacy. But he added, “when any case is confirmed, you will be informed.”

Crucially, no one in Zambia has been able to test for the virus so far. Like most African countries, it has been waiting for a substance known as a reagent, which labs require to confirm whether a patient is infected. Labs in just six of Africa’s 54 countries were equipped as of mid-week. That means a wait of two or more days to know whether a sample shipped to South Africa or even outside the continent tests positive.

Without testing, officials are “just relying on the symptoms” and whether they persist. “But from what we are learning right now, some people show hardly any symptoms at all,” Sinkala said, calling that the hospital’s biggest worry.

Zambia is one of the additional countries WHO planned to equip by the end of the week. As of Friday, WHO emergencies chief Dr. Mike Ryan said 28 labs across the continent could diagnose the new virus.

Adding to concerns at Sinozam, three employees say Zambian health officials visited on Tuesday and have been testing the bodies of two Chinese patients that have been in the morgue for days, though some added it was out of an overabundance of caution.

Li, however, dismissed the accounts of testing the bodies as “rumors.” He said one died last month of malaria and the other of a heart attack. The bodies are still there because family members in China wish to come and pay respects but cannot because of the outbreak, he said.

Zambia’s health ministry spokesman, Dr. Abel Kabalo, called the employee accounts of events at the hospital “very strange.” He vowed that if Zambia confirms a case, authorities “will definitely inform the world.”

It’s “pointless to hide information,” Kabalo said.

The WHO says countries are obligated to inform it of any confirmed cases and are requested to report suspected cases as well. The WHO chief has publicly urged countries to share information. So far, African countries appear to be complying, a WHO adviser on health security, Dr. Ambrose Talisuna, told reporters.

Several African nations such as Ghana, South Africa and Ethiopia have announced their precautions, including updates on negative test results for suspected cases and demonstrations of surveillance and quarantine capabilities. Ethiopian Airlines, however, faces questions by some in Africa about why it continues to operate more than 30 China flights a week while other African airlines have suspended theirs.

Adding to the difficulties in diagnosing the new virus are numerous diseases in Africa with symptoms that include fever or coughing or both.

It’s impossible to diagnose the new virus by symptoms alone, Gates Foundation CEO Mark Suzman said, adding that there is a “significant likelihood” that the virus will be confirmed in Africa. And there is a risk that “panic overtakes good public health and good science.”

The foundation has committed up to $20 million to help health authorities in Africa and South Asia, another vulnerable region, improve their disease surveillance, isolation and treatment for the virus.

Concerns are high among some in Kitwe. A local pharmacy manager, Edward Goma, estimated that his business had sold more than 800 face masks in the past few days.

“So far everyone is scared,” he said. And yet he has not noticed the stricter surveillance measures seen in other countries, beyond temperature checks at the international airport an hour’s drive away.

The 15th Metallurgical Construction Group, based in Wuhan, said on its website that its overseas operations in Zambia and Congo must purchase masks, disinfect living quarters and workspaces daily and check workers’ temperatures three times a day.

Chinese employees are temporarily barred from returning to Africa, while those in Zambia are not allowed to go to China, said Li, the hospital administrator.

Chinese embassies in Zambia and elsewhere in Africa have been unusually outspoken, giving news conferences and television interviews to discuss their response to the outbreak. Embassies require arriving Chinese citizens to declare where they have been in China. They also urge citizens to voluntarily isolate themselves for 14 days.

“We are now practicing hygiene, even in the mines,” said the Kitwe-based president of the Mine Workers Union of Zambia, Joseph Chewe. “Any report of a person with coronavirus here will be very disastrous.”"

That is to say that all follow one or more periods during a year where they are more frequent, most often with spikes during those more frequent periods.  Offseason they can have minimal or no activity.  This is notably how both the common-cold-causing group of coronaviruses and MERS-CoV works.

Research looking as the seasonality of MERS and influenza A demonstrates a simularity to, but not a concordance with each other:  Flu season is not necessarily coronavirus season, although that doesn't preclude them from being the same, either.  Different latitudes have different seasonality.  Absolute climate temperature is not an predictable guide for the prevalence of coronaviruses.

Edit:  but as has been mentioned elsewhere, outside of a host, warmer and hotter tend to be worse for coronaviruses, all things being equal.  The comparative coronavirus should be SARS-CoV, but SARS-CoV never reoccurred, so we don't know its seasonality (if any) with precision."

The people traveled in large numbers all the way to end of January and the ability of the virus to stay potent on surfaces for 9 days surely infected more than 12. Because of the above and the fact we all live far apart from each other the spread will take much longer than it did in China.  
It took 2 months for China to spread so  by end of March we will see the clear picture. They finally developed the test kit and started stocking it 4 days ago.

Another similar and deadly coronavirus, MERS, is carried by camels.  Zoonotic diseases are common. The last major pandemic (spanish flu) was no bioweapon (hell we barely new anything about genetics or cellular biology back then) and also came from live animals. HIV also for that matter. The most likely explanation at the moment is zoonotic disease from a wet market. All novel zoonotic diseases go through a list of various potential animal carriers as scientists conduct research (SARS: Civets and then bats, MERS: bats and then camels and then maybe again bats, Ebola: monkeys and then bats...lots of bats).

I think there is some poetic justice to this being natural. Every year diatom plankton bloom in our oceans. Massive exponential growth. Then they all die...killed by viruses. Our bloom will come to an end one way or another. Nature tends to find a way to correct imbalances."

Additionally medication management for confirmed cases has changed since this started. FDA has given compassionate release of remdesivir, which was in clinical trials, and last week treatment using it started in China. In the research article that was released on therapeutic management and health outcomes in Wuhan, they seem to have only been giving patients antibiotics which would only help secondary pneumonia not the virus. Lastly, smokers have a up regulated receptor subtype (I forgot the name of it) that coronavirus specifically binds to. Smoking is highly prevalent in Chinese society, specifically in men. We already have skewed data in terms of infection rates on men vs. women in China (I believe it’s ~60 vs 40%).

From that list you'd see that a majority of them are not from China. That said, there are several reasons why some places in the world might be more likely to see the start of more zoonotic transmission of disease. Any place with a lot of mixing between people, farm animals, and wildlife will increase the odds of zoonotic transmission. This isn't just a China thing though."

I did a meet&greet a few years ago (2016) in Dallas, TX; I walked down the line, did the handshake-into-bro-hug thing with each of them. We posed for a couple pictures (this M&G had a professional photographer that posted the pics online somewhere, so NO CELL PHONES ALLOWED, and they were strict about it). There were only a few seconds to shoot the bull (""hey, \*insert album/song name here\* was awesome, keep it up!"" or ""hey Mark, I tried doing the exercises on your DVD, but you do it so fast and effortlessly that it makes me question why I picked this goofy instrument up in the first place. So thanks for that."" You know, something like that; they're not going to do a Q&A or anything. Same thing, signed poster and goods; the boys aren't touching a Sharpie.

Last October, I did Mark's guitar / songwriting clinic. It's everything it's advertised to be and more. The sit-down part lasted a good hour; Mark answered individual questions - actually took an interest in whatever was being asked and made sure he answered it thoroughly. Joked around with us, you could tell he enjoys doing the clinics. Then we got a stage/rig tour that lasted another 15-20 minutes, followed up by pictures. After my picture was taken, we were told to meet back in the lobby and wait for sound check. Well, on my way off the stage, Flip was getting ready to hop on his drum kit, so I slid over, shook his hand, and we talked for a couple minutes about the new album. He probably would have let me take a selfie with him, but I don't ever think to do that. Just a cool dude. OH! I forgot, Mark also took the time to sign folks guitars (PRS or not) for those that wanted that; he also signed a few other things (a vinyl and maybe a hat, I don't remember). 

As for the soundcheck, same as you said: it's three songs, Myles hardly sings much on any of them, which is fine. By the way, I wouldn't take the Myles thing personally; I'm pretty sure he's a major introvert, so I don't think he means to come across that way if he did. Plus, the no autographs thing is a management policy to not have everyone held up. The M&G was right after soundcheck, but I didn't do it that time. Actually, I've met the guys, so I don't imagine I'd do another one. The clinics though - if I have the funds - I would do those every time. You don't even have to play guitar, or bring one, to enjoy the clinic. 

PS. Now that I think about it, when I met them, there wasn't anything going on as far as widespread flu or Coronavirus or anything like that going on, so that's probably why there were restrictions for hugging and whatnot. Better to be safe than sorry, even if it does make for a less-than-personable experience."

This is definitely negatively impacting their economy. And since they are a main cog in the world economy, it will begin to hurt our economy, ie, a recession.

There was an interview on Caixin a few days ago with a doctor from Wuhan:  [https://www.straitstimes.com/asia/east-asia/reporters-notebook-life-and-death-in-a-wuhan-coronavirus-icu](https://www.straitstimes.com/asia/east-asia/reporters-notebook-life-and-death-in-a-wuhan-coronavirus-icu) 

Quote: "" Wuhan 7th Hospital is in a partnership with our hospital, South Central Hospital. The deputy director went there to help in their ICU. He found that two-thirds of the medical staff in the ICU were already infected. Doctors there were running ""naked"" as they knew they were set to be infected given the shortage of protective gear. They still worked there nonetheless. That was why ICU medical staff were almost all sickened. ""

In a video on Chinese state TV where Li Keqiang visited the doctors you could clearly see that they were wearing only regular, disposable surgical masks. Those masks could be a good protection on the streets, but they arent enough in hospitals where you have to move around patients. With those mask on, the question isnt that ""if they get infected"", but ""when they get infected"". It is like a kamikaze action. So i am very curious how much healthy medical workers they have in Wuhan right now. (There is no data about this... anyways, take a look at Li Wenliang. He was an ophthalmologist (eye doctor) and he was ordered to deal with infectious patients. I think they havent got enough doctors with the proper knowledge. To take care of infectious patients, you will need very specialised knowledge, a doctor without that specific knowledge will get infected very soon.)

Plus i think they are working in 2 shifts/day which means half of the available staff is working in a shift. You can take into account that some of them need to do tests and admit new patients. Others need to do administrative stuffs like ordering and distributing drugs and medical equipment. There are a lot of things in hospitals which need to be done by somebody. And of course Wuhan is a city with 10 million inhabitans. Those inhabitans have regular diseases, like heart attack, stroke, etc. These conditions require emergency treatment and they need to be taken care of, too."

But this disease hit the sweet spot of being insidious enough that people may not even seek medical help thinking it’s a cold or flu, making it more likely they spread it unknowingly. 

Just like the flu, it’s the most troubling for people with compromised immune systems. So maybe you’d be okay, but you might give it to someone else who won’t be.

Unleashing a disease that kills mainly the old and weak who are not providing the desired work output seems like a good way to do that.

But of course, the reality is that young and healthy folks are dying too. Maybe they're willing to pay that price, but at this point the losses are staggering. They've lost many many billions of dollars and have many millions quarantined. They're lying about the numbers of infected and dead, hell, they're not even testing people. 

There's not enough tests and they're not counting anyone who isn't confirmed to have it in the tolls. So anyone who dies at home is not counted as a novel coronavirus death.

2020-02-10,CanBurritosFeelLove,investing,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/f1w6pz/global_pandemic/fh9a94g/,"Listen, the numbers are there. Unless you think that every country is suppressing the number of cases, it's already been +2 incubation cycles since the virus emerged and we haven't seen anything to signal an impending pandemic anywhere. Everyone who has got it so far was in close contact with someone who traveled to Asia during the outbreak. The virus might not be affected by International borders but it sure as hell is affected by population density. Why do you think this is only out of hand in China? 

Nothing has happened. That's why the markets are reacting the way they are. At the peak of the quarantine 4% of China's population was out of work for a week. 

As for your last point, there has NEVER been some apocalyptic sickness in recorded history that had it happened today, would wipe everyone out. The plague, Spanish Flu, Cholera, all of them would've been either non-issues or no bigger than this Coronavirus had they happened today. For example, the Spanish flu was made a million times worse because it happened during a world war where medical supplies and practitioners we're super stretched. In wealthy western countries that weren't war torn, the mortality rate of the Spanish flu was only around 1-2% (see Denmark for example). The Plague and Cholera are around today and we successfully avoid any sort of spread with treatment. What you're describing is like worrying about an asteroid coming out of nowhere and wiping us out. Yes it could happen, but it's almost certainly not going to. You're not special, the odds of you being around for the end of the world are almost 0. You're probably going to die in an accident or from heart disease or other chronic disease at an old age like everyone else. 

But that shit doesn't scare you into clicking on a bunch of articles about how the Spanish Flu killed everyone and how Coronavirus is the new Spanish Flu."

Personally, I'm a teacher in special ed and I sent home two students with crazy high fevers and debilitating coughs today (I have 6-7 students per class total). Out of our department we had over a 50% absentee rate. That never happens. On Friday I sent one student home with high fever and cough. Of those 3 students , 2 already have had the flu.

#Cases

[As of Feb 9, 2020] (https://gisanddata.maps.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html#/bda7594740fd40299423467b48e9ecf6) we have total 40536 confirmed cases:

* 910 deaths
* 3378 recovered
* 36248 unresolved 

From this we can calculate, that *out of the resolved cases*:

    (910 deaths) / (4288 total resolved) = 21% died and 79% recovered

We have to keep in mind that it takes longer for person to recover than to die from the illness, and hospitals do tests only for the most severely ill ones, so the above calculation isn't a good representation of the actual chances of dying of this flu.

#World Health Organization

The only number given out by World Health Organization (WHO) so far has been a case fatality rate (CFR), which is the number of deaths divided by total confirmed cases. 

    (910 deaths) / (40536 confirmed cases) = 2% case fatality rate

While this is the correct way to calculate case fatality rate, this number doesn't give accurate estimation of the actual mortality rate of the flu, because it is an ongoing situation where majority of the confirmed cases are still unresolved. We don't have the information of whether the unresolved cases end up recovering or dying.

WHO themselves mentioned in the same [press conference](https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/media-resources/press-briefings#): ""*The only number currently known is how many people have died out of those who have been reported to the WHO...it is therefore very early to make any conclusive statements about what the overall mortality rate will be*"".

#The Lancet Study

https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(20)30211-7/fulltext

A study published in The Lancet on January 30 tracked 99 confirmed cases from Wuhan Jinyintan Hospital. Death rate in that study was **11%**. We have to keep in mind that people in this study were not young an healthy to begin with.

https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2761044

The JAMA Network study, released in February 7 looked at 138 cases of hospitalized patients at Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University in Wuhan, China. In this study, mortality rate was **4.3%**. 

#Reported Numbers vs Reality

The reported numbers only include those who have been tested positive for the virus. A lot of the actual infections will go undiagnosed because China has reached their maximum capacity to test. Hospitals don't have enough test kits to test everyone. Also, majority of people with symptoms will choose to stay at home instead of going to the overcrowded hospitals where infected are gathered and spreading the virus around.  There have even been cases where people were tested positive for the virus and had no symptoms at all, so we really have no idea of the true number of infected people. However, we can safely assume that total number of infected is much much more than the reported confirmed cases.

There's also the very likely possibility that even the reported numbers are inaccurate, as China's officials could be reporting much lower numbers (of both infected and dead) for various political and economic reasons. 

Even if the true number of deaths would be a lot higher than reported, which is likely is because undiagnosed patients are not included in the statistics of the virus, the actual number of infected could easily be higher than 500 000 which means the mortality rate is still low. It's very unlikely that mortality rate of this illness ends up being higher than **5%**.

#Comparison

For comparison, the case fatality rate of similar viruses and seasonal flu: 

* SARS (**11%**)
* MERS (**35%**)
* Seasonal Flu (**less than 0.08%.**)"

That lowers the chance that the virus will evolve in some catastrophic way to, say, become significantly more lethal.

On top of that, calling it ""worthy karma"".

That managed to get a lot of Chinese students angry, especially on Instagram. I haven't seen this level of outrage on the party's other social media though.

The (mostly international) Chinese York students are upset, but knowing how most of them aren't keen on campus politics, I'm not sure if they will mobilize and vote against Unite YU starting tomorrow. Especially since the person did eventually step down from running with Unite YU, which was what many of them wanted. They didn't exactly say they wanted Unite YU to be completely eliminated.

I, on the other hand, am appalled with how they decided to keep the candidate in their party, even after her anti-Chinese racist comment. I'm committed to vote when the period starts.

\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*

This aside, now addressing your last sentence, there's a few possible factors that I can think of, that gives Unite YU the upper hand and hold their seats for over 15 years, besides overall low voter turnout:

* Accessibility: their online platforms and presence are accessible in the sense that they put image descriptions with their pictures and other promotional material. They have a website that comes with an accessibility version of it, for disabled people to use.
* Adding onto this point, to be fair, most of the elections material are written in English. So I think this is a trade-off with the things listed in the first point. Non-native English speakers might have trouble tuning in due to the language barrier.
* They disclose their pronouns on each candidate's profile. Yeah that sounds trivial, but this act shows that they're aware of people such as transgender and nonbinary students on campus, and in turn they are trying to normalize... not assuming people's gender based on their appearance. Trivial to perhaps most of you, but very considerate in the eyes these marginalized groups. It lets them know they are safe to approach, as non-cisgender people.
* While scrolling through this subreddit's past threads on student elections, a big factor is their election budget. I guess being an incumbent and having a big team, they seem to have a huge budget for printing out posters and flyers. Something about their budget being calculated according to one election by-law York has.
* If I get my facts right, I think most of the advertising for their group are done by volunteers. And you can imagine they have a big pool of volunteers to help them out.
* Last but not least, political apathy and inconvenience. Many people here are here just to learn and leave. Not to mention that voting takes place when midterms usually happen.

As much as it's understandable to think the YFS needs their student party changed (especially after 15 years of holding seats. That's a long time), it's hard when other competing parties/individuals don't have the budget, let alone knowledge on these other factors."

That's exactly like me claiming that all white people are inbred because people in Alabama marry their cousins or that all black people should be feared as carrying HIV. Honestly this conversation isn't even about the Coronavirus but racism in general, which minorities deal with constantly. This type of casual racist quips are said to minorities everywhere. How many black people haven't heard some variation of ""black people commit the most crimes"" or Hispanics haven't heard ""oh I'm only talking about the illegal immigrants"" or ""you're one of the good ones"".

There's been 12 reported cases in the US. Meanwhile more than 10k has died from the influenza flu. And we have 20 airports that are actively checking for the flu and all travel is prohibited in and out of wuhan china as an extra precaution along with random virus checks on the streets of wuhan. I understand that you dont think that's part of your job but it's more of a precaution saying hey if your items say 10 and you have 1 bag you should probably check in with the staff and see what's up. I would advise anyone who thinks they may have been in contact with the Coronavirus and call a hospital and tell them you are coming to get checked out for the coronavirus so they can properly give you and others a sanitized environment where you are away from them and are so they are able to contain the virus. And you should not be delivering food if you think you've been in contact with the virus as it's very easily spread and dangerous (even deadly in poor living environments and a lack of availability to healthcare.) And it's also notable that people have recovered from the coronavirus. So please stop trying to blow this virus out of proportion because it's really not that serious

You seem well spoken, and I’m glad you’re doing better, but it’s the same as faking autism for attention, or the coronavirus, or any other legitimate medical concern. This is unacceptable because it creates a stigma for the individuals who actually have to struggle in day to day life, like you and I. However, while people do struggle, a few bad days here and there IS NOT clinical depression. It’s a hard time. We can help people through hard times, but it’s repugnant when people fake any illness.

China struggles to return to business after extended break
Foxconn and other tech suppliers strain to restart production

 UPDATED ON FEBRUARY 11, 2020 02:10 JST

TOKYO -- Hopes that the Chinese economy would return to normal on Monday after an extended Lunar New Year holiday have taken a hit as several companies announced they will remain closed due to concerns over the coronavirus.

Consumer goods makers, leisure facility operators, steelmakers are among those postponing operations, according to filings with the Shanghai, Shenzhen and Hong Kong stock exchanges, as the death toll from the virus topped 900.

The majority of announced delays are from companies operating in Wuhan, the city hardest-hit by the outbreak. Wuhan Hanshang Group, which runs shopping malls, wedding photo shops, and a convention center in the city, shuttered all of its facilities on Jan. 23 and has given no indication of when operations will resume.


The day before the suspension, the Shanghai-listed company announced that its 2019 net profit jumped by about 50% from the year before, based on its preliminary estimate. This year's bottom line, however, will likely take a hit from the prolonged period of closure.

Major food chain Jiumaojiu International Holdings said on Sunday evening that it will extend the suspension of all its restaurants, both self-operated and franchised locations, which have been closed since Jan. 29. The company, which listed in Hong Kong just last month, operates 287 restaurants directly and 41 others as franchises, in four major cities and 15 provinces, including Wuhan, in Hubei Province, according to its prospectus published at year-end.

Meanwhile, China's technology supply chain remains at a near standstill. Key suppliers to Apple are straining to restart production of iPhones, iPads and other devices amid concerns that the coronavirus could spread through factories and the dormitories where thousands of workers live in close quarters.

Some of Apple's key iPhone production sites in China were given approval by local health officials to resume production after they had completed health inspection audits on Sunday night, sources told the Nikkei Asian Review. However, issues have been found in some facilities, including the world's biggest iPhone production site in Zhengzhou,  Henan Province, operated by Foxconn. Facilities where red flags have been raised will be required to have daily public health inspections, the sources said.  

 Most of the key iPhone assemblers, including Foxconn -- which trades as Hon Hai Precision Industry -- Pegatron and Wistron, are aiming to restart work as soon as Tuesday. But worker shortages remain a significant hurdle. 

""Whether we resume work or not is not the point. The point is whether we have enough workers or not,"" an iPhone supply chain source familiar with the situation told Nikkei.

Shangai-listed Cabio Bioengineering (Wuhan), meanwhile, is grappling with the city's paralyzed transportation network. The food ingredient producer says its factory, located in an economic development zone on Wuhan's outskirts, is ""unable to resume operation as scheduled"" because public transportation suspensions are preventing employees from coming to work. The company also mentioned in its disclosure that ""various companies in Hubei Province cannot resume operation before midnight on Feb. 13, based on a recent circular from the authorities.""

Travel disruptions are also preventing companies outside of Wuhan from getting back to work as scheduled. China Vanadium Titano-Magnetite Mining announced on Friday that the operations of its Maoling Mine in Sichuan province will remain suspended after the prolonged holidays. The Hong Kong-listed company said that ""a significant portion"" of site workers who carry out underground operations in the magnetite mine are from Hubei and Zhejiang provinces and ""will be unable to return to work.""

Hengxing Gold Holding is also delaying the resumption of mining, originally scheduled for Monday. The company said on Friday that it is ""uncertain"" when its Gold Mountain Mine in Xinjiang will be able to restart, subject to government approval and ""the return of the workforce."" The Hong Kong-listed miner predicts ""less gold production in the first quarter."" The mine produced 25,313 ounces, or 787.3 kg, of gold during the fourth quarter and 85,654 oz for all of 2019.

""Chinese brick-and-mortar retailers selling discretionary items, travel-service providers and transportation companies are most exposed to disruptions stemming from the coronavirus outbreak,"" a team of analysts led by Cedric Lai at Moody's Investor Service said on Friday. ""These disruptions include transportation suspensions, travel bans and reduced customer traffic flows,"" which is affecting wide range of sectors.

New Building Materials is set to resume operations in stages. Its medicine and medical equipment units will ""gradually resume"" from Monday, the Shenzhen-listed Wanbangde company said, while its aluminum material producing subsidiary is expected to pick up from Wednesday onward.

For the service sector, the worst damage may have already been done, as the outbreak hit during the high-demand Chinese New Year holiday season.

China Film had to close down all 141 of its movie theaters across the country during the break, while its Shanghai-listed peers Shanghai Film and Hengdian Entertainment were in a similar situation. No figures have been released yet, but China Film's box office sales during the seven-day holiday season last year was 144.03 million yuan ($20.6 million), which made up 8% of its annual ticket sales revenue.

The impact of the outbreak is in hitting less-expected areas, too. China Oriented International Holdings has suspended the operation of its two driving schools. The Hong Kong-listed company says reopening the schools is ""strictly prohibited"" without the permission of the authorities. The company has not said whether it has received that permission.

Even companies that have managed to resume operations are warning of potential difficulties to come. Hunan Valin Iron & Steel Group says production is ""stable"" for the time being, but added that if work at construction sites is further delayed, it will ""consider decreasing production.""

Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp., a major Chinese chip foundry, is ""working hard to maintain the uninterrupted state of manufacturing operations"" according to its disclosure to the Hong Kong Exchange on Friday. The strategically important tech company is standing firm, but Chairman Zhou Zixue, acknowledged in the statement: ""The current prevention and control of the novel coronavirus is serious and the task is arduous.""

SMIC's statement comes as Foxconn is taking extraordinary steps to restart production -- even going so far as to begin manufacturing its own surgical masks for employees.   

Another complication for Foxconn and other tech suppliers has been conflicting messages from local and central governments in China, leading to questions about when they can -- or should -- restart production. 

""The current status is that both manufacturers and governments do hope people could come back to work and manufacturing, as those are crucial to steady economic performance. But none of the parties want to be too aggressive, as no one could shoulder that kind of risk and responsibility,"" one of the sources familiar with the matter said. ""All the suppliers are in many different areas of China, and all the local governments have different regulations.""

Among Japanese companies, tiremaker Bridgestone was expected to restart factories Monday in Wuxi, Tianjin and other cities, but the reopening has been delayed due to the difficulty in securing enough workers. Operations now are expected to resume within a week.

Mazda Motor and Isuzu Motors have postponed resumption of Chinese factories as well. Toyota Motor intends to restart operations at Chinese plants no sooner than Feb. 17.

""There will be no work until the 17th,"" said a senior manager at a Guangzhou supplier for Toyota's plants. ""We have no choice but to sit at home.""

An auto parts maker in Guangzhou restarted production lines Monday, but ""personnel was about 60% of the normal level,"" an employee said.

Xi has always known this and he has always maintained a large presence in Chinese media, appearing almost every day. However, this changed when Xi went silent six days ago.Chinese leader Xi Jinping died of the coronavirus yesterday. His absence for the last six days was due to the fact that he contracted the virus early on when he met with microbiologists from the Wuhan BSL4 lab to assess the situation in Wuhan. At the time it wasn't known that asymptomatic carriers were contagious. Almost the entire lab staff was infected before they realized the virus had escaped quarantine. The lab staff that met Xi were trying to save their own skin so they lied about the virus to XI, claiming that humans couldn't spread it to other humans. During the meeting Xi and all his senior advisors were infected. Most are now dead.

 Xi's death is being covered up while they search for a body-double to replace him. The next time you see him publicly, it won't be Xi Jinping. That's is they find a suitable replacement. World leaders know this already and they are all hoping that a double can be found because the damage to global confidence and panic it would cause if this got out."

If you want something extra like more steppers or more powerful drivers than the TMC2209 then look at the other SKR boards. If you wait there will always be better boards, whether it's with BTT or another manufacturer. Frankly, I got the v1.2 because it has the TMC2209 at an amazing price, the UART or DIP version were twice the price. I don't see much reason for BTT to come out with a new revision of the mini E3, it's got everything an Ender user needs. BTT have other boards if you need non-Ender features.

  


The numbering/naming scheme from BTT is not well thought-out, so perhaps that's the confusion about the ""mini E3 v1.3"", there is a v1.3 board but it is not a drop in replacement for the Ender3.

  


One thing to consider is that China is in lockdown with the CoronaVirus. So I predict a shortage of many Chinese products for a few months until supply chains are back to normal. I've not seen any of my AliExpress packages moving for a couple of weeks. So if you order the SKR mini E3 v1.2, I'd suggest you try an Amazon supplier that has stock in the US or Europe. Even if there are new fancy boards in the pipeline, the flu outbreak will cause delays and BTT will have a backlog of existing order once there back up and running.

  


If anyone that works for BTT reads this sub-reddit, it would be reassuring to hear that you are all OK."

Race and health refers to how being identified with a specific race influences health. Race is a complex concept that changes across time and space and that depends on both self-identification and social recognition. In the study of race and health, scientists organize people in racial categories depending on different factors such as: phenotype, ancestry, social identity, genetic makeup and lived experience. “Race” and ethnicity often remain undifferentiated in health research.Differences in health status, health outcomes, life expectancy, and many other indicators of health in different racial and ethnic groups are well documented.

as for link 2: it says plainly in the title ""not the *only* source"". I agree. I also think that this focus on one, particular seafood market seems odd. There were several markets in Wuhan selling bats and snakes. Not just a single, seafood market.

And from what I can tell, the use of the word ""market"" for these meats, is more as a whole market, not just a single place. Like black market - not just one location. But the whole market - of people and places to buy and sell these meats.

The 3rd link is just a reiteration of the 2nd link. 

All 3 seem like Chinese minimalist ""news"". 

I submit -

Shutting down, or pin pointing one single seafood market is not the issue. There is a market for these animals, and their meat, outside of that one location. It seems that they have now banned this type of animal sales, so hopefully, the virus will have a chance to run its course, and fade away."

I developed a sore throat the 29th and a dry cough a day and a half later.  On Friday Feb 7th, I decided to call the designated hotline because two weeks of fever was getting ughhhh. The lady on the phone took my information then repeated my address to me before asking if I had called previously from another until within the building. I had not. 

She advised me to go see a dr within six hours. 
I could only get an appointment earlier today. The dr didn’t take my temperature- he touched my forehead and neck (no gloves or mask!!!) and listened to my lungs with a stethoscope then gave me the all clear.

To be fair, I am feeling better today and my cough is practically gone. I’d have cancelled my dr appointment but I felt it was the responsible thing to keep it so that my information could be recorded as needed (plus I topped up my scripts for migraine meds. 2birds 1stone.) 

I don’t disagree with the doctor that I’m fine *now* but I was surprised at how lax the system for identification and containment is.


FWIW, an alert was sent out for Haymarket to be on the lookout for legionnaires disease... it has the same symptoms as coronavirus. https://7news.com.au/lifestyle/health-wellbeing/haymarket-sydney-residents-warned-to-look-out-for-legionnaires-disease-after-cooling-tower-contamination-c-687854"

> On Feb. 10, local food delivery company Honestbee announced that it would temporarily suspend operations at its habitat supermarket and dining space in Pasir Panjang till Feb. 23, 2020.

> Although the closure is slated to be till Feb. 23, the company has stated that it would “extend the closure if necessary”, Vulcan Post reports.

> Advertisement

> This is due to “public health safety reasons” in light of the “increase in novel coronavirus cases” and the “elevated DORSCON (Disease Outbreak Response System Condition) risk assessment status”.

> According to The Straits Times, a statement by Honestbee also attributed the decision to “a significant reduction in walk-in traffic”.

> While the physical supermarket and dining space will be closed, Honestbee’s online grocery delivery services will still continue as per normal.

> Stocks wiped out at other supermarkets and online delivery companies

> Over the weekend, hoards of people began stockpiling food and household items at many supermarkets all over the island in response to the change in DORSCON status from yellow to orange.

> Advertisement

> On Feb. 9, online delivery company RedMart also saw a huge surge in orders till there were no more delivery slots until Feb. 15.

> Certain food items were sold out as well, such as the popular South Korean instant noodle Shin Ramyun.

> PM Lee and other ministers respond to hoarding

> In response to all the hoarding, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong said in a speech on Feb. 8 that Singaporeans should stay calm in the face of the coronavirus outbreak.

> He also reassured Singaporeans that there is no need to stock up on essential supplies, as Singapore possesses ample supplies.

> Other ministers who have come forth to speak out about this matter include Trade and Industry Minister Chan Chun Sing as well as Minister for Social and Family Development Desmond Lee.

There is quite big difference between highly populated area like China or the majority of the EU.         

But now we are not talking about initial spread of the virus but about situation where we already have serious pandemic.         

What this mean is we will see increased measures due to this (and tbh the sooner the better) that will affect all the people. (tbh for example air traffic should be limited across the world for at least a month)             

This don't change the fact that situation in China will only get worse.     
I hope i am wrong, but i expect tens of thousands if not hundreds of thousands dead in China before situation improves.      

This is not only people dying to coronavirus - but also to some more common sickness that will be untreated as there simply will be no capacity to handle them or by people to afraid to go to hospital to seek help."

There were only like 10k infections 2 weeks ago or less. It's making SARS look like a pinkeye outbreak because total infections are what establish a virus and established viruses are what cumulatively kill people. Even with modern medicine the FLU is a pretty successful murder machine and this virus is worse in almost every way.

At some point the most likely outcome is we all accept there is a new common cold that can kill you or damage your lungs and we all just move on and wash our hands and fear sick people more or at least until a good treatment is created. In this case you probably need a treatment more than a vaccine, but corona virus treatments are not common either. A coronavirus has the fun ability to have very short lived antibodies meaning you have almost not chance of building any lasting resistance. You might be resistant for a few months, if at all. It kind of depends on how many drugs that had to give you in order for you to recover. 

It won't mass kill people, but it will probably become the common cold that kills people.

China is prone to mass panic over disease outbreaks like this, and Chinese hospitals are already overwhelmed as is. For example, over the past few years there have been many viral social media posts about how awful it is to get a hospital bed in China. There have been some western articles about it too:

[https://www.pri.org/stories/2016-04-11/want-see-doctor-china-wait-line-or-pay-illegal-scalper-jump-it-you](https://www.pri.org/stories/2016-04-11/want-see-doctor-china-wait-line-or-pay-illegal-scalper-jump-it-you)

During regular cold season, and especially around Lunar New Year, hospitals are already swarmed. It gets so bad that people attack and even murder their doctors for mistreating them or ignoring them.

[https://time.com/15185/chinas-doctors-overworked-underpaid-attacked/](https://time.com/15185/chinas-doctors-overworked-underpaid-attacked/)

Add on fears about a new killer virus, and it's a recipe for mass panic and riots. The chinese government doesn't really give a shit about poor old people dying from pneumonia, but it REALLY cares about mass anti-government sentiment sweeping through social media. The city wide quarantine and crackdown on ""misinformation"" is the central government panicking over social unrest.

Additionally, I think US media has been extremely irresponsible with this. There are lots of things right here in the US that are far more likely to kill elderly or immunocompromised people. MRSA, c dificile, resistant e coli, and plain old flu. A shiny new virus is exciting, and it's worrying that there's yet another novel coronavirus that has jumped from animals to humans, but so far it's just not convincing that it's a huge problem for people that have access to basic medical care."

The Congress and ""Medical Teams"" met, officials are asking why did we not close our borders and ground plans, Medical team makes it about Politics but in saying, they are also saying its too late. They believe that the infection is already spreading and that there is no way to stop it. 

So most of the discussion is talking about mitigation of the fallout from outbreaks and then the policy that was already in place to combat these things.  

I do not follow our comment on politics anymore,  But Trump's administration has disbanded and fired the groups we had in place to combat outbreaks.  So they had to put together another panel to handle this outbreak which is the White House Coronavirus Taskforce. So basically we had no one watching our backs for possible outbreaks in America. 

Then in between discussion, we find that everything about the virus itself is still an unknown.  

To me it was jarring and a shock to the system to learn how unprepared we are for something like this.

The community looks dumb, people take note of this, and the reputational issues of this space don't outweigh the fundamentals or tech.

You thinking btc is great for XYZ reasons, is fine, and I agree.

You underestimating how the poor rep of this space effects people from entering is poor analysis.

Institutions don't have an interest to jump in to a product like this for a myriad of reasons, some of which include security, regulatory, inability to quantify price, volatility, lack of knowledge, and reputation.

Lets agree that infrastructure has blown up over the last several years, and put ICO scams aside. 

Do you think the reputation has been anything but abysmal during that time? 

It hasn't. 

Bitcoin's success in the long run will come as the millenial version of gold, the same way that Robin Hood and other products outside of financial services, such as Uber, social media, and e-commerce have. 

The idea of pension funds, large institutions, and even the mainstream financial services industry selling crypto products, is years away. 

Take a look at gbtc's quarterly or annual report for a better idea of how little they care. The CME saying they'd *tame* bitcoin, is pretty good indicator of sentiment from **that** world.

So, the question here is simple - do you value these 0.01 BTC holders or not? The run up in 17 was purely based off of a global media frenzy on an otherwise unknown product. 

Similiar to the Coronavirus situation now, only you ""could"" make life changing money and live out your wildest fantasies. Your *customer base* in the present **is** retail en masse.

The market in 2020 has a lot more liquidity than it did in 2017. 

Money flow, reflexivity, and the correlation between price sensitivity and liquidity, mean we need to see signicantly more money come in, or signicantly more money exit in order for price to move significantly, *especially up*. 

This will rebalance the situation and set us up for our next run up. 

So while I do agree with you that a bunch of kiddies with a fraction of a btc upvoting poor quality posts, that confirm their narrative bias, don't validate the posts, they make the community look dumb. 

Reputation has a funny way of working against you, and I've personally seen redditors flat out say the thing that's keeping them on the fence from jumping in, is the shit they're reading on here."

Lmk if you need help or advice. Fucking with the bars will make adjusting the throttle, clutch, and brake cables annoying. Not worth it. Especially the throttle cable, which is unique on this bike.

I upgraded the system to 12V using an Antigravity battery. If you go this route, I'd advise getting one of the newer ones with a BMS installed because any parasitic drain that you don't notice in time could put a LiPo below safe recharge levels.

If you go to 12V, you'll need to replace the headlight, taillight, blinkers, [flasher relay](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B011BTMDQM/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o09_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1) (this one is for LEDs, which will not draw enough power to switich properly without adding [resistors](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07DTBJDBB/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o03_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1)), and [rectifier](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07DK3ZZB4/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o09_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1). The headlight on these old Hondas is unique, so you'll need to also replace the headlight housing unless you feel like doing modifications. I went with a cheap Chinese one (might want to wait until we know more about the coronavirus...).

When stock parts inevitably go bad, I'd check out [https://www.davidsilverspares.com/](https://www.davidsilverspares.com/), [https://www.partzilla.com/](https://www.partzilla.com/), and then eBay. 

On a bike with front discs, I recommend cracking open the brake and checking the gasket. Mine was dried out and allowed water in, which rusted the little ratcheting spring assembly, which was a bitch.

Also, I'd pull out the old airbox and add a little aftermarket pod air filter. People will rag on me for this, but, you know, just adjust your carb.

Other things that go wrong: if it's been sitting dry, you'll probably need to replace seals in the petcock and in the carb. If your carb is leaking, it VERY PROBABLY DOES NOT NEED A FLOAT ADJUSTMENT. DO NOT DO THAT FIRST. It's very likely just the gaskets.

I think I just saved you about $300 in incorrect parts and shipping.

Good luck!"

Signs that the spread of the coronavirus is slowing down
ANALYSIS | Published Feb 10, 2020 11:55 (+00:00)
Despite some negative headlines over the weekend, there have been more signs in recent days that the spread of the coronavirus is slowing down.

When it comes to the number of deaths, it is now above 800, which exceeds the level from SARS in 2003. The death count should slow down with a lag compared to the number of infections.

China is restarting production today following an extended holiday. It could lead to a pick-up in the contagion rate and hence uncertainty will be with us for a while.

We continue to look for a V-shape scenario for Chinese growth with a sharp decline in February and March but a rebound during Q2, see also Research: Vshape scenario for global growth on back of coronavirus, 3 February 2020.

 

A run-down of the latest data
Infections. The number of infections has increased to 40,536. However, the daily rate of increase has slowed down. The absolute rise in cases was 2,500-3,000 in the past two days, down from 3,500-4,000 five days ago. The number of suspected cases showed the first decline today when it dropped to 23,589 from 28,942 yesterday.

Death rate. The number of deaths rose to 910 today. Of the deaths 96% were in the Hubei province. The total death rate is 2.2% with 2.9% inside the Hubei province and 0.4% outside. Outside mainland China, the death count is still two, leading to a death rate of 0.5%.

>A **vaccine** is a biological preparation that provides active [acquired immunity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acquired_immunity) to a particular [disease](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease).  A vaccine typically contains an agent that resembles a disease-causing  microorganism and is often made from weakened or killed forms of the  microbe, its toxins, or one of its surface proteins. The agent  stimulates the body's [immune system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immune_system)  to recognize the agent as a threat, destroy it, and to further  recognize and destroy any of the microorganisms associated with that  agent that it may encounter in the future. Vaccines can be [prophylactic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prophylaxis) (to prevent or ameliorate the effects of a future [infection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection) by a natural or ""wild"" [pathogen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogen) 

So a vaccine is an after the fact protection against future outbreaks of the same virus.

There is a cure its called the bodies immune system, the doctor on the frontline wrote about the treatments they use, basically keeping people a live buy keeping the body functioning long enough for immunity to kick in. Look I could repeat what he wrote.

Key diagnostic test might be missing many coronavirus cases
------------------------------------------------
China's ability to control a rapidly spreading coronavirus epidemic is under further strain amid fears that a key test used to confirm new cases is failing to catch large numbers of people with the disease. Problems with so-called nucleic acid tests (NATs) widely used to identify the presence of the previously unknown pneumonia-causing virus make it likely that many infections are going uncounted even as the number of confirmed cases continues to spiral.

Authorities are still struggling to ascertain the true extent of the epidemic, which had infected (link in Chinese) 34 598 people and killed 723 in China as of Friday [7 Feb 2020], according to the National Health Commission (NHC). In Hubei, the province at the epicenter of the outbreak, reports of overwhelmed hospitals, scarce medical supplies, and overly stringent diagnostic criteria have complicated efforts to determine the scope of the disease.

Health officials have recommended cheap, abundant, and generally accurate NATs as one of 2 main methods to confirm the presence of the coronavirus in humans. The technique involves collecting samples from patients and testing them for specific kinds of molecules that appear in the genetic material of the new coronavirus. If those molecules are present in the sample, the patient is isolated for treatment. But there is growing concern that those NATs are producing large numbers of false negatives. In a Wednesday [5 Feb 2020] interview with state broadcaster CCTV, Wang Chen, an expert in critical diseases and director of the Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, said one characteristic of the virus was that ""not all of those infected by it return positive NATs.""

""Even patients who definitely have the disease only come back positive 30%-50% of the time,"" Wang said. ""Testing throat swabs (from potentially infected people) also returns a lot of false negatives.""

Tests like NATs are especially important in people that may have contracted the virus but have not yet shown symptoms. Emerging trends in local infections mean that many such patients may have been sent home by hospitals after their NATs came back negative, doctors told Caixin. ""At the moment, more and more cases in Wuhan are flaring up collectively in family groups, and the majority are of the concealed onset type,"" said Zhang Xiaochun, a deputy director of the medical imaging department at Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University, one of the institutions at the center of the outbreak. ""They may have undergone one or even several NATs and shown no clinical symptoms, but keeping them under observation at home is bound to spread the disease further."" A doctor in the imaging department of another major Wuhan hospital, who spoke on condition of anonymity, told Caixin said that previously some patients whose CT scans clearly showed signs of viral infection but whose NATs tested negative were ""released"" back into their communities due to a shortage of hospital berths.

NATs are by nature an imperfect mechanism for determining the presence of a given organism. For instance, because the genetic material they test for usually only exists in tiny amounts, many NATs include a step called amplification, which makes many copies of it. A shortcoming of amplification is that it also copies any contaminating DNA in the sample, potentially causing misleading results. ""All experienced doctors know that NATs contain flaws,"" the doctor told Caixin. Aside from NATs, health officials have also recommended the use of gene sequencing to confirm coronavirus infections.

But that method has its own problems. Although gene sequencing is comparatively accurate, it is also expensive, and not all affected hospitals have the necessary facilities. Additionally, at the start of the outbreak, many hospitals had to gain permission from higher authorities to conduct such tests, a rule that has since been relaxed. Experts have previously called for the inclusion of CT scanning as a key basis for diagnosing coronavirus infections, as well as rapid hospital admission and isolation.

In response to calls from medical professionals on the frontlines of the epidemic, the NHC on Tuesday [4 Feb 2020] relaxed the clinical criteria for reporting suspected coronavirus cases, with extra leeway granted to people in Hubei. Outside the stricken province, medical professionals should now suspect coronavirus infection in patients with radiographic evidence of pneumonia, fever, and/or breathing problems, and a low-to-normal white blood cell count or a low lymphocyte count. Within Hubei, only 2 of the 3 criteria are required.

China added more than 3000 new coronavirus cases each day from Monday through Friday [3 Feb through 7 Feb 2020], with the vast majority occurring in Hubei, according to NHC figures."

That is the whole thing that doesn't make sense. If this was conspiracy theory. It makes more sense the American government did to overshadow the impeachment hearings and all the fuckery coming in to the elections. Released at a time in which most Chinese people are traveling and gathering, to have most impact. And with the USA taking greater issue with China lately. And as America loses global trust due to Trump, and China emerging more of a super power, it would be a way to regain global importance.

I don't think it is a conspiracy, but if it was, it makes more sense that the Americans released it."

Virus symptoms 'can take nearly a month to show'
Reports in China suggest the virus' incubation period might actually be 24 days - 10 days longer than previously thought.

Research by leading expert Zhong Nanshan in China suggests symptoms show on average after three days, but can take as long as 24 days."

>January 20-23: British Patient X travels to Singapore, where there are no confirmed cases of coronavirus (source, source)

>January 24-28: British Patient X stays in a French chalet, then returns to the UK (source)

>February 4: First confirmed local transmission in Singapore (source)

>February 6: British Patient X is diagnosed with coronavirus (source)

>February 8: Five people who stayed in the same French chalet as British Patient X are diagnosed with coronavirus (source)

The Chinese only quarantined Wuhan on the 23rd Jan, when Singapore found a confirmed patient - I think they thought ""holy shit, if it's in Singapore, it's all over China"". This was too late because people from Wuhan were at that conference in Singapore on 20th Jan, that the UK superspreader was at. And that conference also spread the disease to other Singaporeans and Malaysians."

2020-02-10,vaccinepapers,China_Flu,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/China_Flu/comments/f1qbns/what_are_the_recommendations_to_strengthen_immune/fh8sjr6/,"Vitamin A is one of the most important for respiratory infection. Take a single dose of  400,000iu at the first sign of infection. This is far too much to take daily. But when an infection is starting, this large dose is needed. 

The vitamin A accelerates immune activation and antibody production. This gives the immune shstem a head start in fighting the infection. It can even abort the illness. Large dose of vitaminA can indjce a fever, which is a sign that it is working.

 Vitamin A is particularly important for IgA production. IgA is the immunoglobulin used in mucosal tissues like the respiratory tract and gut.,

Vitamin A is stored in the liver. When an infecfion starts, the liver releases the vitamin A into the blood, where it is taken up by immune cells and used to make antibodies and IgA.however, the liver has a limkted amount of vit A, and once it is released, the liver does not get it back. It is used up and lost in the urine. So the liver is hesitant to release it. This slows down the immune response.

In severe infection like sepsis, vitamin A lost in the urine can increase 1000-fold!

When the liver runs out of vitamin A, the immune system cannot function and death is likely. 

I think vitamin A depletion might be why people are dying of coronavirus after a couple weeks. Coronavirus patients are not being given vitamin A, which is idiotic."

We've  been trying to get China to  back down in the trade war for a long time  now, but so far we've been  unsuccessful. It's a game of brinkmanship,  and we can't hold on any  longer because the US economy is about to  crash.

We released the virus  because the US must not lose the trade war.  Trump will absolutely  never, ever be humiliated by conceding defeat and repealing his tariffs on China, and have China tell us what the trade terms will be.  Nor can we allow it to  be announced to the world that we lost the trade war by our economy  crashing harder  than the Great Recession. So we sabotaged them by  another means.

Our economy is  about to crash because  we've been artificially propping it up to create  the illusion that the  trade war isn't hurting us. The US appears  prosperous with low  unemployment, the stock market at record highs, and  going 10 years  without a recession. But it's an illusion that we're  presenting to China  to bluff them into thinking that the trade war  isn't hurting us.

The  truth is  that we've been engaged in massive government spending, and  the fed has  started up quantitative easing again to stimulate the  economy. It's  why our 2019 budget deficit is at $1 trillion, which  hasn't been that  high since 2012 when we were in the Great Recession and  using  quantitative easing to lift us out of it. It's also why we've  gone for a  record 10 years without a recession -- we postponed  it by sheer  spending. As a result, we've created a dangerous bubble that  is about  to burst.

Our seemingly prosperous economy is fake.

We  tried to bluff China, because Trump likes to bluff.  They called our bluff.   Meanwhile, Trump's bubble is about to burst. So we Tonya Harding-ed  them with the coronavirus to wreck them first."

Its much hardier than common bugs - shedding fresh light on its rapid spread, say German scientists.

To put this in context flu viruses can survive on hard surfaces and infect another person for 24 to 48 hours.
The length of time cold viruses can live outside the body is even shorter - usually only a few hours.

The coronavirus 2019-nCov, dubbed the Wuhan virus, has already claimed at least 910 lives - more than the 774 Sars outbreak in 2003.

Both originated in China and virologists say they are genetically close. There is no specific therapy.

Co-author Prof Eike Steinmann, head of the Department for Molecular and Medical Virology at Ruhr-University Bochum, said: ""Under the circumstances, the best approach was to publish these verified scientific facts in advance, in order to make all information available at a glance.""Tests showed disinfectants and bleaches containing ethanol, hydrogen peroxide or sodium hypochlorite are most effective.

The latter is the main active ingredient in Domestos.
Applied in appropriate concentrations they virtually completely destroy the pathogenic particles.
Prof Kampf said: ""As a rule, this is sufficient to significantly reduce the risk of infection.""
The experts assume the results from the analyses of other coronaviruses are transferable to the latest virus.
Different coronaviruses were analysed and the results were all similar."

People with mild or no apparent symptoms aren’t currently being counted among cases, he told reporters Sunday.

I know that many of you found my M9 sensor guide pretty useful (it also got pinned yeeeee)

So, i wanted to share another short guide.

I will start with the boring introduction, if you wanna skip it just start reading from the point where you see the three asterisks (\*\*\*)

I bought my Leica M9 with 2 batteries. But, apparently, the old owner ""forgot"" to tell me that the 2nd battery had actually been repaired with glue. Which, by itself it fine, if not for the fact that, once i pushed it in the slot, I was not able to remove it anymore.

So, after I extracted the battery, I tried to repair it unsuccessfully. So, I needed a solution. I loved the idea to charge it on the go, I go to camping often and electricity is not always a thing. So i was considering the Nitecore charger.

I really suggest it to you if you don't mind about spending 60 bucks I read really good reviews about it. Though, I hated the idea of spending another 60 euros on something for my Leica that is not a Lens or maintenance.

So given my experience with connected devices I thought about building a step down and inserting it in the ""Car charger"" plug on the original battery charger.

BUT HEY! Someone already thought about it for me, and it was on sale on Aliexpress.

Just search for this below  on Aliexpress or Amazon(I cannot post the link because Reddit moderates it)

There are other models that look like usb flash drives though, my idea was to leave it in a backpack and, having something so long, might have had bending issues.

So, I bought it and, of course, it did not work. I tried with 2 power banks and with different wall chargers but nothing. I left it in a drawer and forgot it for a long time.

However, yesterday I woke up with an illumination. What about trying with a lower amperage power bank? It should not work I've already tried with lower amperage wall plug.

And EUREKA! it worked

Precisely the powerbank is a Huawei gadget that I received in a presentation from them. The output port I use are a 2.1A port (5V of course) and also the 1A works!(which is physically speaking weird but whatever). Actually I noticed that with laptops it works as well.

I believe that the dispersion of this setup is quite high. I think that a 5000 Mah power bank does not charge about 3 times a 1700 Mah leica battery as it should, but it would be closer to 1.5/2 times. Also the charging speed might not be as fast as charging it from the wall plug.

So, this solution is not as good as a Nitecore, sometimes it is also inconsistent when plugged to a power source and then switched to another. The laptop seem to work always without any issue, while the powerbank usually works from both of the ports but, sometimes, it works only from one. I do not know if it is my model of step up that is not working really well or if it is a normal thing. In the case you test it as well with other power banks or step-downs let me know!

I believe that to reduce the risk of not working you should try an old, or a cheap, power bank. Those ones did not have any weird electronics to charge your phone faster so they should give a constant energy stream.

I do suggest you to give it a try. finally 3 euros with shipping included i believe it is worth it!

Let me know also if you try it with a battery charger different than the M9 and M8 one!

Disclaimer:

The Coronavirus is slowing down all the deliveries from China so I would suggest to order it from amazon.

I did not test it with a leica m240 or a m10 or other digital leica batteries. It should work the same but you never know.

This set up should not have any risk because in every device involved there are safety chips. I will personally use it most of the times now on and I do not worry about it.

However, you assume the responsibilities of your actions, always use it under your supervision and test it the first time in a safe place.

2020-02-10,Synovexh001,exmuslim,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/exmuslim/comments/ex46mg/but_what_about_christianity/fh8w2hk/,"Hay!  Sorry, I'm not on here often.  Thanks for catching that, of course I meant to say the USSR was NOT religious, and I'm glad you got the nuance of how they managed to become a religion nonetheless.  Nazi/commie discussion notwithstanding.

Sorry for totally misreading you!  I think it's important to remember the importance of 'choice' in it, Muslims who spend their entire life in a country where freedom of religion is the highest, sacrosanct right of every human, really can't speak to the reality of a religion that has a stated end-goal of complete political and social control.  In the end, when we compare a progressive-liberal open-minded progressive Muslim to a Muslim living in a culture where FGM and consanguinous marriage are not only allowed but enforced, which of them count as 'really' islam?  The one that makes it palatable to western audiences, or the one that literally does exactly what the Prophet salaalahualeihiwasalaam tell them to do, under penalty of death?

(to be sure, Christ spoke occasionally about Hell, He mentioned 'eternal punishment' and a 'blazing furnace with weeping and gnashing of teeth,' but yeah you get the point)

I agree it's tragic that whatever good could come from religion always sags under the weight of people who just live their lives fearing punishment and seeking reward.  Ya end up with a bunch of psychopaths on very, very short leashes.  I detest it among Christianity but I can't blame anyone, it's simply human nature to seek power and it's too easy to wield with a little study.

>MUH CRUSADES

Okay I understand why you'd have that conclusion given the widespread image in modern culture of 'oppressive Christians coming to impose their culture,' but keep in mind none of them seem keen on mentioning the centuries leading up to them, when Islamic armies had repeatedly invaded Christian territory and carried off Christian slaves, and Islamic pirates had plundered every non-muslim vessel in every sea causing (AfI) hundreds of billions of dollars in economic losses.  Christian Europe had been some shade of peace and stability after the fall of Rome, but more than 2/3rds of the Christian world fall to Islamic conquest by the time the FIRST Crusade is declared, and made-for-TV-movies play it off like Islam is an innocent victim?  Bismillah

I agree wholeheartedly with the sentiment on living a religious, good life.  My problem is with religions that have a lot of early verses about being peaceful and tolerant, and many, many more later verses about conquest thru violence, and explicit instructions that the later verses take precedent over the older ones, and millions of people carrying this virus around, living peacefully as minorities using the shallow 'look how peaceful we are' verses when it's halal (through at any of innumerable hazily-defined conditions) to swap to verses about deceit and violence, of which there are many.  This is an ideology that was designed as a weapon, and it has killed more people than the coronavirus ever will.

It's always nice to be able to have a genuine, intelligent conversation.  Thanks for your patience!"
