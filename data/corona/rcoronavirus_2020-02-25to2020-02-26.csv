I would not want to be a US health care worker or patient in an American hospital right now, those places must be breeding grounds but they can't even take preventive measures without working test kits. So much for vaunted US technical prowess (I say this as American-born myself even though now working in UK). And then on top, at least if my gigs working in the USA are any indication, Americans will spread the COVID19 like wildfire, much worse than China or Europe since you can get fired for taking a single sick day off work in the US or even suggesting work at home. And then you lose your health care, and are too afraid to even go to a clinic for dread of the medical bills. I fear the United States will soon be the global epicentre for COVID-19 because of this perfect storm of dumpster fire policy. As bad as things were in China, the Chinese can take aggressive centralised action and you don't go broke from medical bills there or get fired for taking a day off, which helps more than anything to contain the viral spread.

A few week's ago it was all panic, now they all seem much more relaxed. The hospitals are not as full, no one is panic buying, people are beginning to filter onto streets. China stocks are recovering.

Perhaps thee is more than 5 cases outside Hubei, but the people there are certainly behaving now more like Singapore - satisfied was governmental measures.

If anything CCP has gained support on this fiasco; and a lot of my friend there who a typically very critical of CCP are grudgingly admitting that they're glad they're in China right now - and not in Korea/USA. They believe there is already widespread community transmission and that it'll blow up like Korea. Meanwhile with Korea, there's being talk that they should have better controlled their cults.

Lets face it, draconian quarantine measures work. If you lock everyone in houses for 21 days - local transmissions are going to take a diver.

Money is only used to exchange a consumable good, in this case travel experience. As long as you have not traveled, you are still in possession of the consumable good. Your decision is now between calculating the probability of getting sick, and compare it with the value of the experience. Ill give u an example. Suppose you consider the probability of getting sick is 0.1 and its disutility is 10. The travel experience, since it will happen with probability is 1, suppose it has utility of 2.

These four patients are Americans who were evacuated from the Diamond Princess cruise ship in Japan and brought to Travis Air Force Base in Solano County for a 14-day period of quarantine. On Monday afternoon, CDC officials said test results came back positive for four of the evacuees staying at Travis. Hours later, they were taken to hospitals in Napa, Sonoma and Contra Costa counties.

That brings the total number of Diamond Princess passengers evacuated to Travis Air Force Base who then tested positive for the coronavirus, officially named COVID-19, to 19. 

Of those 19, 15 patients — including the four newest cases — are in Northern California hospitals, spread over several counties. The remaining four were taken to medical facilities in the Spokane, Wash.

CDC spokesperson Scott Pauley said patients are going to hospitals across several counties ""to make sure the burden doesn’t overwhelm Solano County’s"" health services and system. This also isn't impacting the number of beds for regular hospital patients.

""COVID-19 patients require specialized isolation rooms where the average hospital patient would not stay,"" Pauley said. 

He also explained by spreading the patients across multiple counties, the CDC isn't expanding the risk of exposure because every hospital, ""has CDC protocols in place."" 

""Nobody in the community or hospitals are at heightened risk,"" Pauley added.

The CDC expects more test results soon from those who were evacuated to Travis AFB"

-----

If you get quarantined the only thing hand sanitizer will do for you is get you real drunk after your supplies have run out. Preserving access to public utilities will be a primary objective for governments, water isn't a bad prep but it's not essential unless we expect a cataclysmic collapse. Far more likely are intermittent ower outages should the workforce become ill and unable to repair downed power lines.

Supply chain disruptions are already happening and it's prudent to expect them to worsen.

The average suburban or urban area has ~3 days of food available in groceries for the people they serve. Surge capacity for major resupply is difficult and becomes increasingly complicated with multiple geographic areas affected. Don't wait until the Panic-demic.

1. MultiVitamins. They're cheap and in the event you're subsisting on rice for prolonged periods will prevent nutrient deficiencies.


2. Shelf stable calorie dense food with complete proteins.  
-Proteins are built from amino acids and there are nine our bodies can't build that need to be provided by our diet. Rice & beans is a common example of two foods combined that provide all nine. Meat always contains complete proteins.  
-Fat is calorie dense providing 9 calories/gram whereas carbs and proteins contain 4 calories/gram. What does this practically mean? Buy tuna packed in oil. Buy oil to splash on your rice and beans.  
-Spam. Seriously, spam. It fed the allied forces throughout WWII, is calorie dense, provides adequate salt and complete protein, is fully cooked, shelf stable, and has enough calories in a single can (1080) to provide adequate although not optimal caloric intake for a day in the event of a prolonged supply chain disruption. It also cost somewhere around $2.50/can.  
-Buy a canister of *iodinated* salt and a bag of sugar.  
-Your pets need to eat, too. Don't forget Fido.


3. Go to the dentist. If you've been putting it off for whatever reason make an appointment today. Dental infections and pain are a real bummer and if your dentist is dead or closes up shop I suppose you can always resort to a pair of pliers. 


4. Primarily buy things you use on a daily basis. This includes soap, shampoo, toothpaste and toothbrushes, deodorant, laundry soap, mouthwash, razors. (Yes, razors. A shave puts a shine on the day, it's good for morale.) Worst case scenario, if this all blows over you won't have to go shopping for awhile.


5. Toilet Paper & Sanitary Napkins. Unless you're going to magically stop pooping or menstruating in the next three months you'll use your surplus. 


6. OTC meds. Don't go crazy. Buy what you use. If you have GERD and take omeprazole everyday then go buy the million count container. Otherwise just get the basics in case you or your family become ill.  
-Tylenol. Fevers are our friends in fighting infection but if they runaway into dangerous territory this is a good treatment.   
-Guaifenesin--optionally including a cough suppressant, you've gotta sleep sometime, right?--to loosen secretions so you can cough the evil out.   
-Loperamide and a recipe for Oral Rehydrating Solution (ORS) handy in the event you get the trots.
-Diphenhydramine for allergic reactions and as a sleep aid.  
-Antifungal powder or cream. In the event of water rationing you're gonna get a little funk. Jock itch, athlete's foot, or yeast under your breasts is not only a bummer but compromises skin integrity and increases the risk of infection. 

7. Get your house in order. Been putting off a pile of laundry? Can't rely on being able to go to the laundromat, take care of it sometime soon.


8. Get your head in order.  
-If you pray, reinvigorate your prayer life. If you're into meditation or contemplation, start practicing that again. Detachment is important.  
-Pick a spiritual or philosophical book that you can read a little from every day when you wake up. If religion/spirituality isn't your thing then the stoics are always good. You can start with five minutes each of prayer/meditation and reading per day. Build up to 15-30 minutes of each by adding a couple minutes every few days.  
-Buy a yoga mat. Being quarantined inside is challenging for your body-mind. Find a yoga, pilates, or bodyweight exercise routine to keep active.


9. You can't prepare for every possibility. Take basic precautions and learn to love the bug."

In the U.S., patients are frequently uninsured or underinsured.

This means that when they have a fever and cough, their first stop will be their local pharmacy.

They will infect pharmacy staff.

Pharmacy staff will work sick, because absenteeism is strongly discouraged.

The pharmacy staff will infect their patients, in person and through all the many prescriptions they fill.

This is going to be horrific, but it is not being planned for. Go look at your local pharmacies: are they wearing PPE?"

According to Bruce Aylward, China has a 5 point system that they applied throughout their health system when the outbreak was declared, based on some key concepts of quarantine, containment, contact tracing, and social distancing:

1. Lateral organisation - every part of the system, from the national to state to the district and local, was reformed and organised to fight the coronavirus. New guidelines and manuals are published every single week in how to best to tackle the virus, and individuals on the ground are adapting it to their local situations.

2. Multi-institutional “war” footing - the state reacted as if in a war, and mobilised their entire bureaucracy to dealing with the virus. Different ministries that had different expertises or different access to goods or materials were included to best utilise resources and simplify delivering on targets and goals. Hospitals are put up in weeks, beds and equipment rolled out all over, masks being made, etc.

3. Radical technology - China has been utilising the latest in technological innovations, such as complex AI that does statistical modelling and analysis. The entire country is online, which has enabled them to isolate millions of people yet still provide them with services and information. Massive logistical undertaking utilising the ubiquitousness of smartphones and 4g/5g. As a result, they and healthcare workers get almost live updates and information, as well as advanced data modelling and being able to fully understand the virus and how it operates. Instead of seeing it as “SARS” or as “Flu”, China is seeing it for what it is: a novel, never seen before, unknown coronavirus. China has also been at the forefront of utilising big data on contact tracing.

4. National unity - Chinese citizens have willfully complied with quarantine and lockdowns. Everyone is “in” on preventing this virus spreading and acting together as a society. This quarantine is unprecedented in world history and speaks to the discipline and mentality of the Chinese that they all willingly stayed home to defeat the virus. Social distancing is also keenly applied which people are following, where you keep 2 meters apart at all times. Aylward worries that social unrest and the public not following along with the government is more likely in other countries than in China, where the key to success was a compliant citizenry who accepted the situation. 

5. Adaptability/Flexibility - While there are central guidelines updated weekly, and a structure and organisation from the top-down, what struck Aylward repeatedly was how everything is flexible enough to be adapted on the local level to local needs. Instead of exhausting the medical system by having the same response throughout the country, each district was essentially tailored to utilise parts of the guidelines that were needed for their own situation. This was found throughout, a high degree of flexibility so not everything followed a rigid system. The basics and fundamentals were all there throughout the different healthcare systems that were looked at, but highly tailored.

Hope this summary helps."

1.  Seal off 1/3 of the house for her to live in, in quarantine.  I purchased 6 mil clear plastic for this.  She'll have access to two bedrooms and a bathroom.  

2.  We will also seal off ducting and her windows will remain open at all times.

Top health officials back off CDC messaging that coronavirus spread in U.S. is inevitable

In an afternoon news conference, Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar and other top health officials backed off the CDC’s strong warning earlier Tuesday that the spread of the coronavirus in the United States was inevitable.

The briefing was scheduled on short notice, and the markedly different tone came after the Dow fell more than 800 points in the wake of the CDC’s warning.

Instead, Azar, a top CDC official who was not on the CDC call earlier Tuesday and other leading public health officials said the United States wanted to have a large-scale response prepared “just in case” there was person-to-person spread.

“We believe the immediate risk here in the United States remains low, and we’re working hard to keep that risk low,” said Anne Schuchat, the CDC’s principal deputy director.

Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said during the news conference that the government was about a month and a half away from beginning early clinical safety tests for a coronavirus vaccine, adding that it would take a year to a year and a half before the vaccine was widely available."

“You’ll be so lonely,” says Nicole Gadon, 68, who was required to stay inside her house after testing positive for tuberculosis in 2014. If you come down with (or are exposed to) certain communicable diseases, including cholera, diphtheria, infectious tuberculosis, plague, smallpox, yellow fever, viral hemorrhagic fever, SARS or a pandemic influenza, the state and federal governments can force you into quarantine and isolation. Often you will be told to hole up in your house or apartment until you are no longer deemed a threat.

If you live with others, you will most likely be told to sleep in separate rooms and avoid physical contact. Cohabitants should be tested regularly. Gadon’s husband at the time stayed with her during her six months in isolation. Each day they briefly overlapped in the kitchen but were otherwise apart. Sometimes the desire for human contact will overwhelm you. One night, early on, when she was gravely ill and felt she might die, Gadon went up to her husband’s bedroom and asked to lie next to him. He declined to let her sleep there for the night. “I really just wanted to be hugged,” she says. Gadon slept next to her cat, Izzy. “Get an indoor pet,” she says.

Every day, a nurse came to take Gadon’s vitals, watch her take medication and collect coughed-up phlegm (Gadon needed three consecutive clean tests to go free). Cover your mouth when you cough. Wash your hands often. Noninfected people near you should wear an air-purifying respirator like an N95 mask, and you should wear a surgical mask. Keep windows open for ventilation. If you need to call the police, firefighters or paramedics, warn them about your condition.

Quarantine will strain relationships. “It definitely puts stress on a marriage,” says Gadon, who was divorced not long after her diagnosis. Don’t be ashamed. Find others who have survived your disease and connect with them online. Gadon wishes she had said yes when her brother offered to fly across the country to stand 15 feet away on her lawn and keep her company. She wishes she had found a way to see her grown son. If she had to do it again, Gadon says she would let people support her. “Ask for help,” she says."

Like keeping staff off the roads.  Close roads.  

Example:  in Florida when a state of emergency is declared due to an impending hurricane, the government then has the ability to take a highway, and declare the lanes that usually flow towards the coast - now are reversed, and the entire highway or Interstate, all lanes, is now basically one way - heading away from the coast as folks evacuate inland."

In that same sentence you’re also saying that they should be prepared for any eventuality, which is something that can only happen when there’s an excess of funding.
