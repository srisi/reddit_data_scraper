> An unidentified form of viral pneumonia has struck several dozen people in the Chinese city of Wuhan, sparking concerns that the country may be facing an outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome.

> The outbreak began in China, where 349 people died from the disease on the mainland and 299 more perished in Hong Kong, according to Asian news channel CNA. The SARS virus spreads through person-to-person contact and can be expelled from an infected individual when they cough or sneeze, contaminating both people and nearby objects.

> The cause of the infections remains unknown, but the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission has ruled out &quot;Influenza, avian influenza, adenovirus infection and other common respiratory diseases&quot; as potential culprits, according to TK. &quot;At this point, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus is not yet confirmed or excluded as the cause of the outbreak,&quot; said Gauden Galea, WHO&#039;s representative in China, AFP reported.

Now that you’ve mentioned, I’ll double-check if coronavirus was indeed tested.

Vet prescribed a week’s meds for the campy infection and I was hoping as that cleared up it would help with her appetite, but we are half a week in and no luck. I’ll definitely ask for an appetite stimulant when we go back next week. Thank you."

Granted, a positive coronavirus doesn’t necessarily confirm FIP, but a negative result most definitely rules it out.

The campylobacter infection could be dragging your cat down. Your vet can give your cat a shot of an appetite stimulant if it gets worrisome."
