[In 2018, Amazon spent $14.2 million on lobbying.](https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2019-amazon-lobbying/) They hired Jay Carney, President Barack Obama’s press secretary, to oversee those efforts. Most of this money is [spent on lobbying for tax changes](https://www.politico.com/tipsheets/politico-influence/2017/07/25/how-amazon-is-actually-lobbying-on-taxes-221519). In 2017, three of their lobbyists were former members of Congress.

They are almost certainly getting a huge return on that money. There are no real studies on the rate of return of lobbying, but [the few that do exist](http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1375082) imply that Amazon made much more than these $100M on that lobbying effort alone. Then there's the legion of tax accountants, lawyers, and other bureaucrats dedicated to keeping their money out of the government's hands. They are literally making billions off of changing the tax system.

In 2018, they paid [zero dollars in federal taxes](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/02/04/amazon-had-to-pay-federal-income-taxes-for-the-first-time-since-2016.html). Actually zero. They even got a $129 million tax rebate.

Meanwhile, Jeff Bezos is the richest man alive, even after he lost $38 billion -- that's $38 000 million -- in a divorce settlement. Now he's giving $100 million to food banks, great.

And let's not forget that Amazon uses our publicly funded roads and infrastructure system more than almost any other company. This isn't a tech giant that works from home, they are using our public resources every day. And they are not paying anything back.
 
Please do not laud Bezos' ""charitable"" contributions until he starts paying taxes. He is paying for goodwill after exploiting the tax code and our broken political system to get away with billions of dollars in unpaid taxes that should go to our hospitals, to our schools, and to those who shouldn't have to go to a food bank in the first place.

I wrote some more about lobbying on here [a few years ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/4go6by/half_of_americans_think_presidential_nominating/d2jci9f/). In short, you _have_ to take lobbying into account when talking about big companies' actions. It is how they avoid giving back after taking as much as they can. It is how they seem ""nice"" when they're screwing you over. Don't fall for it."

Symptoms, similar to a cold or flu, may take up to 14 days to appear after exposure to COVID-19. Current studies are investigating if the virus can be transmitted to others if someone is not showing symptoms.

Right.  And that's where the science is right now.  There is reason to think that asymptomatic people are shedding virus, but it's not certain how large a factor that is or how commonly (or easily) it is transmitted by that route.  So they put it that way until the data is clearer.

To claim that the government is stating that asymptomatic people can not infect others, as you did in your title, is simply false, and has no place in this subreddit."

People with direct deposit on file are going to see their checks on or around the 13th, and then waves of about 5 million physical checks per week from there. That's actually quite an operation to undergo with so little lead time and planning.  They're processing far more checks all at once than they would during tax season because people don't all file at the same time, and even then the refunds are staggered.

The article also notes that for paper checks, they're starting with the lowest earners based on reported AGI first, and then working up the scale, which I think is a great move.

It still sucks for people that need to wait, but I think they're doing what they can given the circumstances, and hopefully their prioritization plan means the people waiting the longest are generally those who will be hurting less, relatively speaking."

He had warned the Pentagon that the outbreak aboard his ship was “accelerating” because crew members were living in confined spaces.

""We are not at war. Sailors do not need to die,"" stated the four-page letter, dated 30 March.

Capt Crozier had called for ""decisive action"", saying uninfected sailors had to be removed from the ship and isolated.

The letter was later published by the San Francisco Chronicle.

## What has the reaction been?

In a statement, [**Democratic leaders of the House Armed Services Committee said:**](https://armedservices.house.gov/press-releases?ID=2EFC2A13-1968-4190-8215-F9E2FCCB133D) ""While Captain Crozier clearly went outside the chain of command, his dismissal at this critical moment... is a destabilising move that will likely put our service members at greater risk and jeopardise our fleet's readiness.""

There are some vents with gimicky modes that try to be adaptive in terms of very, very basic targeting methods. These modes are absolutely not to be used in patients this critically ill (IMHO).

The reason being is patient blood work values dictate the changes needed on a ventilator, as well as physical assessment of lung aeration, patient-ventilator interaction with management of sedatives, reviews of chest x-ray findings will also dictate the changes needed to be made to a ventilator, hemodynamics, all of which are constantly changing on a minute-to-minute basis in a critically ill human. The general public is simplifying ""ventilator"" far too much to properly take care of these critically ill ARDS covid patients. The newly designed disaster ventilators that are popping up should only be used in the very last ditch effort.

The other end of the spectrum are bipaps and cpap's which have an auto feature for use in sleep apneas, totally non-critical use and aimed towards patient comfort and ultimately compliance in it's use in order to better sleep at night, these are not ventilators. Edit- there are critically ill patients that we use ventilator-tier bipap and cpap therapy for but not the auto ones.

[“Fauci has become a public target for some right-wing commentators and bloggers, who exercise influence over parts of the president’s base. As they press for the president to ease restrictions to reinvigorate economic activity, some of these figures have assailed Fauci and questioned his expertise. Last month, an article depicting him as an agent of the “deep state” gained nearly 25,000 interactions on Facebook — meaning likes, comments and shares — as it was posted to large pro-Trump groups with titles such as “Trump Strong” and “Tampa Bay Trump Club.”](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/anthony-faucis-security-is-stepped-up-as-doctor-and-face-of-us-coronavirus-response-receives-threats/2020/04/01/ff861a16-744d-11ea-85cb-8670579b863d_story.html)


They also mention crazed fans of Tony being an issue as well, but it’s very obvious that those who are anti-Fauci would be right-wing just based on the current partisanship of Covid-19 in America.

edit: Also that Fox article plainly points out that Trump supporters have been openly critical of Fauci multiple times, so I’m not sure why you think that it doesn’t support that theory."

I feel cheated. When this all started in New York, where I live, I was told masks would not protect, but in fact burden health care workers. I believed it, and as a good citizen, I followed the guidelines. Yesterday, on my weekly trip to the supermarket, I saw signs on the shelves asking patrons to wear masks. What??? Where am I supposed to find masks at this stage? 

To add to the insecurity, after every necessary outing, I come home anxious because I have a high risk at home, my partner. So, right after I came home yesterday, I started researching online where I could get masks in case I got sick. All I got is that masks don't protect you against covid 19. Well,  I went ahead, searched eBay, Amazon and some other private companies websites and found some masks, at a premium, which will arrive in 8 days (I hope!)

TODAY our governor and mayor announced we should be wearing masks to go out of the house. REALLY? NOW? ARE YOU ALL SERIOUS?

Why did the leaders of my city and state and all these TV doctors led us to believe the masks were not necessary? I don't get it. I am not an epidemiologist, but it sounds basic to my idiotic brain that if most of us were wearing masks from the beginning to slow down the spread from the bottom, wouldn't it have been less taxing on the healthcare system? Hindsight is 20/20, I should have followed my guts in February and gotten some masks, fuck the experts advice.

Sad is that every time I went out in the past month, I would see people wearing masks and I passed judgment - that those people were selfish. But now I wonder: am I the foolish one?

I really needed to vent."
