Your comment on going to the beach on spring break thing is multi-faceted. Firstly, younger people are literally biologically [not going to make the best decisions](https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=141164708), regardless of generation. That is where authority figures are supposed to step in, and the paltry government response and attempt to undermine the severity of this issue (who, get this, are *not* millenials/Gen Z!) in the beginning didn't help either.

Instead, Chinese officials punished doctors for trying to warn the public and suppressed information that might have saved lives. According to the Times of London, Chinese doctors who had identified the pathogen in early December received a gag order from China’s National Health Commission with instructions to stop tests, destroy samples and suppress the news.

Fortunately the American regime took swift action as soon as community spread was detected, didn't suppress information, didn't stop testing, and didn't lie to the American public about the outbreak. So at least the disease was swiftly contained once it reached American shores.

When one of the selected men, Franciszek Gajowniczek, cried out, ""My wife! My children!"", Kolbe volunteered to take his place.[8]

According to an eyewitness, who was an assistant janitor at that time, in his prison cell, Kolbe led the prisoners in prayer. Each time the guards checked on him, he was standing or kneeling in the middle of the cell and looking calmly at those who entered. After they had been starved and deprived of water for two weeks, only Kolbe remained alive. The guards wanted the bunker emptied, so they gave Kolbe a lethal injection of carbolic acid. Kolbe is said to have raised his left arm and calmly waited for the deadly injection.[11] He died on 14 August. His remains were cremated on 15 August, the feast day of the Assumption of Mary.[18]"

It was 1 trillion dollars to pump into the economy. A small portion of that was direct payments to taxpayers. This is the part Republicans really wanted to emphasize, the slight dose of sugar to get the poison down.

Dems opposed because 500 billion dollars of it is essentially a giveaway to distressed businesses at the discretion of the Treasury. They also dont have to disclose who gets the money for 6 months. Note that a distressed industry is hotels, and the president owns hotels...see the problem?

55 billion was basically a giveaway to airlines, but the major issue is that there was minimal expansion of health coverage or unemployment. Essentially, if you are a business, you could get a loan at zero interest,but if you were a worker you can go to hell.

Another issue was that not a dime of the bill went to hospitals or healthcare infrastructure. It's not designed to save lives or livelihoods. It is designed to nail out billionaire who really dont want to become millionaires in a recession.

People do not understand that.

The government is literally a gang that grew very large

Trace the history

The Roman Empire collapsed, and Europe was taken over by various warlords and their bands, i.e. ""gangs"".

Those warlords became kings, and established feudalism, which is really exactly the same thing as an organized crime structure. 

The stability of which is maintained through a combination of monopoly on violence and the fact that it would be worse without it. 

From then on things evolved into modern ""governments"", but the essence of the structure is the same. 

And it has been the same cycle everywhere else after serious societal collapse.

Conversely, if you look at how the mafia in Sicily evolved, it had a lot of social functions that the weak central government could not carry out, which is why it was supported by the population. 

Same thing in the favelas ."

I mean it’s a really strongly supported theory in sociology that unemployment, homelessness and other things that relinquishes you from Maslow’s first two steps of human needs - ie. physiological needs like food and water and safety needs like employment and shelter - always comes with crime.

Homelessness is not of course always created by a government that has given up, its cause can be a million different things, but a weak govt is one.

If the government does not provide you with your basic needs to survive, someone else will, since, duh there is always a market for your basic needs

This a transaction where one gets basic needs and the other gets power and control. What bigger control can you have over a person than providing them water, which is literally the most important thing for them to survive? Organised crime sees this opportunity and ceases it. They give people basic needs which will keep them complacent and in return they get control over areas.

tldr govt no rule good -> people cant get water;water very important -> someone else supplies water -> ganggang comes with water cause ganggang can get power if give people water because water very important"

ABSOLUTELY NOT.

Flattening the Curve is about slowing the rate that most of us get it. And if we slow it enough with social distancing measures (there's a 17 day delay between measures and effect on the curve), then our hospitals can keep up and the fatality rate stays under 1%. 

If the hospitals crash (as they are definitely going to in the US, because we haven't yet seen strong enough social distancing, plus the 17 day lag), then the fatality rate skyrockets.

Social distancing works. The virus cannot spread itself. It needs us to come in close contact with each other. If even 90% of the country gets serious about self-isolation, then we will clobber the curve to a point where it's manageable."

When this whole thing went down everyone that I know in the restaurant industry is hurting.  Employees, franchise owners, managers it is the darkest days for the industry Ive spent my life in.  No one is immune.

So what does this “greedy” company do.  They pay me full wage based on my first two weeks hours while I care for my children.  They reimburse me for money I spent on childcare while schools when schools closed. They also count those hours towards earning benefits just the same as if I were working.  Our store is still open as we try to find ways we can donate food and assist with the hospital near our store.  We are losing money every day we are open but have continued to give all partners the same number of hours they had before this all happened.

Bloodoxygen is fine too. On Saturday it dropped to 94% at worst and my pulse went to like 88-95. Now its back to 98% and 80 puls. 


My mother reports minor coughing and leck of smelling and tasting. Otherwise no symptoms. 

My dad is totally uneffected right now. 


My sister is coughing and feels pretty shit but nothing serious. No fever. 



Sure there is the chance none of us have it. Sadly we cant get tested as we never were in a danger area nor had contact with a confirmed case.

So last week I went to my local hardware store and bought myself a face shield. I’m posting on social media, along with other doctors and nurses on the front lines, using the hashtag #GetMePPE. It’s crazy to be a physician shopping in a hardware store for medical equipment.

Meanwhile, I’m losing sleep over the predicament of having no good course of action. Do I use masks with every patient to protect myself from asymptomatic spread and risk running out of masks entirely? When the PPE runs out, do I keep going in, like a firefighter charging into a burning building in a Speedo and flip-flops? The deaths of Italian doctors Robert Stella and Marcello Natali, who valiantly kept working without PPE, are a terrifying warning.

Will I come to a point where I have to make a decision about saving my family or saving my patients? I worry about my two teenage sons and my parents in their 70s. My family didn’t sign up to take this risk. In an attempt to protect them, I’ve set up a decontamination zone in my laundry room—when I come home after my shift, I go straight to the laundry room, strip and leave all work paraphernalia there before setting foot in the rest of the house and hugging my kids. Last night I cried as I made the decision that, if it comes to a shelter-in-place situation, my sons will stay with other family members, not with me. There is nothing harder for a mother.

Without more serious action to provide the armor we need on your front line—not just now, but for months, maybe years, as long as this virus is sweeping through an unimmunized population—this disease will be picking off health care workers one by one.

Please don’t let me be one of them."""

I know several vendors that buy up massive amounts of crap like TP, diapers, and some other common goods at liquidation sales or from wholesalers going out of business.  They make bank, I'm not gonna lie.  

For instance, they'll buy a crate or five of nearly-expired makeup, sell individual items for $1 each or ten for $5.  Diapers for $4 a pack.  So on and so forth.  Low overhead, high volume; well worth sitting in a field for four days straight.  Most of the time they'll have multiple truckloads of stuff and maybe leave with a third of what they brought with them to that show.

WHO is not only complicit in China's efforts to downplay the seriousness of this virus and to cover up its origins, they worked hand in hand with China to ensure the rest of the world was caught by surprise as infected travelers from China ([5 million from Wuhan city alone](https://www.scmp.com/news/china/society/article/3047720/chinese-premier-li-keqiang-head-coronavirus-crisis-team-outbreak)) spread the virus throughout China and then around the world.

On top of that WHO does China's dirty work in isolating Taiwan from the global medical community leaving 23.8 million people at risk.

We're all going to learn a lot of lessons from this crisis, and of course world leaders in places that were hit hard should be criticized for their mishandling of the response, but one thing that will not be forgotten is WHO's complicity and involvement in this virus' rapid spread. WHO already had an unflattering reputation coming out of the SARS response, I expect that this time the reaction from world leaders once this is all said and done will have some more serious ramifications on WHO's future viability and the effectiveness of the UN as a whole."
