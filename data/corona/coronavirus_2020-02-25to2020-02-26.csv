I would not want to be a US health care worker or patient in an American hospital right now, those places must be breeding grounds but they can't even take preventive measures without working test kits. So much for vaunted US technical prowess (I say this as American-born myself even though now working in UK). And then on top, at least if my gigs working in the USA are any indication, Americans will spread the COVID19 like wildfire, much worse than China or Europe since you can get fired for taking a single sick day off work in the US or even suggesting work at home. And then you lose your health care, and are too afraid to even go to a clinic for dread of the medical bills. I fear the United States will soon be the global epicentre for COVID-19 because of this perfect storm of dumpster fire policy. As bad as things were in China, the Chinese can take aggressive centralised action and you don't go broke from medical bills there or get fired for taking a day off, which helps more than anything to contain the viral spread.

Live in Italy, am near the red zone. Main takeaway is: there is a MASSIVE data reporting bias going on.

The virus has probably been around for weeks, but they only discovered it because some rando (so-called ""italian patient 1"") who has never been to china had extraordinarily bad symptoms and mentioned having lunch with a chinese guy, so they tested him for covid (the chinese lunch had nothing to do with the infection, it was later discovered).

After finding out about him they did tests in all villages in the regions and hundreds of cases came out, and old people deaths were attributed to the virus. THOSE BOOMERS WERE ALREADY DYING IN THE PRIOR WEEKS, but no one cared until they started testing.

So: your country is probably already infected, but no one is testing outside of airports, and most of non-boomers will not get anything beyond flu-like symptoms. Many boomers will die tho, and unless they test for covid it will only be a statistic."

These four patients are Americans who were evacuated from the Diamond Princess cruise ship in Japan and brought to Travis Air Force Base in Solano County for a 14-day period of quarantine. On Monday afternoon, CDC officials said test results came back positive for four of the evacuees staying at Travis. Hours later, they were taken to hospitals in Napa, Sonoma and Contra Costa counties.

That brings the total number of Diamond Princess passengers evacuated to Travis Air Force Base who then tested positive for the coronavirus, officially named COVID-19, to 19. 

Of those 19, 15 patients — including the four newest cases — are in Northern California hospitals, spread over several counties. The remaining four were taken to medical facilities in the Spokane, Wash.

CDC spokesperson Scott Pauley said patients are going to hospitals across several counties ""to make sure the burden doesn’t overwhelm Solano County’s"" health services and system. This also isn't impacting the number of beds for regular hospital patients.

""COVID-19 patients require specialized isolation rooms where the average hospital patient would not stay,"" Pauley said. 

He also explained by spreading the patients across multiple counties, the CDC isn't expanding the risk of exposure because every hospital, ""has CDC protocols in place."" 

""Nobody in the community or hospitals are at heightened risk,"" Pauley added.

The CDC expects more test results soon from those who were evacuated to Travis AFB"

It will be interesting if that's reflected in the market in the future as crypto is such a novelty and poorly understood at this point it's not sure any of that will shine through to the mainstream.

I see your PhD was on reddit's health information exchange during the Ebola outbreak. Have you noticed any trends between the Ebola outbreak and this outbreak that you can share? I've been paying attention to the ""infodemic"" issues mentioned by the WHO and CDC, and feel there's definitely a difference in the ""online public"" response to this outbreak than, say, the H1N1 outbreak that went around back in 2009 when I was in high school. In some ways, it feels like the spread of information(or misinformation) can very much act like a disease in itself. So, in what ways has social media/forums like Reddit aided or limited the ability of officials to deliver information to their public?  
  
It seems that in the absence of scientific information about this virus, speculation abounds, and fear (understandably so) seems to be the predominant ""mood"" on Reddit. A quick glance through the /r/coronavirus sub and you'll see dozens upon dozens of comments saying ""should have prepared weeks ago"" ""it's here"" ""everywhere is going to be like Wuhan"" ""this is a worst case scenario"" ""it's the end"" ""nightmare scenario"" ""society will collapse"" ""governments are suppressing numbers"". How do you recommend we regular Reddit-goers balance official reports (which seem to paint one picture of the situation), with the comments floating around pointing to the opposite? Besides fact-checking our sources, what else should we be doing to adequately assess the situation and make sure we are responding not only timely, but in a ""proportionate"" manner?  
  
Thank you!"

The headlines about a pandemic sound dire. But if the COVID-19 coronavirus hits Ohio, patients might not need to crowd emergency rooms and urgent cares.

Instead, doctors say, patients may be told to stay home to rest and drink water and electrolytes.

“The great majority of people would not need urgent medical care from a hospital or an ER,” said Dr. Keith Armitage, medical director for the University Hospitals Roe Green Center for Travel Medicine.

“It would be medicine for fever, like Tylenol, fluids to make sure you’re hydrated and only a small minority of people would need hospital care, particularly for shortness of breath that might need oxygen.”

According to Bruce Aylward, China has a 5 point system that they applied throughout their health system when the outbreak was declared, based on some key concepts of quarantine, containment, contact tracing, and social distancing:

1. Lateral organisation - every part of the system, from the national to state to the district and local, was reformed and organised to fight the coronavirus. New guidelines and manuals are published every single week in how to best to tackle the virus, and individuals on the ground are adapting it to their local situations.

2. Multi-institutional “war” footing - the state reacted as if in a war, and mobilised their entire bureaucracy to dealing with the virus. Different ministries that had different expertises or different access to goods or materials were included to best utilise resources and simplify delivering on targets and goals. Hospitals are put up in weeks, beds and equipment rolled out all over, masks being made, etc.

3. Radical technology - China has been utilising the latest in technological innovations, such as complex AI that does statistical modelling and analysis. The entire country is online, which has enabled them to isolate millions of people yet still provide them with services and information. Massive logistical undertaking utilising the ubiquitousness of smartphones and 4g/5g. As a result, they and healthcare workers get almost live updates and information, as well as advanced data modelling and being able to fully understand the virus and how it operates. Instead of seeing it as “SARS” or as “Flu”, China is seeing it for what it is: a novel, never seen before, unknown coronavirus. China has also been at the forefront of utilising big data on contact tracing.

4. National unity - Chinese citizens have willfully complied with quarantine and lockdowns. Everyone is “in” on preventing this virus spreading and acting together as a society. This quarantine is unprecedented in world history and speaks to the discipline and mentality of the Chinese that they all willingly stayed home to defeat the virus. Social distancing is also keenly applied which people are following, where you keep 2 meters apart at all times. Aylward worries that social unrest and the public not following along with the government is more likely in other countries than in China, where the key to success was a compliant citizenry who accepted the situation. 

5. Adaptability/Flexibility - While there are central guidelines updated weekly, and a structure and organisation from the top-down, what struck Aylward repeatedly was how everything is flexible enough to be adapted on the local level to local needs. Instead of exhausting the medical system by having the same response throughout the country, each district was essentially tailored to utilise parts of the guidelines that were needed for their own situation. This was found throughout, a high degree of flexibility so not everything followed a rigid system. The basics and fundamentals were all there throughout the different healthcare systems that were looked at, but highly tailored.

Hope this summary helps."

This is actually not true. This idea may have risen from previously reported discrepancies but those were unrelated to the test itself. There were issues of faulty testing kits, incorrect linking of samples to patients, and adjustments to what is considered positive/negative. These have been resolved. 

If you have coronavirus, you will test positive even if you don't show symptoms. The problem is that people who don't show symptoms will likely not be in a position to get tested unless they are identified as being in close contact with a confirmed case"

The nature of the conversation is the same though - conspiracy theories seem to follow the same patterns, such as [1] What don't you like? The Chinese? Eating Animals? Bill Gates? Blame it for coronavirus! [2] It's a bioweapon! (nb - it's not) [3] It's all a plot by Donald Trump/Batman/Putin/The CPP to [do whatever you don't want them to]. The same general questions come up (can I catch it from my dog? On a bus? In a swimming pool?), and the same general discussion (what should I stockpile? Should I travel?). So the kind of conversations are the same, but keeping on top of them is harder because of the volume. Like SARS-Cov2 itself, really. 

I don't think reddit or anything else prevents officials from delivering proper information. I still don't think official agencies use social media enough. I also think that most people are sensible enough to be able to sort the truth from the misinformation and mistakes - people who want to find a conspiracy will find one, people who don't won't just blindly accept that China has released a genetically engineered bioweapon on the world because (why? actually, I've missed that part of the conspiracy theory...). A study I'd really like to do at some point is actually see not what conspiracy theories are circulated but (a) how many people believe them and (b) why. We sort of looked at this in our paper on incorrect information online (here) [https://www.jmir.org/2016/1/e4/] but not in the detail I'd like. 

Most people aren't stupid, but I think the mainstream media and politicians like to think they're fooled by fake news because otherwise they'd have to accept that people voted for Donald Trump and Brexit because they wanted to, and if they want them to vote a different way they might have to actually engage with them, listen to their concerns and address them. Much easier to just call them stupid and attack a technology that provides access to all the knowledge in the world to them. You know not to believe everything you read on reddit, don't you? 

As for assessing official reports - just ask who the experts are. Who's more likely to be right - WHO, CDC, the NHS, 12 medical journals and your country's chief medical officer, who all agree with one another, or u/we_am_totes_dead!!! who has a two week posting history and thinks we're paid by the CPP? The official organisations all have their emergency plans/response procedures on line, so take a look at them. It's not in any country's interests - even evil dictatorships and (gulp!) communists, to keep their population as healthy as possible and not stand by while society breaks down. 

One thing you could do is look at histories of past outbreaks - such as the 1918-19 Influenza epidemic, which is the one that's probably going to end up being most similar in terms of number and severity of cases. How did society cope? What happened? The fact that all that happened was that a few more people than usual died of flu means that there weren't riots in the streets, mass starvations because food systems had broken down, etc. Older colleagues and relatives of mine talked about remembering their school closing during the 50s and 60s outbreaks, but not about ""that nice family of 6 in Acacia Avenue who all died within a week of one another"" or ""Swanage descending into cannibalism when there were no workers for the harvest"". That's probably a good place to start for keeping things in proportion."

Top health officials back off CDC messaging that coronavirus spread in U.S. is inevitable

In an afternoon news conference, Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar and other top health officials backed off the CDC’s strong warning earlier Tuesday that the spread of the coronavirus in the United States was inevitable.

The briefing was scheduled on short notice, and the markedly different tone came after the Dow fell more than 800 points in the wake of the CDC’s warning.

Instead, Azar, a top CDC official who was not on the CDC call earlier Tuesday and other leading public health officials said the United States wanted to have a large-scale response prepared “just in case” there was person-to-person spread.

“We believe the immediate risk here in the United States remains low, and we’re working hard to keep that risk low,” said Anne Schuchat, the CDC’s principal deputy director.

Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said during the news conference that the government was about a month and a half away from beginning early clinical safety tests for a coronavirus vaccine, adding that it would take a year to a year and a half before the vaccine was widely available."

The World Health Organization (WHO) chief said on Monday that the novel coronavirus epidemic (COVID-19) reached its peak between January 23 and February 2 and the number of new cases has since been steadily declining.  

WHO Director-General Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus made the remarks at a press briefing in Geneva.  

""We are encouraged by the continued decline in (new) cases in China,"" Dr. Tedros said, adding ""The key message that should give all countries hope, courage and confidence is that this virus can be contained."" 

""For the moment we are not witnessing the uncontained global spread of this virus, and we are not witnessing large-scale severe disease or death.""

Look, it doesn't really matter what states can test.  The 5 states still have to send the kits to the CDC in Atlanta and over the last 2 weeks they have run SEVEN tests per day.  

https://web.archive.org/web/20200211050045/https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/cases-in-us.html

If you compare total completed tests two weeks ago (318+12=330) versus the total completed tests today (426), you can see the CDC has only completed NINETY-SIX tests in the last two weeks. That's an average of 7 per day.  SEVEN.  I hope there aren't 8 people that might be infected in a single day in a country of 329 million!

FYI, the 5 states are from here : https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-health-usa-testing/tired-of-delays-us-labs-ask-fda-to-develop-their-own-coronavirus-tests-idUSKCN20I2G8

Good information on the Coronavirus from the WHO. They say that the epidemic probably peaked and plateaued in China in late January or early February. They also say that they believe that there is a possibility that the virus can be contained. They do not wish to use the word pandemic yet, because they don't believe the virus is spreading uncontrolling and causing mass death and destruction. Still, a pandemic is possible. The mortality rate of the virus in Wuhan is 2 to 4% while the mortality rate outside of Wuhan is estimated to be 0.7%. There is no evidence that the virus has mutated yet."

Doctors have tracked down the virus to come from a market in China, where people could buy bats that they could eat.

This is bad, as bats carry a lot of strong viruses. 

Now why does a bat do this? It's not it's fault, the virus works hard to hitch a ride on the bat. When a virus finds it's way into you and me, it will sneak it's way into one of our cells. Our cells are the little building blocks that make us, so they all have a factory that is used in making copies of themselves. This factory has instructions on making a cell and, what a virus does is add an extra page to the instructions to add the virus to the cell copy. 

Bats fly every night to find food and that is tiring work that they end up pretty beat up at the end of each night. Those cells have to work extra hard to repair the cells the bats lost over the night. 

You can see that if that bat had a virus in it, then it would make a lot of bad virus fellows because the bat keeps making new cells, so the bat has it's own system to attack those bad fellows. They have a police force in it's body to find cells with those bad instructions and attack them. They're really good at their job, which means the virus has to be extra good to ride with the bat.

We also have our own police force, but it's not as good as a bat, so it takes longer for our police to find them. If our police force finds that there is too much virus then it will start attacking every cell, making us super weak.

Our bodies are made to heal from this, but some people can't heal as strongly as others, especially when they get older.

But you won't die, when you do soccer for the first time and you're sore, you're probably tired for the night but ready to do the same thing the next day. You're grandfather though, it takes him to bounce back when he gets sore. If he gets a virus, it's harder for his body to repair itself, and there's a chance if he got this strong bat virus, that he might die"

 A 61-year-old man tested positive for coronavirus in São Paulo, according to information released by the Ministry of Health on Tuesday night (2/25). Now, he will undergo a second exam to confirm the diagnosis. The patient was in Italy and arrived in Brazil on Friday (2/21). Anvisa announced that it is looking for the list of people who were on the same flight to perform the quarantine procedures.

The patient is being treated at Hospital Israelita Albert Einstein, which notified the Ministry of Health on Tuesday afternoon. The hospital sent the test sample to the national reference laboratory, Instituto Adolfo Lutz, for counterproof and confirmation of the diagnosis. The result will be released on Wednesday morning (2/26)

The man traveled alone to Italy from 9 to 21 February. He stayed in the Lombardy region (north of the country), considered the focus of the COVID-19 outbreak. Upon returning, the patient had symptoms such as fever, dry cough, sore throat and runny nose.

Another three suspected cases of **coronavirus** are being investigated in São Paulo. They are all adults: in total, three from the capital (including the patient probably infected) and one from Bauru. In addition, all patients are travelers who came from any of the countries that entered the Ministry of Health's watch list.

Italy already has 322 confirmed cases of infection and is now on the list of countries that require attention, as well as Australia, China, South Korea, North Korea, Cambodia, Philippines, Japan, Malaysia, Vietnam, Singapore, Thailand, Germany, France, Iran and the United Arab Emirates.

Brazil received at least 5,300 flights in 2019 from these countries. The number of passengers who came from Italy, France, Germany and the United Arab Emirates totals 1.3 million people, according to information from the National Civil Aviation Agency (Anac). 

The Ministry of Health recalls that people who have symptoms such as fever, difficulty breathing, cough or runny nose and who have a history of travel in an area with circulating the virus or close contact with a suspected or confirmed case for the virus should seek health care. . Prevention can be done with the use of masks, hand hygiene and not sharing personal objects. 

Throughout Brazil, 54 suspected cases have already been ruled out. "

By Matt Phillips
Feb. 25, 2020
Updated 2:37 p.m. ET

Worried investors continued to dump stocks Tuesday in response to the threat of the spreading coronavirus outbreak, as American officials warned that it was only a matter of time before the infection spreads to the United States.

A day after its worst one-day slide in two years, the S&P 500 was down nearly 3 percent by Tuesday afternoon, a decline that put the blue chip index firmly in the red for the year.

For weeks, American investors had largely shrugged off the economic risks of the virus even as it disrupted global supply chains and shut down factories in China. As recently as last Wednesday, the S&P 500 was at a record high. But since then, growing outbreaks in Europe and elsewhere in Asia have raised fears that the virus will continue to drag on the global economy.

Monday was the worst day for American markets since February 2018, with the S&P 500 falling 3.4 percent after officials in Italy and South Korea reported new infections.
On Tuesday, the tumble continued. Declines in the S&P 500 were led by energy, industrial and materials shares, sectors of the market closely tied to Chinese demand for raw materials.


The sell-off accelerated after the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention warned Americans that they should brace for the likelihood that the coronavirus will spread to communities in the United States.

“It’s not so much of a question of if this will happen in this country any more, but a question of when this will happen,” said Dr. Nancy Messonnier, director of the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases. “We are asking the American public to prepare for the expectation that this might be bad.”

As stocks dropped sharply, investors moved into the safety of government bonds, pushing their prices up and yields down. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note fell to 1.31 percent, which would be a record low, a possible sign that investors expect growth in the United States to slow.

Investors could face more wild rides as the coronavirus outbreak spreads further, crimping consumer demand and snarling the world’s supply chains.
“The emergence of a large number of new cases in Italy has materially increased the risk of a sharp drop in consumer and business confidence in Europe, and potentially North America too if more cases are confirmed there in the coming days,” Mark Haefele, the chief investment officer at UBS’s global wealth management operations, said in an investment report.

The growing outbreaks of the virus in Europe, Asia and the Middle East have stoked fears that its spread will be difficult to contain, and market analysts in recent days have issued new warnings that the outbreak could drag down economies around the globe.

Economists at JPMorgan Chase wrote that they expected global growth to slow to a 1 percent annual pace in the first three months of the year, which would be the weakest quarter of the economic expansion that is now more than a decade long. In the United States, the general estimate for first-quarter domestic growth has slipped.

Markets around the globe have been affected this week.

Germany’s DAX and Britain’s FTSE 100 each fell nearly 2 percent on Tuesday, a day after European markets had their worst drop since 2016.

Shares also fell in most markets in Asia, led by Japan, which was closed for a holiday on Monday. The Nikkei 225 index tumbled more than 3.3 percent on Tuesday, although most other Asian markets fell at a much slower pace.

South Korea, which is facing the world’s second-largest outbreak of the virus outside China, was the bright spot: Share prices rebounded on Tuesday morning after enduring one of the sharpest drops of any large market around the world the day before. They ended up 1.2 percent.

Stock markets in commodity-exporting countries continued to suffer losses as traders worry that demand for their goods may decline if more countries suffer the kind of bruising deceleration in economic activity that China has endured. Australia’s stock market fell 1.6 percent on Tuesday.
The price of a barrel of benchmark American crude oil dropped more than 1 percent, to less than $51 on Tuesday. Oil prices have dropped about 17 percent this year, as investors have anticipated the weekslong immobilization of China’s economy, the world’s second largest.

China consumes more crude and commodities than any other country. Prices of those commodities have also fallen, dragging down the share prices of mining, chemical and fertilizer companies.

The girl who died last year to adenovirus has the same disease as me and was on the same medication, so if something such as coronavirus ever gets on campus I am at a real risk of dying if I catch it. Yeah it’s one thing when mistakes happen, but if you ask specifically if something has gluten in it and are told no, are you gonna immediately question it? If I did that then my life would be hell.

However, it gets much worse.  The only reason the fatality rate is 2% is because of how fast China worked to build 19 hospitals.  You see, 18% of the people that catch the virus become classified as a critical case.  

This means that 18% get pneumonia so bad that they have to be in a hospital hook up to an oxygen respirator, otherwise the fatality rate would be much higher.

So how bad it is depends on your nearby facility and what your government is planning to do in an outbreak because this thing is twice as contagious as the flu.

Age is also a factor.  Children will be fine but not adults.  It's a 2% fatality rate for ages under 40."

SINGAPORE - The coronavirus outbreak has gone beyond the point of containment, said a Harvard don.
""I think the virus is already spreading rapidly and actively in many places,"" said Professor Marc Lipsitch, director of the Centre for Communicable Disease Dynamics at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health.
He told The Straits Times: ""It seems extremely unlikely that the virus will be contained.""

More than 80,000 people worldwide have been infected in the Covid-19 outbreak and about 3,000 have died. This is already far more than the previous two coronavirus outbreaks - severe acute respiratory syndrome (Sars) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (Mers) - combined.
Covid-19 infections already spread to more than 30 countries worldwide so far.
For other countries, it’s a matter of “when and not if” they will be hit, said visiting professor Tikki Pang at the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy, National University of Singapore. 

“I think the genie is out of the bottle and containment is out of the question,” he added. “It’s now a matter of how more widely it spreads and having countries not yet affected be prepared for appearance of cases.”

While he thinks the outbreak has peaked in China and Singapore, it “may just be the beginning” for countries like Italy, Korea and Iran. 
Numbers have exploded recently in countries like South Korea and Italy, with more than 900 and 200 infected respectively. Both countries have had seven deaths. 

Prof Lipsitch thinks this may happen in other countries too. He said: ""In most countries, there is not much testing of infections unless they have connections to known cases or to China.""

His team from the school had upset Indonesian authorities by suggesting in a paper published earlier this month that countries like Indonesia and Thailand are probably missing cases, as the number reported are below expected levels, given their connection with China, and the number of infections that have been picked up by Singapore.

The team had used Singapore as the upper limit of case detection capacity, and said other countries' detection ranged from 11 to 40 per cent of Singapore's efforts.

The paper, which has not been peer reviewed, concluded that for each detected case outside of China, 1.8 cases go undetected.

Singapore now has 90 cases, and close to 3,000 people who may have been infected by these patients have been put under 14 days of quarantine in an effort to stem the spread of the virus.

Travellers returning from China are also required to comply with a 14-day stay-home notice.
Prof Lipsitch had predicted earlier this month that the virus is out of control and about half the world's population will likely be infected within the coming year, though many will have the disease in a mild form.
Asked if all Singapore has been doing has been is a waste of effort if the virus cannot be contained, Prof Pang gave an emphatic “definitely not” in response. 
“The key priority is to control the situation in Singapore - the global spread is a natural consequence of these kinds of events and there is nothing Singapore can do about it. At the same time, Singapore’s experience will provide valuable lessons for other countries.”
Concurring, Prof Lipsitch said Singapore’s efforts will slow the spread, and “delay is good”. 

He explained that delaying the spread of the virus in the country is good for at least four reasons:
- Fewer individuals get infected in total in a slower-moving epidemic;
- The burden on the health system is spread out, with lower peak demand for scarce resources;
- We will know more as time goes by, on about how to care for patients. So it is better to get the disease late than early;
- If we can slow the spread long enough, there may be new drugs, vaccines, or other countermeasures to aid in preventing and treating infection.
Prof Pang said he is particularly worried about hidden cases in countries with fragile healthcare systems such as Africa. Singapore and the rest of the world can take steps to prepare countries with weak healthcare systems for introduction of the virus. "

Coronaviruses and influenza viruses are different families of virus.

They were probably trying to manage your impression of how serious the novel coronavirus is, what the symptoms are like, and how it spreads. In those respects it is similar to the flu, though this virus is more serious than most forms of flu (edit: if you get infected) just like it's more serious than most forms of coronavirus. What impression did you initially give them of what you thought about coronavirus?

This coronavirus outbreak is a very specific novel virus and it's killing about 2-3% of the people who get infected, though they usually have some other underlying health problem, and it might be lower if we're underestimating how many people have been infected and never realized it.

All that I have heard about their response has been what I think an intelligent group of scientifically minded people would do to stop the spread.  Kudos, Singapore.  I wish the rest of us could have done so well.  Instead Trump proposed a budget which cuts funding to the CDC a few weeks ago during the budding phases of the outbreak during which he routinely under quoted the number of cases in the US (example if it was 5 and a 6th case had been announced earlier in the day he would not mention the 6th.  Either was not being briefed or deliberately understated.  Either reason is worrisome).  About 12 days ago, Trump also talked to Xi (supreme communist leader or whatever in China) and said China will win against coronavirus on Twitter.  Why the hell was advising him?  Granted I have a doctorate, but I am no genius, and I have been predicting this shit based on science and poor containment for weeks.  Who the hell is advising our president?  I am so tired of the “it’s just like the flu.”  Or Trump saying the virus is under control just yesterday.  It is clearly not. 

I’m not suggesting we panic, but approach it like Singapore.  They even told their people when the numbers were climbing that there was a possibility (and they were not there yet) of it becoming so widespread that they would ask people well enough to stay home allowing those who needed emergent care to be at the hospital.  The beauty of truth and science.  God, I love it.

The irony here is that this virus isn’t the end of the world, but the response to it has shown some serious problems we have dealing with large problems that require working together, an interdisciplinary approach, and intelligence.  Singapore has done this, but most of the world has failed to."

* Alleged bioweapon by Gen-U-Wine US Patriots^(TM) to facilitate an *autogolpe* by Trump

* Claims that industrial bleach (of the rather horrible sort that people force-feed to kids with autism to try to ""cure"" them) will cure you of the COVID-19
* Claims that various herbal preparations (everything from elderberry and black raspberry extracts to Chinese medicines which contain bitter almond seeds as an ingredient--the latter contain arsenic, of note) will cure you of the COVID-19
* Outright disease denialism--essentially claiming CoV-SARS-2 is not the cause of COVID-19, it's got to be Something Else that's causing illness
* Claims that ACE inhibitors (of the sort used for high blood pressure and coronary disease) will cure you of the COVID-19
* Claims (based on literally results in a test tube that have just STARTED to go through human trials in China) that various fun antimalarials will cure you of the COVID-19
* Claims that quinine in tonic water, or the old quinine tabs they used to sell for restless leg syndrome OTC, will cure you of the COVID-19 (I'm actually, honestly surprised we don't have a literal True Scotsman singing the praises of Irn-Bru in that regard yet)

* Claims that COVID-19 is a lot more deadly than...it's actually been shown to be in communities outside of China (COVID-19, outside of China, has an estimated death rate of around 1-2%, which is about the same as a bad ""swine flu"" year--not *good,* but not TEOTWAWKI; the panicmongers are essentially claiming COVID-19 has equivalent death tolls to smallpox if not *Ebola* of around 30-50% fatality rate even with treatment)
* Various unproven claims about COVID-19 that insinuate it's the next Ebola Zaire (including: claims of cytokine storms (not proven with COVID-19, and in fact evidence says no), claims of ""second time you get it you'll die because of immune fail"" (only one disease causes the mechanism responsible for this in humans, and that is dengue fever), claims of similar horrible conditions to some consequences coronavirus infections in animals (which don't occur in primates, much less humans, and aren't even conclusively proven to be the result of coronavirus infections entirely), claims COVID-19 does not actually cause long-lasting immunity (which is also not proven), etc. etc. etc. etc. and often all the above at once
* Various claims to the effect vaccines are impossible because vaccination will make the disease worse (which was based on a single study of a SARS vaccine in genetic knockout mice, using a type of vaccine that was never continued for use in humans, and not noting there have been successful SARS vaccines developed that do not cause bad effects in primates)
* And yes, in the two ""Bible-based cults"" affected (the NARasitized AoG megachurch in Singapore and the Shincheonji ""Moonies Clone"" in South Korea), there's even been claims to the effect COVID-19 exists because Satan is trying to oppress THEM directly and attack them with a Literal Demon Satan Virus to Stop Their Culty Work In The World Winning Souls For Their Cult.

Osmel Martinez Azcue returned from a work trip last month to China and discovered he was feeling flu-like symptoms. Worried about the coronavirus, the man decided to go to a Florida hospital to get tested, according to the Miami Herald. 

Testing revealed Mr Azcue had the flu, not the coronavirus. But his limited health insurance left him with a bill of $3,270 two weeks after his test. He will be responsible for $1,400 of that bill. 

Mr Azcue previously had insurance through the Affordable Care Act. **He picked that insurance as he makes $55,000 through his job at a medical-device company, and it does not provide a health insurance plan.**

Once he first purchased the plan, he was paying $278 per month. These premiums then shot up to $400 once his full salary kicked in, forcing the man to cancel the coverage and pay $180 per month for a limited plan through National General Insurance. 

**Mr Azcue discovered that not only does he owe $1,400 out of pocket, but he also needs to provide his insurer with three years of medical records to prove that the flu he got didn't relate to a pre-existing condition.** If for some reason the flu related to a pre-existing condition, then the insurer would no longer pay a portion of the man's bill. 

**Jackson Memorial Hospital, where Mr Azcue received his tests, told the Miami Herald more bills are on its way to the man.** It is not clear what else he will have to pay for after getting tested for the coronavirus."

At this point I'm past the entry point so it's not a buy position for me and I'm not someone who tries to predict day to day.

It could go up for another day or two, I'm not a psychic but based on what analysis I'm using, were inching closer and closer to the exit point. So I do not see volatility for much longer and I'm almost 100% sure it'll drop by the next week. Check in on the post and shame me if it's not correct.

Regardless my method has been backtested 20 years and returned 4000% gains so I trust it to give me relatively good entry and exit points.
Shame that volatility ETFs only return like 1/3rd of the VIXs performance tho.

Anyway, I agreed immensely with the poster I responded to and this is because I saw a spike in volatility being due. My analysis doesn't predict viruses. It predicts times of market volatility. Recession hype on this sub is way overblown and coronavirus effect is being overblown by news media. It's just a time of volatility right now.

I live EXTREMELY CLOSE to the city here where there are cases of this virus. My university is closed. Schools are closed. People are running at the spermarket every day like they were all about to close forever and they had to get ready for the end of the world. Our newspapers and facebook homes every day are focusing about new cases, spreading panic, giving uninformed news (""NEW CASE OF CORONAVIRUS"", but it's actually not confirmed and just someone coughing in a supermarket)  just to have views. Every minute. Every minute a new useless information just to spread panic. There are people out there selling samples of HAND SANITIZER for 500€ (a lot) and there are no face masks for doctors and nurses because people are buying them and wasting them FOR NO REASON. People think the face mask will protect them from the virus, but it's not true! Those must be used if you are ill so you don't accidentally sneeze and spread the virus all over and those dumb people are wasting them even if they are perfectly fine, while doctors in hospitals are running out of them! No critical thinking AT ALL!

So... If everyone is in panic (and everyone is, trust me), why I don't? Because it's a fact that the vast majority of people who die is at least 70 years old with maybe cancer or other previous illnesses. There is NO NEED to panic. It's just a flu and probably if nobody told us about this virus, nobody wouldn't even notice!  There's really NOTHING to fear.

Climate change and pollution are way worse, but nobody cares..."

Because the price going down is not a good reason to sell.  That's just herd mentality.

If your main concern is that the coronavirus will lead to some worldwide depression, it won't.  For sure, you might have stocks slump for a few months, and crypto could very likely follow that, but then recover as the disease starts coming under control.

""Amateur Radio Emergency Service (ARES) Los Angeles serves the hospitals in Los Angeles County with emergency communications services. This bulletin was sent to ARES members today regarding the mask shortage due to Corona Virus concerns. It provides a view into the procedures hospitals use to order critical supplies when local resources are insufficient. 

""The worldwide Coronavirus scare has led to a critical shortage of hospital sterile face masks at all LA County hospitals (pediatric masks also at Children’s), and in all counties in California. Our hospitals have followed an orderly procedure that has led, this week, to a proposed State of Emergency declaration on Gov. Newsom’s desk. I thought it would be a teachable moment to document how our hospitals follow procedure in this unusual and widespread Resource Request.

The first line of defense at the hospital level is to make a Resource request of the many Disaster Resource Centers through our friends at the LA County MAC:  [http://file.lacounty.gov/SDSInter/dhs/1005184_DRCBrochure2015.pdf](http://file.lacounty.gov/SDSInter/dhs/1005184_DRCBrochure2015.pdf)

DRCs are supply storage centers and require MAC-level County authorization to dispatch a supply. In the case of the masks, the supply was exhausted everywhere at all DRCs.

When the County can’t solve a Resource Request, they begin to follow FEMA procedure under the National Incident Command System (NIMS): [https://www.fema.gov/resource-management-mutual-aid](https://www.fema.gov/resource-management-mutual-aid)

And when the State has no method to resolve a Resource Request, the Governor may declare a State of Emergency which then bumps the Resource Request to the Federal Government:  [https://www.fema.gov/disaster-declaration-process#wcm-survey-target-id](https://www.fema.gov/disaster-declaration-process#wcm-survey-target-id)

And that’s where we’re at today with hospital face masks in the entire state. No doubt the Disaster Declaration will make major news soon.

ARES encourages all members really interested in emergency communications to study up on many FEMA procedures. A free series of Independent Study (IS) courses are available to you online:  [https://training.fema.gov/is/](https://training.fema.gov/is/)

ARES suggests FEMA NIMS/ICS courses IS-100, 200, 700, 800, with IS-300 and 400 for higher levels are all encouraged."""

Officials said there are currently not enough beds in Northern California hospitals equipped to care for people who have already become ill from the virus. Instead, they plan to move 50 passengers to an empty developmental site in Costa Mesa in Orange County.

But Costa Mesa officials said they will fight the plan, due to concerns for the health of their community. The city attorney successfully asked a judge to impose a restraining order.

Dr. Mark Schleiss, an infectious disease expert with the University of Minnesota medical school, said the government will now face challenges.

“This virus, it appears, is going to be firmly entrenched in the human population for some period of time,” Schleiss said.

So you think it is anti-Chinese hysteria that has caused China to impose strict quarantine conditions, or has mobilised the WHO and South Korean governments?

Which flu strain? There isn't a yearly flu strain. There are numerous flu strains that when combined accumulate to a higher number of infected and total mortality. That is because these vectors are already widespread throughout human populations. The lower level of concern is down to there being effective preventatives and treatments for most common strains, or at least it is more easy to adapt current flu vaccines and secondly, they are much less virulent with a significantly lower mortality rate than 2%. 

A better comparison would be swine flu, which is readily transmissible like coronavirus but far less virulent (about 100 times). Swine flu crossing into the human population resulted in the 2009 pandemic, infecting some 10-20%+ of the worlds people. Spectacular numbers.

But a few notable differences, coronavirus is similarly virulent to Spanish flu. It also has a long asymptomatic period. Worst case, quarantine measures fail completely and you get a pandemic like 2009s. So, if it keeps to a mortality rate of 2.3% and infects approx. 1.4 billion people, it could result in 32.2 million deaths.

So, that is the reason why scientists and governments take this issue so seriously. It isn't hysteria, why we don't end up with a death toll like that from a single strain is because of the tremendous resources being mobilised to stop the virus spread."

 I have an LGTOY saber of this style. My thoughts are the following:

For the 62usd shipped that I paid, it's amazing. Compared to my stupid 375usd Ultrasabers Manticore that I broke against a chair....this thing is great.

It's bright but not super evenly lit. I actually cut my blade down further to make it into a Shoto Saber. It looks even brighter now, due to the smaller blade. I even tried to upgrade it using a Saberz Starlight Blade. The Starlight looks really nice where the tip meets the blade (which seems to be their thing), but it didn't look any brighter. Then again, it's 4"" longer than the stock size of the LGT Saber, and about the same brightness. I think Starlight Blades benefit from premium LEDs/Sabers. I would say it's not worth it on these Aliexpress Sabers. I might cut the Starlight to Shoto length. Oh, and the Starlight makes the Saber significantly heavier. 

It has like 5 sound fonts and they're ok, but audio fidelity is not that good. Also, the swing detection and Flash on Clash is not the best. Acceptable for the price. 

It's very small and light. Perfect for spinning and what not. I got mine just before the Coronavirus thing and got it in about 2 weeks to LA. I ordered a second one to make a Saberstaff, but it's been delayed by about 4 weeks. Finally coming in this week. It's cool you can unscrew the pommel and screw one Saber into another.

Our upcoming trip (assuming coronavirus does not progress too much) and we were able to secure a sushiya and we had to reach out two months ahead and were not able to sit with the head chef (if that sort of thing matters to OP, then it's even more important to reach out sooner). 

OP also didn't mention how many people they're traveling with. It can be incredibly difficult to book for more than 2-4 people without some form of compromise. 

Also, from what I've heard, it's really bad form to cancel your reservations for restaurants. I've heard about how some people reserve then cancel when they secure a reservation to a nicer spot.

Current domestic (156) + cruise ship (671) cases in Japan is around 956. That means around 5%. 

The tweet from BNO does not state a source or how many are critical vs serious based on the previous designations we have heard, though I imagine it is from the NHK article posted earlier. Unfortunately that article is also vague in its determination of serious vs critical. 

Based on the [tweets from the Minister of Defense](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/f9a5f4/statistics_from_japan_minister_of_defense/) there were 14 confirmed to be in what we would call ""critical"" condition, however there are also 39 unknown. Unfortunately without knowing the details of those remaining 39 its hard to tell what this number really means.

The good news is that even if they are all in critical condition, that puts us only at 5% rate of critical condition, in line with what we have seen before. 

Beyond that though there is quite a bit of evidence to support these 50 representing both serious *and* critical cases, meaning that both serious and critical case rates are significantly lower than previosly reported (5% and around 1-2% respectively). And this is among a cohort of primarily elderly patients. 

That all sounds a bit too good to be true, especially based off a few tweets, but is something to consider. Unfortunately it is *also* quite early and we still have more individuals getting sick-- we may see some people make a turn for the worse in the next few weeks inflating these numbers."

Even then, you are left with a major dent in Chinese economic activity as the entire country was pretty much on lockdown for 1.5 months.

First of all, this is not the sub for this, not only for the topic, but also because there's not many Italian people on this sub. You should post on r/italy

Secondarily don't you worry about putting on a mask and don't judge others who don't for 2 reasons, which are that masks are completely useless against the virus, unless they have a filter (and not many people have those since they cost a lot and I doubt you have them too), and that not everyone has had the chance or the money to buy a mask, since their price is now higher and they are way less. All this without even counting that, in Italy, since the living conditions and healthcare are very good, the virus is not much worse than a simple flu, in fact everyone that died from it was 75 or more.

Then let's count the fact you were on a video chat app, which is a place where people, in general, go to fuck around, show their dick or find girls, so no wonder they were dumbasses and skipped fast. These people should not be taken as examples of Italian people in general.

Plus the beating up of Asian people did not only happen in Italy, so it's not like our population is worse than others, and Coronavirus was not the reason why they beat up those Asians, but it was merely an excuse.

All this being said there's tons of racists in Italy, in particular with the Salvini appreciation levels getting higher and higher, so be strong. I'm sure nothing's going to happen to you.

P.S: I don't think insulting racists is going to help you or change anything even if I agree with you.

P.P.S: I don't know if you were referring to racists only or to Italians in general, but you should know Italians in general know English, but if you want to be sure to find someone who speaks it, young people definitely do, so you will have 0 problems on Reddit."

As it stands, as a smoker and even as a very new nonsmoker, if I get sick, I'm probably not going to make it.

But, if I don't get this virus and still don't smoke, each day I will decrease my likelihood of getting sick and possibly dying from the dozens of things that would take me down anyway. 

The coronavirus did contribute to my decision to quit before the nice weather, those few weeks aren't going to do anything but prolong a nasty vice. 

However, COPD, cancers, hardened arteries/veins, being sedentary, those are way more likely than the coronavirus for all of us smokers.

Everyone in my house is going on as normal and are oblivious.

I hope he's right and that I am worrying about nothing, We live 30 miles away from NYC and I feel there will be many cases hitting here soon."

2020-02-25,Taellion,Coronavirus,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/f9mnd7/how_deadly_is_the_coronavirus/fislziw/,"he virulence (R0) of SARS-CoV-2 is estimated between 1.4-6.49, with a mean estimate of 3.28[[1](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/coronavirus-may-spread-faster-than-who-estimate#Higher-estimates-than-WHO-predict)] . This mean estimate is much higher than the seasonal flu, which has an R0 of 1.3[[2](https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2020/01/how-fast-and-far-will-new-coronavirus-spread/605632/)] . What this means is that SARS-CoV-2 spreads signficantly faster than the seasonal flu. 

 1. The Case Fatality Rate (CFR) of SARS-CoV-2 is at least 2-3%[[3](https://academic.oup.com/ajcp/advance-article/doi/10.1093/ajcp/aqaa029/5735509)] . This is 20-30 times higher than the CFR of the season flu, which is around .1%[[4](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/02/03/the-flu-has-already-killed-10000-across-us-as-world-frets-over-coronavirus.html)] . 

 2. SARS-CoV-2 can be transmitted without the infected showing any symptoms[[5](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2762028)] . This makes it much more difficult to control. 

 3. Roughly 20% of SARS-CoV-2 infections result in serious symptoms that require medical intervention[[6](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/coronavirus-81-of-cases-are-mild-study-says#80.9%-of-the-cases-are-mild)] . This is more than 10 times the hospitalization rate of the seasonal flu[[7](https://www.cdc.gov/flu/about/burden/index.html)].

 4. Symptoms from SARS-CoV-2 can persist over a month[[8](https://www.thelancet.com/pb-assets/Lancet/pdfs/S2213260020300795.pdf)] compared to the seasonal flu where symptoms typically tend to clear after 5 days[[9](https://www.emedicinehealth.com/flu_in_adults/article_em.htm)] .

 5. There is no vaccine for SARS-CoV-2[[10](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/about/prevention-treatment.html)] whereas people regularly get annual flu shots. 

 6. There is no [herd immunity](https://www.ovg.ox.ac.uk/news/herd-immunity-how-does-it-work) for SARS-CoV-2 which means that it can theoretically infect the entire population. See, for example, a [Korean psychiatric department where the virus infected 99/102 people](https://twitter.com/covid_19news/status/1231581727438467072?s=21). 

Now, consider the multiplicative effect that all of these attributes have for the virus. Compared to the seasonal flu, SARS-CoV-2 (1) spreads faster; (2) kills far more; (3) is harder to control; (4) requires use of far more medical resources; (5) for far longer a period of time; (6) has no effective treatment; and (7) can infect entire populations. 

These factors mean that SARS-CoV-2, if left unchecked, is far more likely to overwhelm a country's medical infrastructure. Additionally, when medical infrastructure is overwhelmed, the CFR will skyrocket because we know that 20% of cases require medical intervention. 

This virus is potentially devastating if containment measures fail. Far worse than the seasonal flu.

#Abstract

##Objective:
 To provide reliable evidence of evidence-based medicine for the treatment and prevention of the 2019 novel coronavirus(2019-nCoV) by analyzing all the published studies on the clinical characteristics of patients with 2019-nCoV. 

##Methods
: PubMed,Cochrane Library,Embase and other databases were searched. Some studies on the clinical characteristics of 2019-nCoV infection were collected for Meta-analysis .

##Results: 
9 studies were included in Meta-analysis, including a total of 50404 patients with 2019-nCoV infection.

According to Meta-analysis, among the clinical characteristics of patients with 2019-nCoV infection, the incidence of fever is 90.9% , the incidence of cough is 70.8%, and the incidence of muscle soreness or fatigue is 41%. 

#***The incidence of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) was 14.8%, the incidence of abnormal chest CT was 95.6%, the proportion of severe cases in all infected cases was 21.3%, and the mortality rate of patients with 2019-nCoV infection was 4.8%***

## Conclusion:
 Fever and cough are the most common symptoms in patients with 2019-nCoV infection, and most of them have abnormal chest CT examination.

Some people have muscle soreness or fatigue, ARDS. 

Diarrhea, hemoptysis, headache, sore throat, shock and other symptoms only occur in a small number of patients.

*The mortality rate of patients with 2019-nCoV infection was lower than that of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SRAS) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS)*"

Current status of testing is:

[Sensitivity of Chest CT for COVID-19: Comparison to RT-PCR](https://pubs.rsna.org/doi/10.1148/radiol.2020200432)

>Discussion

>In our series, the sensitivity of chest CT was greater than that of RT-PCR (98% vs 71%, respectively, p<.001). The reasons for the low efficiency of viral nucleic acid detection may include: 1) immature development of nucleic acid detection technology; 2) variation in detection rate from different manufacturers; 3) low patient viral load; or 4) improper clinical sampling. The reasons for the relatively lower RT-PCR detection rate in our sample compared to a prior report are unknown (3). *Our results support the use of chest CT for screening for COVD-19 for patients with clinical and epidemiologic features compatible with COVID-19 infection particularly when RT-PCR testing is negative.*

(My note: concurrent radiograph findings are important.  Other cases indicate CT signs exist prior to apparent density changes on typical radiographs.)

That's not to say RT-PCR isn't necessary, because radiological findings, alone, are not complete differentials (from legionella pneumonia, for example.)  Visible changes, when present, on CT tend to appear at the disease mid-point, in all serious cases, as far as I'm aware.

There are a couple of other alternatives:  the CDC is working on a [Serology Test for COVID-19.](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/about/testing.html)  Specific details about the CDC RT-PCR kit are on that page, incidentally.

>The serology test will look for the presence of antibodies, which are specific proteins made in response to infections.  Antibodies can be found in the blood and in other tissues of those who are tested after infection.  The antibodies detected by this test indicate that a person had an immune response to SARS-CoV-2, whether symptoms developed from infection or the infection was asymptomatic.  **Antibody test results are important in detecting infections with few or no symptoms.**

The gold standard for viral diagnostic confirmation is viral isolation (because it guarantees live virus, which RT-PCR does not:)  the CDC has grown SARS-CoV2 in cell culture.  There are higher confidences when the sample for viral isolation is from an implicated lung area.  Sampling can be performed by bronchoscopy."

One of the confirmed cases from the Diamond Princess cruise ship (one who got back to the US) has been posting blogs on his radio station's website:
** [Here is the latest one] (https://www.hometownstation.com/santa-clarita-news/editorials/coronavirus-patient-from-santa-clarita-continues-to-clear-misconceptions-about-covid-19-part-13-314467) **

One of this earlier blogs had this passage:
> Despite all the monitors attached to me, there is no medication being given. **My only medication is (drum roll, please) Gatorade.** This virus is so unknown, there is no cure except to allow it to work its way through my system. There are no antibiotics, no IVs, not even nose drops, just Gatorade.

He just turned 60 and seems to be doing quite well. And it's weird because his wife didn't contract the virus. And another married couple on the cruise had something similar; the wife got the coronavirus and the husband didn't catch it.


It seems like good news to me; if you are getting nervous, read his blogs. There are 13 of them (they're not too long) and they give you an idea of what it's like for someone who has the virus and is being actively quarantined. If he's a bit upbeat and optimistic, hopefully it helps everyone nervous feel a bit better."

Right now, my biggest concern about the coronavirus is the possibility of false information being spread on social media and for people to go into panic. The best thing you can do for yourself now is to take measures against catching/spreading the virus (Washing your hands for 20 seconds, wearing protective gear, etc.), making sure that you are updated on news from trusted sources of media (The World Health Organization is a good one to start), check up on loved ones if you are able (through skype/facetime/telephone if physical contact isn't possible) and most importantly to not panic.

I understand that things might be scary, but you are not alone and things will get better."

The Italian citizen suffering from coronavirus had several business meetings in Craiova, between 18 and 22 February. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs confirmed the information. The 71-year-old man  was confirmed with coronavirus in Rimini, Italy. He is currently hospitalized, according to Corriere Romagna . 

UPDATE 18:20.  Between February 18 and February 22, the man was visiting his mother-in-law, and had several business meetings in Craiova. The man has Italian citizenship, and his wife is Romanian, from Gorj. Authorities now have to redo the man's route. After the Romanian authorities have managed to have all the data and the route of the two spouses, they will be able to determine if there are other infected persons in Romania. The MAE confirmed the information regarding his visit to Craiova.

""Following the information regarding the case of the 71-year-old citizen, found to be infected with the COVID-19 virus, the Strategic Communication Group makes the following details:

The man has Italian citizenship and, according to the information available at the moment, was in Romania, in Craiova, from February 18 to 22,
during which time the man visited relatives of his wife, a Romanian citizen, and had several business meetings, and the Romanian authorities activated the necessary protocols in this type of situation, an investigation will be initiated. and ordered quarantine or isolation measures, as the case may be, ""according to a statement submitted by the Strategic Communication Group.

""Regarding the information conveyed in the media regarding the confirmation of a case of infection with COVID-19 in Italy, Rimini, MAE, through the Romanian Embassy in Rome, has taken, as a matter of urgency, steps near the local authorities to obtain some additional information, including the citizenship of the patient and regarding his possible stay on the Romanian territory.
On the basis of the information obtained, the necessary measures will be taken on the Romanian territory ” , it is stated in a statement of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.

The 71-year-old Italian was in Romania for a hunting party. The man owns a bar in Valconca, on the east coast of Italy, a few km from Cattolica. The authorities have made a list of the employees who work in the Italian-owned bar for their analysis. Investigations are also being made to reconstruct its route.

The Italian health authorities keep the family under observation, but also the two persons who accompanied him on the trip from Romania.

The Italian returned from Romania at the end of last week. He made a trip to the country with two people, most likely relatives. On his return, the man coughed, which is why he went to the Cattolica Hospital on Monday. He was later taken to Rimini, where the coronavirus test was positive.

Now, the man is admitted to the infectious diseases department of the hospital in Rimini, his life not being endangered.

The NFL isn't as profitable as you want it to be. The value in owning an NFL team is the equity in the franchise, not the annual income. Lions are worth approximately $2b, $73m in operating income works out to be <4% return. In today's economy (minus the coronavirus stock market scare), that's a reallllly awful rate of return."

If you don't have an expectorant, thyme (the kitchen herb) works that way, too. A syrup or tea or throw some in the soup. 

From respiratory care nurse on Reddit:

Your goal as a home healthcare provider is to build and support the immune system, limit the progression of the disease, and effectively communicate with local healthcare providers to determine if additional care or hospitalization is needed.

Start a medical folder or chart for each person while everyone is still healthy if possible. Have this on hand during phone calls with medical providers and for medical care/hospitalizations. 

 • Birthday 

 • Height and Weight

 • Medical history: diagnoses, surgeries, hospitalizations

 • Medications-prescription and herbal supplements: name, dose, frequency. For as needed medications like Tylenol or Tums, note the date and time taken.

 • Normal vital signs: Pulse beats per minute. Temperature. Respirations per minute. Blood Oxygen Level % (pulse oximeters can be purchased online and in drug stores inexpensively). Pain level on a scale of 0-10 including: location, duration, description. Tracking for seven to ten days at different times should be sufficient to establish a baseline. *Blood pressure readings at home can be inaccurate and cause alarm so unless you have a loved one with bp issues, I might skip bp. To double check an at home bp reading, you can visit your local pharmacy. You may also want to purchase a stethoscope and take an online crash course on listening to the various breath sounds.

 • Include: a chart with normal vital signs by age group, charts for proper Tylenol and Ibuprofen doses by age/weight. These can be given at the same time. Tylenol every 4 hours, Ibuprofen every 6. Some doctors recommend alternating every 3 hours to have continuous coverage.

 • Copy of ID and insurance card if you have one.

 • Research your medical system/insurance. Find out who your primary care doctor is, if your insurance covers telephone nurses or doctors, in home visits, urgent care centers, and emergency rooms. Keep these names, numbers, and locations in each folder. 

When illness begins:

 • Note onset date, symptoms, and vital signs every 4-8 hours depending on severity.

 • Note calls to physicians and their advice.

 • Note interventions. As symptoms become more severe also document vital signs before and after to see if what you are doing is working. 

Caring for someone with viral respiratory symptoms:

 • Wash your hands with soap and water before and after each contact. Wear a protective mask if available.

 • Keep the windows of the room open if temperature permits or air out room several times a day.

 • Encourage patient to spend time outside daily in the sunshine in the yard, porch, or on a patio if possible to limit exposure to others.

 • Change bedding daily, clothing twice daily.

 • Morning and night showers with steam. 

 • Drink 2 liters of water per day (includes soups and teas). Urine should be slightly yellow in color, darker urine indicates dehydration.

 • Caffeine in green tea or coffee can help to open the airways.

 • Saline nebulizer or saltwater steam inhalation every 4 hours to coat the lungs with antimicrobial properties.

 • Incentive spirometer or deep breathing exercises every 2 hours except when sleeping.

 • Allow fever up to 102 if they can stand it. Your body raises the temperature to assist the immune system.

 • Warm herbal teas to soothe the throat from coughing (peppermint, eucalyptus, fenugreek, ginger, licorice).

 • Salt water gargle (children under 6 and elderly may not be able to do this safely)

 • Elderberry syrup, Vitamin C, and garlic (1-2 raw cloves/day) as antivirals-Begin within 48 hours of symptom onset for best results.

 • Multivitamins twice daily

 • Chest percussion/postural draining of the lungs twice daily if the patient is young, elderly, not coughing well, or oxygen saturations are below their normal reading. https://www.cff.org/Life-With-CF/Treatments-and-Therapies/Airway-Clearance/Basics-of-Postural-Drainage-and-Percussion/

To reduce a fever without medication or while you’re waiting: Strip clothes down to a T-shirt and underwear, limit bedding to a flat sheet. Turn on a room fan. Use warm washcloths to wipe down the patient’s arms, legs, back, face. (You are simulating sweating.) Ice packs wrapped in towels can be placed under armpits, behind the neck, at the lower back or groin, and behind knees. Cool water, ice chips, or popsicles can be given.*Do not submerge the patient in water. You can cause shock. The goal is to slowly lower the temperature and reverse the feedback loop.Temperature should normalize, but may return in a few hours. This cycle is okay and normal. Fever helps the immune system, but you do want to treat it if the fever is making the patient uncomfortable or if the temperature rises to 102.

“Hospitals are only an intermediate stage of civilization, never intended … to take in the whole sick population. May we hope that the day will come … when every poor sick person will have the opportunity of a share in a district sick-nurse at home.” – Florence Nightingale

***Please note: You should review your medical plan with your physician before illness sets in. Make sure that the herbal remedies, medications, and medical plan for your family is appropriate for their age, medical history, and medical conditions and that nothing listed here is contraindicated. Encourage and ask your healthcare provider for other ideas or interventions to best prepare. Note also that in an emergency internet access may not be available, so it is important to have a paper record."

I've known several other people who were out sick with fevers and then had ""bronchitis"" afterwards. Coincidence? Possibly. But it's suspicious. Not only that, but I personally know a guy who just went on a trip to Japan and Singapore and then flew back like it's nothing. They checked him for fever at the airport but that's it. Thankfully he hasn't gotten sick, but how many others have traveled to areas where the virus is spreading and come back?

I will be traveling to Japan at the end of March and returning the beginning of April. I think it is foolish to cancel a trip at this point unless you have pre-existing conditions and/or have members joining you on your trip that are either old age or a very young child which could lead to a very bad situation...but  this same evaluation holds true if you caught the common flu as well. Yes, it is concerning that there are unknowns about this virus but given that fact that the virus is very likely no more hazardous than the common flu and you have folks recovering from it - this really shouldn't be something to write home about.

For me, a worst case scenario would be catching the virus and then subsequently spending 2 weeks in quarantine on arrival back in the US. Lucky for me, I can work remotely so there's really no show stoppers here. With all that being said, it's hard to even make a judgement call until right before your trip. This virus could do a 180 in the span of 2 weeks. So again, cancelling a trip right now seems very foolish in my personal opinion.

Please think hard about your reservations and risk tolerance before you cancel what could be a once in a lifetime opportunity. Life is full of risks that are much more hazardous to your health at a much higher probability on a daily basis than this damn coronavirus."

The CDC isn't testing for coronavirus (unless you've come from China or had close contact with a person recently in China).  If they don't test, they can deny localized transmission (I'm reminded of the meme of the dog sitting at the table drinking coffee saying, ""this is fine"", as the house burns around him).   Florida has already said they won't inform the public if there are confirmed cases, citing hippa laws (which don't apply to epidemics because of exceptions for public health safety).  Costa Mesa, California sued the Feds because they were going  to transfer up to 50 confirmed cases of coronavirus to the city (from the Diamond Princess).  California has told 7,600 people to self quarantine.  It's already here.  They're trying to prevent panic, but they're leaving the public vulnerable, and will cause more infection to spread rapidly (and more deaths) .

I’ll say the magic two words, “interstate commerce.” Your respite lies with article 3 to limit the powers of article 1, but they absolutely have the power to enact such legislation, don’t kid yourself.

Your examples are perfect.

Speed limits and drinking age are absolutely overreach on the federal level - it's sortof understood.   Congress had to threaten to not give ""federal funds"" to whip the States into line.

It is wrong to enact defacto national policy/law this way.  It circumvents the States' role in the process.  (Also why the 17th should be repealed, but that is another discussion.)

I also object to the recently proposed Republican law to withhold funds to States that give licenses to illegals.  I for sure took some grief here about that.

""Automatic weapon bans...""

(disregarding FOPA 1986 and the Hughes Amendment for sake of discussion)

Automatic weapons are not banned at the Federal level.  They are taxed.  (An actual power of congress!)  In 1934, congress *still knew its boundaries, and that they could not outright ban machineguns* - so they taxed them under the National Firearms Act.  No criminal bothers with that, so you could get the criminal for not having the Federal tax stamp.

And depending on your State, you can absolutely, to this day, own a machinegun with a nifty $200 1934 stamp.


>To preempt the inevitable “not interstate commerce related” counter argument, I’ll use OPs coronavirus fearmongering as a perfect situation which could be used as justification. “Virus spread because Americans are uninsured. We need to ensure people can get treatment to prevent pandemics which have crippled our economy.” Easy. 


Nono!  Virus spread has nothing at all to do with ""national healthcare"" - that is silly!  But I totally believe some would say it!

If this thing goes pandemic-bad, the government will deal with quarantines and emergency shit - something I would expect.   

Me paying for my own healthcare or someone else paying for it doesn't make any difference!

- Iger putting out his book does indicate he was looking to deuce sooner than later considering some of the tea he spilled.
- Still, Kim Masters made a good point about why now? 20th Century is leaderless, Disney+ costs are rising, and the impact of Coronavirus on parks and the film studio are still TBD.
- Chapek does have the film studio connections Iger desired (he ran home entertainment and later studio distribution + parks relationships with Disney silos), but he was never a creative exec like Iger or Eisner. 
- Seems like a lesser of two evils choice between him and Mayer.
- Plus, his Parks rep, as noted by the posters here, is one of a profit monger, as opposed to a value adder. Iger was the later, Eisner was a mix of the two. So the thinking is Iger brought all the assets to Disney and Chapek will spend his tenure maximizing dollars signs (via cost cutting??)?

Then the press release rub.

> Robert A. Iger assumes the role of Executive Chairman and will direct the Company’s **creative endeavors**, while leading the Board. 

and 

> Mr. Chapek will report to the Executive Chairman, Mr. Iger, and the Board of Directors. 

So Chapek is still under Iger in a sense and is NOT overseeing anything creative until Iger exits Dec 2021. Hmmm. Seems like a polite way of admitting they don't fully trust Chapek to take over the creative relationships Iger built and if any of the silo heads get rubbed the wrong way during the transition, no harm no foul and Chapek gets an axe."

We showered and sanitized and masked up and are at urgent care now to test for the flu per Johns Hopkins advice.

Nowadays, I don't think there is much (if any) reality to any of the events portrayed on the news.  I see the news as a serious, daily content delivery system.  Its a form of entertainment.  If reality is presented on the news, I think it would only be because it is useful in some way, in helping to manage the population.
