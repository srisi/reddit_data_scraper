>In a recent study, mice experiments demonstrated that viral load in respiratory specimens was proportional to viral inocula in patients infected with SARS-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) (6)

Viral inocula size refers to the number of viruses you were exposed to, while viral load refers to the number of viruses in your bloodstream/lungs/whatever after the disease develops. The number of viruses you are exposed to affects how many viruses would be detected in samples from you later on. In addition, it affects clinical outcomes:

>Severity of illness did not differ between block E patients and non-E block patients when they were first seen at the hospital, despite higher viral load in block E patients. However, the death rate was higher in block E. We have previously demonstrated that patients with high initial and peak viral loads in nasopharyngeal samples were more likely to show a less favorable disease course and lower survival rate (8,18). Patients living in E7 who had highest nasopharyngeal viral loads explains why their death rate was higher than for those living in other units. The dilution effect resulted in a decreased viral load as the disease spread to other units and in a lower death rate.

The probability of actually getting sick also depends on viral inocula, as you usually would not get sick from a single virus.

The reason why it matters is because your immune takes a while to respond properly. If the virus cannot multiply into large enough numbers before a strong immune reaction, you are less likely to die, and if the inocula size is small enough you might not even have any symptoms (ie. you might not really ""get sick""). This is why casual contact is less concerning."

\- Most BTFD guys here regard only 2 statistics in the Coronavirus scare, # infected and # dead.  They consistently insist, ""it's only the flu"" or ""it's a China problem."" These statements totally miss the point. Aside from the initial shock, markets don't go down because of people dying. They go down due to uncertainty or loss of earnings. Even if we had 25k dead and 500k infected today, as long as China remained open for business, stocks wouldn't crash. HOWEVER, IF businesses remain shut, people remain quarantined, and no one knows for sure when factories would start up again, then that would a huge negative for the markets. 

We're conditioned to BTFD and believe every week will be the same (maybe down Monday, but up Tues-Fri!). Due to the following points, next week should not be:

\- If there are secondary infections in other countries besides China, these will begin to show up next week. 

\- If excessive numbers of secondary infections appear in the US, then expect some sort of preliminary containment measure, which will undoubtedly be blown out of proportion by the media.

\- VIX futures remained above 16 during a +3.5% week

\- Gold remains elevated, while silver got beat up (more industrial applications).

\- This week saw a few Chinese companies declaring ""force majeure."" I anticipate this trend to continue and even escalate.

Feb. 7, 2020, 7:10 p.m. ET
One patient, admitted to a hospital in Wuhan, China, infected at least 10 health care workers and four other patients with the coronavirus that has sickened more than 31,000 people, killed 600 and reached two dozen other countries.

The case was just one disturbing detail in a new report on 138 patients in Wuhan that helps explain how the illness progresses and how it spreads.

The report, one of two published on Friday by JAMA, is among the most comprehensive articles to date about people infected with the newly identified virus.

The patients ranged in age from 22 to 92, with a median of 56 years, and were admitted to Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University from Jan. 1 to Jan 28. Many of them — 41 percent — were presumed to have caught the virus in the hospital, including 17 people who had been admitted for other illnesses, and 40 health care workers.

The patient who infected so many health workers had been placed in a surgical ward because of abdominal symptoms, and the coronavirus was not initially suspected. Four other patients in that ward also contracted the disease, presumably from the first patient.

The incident was a chilling reminder of the “super-spreaders” in outbreaks of other coronavirus diseases, SARS and MERS — patients who infected huge numbers of other people, sometimes dozens. The phenomenon is poorly understood and unpredictable, an epidemiologist’s nightmare. Super-spreaders led to considerable transmission of MERS and SARS inside hospitals.

Reporting on Friday in JAMA, the authors said their data suggested that rapid person-to-person spread of the virus had occurred among their cases. That was in part because of patients like the one admitted to the surgical department, whose symptoms misled doctors into suspecting other illnesses and failing to take precautions to prevent spread of the virus until it was too late.

About 10 percent of the patients did not initially have the usual symptoms, cough and fever, but instead had diarrhea and nausea first. Other uncommon symptoms included headache, dizziness and abdominal pain.

Another cause for concern was that some patients who at first appeared mildly or moderately ill then took a turn for the worse several days or even a week into their illness. The median time from their first symptoms to when they became short of breath was five days; to hospitalization, seven days; and to severe breathing trouble, eight days. Experts say that pattern means patients must be carefully monitored, and it is not safe to assume that someone who seems to be doing well early on is out of the woods.

The finding is a “heads up” to doctors to keep an eye on these patients, Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said in a recorded interview posted by JAMA.

Like previous reports on coronavirus patients, this one found that older people and those with underlying health problems like diabetes, heart disease or cancer tended to become more severely ill than younger, healthier patients.

Over all, about 26 percent of the 138 patients needed intensive care; their median age was 66, compared with a median of 51 years for those who did not require intensive care.

For this series of patients, the death rate was 4.3 percent, which is higher than the estimates coming from other parts of China. The reason is not known, and the figures may change as more information is gathered."

*So far, very few young children seem to be falling ill. The pattern was seen in outbreaks of SARS and MERS, too.* 

*At play in a condominium complex in Beijing last month. Young children do not seem as affected by the new coronavirus, experts say.* 

 **By** **Apoorva Mandavilli** 

The new coronavirus has infected more than 28,000 people, and at least 563 have died. But relatively few children appear to have developed severe symptoms so far, according to the available data.

“The median age of patients is between 49 and 56 years,” according to [a report published on Wednesday in JAMA](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2760782). “Cases in children have been rare.”

So why aren’t more children getting sick?

“My strong, educated guess is that younger people are getting infected, but they get the relatively milder disease,” said Dr. Malik Peiris, chief of virology at the University of Hong Kong, who has developed a diagnostic test for the new coronavirus.

Scientists may not be seeing more infected children because “we don’t have data on the milder cases,” he said.

“If this coronavirus spreads worldwide, and it spreads as widely as the seasonal flu does, probably we’ll see more,” he added.

 In one published case, a 10-year-old traveled to Wuhan, the epicenter of the outbreak, with his family. Upon returning to Shenzhen, the other infected family members, ranging in age from 36 to 66, [developed fever, sore throat, diarrhea and pneumonia](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(20)30154-9/fulltext). 

 The child, too, had signs of viral pneumonia in the lungs, doctors found — but no outward symptoms. Some scientists suspect that this is typical of coronavirus infection in children.

“It’s certainly true that children can be either asymptomatically infected or have very mild infection,” said Dr. Raina MacIntyre, an epidemiologist at the University of New South Wales in Sydney, Australia, who has been studying the spread of the new coronavirus.

In many ways, this pattern parallels that seen during outbreaks of SARS and MERS, also coronaviruses. The MERS epidemics in Saudi Arabia in 2012 and in South Korea in 2015 together claimed more than 800 lives. Most children who were infected never developed symptoms.

No children died during the SARS epidemic in 2003, and the majority of the 800 deaths in the outbreak were in people over age 45, with men more at risk.

Among the more than 8,000 cases of SARS, researchers at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention were able to identify 135 infected children in published reports.

Children under age 12 were much less likely to be admitted to a hospital or to need oxygen or other treatment, the researchers found. Children over age 12 had symptoms much like those of adults.

“We don’t fully understand the reason for this age-related increase of severity,” Dr. Peiris said. “But we see that now — and with SARS, you could see that much more clearly.”

It’s not unusual for viruses to trigger only mild infections in children and much more severe illnesses in adults. Chickenpox, for example, can be largely inconsequential in children, yet catastrophic in adults.

Influenza is unusual in that it has evolved with humans over thousands of years and infects millions worldwide each year. Still, even though thousands of young children end up in the hospital each year with influenza, just a small percentage of them die, Dr. Peiris noted.

 Adults may be more susceptible because they are more likely to have other diseases, such as diabetes, high blood pressure or heart disease, that weaken their ability to stave off infections.

The body’s innate immunity, which is critical for fighting viruses, also deteriorates with age, and particularly after middle age.

“Something happens at age 50,” Dr. MacIntyre said. “It declines, and it declines exponentially, which is why for most infections we see the highest incidence in the elderly.”

A key question about the new coronavirus is whether children who are infected and asymptomatic are able to pass the virus to others.

“We know that young people in general — not just kids, but young adults and teenagers — have the most intense contact in society,” Dr. MacIntyre said. Young people who don’t realize they are sick may contribute to the epidemic’s momentum, she said.

To understand the epidemic fully, she and other scientists said they need detailed data: when people were first exposed to the virus, when they first began to show symptoms, how many and which people have mild symptoms versus more severe disease.

With detailed data, some observations, such as the higher risk in men, may change. Still, Dr. Mark Denison, a pediatric infectious diseases specialist at Vanderbilt University in Nashville, said he does not expect to see a sudden uptick in infected children.

“It’s hard for me to imagine that there’s such a degree of underreporting of clinical illness in children that we’re only hearing about two or three cases,” he said.

“I think it means that there are many, many less children” who are infected in China, he said, “and that they’re not as much at risk.”"

Are you likely to die from coronavirus? No. But many people do not understand how viruses work. The corona virus has a 10 to 14 day incubation period, and for this virus in particular the person is infectious during this time... and doesn't even know they are sick. 

Viruses and their hosts evolve together over time. Viruses are obligate meaning they require a living host in order to survive themselves, it isn't in their best interest to kill their host. Think of the common cold. It's caused by viruses, but you probably aren't scared of dying when you have a cold. Ebola is a good example of why an unknown virus can be scary. Ebola made the leap to humans and because it hasn't had time to form that evolutionary relationship with us, it has potential to kill its host too quickly. 

""Coronavirus"" is a family of viruses, kind of like how a cold or influenza is a family of viruses. We've seen it before, this time its just a new strain, and appears to spread quickly. Like any illness it has potential to be a dangerous epidemic. Assuming you live in the US, its ""scary"" because it is an unknown and the media blows things up (granted that the possibility of a disease epidemic is news worthy). Realistically speaking, assuming you live in the US, you have nothing to be scared of."

That's not how a death rate works. You can't count someone who contracted the virus YESTERDAY as though they contracted it and survived.

There are currently 720 confirmed death and 2,084 confirmed recovered. That would equal a death rate of 25%. That number is also high, because it takes longer to be pronounced fully recovered from a disease than it takes to die from it.

Okay you definitely are just acting like you know what you are talking about, Marx never said global revolution all at once(as Trotsky believed) was necessary. Lenin was against Trotsky's Global Revolution because it was putting the carriage before the horse, in that after having barely survived a revolution and civil war, Trotsky thought the best course of action was to immediately, without hesitation, go to war with the entire fucking planet.


Needless to say Trotsky's Global Revolution was a bad idea just from a military/strategic perspective. Socialism in One Country is about building up Socialism in the country the revolution occured before attempting to take on the entire global capitalist hegemony. How many socialist Republics did Trotsky form? Because Lenin and Stalin are the very reason the Eastern Bloc existed in the first place. To say Stalin didn't export revolution is to deny that the eastern bloc even existed.

The INPEX Village at least has the positives of being owned b the NTG, vacant, the facilities are fairly new and presumably in good nick, and in a lower density population area. And not drastically far from RDH if someone does get sick.   

Also ignoring the fact that the people going into quarantine are not (necessarily) sick, or at least not sick with coronavirus. They are being screened before they get on the flight in China, accompanied and constantly monitored by health professionals during the flight, screened again when they get to Darwin, and accompanied and monitored and screened for the whole time they will be in quarantine. Yes there's some risk that someone among them *might* develop the virus, but there's also the ""risk"" that they will stay perfectly healthy and go on their way in a fortnight.  

And ignoring the fact this illness is passed by close contact (within one metre). Both Johnston and Zuccoli are well outside that distance. The breeze isn't going to blow coronavirus through the suburbs.

My criticism of this decision is that this has all happened stupidly fast as far as we can see. It means it has restricted the ability to do a full assessment of where the best quarantine facility might actually be. Maybe that actually might be the INPEX Village, but it doesn't seem like they've considered too many other options as far as we can tell."

A handful of posts which were politics-adjacent and have political implications, but dealing with things that aren't particularly right-wing (like the purported glyphosate-cancer connection; or the connection between the developer of the app for the Iowa caucus and the party).

Zhejiang province has adopted quarantine procedures similar to those in Hubei, for its major cities. As of two nights ago, Zhejiang had passed the mark of having 1000 confirmed cases of corona. Guangdong province had as well. According to Chinese media, as I understand it, Shenzhen is apparently under quarantine as well. Hong Kong is now imposing border restrictions.

https://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/health-environment/article/3049392/coronavirus-cross-border-commuters-reeling-hong

This puts the number of people under some kind of lockdown or restricted travel into the *9 digit range*. The number of explicitly quarantined (as in forbidden to leave homes, or restricted from moving about freely in other ways) now above 60 million.

The economic fallout and implications are still starting to dawn on people. The world's workshop is shutting down, and other countries will follow when they get hit bad like China has. Here's a story about iPhone factories now telling workers to not come in:

https://www.macrumors.com/2020/02/07/foxconn-tells-staff-keep-away-from-shenzen/

The virus development was paid for by the US department of defense at harvard.   the vaccine was stolen by the doctorate mentioned in the first link.  

Russia is blaming the US because they know this.  See link 4.  India is launching a probe into Wuhan’s virus lab.  See link 2.  Also, a reputable link from a mainstream publication, see link 3.

China is developing propaganda saying the weapon was developed in the US.  They’re not wrong.  

Still, 2019-nCov being released into the public is an accident.

The lab uses bats for virus studies.  Most likely a lab employee unintentionally carried a the virus out of the lab.   The media is leaving out the bioweapon detail at this time, because we have no cure, not enough tests, and nothing can be done until the country begins to see symptoms in the public.  

The FBI is disclosing Chinese espionage investigations this Tuesday.  See link 1.

Also, it’s true, blame is not as important right now as scientific research for the purpose of solving this problem.   Premature disclosure could potentially create hysteria and subsequent consequences.

https://www.caixinglobal.com/2020-02-06/reporters-notebook-we-interview-front-line-coronavirus-doctor-101512020.html


And, this study: First Case of 2019 Novel Coronavirus in the United States 

35 year old male - symptom progression day 1-12

https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2001191


On January 19, 2020, a 35-year-old man presented to an urgent care clinic in Snohomish County, Washington, with a 4-day history of cough and subjective fever. On checking into the clinic, the patient put on a mask in the waiting room. After waiting approximately 20 minutes, he was taken into an examination room and underwent evaluation by a provider. He disclosed that he had returned to Washington State on January 15 after traveling to visit family in Wuhan, China. The patient stated that he had seen a health alert from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) about the novel coronavirus outbreak in China and, because of his symptoms and recent travel, decided to see a health care provider....

Given the patient’s travel history, the local and state health departments were immediately notified. Together with the urgent care clinician, the Washington Department of Health notified the CDC Emergency Operations Center. Although the patient reported that he had not spent time at the Huanan seafood market and reported no known contact with ill persons during his travel to China, CDC staff concurred with the need to test the patient for 2019-nCoV on the basis of current CDC “persons under investigation” case definitions.8 Specimens were collected in accordance with CDC guidance and included serum and nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swab specimens. After specimen collection, the patient was discharged to home isolation with active monitoring by the local health department.
On January 20, 2020, the CDC confirmed that the patient’s nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabs tested positive for 2019-nCoV by real-time reverse-transcriptase–polymerase-chain-reaction (rRT-PCR) assay. In coordination with CDC subject-matter experts, state and local health officials, emergency medical services, and hospital leadership and staff, the patient was admitted to an airborne-isolation unit at Providence Regional Medical Center for clinical observation, with health care workers following CDC recommendations for contact, droplet, and airborne precautions with eye protection.

On admission, the patient reported persistent dry cough and a 2-day history of nausea and vomiting; he reported that he had no shortness of breath or chest pain. Vital signs were within normal ranges. On physical examination, the patient was found to have dry mucous membranes. The remainder of the examination was generally unremarkable. After admission, the patient received supportive care, including 2 liters of normal saline and ondansetron for nausea.


On days 2 through 5 of hospitalization (days 6 through 9 of illness), the patient’s vital signs remained largely stable, apart from the development of intermittent fevers accompanied by periods of tachycardia (Figure 2). The patient continued to report a nonproductive cough and appeared fatigued. On the afternoon of hospital day 2, the patient passed a loose bowel movement and reported abdominal discomfort. A second episode of loose stool was reported overnight; a sample of this stool was collected for rRT-PCR testing, along with additional respiratory specimens (nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal) and serum. The stool and both respiratory specimens later tested positive by rRT-PCR for 2019-nCoV, whereas the serum remained negative.

Treatment during this time was largely supportive. For symptom management, the patient received, as needed, antipyretic therapy consisting of 650 mg of acetaminophen every 4 hours and 600 mg of ibuprofen every 6 hours. He also received 600 mg of guaifenesin for his continued cough and approximately 6 liters of normal saline over the first 6 days of hospitalization.


A chest radiograph taken on hospital day 3 (illness day 7) was reported as showing no evidence of infiltrates or abnormalities (Figure 3). However, a second chest radiograph from the night of hospital day 5 (illness day 9) showed evidence of pneumonia in the lower lobe of the left lung (Figure 4). These radiographic findings coincided with a change in respiratory status starting on the evening of hospital day 5, when the patient’s oxygen saturation values as measured by pulse oximetry dropped to as low as 90% while he was breathing ambient air. On day 6, the patient was started on supplemental oxygen, delivered by nasal cannula at 2 liters per minute. Given the changing clinical presentation and concern about hospital-acquired pneumonia, treatment with vancomycin (a 1750-mg loading dose followed by 1 g administered intravenously every 8 hours) and cefepime (administered intravenously every 8 hours) was initiated.


On hospital day 6 (illness day 10), a fourth chest radiograph showed basilar streaky opacities in both lungs, a finding consistent with atypical pneumonia (Figure 5), and rales were noted in both lungs on auscultation. Given the radiographic findings, the decision to administer oxygen supplementation, the patient’s ongoing fevers, the persistent positive 2019-nCoV RNA at multiple sites, and published reports of the development of severe pneumonia3,4 at a period consistent with the development of radiographic pneumonia in this patient, clinicians pursued compassionate use of an investigational antiviral therapy. Treatment with intravenous remdesivir (a novel nucleotide analogue prodrug in development10,11) was initiated on the evening of day 7, and no adverse events were observed in association with the infusion. Vancomycin was discontinued on the evening of day 7, and cefepime was discontinued on the following day, after serial negative procalcitonin levels and negative nasal PCR testing for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus.

On hospital day 8 (illness day 12), the patient’s clinical condition improved. Supplemental oxygen was discontinued, and his oxygen saturation values improved to 94 to 96% while he was breathing ambient air. The previous bilateral lower-lobe rales were no longer present. His appetite improved, and he was asymptomatic aside from intermittent dry cough and rhinorrhea. 

As of January 30, 2020, the patient remains hospitalized. He is afebrile, and all symptoms have resolved with the exception of his cough, which is decreasing in severity."

Driving fast, guns, rare diseases, terrorist attacks etc. Why the media coverage of the Wuhan flu already has died down is beyond me. I've seen some crazy shit on Liveleak, but the current videos from Wuhan are by far the worst shit I've ever seen. I'm guessing that chinese government, the WHO and neighboring countries (Thailand, Japan and Hong Kong)  are lying to keep the people calm. When people begin to panic, they start hording essential items and looting, making the disease much harder to control. It's also in everyone's economic interest to keep quiet, so markets don't tank. 

Very few cases have been reported outside of China, so most people in the public are not too worried. I think the media companies understand how dangerous the situtation could get, if mass panic broke out and they are purposly downplaying the coronavirus for as long as possible. It would also be dangerous for their staff members to report from the ground in China. The Hong Kong protests got tons more coverage since it was a lot safer to report on. I think the combination of public safety and their own staff safety, is preventing them from covering the coronavirus properly. I also don't think we can underestimate the average westerners lack of interest for what is going in China.  

The danger right now, is that there is a undetected cluster outside of China. If over 100 people got sick outside of China, not having previously visited China, it would cause full mayham. The public would begin to panic, the WHO would declare the virus a pandemic and the media would start reporting. 

The average persons interest in the cronavirus, can be meassured using the stockmarket. Look at how many shares of APT (Alpha Pro Tech) is being traded each day. 2 weeks ago 26 million shares were traded. Last week 33 million shares, and this week only 11 millions shares. The interest for the virus was at it's lowest this Wednesday but has picked up some steam this Thursday and Friday. If China doesn't go back to normal on Monday, I think the media will start to pay attention. That's just my 2 cents on the issue."

And yes, I file paperwork with the bergen county department of health, but I also compile reports and order supplies for the county and administer vaccines and help out as a medical assistant at county clinics. Have you’ve gotten any real world experience pertaining to your major????

So yeah, I’m not saying we can’t worry about it but it’s really not as severe as it will ever be as China. The amount of panic within the general public is an overreaction but should be no reason for racism.  

Furthermore, Dr. Nancy Messonnier, Director of CDC’s National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases did release a statement about the coronavirus and said that we shouldn’t be worried enough for it to affect our everyday actions. The CDC and NJ agencies have reassured local health departments and hospital workers that the risk is relatively low but we should be on the lookout for any flu patients who’ve traveled out of the country. On the bright side, the overreaction should mean people will wash their hands more often because the flu is a bitch this year. 

The government is prepared for the outbreak, I would know because I helped order N95s and gloves. So yeah, I don’t think I’m better than the CDC but I’m pretty sure when these government agencies say that the risk is low and there is no need to panic, *there is no need to panic.*

Edit: furthermore, my coworkers were the ones who transported a possible coronavirus patient to HackensackUMC. They used proper PPE and they weren’t worried. Even if we do contract it, it’s unlikely to be fatal since we’re all in perfectly good health. We’re more likely to get the flu since we’re in contact to that more."

Posted in another thread, but:
January 24th was the first time China reported more than 1000 confirmed cases. That means most of the 17,000 cases are 2 weeks old or less. Given that, it's not surprising only 2% of the cases have resulted in death so far. Keep in mind that there are currently 4k cases listed as serious or Critial (800 of the 4k) in Hubei province right now.

From doctor reports we're seen, symptoms get progressively worse for 2 weeks, and then the 3rd week determines if the person's immune system will fight off the virus or if they'll succumb to it. It's a bit early to make these sorts of announcements unless your goal is to just quell panic."

On 23 January 2020, the central government of the People's Republic of China imposed a lockdown in Wuhan and other cities in Hubei in an effort to quarantine the epicentre of a newly discovered coronavirus (2019-nCoV) to prevent an epidemic. This was the first known instance in modern history of locking down a major city of 11 million people and the incident was commonly referred to as the ""Wuhan Lockdown"" (Chinese: 武汉封城; pinyin: Wǔhàn fēng chéng) in the media. The World Health Organization (WHO), although stating that it was beyond its own guidelines, commended the move, calling it ""unprecedented in public health history"". The lockdown in Wuhan set the precedence for similar measures in other Chinese cities.

https://www.who.int/news-room/q-a-detail/q-a-coronaviruses


> **How long is the incubation period?**

> The incubation period is the time between infection and the onset of clinical symptoms of disease. Current estimates of the incubation period range from 1-12.5 days with median estimates of 5-6 days. These estimates will be refined as more data become available. Based on information from other coronavirus diseases, such as MERS and SARS, the incubation period of 2019-nCoV could be up to 14 days. WHO recommends that the follow-up of contacts of confirmed cases is 14 days.

> **Can 2019-nCoV be caught from a person who presents no symptoms?**

> Understanding the time when infected patients may spread the virus to others is critical for control efforts. Detailed medical information from people infected is needed to determine the infectious period of 2019-nCoV. According to recent reports, it may be possible that people infected with 2019-nCoV may be infectious before showing significant symptoms. However, based on currently available data, the people who have symptoms are causing the majority of virus spread.  

> **How long does the virus survive on surfaces?**

> It is still not known how long the 2019-nCoV virus survives on surfaces, although preliminary information suggests the virus may survive a few hours. Simple disinfectants can kill the virus making it no longer possible to infect people. 

> **How does this virus spread?**

> The new coronavirus is a respiratory virus which spreads primarily through contact with an infected person through respiratory droplets generated when a person, for example, coughs or sneezes, or through droplets of saliva or discharge from the nose. It is important that everyone practice good respiratory hygiene. For example, sneeze or cough into a flexed elbow, or use a tissue and discard it immediately into a closed bin.  It is also very important for people to wash their hands regularly with either alcohol-based hand rub or soap and water."

However, from the beginning on the market was suspected because of the animals kept there, not because of the people. It was never snakes (period). The virus was in bats a few years ago, but between bats and humans it had very likely found an intermediate host. 

The thing that is not legit here is the media cycle, which sensationalizes these scientific reports or even pre-prints; in research circles these things were quite clear. 

If you are still wondering why, here's my explanation below:

Why snakes were never an option: The researchers determined snakes by looking for codon usage and finding that these viruses were best codon-optimized to snakes; however this analysis is extremely flawed for viruses since most viruses are not codon adapted to that level to their hosts, therefore it is not possible to infer the host animal by this, and viruses have other restrictions for codon usage. Coronavirus genomes have a high A/U content, which coincides with snake genomes, however most coronaviruses circulate in mammals.

Now, why are bats often mentioned? That's because the closest related virus currently found (97 % genome identity, ~1000 bases difference) is found in bats. One researcher performed an analysis of these sequences for the public and determined the divergence of these viruses (i.e. the jump from bats to another intermediate animal) to be around 70 years ago: https://twitter.com/trvrb/status/1224207086013149184

So yes, the virus originally came likely from bats, but it jumped into an intermediate host a few years ago. Now, into which host it jumped is not yet clear. But, it is crucial to find this host to be able to limit reinfection and reemergence of the virus, that's why researchers are working on this so hard and news reports are coming out. 

I hope I could clear that up a little bit."

It has not been proven in recent studies on vaping that vaping causes the same suppression of cilia that traditional smoking does.  Studies have shown that certain flavorings may impact function of cilia, but nothing concrete relating to vaping in general.

The information about the virus mainly binding to ACE-2 receptors should be looked at with a skeptical eye.  The papers citing this are comparing the virus to SARS was found to bind to the ACE-2 receptors, but those receptors are  deep in the alveoli of the lungs.  Due to the rate of spread and suspected spread via asymptomatic people, this virus is likely to also bind to sialic acid (SA) which are found higher up in the respiratory tract and even in the eyes (case of a doctor getting the virus in his eye first supports this).  Flu and common colds often bind to SA which allows these viruses to quickly spread from early on in infected persons because only a light cough or even just breathing would disperse the virus from the upper respiratory tract into the surrounding air.

The regeant for each test cost US$73,000 ish, that's around 1billion rupiah, which is the price of a small house in small cities; our health ministry said it's costly for us and we have to test suspected case twice. Hence the evacuees are not tested unless they show symptoms (only if they have fever, temp check twice a day) within these 14 days. 

Not only that, only Jakarta is able to conduct the lab test, so cases in other cities take min 5 days before they can confirm it. We had around 10 suspected cases in the past, but most hospitals only looked for pneumonia signs. If the xray came back clear, they would discharge suspected case and gave them cough and fever meds. They also don't like media using the term ""suspected case"", which I don't really understand why, but since then there's been so little news about suspected case. 

I read with previous suspected cases, they were mostly China nationals or people coming back from China, some even came from Wuhan directly. They came down to the hospital with fever and cough, yet the hospital only said ""they were under observation and did not show any clinical signs of coronavirus"". Like the case in my city, they did chest xray and saw no pneumonia so they discharge him without any test.

Influenza is one family of virus, while coronavirus is a different family of viruses. This one belongs to the latter, hence the name. It's novel because this hasn't spread in humans before. Coronsviruses cause respitory infections in humans, whereas the flu typically has milder symptoms. The flu is also endemic to humans, meaning it's widespread throughout the human population, so we're better equipped to fight them, biologically and through medical intervention"

The map above is on the CDC website, on a page that says it was last updated in 2017.  https://www.cdc.gov/quarantine/quarantine-stations-us.html

I was happy when the first plane was supposed to go to Alaska, then confused and alarmed when I heard it would then immediately continue on into the lower 48.  Wth would they do that?  And presently the numbers of evacuees coming to us from China are small enough (still, what, 1,000 total?) that it would seem feasible to house them all in one location:  maybe in one big isolated spot.  Instead, they are being spread out all over the fucking country.  Does that make any kind of sense?  Why expose so many staff and other people to those evacuees?  Why not have **ONE** quarantine base?  It would be challenging to get it large enough and up and running quickly, but, surely not more challenging than getting several such places up and running quickly, right?

Theory/speculation:  the reason we are seeing them spread all around, from California, to Nebraska, and now Texas, etc., is that this is one step towards having each of those locations become a quarantine zone for US citizens who become infected later, through H2H and asymptomatic transmission.

EDIT:  Meant to post some more news on this - maybe it's been shared here already, I just haven't seen it getting much attention.  

1. Some 250 evacuees sent to Texas Friday (Feb 7 I think?) https://www.sacurrent.com/the-daily/archives/2020/02/07/cdc-coronavirus-evacuees-reportedly-arriving-at-san-antonios-lackland-afb-beginning-friday

If some other country like Germany started it, we would know the statistics about how many people are infected. However, China isn't being transparent. They claimed only a few thousand in the first week, but they were building a quarantine hospital in a week. You don't do that for a few thousand people. Also, it is a disease that can mutate fast, meaning that it could develop to be more dangerous. There is also no definite incubation time, meaning that it is inpossible to know when you'll get it. However, the worst thing is that it is infectious even if you don't have symptoms, meaning that it is theoretically impossible to stop the spread on a case by case basis. Some people don't show symptoms at all, meaning that they could spread it to everyone. My mother is an epidemiologist (look it up) who has been working right days straight on this, and we're in Australia. It has the potential to be a big deal

Wuhan is home to many manufacturers of optical components, crucial to telecommunication networks; the area where many of these companies are based is known as “Optics Valley.” They include the Wuhan-based fiber-optic giant Yangzte Optical Fibre and Cable Co., Accelink Technologies Co. and FiberHome Telecommunication Technologies Co.

The components are so critical that supply disruptions could lead to delays in the rollout of China’s forthcoming 5G telecommunication networks

The virus outbreak’s effects also are rippling through the automotive industry, with several auto makers extending factory shutdowns.

Wuhan also is home to Dongfeng Motor Corp., one of China’s biggest state-owned auto makers. It and its joint ventures with foreign car makers have many plants in the area.

Honda Motor said its three joint-venture factories with Dongfeng wouldn’t reopen until Feb. 14 at the earliest

1. The german patient zero was infected, became symptomatic, then got better, then got tested. And it's still in that state 11 days after. That goes for the other three cases found that day, the 28th, too. [Timeline](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMc2001468) The index patient, chinese woman, was symptomatic but medicated when the infection event happened.
2. We have medical data from the doctors in Wuhan with hundreds of cases.

Two issues -

1. We don't know of any pre-existing conditions he may have had. Co-morbidity.

2. We don't know to what degree, if any, his *reported* death has to do with the actual coronavirus.

I've read studies in the literature that (and this is early, so always a bit of grain of salt) show morbidity for this strain of coronavirus to be around 1%. If we go from reported cases/reported deaths, (roughly 30,000/600 respectively), it puts it around 2%. Almost all deaths (viral pneumonia, essentially) are because of age and/or co-morbidity.

This is in keeping with annual flu death percentages in mainland China, from the literature."

Professor Zhengli Shi, the Senior Scientist at the Wuhan institute of Virology, has received over $1M funding from the US Department of Defense, The US Defense Threat Reduction Agency & the US Biological Defense Research Directorate of the Naval Medical Research Centre, for her research on Coronaviruses and more specifically Bat Coronaviruses.

The virus has a limited lifespan outside of a host.

Initial recommendations were that the virus could not live in open air for more than 5 days, BUT I saw a study reported today (should be posted in this sub) that raises that recommendation to 9 days.

You don't necessarily need to throw your package away, but I would definitely quarantine it for two weeks.   Wrap it in a trash bag and don't open it for two weeks ...

If a virus on a package was a prevalent form of transmission, then we would see Coronavirus popping up in random locations that could not be tracked back to actual humans traveling to/from Wuhan.

Basically the non-infected risk factors are age, smoking, and low anti body counts.

If you were a former or current smoker you have more Ace-2 in your lungs. This ace-2 is what the Wuhan CoronaVirus attacks. This being said, children do have higher chances of beating off viral pneumonia then adults. As long as there are not pre-existing conditions such as hypertension or low white blood cell counts. Parents who smoke around their children increase the risk of that child having complications. As smoke increases ace-2 production in the lungs.

It noted that just being a person with a past history of tobacco use raised mortality/severity by 10% and being a current smoker raised risk of severity/mortality by about 30%

Seeing as how the coronavirus appears to cause pneumonia in severe cases, being a smoker would raise the risk of severity/mortality in the event the patient got a severe case and developed pneumonia.

As a former smoker (2 years quit now after 25 years), I can encourage any current smokers to quit - just do it. If I had only known how easy it really was to walk away from that addiction forever, I would have done it so much earlier.

Sun Chunlan, a vice premier tasked with leading the central government’s response to the outbreak that is centered in Wuhan, said city investigators should go to each home to check the temperatures of every resident and interview infected patients’ close contacts.

“Set up a 24-hour duty system. During these wartime conditions, there must be no deserters, or they will be nailed to the pillar of historical shame forever,” Ms. Sun said.

The city’s authorities have raced to meet these instructions by setting up makeshift mass quarantine shelters this week.

Forty health care workers were infected with the novel coronavirus by patients at a single Wuhan hospital in January, a new study has found, underscoring the risks to those at the frontlines of the growing epidemic.

One patient who was admitted to the surgical department was presumed to have infected 10 health care workers, according to the paper that was authored by doctors at the Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University and published in the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA) on Friday.
Seventeen patients who were hospitalized for other reasons also became infected by the coronavirus. A total of 138 patients got the virus in a period spanning January 1 to January 28, with hospital-associated transmission accounting for 41 percent of all cases.

The study comes just hours after a Chinese doctor who was punished for raising the alarm about the coronavirus died from the pathogen -- sparking an outpouring of grief and anger over a worsening crisis that has now killed more than 630 people.

Of the 40 infected health care workers in the JAMA study, 31 worked on general wards, seven in the emergency
 department, and two in the ICU.The example of the patient presumed to have infected 10 health workers highlighted the high level of danger within hospitals during the first phase of the epidemic, even though overall it is currently estimated that each patient infects on average 2.2 others.
""If true, then this confirms that some patients are likely to be far more infectious than others, and this poses further difficulties in managing their cases,"" said Michael Head, a global health expert at the University of Southampton said in a comment to the UK's Science Media Centre."

On 23 January 2020, the central government of the People's Republic of China imposed a lockdown in Wuhan and other cities in Hubei in an effort to quarantine the epicentre of a newly discovered coronavirus (2019-nCoV) to prevent an epidemic. This was the first known instance in modern history of locking down a major city of 11 million people and the incident was commonly referred to as the ""Wuhan Lockdown"" (Chinese: 武汉封城; pinyin: Wǔhàn fēng chéng) in the media. The World Health Organization (WHO), although stating that it was beyond its own guidelines, commended the move, calling it ""unprecedented in public health history"". The lockdown in Wuhan set the precedence for similar measures in other Chinese cities.

Isn’t it too late to get a flu shot, considering that it takes about a month for an immune system to produce antibodies , by that time it will be middle of March and flu epidemic will subside? Will it compromise the immune system for those who can potentially get infected with coronavirus?  If there is no treatment for coronavirus, is there a better chance to fight it off with active immunotherapy with ascorbic acid, sodium deoxyribonucleate, azoximer bromide and etc.  Also if those who do not have an access to immunomodulators what people can buy and use to help their immune system.

They've also confirmed that the virus can be spread while people are asymptomatic.

There are a lot of signs pointing to this being much worse than the chinese are reporting and that thats why they're quarantining entire cities with millions of people.

If it gets really bad and chinas economy continues to slow because of the quarantines it could have global financial effects.

For us outside of china, in developed countries there are effective quarantine procedures and medical facilities that reduce the ability of the virus to spread.  Its already here in the US though

https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/cases-in-us.html

We're just kept relatively safe because we have advanced medical facilities and limited numbers of infected so our resources aren't overwhelmed like Chinas.  If it spreads as an epidemic to other large countries with poor healthcare like indonesia, pakistan and india it could get really bad.

This virus is definitely going to be much worse than sars.  Its sars with much more dangerous characteristics for spread in a country that let an outbreak spread for weeks before seriously reacting.  This one might be the super sars that they've been worrying about since sars classic.

One positive is that it might be possible to get bipartisan support for funding for the cdc.  Also might get china to ban wildlife trading markets.  I suppose a global economic slowdown might also be good for reducing carbon emissions.

How did you find out your cat has FIP? If you mean feline infectious peritonitis, there is no real test for that. And there is no reliable test to see if your cat chronically carries feline coronavirus, which is what gives cats FIP. Almost half of all cats carry FCoV at some point in their lives and never show symptoms. Plus, if your cat really does have FIP, it has a >95% fatality rate. The longest a cat is expected to live with FIP is up to a couple months if it has the ""dry"" form (which is the less common).

Basically, I don't understand how your cat could be living multiple years with FIP. And if the vet meant FCoV, that is such a common virus for cats to have that it would be crazy to never spay/neuter a cat that carries it for fear the stress of the surgery will trigger an advancement to FIP.

If FIP is referencing a different condition, then disregard this entire reply."

Q: Am I at risk for novel coronavirus from a package or products shipping from China?

There is still a lot that is unknown about the newly emerged 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) and how it spreads. Two other coronaviruses have emerged previously to cause severe illness in people (MERS and SARS). 2019-nCoV is more genetically related to SARS than MERS, but both are betacoronaviruses with their origins in bats. While we don’t know for sure that this virus will behave the same way as SARS and MERS, we can use the information from both of these earlier coronaviruses to guide us. In general, because of poor survivability of these coronaviruses on surfaces, there is likely very low risk of spread from products or packaging that are shipped over a period of days or weeks at ambient temperatures. Coronaviruses are generally thought to be spread most often by respiratory droplets. Currently there is no evidence to support transmission of 2019-nCoV associated with imported goods and there have not been any cases of 2019-nCoV in the United States associated with imported goods. Information will be provided on the 2019 Novel Coronavirus website as it becomes available."

The pneumococcal vaccines are providing you with protection from common bacteria that cause pneumonia. Pneumonia is caused by inflammation from either a bacteria or viruse invalder. You see, the lower respiratory tract is normally totally sterile. The invader causes irritation and damage through inflammation. Inflammation also causes fluid accumulation throw relaxation of blood vessels so the immune cells can get to the area. This app makes it hard to breath. Your lungs can actually fail and you need to be put on a ventilator. This is how people die from major viruses like influenza or coronavirus. 
Bacteria can also get stuck in hour lower lungs if you aspiration food or drink. This is a big problem for stroke and dementia patients.  Bacteria can also get stuck in mucus (caused by things like cold or flu) and travel down to the lower respiratory track overnight. If you smoke you also have a hard time moving up mucus out of your chest. 
Old age (65 and older) means your ability to keep your airways clear is reduced and you’re at a higher risk of bacteria pneumonia.  So the vaccines cover you against some of the bacteria that can cause pneumonia. 
Younger patients can have this too (spleen removal or immunocompromised from things like cancer)  and they are recommended to get the vaccine. 
Basically, long story short, if you’re young and health your risk of bacteria pneumonia is very low. And the coverage from the vaccine doesn’t last long because your body “forgets” what the bacteria look like. So you would have to be revaccinated every 5-10 years for a very low risk thing that you can fight off on your own if you get it.

Wuhan police “letter of reprimand” to Li Wenliang: translation and analysis
February 6, 2020 Donald Clarke Leave a comment

Li Wenliang is the doctor who first began spreading word of the coronavirus outbreak in Wuhan (through a WeChat group) and was punished by the authorities for doing so, first with detention from Jan. 1 to Jan. 3, and then with a “letter of reprimand” upon his release. I found the letter quite interesting and offer a translation here along with some comments. Incidentally, two points about Li. First, he became infected himself and his death was recently reported, but those reports have now been withdrawn, and as of 2:49 pm EST on Feb. 6, 2020, it’s being reported that he is alive but in critical condition. Second, although Li is commonly referred to as a whistle-blower, that may not be completely accurate. The group to which he reported the news was a group of fellow university classmates (Class of ’04 — meaning they entered in 2004 — in clinical medicine at Wuhan University). But according to a sympathetic account (of which more at the end of this post), in his messages, he instructed them not to spread the news beyond the group (“不要外传”).

Now for the letter. Here’s my translation:This is an odd document for a couple of reasons — so much so that I first wondered if it might be fake, but I then discovered that Li had presented the document himself to Caixin. But look at the language: instead of the usual formal style of official documents, we have exclamation marks in what reads more like a transcript of a police officer barking at a suspect: “听明白了吗? Have you got that?” The document is suffused with the language of offended Authority scolding a wayward and insufficiently obedient subject.

The other odd thing about it is that this kind of document doesn’t appear to have any basis in the law it cites, the Security Administration Punishment Law. That law provides for the possibility of a “warning” (警告), but says nothing about “reprimands” (训诫). As usual, the police appear to be just making it up as they go along.

The “sympathetic account” I referred to above is a document that looks like a legal complaint (although I don’t think it has actually been filed in any Chinese court yet, and probably won’t get docketed if it is filed) written by disbarred lawyer Cheng Hai. It’s filed on behalf of Li and other persecuted by the Wuhan police, and asserts that their detention and the reprimand letter were unlawful. It specifically names as defendants (among others) the “Reprimanders” who signed Li’s Notice of Reprimand: Hu Guifang (“cassia fragrance”; did a hammer of the dictatorship of the proletariat ever have a lovelier name?) and Xu Jinhang."

> People may be wary of crowded places due to the coronavirus outbreak, but that is not stopping punters from trying their luck at a $12 million prize pool.

> Long queues were seen around Singapore Pools outlets throughout the day for this year's Toto Hong Bao Draw.

> Each of the four outlets visited by The New Paper yesterday had more than 30 people in the queue, with the line at the Toa Payoh FairPrice outlet reaching around 50 people.

> A punter, who declined to be named, said he would be placing a $5 bet as he joined the queue at FairPrice.

> The Housing Board employee, 64, said: ""From what I read on the news, I'm not too scared and I'm not avoiding crowds. Life goes on as normal.""

> At Bishan, a beautician with the Jean Yip group joined a 30-person queue while wearing a mask.

> She said: ""I am fine queueing as long as the place is safe and I have a mask. But I wouldn't buy 4D from a place with actual cases.""

> Another hopeful punter at Bishan said the virus outbreak has affected his paper carrier manufacturing business. However, he was not placing bets in hope of recovering his losses.

> He said: ""I am just placing bets like I normally do to have a shot at an early retirement.""

> The $12 million jackpot will be drawn today at 9.30pm at the Singapore Pools Building.

> News of Li&#039;s death became the top top-read topic on China&#039;s microblogging site Weibo overnight on Friday, with over 1.5 billion views, and was also heavily discussed in private WeChat messaging groups, where people expressed outrage and sadness.

> The topics &quot;The Wuhan government owes doctor Li Wenliang an apology&quot; and &quot;We want free speech&quot; briefly trended on Weibo late on Thursday, but yielded no search results on Friday.

> Sarah Cook, a senior research analyst and China Media Bulletin Director at Freedom House, said the public outcry over Li looked &quot;Widespread and unified&quot;, but it still unclear how big a turning point it could be, given that other national tragedies like a 2008 high-speed rail crash had incurred similar public reaction that later petered off.

[Clinical features of patients infected with 2019 novel coronavirus in Wuhan, China (n=41)](https://doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(20)30183-5)

>However, few patients with 2019-nCoV infection had prominent upper respiratory tract signs and symptoms (eg, rhinorrhoea, sneezing, or sore throat), indicating that the target cells might be located in the lower airway.

[Epidemiological and clinical characteristics of 99 cases of 2019 novel coronavirus pneumonia in Wuhan, China: a descriptive study (n=99)](https://doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(20)30211-7)

>Of the 99 patients with 2019-nCoV pneumonia, 49 (49%) had a history of exposure to the Huanan seafood market. The average age of the patients was 55·5 years (SD 13·1), including 67 men and 32 women. 2019-nCoV was detected in all patients by real-time RT-PCR. 50 (51%) patients had chronic diseases. Patients had clinical manifestations of fever (82 [83%] patients), cough (81 [82%] patients), shortness of breath (31 [31%] patients), muscle ache (11 [11%] patients), confusion (nine [9%] patients), headache (eight [8%] patients), sore throat (five [5%] patients), rhinorrhoea (four [4%] patients), chest pain (two [2%] patients), diarrhoea (two [2%] patients), and nausea and vomiting (one [1%] patient). According to imaging examination, 74 (75%) patients showed bilateral pneumonia, 14 (14%) patients showed multiple mottling and ground-glass opacity, and one (1%) patient had pneumothorax. 17 (17%) patients developed acute respiratory distress syndrome and, among them, 11 (11%) patients worsened in a short period of time and died of multiple organ failures

Of 99 patients, 4 had rhinorrhea and 5 had sore throat. Note: The paper however didn't point out how many had rhinorrhea and sore throat and we shouldn't assume that it sums up to 9 cases of 99 patients in total.

*few patients with 2019-nCoV infection had prominent upper respiratory tract signs and symptoms*. My personal interpretation of this result tells me that if you only have upper respiratory symptoms, you're more likely to catch a common cold etc instead of the virus (not a very scientific one just to note).

As to why the government insist on telling everyone to only wear mask if you're sick, I personally feel that it all comes down to reducing panic. I personally feel that the main problem of this outbreak is not the virus making people sick but rather the panic that it is causing. 5.7m population (latest SingStats) would mean 171m masks a month. If the government tells it's citizen to wear mask which the scientific community says is not really effective, you're going to end up with unnecessary panic. And besides where are you suppose to get 171m a month when everyone worldwide is trying to snatch a few for themselves.

Remember that resources are finite. We need to optimize how we're going to use them. Otherwise we'll not have the resources for when it truly matters."

> SINGAPORE - Politicians and supermarket chain representatives on Friday (Feb 7) called shoppers to remain calm, saying Singapore has sufficient stocks of essential supplies and food.

> This was after items began flying off shelves at some supermarkets here when Singapore announced earlier in the day that it will be ramping up its disease outbreak response to the coronavirus situation by a notch to Orange, which is just below the highest level of Red.

> Many photos and posts circulating on social media showed long queues at supermarkets and empty shelves.

> Minister for Trade and Industry Chan Chun Sing in a Facebook post gave his assurance that Singapore’s supply lines for essential supplies like rice and instant noodles are intact.

> “There is no risk of us running a shortage of essential food or household items. We also have our national stockpile for essential items,” said Mr Chan, adding that his ministry is in close contact with retailers here.

> Under the Disease Outbreak Response System Condition or Dorscon, Orange means the outbreak is deemed to have moderate to high public health impact.

> The Government’s announcement of moving its disease outbreak response up a level to Orange came even as three more Singaporeans were confirmed to be infected with the coronavirus originating from China’s Wuhan city, and did not have any links to previous cases or travel history to China.

> Representatives from supermarkets also assured that Singapore has enough stocks of food and groceries, and urged shoppers to exercise restraint.

> Mr Seah Kian Peng, chief executive of supermarket chain FairPrice, said there was a surge and some panic buying of food and groceries at its physical and online stores, resulting in some shelves to be empty as a result.

> But he urged people to remain calm as stocks are being replenished.

> Mr Seah said: “We have stocks and they are being replenished from our warehouse but if everyone starts to buy a lot more than what they need, there will never be enough. Hence I hope we all stay calm and not get into this mode and behaviour.""

> FairPrice has also stepped up the cleaning regime for all its stores, made available hand sanitisers for customers to use in-store, and put in place twice daily temperature screening for all staff. Masks were distributed to staff for their use should they feel unwell.

> Related Story Coronavirus: Get latest updates

> Related Story Coronavirus: 3 new Singapore cases include Victoria JC teacher

> A spokesman for Sheng Siong, another supermarket chain, also called on shoppers to avoid over buying.

> “Currently, we have sufficient inventory in Singapore for food supplies and toiletries to meet customers’ usual daily needs,” she said “Customers do not need to over purchase on groceries and necessities. Our sources of supply are well-diversified and we will continue to work closely with our suppliers.

> Meanwhile, a Singapore Food Agency (SFA) spokesman told The Straits Times that Singapore does not import livestock or raw meat from China.

> But as there is no evidence that infections of the novel coronavirus are associated with the consumption of food, no restrictions have been imposed on food imports from China, she said.

> Still, in the event of any food supply disruptions caused by the outbreak, Singapore’s food supply is unlikely to be affected, as Singapore imports its food from more than 170 countries.

> While fresh food items such as vegetables and fruits and fish are imported from China, the country is not the Republic’s only source, said the SFA spokesman.

> Such food items also come from other countries, such as Malaysia, Indonesia, Vietnam, Thailand, the United States, Australia, and South Africa.

> “Diversification has always been one of our key strategies to ensure a secure supply of safe food,” said the SFA spokesman.

> “Our importers are ready to tap on other available sources should there be a disruption of food supply to minimise the overall impact on our food supply.”

It has impacted 4 sectors I know of already. Assembly factories for things like the Nintendo Switch and other electronics got closed down. Software development studios for porting software got delayed. Consumption of oil has dropped 20% in China due to lots of factories standing still. Export and transportation of electronic parts have also significantly reduced due to logistical problems.

This will have long-term consequences as companies are looking elsewhere to get their parts produced and assembly done. It's likely that these customers will build new supply lines and relations and won't return to China in the future.

2020-02-07,scooterdog,China_Flu,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/China_Flu/comments/f088vt/novel_coronavirus_3_new_patients_in_singapore/fgs72t8/,"You are correct in that the incubation period is up to two weeks, thus the need for two weeks quarantine time.

[This paper in the NEJM](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2001316) published last week analyzed the first 425 confirmed cases in Wuhan, and measured an average incubation time of 5.2 days and an r0 ('basic reproductive number') of 2.2.

And to alleviate worry (source: am in the US and as I am in the DC area, know personally many people at NIAID and other NGOs heavily involved in infectious disease) here's some info from the WHO to the public, published on their [daily situation report that can be found here](https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/situation-reports/).

>RECOMMENDATIONS AND ADVICE FOR THE PUBLIC   
>  
>During previous outbreaks due to other coronavirus (Middle-East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), human-to-human transmission occurred through droplets, contact and fomites, suggesting that the transmission mode of the 2019-nCoV can be similar. The basic principles to reduce the general risk of transmission of acute respiratory infections include the following:   
>  
>• Avoiding close contact with people suffering from acute respiratory infections.   
>  
>• Frequent hand-washing, especially after direct contact with ill people or their environment.   
>  
>• Avoiding unprotected contact with farm or wild animals.   
>  
>• People with symptoms of acute respiratory infection should practice cough etiquette (maintain distance, cover coughs and sneezes with disposable tissues or clothing, and wash hands).   
>  
>• Within healthcare facilities, enhance standard infection prevention and control practices in hospitals, especially in emergency departments. 

As I have close relatives in China, I am worried too. The people I talk with were planning on a pandemic, per the [Director of NIAID Dr. Fauci said in the NY Times only last week](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/02/health/coronavirus-pandemic-china.html). 

[Yet only two days ago on CNBC Dr. Fauci said](https://www.cnbc.com/video/2020/02/03/good-public-health-has-limited-outbreak-in-the-us-dr-fauci.html) casual contact may not be as infectious as previously believed. Of the 11 in the US, only 2 were never in China. Sustained transmission hasn't occurred (yet) 'because of good public health measures'. And 'as the entry of potentially infectious people is restricted you see the dampening down of that'.

The video is worth a watch - believe me a TON of surveillance is going on in the US now, as the CDC released an Emergency Use Authorization for a relatively simple diagnostic test, which the FDA released only a day later (IIRC it was Tuesday) and [Scott Gottlieb (Former FDA commissioner) wrote](https://www.wsj.com/articles/act-now-to-prevent-an-american-epidemic-11580255335) that everyone in the US with pneumonia now should be tested for 2019-nCoV.

Two 'early warning' systems I myself am keeping an eye on are new cases - both from the WHO Situation Report ([linked above](https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/situation-reports/)) that has charts by country with new cases on a daily basis, as well as [this Johns Hopkins dashboard here](https://gisanddata.maps.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html#/bda7594740fd40299423467b48e9ecf6) (alas does not have trend data on a country-by-country basis but is a nice overview)."

This aspect provides the possibility for this newly introduced zoonotic viral pathogen to adapt to become more efficiently transmitted from person to person and possibly become more virulent.

This entire work scares the shit out of me.

Your second point is completely incorrect, the Coronavirus is very very very very very dangerous, there is no cure in the US as of the day this was posted, and can cause imminent damage to the immune system and high fever.

It goes something like: the more security you have in your life, the more bars you put around yourself. This is why the deepest part of prison is called maximum security.

We make our own cages. We shouldn't. We need to live our lives, and die doing it. I don't mean we should jump out of planes without parachutes, but we should follow what the vikings did and set ourselves up for the sky to our place in the stars, rather than look down at the ground where our grave will be.

I think if a man is going to be in front of the computer, they should be spending their time learning how to make money, how to travel, how to live out their dreams, and pretty much learn all they can about stuff that matters to them. We should focus on our spiritual sides, we should take care of our health, and we should especially take care of our mental health.

Our caveman ancestors didn't arm wrestle with dinosaurs just so we can become fat lazy potatoes with man tits. We should be doing things with our lives, but we don't. Instead of creating memories, we sew regrets into a security blanket.

Hong Kong has had 24 cases of the virus, and one of only two deaths outside mainland China where almost 640 people have died in the outbreak.

“Everyone’s snatching whatever they can get. I don’t even know what’s going on,” said a 72-year-old woman surnamed Li as she clutched two bags of toilet roll.

Shoppers have been clearing supermarket shelves of staples like rice and meat as well as cleaning products such as soap.

The argument is just stupid. It is non-sequitur -- number of flu deaths is completely irrelevant when discussing a new threat. So a person using this argument is just not thinking clearly.

If you want to argue with them, you can say that if the new coronavirus infects as many people as flu, 40 times more people might die.

https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/to-your-health/wp/2018/02/01/cdc-to-cut-by-80-percent-efforts-to-prevent-global-disease-outbreak/

Countries where the CDC is planning to scale back include some of the world’s hot spots for emerging infectious disease, such as China, Pakistan, Haiti, Rwanda and Congo. 

Global health organizations said critical momentum will be lost if epidemic prevention funding is reduced, leaving the world unprepared for the next outbreak. The risks of deadly and costly pandemic threats are higher than ever, especially in low- and middle-income countries with the weakest public health systems, experts say. A rapid response by a country can mean the difference between an isolated outbreak and a global catastrophe. In less than 36 hours, infectious disease and pathogens can travel from a remote village to major cities on any continent to become a global crisis.

2020:

http://theconversation.com/the-trump-administration-has-made-the-us-less-ready-for-infectious-disease-outbreaks-like-coronavirus-130983

For fiscal year 2020, Trump proposed cutting the CDC budget by US$1.3 billion, nearly 20% below the 2019 level.

Congress reinstated most of this funding, with bipartisan support. But the overall level of appropriations for relevant CDC programs is still 10% below what the U.S. spent in 2016, adjusting for inflation.

President Trump recently signed a $738 billion dollar defense budget – the highest level since World War II. It creates a new Space Force and funds research into dozens of remotely possible military threats. Relative to defense spending, the $6.5 billion CDC budget is tiny."

Our local news only had minimal report with the only major coverage was during the evacuation of Indonesian nationals from Wuhan by the Ministry of Health and the Indonesian Air Force a week ago - if you saw some videos about passengers debarking from a plane being sprayed by people with hazmat suit, that was it.

The government and the Ministry of Health keeps stating that we're free, clean, no one got infected (yet). There was no confirmed cases. All those who're suspected has been declared negative (only common flu/pneumonia), etc... 

***\[Unconfirmed, but this theme and lots of stories has been circulating on the local soc-med for sometime:\]***

*The downplay has caused some rumours, saying it is because Indonesia (especially the government) is deeply tied with the PRC (China invested tens of billions of dollars in Indonesia, we are one of their biggest market in Asia). Or to quote the movie 'Contagion': ""****In bed with****.""*

*But when someone is feeling sick (according to the symptoms defined by the WHO and CDC), they were being rejected at hospitals and clinics: saying ""We can't test you, we don't have the test kit."" or ""We can't accept or treat you here, we do not have the required equipment (means quarantine facilities / equipment / staffs)""... But the Minister said Indonesia already prepared, we have the test kit, every hospital is prepared and ready, etc... So it is somewhat contradictory. And also weird.. Almost every country AROUND us HAD confirmed cases, but us, as one of the BIGGEST and definitely the MOST POPULATED, had ZERO case whatsoever...*

**\[Confirmed, even the Ministry of Information has started taking actions cause we had actual LAWS regarding hoaxes and mis-informations (Undang Undang ITE) :\]**

Our local soc-med and chatgroups (facebook, twitter, instagram, whatsapp, LINE, etc) was filled with unconfirmed news and hoaxes... which in turn caused some panic buying and stockpiling of masks and hand sanitizers (and now: Garlic (cause someone posted a viral video from china claimed that garlic kills and cures Coronavirus), the price of garlic here has now quadrupled from last week and is expected to keep rising).

It's coronavirus and kills you with your own immune system. 3) death rates are so high because when the cytostorm takes place your body fills with these protien excretions which can lead to seizures and organ failed but MAINLY kill through buildup in the lungs that actually suffocate you as it is looking now. The mortality rate is Def. Higher, I'm guessing actually 40-60% but we just don't know. 4) death rates are low in other countries becuase our medical system and cdc isn't suddenly strained by over 30k cases. One hospital can't out half the patients on machines to breath for them. They don't have the resources. But 2 people. We can monitor and treat properly. 5) Now the worst case is if this hits middle East or afrikan subareas that medical infrastructure wouldn't be able to control/treat. There's about to be some human rights violations in China for sure. No question. Pooh bear reins with terror. However they do have modern medicine and proper hospitals and equipment.

CDC always recommends everyday preventive actions to help prevent the spread of respiratory viruses, including:

* Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after going to the bathroom; before eating; and after blowing your nose, coughing, or sneezing.
* If soap and water are not readily available, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol. Always wash hands with soap and water if hands are visibly dirty.
* Avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth with unwashed hands.
* Avoid close contact with people who are sick.
* Stay home when you are sick.
* Cover your cough or sneeze with a tissue, then throw the tissue in the trash.
* Clean and disinfect frequently touched objects and surfaces using a regular household cleaning spray or wipe.

LONDON/BEIJING (Reuters) - Independent scientists questioned research on Friday that suggested that the outbreak of coronavirus disease spreading from China might have passed from bats to humans through the illegal traffic of pangolins.But James Wood, head of the veterinary medicine department at Britain’s University of Cambridge, said the research was far from robust.

“The evidence for the potential involvement of pangolins in the outbreak has not been published, other than by a university press release. This is not scientific evidence,” he said.
“Simply reporting detection of viral RNA with sequence similarity of more than 99% is not sufficient. Could these results have been caused by contamination from a highly infected environment?”

Pangolins are one of Asia’s most trafficked mammals, despite laws banning the trade, because their meat is considered a delicacy in countries such as China and their scales are used in traditional medicine.

“We would need to see all of the genetic data to get a feel for how related the human and pangolin viruses are, and also gain an understanding of how prevalent this virus is in pangolins and whether or not these were being sold in the Wuhan wet markets,” he said.
Dirk Pfeiffer, a professor of veterinary medicine at Hong Kong’s City University, also said the research was a long way from establishing a link between pangolins and the new coronavirus outbreak in humans.
“You can only draw more definitive conclusions if you compare prevalence (of the coronavirus) between different species based on representative samples, which these almost certainly are not,” he said."

Attachment to change causes suffering, we will all experience different forms of suffering, and we are all going to eventually die. It might be useful to ask yourself a series of ""whys"" about what is making yourself feel anxious around preparedness, because that can get you at the psychological root cause.

For example:

* Why do I feel like I need to be prepared? Because coronavirus.
* Why am I worried about coronavirus? Because it's spreading fast and causing quarantines.
* Why am I worried about quarantines? .... etc

As a side note, I think it's important to also acknowledge that marketing for preparedness products is almost entirely fear-based. Even just looking into it can cause anxiety. Stuff like ""THIS CANISTER HAS THIRTY DAYS OF FOOD FOR WHEN THE GOVERNMENT COMES TO TAKE OUR GUNS AND WHEN YOUR NEIGHBORS ARE DYING DUE TO BIOLOGICAL WARFARE"" isn't exactly soothing reading material and can add to that slippery slope."

I have however never seen a Kickstarter campaign (not even a really big one with 10000s of backers) where the US fulfilment is already basically done, while the copies for Europe (in this case the English-language copies in particular) do not even have a set date to ship out of China yet. Right now I'm a part of two such campaigns: Oceans and the Underworld expansion for Root. 

I was annoyed at NSG in particular because for a part of the campaign they were basically pretending on KS that anything but the copies to North America wasn't really their business, because partners are handling the rest. (Guess what -- we still bought the game from NSG!) 
They have however apologised for this and rectified the mistake. 

The extra delays that are now happening due to the coronavirus epidemic are of course nobody's fault, but the initial ones could have been avoided. 

(Oceans is my third NSG Kickstarter, and there was already some amount of chaos with one of the other ones.

The users were memorializing Li, who is considered the first to sound the alarm about the deadly new virus when he leaked a Dec. 30 document from his hospital confirming a diagnosis. On Jan. 1, he was detained and silenced by Wuhan police, who accused him of spreading lies.

On the Chinese mainland, where such gatherings are often quickly snuffed out, supporters around the country used the Internet to order deliveries of flowers to Wuhan Central, where Li worked and died.

This is not true, it probably should  be classified as one at this time, but has not ""officially"" been classified as such."
2020-02-07,heilich,Coronavirus,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/f0bg1d/where_is_the_death_rate_of_23_coming_from/fgsluae/,"Let's take a look at the current numbers: 

#Cases

[As of Feb 7, 2020] (https://gisanddata.maps.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html#/bda7594740fd40299423467b48e9ecf6) we have total 31523 confirmed cases:

* 638 deaths
* 1758 recovered
* 29127 unresolved 

From this we can calculate, that *out of the resolved cases*:

    (638 deaths) / (2396 total resolved) = 27% died and 73% recovered

We have to keep in mind that it takes longer for person to recover than to die from the illness, and hospitals do tests only for the most severely ill ones, so the above calculation isn't a good representation of the actual chances of dying of this flu.

#World Health Organization

The only number given out by World Health Organization (WHO) so far has been a case fatality rate (CFR), which is the number of deaths divided by total confirmed cases. 

    (638 deaths) / (31523 confirmed cases) = 2% case fatality rate

While this is the correct way to calculate case fatality rate, this number doesn't give accurate estimation of the actual mortality rate of the flu, because it is an ongoing situation where majority of the confirmed cases are still unresolved. We don't have the information of whether the unresolved cases end up recovering or dying.

WHO themselves mentioned in the same [press conference](https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/media-resources/press-briefings#): ""*The only number currently known is how many people have died out of those who have been reported to the WHO...it is therefore very early to make any conclusive statements about what the overall mortality rate will be*"".

#The Lancet Study

https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(20)30211-7/fulltext

A study published in The Lancet tracked 99 confirmed cases from Wuhan Jinyintan Hospital. Death rate in that study was **11%**. We have to keep in mind that people in this study were not young an healthy to begin with.

#Reported Numbers vs Reality

The reported numbers only include those who have been tested positive for the virus. A lot of the actual infections will go undiagnosed because China has reached their maximum capacity to test. Hospitals don't have enough test kits to test everyone. Also, majority of people with symptoms will choose to stay at home instead of going to the overcrowded hospitals where infected are gathered and spreading the virus around.  There have even been cases where people were tested positive for the virus and had no symptoms at all, so we really have no idea of the true number of infected people. However, we can safely assume that total number of infected is much much more than the reported confirmed cases.

There's also the very likely possibility that even the reported numbers are inaccurate, as China's officials could be reporting much lower numbers (of both infected and dead) for various political and economic reasons. 

Even if the true number of deaths would be a lot higher than reported, which is probably is because undiagnosed patients are not included in the statistics of the virus, the actual number of infected could easily be higher than 500 000 which means the mortality rate is still low. It's very unlikely that mortality rate of this illness ends up being higher than **5%**.

#Comparison

For comparison, the case fatality rate of similar viruses and seasonal flu: 

* SARS (**11%**)
* MERS (**35%**)
* Seasonal Flu (**less than 0.08%.**)"

2020-02-07,SimoneNonvelodico,rational,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/f0bnye/d_friday_open_thread/fgspvkq/,"Real talk - I feel quite a bit stressed about this all and I need to vent, plus any experience/advice would be welcome.

The recent Coronavirus situation has made me rethink a lot about my health situation. I'm not panicking about it specifically - it's just that it made me realise how in practice I'm likely to be quite vulnerable from a respiratory point of view. I've been living in the Oxford area for years now, and apparently this is quite the polluted zone. This has taken a toll as now I've got adult onset asthma, albeit a very light form, that has me on preventer inhalers all the time. My doctor says that it's unlikely to ever go away as long as I live here. This kind of thing can't be good - no one has ever mentioned the C- word yet, but I doubt frankly breathing in pollution all the time does wonders for my long term chances in that sense either. I've been considering moving away for a while now. The problem is, to move I would likely need to change jobs, and that's a bit of a toughie. 

I'm a scientist and currently I work in a research council. Job wise this might be possibly the best position for me - it's not perfect, but I have no teaching burdens and get a lot of freedom in my projects and managing my time, which is something I cherish. If I were to leave here, it'd be unlikely I could find another job in a similar position while staying in the UK. So it'd be either the private sector, or trying for academia. Thing is, the first option worries me that I might find myself frustrated with a job where I'm much more constrained and have less opportunities to actually apply my knowledge in full; the second option seems far more attractive on the face of it, but it means throwing myself into the whirlwind of crazy competitiveness that universities have become as of late, and in the end working my ass off and suffering through a lot of stress I'm not sure I'd be able to take in order to end up becoming almost only an administrator, writing grant requests all the time, which seems to be what most professors do once they progress enough in their career.

Does anyone here have personal experience of either environment? What is your take on their pros/cons? Mind you, both options would likely be better paid than my current job, so that's not the issue. It's more a matter of long term satisfaction and happiness. I may be underestimating for example the level of stress I can take because in these last times I felt very weak/lethargic. Maybe a job that interests me more could energise me. As I am now, I have a really hard time imagining that in 10 years I'd have the strength to cope with a very stressful job that I could barely handle now, but that might be a wrong impression."

It is constructed from three viruses: two coronaviruses-bat coronavirus and snake coronavirus, plus four inserts from the human immunodeficiency virus were found. There can be no such natural mutation, "" says virologist Igor Nikulin, a former member of the UN Commission on biological weapons.

Virologist Igor Nikulin, however, believes that the Americans had a hand in creating the NcoV2019 virus. By the way, the scandal with the laboratory in the Lugar center in Georgia, built with the money of the United States, is still fresh in my memory. And there, according to the former chief of the Georgian state security Igor Georgadze, specialists from the United States with diplomatic immunity conducted biological experiments on people and in one day, for unknown reasons, 24 people died, and there were more than 70 victims in total. Georgadze then showed documents describing, for example, the means of delivering infected insects. The Russian Ministry of defense is also interested in the story, so it's serious. Official Tbilisi, as well as Washington, denied everything. But who will admit it?! And in the case of China, there is a motive.

""I tend to believe that this is either the activity of American intelligence agencies or American pharmaceutical corporations that just wanted to make money. How did they do it on the epidemic of bird flu, swine flu, the same SARS, "" said Igor Nikulin.

Another version is popular in the Network — the new coronavirus allegedly affects only Asians. And although there are not enough statistics for such claims and there are already a couple of refutations, the field for conspiracy theories is only getting wider. Maybe there is an ethnic bioweapon? Even those scientists who are cautious in their estimates say that nothing can be excluded. Alexander Chepurnov at the time, studied the causative agent of Vilyuisk encephalomyelitis. And there is one mystery in it that leads to seemingly sci-Fi thoughts.

""Still, some technical or theoretical approaches to creating ethnic weapons are possible. That is, it is not possible to exclude completely the possibility of creating such structures, because, as far as we know, the disease suffered only Yakuts, evens and Evenks"" — said an employee of the Institute of experimental and clinical medicine, Siberian branch of RAS Alexander Chepurnov."

Australia is quarantining people who’ve recently been to China’s Hubei province, many of whom are of Asian descent, on an offshore island.

Under the pseudonym Tyler Durden, the founder of a right-wing financial blog called ZeroHedge posted an article, “Is This The Man Behind The Global Coronavirus Pandemic?” sharing the name and personal information of a Chinese doctor and researcher at the Wuhan Institute of Virology, accusing him of collaborating with the Chinese government to develop engineered bioweapons]

The way I understand it, you can't certify a disposable filter since there's no seal, so manufacturers label them as pm2.5 to be consistent with air quality standards (PM2.5 covers everything up to 2.5 microns). However, there seems to be a lot of evidence that even a quality, sealed N95 respirators can have a ""leakage factor"" of up to 5%, whereas a good fitted mask with a disposable filter isn't going to be much worse.

The catch is that ""pure"" airborne virions are smaller than .3 microns, so even if N95 filter 95% of everything .3 microns or larger, N99 filtering 99%, etc., there's still going to be particulates getting through the filter. Coronavirus virions are relatively large as far as viruses go, at a little over .1 micron, so an N95-rated filter should be filtering *some* of the virus, but it won't filter all. I've heard anywhere between 50% - 90%, depending on the filter, but since there's no standard for such small particles this info isn't typically available unless you have access to a laboratory ;)"

What? How did you arrive at this conclusion? Zika was identified in the 1950s and is very similar to its flavivirus cousins (less dangerous than most). Avian flu (H5N1) is literally just one of many flu strains.

The first coronaviruses were identified in the 1960s, and are one of several that cause the common cold. You've almost certainly had a few coronavirus infections over the course of your life. SARS, MERS-CoV and the new nCov-2019 are unusually dangerous examples, but there is no evidence whatsoever that they were engineered.

I don't see how vaccines could have anything to do with these recent spillovers either. Putting domesticated food animals in close quarters with wild animals and humans is a receipe for disaster. Bats in particular carry all sorts of nasties and being routinely exposed to bat viscera will eventually cause problems whether you got a flu shot or not."

> The emphasis will now be on ""aggressively trying to stop or limit further spread"", according to the Ministry of Health's (MOH) pandemic readiness and preparedness plan. Code Orange is one step below Red, which signifies an out-of-control pandemic.

> ""We have been preparing for this scenario and we are ready to manage this situation,"" said Health Minister Gan Kim Yong at a press conference.

> ""The key is quick detection and managing the local spread.""

> The heightened response comes as the ministry announced three new cases on Friday - all are Singaporeans not linked to any earlier clusters who had not been to China recently.

> These include:

> - A 53-year-old man who was in Malaysia on three separate days in January;- A 42-year-old woman, a teacher at Victoria Junior College;

> A 39-year-old woman who was in Malaysia from Jan 22 to Jan 29.

> The three new uncases were discovered because hospitals here have started testing all pneumonia patients for the virus, MOH said.

> The total number of people infected here has grown to 33.

> Two of the patients have been discharged, but two are now in critical condition and in the intensive care unit, said MOH on Friday.

> With Code Orange, new precautionary measures will be in place to minimise the risk of further virus transmission to the community.

> This includes schools cancelling all inter-school events and external activities till the end of the March holidays, companies implementing business contingency plans; limiting visits to pre-schools and eldercare services, and temperature screening in hospitals.

> The Government has been ramping up defensive measures since January, and has put in place various measures, including quarantine for close contacts of those found with the disease, as well as more stringent screening measures at hospitals.

> Mr Gan pointed out that many of the measures in Orange are already in place, and are being stepped up.

> During Friday's press conference National Development Minister Lawrence Wong pointed out that the mortality rate of the disease is much lower outside of Hubei.

> While it is 2 per cent in Hubei, the epicentre of the disease, it is 0.2 per cent elsewhere, he noted.

> ""We are still doing our best to prevent broader community spread in Singapore,"" said Mr Wong, co-chair of the multi-ministry task force tackling the outbreak.

> Singapore moved to Code Orange during the H1N1 influenza outbreak in 2009.

> The coding system was set up after the 2003 Sars (Severe acute respiratory syndrome) outbreak.

> Under the Disease Outbreak Response System Condition or Dorscon, Orange means the outbreak is deemed to have moderate to high public health impact.

> It is acknowledgement that there is local spread, with possibility that the disease may spread even more widely across the country. However in spite of the increased spread, the situation is still under control.

> Mr Gan, who co-chairs the task force, said the authorities are monitoring the situation closely, and will ramp up measures if necessary.

> ""I understand Singaporeans are anxious, concerned, and there is much we don't yet know about the virus,"" he said, noting that new information is emerging daily.

> ""We expect this may take some time to resolve, maybe months to resolve.

> ""Life cannot come to a standstill. We will do our best to obtain further information and keep Singaporeans safe.""

I agree that the number of tested is going to be far lower than the ammount of people with the virus isn't surprising. The issue is China cannot and will not be able to test anywhere near the number of people with the virus. The current advise their is not to leave the house and isolate yourself for 14 days. The number if people tested to have coronavirus is a meaningless figure.

Nothing I have said constitutes a wild accusation. China are very clearly covering up the scale of the issue within china. The doctor who first raised concern over coronavirus posted the threatening letters from the chinese government after he raised the issue. Since his death yesterday much of china share this distrust and are outraged over the clear cover up. If anything you're the naive nut.

> SINGAPORE - Singapore has moved up its response to the coronavirus outbreak to Code Orange because of ""heightened risk"", said the Ministry of Health (MOH).

> This is because there are now four cases of infection with no known links to China or people already infected, which means the disease may be spreading in the community.

> It is only the second time Singapore has activated Code Orange. The first was for Swine Flu (H1N1) in 2009. The coding system was set up after Sars (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome)in 2003. The outbreak then would also have been 'orange' had the classification existed.

> Under the Disease Outbreak Response System Condition or Dorscon, Orange means the outbreak is deemed to have moderate to high public health impact.

> With Singapore now in Code Orange, MOH said on Feb 7 that it is introducing additional measures ""to minimise the risk of further transmission of the virus in the community"".

> The emphasis will now be on ""aggressively trying to stop or limit further spread"", according to MOH's pandemic readiness and preparedness plan.

> Measures to be impmented:

> * Event organisers are advised to cancel or defer non-essential large-scale events. Those who choose to continue should take additional precautions.

> - Carry out temperature screening.

> - Look out for respiratory symptoms such as cough or runny nose, and deny entry to people who are sick.

> - Remind participants to declare travel history to China.

> - Ensure the venue is well ventilated with enough facilities for hand washing.

> - Increase frequency of cleaning of commonly used areas.

> - Maintain a registration list of pariticipants if possible.

> People who are on Leave of Absence (LOA) should not attend such events.

> * Employers are urged to require staff to conduct regular temperature taking, at least twice a day. Anyone with a fever should see a doctor immediately. If their temperature is above 38 degrees celsius, they should not be at work.

> Staff should also be checked for cough or runny nose.

> Companies should step up their business continuity plans, which includes asking employees to telecommute, or segregating them into teams.

> * MOH will implement temperature screening and closer controls of entry points into hospitals. Patients with pneumonia will be separated from other patients to reduce risk of transmission.

> * Schools will immediately stop all inter-school and external activities till the end of the March school holidays. This includes national school games, learning journeys and camps.

> Primary school teachers will take pupils to toilets to wash their hands before recess and snack breaks. Secondary school students will be reminded to do so.

> Preschools and eldercare facilities will limit the number of visitors to their premises.

> MOH said that all its measures will be effective only if everyone plays their part.

> Since the virus can be spread through direct contact with individuals as well as via contaminated surfaces, it is critical to ensure good hygiene.

> Regular hand washing with soap and water, or failing that, use sanitisers. People should avoid touching their faces unnecessarily.

> These were all measures Singapore had implemented during the Sars outbreak.

Proof is all over the internet, you just have to know where to look. Death toll in Wuhan is MUCH higher than what everyone is saying: Wuhan has 7 total crematoriums which are running 24/7 for longer than 7 days now... burning a minimum of 100 bodies per day at each crematorium. This has been validated with documentation along with a video showcasing trashcans filled with ashes in front of these crematoriums. It takes 2-3 hours to burn a body completely with each bodies ashes weighing around 3-6Lbs. Looking at the Map of Wuhan, most of them if not all 7 crematoriums are along the Yangtze River which a video was posted showcasing thicker black smoke than normal throughout the city of Wuhan. This virus can dormant up to 14 days which will show no signs of illness, even if you get tested and you don't have the symptoms right there and then? You will show up negative. There are multiple cases of individuals testing negative and then a few days later symptoms arise and they go back for testing with results showing up positive. This virus changes properties when it transfers from human to human along with surviving without a host for up to 5 days on flat surfaces, facets, doorknobs and more (this virus is a man-made biochemical offensive weapon meant to annihilate). Viruses that can transmit from animals to humans, known as zoonoses, account for about 75 percent of emerging diseases. It's a group of diseases that includes influenza, rabies and HIV. Bubonic plague is a zoonosis that killed a third of the human population in the 14th century. I write this not to scare nor falsify these claims but to provide awareness and truth to anyone who read this. Start preparing NOW and help spread the TRUTH about this virus. When buying face masks, ONLY buy the N95 models as those have a higher percentage of blocking coronavirus. A normal face mask will not prevent this virus AT ALL. Have much more information along with what is truly taking place in America and other countries. Do not believe the CDC or World Health Organizations statistics as their is a global media blackout taking place right now (another story for another day). The true numbers will not be covered by our corporate media outlets around the world at this point in time as they are getting ALL their statistics from the CDC and WHO; I should know, I worked for a major media outlet so I understand how the game is played.

European physicians furthermore employed these enemas for a range of ailments.Tobacco was recognised by Europeans as a medicine soon after it was first imported from the New World, and tobacco smoke was used by western medical practitioners as a tool against cold and drowsiness.

When the coronavirus first hit the news in china, many non-infected people swarmed the hospitals and this stretched wuhans response thin, which led to it's quarantine. Wuhan is roughly the size of new york city, so imagine an 8th of manhattan suddenly going to the hospital because they think they are sick, while there are real sick people going to the hospital. Yeah, its gonna spread. So, all im saying is that pandemic can stretch a governments resources when responding to the virus, so people should be informed enough to be prepared and to know how to respond.

That is 7.8billion x 2% = 156 million people die

Coronavirus will most likely only kill off older people, and people with compromised systems, or who are already ill. This means birth rates probably wont decrease because of it.  


A world wide pandemic with a 2% mortality rate wouldn't even have an effect on population growth post 2 years. That's crazy stuff! It may even mean that the natural death rate is reduced for the years following, as the virus would be basically borrowing deaths from the future from those most at risk of a timely end.  


We can have a coronavirus like epidemic every 2 years and it would only just stabilise population growth."

I dont think we have much to worry about though in terms of them spreading the virus too much. I've been pretty paranoid the past two weeks, watching dauly videos on Youtube like peak prosperity, medcram, etc and also reading up via twitter and here on reddit. Percentage wise, seems like we in the USA might have lucked out. As long as we can contain and treat those coming in with the virus, our medical system is pretty well equipped to handle the patient load. The problem in China wasn't incompetent medical professionals, but rather their country bandwidth and lack of preparation for an unexpected virus. On another note, I spoke to a colleague of mine who works on Zona Rio (Tijuana)... supplies of n95 and n99 masks have dried up there too and he says people are wearing masks everywhere. For what it's worth, he also said half of his employees are working ""remote"" due to bad flu symptoms.

> However, DRAMeXchange said that memory companies don't have anything to fear because their fabs have remained operational despite the Coronavirus outbreak. In some cases that's because of strict monitoring policies for workers entering the factories, but in others it's because the companies aren't particularly close to Wuhan.

>""In terms of DRAM suppliers, of the three major suppliers, only SK Hynix’s production base in Wuxi is located in China, but since it is far away from Wuhan it has not been directly impacted by the outbreak,"" DRAMExchange said in a press release today.

>""Also, during the Chinese New Year, the shifts of most fab employees have already been scheduled, so the production line remains operational. Overall, there is currently no substantial impact on DRAM production, but it is still imperative to monitor whether the potential spreading of the virus can affect China’s logistics and transportation system, subsequently causing a nationwide material shortage.""

>NAND suppliers seem to have a bit more to worry about. DRAMeXchange said that YMTC and XMC might not be able to stay operational with the quarantine but added that shouldn't be too big of a deal because ""the current capacity of YMTC’s Wuhan fab accounts for only around 1% of wafer input of the entire NAND flash industry.""

So, the report this mag is quoting actually contradicts the conclusions of the mag's report. We're already seeing a dip in petrol and diesel prices in India as China quarantines the Hubei province. And as per the reports, the electronics except maybe NAND, will get cheaper as consumption in China grinds to a halt.

I made a logical argument to counter your belief that China is not responsible for the WHO denying Taiwan support/assistance in regards to the Wuhan Coronavirus.

You stated that China was not responsible for the WHO refusing to cooperate with Taiwan.

In actuality they are the sole reason why Taiwan is left out and denied critical information regarding the virus and forced to fend for themselves.

You stated that the blame rests on the United Nations/U.S, who voted Taiwan out... but who pressured the UN members, WHO etc to deny that Taiwan exists independently of the PRC and to isolate them politically? The PRC.

I’ve dismantled your argument, stop being so defensive and think logically. Try to reason outside your own bias.

Can wearing a medical face mask protect you against the new coronavirus? It's a question many people, including pet owners who are putting canine face masks on their dogs, are asking. 

If it's a regular surgical face mask, the answer is ""no,"" Dr. William Schaffner, an infectious-disease specialist at Vanderbilt University in Tennessee, told Live Science. 

A more specialized mask, known as an N95 respirator, can protect against the new coronavirus, also called 2019-nCoV. The respirator is thicker than a surgical mask, but Schaffner doesn't recommend it for public use, at least not at this point."

> SINGAPORE - On the day he developed symptoms of the coronavirus, a 41-year-old Singaporean with no apparent links to the previous infected cases nor travel history to China had a lohei lunch with about 20 colleagues at a well-known Chinese restaurant in Jurong, a source told The Straits Times.

> It is understood that at least eight of them have now been quarantined.

> The source who knows the 41-year-old infected patient said government officials served his colleagues the quarantine orders from around midnight to about 4am on Friday (Feb 7).

> The man was one of two new confirmed cases announced by the Health Ministry on Thursday night. The other new case is a 27-year-old man who was one of four investigated by the National Centre for Infectious Diseases (NCID) after attending a private business meeting at the Grand Hyatt.

> The 41-year-old had developed a fever on Jan 28, the same day he had lunch with his colleagues. ST understands that he works in a company in Jurong.

> He went to two general practitioner (GP) clinics on Jan 29 and Jan 30 respectively, and was subsequently admitted to Mount Elizabeth Novena Hospital on Feb 3.

> One of the clinics is Phoenix Medical Group in Greenwich V in Seletar.

> According to a letter circulated by the clinic and seen by ST, the man had visited the clinic twice, once on Jan 30 and again on Feb 3.

> He ""appeared quite ill with gastrointestinal and respiratory symptoms, and a moderate fever"", said the letter, which was addressed to friends and patients of Phoenix Medical.

> He was advised to go to the emergency department, but as he ""did not fulfil the MOH criteria for a suspect case"", he was not sent to hospital via the dedicated ambulance service.

> He is now warded at the NCID in an isolation ward, the clinic added.

> The clinic's rooms, corridors, table tops, seats and examination couches have since been thoroughly cleaned, said the medical group.

> ""Our physician who saw the patient has not been ordered to go on home quarantine or leave of absence, but has voluntarily opted to take a leave of absence till Feb 17, 2020,"" said Phoenix Medical.

> ST has contacted the man's company for comments.

2. Why you choose this course/job?
3. Something you did/experience/study relate to the skill needed for the job/course. E.g Designing using Photoshop, learned it to make poster for club activities.

You can get a lot of tips online. Try to answer the questions based on your desire to learn more and show curiosity towards the course. Keep asking questions about the course that you're curious about, don't ask blindly refer to their courses details/syllabus and plan your questions from there.

Another tips, when open the door; greets them with ~~your killer~~ smile and shake hands (depending on the gender) if needed to do so (with coronavirus nowadays, probably best not to do it; give them the reason not to; it show you know current situation/news). Just be polite, ask something like ""pardon me, but can you repeat the question"" if you didn't get it.

Regarding having lots of certificates, not that important but just consider it as added bonus. You can talk more on these and it will show what you're interested in and they know you're an active student."

2020-02-07,AutomaticNewspaper,australia,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/australia/comments/f072sk/first_exemption_to_the_china_visa_ban_made/fgrwbm1/,"A Chinese mother whose only son is on life support in a Melbourne hospital says she is overjoyed to be given an emergency visa and says she ""just wants to see him"".

Xing Lan Ren's son, 22-year-old Xiao Li, has been in the Royal Melbourne Hospital in a critical condition since his car collided with a truck on January 27 between Melbourne and his home in Sale, East Gippsland. He was declared brain dead on Monday.

On Friday afternoon, acting Immigration Minister Alan Tudge said the government had granted Ms Ren a visa in what was its first exemption to the blanket ban on foreign nationals coming from China due to ""overwhelming compassionate and other considerations"".

Mr Tudge said government officials were now liaising with Ms Ren to bring her to Australia as soon as possible, with doctors expected to keep Mr Li's life support on until she arrives. A friend of Mr Li said she is planning to arrive in Melbourne on Sunday morning.

Mr Tudge said: ""Xiao Li’s mother has been granted that tourist visa, so she will be coming to Australia.""

""Typically we ask people to quarantine themselves for 14 days after arriving in Australia [due to coronavirus fears].

""In this instance we’re going to work very closely with her to ensure that she can nevertheless see her son and properly take care of the funeral arrangements and other issues which she needs to deal with.""

Andy Yuan, a friend of Mr Li in Melbourne who has been regularly speaking with his mother, said Ms Ren ""appreciates everybody who helped her son"".

""She said she knows everybody tried their best to save him,"" Mr Yuan told The Age.

""She’s very thankful for all the doctors, nurses and social workers, giving great help to Xiao. They are really taking care of him, although we all know his damage is too big so he cannot survive. But everybody appreciates the help of the hospital.""


Mr Yuan said Mr Li's mother, who is also a widow, on Thursday granted permission for her son's organs to be donated, which doctors said would help 10 Australians.

Ms Ren applied for an Australian visa on January 29, paying a total of $1145 to fast-track her application with a normal response time of two business days.

Less than 72 hours later, on February 1, Prime Minister Scott Morrison announced the minimum 14-day ban on foreign nationals travelling from mainland China.

It will be Ms Ren's first international trip, after she acquired her first passport last week to apply for the visa.

Mr Li, 22, was declared brain dead on Monday.

A group of Mr Li's friends had been advocating for Australia to issue an exemption to the travel ban, and Mr Yuan said they were elated.

""I can't believe it, it's such great news. I feel so happy that Xiao's mum will come to see her son,"" he told The Age.

Mr Tudge said it was unclear how she will reach Melbourne from her home in Qingdao, about 1000 kilometres north-east of Wuhan, the virus epicentre.

Mr Li's friends, however, on Friday indicated she will fly on a commercial flight from Qingdao, which is in Shandong province.

Shandong province has recorded 379 cases of coronavirus, with no fatalities so far.

Mr Tudge said when the travel ban was imposed on February 1, the Australian Border Force Commissioner was given the power to grant exemptions in individual cases.

“Obviously the balance here … was the desire for her to be able to come out here to see her son and cater for his funeral arrangements while at the same time not jeopardising the broader health of the Australian population,” he said. “We can manage this, though.”

Mr Tudge said Ms Ren’s arrival would be “very carefully” managed, and a Royal Melbourne Hospital spokeswoman said the hospital would work alongside the appropriate agencies to manage the health and safety of Ms Ren's visit.

The minister denied Ms Ren’s visa would set a precedent for other Chinese visitors, and said he was not aware of any other requests on compassionate grounds.

“Every individual case will be dealt with on [its] merits,” he said.

It was also confirmed on Friday that Mr Li is covered by Victorian road insurance, meaning he has unlimited medical and hospital cover.

Ms Ren can also claim up to about $24,000 in visiting expenses and almost $16,000 in funeral expenses.

Mr Tudge revealed about 8.30am on Friday that the government was considering the exemption, before it was granted about 12.30pm."

The chinese people have very poor hygiene, it is common to not have soap in public toilets and people rarely wash their hands. 

Most chinese people might not be able to afford to not go to work, so they will continue spreading.

The problem is, that the coronavirus itself is not very lethal if you can get treatment, but once hospitals are overrun, it becomes a massive problem as most people cant get treatment. 

The problem in china is that the culture is fueling the spread, and the hospitals are understaffed and undergeared. They lack sanitary and protective equipment, so this makes it spread even further. 

The virus doesn't have to be lethal to be extremely harmful, this is going to put a massive dent in the chinese economy if many people end up sick and unable to work."

Cinco llegados de China están en aislamiento

Doris Pantaleón
Santo Domingo, RD

La llegada de viajeros chinos y de otras nacionalidades con historia de haber visitado China durante los últimos 30 días, ha activado el sistema de vigilancia epidemiológica en los aeropuertos, motivando la vigilancia cercana a por lo menos 16 personas, **entre ellos cinco** en aislamiento, dos de ellos presentando síntomas respiratorios.

En tanto, entre la población crece el temor a que en cualquier momento se halle el primer caso de la nueva cepa del coronavirus (2019- nCoV) detectado en diciembre pasando en Wuhan, China, que se manifiesta con infección respiratoria aguda grave y cuyos casos ya se han detectado en por lo menos 27 países, entre ellos Estados Unidos.

**Cinco en aislamiento**

Desde ayer, cinco personas, incluyendo **cuatro chinos y un chileno,** se encuentran en la unidad de aislamiento habilitada para esos fines en el hospital Militar Ramón de Lara, al ser detectado a su llegada al país vía aérea, mientras por lo menos otros 11 están recibiendo visitas diarias en sus hogares o lugares de hospedaje de parte de personal del Ministerio de Salud Pública.

Ginecoobstetras advierten
Cuidados generales y una vigilancia cercana a toda embarazada que presente afección respiratoria es parte de las medidas preventivas ante el alerta internacional que existe frente al nuevo coronavirus (2019-nCoV) que circula actualmente en varios países.

La sugerencia la hace el ginecoobstetra Milcíades Albert, presidente del Consejo de Asesores de la Sección Dominicana del American College of Obstetrics and Gynecologists (ACOG), al destacar que entre los especialistas siempre se ha tenido el temor de que esos virus nuevos hagan estragos en la embarazada porque su condición de embarazo hace que tenga un cierto estado de inmunodeficiencia."

“This paper may or may not be flawed — it needs further investigation,” said Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. “But I don’t think it negates the concept.”
“We had been getting reports from highly reliable people in China — scientists, investigators and public health people who we’ve known over the years — and they’ve been telling us, ‘There’s asymptomatic disease, for sure, and we are seeing asymptomatic transmission,’” Dr. Fauci said.
Asymptomatic transmission is unlikely to be driving the epidemic within China, he added, but “it complicates our job.”
If the early symptoms include such common complaints as back pain, then infected individuals and their doctors are unlikely to consider the possibility that the patient is infected with a coronavirus, said Marc Lipsitch, professor of epidemiology at Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health in Boston.
“From a practical perspective, that is almost the same as if she had no symptoms at all,” Dr. Lipsitch said. “Headaches are very common, and the coronavirus is not the principal cause thereof, and they’re not observable by a third party.”
