That's what Dr Fauci / The White House is essentially saying too.

The estimates of 100k-240k deaths are predicated on lockdown measures actually being followed.

The problem is, many places still have woefully inadequate lockdown measures.

And we still don't have enough PPE for... anyone. Is this even taken into consideration for these models?"

2020-04-02,ComplexConcepts,YouShouldKnow,19,https://www.reddit.com/r/YouShouldKnow/comments/ftuo4p/ysk_you_are_entitled_to_a_refund_if_an_airline/fm9jq1t/,"To those who wish to know the actual US law and their rights when trying to get a refund from an airline who does business in the US... Please read 14 CFR Part 374, US contract law (UCC), 49 USC 41712, and the Fair Credit Billing Act. The highlights are all carriers who do business in the US must provide a refund in the original form of payment for a flight they cancelled (for any reason) if requested. The key to getting a refund is not accepting something else of value (e.g. a voucher) for a flight the airline cancelled. If the airline gives you the run around you can always sue, but if you paid with a credit card there is an easier way to get a refund if eligible and applicable which I will go into further details below...

To those who are trying to get a refund on a non-refundable flight that has been cancelled by the airline, the law is on your side. There are certain criteria that must apply though. One, you used a credit card to pay for the airfare. Two, the airline must have cancelled the flight (even for reasons outside of their control such as the coronavirus pandemic). Three, you cannot have accepted an itinerary change or credit for future travel. Four, you must have made a good faith attempt at getting a refund from the merchant pursuant to United States Code Title 15, Chapter 41, Subchapter I, Part D, Section 1666i(a)(1). And lastly, you must write and mail a letter to your credit card issuer disputing the charge pursuant to USC Title 15, Chapter 41, Subchapter I, Part D, Section 1666(a). Please note, legally, your billing rights are only protected if you send your credit card issuer a written letter within 60 days from the statement date that first showed the charge (so if you paid for your ticket a little more than 60 days from the departure date, you may not be legally protected under this law. Some card issuers may still accept a dispute outside this 60 day window, but it's their discretion). Also, some card issuers do the dispute process online or over the phone, but you still must write and mail them a letter to be legally protected. Exercising this right forces them to start an investigation and respond to your dispute with a decision within 90 days. A sample letter can be found here... https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/articles/0385-sample-letter-disputing-billing-errors

The actual law that entitles you to a refund when an airline cancels a flight is USC Title 15, Chapter 41 Subchapter I Part D Section 1666(b)(3) which basically says if the merchant failed to provide the agreed upon service, it's considered a billing error that the credit card issuer must correct. (Note, this law applies to any credit card transaction, not just to airfare.) In this scenario, however, the agreed upon service is flights departing from a specific location, to a specific location, and on a specific day (note, significant itinerary changes may also qualify as a failure in agreed upon service, but this definition varies among different airlines' contract of carriage). So if the merchant doesn't hold up their end of the deal (e.g. cancelling the flight), it's considered a billing error that your credit card issuer must correct. Most importantly, this law overrules any of the merchant's own policies. But make sure you don't accept an itinerary change or credit for future travel because the merchant (e.g. airline) will use that as evidence to say you accepted a new service agreement, and then the credit card issuer will most likely deny the dispute. 

What you don't want to do, however, is accept a credit and then try to do a dispute. This is akin to buyer's remorse and is not a disputable billing error. If you still try the dispute, the credit card issuer and the merchant can claim ""friendly fraud"" against you which can have severe consequences.

In summary, flex your rights with the airline. They usually cave to the refund if they know you know the law. And don't accept a credit for anything if you want a refund. If they still won't budge, do a credit card dispute if eligible, but make sure you document all correspondence with them in order to satisfy Section 1666i requirements of a good faith resolution. I hope this information has been helpful for you."

This doesn't exactly evoke a lot of confidence in his leadership, or even his ability to win in November. The best reasons his campaign has given for this is that they were having trouble setting up for video conferencing from his house, which most people have been able to do in minutes for school or work since the pandemic has kept people home. 

Add to this that there are already lots of rumors about his mental decline, and the recent news about a former staffer, Tara Reade, accusing him of sexual assault, it's making a lot of democrats uneasy about his chances in the general election. 

I suppose the anger stems from the belief that his campaign should've been managing this much better, and helping him to look like a strong leader, especially in contrast to Trump's very obvious bungling of the Coronavirus response. Rather than use this as an opportunity to help people, like Bernie who has used his email list to raise millions for charities to help victims of covid, or even just use it to his advantage and help his campaign, Biden has really flubbed the whole thing by staying out of sight and out of mind."

Choose to wait upwards to a week or two to informing people that one of their coworkers were sick with the coronavirus is a peace of shit.

I'm more likely to believe this ""crap"" of a human being than Amazon. All precautions that Amazon could have taken in January, February, and March, it chose to do nothing until it got bad or a worker gets sick with the virus.

It chose to neither disinfect until people start complaining,

nor did it chose to follow the 6 foot guideline and enforce it, until people start complaining about it.

And you expect a common worker, who got sick by the fault of their employer to be the one to blame?

A shitty employer is a shitty employer, there is no way around it no matter how one views its common workers."

And masks printed on filament deposition printers (hot glue gun printers) are **ineffective** at best and **dangerous** at worst. 

Prints using this method are fundamentally porous and the layer interfaces provide little areas for bacteria/virus to hide, live,and grow. Depending on the plastic used, they may not be able to be properly sterilized without degrading. Steralization is required before use because what if the person who printed it or assembled it is already infected. Steralization may not even be capable of completely killing contaminants hidden in the layer interfaces.  Most importantly, these masks just don't provide the sealing (around the face mostly) and protection required for nanoparticles. 

There are other Additive Manufacturing technologies that have been demonstrated to successfully print masks- multijet fusion and powder bed fusion. Even then, the masks are considered primarily ""stop gaps""- emergency backups if traditional PPE is unavailable. 

If you have a desktop FDM printer your best bet for contributing is producing facemasks. See NIH approved for clinical use here: https://3dprint.nih.gov/collections/covid-19-response"

As they press for the president to ease restrictions to reinvigorate economic activity, some of these figures have assailed Fauci and questioned his expertise. Last month, an article depicting him as an agent of the “deep state” gained nearly 25,000 interactions on Facebook — meaning likes, comments and shares — as it was posted to large pro-Trump groups with titles such as “Trump Strong” and “Tampa Bay Trump Club.”](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/anthony-faucis-security-is-stepped-up-as-doctor-and-face-of-us-coronavirus-response-receives-threats/2020/04/01/ff861a16-744d-11ea-85cb-8670579b863d_story.html)


They also mention crazed fans of Tony being an issue as well, but it’s very obvious that those who are anti-Fauci would be right-wing just based on the current partisanship of Covid-19 in America.

Two weekends ago our coastline (Oregon) was flooded with tens of thousands of out of season and unexpected tourists from other states. The populations of these small coastal towns were horrified, because these people left states under order to shelter in place, no travel not necessary and such, and flooded an area unequipped to handle a pandemic.

The mayors of these small communities held an emergency meeting, and came down with a decision to close all hotels, motels, AirBnb, short term rentals and told the invaders (which is how they were referred to) they had 24 hours to get out of their towns.

It was a massive ""Oops, sorry, lol"" from the invaders who weren't quick to vacate.

Horrifying, actually, that this many people thought it would super cool to do a road trip to small areas and take a vacation during a freaking pandemic.

Right now our entire area is at 21 deaths, but in the last three days we've have a massive spike in  positive cases and people reporting symptom.  Some spots have tripled cases in two days, many have doubled. Guess what happened 10 days ago (the time of incubation).  Yup, the ten of thousands of invaders to the state.

The US has 30x the population of Belgium. So under the same circumstances the US could indeed expect 210.000 deaths this year. However, Belgium went in complete lockdown early on, has very good healthcare services and testing is well above average. With other words the exact opposite of the situation in the US.

The fact is that China made a draconian decision which quarantined and lockdowned the whole country when it had much lower confirmed cases than the USA helped stop the outbreak from Wuhan/Hebui to other provinces. People in China actually obeyed quarantine rules like wearing masks, social distancing, shelter at home and not go to massive gathering in beaches, religious activities and other parties.

So much for all the respect of medical professionals you've been hearing about. Places using the coronavirus as an excuse not to pay and you're supposed to feel good about it because you're volunteering to save lives. 

The one job that called me back, hired me, and I went through three days of orientation, they told me ""ok you can start on Friday"" and I was excited to get back to work.

I worked at the school for over 4 years. I easily qualified for unemployment, I even got paid from unemployment already. I didn't want to sit around and collect unemployment because I want to work and I hate sitting around all day, but its exactly what I'm going to do because healthcare professionals aren't the respected heroes the media is making them out to be.

Days after issuing an executive order urging Tennesseans to stay at home amid the ongoing coronavirus pandemic,Gov. Bill Lee will now mandate the action.

The governor's office said in a news release he would be signing an executive order on Thursday.

The move comes after a growing chorus of Tennesseans and doctors, including most recently former U.S. Sen. Bill Frist, urged Lee to move beyond his recent so called ""safer at home"" order.

The governor's decision comes one day after similar moves were made in other southern states, including Mississippi and Florida. Those states issued such mandates on Wednesday, with Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis citing President Donald Trump's ""changed demeanor"" related to the pandemic.

As of Thursday, state officials reported 2,800 residentshad been infected by COVID-19, with 32 fatalities and 263 hospitalizations.

The governor's statewide mandate is his strongest action to date regarding the ongoing pandemic. Itcomes just one day after he and members of his administration told lawmakers he anticipated a shortage of beds and ventilators in the coming weeks as Tennessee faces a ""crush"" of new cases that could force the state to use alternative facilities like college dorms and convention centers to house patients.

In a statement, Lee said the move was necessary despite decreases in movement throughout Tennessee in recent weeks.

However, in recent days we have seen data indicating that movement may be increasing and we must get these numbers trending back down,"" he said. ""I have updated my previous executive order to clearly require that Tennesseans stay at home unless they are carrying out essential activities.

Prior to Lee's Thursday mandate, he was repeatedly criticized by doctors and public officials throughout the state, including on national media, for stopping short of what's needed.

In his statement, Lee said his administration analyzed cell phone data and traffic patterns to reach the conclusion such a mandate was necessary.

>Oil soared nearly 50 per cent in its biggest ever one-day rally after US President Donald Trump stoked hopes of a supply cut deal led by Saudi Arabia and Russia to alleviate a price collapse triggered by the coronavirus outbreak.   Mr Trump on Thursday said Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman of Saudi Arabia and Russian President Vladimir Putin had begun talks on how to curb production by as much as 15m barrels a day — a large chunk of the world’s oil demand, which stood at 100m b/d last year.  “I expect & hope that they will be cutting back approximately 10 Million Barrels, and maybe substantially more which, if it happens, will be GREAT for the oil & gas industry!” he said. “Could be as high as 15 Million Barrels. Good (GREAT) news for everyone!”  Almost immediately after Mr Trump’s tweet, Saudi Arabia’s state news agency said the kingdom was calling for an emergency meeting of Opec and other oil producer nations, including Russia. It said it sought to reach a “fair” supply deal, without committing to any cuts.  However, the Kremlin rejected Mr Trump’s remarks. “There was no conversation” between Mr Putin and Prince Mohammed, Dmitry Peskov, Mr Putin’s spokesman said, adding that none was planned.  “So far, no one has started talking about any specific or even abstract deals in exchange for Opec+,"" he said, referring to the three-year oil alliance between Opec and Russia that collapsed last month.   One Opec official said the tweet from the US president amounted to “Trump talking before his brain engages”.  On Wednesday Mr Trump said he believed a deal to end a price war — which has taken Brent to its lowest level since 2002 — was imminent, sparking a rally in crude prices.  Brent crude, the international oil benchmark, rose as high as $36.29 a barrel after Mr Trump’s tweet, a record intraday jump in percentage terms amounting to nearly 47 per cent. It settled $5.20 higher, a 21 per cent gain, at $29.94 a barrel   People close to the kingdom say the world’s biggest oil exporter still wants a deal on supply cuts, but any curbs would need to be shared between all major producers. Saudi Arabia, Russia and the US together account for around a third of global oil production.   Helima Croft at RBC Capital Markets said: “There is a realisation in Washington that the path to a deal runs through Moscow. Everyone knows that Saudi Arabia wants Russia at the table but there is also a recognition that the US will have to participate in some way. But there are clear questions about what the US’s involvement will look like.”  Riyadh had pushed for a deal to deepen and prolong production curbs ahead of a March meeting of oil ministers, but it was met with reluctance from Moscow. This prompted Saudi Arabia to pursue a “pump at will” strategy to shock the market, dramatically cutting prices for its crude and raising production to a record 12m barrels a day.   The flood of supplies are set to hit the market as the global oil industry faces its biggest consumption hit in history, with the coronavirus pandemic forcing lockdowns and travel bans. Traders are forecasting that crude demand could fall by as much as 30m b/d in April.  Some market analysts have said the demand collapse is so severe that any supply cuts from major producers would have a limited impact. Global storage tanks are already filling up and producer companies could be forced to shut-in oil projects.   The US has put pressure on Saudi Arabia to scale back its supply surge, which has contributed to a price collapse and ricocheted across the shale industry, where many companies are on the brink of bankruptcy.  While Saudi Arabia and Russia have said they backed joint efforts, until now there has been little sign of a strategy shift. Saudi Arabia has told the state energy company to prepare for a prolonged fight. Saudi Aramco has informed oilfield services contractors to be ready to provide support as it seeks to keep production at heightened levels.  Recommended The Commodities NoteAntoine Halff Saudi-Russia oil war is a game theory masterstroke  Russian energy minister Alexander Novak said on Thursday he did not “exclude the option of negotiations” with Saudi Arabia, but that the collapse in demand meant that cuts to supply would not necessarily prevent further oil price falls.  Complicating potential talks brokered by Mr Trump, Russia’s decision to abandon its alliance with Saudi Arabia was aimed partly at hurting US shale companies and the broader US economy. Washington has targeted the Russian energy industry through sanctions since 2014 in response to Moscow’s invasion of Crimea.  “The political hurdles to any supply deal are as large as the balance problem itself,” said analysts at JBC Energy.

71 infected with coronavirus at Sacramento church. Congregation tells county ‘leave us alone’

By Nathaniel Levine

17-22 minutes

One church in Sacramento County is now the epicenter of a major outbreak of coronavirus, and frustrated county officials say church leaders are refusing to listen to their demands to stop fellowship meetings.

Seventy-one members of the Bethany Slavic Missionary Church near Rancho Cordova or people associated with congregation members have been afflicted with the virus, county officials say, making this one of the larger outbreak clusters in the country. One parishioner has died, officials said, and the pastor is sick.

Sacramento health officials say they have made several attempts via phone and in person this week to talk to church leaders, but have been rebuffed. The cases involve residents of Yolo and Placer counties as well.

“They’ve basically told us to leave them alone,” Sacramento County health chief Dr. Peter Beilenson said on Thursday morning. “This is extremely irresponsible and dangerous for the community.”

Beilenson said the church has stopped its weekly main services, but church members have continued to meet in groups in people’s homes for fellowship meetings. Church officials have told a county nurse that those meetings are important in their community.

Beilenson and county officials say they are granting The Sacramento Bee’s request to reveal the name of the church to help warn other community members who associate with church congregants, in hopes that those people will stay away. Officials said they hope that public disclosure will put pressure on church members to stop their gatherings.

“This is a very serious public health matter,” Beilenson said.

Several church members, however, told The Bee they are in fact taking the virus matter seriously.

Church administrator Viktor Lyulkin said Thursday that all services had stopped more than two weeks ago, and that he was not aware of any small gatherings among church members in homes.

He also denied rebuffing county health officials.

“They contacted the office and we told them we have no services here,” he said. “It’s many, many calls.

“We’re looking to not spread the coronavirus.”

Church member Daniel Nechitaylo said the congregation initially began limiting meetings to small groups of 10 or fewer, but as far as he knows, those meetings stopped as well as people became aware of the seriousness of the virus. “We took it really seriously,” he said.

Bethany Slavic occupies a sprawling 20-acre plot of land on Jackson Road, just east of Bradshaw Road. Sacramento County property records show its buildings are roughly 150,000 square feet – roughly one-third the size of Sleep Train Arena.

Photographs on the church website show a worship hall packed with hundreds of people. Services are available in English and Russian.

Slavic churches stopped services

Nikolay Bugriyev, head of the Slavic International Pastors Association in Sacramento, which has 103 Slavic churches, said Bethany Slavic and all other churches stopped in-person services two weeks ago.

He and another Slavic community leader told The Bee that Bethany Slavic’s bishop, the Rev. Adam Bondaruk, has been hospitalized with coronavirus, as have other church officials.

But he said all the churches had obeyed orders to halt services.

”They stopped two weeks ago,” he said. “Two weeks ago when the order came, we stopped everywhere.”

Florin Ciuriuc, a Slavic community leader, said the church is the largest Slavic congregation in the United States, with 3,500 members and a total attendance at various services of up to 10,000 when children and friends are counted.

“They have people traveling from all kinds of states, they have visitors from everywhere,” he said.

He added that large churches all stopped having services, but that he has been hearing that some smaller operations may have quietly continued in small offices or homes.

Ciuriuc said he was so concerned he obtained a video of county officials, including Sacramento County District Attorney Anne Marie Schubert, ordering residents to shelter in place so he could impress upon some in his community the gravity of the situation.

”Some other pastors from (Bethany Slavic) are in the hospital, this is not a joke,” he said. “This is the most important time in my lifetime as a community leader.

”I feel that I need to be able to stop this religious fanaticism. God can hear me praying where I am right now. I don’t need to go to a place that’s prohibited.”

Ruslan Gurzhiy, a Sacramento journalist who runs a news site called Slavic Sacramento, in a Thursday interview with The Bee said he spent seven years as a volunteer at Bethany Slavic. He said members of the Sacramento Slavic community are “really religious.”

“The only place to gather, for them, is the church,” he said.

He also pointed out a major sanitary concern related to the church: Bethany Slavic’s special, monthly Pentecostal services involving mass sharing of church wine.

“There are 3,000 people drinking from a couple of chalices. They drink from one chalice — all hundreds of people.”

Another California church defies order

A church in Lodi is in a similar standoff with authorities, sending the city a “cease and desist” letter after police officers entered the church during a Wednesday evening service March 25.

A lawyer for Cross Culture Christian Center said the First Amendment protects the church’s right to hold services.

“The state simply does not have the jurisdiction to unilaterally shut down all church services indefinitely as Governor Gavin Newsom has done,” said attorney Dean Broyles of the National Center for Law & Policy, a San Diego organization devoted to religious freedom issues. “Under the U.S. Constitution, that important decision belongs to the discretion of the church alone.”

In the cease and desist letter, Broyles said the Lodi church “intends to continue to meet this Sunday and all future Wednesdays and Sundays.” He told The Bee that about 30 congregants were in attendance when police officers showed up. He said no church members have contracted COVID-19 “to our knowledge.”

Broyles added that Cross Culture put in place “recommended health and safety measures,” including social distancing, and advised its elderly and sick congregants to watch services on Facebook Live.

“With the health and safety standards we have put in place, we are a much lower risk of coronavirus spread than Walmart with its narrow aisles and everyone touching everything,” said Pastor Jon Duncan in a statement released by Broyles’ organization.

City spokesman Jeff Hood said officers followed up on their visit to the church this week by posting a “notice of public nuisance” on the church’s main entrance. The notice included references to the shutdown orders issued by Gov. Gavin Newsom and San Joaquin County.

Hood added that city officials have been huddling with the San Joaquin County counsel and district attorney “to ensure that the church complies with the order.” He wouldn’t elaborate on possible enforcement steps.

A constitutional law scholar at the McGeorge School of Law, Leslie Jacobs, said the state has broad powers to halt any large gatherings in an emergency like this. As far the churches are concerned, “the only right is to be treated equally, like everybody else,” she said. The fact all large gatherings have been prohibited gives the churches little room to maneuver legally, she said.

Jacobs said the government’s authority could wane as the crisis eases. “What happens if less of a spread (of the virus) is going on? Is it still permissible to prohibit services? This is an ongoing situation,” she said.
Clusters of coronavirus

The virus is highly contagious and a person can be carrying it for anywhere from two to 12 days before symptoms set in, according to Johns Hopkins University.

The virus cases at the church represent 22 percent of known coronavirus cases in the county. The county has reported 341 cases and nine deaths as of Wednesday.

County health officials said this week that one-third of coronavirus cases in Sacramento are tied to religious organizations.

The cluster of cases at the church is among the largest tied to a single group in the nation.

More than 100 people in the city of New Rochelle, outside New York City, were infected. Many of the cases were tied to an attorney and a synagogue he attended.

In Washington State, 45 people have coronavirus and two have died after members were infected at a church choir practice. About 20 people who attended a funeral in Albany, Georgia, were infected – and now nearly 500 people in the county have the virus. And several people who attended a Los Angeles-area birthday party at a golf club last month have the virus.

Closer to home, five members of the Faith Presbyterian Church in the Greenhaven neighborhood of Sacramento were infected. Two have died. But church officials note that they halted in-person church services after March 8 and fully shut down their buildings on March 12, one full week before Sacramento County officials issued a shelter-in-place order."

I have to admit that I am annoyed on almost every run by at least 1-2 pedestrians or cyclists (well, not real cyclists - just people who cycle on pavements) who use the pavement as if they own it. That said, if it's easy for me to step onto the road and cede the pavement as a runner, I do it. In a lot of situations, I think it's not easier for the runner to do this, for example if the cars are parked closely together. So many walkers don't seem to understand or care about this, and in my head it's a fairly basic courtesy since as a runner, I'm obviously actually doing something other than just getting from a to b.

It's really situational. We probably should be more understanding to non-runners, who might not like the idea of someone running towards them especially when sweating and breathing heavily (which yes, runners do more than walkers)."

Early contributions to biology were made by Catholic scientists such as Jean-Baptiste Lamarck and the Augustinian friar Gregor Mendel. Since the publication of Charles Darwin's On the Origin of Species in 1859, the attitude of the Catholic Church on the theory of evolution has slowly been refined. For nearly a century, the papacy offered no authoritative pronouncement on Darwin's theories. In the 1950 encyclical Humani generis, Pope Pius XII confirmed that there is no intrinsic conflict between Christianity and the theory of evolution, provided that Christians believe that God created all things and that the individual soul is a direct creation by God and not the product of purely material forces.

While constitutional reform might be his major goal, a good economy is how he stays in power. 

 What really worried me was when he made his minister of economic revitalization the head of the coronavirus task force. That is a very awkward conflict of interest at the moment.  Also not a good sign that he would skip out of coronavirus meetings after seven minutes so he could have dinner with business executives. 

 People have been bashing Trump for taking the side of big business and telling everybody they should go back to work soon for the sake of “the economy” (i.e., the interests of the wealthy, who hold stocks and have money on the table in business ventures). Unfortunately I don’t think Abe is fundamentally different from him in this attitude, just less loudmouthed about it.

 What these people can’t accept is that ultimately, a shut down is unavoidable. Putting it off increases not only deaths, but the length of time the inevitable shut down will have to take. The longer we put off doing this, the more harm it will do to the economy in the long run."

For your sake, I am glad you are still a virgin.  There is nothing worse than giving your soul (via sexual relations) to someone who doesn't appreciate/love you.  In order to find that person that is worthy of a sexual relationship, I recommend you take the time to find out your passions and learn to love yourself.  Find a mentor.  Someone you can be 100% honest with and will help you grow.  


> do not socialize

Take babysteps.  When this whole coronavirus thing is over, take enrichment classes.  Find out what you are interested in and build on that.  Keep learning.  Never stop learning....if you stop learning, you stop growing.  Take this time to write down things you've always wanted to do.  List them in order of how long you can accomplish those goals.  Make plans to take a trip."

You may have heard that surgical masks don’t work for preventing viral infections and may increase the risk of infection. Why is this? It is because people not accustomed to wearing masks can’t keep their hands off them. They constantly fiddle with them, adjust them, pull them down to talk and so on. Every time they do this, they are contaminating their mask with their hands, and if their hands have virus or bacteria on them, then they are risking infection.

(1) Start with a clean mask. If you are reusing a mask, make sure that you keep it clean when you are not wearing it.

(2) Wash your hands well with soap and water, for a minimum of 20 seconds but preferably more.

(3) Place your mask and get it adjusted perfectly. It may help to do this in front of a mirror.

(4) Now wash your hands again. You are doing this to protect everyone else since you have contaminated your hands by touching your face.

(5) Do not ever touch the mask or any part of your face again unless you repeat steps 2 to 4.

**THIS IS SO IMPORTANT!!!**

**ITS A GERM FACTORY ON YOUR FACE! DON'T TOUCH THE MASK!**

**Get one that fits you and doesn't slide around**

**Wear it around the house to get used to it before you go out in public and infect yourself and others!**"

Basically the Fed is propping up the table and hoping things are going to be keen and peachy once the beervirus is over and done with, when there was already liquidity problems existing in the market. Why shouldn't financial institutions be responsible for pulling liquidity from other equities rather than solely relying on the Fed to save their butts? In my opinion what the Fed has only done is to preserve capital intensive companies so they can continue to borrow without liquidating. In the end you keep the house of cards up instead of letting it topple because 2008 scared the fuck out of them so much that they figure infinite QE and 0 rates will stave it off, but what's going to eventually happen is the Fed is going to be left holding the bag when all the underlying issues come back to a head in the coming years.

Patrick Vallance stated off-the-cuff the facts around herd immunity, facts which still stand today, that until a vaccine exists, or the virus is eradicated (i.e. probably at least a year away, and “not going to happen”, respectively), 60% of the UK population would have to contract coronavirus in order for society to build up immunity and return the country to normality, and that inevitably herd immunity would be a path the country would be moving down during the outbreak.

Watching the daily press conferences, there were numerous occasions where Vallance and other non-politicians said something shocking and off-the-cuff and you could just see Boris thinking to himself “Jesus Christ, why the hell did you say that?!” They aren’t politicians and so aren’t used to withholding facts because those facts would just be too shocking to bluntly announce to the entire country on live TV.

Mere moments later of course every media media outlet had stories alluding that Patrick Vallance‘s comments were an announcement regarding a change in policy on behalf of the British government. And with the comments about herd immunity being factual, Vallance and co continued to discuss the concept when prompted, which fanned the flames. Matt Hancock even stated that herd immunity wasn’t part of the plan to fight the outbreak.

They had seen the outbreak in Wuhan, it was clear that letting the virus run rampant would be insane. It was never a policy on the table, just an observation made by a man who is used to speaking the facts, and the media ran with it as an actual Government announcement just because he said it while beside the Prime Minister.

What I am finding is that there just aren't that many, unlike the tens of thousands claimed by the CDC ""estimates.""  I found one [article on Idaho stats](https://www.eastidahonews.com/2018/01/5-people-died-flu-idaho-last-week-making-13-deaths-already-season/) (from Jan. 2018) that said that there average number of deaths from the flu is 23 and 2018 was really bad as they had 72 deaths.  Then there are [articles like this](https://patch.com/illinois/across-il/106-dead-flu-nationwide-outbreak-continues-illinois) which would make the CDC claim of 24,000-62,000 deaths seem outrageous.  We kept getting told how much worse the flu was, but if you look at actions vs. words, I think the [CDC's numbers](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/health/2020/02/01/coronavirus-flu-deadlier-more-widespread-than-wuhan-china-virus/4632508002/) are absolute bunk and we have all been buying their hype for too many years.  If we really had that many deaths every year, we would have had much more drastic measures in place to inhibit the spread.

Key points:

- Two labs in Wuhan are known for studying bat coronaviruses under low-security conditions.
- In Chinese labs similar to the ones in Wuhan, there have been incidents in which workers got infected with diseases from the lab, including a COVID-19-like SARS in 2004.
- One of the two labs is less than 300 meters from the wet market that is generally considered to be the source of the disease.

Lawmakers have pushed FDA to allow gay men to donate blood in recent weeks in light of Covid-19’s strain on the blood supply.

The revised guidelines also allow those who recently got tattoos or piercings to donate blood after waiting three months instead of a year, and allow former sex workers and injection drug users to donate after a three month deferral as well.

2:45 PM: Question period begins

**How are people going to be capable of paying their bills if this continues through the month?**

Governor: Congress has done what they can do to help. Look into the CARE Act and take advantage of any resources therein. We would not make these decisions if I did not feel it was a matter of life or death. We've got to keep this virus down. It's still alive and still fighting. A study of the Spanish Flu period, found that communities that let more people died, suffered more economically than those who took more precautions. 

Lieutenant Governor: We are still working on getting behind the logistics of giving people the resources they need from the CARE Act. We are not ignoring your suffering and we are trying to pull in every asset we can to solve your problems.
______________________________________________________________
**2:49 PM: Do we have enough coroners and other ""last responders?""**

Governor: We do not have enough equipment or staff and we are continuing to buy time to get what we need. 
________________________________________________________________________________
**2:51 PM: How many have recovered would you say? What is your current estimate of how many are likely infected with the virus?**

Amy Acton: We are doing our best to track that. We will be working with data on those who were hospitalized. For the general population, it is nearly impossible to measure those recovered.

We still do not have enough tests to guess how many are infected with the virus in Ohio. There is still asymptomatic spread. My expectations on how many are infected comes from the fact that between 40% and 70% will likely be infected with coronavirus by the end of this. 
___________________________________________________________________________
**2:54 PM: Will the Dispute resolution Team have the force of law and will there be a repeal process?**

Governor: It will have the force of law and there will not be a repeal process. We will follow current laws on how public this will be

Lieutenant Governor: The order states that their ruling is final.
________________________________________________
**2:56 PM: Do you expect social distancing guidelines to increase?**

Amy Acton: Six feet is a fair number based on traditional spread based on droplets. Keep washing your hands and stay away from others as much as possible if you think you are sick. 
________________________________________________________________________
**2:58 PM: What are companies doing to keep their employees safe, both in terms of health and in terms of wages?**

Lieutenant Governor: Many of the employers we have spoken to encourage the use of masks. They are doing what they can to keep people safe. At least one business is offering a 30% wage increase for those who are willing to work for them.

Governor: We encourage companies to allow masks to be worn. Larger companies that are working to buy masks for employees have not found sources of masks as of yet but they are still working on that. 
_____________________________________________________________________________________
**3:02 PM: Do you have any sense of turnaround for new PPE production?**

Governor: We're still working with the companies on that. We're trying to find supplies and build up capacity in our own state to get prioritized delivery. 

Lieutenant Governor: It is typically a 9 month process to change what is being produced. They are working at light-speed. I want to add that all of these businesses are going to be lifesavers and thank them.
_______________________________________________________________
**3:04 PM: Question on recovery numbers**

Amy Acton: I'm going to try to get those for you. I've been speaking to my team about the best way to get those numbers. 
______________________________________________
**3:06 PM: What are your thoughts on what can be done to protect those at risk for domestic violence?**

Governor: There is a concern for both domestic violence and child abuse. I'm not sure what we can do as of yet.
_____________________________________________________________
**3:08 PM: What signs are you looking for to say that we're safe?**

Amy Acton: It will definitely be a slow way back down. All scientists are saying that opening back up will have to be a delicate operation. We must have testing, we'll need better models, we'll need our hospitals to be stable and supplied, we'll need robust contact tracing for immediate quarantine, the numbers would also have to stabilize and be low. Other countries have waited until the numbers are near zero to remove their mitigations. 
_____________________________________________________________________________
**3:11 PM: What are the statewide protocols for health care workers? Are you disallowing makeup or ensuring that facial hair is shaved? Would you see this as a benefit?**

Amy Acton: We are receiving recommendations from the CDC and will be working on getting that information out as far as possible. The CDC guidance changes daily but we believe it will be stabilizing soon so that we can keep protocols the same. This would definitely be a benefit to the state.
________________________________________________________________________________
**3:14 PM: Are we to the point of discussing a universal DNR in hospitals?**

Amy Acton: Everything we're doing is to prevent our health care workers from having to make difficult ethical decisions. We must ensure that no one is being marginalized by these decisions. 
____________________________________________________________________
**3:16 PM: Can you shed any light on those who have died so far? Did they have pre-existing health conditions?**

Amy Acton: We are still getting data on that. Even obesity can be a major issue for those who get the virus. Anyone can react badly to illness.
__________________________________________________________________________________
**3:18 PM: What do you say to frustrated Ohioans?**

Governor: I'm frustrated too. I don't think there is a single person in Ohio that isn't frustrated. This isn't what we signed up for. This is where we are right now though. i just want to make it through this. We are basing our decisions on the best science and expert advice.
_______________________________________________________________________________________
**3:21 PM: What are you doing about quality control?** 

Governor: The people who are finding this equipment are looking into that issue. 

3:22 PM: Question period ends
__________________________________________________________________________________
3:22 PM: The Governor starts speaking

We will be showing a video by the Ohio Department of Transportation, who are lighting up our bridges with red, white, and blue. I'd like to thank all of our ODoT workers.

By [Jay Greene](https://www.washingtonpost.com/people/jay-greene/) April 2, 2020 at 3:47 p.m. PDT

SEATTLE — Amazon’s top legal executive suggested the company’s senior leaders fend of workplace safety criticism by trying to turn the focus on an activist warehouse worker [it had fired](https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2020/03/30/worker-strike-instacart-amazon-whole-foods/?tid=lk_inline_manual_2&itid=lk_inline_manual_2) just days earlier, according to leaked notes from a meeting with top executives.

The company fired Chris Smalls, a New York warehouse worker, on Monday after he complained to several media outlets, including The Washington Post, that Amazon had not done enough to protect its workforce during the [coronavirus](https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2020/02/28/what-you-need-know-about-coronavirus/?tid=lk_inline_manual_3&itid=lk_inline_manual_3) pandemic. In an email recounting a meeting with senior executives, including chief executive Jeff Bezos, executives discussed a strategy to shift the focus to Smalls. (Bezos owns The Post.)

“He’s not smart, or articulate, and to the extent the press wants to focus on us versus him, we will be in a much stronger PR position than simply explaining for the umpteenth time how we’re trying to protect workers,” Amazon General Counsel David Zapolsky wrote in an email first obtained by the [news site Vice](https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/5dm8bx/leaked-amazon-memo-details-plan-to-smear-fired-warehouse-organizer-hes-not-smart-or-articulate). The Washington Post confirmed the authenticity of the email.

When Amazon fired Smalls, it said it did so after he ignored a request from his manager to stay home because of his contact with a worker who tested positive for covid-19. Smalls called the firing “retaliation” for speaking out against the company.

In a statement, Zapolsky called his comments in the leaked email “personal and emotional.”

“I was frustrated and upset that an Amazon employee would endanger the health and safety of other Amazonians by repeatedly returning to the premises after having been warned to quarantine himself after exposure to virus Covid-19,” Zapolsky said. “I let my emotions draft my words and get the better of me.”

At least two executives on Amazon’s most senior leadership team in the daily meeting executed on Zapolsky’s strategy Tuesday and Wednesday. Amazon senior vice president of operations Dave Clark and senior vice president of global corporate affairs Jay Carney both mocked [a tweet from Sen. Bernie Sanders](https://twitter.com/BernieSanders/status/1245113355582550021) (I-Vt.), who called Smalls’s firing “disgraceful.” Both [Clark ](https://twitter.com/davehclark/status/1245156275869999104)and [Carney ](https://twitter.com/JayCarney/status/1245474780746330119)put the focus on Smalls, saying he “purposely violated social distancing rules.”

Sanders, a frequent critic of Amazon’s treatment of its workers, wasn’t alone among politicians criticizing Amazon’s firing of Smalls. A few hours after Amazon terminated Smalls, New York Attorney General Letitia James (D) called the move “disgraceful,” asked the National Labor Relations Board to investigate the incident, said she is “considering all legal options.”

Amazon continues to [wrestle with the havoc](https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2020/03/17/amazons-warehouse-workers-sound-alarms-about-coronavirus-spread?tid=lk_inline_manual_18&itid=lk_inline_manual_18) the coronavirus has wreaked on its operations. Employees in at least 28 Amazon warehouse and shipping facilities across the United States have [tested positive for covid-19](https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2020/03/24/amazon-warehouse-workers-coronavirus-positive/?tid=lk_inline_manual_18&itid=lk_inline_manual_18), according to Amazon, its warehouse workers and local media reports.

Even so, Amazon said it has already hired for 80,000 of the 100,000 new jobs it announced a little more than two weeks ago. The company is racing to hire employees, who will work in Amazon’s warehouses and deliver its packages, to unclog [the crush of orders](https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2020/03/24/amazon-prime-deliveries-coronavirus/?tid=lk_inline_manual_19&itid=lk_inline_manual_19) the company has received from customers leery of leaving their homes to shop."

But, with Mandetta unwilling to back down, Bolsonaro’s closest aides refused to support his plan to relax coronavirus rules to keep the economy going, according to two sources with knowledge of the meeting. 

Elected two years ago on a promise to revive growth, Bolsonaro has shocked health experts around the world by persistently playing down the gravity of the epidemic, calling COVID-19 “a little cold” exaggerated by the media and his opponents - even after his political idol U.S. President Donald Trump walked back his own skepticism about the outbreak. 

The sources said senior ministers, including high-profile Justice Minister Sergio Moro, sided with Mandetta on the imperative to reinforce social distancing and put the public health crisis before concerns over paralyzing the economy. 

Even top military officers in the government - who until now have neither publicly criticized nor defended Bolsonaro - sprang to Mandetta’s defense. 

In a thinly veiled rebuke to Bolsonaro, Presidential Chief of Staff Walter Braga, an active duty Army general, said Mandetta’s departure from the cabinet was out of the question."

It isn't so much about Arielle as much as what she represents. Everything she did is just the embodiment of selfishness. You had coronavirus...yet you were around your children, your nanny, your family, your 60+ parents, and potentially spread it to the people in your building as well as a smaller, less equipped community. For me it isn't even a wealth thing it is just a sense of entitlement Arielle and so many seem to have. Their comfort/lives/routines are more important than everyone else's so they can go to the Hamptons or wherever while we all stay home and try to flatten the curve.

I really don't think she would have even acknowledged it further had it not been covered my so many media outlets at this point. I don't genuinely believe she is remorseful or regrets her decision. She was content to keep posting pics in her $500 sweatsuits and disabling comments until it ""blew over"". Once she saw this wasn't going away then she finally addressed it. For f-s sake I think my friend is going to have PTSD after having Covid. She went through some terrifying physical symptoms and she was also laid off. But yes, Arielle, please link us to the jumpsuit you paired with your Chanel boots. If she had come out and said ""look, I fucked up big time. I wasn't thinking clearly and went into full panic mode. I know I was inconsiderate and made the wrong decision. I don't blame you for being mad/disappointed/etc."" that would be one thing...but there was nothing but PR spin and fake tears.

That story about the people in the town over from you is infuriating. I'm sorry that happened so close by. I really don't know what it is going to take for some people to take this seriously. My neighbors still come and go multiple times a day, every day, and have people stop over. My MILs friend just went to a fitness class at a local rec center. Isn't potentially saving a life more important than you having happy hour? It is so angering. Also sorry this response is like a mile long...I clearly have some feelings about all this 😂."

""Americans pay three or four times the amount we pay, and in cash,"" said Jean Rottner, head of France's eastern region, one of the areas worst affected by the coronavirus outbreak, [according to reports by France Info.](http://www.francetvinfo.fr/sante/maladie/coronavirus/coronavirus-des-masques-commandes-par-la-france-rachetes-sur-le-tarmac-par-les-americains_3895897.html)

On Thursday, a planeload of Chinese-made face masks were bought up right on the tarmac just as the much needed protective gear was about to set off for France.

""We're working around the clock to ensure these masks arrive,"" says Rottner, blaming unfair competition for delays. 

The United States, which now has the highest number of known cases of coronavirus in the world, is trying to procure any masks available, disrupting deliveries to other nations, [another report by French daily Liberation](http://www.liberation.fr/france/2020/04/01/une-commande-francaise-de-masques-detournee-vers-les-etats-unis-sur-un-tarmac-chinois_1783805) indicated.

The east of France nonetheless received 2 million masks from China on Wednesday, to the delight of its president.

""I was very happy to see that airplane arriving in our region last night,"" Rottner said.

France has ordered [more than one billion face masks,](http://www.rfi.fr/en/france/20200330-100-tonnes-medical-supplies-15-million-face-masks-from-china-arrives-in-france-coronavirus-covid-19) a quarter from China, as it battles the pandemic and currently has less than [three weeks worth of supplies.](http://www.reuters.com/article/health-coronavirus-france/france-has-ordered-over-1-billion-face-masks-most-from-china-minister-idUSL8N2BL0KY)

**Mask shortage cover up**

At the end of last month, French President Emmanuel Macron insisted the country needed to regain its ""independence"" in producing vital medical equipment, without relying excessively on imports.

Macron hopes to [rebuild ""national sovereignty""](http://www.france24.com/en/20200331-macron-announces-push-to-produce-coronavirus-masks-ventilators) by the end of 2020. However, according to reports by French online investigative website Mediapart, the government knew about dwindling medical stocks as early as January.

The health ministry, aware of the limited supplies, decided to order only a small amount of masks, despite internal warnings, writes Mediapart.

[The news site says](http://www.mediapart.fr/journal/france/020420/masques-les-preuves-d-un-mensonge-d-etat?utm_source=20200402&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=ALERTE&utm_content=&utm_term=&xtor=EREC-83-[ALERTE]-20200402&M_BT=1223719830523) the government knowingly covered up the shortage of masks for over two months, changing its health advice accordingly. Initially, the director of health insisted [any person in contact with a coronavirus patient wear a mask,](http://www.rfi.fr/en/international/20200329-to-mask-or-not-to-mask-mixed-messages-in-a-time-of-coronavirus-crisis-france-covid-19-spread-droplets) but as stocks began to dwindle, he made a U-turn and insisted it was no longer necessary.

The limited supplies have left health officials and [those at the frontline of the crisis exposed.](http://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2020/03/going-war-butter-knife/608428/) All eyes will be on government policy when the lockdown period comes to an end. Deputy economy minister Agnès Pannier-Runacher has admitted that the state will have to ""massively equip the population,"" according to Mediapart.

**Intense struggle**

In the meantime, lower-level officials are following in Rottner's footsteps and taking the matter into their own hands. The head of the south-eastern Provence-Alpes-Côte d’Azur region [Renaud Muselier told RT France ](http://www.globalvillagespace.com/after-blaming-us-bought-france-bound-face-masks-from-china/)that he ordered around 60 million masks but has also experienced delivery problems.

To ensure the delivery of 4 million masks by this Saturday, Muselier has opted for a different route, passing by the sea instead. ""At least that way, I can be sure that no one will steal my masks from the tarmac,"" he said.

The United States, like France, has come under criticism for its lack of preparedness in dealing with Covid-19. However, its covert efforts to make up the shortfall of masks is also being called into question.

Logistically speaking, taking different routes is ""an intense struggle,"" said Muselier."

>Now [COVID-19] is [here], and we have to figure out how to combat that, too. I’m an entrepreneur. In general, negative responses don’t work. I obviously think that being racist is not a good thing. But saying “Don’t be racist toward Asians” won’t work.

>I have been thinking about ways to improve that [racist] encounter at the grocery store. People are hurting. They look up and see someone who is different from them, whom they wrongly associate with the upheaval of their way of life.   

>[...]  

>During World War II, Japanese Americans volunteered for military duty at the highest possible levels to demonstrate that they were Americans. Now many in the Asian American community are stepping up, trying to demonstrate that we can be part of the solution. Some 17 percent of U.S. doctors are Asian and rushing to the front lines.  

>We Asian Americans need to embrace and show our American-ness in ways we never have before. We need to step up, help our neighbors, donate gear, vote, wear red white and blue, volunteer, fund aid organizations, and do everything in our power to accelerate the end of this crisis. We should show without a shadow of a doubt that we are Americans who will do our part for our country in this time of need.  

Yang sounds a lot like my parents and other 1st generation Asian Americans. For them, the way to counter racism is to prove how good we are at being model citizens. It's also an approach I think a lot of 2nd generation Asians are familiar with using growing up. For a lot of us, our experience tells us this approach isn't helpful. Yang's own example of Japanese Americans in World War II proves it isn't. High volunteering rates couldn't save their friends and family from being interned.  

This approach to prejudice also explains Yang's campaign. Talking about being an Asian guy who's good with numbers, why he obviously knows a lot of doctors, and all the positive stereotypes he's leaned into makes complete sense if his goal is to be as model of a minority candidate as he can. Considering he grew up in Upstate New York, I can see why his personal experience might lead him to that approach to politics. But to pharaphrase Eleanor Young, we will never be enough."

Mr Trudeau says he is 'very concerned' over reports supplies meant for Canada have been diverted

Canada is investigating reports a shipment of medical supplies the country had ordered was diverted to the US.

Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said he is ""very concerned"", adding that ""we need to make sure that \[coronavirus\] equipment that is destined for Canada gets to and stays in Canada.

""And I've asked ministers to follow up on these particular reports.

""We are working not just here at home but overseas; as well, to ensure that the equipment that Canada has ordered makes its way to Canada.""

Coronavirus has claimed the lives of more than 125 Canadians, while more than 10,000 have fallen ill.

Mr Trudeau told reporters on Thursday he has asked his public safety minister and transport minister to investigate, but stressed the country's relationship with its neighbour to the south has not changed.

""We are working together \[with US officials\]. We understand that the needs of the United States are real, but the needs of Canada are also real. And we need to work together to that end,"" he added.

A top health official in France's hard-hit eastern region pointed the finger at Washington.

Dr Jean Rottner, an emergency room doctor in Mulhouse, told RTL radio American officials swooped on a Chinese airport to take away a planeload of masks that France had ordered.

""On the tarmac, the Americans arrive, take out cash and pay three or four times more for our orders, so we really have to fight.""

Almost 200,000 masks are heading to New York, the epicentre of the infection in the US, courtesy of the Justice Department.

It is distributing about 192,000 N-95 masks as well as gloves, gowns, hand sanitiser and other personal protective equipment seized by the new coronavirus hoarding and price gouging task force.

The supplies, found by the FBI on Monday, will go to frontline medical workers in New York and New Jersey.

The justice department says it notified the department of health and human services, which compelled the supplies be turned over as part of the Defense Production Act.

Agents also found nearly 600,000 medical-grade gloves, 130,000 surgical masks, some N100 masks and disinfectant spray and towels.

Authorities said the owner would be paid ""fair market value"" for the supplies."

But it states that cloth-based masks that people seem so fond of promoting allowed 97% of particles through compared to 44% of Medical Masks when tested against 17 respiratory viruses:

>Laboratory confirmation was by nucleic acid detection using multiplex reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR) for 17 respiratory viruses: respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) A and B, human metapneumovirus (hMPV), influenza A (H3N2), (H1N1)pdm09, influenza B, parainfluenza viruses 1–4, influenza C, rhinoviruses, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV), coronaviruses 229E, NL63, OC43 and HKU1, adenoviruses and human bocavirus (hBoV).

*IF* this is true (the study also talks about the lack of studies in association with cloth masks), should we still be telling people or requiring people to wear cloth-based masks?

I've been wearing one when I need to go out........ moist breath still escapes the cloth mask through the top and bottom of the mask anyway. I say that because if I'm asymptomatic, particles are *still* escaping and there's no reason to believe that the study's finding of 97% particle penetration in cloth masks is one-way.

Not against masks, but I don't feel comfortable getting surgical masks or any other medical mask for myself while hospitals are still short on supply.

And it anyone has a newer study contradicting the one above, please let me know. I want to be as informed as possible."

The Peter principle is a concept in management developed by Laurence J. Peter, which observes that people in a hierarchy tend to rise to their ""level of incompetence"": an employee is promoted based on their success in previous jobs until they reach a level at which they are no longer competent, as skills in one job do not necessarily translate to another. The concept was elucidated in the 1969 book The Peter Principle by Dr Peter and Raymond Hull.

The Peter Principle was published by William Morrow and Company in 1969. Peter and Hull intended the book to be satire, but it became popular as it was seen to make a serious point about the shortcomings of how people are promoted within hierarchical organizations.

So what does Far-Right have to do with the Coronavirus ? Well for the initial few months the Coronavirus was tossed around as not a big deal. We also have the 'it's China's fault' narrative (since it originated from there).

The world passes one million confirmed cases of COVID-19.  Of those, 5% have already died and 20% have recovered.  75% of confirmed cases were confirmed in the last 14 days.  The rate is exponential, doubling in 7 days. About 4% are listed in serious or critical condition.  No country in the world has found the natural exhaustion of the contagion.  Either it is stopped or it continues to an end none of us can foresee.  The worst affected country over one million population, Spain, has less than three confirmed cases per thousand people so far. The number infected but unconfirmed remains unknown. About one in eleven cases in Spain have died, and many more are ill. We may have a very long way to go.

The global economy is shutting down at an unprecedented rate. 

The US has the highest number of confirmed cases in the world, nearly 1/4th of the world total, and is doubling at nearly twice the global pace.  Over 5,000 Americans have died.  Unemployment has touched one in six American workers already, last week's new claims alone more than ten times the record number standing just a few weeks prior.

We stand in a historic moment.  We will get through this.  Life will go on.  But not one of us will go untouched.  We must bear it.  Help each other get through.  Be kind.

I think when this is all said and done, we'll realize this is an illness about as bad as the flu with a similar death rate. 

The danger is this: we have no vaccine, which protects billions from the flu each year, and we have no treatment (ie, you take tamiflu for the flu). Most people have also already had a version of the flu. 

So imagine it *is* ""only as bad as the flu"". It's an illness on par with the flu that's much more contagious, we have no treatment for, and no vaccine for. Our medical systems across the globe are equipped to handle the flu. They aren't equipped to handle the flu and something equally deadly and more contagious. 

And honestly, it's still likely that the death rate is higher than the flu, even if only slightly.

I recommend you give a listen to that. From an actual reputable source + Lidia Oostvogels, who researches infectious diseases with the German biotech company CureVac and she talks about Trump trying to buy the company.

https://www.politico.eu/article/trump-coronavirus-vaccine-germany-curevac/

Give that a read (but I’m sure you won’t do I’ll summarize the important bit)

> German pharmaceutical company CureVac insists it did not receive any offer from U.S. President Donald Trump to secure exclusive rights to a potential coronavirus vaccine, despite the German government and the company’s main investor saying it did.

-  (Of course the company wouldn’t mention it, but when the government is saying yes then it’s obvious who’s lying) 

> But Haas, in a one-hour news conference carried out by telephone, failed to explain why senior German ministers had confirmed — and strongly condemned — such a bid, and why even the company’s main investor, Dietmar Hopp, said Monday that he had been informed about a U.S. offer which he then rejected.

- Haas (the CEO) failed to tell a good explanation as to why their main investor said Trump did try to buy them. 

> He [Hopp, the company investor] added, “[Trump] spoke to the company and they immediately told me and asked me what I thought about it, and I knew immediately that this was out of the question.”

- the investor says he spoke to Trump

> Chancellor Angela Merkel told reporters on Monday that the German government “has dealt very early on” with Trump’s reported takeover attempt. She said, in reference to Hopp’s statement, that the issue had now been “resolved.”

- Angela Merkel confirmed it. 

So what’s more probable, the company denying it to not get into trouble and backlash, or the German government’s and investors of CureVac being part of the “dEeP STatE” to make trump look bad"

Globally, moderate-to-severe cases have occurred in 10% to 15% of adults under age 50, according to the World Health Organization.

> On Friday at Manhattan's Mount Sinai Morningside Hospital, a previously healthy 32-year-old male patient turned to doctor Kaedrea Jackson and asked: “Am I going to die?”

> The young man, who had no underlying medical conditions, was short of breath with a fever, and his oxygen levels were dropping rapidly. He’d come to the hospital’s emergency department four days earlier but was told to go home, drink water, take Tylenol and self-isolate. Now he was back and his condition was deteriorating. “The level of fear in his eyes stood out to me,” Jackson, an emergency medicine physician, recalled in an interview Tuesday. “He was extremely scared. And he was so young.”

> “It’s young folks, previously healthy,” said Eric Wei, an emergency room doctor and chief quality officer at NYC Health + Hospitals, the city’s public hospital system.  “They look like they have the flu. Within hours, they need oxygen. Within a few more hours they need a ventilator.” 

> At NYU Langone Health’s Medical Center overlooking the East River in Manhattan, dozens of patients in intensive care last week were under age 50, according to a worker who was providing direct medical care to them. A handful were in their 20s, and one was just 7 years old. The hospital declined to provide exact numbers of Covid-19 patients, details about their ages or whether they had underlying health conditions, citing patient privacy.

> For even the youngest patients, doctors have to use ventilators set to high pressure, pumping in high levels of oxygen.

> “Many will end up with damaged lungs and thereafter may be constrained in the future,’’ he said. “Any respiratory illness will make you sick, because you don’t have reserves, and things like running cross country or doing a 5K race may be out. You may not be able to be as active because your lungs don’t have the capacity anymore.”

I'm not sure how many ventilators an aircraft carrier has, but I'm going to assume medical staff on board would have to start conducting triages.

2020-04-02,PolitiFactReddit,Coronavirus,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/fto4y5/politifact_is_here_on_international_factchecking/fm86dob/,"Hi there, this is Daniel, a misinformation reporter for PolitiFact. This is a great question — and a lot of the confusion has to do with how public health officials have waffled on their guidance on using face masks to prevent the spread of COVID-19.

Yesterday, we published a story about whether using homemade face masks is as effective as using surgical masks. In it, I wrote about how public health officials are considering whether to change their guidance on masks. As of now, the CDC says only people who are sick, or caring for someone who is, need to wear a mask. That guidance may soon change to include any healthy people who go out in public.

Why? Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, has said one of the best ways Americans can avoid infecting others — even if they aren’t showing any coronavirus symptoms — is to wear a surgical mask. But with shortages around the country, it’s hard for even health care workers to get them. 

So until there is a reliable supply of surgical masks, health officials are reticent to recommend that people wear them, because that guidance may worsen the shortage and take protection away from health care workers.

TL;DR: Research shows that surgical and homemade masks are effective at preventing the spread of COVID-19. But health officials haven't advised people to wear them because there is a national shortage, and health care workers need them more than anyone.

> Doctors are reporting they now understand the behavior of the COVID 19 virus due to autopsies that they have carried out. This virus is characterized by obstructing respiratory pathways with thick mucus that solidifies and blocks the airways and lungs. So they have discovered that in order to apply a medicine you have to open and unblock these airways so that the treatment can be used to take effect however all of this takes a number of days. Their recommendations for what you can do to safeguard yourself are ...

>1) Drink lots of hot liquids - coffees, soups, teas, warm water. In addition take a sip of warm water every 20 minutes bc this keeps your mouth moist and washes any of the virus that’s entered your mouth into your stomach where your gastric juices will neutralize it before it can get to the lungs.  
2) Gargle with an antiseptic and warm water like vinegar or salt or lemon every day if possible  
3) The virus attaches itself to hair and clothes. And detergent or soap kills it but you must take bath or shower when you get in from the street. Avoid sitting down in your home and go straight to the shower. If you cannot wash your clothes daily, hang them in sunlight which also helps to neutralize the virus  
4) Wash metallic surfaces very carefully bc the virus can stay viable on these for up to 9 days. Take note and be vigilant about touching hand rails, door knobs, etc. and keep these clean in home home  
5) Don’t smoke  
6) Wash your hands every 20 minutes with any soap that foams and do this for 20 seconds  
7) Eat fruits and vegetables. Try to elevate your zinc levelS  
8)Animals do not spread the virus to people. Its a person to person transmission.  
9)Try to avoid getting the common flu as this already weakens your system and try to avoid eating and drinking any cold things.  
10) If you feel any discomfort in your throat or a sore throat coming on, attack it immediately using the above methods. The virus enters the system through the throat but will sit in the throat for 3-4 days before it passes into your lungs.

I find it really weird that there have been three deadly coronaviruses outbreaks in the past 20 years: COVID-19, MERS, and SARS. I understand coronaviruses are pretty common and are behind things like the common cold. But if this is the case, why have all of these bad outbreaks occurred in such a short time frame? 

If COVID-19 was a truly new unique disease that would actually make a lot more sense to me as it would represent a random one-off Black Swan type event. But the past 20 years suggest something has changed and the emergence of deadly coronaviruses is a new normal—which is both troubling and does not seem to have an obvious explanation.

I’ve come up with the possible explanations below, but all seem pretty flawed to me: 

· It is possible that in the past there have other deadly coronavirus outbreaks that went unnoticed. However, I would think that since at least 1950 they would have been identified. And 50 years of no bad outbreaks followed by three in 20 years seems unlikely. 

· Increased population and urban population density probably increase the odds of deadly coronaviruses outbreaks over time. But going from none for 50 years to three in 20 years seems statistically improbable. 

· There is an argument that increased human expansion into new ecosystems is resulting in the emergence of new diseases. While this makes a lot of sense for truly new diseased like HIV or ebola, coronaviruses are not exactly new. Also these deadly coronaviruses emerged in China and the Middle East – places with a long history of human habitation and where much of the natural environment was destroyed centuries ago.

· The exotic animal trade is also identified as a mechanism for the emergence of new diseases, but again the trade in exotic animals isn’t a new phenomenon. While I could see higher levels of trade over the past 20 years increasing the odds of more outbreaks, it doesn’t explain the absence of any previous outbreaks. 

Anyhow, I am curious if anyone has seen any good studies or their own ideas that might offer a better explanation for what is driving this apparent change in deadliness coronaviruses outbreaks."

You can keep doing CPR en route, but the longer you go without a pulse the more intensive care you will incur (read: the more organ damage to kidneys, brain, heart) and the lesser your quality of life you will have on the chance that you survive.  People do survive this kind of thing, but it takes extended intensive care.  These types of patients do not make up a huge proportion of calls, but do take a significant amount of life saving measures including ICU beds and ventilators only to rarely survive or have minimal quality of life if they do.

I was lucky enough to see Rachel and Adam live in London last year and it was one of my favourite ever gigs. A highlight of that night was 
Rachel and Adam’s mash up of Stacy’s Mom and Fuck Me Ray Bradbury: https://youtu.be/91hXCqeO6nk

Out of all the songs I love from Crazy Ex Girlfriend, my absolute favourite is probably What’ll It Be: https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=HayIkHCXTBM. It’s such a clever Billy Joel parody that still manages to be completely its own thing and completely true to Greg’s character, which means that, really, it’s not actually a parody at all. And that probably sums up how I feel about many of the CExG songs. I especially love Adam’s demo version that Aline shared on Twitter today: https://twitter.com/alinebmckenna/status/1245497459360452608

I feel so saddened by Adam’s death; he was way too young and he still had so much great music to give. Special shout out to That Thing You Do which I adore and didn’t realise was written by him until today! I can’t even imagine how Rachel is feeling after such a desperately emotional week. I keep thinking about Adam’s daughters who had every right to expect another couple of decades with their dad. 

This virus is evil and unfair and terrible; this is the first death by coronavirus of someone I feel like I ‘knew’, even though of course I didn’t know him at all. I guess it’s because so much of CExG feels really personal to me; a lot of my own struggle is reflected in the journey Rebecca takes and it’s probably the first time I ever really felt truly *seen* by something on my TV. I live with a severe chronic illness that causes me a great deal of pain and I turn to the show again and again when it’s too much to bear. It makes me feel safe and has never failed to make me smile. 

I think it would be really great if there were something we as a fandom could do to remember Adam in the weeks and months ahead of fighting coronavirus. I’m based in the U.K. so I’m not so familiar with the US, but maybe we could fundraise to support the medical staff who treated him in New York? Maybe something like buying coffees for all the staff at the hospital in his name or something? I don’t know, that’s probably a totally naff idea and it would be great if someone else came up with some better ones, but if anyone is up for it I’d love to do something positive to remember him. 

I’m so glad to have this community today as I don’t know anyone in ‘real’ life who loves the show like I do. Thank you everyone for being here and sharing - it’s a really lovely tribute to the difference Adam’s work made to all of us."

Local governments have implemented other restrictions but have said only the state can impose a stay at home order. Little Rock and at least two other cities are enforcing nighttime curfews in response to the outbreak.

Cities have taken further steps, including removing basketball goals and taping off playground equipment.

Trump’s actions are focused solely on creating a positive perception in the minds of his unwavering base—outcomes are meaningless to him as he utilizes Steve Bannon’s information warfare tactic called [“flood the zone with shit”](https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2020/1/16/20991816/impeachment-trial-trump-bannon-misinformation) to obfuscate the material consequences of his decisions.

Without testing, how can anybody collect sufficient data to determine the risk of human-to-human transmission, rate of spread, and so on?  

> self imposed travel restrictions

Is this reasonable to expect? Today, the United States has the most number of coronavirus cases in the world, meaning that Americans flying out of the US have a higher probability of spreading the virus. Do you expect the US government to impose self-impose travel restrictions forbidding US citizens from leaving America? This type decision is difficult for large countries like America, and China, to do. 

>  Let's not forget it took them nearly two months to take action.

Imagine if a dozen people in a hospital in say, Houston, fell sick with flu like symptoms during flu season. How long does it take for this to raise alarms in Washington? Is it fair to expect the government to act the minute the first patient was hospitalized? When nobody even knew a new virus even existed?"

It also said they refuse to speak to owners until the government makes an announcement about rent reform. 

I know that the owner of the house is able to reduce the rent. The previous tenants paid $50 less per week, plus they had gardening included (which I don’t have). Further, the owner is employed by the QLD government and bought the house well over a decade ago. So.

Wrong. Being against medical marijuana is another issue he invests into.

>He's Jewish and he supports whoever that supports Israel.

Add any ethnic group and any country into your comment and you would be making a surface level point that is incorrect. I'm an American and i don't support Trump. Many Americans are like that.

>However, his political affiliation should not take away from the generosity he's shown towards those who works for him and the community.

The policies and organization he supports is what is turning him from an oligarch setting public precedence to a hero to Las Vegas. Its the framing.

He's doing what we should have been taxing him all along to do? Then you turn around and praise him?

>What he's doing, through his company, for his employees and the Las Vegas community as a whole during this Coronavirus crisis is absolutely amazing and commendable.

You sound like you work for a PR firm for him. Wow one of the richest men in the world is doing what every company should be doing, but vast majority do not. So why again are we allowing these oligarchs to make the decision to have enough sympathy to do the correct thing? They should of been taxed appropriately and their influence by lobbiest removed and allow our government to actually function instead of being beholden to the corporate parties.

>Just like how someone's not automatically a lazy freeloader because they're Democrats, someone's not automatically evil because they're Republican.

Calling a democrat a freeloader is laughable interpretation at best, the existence of Liberal cities, saw thats a poor characterization.

But what do you call a party who supports every war, every regime change operation across the world, being for 30k people dying a year to curable dieseases, being for medical bankruptcies, supports lobbiest in politics, supports money being fine for influence in our government, being fine with austerity, and this can go on forever... How is that is anyway, not evil?

The democrats maybe freeloaders but the republican platform is definitely evil.

>And just to highlight some of the things he's liberal on, he's pro environment (The Venetian hired people to literally sort through all the trash and recycle what can be recycled),

Pro environment =/= make the world worse through supported policies but do somethings to help.

What you are suggesting is like. Spitting into a small pond that you are draining and then turning around and saying you're helping the issue because you added water one day.

Pro environment is being consistent with who you support in congress. Republicans are not arbitrators of helping the environment. The biggest polluters in the world are corporations and vehicles that work for them, which Addelson supports.

>pro choice, pro stem cell research, pro immigration (he supports the Dreamers),

All those liberal things he supports is liberal social policies which most Americans believe anyways. If you support social policies which cost a billionaire nothing but support financially an organization that fights those same liberal policies you support means... *drum roll* you do not actually support those policies. So here is the key thing you need to learn.

Billionaires use philanthropy and socialist based policies to improve their PR and allows them to think they aren't such terrible people since they get people like you defending every move they have done when in reality, billionaires should of never had that kind of power, privilege and the ability to change the course of human history with your wealth that 99 to 1 odds was gotten through ill-means or taken from the working class.

>and he's pro medical-for-all (he pays for his employees medical insurance. The cost of insurance isn't taken from his employees' paycheck).

Oh god please, don't stretch definition of Medicare for all. Also what does it say if he is so rich that he can offer that to his own ""tribe"" but he supports a political party whom is against that for all of us. So his tribe can be safe from illnesses and the rest of us can kick rocks. Got it.

>In addition to everything he is doing during this Coronavirus crisis, Adelson has donated over $25 million to The Adelson Educational Campus in Las Vegas to build a high school and contributed $25 million to the Yad Vashem Holocaust Martyrs' and Heroes' Remembrance Authority. Adelson also has funded the private, Boston-based Dr. Miriam and Sheldon G. Adelson Medical Research Foundation. This foundation initiated the Adelson Program in Neural Repair and Rehabilitation (APNRR) with $7.5 million donated to collaborating researchers at 10 universities.

See my above comment about billionaire philanthropy. For instance Bill Gates eradicated Malaria! ... but what they don't tell you is all the drilling operations for PC components and malaria was cutting into his costs.

Also those millions can be used as influence, now whoever is recipients of his cash influx are now more likely to support him and not talk negative about him. Its influence. Also he spent about .05% of his net wealth here.

>And again, his political affiliation should not diminish everything him,

Hard disagree, what you support is important. AOC is in hot water right now because she isn't supporting progressive challengers to encumbant democrats like herself.

If you do not stand up to fight for what you really believe then you do not believe it. Sorry.

If you support a political party financially and the political party does everything for you economically but is against who you are socially, you do not deserve ANY praise what so ever. Stop donating to the Republican party then do what you are doing is mostly fine. But if your cashing in from economic policies that outweighs what you are giving back then that money would of been better spent given to actual sectors of our economy that handles things like add to poor people. Not some made up Sheldon Adelson Feels Good Incorporated and Outreach Program.

>Sands, have done for their employees and for the community. The type of corporate responsibility they have shown is rare and is something all companies should aspire to.

Which allows a key takeaway here. Why is it up to billionaires, CEOs and their board to actually do something every company should be doing? We allowed the same billionaires to destroy the government by buying influence and now investing into a disfunctional governement via taxes is unappealing and in the wake of that, they use their massive amount of money to buy back goodwill when in the first place money should of never had a place within politics.

>In many ways, they operate in a very ""liberal"" fashion - with his company paying all his workers a living wage (highest paid employees on the strip)

The living wage in las vegas i believe is $17 a hour. Is everyone making that? I seriously doubt that.

>and having a large number of women and minorities in leadership positions (their two VPs for hotel ops are women).

Virtue signaling. Representation is important, but this matters to the MSM liberals or SJWs than it does to normal lefties.

>His company is actually the type of company all liberals advocate for and can use as an example of how everything liberals advocate is possible.

You are constantly saying anything left is liberal which exposes where and how you got your information and your line of reasoning. Yes liberals can get everything they wanted. Its because our liberals are CENTER RIGHT. Our liberals are basically economic republicans and socially liberals.

A potential vaccine against the novel coronavirus causing the covid-19 outbreak has been created in a University of Pittsburgh lab.

Researchers say the first phase of human clinical trials — which would include healthy volunteers in the Pittsburgh area — could start in the coming months.

 “This vaccine is designed to be safe, in part because it delivers very low doses of antigen,” Falo said. “Much lower doses than the traditional flu vaccine. Secondly, it delivers that antigen to a very confined space within the skin, so that it’s very unlikely that we would see any type of systemic responses that have been seen with some patients in the flu vaccine.” 

The process for making the vaccine does not require significantly complex or expensive equipment, which makes it very scalable, Falo said.

“At present time in our lab, one person with the set of molds and the centrifuge can make hundreds of microneedle arrays in a single day,” he said.

The vaccine does not need to be kept frozen or refrigerated, which could reduce shipping costs and help with distributing the vaccine.

“When the vaccine is actually ready for widespread deployment, it would most likely be ready broadly so that we would not have to ration the vaccine,” Falo said. “I would expect that the manufacturing and scale up would occur during the testing process, so that plenty of vaccine would be available if it proved to be effective.”

On Saturday, Naomi Davis, a New York City lifestyle blogger known online as Taza, shared that she and her family were also leaving the city and “heading west” in an RV. “My heart is breaking for what is happening in New York where I live and around the world right now,” she wrote in the post. “And after two full weeks in the apartment, we made the family decision to drive out west so we can have a little more space (namely some outdoor space for the kids) for a little while.


All three women stressed that, upon reaching their destinations, they would take precautions to avoid the spread of disease. Ms. Charnas said in a statement through her publicist that she is following “doctor’s recommendations to a tee” and taking “every precaution to ensure we did not and will not come into contact, six feet apart or otherwise, with any other individual for the foreseeable future.”

Ms. Maffucci said her family would quarantine for two weeks upon their arrival in Florida. She also packed food for the road to eliminate unnecessary stops. Ms. Davis posted that she decided to rent an RV in order to avoid hotels and also packed meals so as to limit outside human interaction.

Followers and medical experts, however, were not satisfied with these measures.

“I think it’s really dangerous and personally idiotic,” said Dr. Darien Sutton, an emergency room physician who has been using social media to educate the public about the coronavirus. “When I see these influencers travel around, I think they’re setting a really poor example of how to appropriately act during a pandemic. You have to hold yourself accountable for the possibility of transmitting this virus to people who are more vulnerable, and there’s no way to be 100 percent sure you don’t have the virus.”"

Volunteer in hospitals and fail to plan for a return? 


Let's face the facts. If by June the prospect of finishing this season isn't possible, then the next season isn't starting any time soon is it. Genuinely what is the logic of essentially saying the last 8 months didn't happen and pissing off dozen of clubs? What about all the managers who lost their jobs. What about all the players vying for individual accolades. What about all the fans who have spent thousands watching their team just to see it voided. What about all the lost TV revenue that some clubs have already spent. What about the teams like Leeds who spent money hoping for promotion? What about the European places? What about the likes of Norwich who have been shit and deserve to go down, they just get a reprieve and the hundreds of millions that come with it? 


The idea that you scrap a 75% completed season just to try and make sure the next one runs closer schedule is bonkers. And anyone suggesting it as a blinkered fool with an agenda. And it's usually because they want to laugh at Liverpool fans. 

You have got to prioritise the football that has actually been played. It's infinitely easier to squeeze in 8 games over a month than it is to void, face all the legal and moral outcomes of that, and start a new season.


In this weird hypothetical situation where the season is voided and a new one starts in October. What happens when a 2nd wave of Coronavirus hits over the winter? Because it isn't going away until there's a vaccine. We then have two stupidly voided seasons instead of one complete one and one voided one/unstarted one."

Interestingly their inventory grew.  They produced about 14k more cars than they delivered. I am wondering if they had been hoping for a big end of quarter push.  That may have been the cause of why they were so unwilling to shut down the plant (and the stock price).

March's numbers are probably going to be a bit worse than normal due to the end of quarter push. Keep in mind that the US, which is still the largest market, wasn't hit by the coronavirus until later in March, so that's partly why the hit wasn't too bad. 

Having a lot of inventory at the end of the period though might not be a good thing. In that regard, not just for safety, but for operations, it may have been a bad idea to produce because now the company has a lot of inventory  and sales in at least April will be bad with the coronavirus (at least outside of China).

>Modly said he had no doubt that Crozier “did what he thought was in the best interest of the safety and the well-being of his crew,” but that his decision complicated the situation for the Navy and could have emboldened adversaries to strike in the region.

But...we don't keep lions as pets. Unless you're Joe Exotic, and well, he's in prison.

He's Jewish and he supports whoever that supports Israel. However, his political affiliation should not take away from the generosity he's shown towards those who works for him and the community. What he's doing, through his company, for his employees and the Las Vegas community as a whole during this Coronavirus crisis is absolutely amazing and commendable. The good he has done for the city, via his company, is amazing. Just like how someone's not automatically a lazy freeloader because they're Democrats, someone's not automatically evil because they're Republican.


And just to highlight some of the things he's liberal on, he's pro environment (The Venetian hired people to literally sort through all the trash and recycle what can be recycled), pro choice, pro stem cell research, pro immigration (he supports the Dreamers), and he's pro medical-for-all (he pays for his employees medical insurance. The cost of insurance isn't taken from his employees' paycheck).

In addition to everything he is doing during this Coronavirus crisis, Adelson has donated over $25 million to The Adelson Educational Campus in Las Vegas to build a high school and contributed $25 million to the Yad Vashem Holocaust Martyrs' and Heroes' Remembrance Authority. Adelson also has funded the private, Boston-based Dr. Miriam and Sheldon G. Adelson Medical Research Foundation. This foundation initiated the Adelson Program in Neural Repair and Rehabilitation (APNRR) with $7.5 million donated to collaborating researchers at 10 universities.

And again, his political affiliation should not diminish everything him, and Sands, have done for their employees and for the community. The type of corporate responsibility they have shown is rare and is something all companies should aspire to. In many ways, they operate in a very ""liberal"" fashion - with his company paying all his workers a living wage (highest paid employees on the strip) and having a large number of women and minorities in leadership positions (their two VPs for hotel ops are women). His company is actually the type of company all liberals advocate for and can use as an example of how everything liberals advocate is possible."

Next, “I don’t take responsibility at all”. Again, no context. He wasn’t talking about the virus in general. He was talking about certain people not being able to get testing.

“Reopening by easter” was a possibility he said. He only takes advice from experts and would not act without such, is what he said after.

I believe all of NJ, NY, and WA have their social distancing deadline extended 'indefinitely', indicating there's no specific date to resume operations. States that are affected much less like those mentioned above have a good idea when the number of cases can become manageable and therefore have concrete dates to resume normal operations. 

But if you're in NJ/PA/NY/WA you might have a really late exam cancellation because they're certainly going to extend social distancing rules past April 17th.

Here is the article.

Law firms won’t be recruiting summer associates in late July and early August this year.
All but a one of the so-called T-14 law schools by Thursday had announced postponements to their on-campus interview programs due to the coronavirus pandemic, and a growing number in the top 50 of the U.S. News & World Report rankings have followed suit.

Columbia Law School, which sends a higher number of graduates into associate jobs at large firms than any other school, became the first to postpone OCI on March 23. But the movement picked up steam this week when Harvard Law School, New York University School of Law and the University of Pennsylvania Carey Law School joined the list of campuses delaying summer associate recruiting. Northwestern University Pritzker School of Law is the one T-14 school that hasn’t yet announced a delay.
“Nobody is recruiting over the summer,” said Harvard career services Dean Mark Weber. “It’s off the table. I think January will become the new August.”

The delays are the result of numerous factors, but law firms initiated the push to hold off on recruiting programs that bring partners to campus for hundreds of screening interviews with incoming 2Ls.

First, it’s not clear that those in-person interviews will even be possible in the late summer if social distancing rules remain in effect.

Second, firms are already dealing with significant economic fallout of the pandemic and uncertainty of their futures and staff needs. The past two weeks have brought news of law firms laying off staff and associates, withholding partner pay and furloughing associates. That means hiring summer associates who will go on to become the firm’s new associate class in 2022 would come at a time when firms know little about what their staffing needs will be two years ahead of time. If firms moved ahead with hiring over the summer, they’d likely hire half as many summer associates, Weber noted.

Third, many law firms have delayed the start of their upcoming summer associate programs, pushing them later into the summer. They do not have the desire or the capabilities to simultaneously run those programs—many of which will now be completed remotely—while also juggling summer associate recruiting.

And finally, most Big Law feeder schools have adopted pass/fail grading for the spring semester. Law firms want to see at least two semesters of grades when making summer associate hiring decisions. Delaying the hiring process should give them more than one semester of grades to evaluate.

“I firmly believe that the January schedule is the best solution to this current problem,” said Gavin White, the global hiring partner at Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom. “I’d go further and say that I hope we can continue with the January schedule in future years.”

White said he has not heard any law school say that it intends to hold summer associates interview programs in July or August, though not all have committed to a January timetable.

Yale Law School, Stanford Law School, the University of Chicago Law School, the University of Michigan Law School and Duke Law School are among the schools that have told students that OCI is postponed until late fall or early 2021, but have not committed to a more specific timetable. Other schools, including Columbia, Harvard, NYU, the University of Virginia School of Law and the University of California, Berkeley School of Law have said OCI will now be in January.

Still others, including Georgetown University Law Center and the University of California at Los Angeles School of Law, have said January or February are both under consideration.

“I know that our law school and legal employer members are actively working through the impact of the current situation on summer programs and recruiting plans,” said James Leipold, executive director of the National Association for Law Placement. “During the current state of civil emergency, the NALP board of directors does not believe that there can be uniform solutions that will serve all institutions, but they do believe firmly that there are a multiplicity of solutions that will preserve the fundamental values of fairness, access, and transparency to which NALP is committed.”

Weber said that most students at Harvard welcomed Tuesday’s news that the summer associate recruiting program will be delayed until January.

“Most students really appreciated the move,” he said. “It’s one less thing for them to worry about.”

In its email to students last week announcing the delay of summer associate interview, Chicago’s career services office noted some advantages to the new winter recruiting schedule.

“This has many benefits for you, including giving you more time to research employers, to explore practice areas through research and classes, and to work with us on your job search strategies,” the email reads.

Postponing OCI essentially gives both students and law firms some time and breathing room to make plans amid the rapidly changing situation, and the delay gives the pandemic time to subside before hiring takes place, Weber noted. Even under that rosy scenario, career services offices are bracing for hiring slowdowns.

“We know next year won’t have the same kind of robust hiring that we’ve seen for the past two years,” Weber said. “That’s not hard to figure out.”

But Berkeley Law Dean Erwin Chemerinsky wrote in an email to students Monday that delaying OCI until January gives them the best possible chance at securing a summer associate position under the difficult circumstances brought on by the coronavirus outbreak.

“Employers will have a much better sense of their hiring needs in January than in August and there is reason to hope that they will be able to do more hiring at the later time,” he wrote. “Most of all, it is clear that employers would prefer this shift.”"

>Person-to-person spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is thought to occur mainly via respiratory droplets, resembling the spread of influenza. With droplet transmission, virus released in the respiratory secretions when a person with infection coughs, sneezes, or talks can infect another person if it makes direct contact with the mucous membranes; infection can also occur if a person touches an infected surface and then touches his or her eyes, nose, or mouth. Droplets typically do not travel more than six feet (about two meters) and do not linger in the air.

Given the current uncertainty regarding transmission mechanisms, airborne precautions are recommended in certain situations.

&#x200B;

*Death of a 75-year-old woman in MG on January 23 is now considered the starting point for the circulation of the Sars-Cov-2 coronavirus in Brazil.*

&#x200B;

The Ministry of Health said on Thursday (2) that the first death caused by coronavirus recorded in Brazil occurred on January 23. \[The victim was\] a 75-year-old woman who lived in Minas Gerais.

&#x200B;

According to the \[Ministry of Health\], the investigation shows that the Sars-Cov-2 coronavirus was already spreading in the country before the first case's announcement. Until then, the first positive case of coronavirus in Brazil had been announced on February 26. \[The positive case was\] a man who lives in São Paulo, is 61 years old, and came from Italy. When the case was confirmed at the time, there were another 20 cases under investigation and 59 suspected cases were already ruled out.

&#x200B;

""\[We must\] remember that we are investigating hospitalized cases. Many of these cases have collected material, and we had from a retrospective investigation the identification of the first confirmed case, it is from the fourth epidemiological week, on 23 January,"" said the Secretary of Health Surveillance, Wanderson Oliveira."

Part of the reason was to preserve medical-grade masks, including N95 respirator masks, for health care workers who desperately need them at a time when they are in continuously short supply.

According to a federal official, the C.D.C. has been preparing to recommend that everyone wear face coverings in public settings, like pharmacies and grocery stores, to avoid unwittingly spreading the virus. Public health officials have continued to stress, however, that N95 masks and surgical masks should be saved for front-line doctors and nurses, who have been in dire need of protective gear.”"

Those videos can be extremely difficult to watch. I’d definitely recommend taking a break from those videos for a little while and focus on something more positive - the changes you can make to help animals! 

I’m not sure where you live or what your job situation is like, but I know many people are in a situation where they are stuck at home due to coronavirus. If this is you too, it’s a perfect time to learn new recipes to adjust to a vegetarian (or vegan!) lifestyle. 

I’d highly recommend investigating recipes from other countries. Many countries have tons of beautiful dishes that are traditionally meat (and even animal-product free).  Looking into dishes from other cultures and experimenting with new recipes really helped me originally transition to vegetarianism. It kept me from framing things in terms of deprivation and replacement such as “well I can’t eat meat now, what do I replace it with?” But rather, it was so so fun to learn new spice mixtures and work with new ingredients and try totally new flavors and dishes.   Actually right now I’m doing this, but with vegan recipes!

2020-04-02,chicdevice,Coronavirus,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/ftosao/fired_amazon_striker_demands_bezos_protect/fm94mm2/,"Chris Smalls, an Amazon worker who was fired from his job at the retail giant’s Staten Island warehouse after organizing a walkout, demanded on Thursday that CEO Jeff Bezos better protect workers and noted the company is reliant on them amid the coronavirus pandemic in an open letter.

In the letter, published in The Guardian, Smalls said he first began noticing symptoms such as fatigue, light-headedness and vomiting among workers at the facility in early March, before the first case was confirmed at the facility. Smalls wrote that he brought his concerns to human resources, who insisted they were following Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines.

Within the facility, Smalls said, workers have been given rubber gloves rather than latex, no masks and limited cleaning supplies. He wrote that, feeling unsafe, he exhausted his paid time off to avoid getting sick.

Smalls adds that the company has imposed mandatory overtime to keep up with demand, meaning numerous employees are at work “sick as dogs” to earn overtime pay, which he refers to as “blood money.”

The company has said Smalls was fired not for organizing the walkout but for coming to work despite being told to quarantine himself after coming into contact with a worker who tested positive. Smalls wrote that the company did not put any other workers on quarantine and that he believes he was targeted for retaliation.

He adds that he has gotten calls from numerous other workers seeking to stage walkouts of their own, writing, “We are starting a revolution and people around the country support us.”

“If you’re an Amazon customer, here’s how you can practice real social distancing: stop clicking the 'Buy now' button. Go to the grocery store instead. You might be saving some lives,” he writes. “And to Mr. Bezos my message is simple. I don’t give a damn about your power. You think you’re powerful? We’re the ones that have the power. Without us working, what are you going to do? You’ll have no money. We have the power. We make money for you. Never forget that.”

New York state and city officials have called for action on Smalls's firing, with state Attorney General Letitia James (D) calling for an investigation and Mayor Bill de Blasio (D) saying that if Smalls was fired for staging the walkout it would violate city laws.

By [Jay Greene](https://www.washingtonpost.com/people/jay-greene/) April 2, 2020 at 3:47 p.m. PDT

SEATTLE — Amazon’s top legal executive suggested the company’s senior leaders fend of workplace safety criticism by trying to turn the focus on an activist warehouse worker [it had fired](https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2020/03/30/worker-strike-instacart-amazon-whole-foods/?tid=lk_inline_manual_2&itid=lk_inline_manual_2) just days earlier, according to leaked notes from a meeting with top executives.

The company fired Chris Smalls, a New York warehouse worker, on Monday after he complained to several media outlets, including The Washington Post, that Amazon had not done enough to protect its workforce during the [coronavirus](https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2020/02/28/what-you-need-know-about-coronavirus/?tid=lk_inline_manual_3&itid=lk_inline_manual_3) pandemic. In an email recounting a meeting with senior executives, including chief executive Jeff Bezos, executives discussed a strategy to shift the focus to Smalls. (Bezos owns The Post.)

“He’s not smart, or articulate, and to the extent the press wants to focus on us versus him, we will be in a much stronger PR position than simply explaining for the umpteenth time how we’re trying to protect workers,” Amazon General Counsel David Zapolsky wrote in an email first obtained by the [news site Vice](https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/5dm8bx/leaked-amazon-memo-details-plan-to-smear-fired-warehouse-organizer-hes-not-smart-or-articulate). The Washington Post confirmed the authenticity of the email.

When Amazon fired Smalls, it said it did so after he ignored a request from his manager to stay home because of his contact with a worker who tested positive for covid-19. Smalls called the firing “retaliation” for speaking out against the company.

In a statement, Zapolsky called his comments in the leaked email “personal and emotional.”

“I was frustrated and upset that an Amazon employee would endanger the health and safety of other Amazonians by repeatedly returning to the premises after having been warned to quarantine himself after exposure to virus Covid-19,” Zapolsky said. “I let my emotions draft my words and get the better of me.”

At least two executives on Amazon’s most senior leadership team in the daily meeting executed on Zapolsky’s strategy Tuesday and Wednesday. Amazon senior vice president of operations Dave Clark and senior vice president of global corporate affairs Jay Carney both mocked [a tweet from Sen. Bernie Sanders](https://twitter.com/BernieSanders/status/1245113355582550021) (I-Vt.), who called Smalls’s firing “disgraceful.” Both [Clark ](https://twitter.com/davehclark/status/1245156275869999104)and [Carney ](https://twitter.com/JayCarney/status/1245474780746330119)put the focus on Smalls, saying he “purposely violated social distancing rules.”

Sanders, a frequent critic of Amazon’s treatment of its workers, wasn’t alone among politicians criticizing Amazon’s firing of Smalls. A few hours after Amazon terminated Smalls, New York Attorney General Letitia James (D) called the move “disgraceful,” asked the National Labor Relations Board to investigate the incident, said she is “considering all legal options.”

Amazon continues to [wrestle with the havoc](https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2020/03/17/amazons-warehouse-workers-sound-alarms-about-coronavirus-spread?tid=lk_inline_manual_18&itid=lk_inline_manual_18) the coronavirus has wreaked on its operations. Employees in at least 28 Amazon warehouse and shipping facilities across the United States have [tested positive for covid-19](https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2020/03/24/amazon-warehouse-workers-coronavirus-positive/?tid=lk_inline_manual_18&itid=lk_inline_manual_18), according to Amazon, its warehouse workers and local media reports.

Even so, Amazon said it has already hired for 80,000 of the 100,000 new jobs it announced a little more than two weeks ago. The company is racing to hire employees, who will work in Amazon’s warehouses and deliver its packages, to unclog [the crush of orders](https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2020/03/24/amazon-prime-deliveries-coronavirus/?tid=lk_inline_manual_19&itid=lk_inline_manual_19) the company has received from customers leery of leaving their homes to shop."

1. The biggest danger; by far, is an overwhelmed medical system. If the entire population is sick over the course of 5 years we are fine. If everyone is sick within the span of 5 weeks, lots and lots of people will die.

2. In a year or two there will likely be vaccines at least for high risk groups.

2020-04-02,newstart3385,collapse,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/collapse/comments/ftoenu/is_corona_just_the_beginning/fm92pw5/,"Some sources say that SARS-CoV2 does not mutate quickly. This is not true.   


Only about a thousand genomes have been sequenced worldwide, so we are missing a lot of them.   


The virus mutates 1,000 times faster than influenza viruses and 36,000 times faster than measles . This is EXTREMELY worrisome.  


The genome of the coronavirus is extraordinarily long for a virus. It has more than a dozen genes encoded by more than 30,000 bases. By comparison, the cold and HIV viruses are only about 9,200 bases long.   


Most mutations will make the virus less dangerous. Some will put a stop signal in the middle of a protein and make the virus inactive. Others will simply make the virus less effective because viral proteins must work together with human proteins in a complex collaboration. If they change, they probably won't work as well.   


The most dangerous type of mutation is called a ""false sense"" mutation because it changes the amino acids that make up viral proteins. A few changes in the amino acids of a protein can make a huge difference in how that protein behaves, such as small changes in computer software that can change the way that software works.   


Amino acid changes in one of the more than a dozen current genetic variants of coronavirus worldwide could lead to an even more infectious or deadly strain or make detection kits less accurate. The genetic modifications that caused the 1957 influenza pandemic changed only 5 amino acids in the surface protein of this virus.   


Yet, by March 15, the most mutated viral sample already had 10 mutations (!), including the gene we don't want to see mutated at all.   


Two weeks later, there was one with 16 mutations, 14 of which were errors, fortunately not all of them in the gene in question.   


But if these strains continue to mutate over the next 18 months, they could make vaccines less effective or trigger a worst-case scenario in which our immune system is unable to prevent reinfection.  


Fortunately, most virology experts say that such developments are highly unlikely, but could still happen ... We have never had a true global pandemic caused by a coronavirus in billions of people, which changes and evolves, so it is very complicated, if not impossible, to predict the further evolution of the virus."

February 26: “The 15 (cases in the US) within a couple of days is going to be down to close to zero.”

March 4: “If we have thousands or hundreds of thousands of people that get better just by, you know, sitting around and even going to work — some of them go to work, but they get better.”

March 5: “I NEVER said people that are feeling sick should go to work.”

March 5: “The United States… has, as of now, only 129 cases… and 11 deaths. We are working very hard to keep these numbers as low as possible!”

March 6: “I think we’re doing a really good job in this country at keeping it down… a tremendous job at keeping it down.”

March 6: “Anybody right now, and yesterday, anybody that needs a test gets a test. They’re there. And the tests are beautiful…. the tests are all perfect like the letter was perfect. The transcription was perfect. Right? This was not as perfect as that but pretty good.”

March 6: “I like this stuff. I really get it. People are surprised that I understand it… Every one of these doctors said, ‘How do you know so much about this?’ Maybe I have a natural ability. Maybe I should have done that instead of running for president.”

March 6: “I don't need to have the numbers double because of one ship that wasn't our fault.”

March 10: ""It will go away. Just stay calm. It will go away.""

March 13: National Emergency Declaration

March 13: “I don't take responsibility at all”

March 15: ""TODAY IS A NATIONAL DAY OF PRAYER. GOD BLESS EVERYONE!""

March 17: ""It snuck up on us.""  source

March 22: “It is absolutely critical that Americans continue to follow the federal government’s guidelines. So important about social distancing, non-essential travel, and hand-washing.”

March 23: Democratic concerns have focused on a $500 billion funding program Republicans want to create for loans and loan guarantees, with some Democrats calling it a “slush fund” that lacks any oversight because the Treasury Department would have broad discretion over who receives the money. Asked about this Monday evening, Trump responded, “I’ll be the oversight.” The vote Monday was 49 to 46, well short of the 60-vote threshold needed to advance the legislation for a final debate.

2020-04-02,Culverts_Flood_Away,trashy,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/trashy/comments/ftric4/real_class_act_at_costco/fm9iris/,"There are tons of problems with calling it the ""China Virus."" Here, I'll list some of them for you:

1. There are multiple viruses that have originated from China, and more will be yet to come, no doubt. So calling this one ""the China Virus"" is like saying it's the only one. That's stupid. It's unclear which virus that has originated from China you're even talking about. China is huge, after all.
2. Even if you only intend to call it that just to call out the nation of origin, it does nothing productive, and instead breeds resentment for Chinese people. Case in point: Chinese people all over the world are being attacked and victimized by horrible people taking their fear and anger at the crisis out on them, whether out of irrational anger, racism, or both. Calling it a Chinese virus or the Wuhan Virus does nothing to scientifically classify it, and everything to alienate Chinese people from the rest of the world.
2. Calling it the Chinese Virus makes you sound like an idiot, as though you don't even know the virus's actual name. The name is everywhere now: COVID-19. Hell, you could get away with just calling it Coronavirus if you wanted to, since it's the only human coronavirus that's prevalent at the moment. Instead, by going for the region-specific name, you're just outing yourself as a racist, xenophobic prick, thus reducing the capacity of anyone listening to you to take you seriously.

And in case it's not clear, German Measles, Japanese Encephalitis, and West Nile Virus are also terrible names to use for viruses, for the same reasons listed above. You were so close, man. So close. You're just another one of the self-aware wolves I was talking about, unfortunately.

Edit:

I forgot to add this point. It's true that I used the word ""whataboutism"" incorrectly, as it's usually a term used to describe when you point out the mistakes of *others* in order to minimize the impact of your own.

And President Trump's response, or lack of, is a a disgrace. Like China, he tried to censor it too - he forced the CDC to get his administration's approval before they can issue any statements in an attempt to hide how serious this is. And here's videos of him and Fox News calling it a hoax and claiming ""mainstream media"" is hyping up the virus to attack Trump - downplaying it instead of preparing our nation for something that we knew, for months, was coming:

https://youtu.be/ifKbwDf51bA

https://youtu.be/ch7_t2Ri2Zg

Because of his mishandling of the crisis, America is now the new epicenter of the virus.  Even now, there's no leadership from Trump. Every state is pretty much left to fend for themselves. And in order to get federal aid, states has to feed his ego or else he'll leave Americans in that state to die. He's literally refusing to take calls from Governors who refuses to worship him and directing the Coronavirus Response Team to do the same. Instead of getting the the ventilators states desperately need, he's feuding with the begging Governors telling them they don't need it and to show appreciation to him for the ""great job"" he's doing. And every day he shares misinformation on TV and on Twitter - misinformation doctors from his own administration has to issue corrections for afterwards. His careless comments have led to critical shortages of malaria medicine and even needless death.

Meanwhile, every other country in the world have a coordinated, nationwide response to the virus. South Korea got the virus at the same time as us and they've already got it under control and life is slowly returning to normal there. Meanwhile for the United States, because of Trump's gross mishandling of the virus, the worse is yet to come.

And instead of focusing on dealing with the crisis, he's also busy on Twitter deflecting blame/distracting by issuing divisive and xenophobic statements that put Asian Americans at risk.  So as an Asian American, in addition to dealing with the virus and the loss of income I'm suffering from because of the virus, I also have to deal with the ignorant people that's been emboldened by him.

Great job you're doing there, President Trump (sarcasm)."

First of all, you're incredibly unlikely to contract COVID19 from the trash can or the mail. That you have a different risk tolerance doesn't mean you should pick a fight.

There may be other factors with respect to the children. If those two families are isolating, and they share mutual contact via their children, then again, the risk is relatively low if the kids aren't wrestling and shoving fingers in each others faces. Whatsmore, there are often tradeoffs that have to be made. Perhaps the parents need the time off, maybe they have their own restrictions, whether physical or mental, maybe the children need to burn the energy. Its much like someone deciding to take antidepressants while pregnant. Sure, there is an elevated risk by making that decision, but the flip side of the coin in certain circumstances may be much worse.

You certainly sound like you're trying to be the coronavirus police and you're going to have to live next to these people long after the disease spreads.

Worry about yourself. Don't worry yourself about things beyond your control. If you had a relationship, you could talk to them, but it doesn't sound like you do."

He said the measures include transporting ventilators from hospitals that don't need them at the moment to others that do, using anesthesia machines as ventilators, splitting one ventilator between two patients and converting BiPAP machines into ventilators. 

""I don't want to say yet I'm confident, and it depends on how many we need, but I can say with confidence we have researched every possibility, every idea, every measure you can possibly take to find ventilators - this state has done. That I can promise you.""

He said the state released 400 ventilators Wednesday night to the New York City Health and Hospitals Corporation and another 200 to Long and Island and Westchester.

As of Thursday, 2,373 people had died in New York state due to complications from COVID-19, up from 1,941 a day earlier, Cuomo announced.

I'm finishing up my senior year right now at home (stupid coronavirus). I'm from western North Carolina but I didn't know that NC State existed until junior year of high school. So I'm in/was in the sorta same boat as you're in right now.

I saw from your profile that you got accepted in NC State and UNC Charlotte. Good choices, I got accepted into both as well. I toured both in my senior year (and if my memory serves me correctly) and found that in my experience, the dorms at Charlotte were a little farther away from classes than my liking.

At NC State, I was lucky enough to grab a housing spot at University Towers through a lease with NC State. With the new housing rule of freshmen staying on campus, upperclassmen are being pushed off and thus the lease with University Towers. I don't know where you'd end up being placed in housing, but here's to getting a spot. I bring up University Towers as it is across the street from Nelson Hall, where most, if not all, of your classes as an accounting major will be taking place, which is an added bonus if you're running late. (I can make it from the 5th floor (elevator down) of UT to the 2nd floor (stairs up) of Nelson Hall in 4 minutes. Otherwise, the main campus housing is a little farther away but definitely still walkable or bus-rideable. Because you're a transfer student, you're going to get last chance at housing, sorry about that.

I can't really give you anything on night life, as I don't drink. So no bars or frat parties for me.

Most of my friends are either people I met at orientation (I was placed into a group of Poole College of Management students, mostly accounting majors), people I later met in classes at NC State, or people from clubs and organizations. I will gladly promote Technician, one of two of our campus' newspapers. I have worked there since I came to NC State as a copy editor (you fact-check any articles and make sure the grammar, etc. is correct).

The sports are pretty okay here, my personal favorite to watch is men's soccer. Our women's basketball team is freaking amazing, this season we won the ACC championship for the first time since 1991. Our men's basketball team is so-so and our football team could be better, but hey, you can't win them all. Pretty much everything else, our teams are all really good. Oh and wrestling is awesome as well, we were 15-0 in our regular season and won the ACC Championship as well.

Student life is pretty good (I'm one of the those people who would stay in my room binging tv shows with my roommate). There are plenty of student organizations on campus. I think either the week right before classes or the first week of classes there is a club fair (I think it's called Campus Connections) where a majority of clubs, orgs, and Greek Life will be there. Oh and download the NC State Guides app from the app store, it will help during the Welcome Week to schedule what stuff you want to go to.

If you need anything else, you can DM me anytime, even after you get to school. Have fun at whether place you go to."

'The theory is that once applied to the back of the throat, ARMS-I may work to prevent new airborne viral particles from attaching to the back of the oral cavity.'


CLEVELAND — University Hospitals in Cleveland will lead a clinical trial that involves giving an investigational drug to its caregivers who are working the frontlines of the coronavirus pandemic.

The drug, known as ARMS-I, will be tested to see if it can prevent airborne transmission of the coronavirus. It’s also being used to determine if it reduces the symptoms for healthcare providers who have tested positive for COVID-19.

“In laboratory studies, ARMS-I has been shown to kill enveloped viruses, including influenza,"" UH officials said in a press release. “COVID-19 is also an enveloped virus. The preclinical data are encouraging, but studies in humans are necessary to determine whether the product is effective against specific pathogens. The UH study is intended to address that need with regard to COVID-19. Additionally, an important study recently published in the Journal of Virology indicates that one of the active ingredients in ARMS-I has potent antiviral activity against coronavirus MERS-CoV.”

The trial is expected to begin within two weeks.

“We are optimistic about the potential benefits ARMS-I may provide in the fight against COVID-19 and in protecting our health care workers,” said Afif Ghannoum, Chief Executive Officer of ARMS Pharmaceutical. “The theory is that once applied to the back of the throat, ARMS-I may work to prevent new airborne viral particles from attaching to the back of the oral cavity called the oropharynx and therefore stop transmission. If the trial is successful, as we hope, we will work closely with the FDA and other relevant authorities with the goal of swiftly securing the necessary approvals to manufacture the product in quantities necessary to broadly help protect health care workers on the frontline.”

A previous study suggested this drug might be effective as a throat spray in reducing infection, according to Dr. Robert Salata, MD, Chairman of the Department of Medicine at UH Cleveland Medical Center.

“The goal of this trial is to rapidly determine whether ARMS-I is effective in providing protection against COVID-19 for frontline health workers,” Dr. Salata said. “We will be measuring whether there is a decrease in the rate of COVID-19 infection, and also whether there is a decrease in the frequency, duration and severity of acute upper respiratory infection in caregivers who may contract the virus.”

UH trial participants will include clinical staff who are directly caring for patients.

“This trial is a randomized placebo-controlled crossover study and during the course of the trial, everyone will get the investigational drug even if they started with the placebo,” UH officials explained."

But in the interest of disseminating *actual* information, I'll play along.
  
We're having to rely on private laboratories because funding has been cut across multiple sources.  The PREDICT program which was used to develop an early response to the malaria outbreak in Africa, gone.  The last address by the director stated that a flu outbreak is likely to cripple the country.  [Bill Gates gave a TED talk YEARS ago](https://www.ted.com/talks/bill_gates_the_next_outbreak_we_re_not_ready?language=en).  The CDC's budget?  Slashed by 15% last year and [proposed cuts THIS year, even with the pandemic](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/msar_fy21.pdf).

In the emergency preparedness, about $1 of preparation saves about $4 in recovery efforts.  Same in terms of health care.  Same goes for public health.  Less than 1/10 of 1% of the GDP went to preventative medicine and public health.  We can spend trillions on health care, why not spend money maintaining health, not being reactive and treating disease?


I'm well aware of Abbott's test.  However, getting it into the hands of those that need it is going to be the issue.  I fully support an all hands on deck approach.  Go to the source.  [Here are a list of FDA's EUA (Emergency Use Authorizations)](https://www.fda.gov/medical-devices/emergency-situations-medical-devices/emergency-use-authorizations#covid19ivd) for various tests.

The issue of the red tape as you put it, is coming from [your fearless leader](https://imgur.com/DQF9bhM). What's his first response?  Let's put the [person that screwed up his state's HIV outbreak in charge](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2020/02/27/mike-pence-hiv-indiana/).

On top of that, most of the red tape is 
He knew all along that it could be bad, but states multiple times blatant misinformation.  Fauci is busy correcting him.  Since you don't like media, how about a CDC report on how 45 screwed up the [whole cruise ship fiasco because he, ""likes the numbers where they were""](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/69/wr/mm6912e3.htm?s_cid=mm6912e3_w).  Or how about [the NSC's playbook](https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/25/trump-coronavirus-national-security-council-149285) that is meant for this sort of thing?   It's less than 70 pages.  I'm sure he could have someone read it, no? 

Hate to go off the deep end here, but a lot of this mess could have been prevented.  If PREDICT was still around, they could have had ""boots on the ground"" in China to see what was and wasn't working.  We could have ramped the preparedness in the U.S. AT THE SAME TIME.  Pandemics were rare prior to the luxury of air travel.  Now it's much easier to spread.  Number one thing to do is mitigate and get ahead of it.

Some things to keep in mind:

* All blood is tested. After 1985 when several people become ill with HIV after receiving donor blood, testing became a priority. In 2003, nearly 2 decades ago, your chances of becoming infected are between [1 in 1.4 million and 1 in 1.8 million units per unit transfused](http://hivinsite.ucsf.edu/InSite?page=kb-07-02-09#S2.2X). No transfusion-associated HIV-2 cases have been reported in the United States.
* HIV tests take 4-6 weeks to complete. A more rapid modern test exists that can identify with high accuracy positivity within 11 days.
* MtF Transgendered individuals are exempt from policies regarding men who have sex with men.
* The Red Cross, the World Health Organization, and the European Union have had an enormous in [changing these policies.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5554671/)
* Ireland is reviewing moving to a 3 months deferment window after a civil lawsuit was levied against them for inadequately assessing a male donors sexual history in regard to intercourse with another man.
* [Italy,](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3729137/) Latvia, Poland, Russia and Spain have no deferment period at all, but medical literature revolving around this issue has been published in their respective languages, so it's hard to interpret impact.
* Both [Canada](https://www.blood.ca/sites/default/files/CBS-AR2019-en.pdf) and the [UK](https://www.nhsbt.nhs.uk/news/scientific-review-offers-chance-for-more-people-to-give-blood/) have reduced deferment periods to 3 months in 2019 and 2017 respectively without additional risk thus far. [Additional PubMed article here.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6334046/)

[The](http://www.asahi.com/topics/word/%E6%96%B0%E5%9E%8B%E8%82%BA%E7%82%8E.html) Japanese Society of Intensive Care Medicine issued a statement on January 1 that the beds in the [intensive care unit](http://www.asahi.com/topics/word/%E9%9B%86%E4%B8%AD%E6%B2%BB%E7%99%82%E5%AE%A4.html) (ICU), which can handle severe cases of the [new coronavirus,](http://www.asahi.com/topics/word/%E6%96%B0%E5%9E%8B%E8%82%BA%E7%82%8E.html) may be less than 1,000 beds due to lack of staff. He notes that if the number of patients continues to increase, the collapse of the intensive care system will ""visit very quickly"" and that deaths will surge.

　Intensive care uses a [respirator](http://www.asahi.com/topics/word/%E4%BA%BA%E5%B7%A5%E5%91%BC%E5%90%B8%E5%99%A8.html) , [dialysis](http://www.asahi.com/topics/word/%E4%BA%BA%E5%B7%A5%E9%80%8F%E6%9E%90.html) machine, etc. , while closely checking the blood pressure and respiratory status of the severely ill, and recovering. In severe pneumonia, an artificial lung (ECMO) is used to allow the patient's blood to pass through an oxygen supply device and rest the lungs.

　However, Japan's intensive care system is more vulnerable than Europe and the United States. The ICU has about 5 beds per 100,000 population, and one nurse sees two patients. Many developed countries have one nurse per patient. Beds in [Germany](http://www.asahi.com/topics/word/%E3%83%89%E3%82%A4%E3%83%84.html) are six times as large as in Japan and twice as much in [Italy](http://www.asahi.com/topics/word/%E3%82%A4%E3%82%BF%E3%83%AA%E3%82%A2.html) , where [medical collapse](http://www.asahi.com/topics/word/%E5%8C%BB%E7%99%82%E5%B4%A9%E5%A3%8A.html) is occurring .

　The statement stated that two nurses would need to be able to handle severe cases of the [new corona](http://www.asahi.com/topics/word/%E6%96%B0%E5%9E%8B%E8%82%BA%E7%82%8E.html) , and that few doctors could use a [ventilator](http://www.asahi.com/topics/word/%E4%BA%BA%E5%B7%A5%E5%91%BC%E5%90%B8%E5%99%A8.html) for patients with severe pneumonia . Although the domestic ICU there about 6500 beds estimation, by subtracting the amount to be used, such as in a patient waiting for a recovery after another illness or surgery, at present [the new corona](http://www.asahi.com/topics/word/%E6%96%B0%E5%9E%8B%E8%82%BA%E7%82%8E.html) not less than ""1 thousand beds will be able corresponding to severe's There is a possibility.

They estimate that in an optimistic scenario, the inflection point where new daily cases would continue to reduce day-by-day would be around the end of April, the true point of inflection of the pandemic at around April 6, which would be 3 days from now.

Estimated damage to the German economy: -9% if everything is going quick and easy and -34% if everything goes to the wall.

They explicitly mention South Korea for their creative use of telephone booth swab stations and drive-in strategy and mentioned that around 100k-200k PCR tests a day for 10 days might be a reasonable assumption.

There’s some nonsense going around related to Muslims amongst the Hindu community in the U.K. (as always). Basically some hindus started a rumour and spread it to other hindus that Muslims were still going to mosque (even though all mosques have been closed down so that would be impossible) and they’ve been told to spit on hindus so they get coronavirus. 

It’s the most petty bs I’ve seen in a while and just a month or 2 ago they were knocking down mosques in parts of India and trying to kill Muslims. And I’m tired of all the fighting.

&#x200B;

#### Asymptomatic and Pre-Symptomatic Infection

Several studies have documented SARS-CoV-2 infection in patients who never develop symptoms (asymptomatic) and in patients not yet symptomatic (pre-symptomatic).13,15,17-25 Since asymptomatic persons are not routinely tested, the prevalence of asymptomatic infection and detection of pre-symptomatic infection is not well understood. One study found that as many as 13% of RT-PCR-confirmed cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection in children were asymptomatic.13 Another study of skilled nursing facility residents infected with SARS-CoV-2 from a healthcare worker demonstrated that half were asymptomatic or pre-symptomatic at the time of contact tracing evaluation and testing.25 Patients may have abnormalities on chest imaging before the onset of symptoms.19,20 Some data suggest that pre-symptomatic infection tended to be detected in younger individuals and was less likely to be associated with viral pneumonia.19,20

Although transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from asymptomatic or pre-symptomatic persons has been reported17,21,22, risk of transmission is thought to be greatest when patients are symptomatic. Viral RNA shedding, measured indirectly by RT-PCR cycle threshold values, is greatest at the time of symptom onset and declines over the course of several days to weeks.26,27 The exact degree of SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA shedding that confers risk of transmission is not yet clear.

> The rate of the coronavirus’ spread in Israel has slowed, according to a report prepared this week by a team of 30 experts appointed by the National Security Council to analyze the outbreak, with eyes now cautiously pointed towards devising an exit strategy.


> According to the findings in a document obtained by TheMarker, the daily number of those contracting COVID-19 in Israel dropped by 33 percent since a March 26 peak. The daily rate of infection went from 1.25 to 1.15 per patient, meaning the number of people infected doubles every five instead of every three days.

> The data could be skewed according to the number of tests conducted, but the team confirmed its interpretation using more reliable figures: The number of cases in serious condition, and the number of fatalities. “The number of [new] patients in serious condition and fatalities is [predicted to be] 100 per day,” down from 270, the report said.

> The government’s emergency measures were based on a forecast of over 1,100 new confirmed cases each day. This week, the actual daily number of confirmed new patients was between 500 and 700.
Patients.

> Even at a low rate of infection, 1.2 people per patient, the original model predicted 22,000 coronavirus patients in critical condition and 8,600 deaths by the end of the outbreak. A high infection rate, two people per patient, would send the number of critical cases soaring to 54,000 and the number of fatalities to 21,600.

> In contrast, according to the new report’s most pessimistic scenario, in the two years it would take to develop a vaccine, 100 people a day will fall ill. Even then, the number of patients would be small in comparison to the size of Israel’s population: “Less than 100,000 people infected and less than 1,000 fatalities by the end of the period.”
Related Articles

> The experts credited the government’s drastic action for the slowdown, saying that although “this slowdown could well be influenced by other factors,” it comes 10 to 12 days after major steps were taken to restrict movements, matching what has been seen in other regions in the world.
New confirmed cases.

> Critics disagree with that interpretation, with some saying that other countries – such as Japan, Germany and the Netherlands – experienced the same drop without adopting similar radical policies. As the disease spreads, the population develops a natural immunity, say the critics.

> In the past week, more and more people have called on the government to loosen restrictions, return the economy to a level of 40 to 50 percent of usual activity, and allow the population to develop herd immunity. But the NSC’s team of experts opposes easing the lockdown, saying that move would destroy the country’s ability to contain the epidemic and be a disaster for Israeli society.

> “A policy of ‘herd immunity’ requires the infection of a majority of the population, which means tens of thousands of deaths and hundreds of thousands of patients in serious condition,” they warn, “even under the unreasonable assumption that it is possible to isolate the elderly population from the young. The health system cannot handle an event of this nature.”

> “The slowdown that was observed, specifically the number of patients in serious condition and the number of deaths, matches the previous forecasts of the team of experts,” states the report. “It proves there is not a large number of unidentified [coronavirus] carriers among the population. It is therefore possible to state with a high degree of confidence that preserving the present policy of social isolation in the coming weeks will enable containment of the outbreak – in other words, a significant decrease in the rate of those infected with a few dozen deaths and hundreds of patients in serious condition.”

> The team was expected to submit its recommendations for an exit strategy on Thursday. For now, it says ""the existing isolation policy should be maintained, at least until a significant reduction in the number of new patients."" To end the lockdown, the report recommends to set a target for new cases, and determine a level at which it would be possible to “gradually get the economy back to work.” The aim is then to “preserve this situation over a long period of time, until a vaccine is developed.”"

I usually had either 1 or 0 friends. I was bullied a lot. I refused to do school work a lot and skipped a lot of school. From 7th-10th grade I was in a different school every year (in special classes and schools) and had to go to family court three times for truancy and was sent away twice. I quit when I was 16. I'm very introverted and just want to mostly stay at home and not be bothered. I have no interest in working, especially if it involves leaving the house or interacting with other people. I have no interest in having a romantic relationship. I just want to stay at home and find things to do at home that entertain or interest me until I'm dead.

If I actually wanted to go out and get a job it's unlikely anyone would hire me because I have no education past a ged, no work history, no references, and no car or driver's license. I would have to find a job that I could walk to or take the bus to as that is my only transportation. I never even had a chance to learn to drive. I grew up in a home where no one had a driver's license. I'm not social enough to bullshit my way through an interview and that makes things harder too.

I feel like if I tried to apply to a grocery store now maybe they would be desperate enough to hire me but I'm not going to do that because not only would I be scared of getting coronavirus myself but I also don't want to risk bringing it home to my mother. She is 65 and has copd."

>If there is no evidence because no one has studied it does that mean it isn’t a concern or shouldn’t at least be treated as a concern until proven otherwise?

We don't operate this way because it quickly becomes absurd. (Can beans cause schizophrenia? It hasn't been studied therefore don't eat beans until we know it's safe.) Much of what we know about SARS-COV-2 is based on what we know about viruses in general, including coronaviruses which humanity has dealt with since our inception. (15% of common colds are caused by coronaviruses.) This virus is novel, yes, a new virus within the coronavirus family, and novelty begs certain questions, but that doesn't mean we forget everything we know about viruses and start worrying about improbable transmission means. Respiratory viruses are primarily spread through breathing in a sufficient number of (active) viral units. With all the contact tracing that has happened around the world with 1 million infections for this specific virus, along with the trillions of dollars in the mix, most cases can be traced back to being near an infected person and not from frozen food at the supermarket. Moreover, and the key takeaway -- even if your groceries were to be infected (as improbable as that is), all you have to do is wash your hands and that's it. This virus doesn't have the magical properties of penetrating through unbroken skin or shedding radiation. If you have coronavirus on your hands, wash them with soap and water for 20 seconds, get a good scrub, and you're safe. If you're worried that your groceries may have SARS-COV-2 on them, were you worried they may have had HIV on them last week? No, that'd be absurd, and even if they did in an improbable twist of fate, it doesn't matter because you wouldn't rub a box from the supermarket into an open wound or stick your dirty fingers into an orifice. People should wash their hands frequently and thoroughly, that's really all it comes down to."

You could blatantly lie and say they made coronavirus budget cuts, you could obscure the truth and say you're not sure all the factors that went into their decision, or you could be honest. I don't have any experience on the opposite end of the hiring table, so I'm not really sure. But I think I would say something along these lines, which I believe is an honest answer that doesn't come off as you being a terrible employee:

""There are a lot of unique challenges that a startup environment presents. While I enjoyed a lot of them, it wasn't the most stable or conducive environment for best industry practices, mentorship and career growth. While I did learn a ton, the company ultimately was looking for someone more senior to drive the product forward. While I'm excited to learn and grow into that position, I need a company which can provide an environment that enables me to grow in my career.""

Once again, though, I'm not sure. I think you should either avoid answering that, or try to find someone who has experience in a managerial role to help answer that question honestly and with integrity."

COVID-19 Prompts Restrictions on Tourism and Mass Gatherings

BREVARD COUNTY, FL. – Based on a“Stay-at-Home” executive order from Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, and due to the spread and growing number of coronavirus cases in Brevard County, the Space Coast will close its doors to tourists and leisure travelers effective 12:01 a.m. Friday, April 3.

Until the governor’s Executive Order 20-91 (which also is in effect beginning at 12:01 a.m. Friday) expires, hotels, motels, short-term rentals,vacation rentals, recreational vehicle parks and campgrounds and other transient rentals, such as time shares, vacation rentals by owner, and Airbnb, will deny reservations, including those made in advance, to visitors and travelers from outside the county. Exceptions include business travelers who can produce a note from their employer, those who are working in Brevard County, local residents and residents who need to isolate away from a family member with coronavirus.

The Board also voted to restrict access to spoil islands and sandbars for all individuals in an effort to comply with Centers for Disease Control and Florida Department of Health recommendations on social distancing of 6 feet and to avoid gatherings of 10 or more people.

The Brevard County Commission voted 4-1 on Thursday to recommend to the Policy Group to put both responsive measures in place as part of the County Emergency Management Plan. Policy Group members include Brevard County Commission Chair Bryan Lober; County Manager Frank Abbate; County Attorney Eden Bentley; Brevard County Fire Rescue Chief Mark Schollmeyer; Public Safety Director Matt Wallace; Brevard County Sheriff Wayne Ivey; Brevard Health Department Administrator Maria Stahl; Brevard Public Schools Superintendent Mark Mullins; and Emergency Management Director Kimberly Prosser. The Policy Group approved both recommendations by unanimous vote.

Both actions Thursday followed reports from the Florida Department of Health that the number of those infected with coronavirus in Brevard County has reached 48 confirmations, with at least five of those travel related, and the doubling of those on mechanical ventilation over the past 48 hours"

That's the flu

> “Anything that we don’t feel we have sufficient information about feels like a threat,” said Lynn Bufka, senior director of practice research and policy at the American Psychological Association and an expert on anxiety. “The flu doesn’t feel novel. Most people’s experience with the flu is they’ve had it, they’ve recovered, it’s not a big deal — despite the fact that thousands of people die every year.”

They seem to be producing fewer fatalities among older people, who typically comprise most of the deaths during flu season, but they are hitting children hard. The current season does not appear to be as severe as 2017-2018, when the flu reached epidemic proportions and as many as 95,000 people died, according to CDC estimates. 

That's a lot of people...I didn't even realize that was a bad year for the flu, did you? 

&#x200B;

> But no amount of flu can mitigate public fear and interest in the new coronavirus, which is spreading inexorably out of China, where it has killed more than 200 people and infected more than 11,000. 

At the time of the article, whether due to Chinese censorship or not, this seemed relatively harmless to the rest of the world. China has billions of people so 11,000 is a tiny number and we've already learned that the flu has killed double that number in the past four months in the USA. 

>“I often get asked: ‘We have an influenza outbreak here, we have about 8,000 deaths already, 100,000 hospitalizations. Why are we paying such attention’ ” to coronavirus?

...and not the flu? 

Now, if Lenny were to be writing the same story today, I doubt he would take the same approach because the data he would have would be different. 

The folks in this sub like to say the MSM is inducing panic while pointing out that the MSM was dismissive in their coverage earlier in the year without acknowledging that Trump has made the exact same shift. 

Lots of people assumed this would stay in China or that China's publicized spread/containment would be replicated around the globe, and since China is so densely populated and the source of the outbreak, one could safely assume that countries with less density would see even less of an outbreak. 

I wrongly made that assumption.

I think going forward, I don't think that brokerages would improve on this as it is not economical to set up the capacity to handle something that only happens with a black swan probability.

It might be wiser to consider that during black swan events such as this, that when evaluating risks of certain trades, that this would have to be taken into consideration as it seems no matter what brokerage you go to, this will occur. I hardly doubt that any of the brokerages are also going to compensate in full the losses in not being able to execute the trades."

The total number of infections over time is going to look a lot like a [sigmoid curve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sigmoid_function). The middle point of a sigmoid curve is called the inflection point, and it corresponds to the moment R drops below 1.

In a world where we do nothing to stem the tide, the curve is going to max out at a high percentage of US population, something like 40 to 80%.

Taking more and more drastic measures brings down R ""artificially"", and combined with developing herd immunity we can bring the inflection point low enough that only 20-60% of people get infected, at the cost of drawing out the pandemic and concomitant economic crisis.

On the other hand, if today we take the measures needed to bring R < 1, then today is the inflection point, and today is the day we see half of all infections. Half of all deaths is going to be something like in two 2 weeks. In this scenario we could be having mid-to-high five digit deaths.

Otherwise, we're looking at an exponential curve until herd immunity develops and turns it into a sigmoid. For the duration of the exponential period, every day multiplies total number of deaths by a fixed amount. I'm making up numbers here, but maybe if we lose a week 5x as many people die, if we lose two weeks 25x as many people die, and if we lose a month something like 750x as many people die. Time is the enemy.

this will lead to decreased funding for pandemic response because nothing happened and rural votes are the only votes that matter because of how the house and senate is laid out geographically

We have low numbers of confirmed cases because we're not testing.  

We have high numbers of coronavirus attributed deaths because we're not testing.

If we don't test, then we don't distinguish coronavirus cases from non-cases.  As a result, we have no data on the number of asymptomatic cases, and our attributed deaths are inflated due to not distinguishing them from other potential causes."

The Wall Street Journal recently ran a story on this very topic. Bergamo is a city with 120,000 people that is located in the Bergamo province in Northern Italy.

In March, 2019 they reported 125 deaths in the city. 

In March, 2020 they reported 533 deaths overall. 

Out of those 533 deaths, only 201 were confirmed coronavirus deaths. 

That means that Bergamo had 227 more deaths than last year because of the strain on the healthcare system, which was caused by the coronavirus."
