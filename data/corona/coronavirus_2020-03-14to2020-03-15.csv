2020-03-14,Halexi,neoliberal,7,https://www.reddit.com/r/neoliberal/comments/fieigg/discussion_thread/fki7t6u/,"So [by request](https://www.reddit.com/r/neoliberal/comments/fieigg/discussion_thread/fki3tea/) and since we like to have some reasonable data here occasionally, here is an **effortpost about coronavirus:**

**Background**    

I am living in Norway, currently the country with the 2nd highest rate of infection per capita. Thursday night at 6pm the country functionally shut down except for retail shops. I was informed by my university Wednesday that I was likely exposed to coronavirus earlier in the week (in this case I was able to narrow it down to Tuesday based on the times I was in the room in question). Thursday morning I stocked up on supplies and hunkered down in my apartment. Yesterday, I started to develop a dry cough and general malaise, and that has continued into today, getting worse as they day has gone on.    

**My primary symptoms are:**     

* consistent dry cough that waxes and wanes in waves. It is especially bad with exposure to dry air (as I learned opening my window to vent out smoke from dinner earlier) and is alleviated well enough by humid air (like in the shower. I am very much looking forward to the rainstorm tomorrow).    
* full body exhaustion. It feels like I spent the day doing manual labor, but all the time    
* dehydration. My mouth is dry, my nose is so dry I'm getting nosebleeds, my throat is dry, my skin is dry. I need to pee maybe once every 4 or so hours and have pretty bad constipation. I have had 2 12oz cups of tea, a fruit smoothie, and 3/4 gallon of water over the course of 11 hours of wakefullness today and my thirst is still insatiable. I have no idea where the water is going.    

**I also experience, inconsistently:**    

* shortness of breath. This comes and goes, and seems unrelated to coughing. It is worst when I physically exert myself (ex climbing up the stairs). But sometimes I get bouts when I'm just sitting watching movies. It feels like I'm suffocating. This symptom SUCKS but is thankfully only lasts for 10-15 minutes and can be calmed by focusing elsewhere and drinking a large amount of water very quickly. This is the symptom that prompted me to contact my doctor whereas prior I had intended to just sweat the illness out without reporting.    
* chills. I'm alternating between cold, comfortable, and hot seemingly at random.    
* lack of will to move. This one seems strange, but it is listed as a common symptom for mild to moderate cases. Similar to depression, I just have no motivation to move, even if I need to go to the bathroom or eat.    

In all, this is not awful. I don't feel great, but if I didn't know about coronavirus, I'd assume I just had a chest-cold or something and while I'd have stayed home from class, probably would have continued to do things like shopping, meeting with friends, and light exercise in the gym. This is why this disease is spreading so rapidly.    

**What is the reporting structure like?**    

I had to fill out a form on my doctor's website to say I was experiencing the symptoms I listed above. I received an automated message saying that I would be reported in tomorrow's national statistics and to stand by for further instructions. Per the automated message, I am not permitted to leave my apartment, not even to take out the garbage, until 24 hours have passed since my last cough. I will not be tested for the disease unless I need medical serious attention, nor will I be tested as ""clean"" so recovery statistics you see online are probably not completely accurate.    

I am waiting to get official word from my doctor before reporting to my university. I have taken it on myself to contact classmates I have seen in the last week to let them know I am not feeling well and that they might have been exposed so they don't hear directly from the university.    

The university has services set up that will result in daily (online) checkins to ensure students are not in distress. There is a separate procedure for garbage pickup, and they will shop on my behalf for food supplies if needed. In all this is very good.

**TL:DR: I have corona, AMA**"

The teen suspect surrendered with his mother Friday and was charged with assault and aggravated harassment for kicking the 59-year-old victim to the ground earlier this week, police said.
The man was walking down Madison Ave. near E. 103rd St. when the teen kicked him from behind about 7:50 p.m. Monday and yelled ‚ÄúF--- you, Chinese coronavirus!‚Äù as the victim fell to the sidewalk, cops said.

The man suffered cuts to his knees and hands, but was otherwise uninjured, police said. Cops put out surveillance images of the suspect Thursday.

The teen is being charged as a juvenile. His name was not released because he is a minor, police said.
Meanwhile, cops in Queens are investigating another hate crime attack fueled by panic over the disease.

The 47-year-old Asian victim and his 10-year-old son were near the corner of 70th Ave. and Queens Blvd. in Elmhurst about 6:50 a.m. Thursday when a man wearing a camouflage coat and pants approached and asked why the dad wasn‚Äôt wearing a mask.

The suspect cursed at the victim then pushed his head before walking away. The victim was not harmed.

Thursday‚Äôs incident is the fourth attack against Asians to plague the city during the coronavirus crisis.
On Tuesday, a 23-year-old Asian woman was punched in the face in Midtown by another woman who demanded to know why she wasn‚Äôt wearing a mask.

On Mar. 4, an unhinged straphanger was caught on video spraying what looked like a bottle of Febreze at an Asian man on a Brooklyn train. No arrests have been made."

Originally I was going to write this as a response to a short thread between us talking about the reaction to SARS-COV 2 by the media and people in general compared to the 2009 H1N1 pandemic. He didnt seem to have an agenda and genuinely saw the events surrounding right now as simple overreaction, BUT it's clear there are many with political reasons to compare H1N1 and SARS COV 2 (will use COVID from here forward, I am aware COVID refers to the disease not the virus itself).¬†¬†

Certain groups have attempted to downplay the clear mishandling of the COVID pandemic by comparing it to seasonal flu as well as the 2009 pandemic. Repeatedly people have pointed at the number of deaths caused by influenza to suggest that the reaction to COVID is ridiculously overblown. ""Up to 60,000 people have died from this flu season in the US alone"", ""no one attacked Obama as harshly/people didnt react as extremely even after H1N1 killed 12,000 people"". Such comments are often followed or preceded by pointing to the current case count and death toll of COVID.¬†

Now many people have already pointed out basic flaws with such arguments, the most obvious being it makes no sense to compare the deaths of seasonal flu OR H1N1 over the course of an entire year to the short time COVID has been spreading.¬†

BUT some people have said even taking that into consideration, people were not freaking out as much during the H1N1 pandemic as what has happened recently.¬†

Im not old enough to remember the reaction to H1N1, but yes it is probably correct to say that the reaction is more extreme. What little reading I could do I'll get use to write as close to a fair comparison solely from a media perspective. I'll be comparing case totals from 1st confirmed case of swine flu to as close to 54 days after that first confirmed case. I chose 54 days as it's the number of days it has been since the first confirmed case of COVID was reported. To have more data samples, I'm counting 54 days from first cases confirmed in Italy and South Korea as well; this is to have a better picture of the spread given the lack of testing in the US as well as getting an idea of what COVID could become based on the difference in response between South Korea and Italy. I'm not including China due to the lack of reliable info on the early spread of COVID.¬†

The CDC confirmed the first case of swine flu H1N1 on April 17, 2009 (CDC). There were 3000 cases of H1N1 confirmed and 3 deaths on May 12, 2009, 25 days after the first confirmed case (Univ. Of MN). By June 2, 2009 there were at least 17000 cases confirmed and over 100 dead worldwide, 46 days after the first confirmed case (Reuters). By June 10, the WHO reported 26563 cases worldwide, and 140 dead, 52 days after the first confirmed case (TIME).

The first confirmed case of SARS COV 2 in the US was on Jan 20, 2020 (New England Journal of Medicine). As of March 14 2020 theres been 2170 cases confirmed and 48 deaths in the US alone, 54 days after the first confirmed case in the US (New York Times).

The first two confirmed cases of COVID in Italy were on Jan 31, 2020. On Feb 22, 2020 the first death from COVID occurred, 22 days after the first confirmed case. (Corrier della Serra) As of today, 17660 cases have been confirmed and 1266 deaths, (Aljazeera), 42 days since the first confirmed case of COVID in Italy.¬†

The first case of COVID in Korea was confirmed on Jan 24, 2020. As of March 11 2020 there were 7800 cases confirmed and 61 deaths, 46 days from the first confirmed case. (Wikipedia).

To me it makes sense that there is a more extreme reaction to COVID than there was with H1N1. Now again I do fully understand the point that many people are overreacting, but closing of schools etc isn't an overreaction, its proper action.¬†

Children can be carriers and especially in a school environment multipliers. Children aren't high risk, but that's not why schools are being closed. It's to prevent the spread to people significantly more vulnerable.¬†

Beating people with wine bottles is overreaction.
Stocking up on enough toilet paper for an elephant is overreaction.¬†
Closing schools and postponing events isnt.

No, it's not the end of the world. But people need to seriously stop with this ""it's just a flu, it's just a cold mutation"" bullshit as you are factually incorrect.

1. Incubation period of 2-14 days, people can unknowingly spread it for days
2. Infection rate higher than the flu but difficult to see due to asymptomatic carriers and long incubation period

4. The symptoms largely affect older individuals with health problems sparing the young while using them as vectors to reach distant locations
5. Mortality rate is low enough, that fear of death only impacts a small number of individuals

When immigration officials rolled out their [‚Äúpublic charge‚Äù rule last month](https://www.miamiherald.com/news/local/immigration/article240486616.html), people who were sick were deemed a ‚Äúburden‚Äù to the U.S. and their health conditions were counted against them when applying for a green card.

Late Friday, however, part of that changed‚Äî at least when it comes to coronavirus, [United States Citizenship and Immigration Services announced](https://www.uscis.gov/greencard/public-charge). Any immigrant who gets tested or treated for the virus will not be negatively impacted.

‚ÄúUSCIS encourages all those, including aliens, with symptoms that resemble coronavirus (COVID-19) (fever, cough, shortness of breath) to seek necessary medical treatment or preventive services,‚Äù [the agency said in a statement](https://www.uscis.gov/greencard/public-charge). ‚ÄúSuch treatment or preventive services will not negatively affect any alien as part of a future public charge analysis.‚Äù

The agency continued: ‚ÄúTo address the possibility that some aliens impacted by COVID-19 may be hesitant to seek necessary medical treatment or preventive services, USCIS will neither consider testing, treatment, nor preventative care (including vaccines, if a vaccine becomes available) related to COVID-19 as part of a public charge inadmissibility determination, nor as related to the public benefit condition applicable to certain nonimmigrants seeking an extension of stay or change of status, even if such treatment is provided or paid for by one or more public benefits, as defined in the rule (e.g. federally funded Medicaid).‚Äù

[Fear among immigrant communities](https://www.miamiherald.com/news/local/immigration/article240805776.html) nationwide to get tested for the virus if symptoms developed has been rampant, advocates say. People in line for green card considerations have worried that if contracting the virus and seeking treatment for it would impact their chances of getting their permanent residency in the U.S."

As regions of the U.S. begin to mandate public closures and self-quarantine, we are equipping our restaurants to serve our guests via drive-thru and delivery only where necessary.‚ÄØShould we need to‚ÄØtemporarily close‚ÄØour dining rooms, we would be limiting millions of guest interactions‚ÄØand further enabling‚ÄØsocial distancing. We are going to redefine what it means to be a social brand during this coronavirus pandemic, while at the same time keeping our team members safe, and continuing to provide our fans with the delicious Taco Bell food they love.

We aim to be the safest place to eat AND the safest place to work.‚ÄØOur 7,200 managers are well-trained and prepared, and we‚Äôre going back to them to revisit our existing‚ÄØindustry-leading training and operating procedures. Their‚ÄØpersonal well-being, safe food preparation, restaurant cleanliness and illness policies‚ÄØare our top priorities and are‚ÄØbest practices from our operators from around the globe.‚ÄØ

Because our people are the heart of our organization, and we understand the impact these actions can have,‚ÄØwe‚Äôre amending our sick policy‚ÄØat our company-owned U.S. restaurants‚ÄØto better accommodate our teams while ensuring no one works who is sick.‚ÄØWe‚Äôll be paying employees who are required to‚ÄØstay at home, or who work at a restaurant that is closed, for their scheduled or regularly scheduled hours during their‚ÄØtime away from work. We‚Äôre actively working with our franchise partners to encourage a similar approach.

He was in bed, recovering from something like a severe flu. (He had tested flu-negative, which was unusual ‚Äî and what motivated her research.) They talked over email and WhatsApp and the phone about the grim situation evolving in Wuhan, China, where the virus originated.

‚ÄúIn mid- to late January we started developing a plan for our family in case one of us became infected, and preparing supplies for two weeks of isolation,‚Äù she said. They also started calculating the numbers and sharing frustrations over their inability to convey to people the seriousness of the coronavirus‚Äôs exponential spread.

‚ÄúWe were listening to people, such as President Trump, saying, ‚ÄòWhat‚Äôs the fuss, it‚Äôs just like the flu,‚Äô and ‚ÄòThere are only 15 cases, and only one death in the U.S., much fewer than everywhere else, we‚Äôre doing great,‚Äô‚Äù Dr. Nick Jewell said. ‚ÄúBut every epidemiologist knew what was coming inexorably toward us.‚Äù

On Tuesday, they noticed a [tweet by Mike Baker](https://twitter.com/bymikebaker/status/1237588549362278400?s=12) of The New York Times, in which he noted the cumulative number of coronavirus cases in the U.S. by date:

Jan. 14 ‚Äî 0

Jan. 21 ‚Äî 1

Jan. 28 ‚Äî 5

Feb. 4 ‚Äî 11

Feb. 11 ‚Äî 14

Feb. 18 ‚Äî 25

Feb. 25 ‚Äî 59

Mar. 3 ‚Äî 125

Mar. 10 ‚Äî 1,004

‚ÄúThat is exponential growth,‚Äù Dr. Nick Jewell said. (He noted that the latest increase was also likely a reflection of increased testing.)

‚ÄúWe started discussing what actions to take in the face of exponential growth,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúObviously, we need to slow the rate of growth ([flatten the curve](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/11/science/coronavirus-curve-mitigation-infection.html)) through government and individual responses ‚Äî effectively based on increased testing and heightened social distancing. But in order to accomplish that, we first need to convince people to take this outbreak seriously, which is no small task. It‚Äôs as if humans can only think linearly. But for epidemic modelers, exponential growth is the very nature of the beast.‚Äù

Dr. Britta Jewell wondered whether the power of exponential growth could be turned to a collective advantage. ‚ÄúThe answer was yes, but only if we intervene early,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúThat means now.‚Äù

The exponential effect was now on other minds as well. Yaneer Bar-Yam, a physicist and systems scientist and the founding president of the New England Complex Systems Institute, convened a YouTube chat with Nassim Nicholas Taleb, a probability fl√¢neur and risk analyst, to discuss ‚Äú[Why It‚Äôs Better to Panic Early](https://www.youtube.com/watch?reload=9&v=e2Kga5HeAqk),‚Äù following up on [a paper](https://necsi.edu/systemic-risk-of-pandemic-via-novel-pathogens-coronavirus-a-note) they put out in late January. And on Tuesday, Tomas Pueyo, a Silicon Valley entrepreneur, posted what amounted to a lengthy white paper on Medium titled, ‚Äú[Coronavirus: Why You Must Act Now](https://medium.com/@tomaspueyo/coronavirus-act-today-or-people-will-die-f4d3d9cd99ca),‚Äù which has been viewed 18 million times already.

‚ÄúThe graph that really grabbed my attention was the one showing a model of daily new cases of Covid-19 with social-distancing measures starting just one day apart,‚Äù Dr. Britta Jewell said. ‚ÄúIt only takes a one-day difference in action to see a 40 percent reduction in cases ‚Äî that‚Äôs enormous. It really conveys the urgency of the situation.‚Äù"

1. STAY AT HOME!  Go out only for essentials.  Remember that even if you are young and the critical risks are low, if you become infected, you are a vector for the more vulnerable among us.
2. If you have to go out, practice social distancing... 6 ft or more from others.  Good hand washing, and only touch your facr with freshly washed hands (and then wash them afterward)
3. Stop hoarding supplies...we all need regular supplies to stay home.  You don't need 2 months of food and staples at a time.
4. Stop hoarding PPE. Hospitals are running low on these supplies and some doctors offices have none.  As a pulmonologist, I always have surgical and N95 masks, but I don't have enough for a prolonged outbreak and all the orders I place a month ago are back-ordered and unavailable.
5. Call your doctors office before showing up with a fever and cough.  It is better that they treat you empirically for what you may have than showing up and causing the entire clinic to have to close for Quarantine purposes.  If you worsen at home you can then go to the ER where they are set up more efficiently to isolate you.
6. Refrain from posting analyses of the Coronavirus on social media generated by political pundits  and YouTubers who have ""done their research""...most of this is crap and ideologically driven.  It is misinformation that will only hurt the battle for control.
7. Don't call doctors, hospitals, health departments, etc demanding COVID-19 testing if you are asymptomatic.  This takes time away from important work.  US testing is currently a cluster-fuck for a number of administrative and supply reasons, but will eventually get on line, and in the future, should be able to accomodate on-demand testing.
8. Understand that the medical community is working feverishly to understand the virus and the disease, but there is an enormous amount we don't know and cannot answer.  Therefore the best thing for the average person to do to help with the pandemic is to STAY HOME!!!"

2020-03-14,IBitchSLAPYourASS,lostgeneration,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/lostgeneration/comments/finoud/two_sides_of_the_same_coin/fki9003/,"House Speaker Nancy Pelosi on Friday night celebrated the coronavirus legislation that passed early Saturday as providing paid sick leave to American workers affected by the pandemic.
She neglected to mention the fine print.
In fact, the bill guarantees sick leave only to about 20 percent of workers. Big employers like McDonald‚Äôs and Amazon are not required to provide any paid sick leave, while companies with fewer than 50 employees can seek hardship exemptions from the Trump administration.

‚ÄúIf you are sick, stay home,‚Äù Vice President Mike Pence said at a news conference on Saturday afternoon. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not going to miss a pay check.‚Äù
But that‚Äôs simply not true. Sick workers should stay home, but there is no guarantee in the emergency legislation that most of them will get paid.

The White House and congressional Republicans, who insisted on the exemptions as the price of bipartisan support for the legislation, bear the primary responsibility for the indefensible decision to prioritize corporate profits in the midst of a public health emergency.

Instead of pressing executives to support a comprehensive sick leave law, President Trump held a Rose Garden pep rally for corporate America on Friday afternoon, showering praise on the chief executives of big employers including Walmart, Target and Walgreens.

But House Democrats also failed to act in the public interest. Paying sick workers to stay at home is both good policy and good politics. Why not pass a bill that required all employers to provide paid sick leave and then force Republicans to explain their objections to the public?

The bill does require some employers to provide full-time workers with up to 10 days of paid leave. But the requirement does not apply to the nation‚Äôs largest employers ‚Äî companies with 500 or more workers, who together employ roughly 54 percent of all workers.

After a Waffle House employee tested positive for the coronavirus earlier this month, the company refused to promise it would pay other sick workers to stay home. Now, under the new bill, it would qualify for the big-company exemption. Would Ms. Pelosi please explain why the House decided not to require Waffle House to protect its workers and customers by paying for sick leave?

The legislation also provides some compensation for workers who need to take longer leaves under the Family and Medical Leave Act ‚Äî but this too excludes workers at big companies.

And the bill allows the Labor Department to grant hardship exemptions to businesses with fewer than 50 employees. That category includes another 26 percent of the work force, meaning that fully 80 percent of workers may not be able to cash in on Ms. Pelosi‚Äôs rhetoric.

Democrats began this process in the right place. The first draft of the coronavirus legislation included a permanent change requiring employers to allow every worker to earn up to seven days of paid sick leave, and a temporary change allowing any worker to take up to 10 days of sick leave during a public health emergency. The final draft includes only a pale shadow of those sensible requirements. The paid sick leave requirement is narrowly focused on the coronavirus; it does not even require paid sick leave during future pandemics ‚Äî a contemptible signal that political leaders are already committed to not learning the lessons of this one.

Some large employers have announced voluntary grants of paid sick leave for workers affected by the coronavirus. After a Walmart employee in Kentucky tested positive for the coronavirus, the company announced it would provide up to two weeks of paid leave for workers who fall ill or are quarantined because of a confirmed exposure to the virus. Other large employers, including Target, Gap and Wawa, have made similar announcements.

But such voluntary policies are an inadequate substitute for legislation. Many large employers have not announced any changes, many of the policies that have been announced are considerably less generous than the requirements of the House legislation, and employees at those firms can hardly enforce corporate compliance with a news release.

It‚Äôs also true that big employers are generally more likely to offer standard sick leave benefits. Roughly 86 percent of workers at big companies get some kind of paid sick leave, according to federal statistics. But few workers in the United States are eligible to take 10 days of paid sick leave. And the low-wage workers who can least afford to stay home without paid leave are precisely the workers who are least likely to qualify for those standard corporate benefits.

Companies should be required provide paid sick leave to every worker as a standard cost of doing business, and they certainly should be required to do so in the midst of a pandemic.

The House‚Äôs failure to require universal paid sick leave is an embarrassment that endangers the health of workers, consumers and the broader American public."

Soren's family was new to a planet so they were having trouble adjusting to the new bacteria and pathogens that were present.

>Dr. Halsey glanced at the holographic files displayed discreetly on the interior of her glasses. His mother had apparently succumbed to a planet-specific disease. Treatments were readily available, but a family living off the grid wouldn‚Äòt have been aware of that. Instead of reporting immediately to the planetary officials as was required by law, the boy‚Äòs parents had dismissed the symptoms as those of a cold and had kept working. A few days later, the mother was dead and the stepfather sick. Soren, perhaps because his younger immune system had adapted more readily to Dwarka, had never become ill. He had, according to his stepfather‚Äòs dying wish, buried the bodies of both of his parents, then continued to live on in their farmhouse until supplies were almost gone, finally setting out by foot to cross 112 kilometers of blue-gray forest and arrive at the beginning of authorized farmland.

\- Halo Evolutions, Pariah

Humanity was pretty on top of that whenever they could be, so I imagine that cross species pathogens likely weren't that much of an issue since they've been exposed to so many new species and worlds. Natural bacteria and illness the covenant would have likely weren't that much of an issue to humanity in the 26th century.

One battle maybe in the beginning of the Human-Covenant war... Maybe, but I imagine that would be enough for Humanity to eradicate it or become immune to it.

And I guess to ease the fears of other current events things that are going on(this is the third thread i've seen on here?), so long as you keep proper hygiene, you should be all good. 

If you do get it, try to keep the fever down like the flu, recoveries say they treated it like the flu. [Vaccines are already being synthesized from the recovered.](https://www.google.com/search?q=corona+vaccine&rlz=1C1NDCM_enUS862US862&oq=Corona+vaccine&aqs=chrome.0.0l8.2975j0j7&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8)

Statistically, you have a [roughly 93% chance](https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/) of surviving it un-vaccinated since it's essentially a different strand of the flu. The symptoms are basically the same. Most of those statistics aren't even from the United States, which means you have an even higher chance of living if you live in the USA.

Believe it or not, [the yearly flu is even worse than that...](https://www.cdc.gov/flu/about/burden/index.html)

Why is this significant?

**Le chef de l‚ÄôEtat a d√©cid√© de maintenir les √©lections municipales en s‚Äôappuyant sur des expertises scientifiques qu‚Äôil n‚Äôa pas rendues publiques**

Par Franck Nouchi Publi√© aujourd‚Äôhui √† 17h55 

Sur quelles bases scientifiques, m√©dicales, √©pid√©miologiques, la strat√©gie actuelle de lutte contre l‚Äô√©pid√©mie de coronavirus a-t-elle √©t√© mise en ≈ìuvre en France et, plus g√©n√©ralement, en Europe ? Pourquoi les autorit√©s sanitaires ont-elles, dans ces pays, d√©cid√© de ne suivre ni les recommandations de l‚ÄôOMS, ni l‚Äôexemple chinois de lutte contre l‚Äô√©pid√©mie ? En d√©cidant de laisser l‚Äô√©pid√©mie suivre son cours et de ne pas tenter de l‚Äôarr√™ter brutalement, les pouvoirs publics fran√ßais, sans le dire, acceptent l‚Äôid√©e qu‚Äôune part importante de la population va √™tre, dans les prochains mois, infect√©e par le coronavirus. Avec √† la cl√©, √† tout le moins, probablement, des dizaines de milliers de personnes d√©c√©d√©es dans l‚ÄôHexagone. Une telle strat√©gie, encore une fois non avou√©e mais de facto mise en ≈ìuvre, ne devrait-elle pas √™tre √† tout le moins discut√©e ?

On sait aujourd‚Äôhui pas mal de choses sur la maladie √† coronavirus 2019 (Covid-19), maladie infectieuse caus√©e par le coronavirus SARS-CoV-2. Son taux de mortalit√© est de 20 √† 30 fois sup√©rieur √† celui de la grippe saisonni√®re. Tr√®s contagieux, le SARS-CoV-2 est sensible aux d√©sinfectants usuels. En France, le diagnostic sp√©cifique de la COVID-19 est r√©alis√© actuellement par une m√©thode de biologie mol√©culaire (RT-PCR sp√©cifique) sur un √©couvillonnage nasopharyng√© dont le r√©sultat est obtenu en 24 heures. Aucun test commercial simple n‚Äôest actuellement disponible.

Le SARS-CoV- 2 infecte toutes les classes d‚Äô√¢ge, mais de fa√ßon diff√©renci√©e. 87 % des patients ont entre 30 et 79 ans, alors que moins de 1 % sont dans la classe d‚Äô√¢ge inf√©rieure √† 10 ans. La fr√©quence des formes s√©v√®res et le taux de mortalit√© augmentent avec l‚Äô√¢ge (15 % chez les patients de plus de 80 ans et 8 % chez les patients entre 70 et 79 ans).

**Deux strat√©gies**

Lors de l‚Äôapparition des premiers ¬´ clusters ¬ª sur le sol fran√ßais, une premi√®re strat√©gie a √©t√© mise en ≈ìuvre. Il est alors apparu que le diagnostic pr√©coce, y compris chez des patients asymptomatiques, permettait d‚Äôidentifier et d‚Äôisoler tr√®s t√¥t les sujets porteurs dans des conditions appropri√©es en termes de confinement et d‚Äôacceptation psychologique. Ces mesures ont √©t√© appliqu√©es, par exemple dans la station de ski des Contamines-Montjoie (Haute-Savoie), avec une efficacit√© remarquable.

Les Chinois n‚Äôont rien fait d‚Äôautre, mais √† une √©chelle beaucoup, beaucoup plus large. D√®s lors qu‚Äôils ont cess√© de nier l‚Äôexistence-m√™me de l‚Äô√©pid√©mie, ils ont mis en ≈ìuvre un d√©pistage rapide des cas infect√©s avec un isolement des cas symptomatiques non encore test√©s et la mise en quarantaine de leurs contacts. Ces mesures ont √©t√© maintenues et renforc√©es jusqu‚Äô√† la fin de l‚Äô√©pid√©mie dans le Hubei, ce qui a permis d‚Äôy √©teindre l‚Äô√©pid√©mie. L‚Äôarr√™t complet des d√©placements √† partir de cette r√©gion vers les autres r√©gions chinoises √† permis √† la Chine d‚Äôy contr√¥ler tr√®s efficacement les ¬´ d√©parts de feux ¬ª secondaires. Il ne s‚Äòest donc jamais agit en Chine d‚Äôune strat√©gie de ¬´ phase ¬ª ou les premi√®res mesures sont remplac√©es par les suivantes avec un train de retard, mais d‚Äôune strat√©gie coh√©rente impliquant des approches compl√©mentaires et pas successives.

En France, comme dans la plupart des pays europ√©ens, il a √©t√© d√©cid√© que cette strat√©gie n‚Äôavait plus cours. On laisse filer les choses de mani√®re √† esp√©rer voir se mettre en place une ¬´ immunit√© de groupe ¬ª. En clair, attendre qu‚Äôune bonne partie de la population ait √©t√© infect√©e, et donc vraisemblablement immunis√©e, pour esp√©rer voir s‚Äôinterrompre la transmission du virus. Pourquoi, et dans quelles conditions, a-t-on d√©cid√© de renoncer √† la strat√©gie mise en place en Chine ? A-t-on compl√®tement mesur√© les cons√©quences, en termes de morbidit√© et de mortalit√© d‚Äôune telle strat√©gie ?

¬´ Pour sauver des vies, nous devons r√©duire la transmission. Cela signifie qu‚Äôil faut trouver et isoler le plus grand nombre de cas possibles, et mettre en quarantaine leurs contacts les plus proches ¬ª, vient de d√©clarer le directeur g√©n√©ral de l‚ÄôOMS, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus avant d‚Äôajouter : ¬´ M√™me si vous ne pouvez pas arr√™ter la transmission, vous pouvez la ralentir et prot√©ger les √©tablissements de sant√©, les maisons de retraite et d‚Äôautres espaces vitaux ‚Äì mais seulement si vous testez tous les cas suspects ¬ª. A l‚Äô√©vidence, aujourd‚Äôhui, de nombreux pays, √† commencer par la France, ont renonc√© √† tester ¬´ tous les cas suspects ¬ª. Et, par voie de cons√©quence, √† isoler les cas-contacts potentiellement contamin√©s.


**Quels arguments scientifiques ?**

Les pouvoirs publics font valoir qu‚Äôils ne font que se fier aux avis des ¬´ experts ¬ª. Probl√®me : ces avis demeurent confidentiels. Personne ou presque ne sait sur quoi ils reposent. Un exemple ? Durant toute la journ√©e qui a pr√©c√©d√© l‚Äôintervention t√©l√©vis√©e du pr√©sident de la R√©publique, des rumeurs ont couru dans Paris. Pour des raisons de sant√© publiques √©videntes, le chef de l‚ÄôEtat allait annoncer le report des √©lections municipales. Quelques heures plus tard, revirement complet. A √©couter Emmanuel Macron, les ¬´ experts ¬ª ayant affirm√© qu‚Äôil n‚Äôy avait pas de risques, le scrutin devait √™tre maintenu.

Avant d‚Äôaller voter pour le second tour dans un environnement √©pid√©miologique qui se sera, malheureusement, consid√©rablement aggrav√©, les citoyens-√©lecteurs, ne seraient-ils pas en droit de conna√Ætre les d√©tails de l‚Äôargumentation des scientifiques qui conseillent les pouvoirs publics ? Sans quoi, il y a fort √† parier que nombre d‚Äôentre eux pr√©f√©reront voter avec leurs pieds. En n‚Äôallant pas voter."

I will likely never know what I'm sick with  because none of Ottawa's criteria qualify me for testing. The good news is that if what I have is indeed coronavirus, the symptoms feel like a very mild cold. Normally I'd be out and about with such mild symptoms, but I'm being extra cautious, all things considered, and encourage everyone to also take extra precautions at all times, as silly and overreactive as it seems.

As has been pointed out before, even after a country adopts complete lock down, it takes about two weeks for daily increases in cases and deaths to peak because those cases already exist in the population, but cannot be tested because of incubation period. The following article posted several days ago explains this by re-examining China's data, which shows at the point of lock down / quarantine, the real number was more than 10 times the reported number, and it would take about two weeks for testing / hospitalisation to catch up with the real number.

If everyone is covering up their face when they sneeze or cough, and everyone is washing their hands properly (which is far more effective than sanitizer) you're not likely to get it. The way people get it is when droplets from a cough or sneeze get onto someone or onto a surface and then transferred to the person's face via touching that surface. Like you said, no government is recommending to self quarantine unless you suspect you have the virus.

Once all this is over are people going to keep using good hygiene practices or are we going to go back to not washing our hands and sneezing out into the air in public places?"

The number of positives from the number of cases are on trend suggesting we *could* have close to 50% of the population infected and either not being tested, or not showing symptoms as of yet. People seem to be more interested in the number of presumptive positive cases than considering exponential growth. I think, in my opinion, everyone should just assume they have it if they are sick and are experiencing all of the symptoms of coronavirus. What good does the test do other than confirming what you already know? Yes, it provides factual information for the CDC, but that person insistent on being tested is overwhelming our healthcare system even more and coming into contact with even more people when they leave their home to go to the hospital or doctor‚Äôs office. The test will confirm the patient is positive, but there isn‚Äôt an antiviral or cure for this. Patients who can recover on their own will be sent home - where they probably should have remained to begin with. The people who are carrying on with their lives like nothing is wrong are being socially irresponsible.

2020-03-14,benjaminikuta,neoliberal,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/neoliberal/comments/fieigg/discussion_thread/fki8134/,"Covid-19 is hard to think about. It's hard to feel the individual risk when you know many people don't get sick. And it's really hard to act based on exponential growth.

This isn‚Äôt an Internet issue per se, but it is a place where urgent collective action is extremely important, so we felt called to act.

It‚Äôs personal too. Most of us at Fight for the Future have older parents who are very much at risk of hospitalization or death. So we wanted to send you these two points to help you think about Covid-19 and what to do about it:

1. It‚Äôs not obvious that this is true, but you're probably in more danger from Covid-19 than you are from anything else in your daily life.

The best estimate we have says there‚Äôs a 0.4% death rate for someone in their 40s. It could be lower, but that‚Äôs what it seems to have been in Hubei.1 As a 40-year-old, I might hear this, or hear that the vast majority of people who die are older than me, and feel safe. The thing is, nothing I ever do in daily life has a 0.4% death rate. Fighting in a war or living in a war zone has a similar death rate. If suddenly normal life becomes 0.4% fatal (or more to someone over 60) and we don‚Äôt change our behavior, that‚Äôs a big mistake. Changes make total sense.

In the same way, someone younger than me might hear that no one their age has died and feel indestructible. The problem is, even if you don't die, a bad case of Covid-19 is not something you want to go through.2 You get sedated and put on a machine that forces your lungs to breathe. In Italy, people as young as 18 required intensive care.3 Even if you are 25 or 40, big steps to protect yourself make sense, and if you are older this is even more true.

2. Exponential growth means that it's completely prudent to cancel or pause every public gathering we can, including school, even if this causes severe strain or inconvenience.

In Italy Covid-19 deaths grew at ~7x per week.4 Let's look at what that means in a hypothetical region with 100 free ICU beds with ventilators. (And that‚Äôs a lot, by the way.)

Week #1: you have 1 serious case needing an ICU bed and a ventilator. No problem.

Week #2: you have 7 serious cases. No serious problem.

Week #3: you have 49 serious cases. Now you‚Äôre at half capacity. Things are starting to get hectic, but life still seems normal. People get the care they need.

Week #4: you have 343 cases. In just 7 days this has become a crisis. People now cannot get the care they need, including for other emergencies like strokes, car accidents, and heart attacks. Doctors now have to choose between caring for a 40 year old mother of two, a healthy 25 year old, and 35-year-old who's pregnant. (This is happening in Italy now.5) Your only way to get these people treatment is to move massive numbers of critically ill people to other cities that haven‚Äôt been hit yet. This is happening in Italy too, but it‚Äôs hard.

Week #5: 2,401 cases for 100 beds. Statistically, your hospitals barely even exist at this point. Moving that many people will be near impossible even if there is room for them elsewhere.
If you want to prevent needless death, the experience in China and now Italy shows you need to take dramatic steps to slow growth *before* the situation looks really bad. That's very hard for policymakers (hence the disasters in China and Italy) so, right now, how this unfolds and how many die depends on you.

What are things you can do to slow the spread of the virus before things get bad?

The obvious meta answer is, advocate for doing what Italy did‚Äîbut for doing it now, rather than doing it too late.

Italy closed schools and noncritical public places like bars and restaurants, too late.

Can you and the people you love convince your city to do this before it‚Äôs too late?

To proceed, instead of a single action or petition, here are some campaigns written by people who seem to know more about this than us. Visit them, make decisions, and, of course, share this email and these campaigns widely. Hustle. When facing exponential growth of death, every day matters.

Read, share & do: https://flattenthecurve.com/

Read, share & do: https://staythefuckhome.com/

Call local school departments and request that they close. (See P.S.)
Stay engaged, this thing matters,

Holmes, Joe, Sarah, Evan, and the Fight for the Future team.

P.S. We‚Äôve heard epidemiological and political arguments against closing schools and, to us as parents and activists, it seems all families‚Äîespecially the most vulnerable‚Äîwill be safer from medical and economic hardship if schools are closed. There is still an active debate about this perspective, including within our team, but these are some reasons to consider it: First, kids appear to get infected at the same rate as adults.6 Second, any parent has direct personal experience of how many viral infections kids acquire and bring into the household when they first enter school. Finally, many US children live with‚Äîor are cared for primarily by‚Äîolder relatives, who are very much at risk and whose hospitalization or death would be catastrophic for a family.7 Right now a family trying to protect an aging caregiver from infection could face legal action for keeping kids home from school‚Äîthat‚Äôs wrong. In many regions, week-long school closures happen every few years due to weather events like snow & ice storms, forest fires, or heat waves‚Äîthis isn‚Äôt unprecedented and parents expect it to a degree. The risk faced by school staff in their 50s and 60s is another important factor. Meanwhile, work to address specific economic hardships can, and must, happen in parallel either way: workers in many industries will have problems making rent and mortgage payments over coming weeks and months, whether or not schools close. Italy has suspended mortgage payment requirements, that‚Äôs an example of the level of intervention we‚Äôll likely need given the drop in economic activity; keeping schools open will achieve less and less as many businesses shut down.8

We still don't know much about the virus, so it's better to take precautions about it especially since we don't have enough medical supplies or doctors to treat every serious case. But I do agree that people are blowing this way out of proportion, mainly because a lot of people don't know anything about it and don't bother to do research, so they just spread misinformation and freak out about it online instead. And the whole stockpiling toilet paper because they think it's gonna run out is just a self-fulfilling prophecy. People are acting like this is the apocalypse, but if anything, it would probably be because of the way people are are reacting to the Coronavirus, not because of the virus itself."

For that is exactly what it is.

Thus the reaction -- the Chinese certainly had plans in place from the previous SARS outbreak, as it was a near certainty it will happen again.

The problem is that they also remembered how they got hurt economically back then, so they decided to try to hide it. Thus the linguistic games being played (calling it anything else but ""SARS"") and the attempt to cover it up.

Testing for something like Coronavirus uses a procedure called RT-PCR, which stands for reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction.

The problem is that performing this test at a small scale is trivial; I could probably do it in my own lab (even though this is now what we normally do) armed with just the knowledge of the virus‚Äô genome sequence, which is public information.  But scaling up for samples that don‚Äôt come from a lab environment is HARD. The test is very labor intensive and is not high throughput. It will take about a half day to do under most circumstances.

For one thing, there's no vaccine against the coronavirus. For another, it is highly contagious. (Though at least, they didn't fall for the amateur trap of comparing the virus to non-contagious diseases like cancer or other causes of death like road accidents.)

Apart from that they did not really say anything wrong. They didn't say it wouldn't become epidemic of this scale. On the contrary, I remember Steve saying that the cases will multiply quickly that by the time the episode was on air, the number would be utterly out of date.

That said, this is one scenario where we should have erred on the side of extreme precaution. I think many countries were slow to respond partly because experts tried to be too quasi-rational about it."

which isn't a *completely* insane take. say the repos expire, and the banks fail to pay the money back. the fed has to sell off the securities, but... how? if the whole world is dying of coronavirus, who's going to buy them? theres clearly a liquidity shortage, hence the repos being offered in the first place. if that happens (and i'm not smart enough to say how likely it is), the system starts looking less robust.

that's why he's pointing to these repo offerings as a symptom of a larger problem. if the economy can grind to a halt because everyone's leant their assets to each other, and used the cash to borrow assets from each other... maybe they should just cut the proverbial gordian knot.

While I was reading your message, this NYTimes article popped up - https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/14/technology/coronavirus-gouging-sanitizer.html

TL;DR - Sellers cleaned up offline store shelves with only motivation to sell them for multiples of what they bought them for on Amazon. The prices massively spiked on Amazon making it unaffordable until Amazon cracked down.

Result - Inconclusive for me. Would the prices have dropped down after spiking so much? Possibly, but only until there was no arbitrage to gain from. On the same hand, cracking down on the price housers resulted in the items going out of stock and the sellers still hoarding items. In an efficient market, the hoarders should have panic sold them resulting in cheaper prices? But it didn‚Äôt happen as well.

Honestly, it‚Äôs a very complex behavioral issue. Price bands and caps at least give a guidance for sellers to stick to instead of these artificial fluctuations and that appears to be a win to me. I can certainly understand the supply side of the argument but in an inefficient market what works in theory is not what happens in the market though."

Preventing contact with the elderly and immunosuppressed are of course key.

The public reaction thanks to irresponsible media coverage and misinformation is what gets me, because it's led to unnecessary reactions like this. I think people just get off on the idea of a doomsday scenario so they do dumb shit.

> 
>  
> 
>  Desde el Ministerio de Defensa, allegados a **Agust√≠n Rossi** confirmaron a Infobae que no est√° previsto por el momento un env√≠o de uniformados a las fronteras para reforzar los controles sanitarios, aunque explicaron que los militares est√°n trabajando en un plan para que varios laboratorios de las Fuerzas Armadas fabrique alcohol en gel para repartir a poblaciones vulnerables del pa√≠s como medidas preventivas. En rigor, no est√° definido a√∫n en qu√© zonas y √°reas se distribuir√° ese insumo necesario para erradicar los g√©rmenes del coronavirus.

No est√° definido a√∫n la forma de distribuci√≥n de este insumo preventivo de g√©rmenes, pero est√° claro que en el Gobierno advierten que se tratar√° de un producto faltante ante un aumento de la pandemia en la Argentina.

*The lessons from 1918 are stark. First, the public health response to the spread of the disease must focus on containment. The reason why the 1918 pandemic resulted in so many deaths was that so many people caught the disease in the first place. They were exposed because policymakers failed to stop the spread.*"

Here‚Äôs an example of being over-cautious:

Full martial law imposed, all citizens except military confined to their homes 24/7 for the next 12 months. Anyone caught outside their home to be shot on sight to prevent infection.

That would stop the virus from spreading , but the knock on effects on the economy would be utterly catastrophic.

Likewise being over cautious about the economy (allowing everybody to just carry on as they are to try and protect jobs) is equally dumb.  Getting the balance right is what‚Äôs important (and incredibly difficult)

People will die from coronavirus. It‚Äôs inevitable. It‚Äôs just a question of how many and when.
But if the economy tanks people will also die, whether directly or indirectly from the effects."

If the scales tip too far one way, something will have to give. You could argue humans have gamed this concept for a long time (e.g. technology, civilisation etc.) but any runaway population increase will have increased pressures (e.g. disease, food supply, niche availability). 

Coronavirus is just a *relatively* mild example (compared to say the black plague of medieval Europe) of increased disease pressure, which would normally 'help' to balance that population from climbing out of control. So, though I wouldn't antropomorphise the concept into the earth defending itself, it does sort of make sense from a layman's perspective?"

The bigger issue though is that why isnt the Left trying to capitalize on this epidemic?  The Right *never* misses an opportunity to spin a tragedy to their benefit.  Even when their policies are at fault - like all these mass shootings we have - they are still able to double down and twist the facts into making people believe *more* guns are good.

So why the fuck can't the Left use this Coronavirus issue to show people that the government isn't as evil as they've been told it is?  Why can't the Left show folks that having mandatory sick time is both a liberal idea and vital to keeping people, and an entire nation, feeling well?  Why isn't the Left making a big stink about medical costs related to this illness and how Medicare 4 All would solve these kinds of problems?  I see posts on Reddit about it, but Reddit isn't real life.  Average Joes on the street aren't talking about how Medicare 4 All would help them,  but next mass shooting, I guarantee you I'll hear some other moron parrot NRA talking points on how being well armed would protect them in an emergency.

Also religious services were amongst the first things to be suspended. It's now possible to attend them I think but only if the Church can guarantee the safety measures. It's not ideal but the Pope has been low-key a dick about this so this has been our compromise.

I think beyond average population age there are other factors to consider: numbers of people tested, density of population, people being respectful of self-quarantine rules once they suspect an infection (this latter one was a MASSIVE problem for Italy at the start), and the way the numbers are presented.

Italy is reporting all people who test positive for coronavirus as ""coronavirus-related death"" even when the infected person was an hospital resident with several previous health problem who died of some other comorbidity. Another factor to consider is that Italy has waived testing of suspected cases, focusing the testing only on people whose cases are acute enough to require hospitalisation. This is is probably why the death rate in Italy is so high, as only the worst cases get acknowledged in the daily ""newly infected"" tally."

This just mean you don't get what the WHO and a Pandemic are. Being categorized as a pandemic was always on the horizon, basically since the very start

> To me it‚Äôs just flu‚Äôs sibling.

To people who know what they are talking about, it's a different strain. Influenzavirus and coronaviruses aren't the same thing. Furthermore, Covid-2019 is a new strain, that's why it's called that way, because it got discovered in 2019

> The mode of transmission is the same

Because they are both viruses...

> the symptoms are the same and the recovery phase is the same.

They are not. You just don't know what you're talking about.

> The panic however is a self-sustaining cycle.

Not really... 

> Yes coronavirus is contagious but so is flu.

It's pretty funny you thought you said a smart thing there, but it just shows your lack of research

> What happens if someone in the office or college gets flu? They stay home and the rest work or study. I find the closing down of institutions quite extra. Also borders closing down, c‚Äômon. 

Oh my, could it be the mortality rate is quite a lot higher and that we have no solution as of yet ?

> Imagine what that does to the global economy. It‚Äôs a recession that we are knowingly getting ourselves into.

The recession isn't caused by the Coronavirus"

TOKYO ‚Äî The official Tokyo 2020 Olympics and Paralympics Games Twitter account offers no inkling that the novel coronavirus pandemic has threatened the Games - and the account's cheery tone is prompting sarcastic online replies.

Japanese officials insist the Olympics will go on as planned, and the Tokyo 2020 tweets reflect this.

Italy is under a total lockdown amid more than 12,000 infections, but a post showcases the Games' official mascots, Miraitowa and Someity, conducting a jaunty video tour of Europe. The day Japan ordered schools closed for weeks, the account tweeted rhapsodic praises of spring flowers.

Early in March, as the mascots danced in front of Barcelona's Sagrada Familia, ""NatsuOtaku"" wrote: ""Are they going from country to country announcing a postponement?""

Andrew Zimbalist, an economist at Smith College specializing in sports economics, said the planning committee's Twitter game fell short for two big reasons.

""First, the IOC and the Tokyo organizing committee are in denial. They have never had to cancel an Olympics for anything but a world war,"" he said.

""Second, they want to control the spin. By pretending that there will be business as usual, they are hoping to keep Olympians in training and Olympic fans in preparation for traveling to Tokyo. If by some good fortune the virus abates and the Olympics are held, they want to make sure the athletes are present and prepared.""

 ""This is the very first antibody that we know blocks the infection and there is a good chance that it will also become a drug that will come onto the market,"" says Rotterdam professor of cell biology Frank Grosveld in the university magazine.

 The researchers still had the antibody in the laboratory after previous research into similar virus infections.  ""We have to do something and maybe we have something,"" they thought according to Grosveld.  ""That's why we started immediately and worked around the clock.""

 Not yet published

 There are a number of caveats to make.  The antibody has yet to be tested on humans, which takes months.  The research has also not yet been assessed by colleagues.  That is happening right now.  If they approve, it is expected to be published.  Now it is already online on a site where biologists share their research.

 Research leader Berend-Jan Bosch (Utrecht University) does not want to raise false expectations.  ""It is a first promising step, but it is still too early to speculate about the potential efficacy in humans,"" he said in a response to the NOS.  ""The study is being reviewed by a leading scientific journal. Further comments may be provided once the article has been accepted.

 ""
 A real solution is a vaccine.

 Frank Grosveld, professor of cell biology
 Grosveld explains that the antibody prevents the virus from being able to infect.  It can be used to develop a drug against this corona infection (COVID-19).

 The researchers are trying to get a pharmaceutical company to produce the medicine on a large scale.  ""If you take this as a patient, it is expected that the infection can be stopped in the patient. So the patient will have the chance to recover.""

 ""Prevention is of course better than cure,"" says Grosveld.  ""A real solution is therefore a vaccine, others are working on that. However, developing a vaccine takes two years"

Second of all, she's contradicting herself, as she said the 'virus isn't in the air, it's probably on your hands', then later said it can enter your body through air.

Lastly, she didn't say don't wear masks, she said it's not necessary as long as you're not in close contact with people who are coughing or sneezing. Explain to me how you can stop yourself from being in close contact with someone who's coughing or sneezing when your'e dealing with thousands of people at an AMC?

Actually, explain to me how you can avoid being in contact with people coughing or sneezing when you're in the subway, and someone next to you suddenly sneezes? 

[Also, maybe you should tell the CDC they're wrong](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prepare/transmission.html) when they said the disease spreads through droplets and coughing.

Again, let's have a little common sense, one easy way to catch it is if someone sneezes near you. If you are in contact with a bunch of people, you can't control if someone will sneeze. Therefore, you can only do what you can to protect youself.

Not hard to understand."

That is - does this patient have coronavirus. It is an important piece of data for a doctor making a treatment decision. 

On your final point, it is futile to compare incomparable numbers. Without consistent testing approaches between countries, comparing their numbers and drawing conclusions is not possible. Also, others have mentioned here, looking at number of deaths is also not helpful without robust testing. Something like 3,700 people die in Japan per day and many of these are above the age of 70. Although you can point to one case of posthumous testing, I think you are also confident that it is not routinely (or even regularly) carried out. It would take just one of those 3,700 deaths per day to be chalked up to an elderly person dying from pneumonia or other health complications they have to put that number at over 60 (assuming deaths started at the beginning of February). In the case of two of those 3,700, it would be 100. I am aware that the television programs are making this argument as a source of pride in the numbers, however without robust testing, the number is close meaningless. 

Look, I agree with your core point that we are in the stage where we should be prioritizing not overwhelming hospitals. I just think some of your logic regarding non-testing as the best way of doing this is flawed, and your way of explaining comes across as condescending and argumentative."

You are the first one I spoke in the last few weeks who actually can provide additional informations, but I have several problems with the link.

First: I compare it to the flu, not because the two illnesses are 100% similar, but because everybody knows the flu and still don't care. It think that is what most people mean. The whole article compares the two and point out the biggest problem: They can be spread before symptoms showing. My comparison should only show that we should treat Corona exactly like a flu outbreak. Not because the symptoms are similar, but because the flu is more dangerous and the steps we take are in 9/10 cases enough to don't have something like 2017/2018

Second: ""The coronavirus is about 5%""
That's not what the article says and not how the numbers fit together. The article talks about max 3,X% and the article itself says that the number is most likely due to incomplete data and more like 2%

But since the coronavirus seems to be waaay less infectious, it's still better than the flu. More people get ill and die trough the flu.

Third: There are 4 strains of coronavirus before ""SARS-CoV-2"" which let to the now know outbreak. Quote: 'The four other coronavirus strains that already exist are responsible for around 25% of our common colds, Adalja added.'

Fourth: That there is no vaccine is bad for the elderly, but everybody else should be fine since I don't know anybody under 65 who gets a flu shot, because when you're young is just not necessary. But that there is no vaccine doesn't mean we have no ways to treat the virus. Paracetamol, so the most basic medicine I know, is one great thing against the coronavirus, because it's against fever (the most dangerous and lethal symptom) and pain.

Fifth: We can't stop that the coronavirus does get ""added to the list of illnesses"" thats over since the first 100 people where infected (most likely before).

Sixth: Quote: Because there‚Äôs no proven therapy or vaccine. This is right and wrong. We don't have a vaccine, but we have therapy and medication."

&#x200B;

The new Coronavirus may not show sign of infection for many days. How can one know if he/she is infected? By the time they have fever and/or cough and go to the hospital, the lung is usually 50% Fibrosis and it's too late. Taiwan experts provide a simple self-check that we can do every morning. Take a deep breath and hold your breath for more than 10 seconds. If you complete it successfully without coughing, without discomfort, stiffness or tightness, etc., it proves there is no Fibrosis in the lungs, basically indicates no infection.

&#x200B;

In critical time, please self-check every morning in an environment with clean air. Serious excellent advice by Japanese doctors treating COVID-19 cases: Everyone should ensure your mouth & throat are moist, never dry. Take a few sips of water every 15 minutes at least. Why? Even if the virus gets into your mouth, drinking water or other liquids will wash them down through your throat and into the stomach. Once there, your stomach acid will kill all the virus. If you don't drink enough water more regularly, the virus can enter your windpipe and into the lungs. That's very dangerous.

&#x200B;

Please send and share this with family and friends. Take care everyone and may the world recover from this Coronavirus soon.

&#x200B;

IMPORTANT ANNOUNCEMENT - CORONAVIRUS

&#x200B;

1. If you have a runny nose and sputum, you have a common cold

2. Coronavirus pneumonia is a dry cough with no runny nose.

3. This new virus is not heat-resistant and will be killed by a temperature of just 26/27 degrees. It hates the Sun.

4. If someone sneezes with it, it takes about 10 feet before it drops to the ground and is no longer airborne.

5. If it drops on a metal surface it will live for at least 12 hours - so if you come into contact with any metal surface - wash your hands as soon as you can with a bacterial soap.

6. On fabric it can survive for 6-12 hours. normal laundry detergent will kill it.

7. Drinking warm water is effective for all viruses. Try not to drink liquids with ice.

8. Wash your hands frequently as the virus can only live on your hands for 5-10 minutes, but - a lot can happen during that time - you can rub your eyes, pick your nose unwittingly and so on.

9. You should also gargle as a prevention. A simple solution of salt in warm water will suffice.

10. Can't emphasis enough - drink plenty of water!

&#x200B;

THE SYMPTOMS

1. It will first infect the throat, so you'll have a sore throat lasting 3/4 days

2. The virus then blends into a nasal fluid that enters the trachea and then the lungs, causing pneumonia. This takes about 5/6 days further.

3. With the pneumonia comes high fever and difficulty in breathing.

4. The nasal congestion is not like the normal kind You feel like you're drowning. It's imperative you then seek immediate attention.

But rather than parrot the lines of the government it is possible to listen to the high number of scientific experts who are questioning the uk strategy. Like Martin Hibberd, professor of emerging infectious disease at the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine, who said: 


‚Äú making plans that assume such a large proportion of the population will become infected (and hopefully recovered and immune) may not be the very best that we can do ... 

‚ÄúAnother strategy might be to try to contain [it] longer and perhaps long enough for a therapy to emerge that might allow some kind of treatment. This seems to be the strategy of countries such as Singapore.‚Äú 

Or Anthony Costello, a paediatrician and former World Health Organization director, who said that the UK government was out of kilter with other countries in looking to herd immunity as the answer. It could conflict with WHO policy, he said in a series of Twitter posts, which is to contain the virus by tracking and tracing all cases. He quoted Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the WHO director general, who said: ‚ÄúThe idea that countries should shift from containment to mitigation is wrong and dangerous.‚Äù

Herd immunity might not even last, Costello said. ‚ÄúDoes coronavirus cause strong herd immunity or is it like flu where new strains emerge each year needing repeat vaccines? We have much to learn about Co-V immune responses.‚Äù Vaccines, he said, were a much safer way of bringing it about.


This is just the torygraph doing its best to deflect criticism from the government - despite years of trying to make everyone in the uk an armchair expert on things like international trade, tariffs, immigration and asylum rules and fisheries rights, and ignore any official expertise on these issues in favour of the things you can parrot from your favourite propaganda rag."

If he had not of cut taxes for Millionaires & Billionaires in 2017, we would be better positioned to deal with this crisis. But since Trump‚Äôs tax cuts already left the government under funded, and he‚Äôs had to increase domestic spending to reduce the damages inflicted by his idiotic Trade War Tariffs, we already have $Trillion Deficits.

These additional efforts to mitigate his botched response to the global pandemic will further increase our National Debt. At some point, $22,000,000,000,000 ($22Trillion) becomes a real problem.

There are legitimate reasons to run short term deficits. Funding programs that help poor, elderly, & disabled Americans pay other Americans for the things they need is always good for the economy.

Temporary tax cuts for the Middle Class during an economic crisis can be useful. But tax cuts for the Rich during times of economic growth just leaves our government unprepared for ‚Äúunavoidable‚Äù situations, like a global pandemic.

This is the kind of short term, greedy thinking that the GOP constantly bungles us into:

(This could go all the way back to the negative long term effects of Reagan‚Äôs Tinkle Down/Voodoo Economics in the 1980s, but for now I‚Äôll start with the past 20 years)

GWBush inherited a strong economy + a budget Surplus from Bill Clinton in 2001. But then Dubya -ignored genuine intel warnings of 9/11 + -cut taxes (at least then it was for everyone, but still primarily for the Rich) + -got us into an additional foreign war of conquest (based on false intel) in Iraq + -conducted reckless oversight of financial deregulation = -2008 economic collapse + ->$1,000,000,000,000 Deficits

After taking office in 2009, Obama managed to bring the economy back from the brink of a 2nd Great Depression + save millions of jobs + create millions of jobs + instituted consumer protections & new financial regulations + Patient Protections for Preexisting Conditions = the strong economy with 2% to 3% growth + Deficits reduced by 2/3rds that Trump inherited in 2017.

Trump then -cut taxes for Millionaires & Billionaires + -implemented idiotic Tariffs as part of his short sighted Trade Wars + -undermined long term economic, & military alliances + -rolled back consumer protections & financial regulations + -ignored warnings of a global pandemic + -attempts to undermine Patient Protections for Preexisting Conditions + -sabotage safety net programs, like Medicaid, & SNAP (Food Stamps) = -an economy teetering on collapse + ->$1,000,000,000,000 Deficits.

TL;DR: Republicans are terrible for the economy, and are responsible for huge Deficits + global instability + social unrest, & poor public health."

The trial needs to report its results by September. At that point there'll be very comprehensive data on the safety (every recorded safety issue will be reported, however minor) and the number of deaths in each trial arm (that's the ""primary outcome"" of the trial). Plus various other things -- the ""clinical study report"" for a phase 3 trial can be 20,000 pages long!

Of course, if the drug is very dangerous and causes a lot of safety issues, but reduces Ebola-related deaths, then it's likely to be approved for Ebola. However, the risk-benefit calculation might be very different for coronavirus, where mortality is much lower. You wouldn't want to take a drug which kills 10% of people but reduces viral effects for coronavirus, but you probably would for Ebola, which kills most people it infects.

In my opinion (no evidence yet) remdesivir is unlikely to have serious safety issues. This is because its mechanism of action targets viral replication in a similar way to effective HIV drugs which people have taken for years. But we really have to test it properly first, because the risk of not testing is massive."

[Source](https://mobile.twitter.com/iandonald_psych/status/1238518371651649538?s=19)

1. The govt strategy on #Coronavirus is more refined than those used in other countries and potentially very effective. But it is also riskier and based on a number of assumptions. They need to be correct, and the measures they introduce need to work when they are supposed to.
2. This all assumes I'm correct in what I think the govt are doing and why. I could be wrong - and wouldn't be surprised. But it looks to me like. . .
3. A UK starting assumption is that a high number of the population will inevitably get infected whatever is done ‚Äì up to 80%. As you can‚Äôt stop it, so it is best to manage it.

There are limited health resources so the aim is to manage the flow of the seriously ill to these.
4. The Italian model the aims to stop infection. The UKs wants infection BUT of particular categories of people. The aim of the UK is to have as many lower risk people infected as possible. Immune people cannot infect others; the more there are the lower the risk of infection
5. That's herd immunity.
Based on this idea, at the moment the govt wants people to get infected, up until hospitals begin to reach capacity. At that they want to reduce, but not stop infection rate. Ideally they balance it so the numbers entering hospital = the number leaving.
6. That balance is the big risk.

All the time people are being treated, other mildly ill people are recovering and the population grows a higher percent of immune people who can‚Äôt infect. They can also return to work and keep things going normally - and go to the pubs.
7.The risk is being able to accurately manage infection flow relative to health case resources. Data on infection rates needs to be accurate, the measures they introduce need to work and at the time they want them to and to the degree they want, or the system is overwhelmed.
8. Schools: Kids generally won‚Äôt get very ill, so the govt can use them as a tool to infect others when you want to increase infection. When you need to slow infection, that tap can be turned off ‚Äì at that point they close the schools. Politically risky for them to say this.
9. The same for large scale events - stop them when you want to slow infection rates; turn another tap off. This means schools etc are closed for a shorter period and disruption generally is therefore for a shorter period, AND with a growing immune population. This is sustainable
10. After a while most of the population is immune, the seriously ill have all received treatment and the country is resistant. The more vulnerable are then less at risk. This is the end state the govt is aiming for and could achieve.
11. BUT a key issue during this process is protection of those for whom the virus is fatal. It's not clear the full measures there are to protect those people. It assumes they can measure infection, that their behavioural expectations are met - people do what they think they will
12. The Italian (and others) strategy is to stop as much infection as possible - or all infection. This is appealing, but then what? The restrictions are not sustainable for months. So the will need to be relaxed. But that will lead to reemergence of infections.
13. Then rates will then start to climb again. So they will have to reintroduce the restrictions each time infection rates rise. That is not a sustainable model and takes much longer to achieve the goal of a largely immune population with low risk of infection of the vulnerable
14. As the government tries to achieve equilibrium between hospitalisations and infections, more interventions will appear. It's perhaps why there are at the moment few public information films on staying at home. They are treading a tight path, but possibly a sensible one.
15. This is probably the best strategy, but they should explain it more clearly. It relies on a lot of assumptions, so it would be good to know what they are - especially behavioural. Most encouraging, it's way too clever for #BorisJohnson to have had any role in developing."

We live in some very uncertain and strange times

Proof of this comes in the form of this global mass hysteria, panic buying/hoarding of toilet paper

It has become such an issue, people are now fist fighting in the store‚Ä¶ Brawling up and down the worlds toilet paper isles. Similar to Black Friday‚Ä¶  (The day after Thanksgiving in the United States‚Ä¶ Technically kicks off holiday shopping season‚Ä¶ Stores, especially places like Walmart will have huge discounts on things and people will literally line up around the block several times over just to get a chance at scoring one of these big deals. Look it up on YouTube‚Ä¶ It is absolutely the most bizarre thing. One minute you‚Äôre sitting around a table and enjoying the company of friends and family and being thankful‚Ä¶ Then, in some cases several hours later‚Ä¶ Some stores have given up waiting for a particular time on Friday and they get a Headstart on Black Friday by opening it late Thanksgiving evening

You might find yourself being stampeded or thrown to the ground with a boot to the head so you will relinquish the very last discounted piece of electronica garbage that is the must-have for the season

This toilet paper thing is like that‚Ä¶ Except without the musical accompaniment of jingle bells every place you go

This mass hysteria and people hoarding ridiculous and irresponsibly large amount of toilet paper so that there is none left‚Ä¶ Too bad‚Ä¶ If granny isn‚Äôt there at the moment the toilet paper is delivered‚Ä¶ No sooner is it set out then it‚Äôs all grabbed up‚Ä¶ Granny being kicked out of the way huddling in a heap on the floor as some crazy moron snatches the last packet of horrible discount, will absolutely cut your ass off with all if it‚Äôs scratchy roughness bottom of the wrong toilet paper


If this particular coronavirus caused intestinal issues‚Ä¶ This toilet paper hoarding, while still off the chain, would be perfectly understandable‚Ä¶ This virus does not give you intestinal issues it causes breathing difficulties unless you want to count any panic induced diarrhea over the whole thing


So why? What is it with this toilet paper? Well‚Ä¶ I suspect there must be some sort of militant underground group of Apocalypse preppers and survivalists that are watching things disintegrate‚Ä¶ They are counting on civilization to fall apart to such an extent where traditional currency is worthless‚Ä¶ Might as well use it to wipe your rear end‚Ä¶ And toilet paper‚Ä¶ Well‚Ä¶

I have read first-hand accounts from people who have spent time in prison‚Ä¶ There is an underground economy there‚Ä¶ Prisoners do not make a lot of money obviously‚Ä¶ So alternative currency must be invented

Half a stick of beef jerky, complete with teeth marks and random bits of lint, a book of stamps, a partially used up phone card and several packets of top Ramen. This might be worthless on the outside‚Ä¶ But on the other side of the bars‚Ä¶ You are rolling like Donald Trump like Mac Miller talked about in that Donald Trump song‚Ä¶


Toilet paper‚Ä¶ That‚Äôs what the new economy will be based on‚Ä¶ Forget about bitcoin it‚Äôs all about the buttcoin  baby!

Just as there are different amounts of currency represented by various coins and paper money‚Ä¶ This sort of toilet paper one is fortunate enough to have will be more or less valuable depending on what it is

Your bargain basement half ply toilet paper that is so rough it comes with a teeny tiny little acts so you can chop off whatever you need. That would be equivalent to pennies let‚Äôs say

They have all kinds of options for toilet paper‚Ä¶ Some have flowers printed on them to come in a variety of colors so you can perfectly match the decor of your bathroom or Porta potty or hole in the ground. Some have a smell to them‚Ä¶. Unfortunately most of the time it seems as if that smell is the radioactive aftermath of consuming Taco Bell‚Ä¶ Unsuccessfully masked by an under running current of old lady smell or church bathroom smell. I am sure you could get toilet paper adorned with roses and smelling like a flower garden even if your rear end it does not

This might speak to a fundamental lacking of something important in my life but‚Ä¶ The subset of toilet paper that fascinates me is the one where you can have somebody‚Äôs face printed on

Donald Trump for example‚Ä¶ There is toilet paper that you can purchase that has Donald Trump and he‚Äôs weird hair, glowering at you, eyes narrowed, lips pursed in a grim line indicating he doesn‚Äôt take crap off of anyone‚Ä¶ Except for well I guess since it‚Äôs on toilet paper he does‚Ä¶ But he tries to project a sensitive he means business. Let me just pause on what the F is wrong with you Avenue to say‚Ä¶ If you want to step up your political bathroom decor‚Ä¶ You can get a toilet paper roll bar, that bar that goes through the toilet paper to hold it on to the toilet paper holder that has Donald Trump recording various words so you could have a chat with him as you wipe off the excess is a Taco Bell or more fitting KFC‚Ä¶

I am guessing toilet paper such as that would be very very sought after and therefore very very powerful in this brave new world‚Ä¶



TLDR Forget about bitcoin it‚Äôs all about the buttcoin wants everything goes all lord of the flies"

Obama had it all setup for Trump to contain or defuse a pandemic. But Trump had to fuck with the safety nets that Obama had setup.

First, [Trump cut the global health security unit, whose role was to oversee global pandemics:](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/trump-struggles-explain-why-he-disbanded-his-global-health-team-n1153221) 

> It was two years ago when Trump ordered the shutdown of the White House National Security Council's entire global health security unit. NBC News had a good report on this recently, noting that the president's decision ""to downsize the White House national security staff -- and eliminate jobs addressing global pandemics -- is likely to hamper the U.S. government's response to the coronavirus.""

Then:

The funding support, which went to training local health professionals and bolstering emergency response across 49 countries, was reduced to just 10 nations.

That is referring to the total number of deaths THAT week being due to influenza and pneumonia (coincidentally pneumonia is NOT in fact influenza. Coronavirus also often kills people with pneumonia). The flu has a LOW mortality rate as the literal website that you just [linked me shows.](https://www.cdc.gov/flu/about/burden/index.html) It says that there are between 9.3 and 45 million cases of flu per year in the US and 12,000 to 16,000 deaths.

The worst part of this is that you honestly believed that the common flu had a mortality rate of 7 fucking percent. And now I am positive that you are just going to brush it off, as if that doesn't completely show you have no idea what you are talking about.

Honestly you can't really think these are good arguments, right? COVID has infected a total of 100,000 people in the world, the flu infects 45 million in the US ALONE per year. COVID hasn't reached those numbers because it literally started spreading 2 months ago.

> I see you are a fearmonger. Numbers and stats show you have a higher chance of both getting infected and dying from this year's strain of flu.

If by numbers and stats you mean taking the previous years numbers, extrapolating them to the rest of this year, and pretending that coronavirus will not continue to grow. Do you honestly think that Italy shut down every business in the country, blocked all entry and exit, and is prosecuting people for breaking their quarantine because it's just the common flu? Do you think the PM of Italy just decided it would be fun to tank their economy for no reason? Do you think the PHD's advising every country on their policy during this disaster know less about the risks involved in this disease than you do? Do you find it odd that 99.9% of doctors and global health professionals are extremely worried about the spread of this and the amount of damage and deaths it could cause?

The argument that people will freak out over FDIC insurance but will calm down once they learn about the Fed stabilizing the repo market is, in my view, a difficult one to make.

The volatility in the repo market pre-dated the coronavirus crisis. It can be analyzed without recourse to ""people freaking out and lining up for their money at the bank like buying toilet paper."" The Fed's action has complex effects, one of which is to stabilize asset prices, including the stock market. It does not provide social insurance in the vein of UBI or other support.

Now could that change with mutations of the mild form of the coronavirus? Yes but hopefully it will not."

Die chinesische Regierung wirft aktuell den Amerikanern vor, dass die CIA den Virus in Wuhan ""ausgesetzt"" haben. Aus Indien wurde ganz zum Anfang der Coronavirus-Epidemie eine wissenschaftliche Untersuchung ver√∂ffentlicht, wonach sich im coronavirusgenom Teile des HIV-Genoms befinden und zwar genau in den Proteinen, in denen das ""Andocken"" des Virus an menschliche Zellen erm√∂glicht wird. Dadurch wird die Infekti√∂sit√§t erh√∂ht.

[https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.01.30.927871v1](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.01.30.927871v1)

Sofort wurden das microbiologische Labor in Wuhan und  ihr Leiter angeschuldigt, zumal letzterer im Bereich der Flederm√§use-Biologie arbeitet. F√ºr die Chinesen wird es leicht gewesen sein, beide Vermutungen zu belegen oder zu widerlegen. tats√§chlich hat sich China bisher dazu nicht ge√§u√üert.

Es gibt nun drei M√∂glichkeiten:

1. Der Virus ist genetisch nicht ver√§ndert.
2. Der Virus ist genetisch ver√§ndert und stammt aus dem Labor in Wuhan (irrt√ºmliche Freisetzung; Betriebsunfall)
3. Der Virus ist genetisch ver√§ndert und stammt nicht aus dem Labor in Wuhan (ggf. absichtliche Freisetzung)

Der letzte Fall w√§re eine Kriegserkl√§rung. Das w√ºrde dann auch erkl√§ren, wenn Russland und ggf. China (die TIC-Data werden wir erst sp√§ter sehen), der US-amerikanischen (Finanz-)Wirtschaft den Stecker zieht und gleichzeitig medienwirksam Italien (und S√ºd-Korea) mit ""dutzenden Beatmungsger√§ten"" und Schutzmaterial beliefert."

People with higher risk and with family older family members may not go out at all for a month...or longer. Fatality rates for older people are high.  I‚Äôll go out but into nature...not places where people congregate and leave infected mucus all over the place.

It would also explain the following two points:

* ""[Flattening the curve](https://www.wired.com/story/whats-social-distancing-flattening-curve-covid-19-questions/)"" started being stated as a way to prevent the initial influx of covid-19 cases into hospital. This would suggest staggering out the infection over a longer period of time is better.
* We also started hearing that the federal government expects [30% - 70%](https://www.ctvnews.ca/health/coronavirus/covid-19-could-infect-30-to-70-per-cent-of-canadians-health-minister-1.4850181) of Canadian residents will contract the virus.

2020-03-14,pinkpix,Netherlands,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Netherlands/comments/figxpr/wetenschappers_rotterdam_en_utrecht_claimen/fkh21tq/,"**Wetenschappers Rotterdam en Utrecht claimen vondst antilichaam tegen corona**

Wetenschappers van het Erasmus Medisch Centrum en de Universiteit Utrecht zeggen dat ze een antilichaam hebben gevonden tegen de ziekte die wordt veroorzaakt door het coronavirus, meldt Erasmus Magazine.

""Dit is het allereerste antilichaam waarvan we weten dat het de infectie blokkeert en er is een goede kans dat dit ook een medicijn wordt dat op de markt komt"", zegt de Rotterdamse hoogleraar celbiologie Frank Grosveld in het universiteitsblad.

De onderzoekers hadden het antilichaam nog in het laboratorium staan na eerder onderzoek naar vergelijkbare virusinfecties. ""We moeten iets doen en misschien hebben we wat"", dachten ze volgens Grosveld. ""Daarom zijn we onmiddellijk aan de gang gegaan en hebben we de klok rond gewerkt.""

Nog niet gepubliceerd

Er is een aantal kanttekeningen te maken. Het antilichaam moet nog op mensen worden getest, wat maanden duurt. Ook is het onderzoek nog niet beoordeeld door vakgenoten. Dat gebeurt op dit moment. Als die het goedkeuren, dan wordt het naar verwachting gepubliceerd. Nu staat het al online op een site waar biologen hun onderzoek delen.

Onderzoeksleider Berend-Jan Bosch (Universiteit Utrecht) wil geen valse verwachtingen wekken. ""Het is een eerste belovende stap, maar het is nog te vroeg om te speculeren over de eventuele werkzaamheid in mensen"", zegt hij in een reactie aan de NOS. ""Het onderzoek ligt ter beoordeling bij een vooraanstaand wetenschappelijk tijdschrift. Verder commentaar kan gegeven worden zodra het artikel is geaccepteerd.

‚Äú
Een echte oplossing is een vaccin.

Frank Grosveld, hoogleraar celbiologie
Grosveld legt uit dat het antilichaam voorkomt dat het virus nog kan infecteren. Het kan worden gebruikt om een medicijn tegen deze corona-infectie (COVID-19) te ontwikkelen.

De onderzoekers proberen een farmaceutisch bedrijf zo ver te krijgen om het geneesmiddel op grote schaal te produceren. ""Als je dit als pati√´nt zou nemen dan is de verwachting dat de infectie in de pati√´nt gestopt kan worden. En de pati√´nt dus de kans krijgt om te herstellen.""

""Voorkomen is natuurlijk beter dan genezen"", zegt Grosveld. ""Een echte oplossing is daarom een vaccin, daar werken anderen aan. Een vaccin ontwikkelen duurt echter al gauw twee jaar."""

We had a week long module on the Great Depression and Hoove's anemic response, and I still retain some of that knowledge. 

COVID-19 has the potential to be a worldwide remembered event. It could easily be Trump's Legacy even moreso than even his impeachment.

2020-03-14,Tousdanslachariotte,effondrement,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/effondrement/comments/fihbwq/no√´l_mam√®re_le_coronavirus_nous_fait_vivre_une/fkh3tuy/,"**Tribune.** Qui aurait  imagin√© il y a seulement quinze jours que l‚ÄôItalie serait ¬´¬†boucl√©e¬†¬ª,  toute une population mise en quarantaine, pour cause de coronavirus¬†? Au  stade o√π nous en sommes, on ne peut s‚Äôemp√™cher de repenser au film *Contagion*,  de Steven Soderbergh (2011)¬†: une jeune femme, de retour de Hongkong,  meurt d‚Äôune infection inconnue. Son jeune fils, contamin√©, d√©c√®de  quelques heures plus tard.

C‚Äôest  le d√©but d‚Äôune √©pid√©mie √† l‚Äô√©chelle mondiale. Tandis que scientifiques  et m√©decins tentent de trouver un rem√®de, la panique se r√©pand plus vite  que le virus et les soci√©t√©s commencent √† se d√©sagr√©ger‚Ä¶ Comme en  Italie aujourd‚Äôhui, o√π m√©decins et autorit√©s ne savent plus comment  arr√™ter cette psychose et o√π le syst√®me de sant√© est au bord de  l‚Äôeffondrement. 

¬´¬†L‚Äôeffondrement¬†¬ª.  L‚Äôexpression est sur toutes les l√®vres des commentateurs et experts qui  d√©filent sur nos √©crans quand ils parlent du prix du p√©trole, de  l‚Äô√©conomie, du produit int√©rieur brut (PIB), des places boursi√®res, des  syst√®mes de sant√©‚Ä¶ Mais aucun n‚Äôose encore dire que nous sommes,  peut-√™tre, en train de vivre une sorte de r√©p√©tition g√©n√©rale avant  l‚Äôeffondrement majeur d‚Äôun mod√®le qui a trouv√© ses limites.

Car  il ne s‚Äôagit pas de la fin du monde, comme le pr√©tendent certains  marchands d‚Äôapocalypse complaisamment relay√©s par des m√©dias toujours  enclins √† la simplification - cela demande moins d‚Äôeffort que  l‚Äôexplicitation de la complexit√© ‚Äì mais de la fin d‚Äôun monde. Celui de  l‚Äôhyper-mondialisation, au niveau si √©lev√© d‚Äôinterd√©pendance des  infrastructures et des syst√®mes de production que des ¬´¬†perturbations¬†¬ª,  comme le coronavirus aujourd‚Äôhui ou des √©v√©nements in√©dits li√©s au  d√©r√®glement climatique, demain, pourraient lui √™tre fatals.

## L‚Äôinsupportable

Comme l‚Äô√©crivent Pablo Servigne et Rapha√´l Stivens dans *Comment tout peut s‚Äôeffondrer* (Le Seuil, 2015), nous faisons face √† un *¬´¬†nouveau  type de risque, le risque syst√©mique global, dont les d√©clencheurs  potentiels sont infinis, et qui peut rapidement entra√Æner aussi bien des  petites r√©cessions qu‚Äôune d√©pression √©conomique majeure ou un  effondrement g√©n√©ralis√©¬†¬ª*. Nous en sommes au stade de la d√©pression  √©conomique majeure, que plus personne ne nie aujourd‚Äôhui et dont les  plus pauvres vont √™tre les premi√®res victimes, acc√©l√©rant les in√©galit√©s  d‚Äôun monde o√π quelques milliers de milliardaires poss√®dent autant de  richesses que la moiti√© de l‚Äôhumanit√©.

Nous  pensions que cette mondialisation √©rig√©e en syst√®me o√π la  sp√©cialisation des t√¢ches est pouss√©e √† l‚Äôextr√™me garantissait la  domination de notre mode de vie. Cette mondialisation-l√† cachait  l‚Äôinsupportable, r√©v√©l√© notamment par l‚Äôaccident du Rana Plaza √† Dacca  (Bangladesh), qui, en¬†2013, a tu√© plus de mille ouvri√®res travaillant  dans des conditions indignes pour des marques de mode fran√ßaises et  autres afin de satisfaire notre d√©lire de consommation. M√™me si nous ne  voulons pas le croire, notre ¬´¬†syst√®me¬†¬ª est d‚Äôautant plus vuln√©rable et  fragile qu‚Äôil est global. Le d√©ni n‚Äòest pas une th√©rapie.

Le  coronavirus prouve s‚Äôil le fallait que nous sommes comme les pions d‚Äôun  jeu de dominos¬†: il suffit d‚Äôen faire tomber un pour que les autres  suivent. Comme l‚Äôa observ√© le sociologue allemand, Ulrich Beck, dans *La soci√©t√© du risque¬†: sur la voie d‚Äôune autre modernit√©* (Flammarion,  2008), livre pionnier publi√© en¬†1986, au lendemain de la catastrophe  nucl√©aire de Tchernobyl¬†: le risque est plus qu‚Äôune menace, il est  devenu la mesure de notre action.

A  la logique de la r√©partition des richesses a succ√©d√© une logique de la  r√©partition des risques. Et il n‚Äôest pas difficile de constater que nos  pays riches se sont ¬´¬†soulag√©s¬†¬ª de leurs risques sur les pays les plus  pauvres victimes de l‚Äôextractivisme, de la d√©forestation, du  d√©mant√®lement de nos √©quipements informatiques, des cultures OGM  massives. De m√™me, ils s‚Äôexon√®rent de leurs responsabilit√©s politiques  en sous-traitant aussi bien les ph√©nom√®nes migratoires ‚Äì ce qui les rend  complices de criminels de guerre tels qu‚ÄôAssad et Poutine ‚Äì, que la  gestion des multiples formes de pollution dont ils sont pourtant la  cause.

## Fragilit√© et d√©pendance

Il  aura fallu cette √©pid√©mie de coronavirus, apr√®s la crise financi√®re de  2008, pour remettre sur le m√©tier du monde la question de notre  fragilit√© et de notre d√©pendance, au reste de l‚Äôhumanit√© comme aux  ¬´¬†autres qu‚Äôhumains¬†¬ª, c‚Äôest-√†-dire au monde des vivants. Comme dans le  film *Contagion*, cette √©pid√©mie est partie d‚Äôun animal porteur  du virus. Plus nous porterons atteinte au monde sauvage, plus nous  d√©truirons son habitat et plus il se rapprochera de nous au risque de  nous transmettre ses virus qui sont pathog√®nes pour l‚Äôhomme.

En  fait, nous ne sommes qu‚Äôau d√©but de ¬´¬†perturbations¬†¬ª de ce type si  nous ne nous d√©cidons pas √† changer de mod√®le. Les r√©gimes autoritaires,  telle la Chine, en profiteront pour renforcer leurs syst√®mes de  surveillance num√©rique et faire la traque aux lanceurs d‚Äôalerte et  autres individus ne r√©pondant pas √† la norme sociale."

Movement - get out and go for a walk. It will help w/ the breathing, getting a wider perspective, and taking a screen break. Any movement, even if you‚Äôre on a treadmill watching the news, is still good for your brain. 

Mastery - do something you are good at and/or enjoy. Dust off old hobbies. Get engaged in a project. Feeling like you‚Äôre doing something, especially something you are good at, is very helpful. 

Talk w/ people.  Call, FaceTime, but have conversations. It helps to not be so stuck in your head or perseverating and going around in circles. Connect w/ a therapist.

People seem pleased with most of the ancestry, so fewer changes this time around. Although some of the breath weapon feats were fun, no ancestry has a 5 (!) feat chain, so I decided to trim the fat. I removed Controlled Breath and Breath Augmentation, and moved Rapid Breath to 13th level. This sets up a 3 feat chain for Dragonborn players interested in getting a cool breath weapon ability without hogging up all their ancestry feats. I know this might be a controversial decision, but this makes the ancestry less bloated and more focused, and therefore hopefully more polished. 

*Change Log*
* **Arcane Hide:** With Draconic Resilience no longer being a reaction, I moved its old ability up to Arcane Hide, but let it not cost a reaction since its higher level.   

* **Breath Augmentation:** A fun feat, but not essential to Dragon Breath, so I removed it. I want to minimize the number of breath weapon feats, so this had to go

* **Controlled Breath:** A fun feat, but somewhat niche, and most ancestries only have 2 feat chain, while Dragon Breath had 5 feats! Sadly Controlled Breath ended up on the cutting block

* **Draconic Resilience:** This previously mirrored a dwarven heritage power which is a bit strong for a 1st level feat, so I changed the ability to mirror Elven Verve instead. Its old power was moved up to Arcane Hide.

* **Rapid Breath:** Moved down to 13th level. The final part of the 3 feat chain for Dragon Breath. The damage starts to fall off compared to Elemental Heart dwarves, so this feat will help out the dragonborn in later levels.

That's it folks! Thank you to everyone that's helped along in this journey from v1 all the way to v7. I couldn't have done it without the community's feedback. If you have any constructive criticism, I would love to hear it. Otherwise, have a happy Saturday and stay safe from the Coronavirus!"

‚ÄúAnother strategy might be to try to contain [it] longer and perhaps long enough for a therapy to emerge that might allow some kind of treatment. This seems to be the strategy of countries such as Singapore. While this containment approach is clearly difficult (and may be impossible for many countries), it does seem a worthy goal; and those countries that can should aim to do.‚Äù


Anthony Costello, a paediatrician and former World Health Organization director, said that the UK government was out of kilter with other countries in looking to herd immunity as the answer. It could conflict with WHO policy, he said in a series of Twitter posts, which is to contain the virus by tracking and tracing all cases. He quoted Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the WHO director general, who said: ‚ÄúThe idea that countries should shift from containment to mitigation is wrong and dangerous.‚Äù

Herd immunity might not even last, Costello said. ‚ÄúDoes coronavirus cause strong herd immunity or is it like flu where new strains emerge each year needing repeat vaccines? We have much to learn about Co-V immune responses.‚Äù Vaccines, he said, were a much safer way of bringing it about.


The former regional director of Public Health England has issued a furious condemnation what he described as the UK government‚Äôs ‚Äúcomplacent‚Äù response to the coronavirus pandemic.

A visibly angry Professor John Ashton told BBC Newsnight the government should have started putting measures in place a month ago, and raised concerns hospitals would be overworked.


former health secretary Jeremy Hunt have expressed concern about the decision to delay more drastic measures, such as school closures. Hunt criticised the government for not going far enough and said the UK‚Äôs response made it an ‚Äúoutlier‚Äù when compared with other countries that have taken more robust measures."

REDWOOD CITY, Calif. ‚Äî  Amid the new coronavirus, the freeways of the Bay Area are less clogged than usual, and shelves of grocery stores look apocalyptically ransacked ‚Äî byproducts of California being part of an international pandemic.
It also comes with some advantages: If Bay Area residents belong to a certain healthcare plan, they can easily drive through the region‚Äôs unusually free-flowing roads to visit a drive-through test site for COVID-19.

They just open their mouth. Get tested. Then put the car in gear.

Two days later, they get their results.

On Friday, a drive-through coronavirus testing facility was set up in one of several outdoor parking lots owned by Kaiser Permanente in Redwood City. It represented a fragment of the aggressive drive-through testing that South Korea conducted to help stem COVID-19; but for California, it was a start.

Under a blue pop-up tent, a team that rotated between six and seven staff members waited for incoming automobile-steering patients.

At 4:20 on a blustery but sunny afternoon, a dark gray Toyota Prius, driven by a woman in sunglasses, rolled up to the cordoned-off parking lot, and was waved in by a uniformed security guard. She pulled gingerly up to the pop tent, rolled down her window and took off her shades.

Bustling into action, a nurse helped Rod Mokhtari, Kaiser‚Äôs Redwood City assistant chief of medicine, don himself with a yellow paper gown. The nurse then helped him swaddle his hands with a pair of purple latex gloves.

Properly adorned, with smock, gloves, a mask and protective glasses, Mokhtari stepped out from the tent, and approached the driver‚Äôs side window ‚Äî sampling kit in hand.

Patient and doctor exchanged a few words, before she tilted her head back slightly and opened her mouth wide. Mokhtari, cotton swab in hand, reached in and with small, circular motions, swabbed the inside of her mouth. Satisfied, he pulled the utensil out, and dropped it into a container.

He then grabbed a new one, and with her head still tilted back, he inserted it into her left nostril ‚Äî which caused her to blink a few times ‚Äî extruded it, and also dropped it into a container.

She then drove off. Start to finish: no more than 5 minutes.

Ten minutes later another patient arrived, and the process was repeated.

Mokhtari was not available for an interview. The name of the nurse was not provided. But the procedure provided a small glimpse of how South Korea, with its government-run healthcare system, could test so many people so fast.

As of this week, South Korea, a nation of 51 million, had tested about 250,000 people since Jan. 20, when the outbreak occurred there. In the United States, with a far higher population, less than 15,000 had been tested by Friday, according to published reports.

California‚Äôs lack of statewide testing, compounded by the federal government‚Äôs inability to procure key chemicals needed for the tests, is one reason Silicon Valley has become ground zero for the virus statewide. As of Friday, Santa Clara County had reported 79 confirmed cases, and surrounding counties had reported many more.

According to Marc Brown, director of national communications for Kaiser, the medical group has set up only three of these drive-up testing sites. One in San Francisco, another in San Leandro, and this one, here in Redwood City.

The facilities are not permanent and change from day-to-day.

He said no sites have yet been set up in Southern California, and had no information about plans to do so. However, he said other regional centers, such as those in Colorado and the Washington, D.C., will be trying them out as early as this weekend.

‚ÄúThese aren‚Äôt for the general public,‚Äù he said, noting that only patients who are Kaiser members and have been provided an appointment with the facility by their doctor are permitted access.

The sites are not publicly disclosed, he said, because the point of the procedure is to reduce the risk of exposure that occurs in hospital or clinic waiting rooms ‚Äî where several people can come into contact with one another and the virus can be transmitted. ‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt want crowds showing up.‚Äù

Drive-through testing is also being tried in New Rochelle, N.Y. ‚Äî where a large cluster of COVID 19 cases are located ‚Äî and Philadelphia. The number of people tested are low, but New York‚Äôs governor was optimistic Friday.

‚ÄúWe‚Äôre partnering with Northwell and BioReference to run the state‚Äôs first drive-through testing facility and ensure the highest-risk population gets the tests they need to help us contain and combat this pandemic,‚Äù Gov. Andrew Cuomo said."

What the fuck is that shit, and how is the President supposed to change something like that when chances are he isn't made aware of it until it becomes too late.

Haz una tabla, incluye en l√≠neas los paises: china, corea, singapur, Iran, Jap√≥n, eeuu, italia, Francia, Alemania, (yo meto tambi√©n Irlanda y Luxemburgo) y Espa√±a, claro.

Singapur es modelo. Iran es control de tercer mundo. Alemania es control de pa√≠ses europeos que hacen las cosas bien. Italia es control de pa√≠s europeo que hace las cosas mal.

Y ahora metes en columnas y siempre en tasas de x/por mill√≥n:

Mortalidad general actual (menos muertos por coronavirus, ahora no es importante, pero seg√∫n crecen los n√∫meros, lo es). Mortalidad general en la √∫ltima d√©cada. Infectados. Muertos por coronavirus (es decir +/+, + en tests y + en muerte). Tests (que es el dato clave).

Y ahora solo queda comparar.
Un caso f√°cil: Alemania no tiene diferencia significativa entre su tasa de mortalidad actual y la media. As√≠ que no mienten y no hay muertos no reportados. Seg√∫n pasen los d√≠as y crezcan los datos esto ser√° m√°s fiable.

Y por √∫ltimo estableces 4 categorias:
+/+, + en tests y + en muerte. La tenemos.
+/-, + en tests y - en muerte. La tenemos.
-/+, no se hacen tests pero muere (esta cifra es la dificil)
-/-, poblaci√≥n general, el resto. Aqu√≠ estar√≠an los afectados asintom√°ticos y que sobreviven sin tratamiento.

Y recuerda que esto s√≥lo sirve para valorar tasas de mortalidad. Las tasas de infecci√≥n son todav√≠a m√°s complicadas de calcular, y se tiene que extrapolar el % de positivos y negativos de los tests a poblaci√≥n potencial expuesta. Para lo cual necesitamos otro dato fiable. Algo as√≠ como una poblaci√≥n donde se les haga tests a todo el mundo. Lo m√°s cercano es Corea pero no es suficiente.

Perd√≥n si es una biblia, es que esta es una de las cosas que hago en mi trabajo.

**The Minister of Health reported last night that the number of Covid-19 rises to 11**

DALTON HERRERA
Santo Domingo, RD

Three Dominicans, two Venezuelans and one French are newly infected with COVID-19, bringing the number of cases with positive diagnoses to 11 in the Dominican Republic.

In an impromptu press conference and without questions at the headquarters of the Ministry of Public Health, the head Rafael S√°nchez C√°rdenas made the announcement after 10:00 at night, without offering further details, promising that today he would break down the cases before the country.

S√°nchez C√°rdenas also confirmed that the Haitian who died in Jiman√≠ when he was traveling by bus from Santo Domingo to Port-au-Prince, and who had an autopsy performed in the Azua province, tested negative for ‚Äúcoronavirus‚Äù.

Another citizen who died at the Moscoso Puello hospital, who was suspected of having COVID-19, also found the results negative, according to C√°rdenas.

The official explained that 37 new tests for ""coronavirus"" were immigrated yesterday afternoon in the laboratory, whose samples confirmed the six new cases.

**Earlier in National Palace**

Six hundred beds will be enabled at the end of this month of March intended for the isolation of patients who in the next 15 days can be diagnosed with COVID-19, the pandemic that keeps half the planet paralyzed.

During a press conference held in the Orlando Mart√≠nez Room of the National Palace, S√°nchez C√°rdenas also reported that the Ram√≥n de Lara Hospital of the Dominican Air Force will function fully for isolation rooms with 70 beds, plus an additional 15 that will be available today.

""At this time, in said hospital, 13 isolated patients are kept, the five positives we already know and 8 in follow-up. Equipment is also being acquired and strengthened for cases that can be complicated, ‚Äùsaid S√°nchez C√°rdenas.

In addition, the official referred to Dominican students in Spain, of whom there are 800 scholarship holders from the Ministry of Higher Education, Science and Technology (Mescyt), who will begin to return to the country starting today.

While the Minister of Education, Antonio Pe√±a Mirabal, announced the suspension of teaching on the 16th and 17th of this month in order to carry out a preventive national day of deep cleaning and disinfection in all educational centers in the country, both in the public sector as in private.

‚ÄúThis will allow us to ensure that the return to class on Wednesday, the 18th, is carried out in fully hygienic conditions after the holding of the municipal elections on Sunday.

**Balance**

The Dominican authorities reported that so far there are 119 trips in home follow-up and 18 hospitalized.

‚ÄúIn total, we have taken 70 samples, resulting in five positive ones for the‚Äú coronavirus ‚Äùthat had already been reported, 40 negative and 25 pending laboratory results.

**About Haiti case**

S√°nchez C√°rdenas said he did not know the reasons why the Haitian authorities keep 18 students in quarantine in the Tabarre commune, after taking a bus trip from Santo Domingo to Port-au-Prince.

According to the official, he was going to have a meeting with the Haitian Minister of Health, Marie Greta Roy Cl√©ment; however, in the early morning hours the activity was suspended, so it is unknown if these people had any symptoms of the ‚ÄúCoronavirus‚Äù.

**Ram√≥n de Lara Hospital**

The Military Hospital of the Dominican Air Force was founded on December 28, 1958, by General Order No. 105 (1958) of the Secretary of State of the Armed Forces, in principle with the name of ""Dr Miguel Brioso Bustillos"".

However, on February 9, 1962, the Executive Branch issued Decree 7222, whereby Aviation acquired the name of the Dominican Air Force (FAD) and the hospital was renamed ""Dr Ram√≥n de Lara"", a fervent opponent of the Trujillo."
2020-03-14,Landohh,politics,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/fi8wvi/no_trump_cant_legally_use_coronavirus_to_move_the/fkh5gqc/,"Over the past year I've thankfully gotten my wife to be more involved with the political happenings in this country. When everyone says ""who cares they are all corrupt. What can I do?"" You're right, there isn't much you can do on your own. But if enough people who can't do anything get up and get involved then eventually we CAN do something.

She was watching his conference yesterday and I said ""I can totally see him saying that having an election is dangerous because the virus and we are ordered to stay home so he stays in office."" And she said ""wow. Holy crap.""

Trump is a piece of shit. If you believe anything he says anymore you are truly lost, ignorant and lack any sense of empathy and common sense. 

Like yesterday on NPR they had a roundtable with a few pundits talking about his response and the one guy was clearly from a camp of ""he's not a politician he's still learning."". The fact that Trump has contradicted health officials over and over the past two weeks came up and they a bunch of clips where Trump said ""it will go away with the hear"" ""people are getting better by going to work"" and the classic clip from his rally when he said ""coronavirus is a democratic hoax.""

Shaprio asked this guy isn't this something a president should not do or somethjng to that affect this is literally his response (I'm paraphrasing because I can't remember it word for word).

""Knowing what we know now a week later, I cant see anyone defending those remarks. However I believe the president was coming from a place of skepticism. What I think he meant and was trying to say is we need to approach this with caution and figure out what it is and be smart about this."" And he went on.

What you think he meant? Trump says what he means. There is no underlying message or meaning to his remarks. He is both unintelligent and cognitively more incompetent everyday. The distance between the words we hear and the meaning of said words is the shallowest of ponds. When he says it's a democratic hoax, that's what he means. When he says there are good people on both sides that's exactly what he means. 

He's a moron. His decisions to be the GOPs puppet, do the tax breaks, flip the courts all across this country, and embed their far right ideals into the bedrock of our country are what he believes. He's has power. He has turned this country into an oligarchy authoritarian regime and he wants to keep it that way because if he wasn't president, he would be in jail. So he has to stay in power. If he doesn't, he's doomed. He knows that. 

TLDR: 
Trump is a piece of shit. If you believe anything he says anymore you are truly lost, ignorant and lack any sense of empathy and common sense."

Copie/colle pour les allergiques a twitter:


1. The govt strategy on #Coronavirus is more refined than those used in other countries and potentially very effective. But it is also riskier and based on a number of assumptions. They need to be correct, and the measures they introduce need to work when they are supposed to.
2. This all assumes I'm correct in what I think the govt are doing and why. I could be wrong - and wouldn't be surprised. But it looks to me like. . .
3. A UK starting assumption is that a high number of the population will inevitably get infected whatever is done ‚Äì up to 80%. As you can‚Äôt stop it, so it is best to manage it.
There are limited health resources so the aim is to manage the flow of the seriously ill to these.
4. The Italian model the aims to stop infection. The UKs wants infection BUT of particular categories of people. The aim of the UK is to have as many lower risk people infected as possible. Immune people cannot infect others; the more there are the lower the risk of infection
5. That's herd immunity.
Based on this idea, at the moment the govt wants people to get infected, up until hospitals begin to reach capacity. At that they want to reduce, but not stop infection rate. Ideally they balance it so the numbers entering hospital = the number leaving.
6. That balance is the big risk.
All the time people are being treated, other mildly ill people are recovering and the population grows a higher percent of immune people who can‚Äôt infect. They can also return to work and keep things going normally - and go to the pubs.
7.The risk is being able to accurately manage infection flow relative to health case resources. Data on infection rates needs to be accurate, the measures they introduce need to work and at the time they want them to and to the degree they want, or the system is overwhelmed.
8. Schools: Kids generally won‚Äôt get very ill, so the govt can use them as a tool to infect others when you want to increase infection. When you need to slow infection, that tap can be turned off ‚Äì at that point they close the schools. Politically risky for them to say this.
9. The same for large scale events - stop them when you want to slow infection rates; turn another tap off. This means schools etc are closed for a shorter period and disruption generally is therefore for a shorter period, AND with a growing immune population. This is sustainable
10. After a while most of the population is immune, the seriously ill have all received treatment and the country is resistant. The more vulnerable are then less at risk. This is the end state the govt is aiming for and could achieve.
11. BUT a key issue during this process is protection of those for whom the virus is fatal. It's not clear the full measures there are to protect those people. It assumes they can measure infection, that their behavioural expectations are met - people do what they think they will
12. The Italian (and others) strategy is to stop as much infection as possible - or all infection. This is appealing, but then what? The restrictions are not sustainable for months. So the will need to be relaxed. But that will lead to reemergence of infections.
13. Then rates will then start to climb again. So they will have to reintroduce the restrictions each time infection rates rise. That is not a sustainable model and takes much longer to achieve the goal of a largely immune population with low risk of infection of the vulnerable
14. As the government tries to achieve equilibrium between hospitalisations and infections, more interventions will appear. It's perhaps why there are at the moment few public information films on staying at home. They are treading a tight path, but possibly a sensible one.
15. This is probably the best strategy, but they should explain it more clearly. It relies on a lot of assumptions, so it would be good to know what they are - especially behavioural. Most encouraging, it's way too clever for #BorisJohnson to have had any role in developing."

Scientists Erasmus MC and UU claim finding antibody against COVID-19
UPDATE: Scientists at Erasmus MC and Utrecht University claim the discovery of an antibody against COVID-19. The scientific publication of the group of ten scientists is ready for review by the leading journal Nature, reports Erasmus Magazine, which calls the discovery a world first.

The antibody prevents the virus from infecting and can also help in the detection of the virus,"" says Professor of Cell Biology Frank Grosveld, one of the discoverers on behalf of Erasmus MC.  

The article with the scientists' findings was published on Thursday evening on a website called BioRxiv, on which biologists can publish their research and to which colleagues can respond. The summary talks about an antibody against SARS2, the coronavirus that causes the current pandemic with COVID-19. The antibody was developed in the past against MERS, SARS and another coronavirus from Hong Kong (OC-43). From the earlier research we had untested antibodies that did not react with all three mutations, but with SARS1. When the current crisis - SARS2 - broke out, we immediately tested whether the antibodies that reacted with SARS1 also reacted to SARS2 and found the now published antibody,"" says Grosveld.

The antibody can help to detect and prevent this form of corona infection. Grosveld says the antibody can also be used to set up a diagnostic test in addition to developing the drug. ""One that anyone can just do at home so people can easily know if they have an infection or not.""  

Tests
According to Erasmus Magazine, the antibody has yet to be tested on humans, a process that takes months. Furthermore, the researchers are now trying to snare a pharmacist ('that looks good by the way') to take up the production of the antibody as a medicine.

On the seventeenth floor of Erasmus MC a corona vaccine has been being developed for years. This should protect us against the new virus, which may return every winter season. The virologists have plunged into a worldwide rat race for a vaccine against the coronavirus. Virologist Bart Haagmans of Erasmus knows that he probably won't be the fastest - his research group has ten men, pharmacists like Johnson & Johnson easily deploy tenfold manpower - but hopes that his group is the smartest.

The invention of the antibody now is important for making a medicine, says Grosveld. ""If you were to take this as a patient, the expectation - and that's just another expectation - is that the infection can be stopped in the patient."" According to him, a real solution is a vaccine. ""Others are working on that. Developing a vaccine, however, quickly takes two years. The medicine from us will be there, if it all works, sooner."""

You have animals of different species kept in close quarters and they are slandered and their meat sold on the spot.  Lot's of blood and feces from these different animals are present.  Viruses can more easily spread from animal to animal and then finally to human.  Coronavirus apparently came from a bat that went to another animal and then to humans.  The wet markets in China are responsible for a lot of global pandemics.  SARS in the 2000s came about the exact same way, from a wet market in China.  This new coronavirus is their fault.  So warming up to China for helping is like warming up to a school bully for getting you tissue for your bloody nose after he punched you.

If these wet market conditions are allowed to continue, and they probably will because of the profit garnered from them, another new deadly virus after this one is inevitable."

I mean, that China is floating around this supposition that the US was the real original source of the virus [as per the NY Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/13/world/asia/coronavirus-china-conspiracy-theory.html) is just the latest in a slew of statements by Chinese officials that China wasn‚Äôt the source.

It affects their businesses and ability to live their lives normally. It's also completely irrational. 

You can argue it's morally wrong, but it's certainly not irrational. You know it's not. I'll spell it out for you: Chinese people in Ireland have more contact with China than any other easily-identifiable group. So, they were closer in epidemiological terms to the source of the outbreak. So, from a purely rational point of view, it makes sense to de-emphasise contact with Chinese people.

For what it's worth, the same logic applies even more strongly to Italians in Ireland (who tend to travel back and forth to Italy more than Chinese do to China because it's closer), and yet I've heard no-one claiming that Italians' hurt feelings outweigh the importance of taking sensible precautions. Why is that? 

I'll tell you why I think. The CCP has a habit of totally cynically claiming that any criticism of China or Chinese govt policy ""hurts the feeling of the Chinese people"" and/or is racist. For example, they've been on a wild hunt against basically anyone who identifies this virus with China (e.g. by called it the Wuhan coronavirus; the WHO was leant on to change this name and promote ""covid""). This defence of Chinese businesses under the guise of defeating racism originated as a totally cynical strategy. Like why are people not claiming it's racist to avoid Italian restaurants?"

Still had 70k points of the itinerary that had not yet been used. Because it was a partial amount, UA rep could only issue a travel credit for the 70k points on that itinerary and I would have up to a year to call back and rebook travel using the credit on this itinerary.

There is no doubt that the medical staff in Iran are doing the best job they can, and obviously when the regime invites WHO or any international organization, they are going to show them exactly what they want them to see. However, it doesn't take a genius to see how the big picture. 

1 - When the virus first broke out, many countries halted flight to China. The regime in Iran, did the exact opposite. Since they portray themselves as being very anti-West, they depend heavily on China, their top trade partner, just to sustain their rule. Zarif even falsely told the nation that ‚ÄúChina not only stopped the outbreak of this contagious disease from getting worse in the country (China), but contained its spread at the international level as well.‚Äù encouraging even more technicians from China to continue coming to Iran, specifically to Qom, which is home to many Chinese-backed infrastructure projects.

2- In late January, cases of coronavirus started to be reported inside Iran. The regime ignored this and issued arrest warrants against anyone who spread such ‚Äúrumors‚Äù.  

3 - As the number of cases grew, they could no longer hide the fact that people were being infected in large numbers. Instead of implementing quarantines, the regime went on to publicly call it ‚Äúa practice from the Stone Age‚Äù. In fact, they made matters worse, they refused to shut down the holy sites in Qom, the hardest hit part of the country.

4 - Meanwhile, the Zarif, the cunning mouthpiece of the regime, proudly sent 3 million masks to China, ignoring the fact that Iranians are in dire need of those masks. Shortly after this, he tweets about how ‚Äúbecause of U.S sanctions‚Äù Iran does not have enough masks.

5 - They blame their incompetence and lack of care for the lives of Iranians on sanctions even though there have never been sanctions on medical supplies to Iran, and in fact, a large sum of medical supplies have been sent to Iran only to be hoarded by those connected to the regime. The OP even proves that since WHO entered Iran and brought even more medical supplies.

When it‚Äôs convenient for the regime, they blame problems on sanctions, but in other cases they brag about how much of Iran‚Äôs wealth they send to Hezbollah and other militant groups to literally build amenities for their mercenaries in other countries. The defenders of the regime repeat the same lies regularly, such as when victims of floods, earthquakes and natural disasters in Iran receive nearly no help, they cry foul and blame it on sanctions. Also keep in mind, most of the infections in the Middle East have been linked to Iran. Many of them being religious pilgrims returning from the holy sites in Iran that authorities refused to shut down even when many deaths were linked to them. So the regime bares responsibility there as well.

The number of deaths in the country are exponentially higher than what is being reported. From firsthand experience, I can tell you that the overwhelming majority of the cases are going unreported. The regime has sent their thugs into hospitals to ensure the cause of many coronavirus deaths are reported as something else. They have even sent warnings to healthcare workers and have arrested several people for trying to spread facts about what is actually going on. Nobody knows the exact number of cases or deaths inside Iran, but all I can tell you is, you cannot trust anything that comes from that despicable regime, and the pathetic supporters of the regime who are working so hard to hide all the facts look pretty damn stupid right now!"

Then you factor in that a large amount of cases are of asymptomatic spread, which therefore aren't getting diagnosed, so ballpark that to 0.065% mortality rate overall among the health and young.

For herd immunity you need ~60% of the UK to get it, so assuming that it's all among the lower risk age groups:

I read [an article](https://www.scmp.com/news/china/society/article/3075027/coronavirus-why-did-chinas-multimillion-dollar-early-warning) on SCMP which detailed in how the Chinese equivalent is far less effective:

> The Sars experience drove Beijing‚Äôs leadership to overhaul its infectious disease control system in a bid to prevent a future epidemic and, according to a former CDC official, in its early years at least the system worked well.

As China battles to contain the new coronavirus epidemic, questions are being asked about the failure of its multimillion-dollar, state-of-the-art early warning system, set up in the wake of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (Sars) outbreak which cost the country 349 lives and more than 200 billion yuan (US$28.6 billion) in economic losses.
Just one year ago, in March 2019, Gao Fu, director of China‚Äôs Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) told reporters that, while a virus could emerge at any time, it would not in future cause an epidemic on the scale of Sars in 2002-03.
The claim has backfired badly. The new virus ‚Äì which emerged in Wuhan, capital of the central Chinese province of Hubei, in December and has now been declared a pandemic by the World Health Organisation ‚Äì is from the same family of germs as Sars and, like its close cousin 17 years ago, probably originated in wild animals.
The Sars experience drove Beijing‚Äôs leadership to overhaul its infectious disease control system in a bid to prevent a future epidemic and, according to a former CDC official, in its early years at least the system worked well.


‚ÄúWe spent 730 million yuan to build a reporting and early warning system for the CDC after Sars,‚Äù Yang Gonghuan, former CDC deputy director, said.

‚ÄúIt did well for the avian flu and plague, although they were of much smaller scale than the coronavirus.‚Äù

But not when it came to COVID-19

> Yang said she was dismayed the system had failed to raise the red flag it was designed to when the new coronavirus struck.

> ‚ÄúFor the whole of December when the disease happened, I have learned that the system was not put into use. I was very surprised [that happened] at the time,‚Äù she said.

Relevant to our discussion, the US CDC is brought up as a positive example:

> Professor Chen Zhuo, a former senior health economist with the US CDC and now an associate professor at the University of Georgia, said Chinese doctors lacked incentive to do their jobs properly. In contrast, he said, the US CDC had set up a foundation to encourage doctors to report emerging infectious diseases.

> ‚ÄúThis is an important incentive reward,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThe importance of public health is not being appreciated in China. Governments at different levels invest little in public health. In some areas, the CDC offices have been downsized, although few have been upgraded during the outbreak.‚Äù

>Compared with its American counterpart, the Chinese disease watchdog operates on a much tighter budget. Last year, the total allocation for the National Health Commission ‚Äì which includes the CDC ‚Äì was about 22 billion yuan, or roughly a quarter of the US CDC‚Äôs budget.

> Chen Xi, assistant professor at Yale School of Public Health, said both CDCs had been criticised for their mistakes, but the US body had much greater power to correct its own actions.
‚ÄúThe issue with the US CDC is very different from the issue with China CDC in terms of power. They have enough power to do many things. They can regulate the standards of testing, but the China CDC has no authority,‚Äù he said.

Yet the American response was completely bungled, despite various Chinese experts favourably comparing the US CDC with harsh criticism to the Chinese CDC. And China had invested in their CDC precisely because they wanted to avoid the SARS/MERS epidemic, too. 

Baseline state capacity ultimately appears to triumph in a time of a fast-moving crisis even when the starting conditions in terms of planning may not favour you. The flaws in the Chinese CDC were overcompensated for by a more refined and coherent state machinery whereas the US CDC is by all accounts a better organisation than their Chinese counterparts but that Counts or little when the overall state capacity (particularly at the very top) is much weaker."

short version: parts of Austria are under quarantine, restaurants, bars and caf√®s have to close after 3pm and 'non-essential' shops are closed permanently (exceptions are pharmacies, grocery-stores, petrol-stations, tobacco-stores) starting Monday.

Confirmed cases as of 14.03.2020 08:00am:  [604](https://translate.google.com/translate?hl=&sl=de&tl=en&u=https%3A%2F%2Forf.at%2Fcorona%2Fstories%2F3157533%2F)

&#x200B;

First part of the article:

# Many shops close on Monday

**Chancellor Sebastian Kurz (√ñVP) announced in a press conference on Friday that social life would be reduced to a minimum as of Monday - this is necessary to protect older and vulnerable people from the corona virus.** **Many stores are closed.** **Two areas are already quarantined in Tyrol.**  
 

Shops will remain closed from Monday - but this does not apply to grocery stores, pharmacies, drugstores, post offices, banks and other shops that are necessary for basic services, Kurz said. There are also exceptions for tobacco shops and petrol stations. The animal feed trade also remains open. Shops for medical products and medical aids are also allowed to continue to open, as are those that offer safety and emergency products as well as maintenance work. Public transport also remains in place.

As of next week, restaurants, bars and coffee shops will only be open until 3 p.m. There are only exceptions for mere guest accommodation and delivery services. Of course, this also means that pure nightclubs such as bars, discos and nightclubs will probably remain completely closed.

Austria will be brought down to minimal operation for a while, said the Chancellor. This is necessary in order to best protect older people and vulnerable groups. ""As the Republic of Austria, we are a team in which everyone has to make their contribution,"" said Kurz. In addition to the restrictions in public life, according to the Chancellor, companies are also encouraged to enable their employees to do teleworking where possible.

## Areas in Tyrol under quarantine

In addition, two areas in Tyrol that have been particularly affected by the corona virus have been quarantined for two weeks by decision of the federal government since Friday. The Paznaun Valley is affected with tourism hotspots such as Ischgl and Galt√ºr as well as St. Anton am Arlberg - more about this in [**tirol.ORF.at**](https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&rurl=translate.google.com&sl=auto&sp=nmt4&tl=en&u=https://tirol.orf.at/stories/3038911/&usg=ALkJrhi7TISh0nItT3gDKu5TQoDsWKC-Mw) .

According to Interior Minister Karl Nehammer (√ñVP), all Austrians who are in the area are placed in domestic quarantine. This also applies to vacationers. Foreign guests, ""who are now in this area"", may leave. However, they should travel to their countries of origin quickly and without stopping. In addition, their personal details would be recorded and passed on to the authorities in the countries of origin.

## Travel warnings for Switzerland, France and Spain

In addition to the existing border controls, this will in future also be used at the border with Switzerland. Air and train traffic to Switzerland, Spain and France will also cease on Monday midnight. The State Department has since issued a travel warning for the three states. This is evident from the travel information for the three countries, which was updated on Friday. For these three countries, the level that had previously been chosen for Italy, Iran and parts of China because of the corona virus applies.

**üì∑**MORE ON THE SUBJECT

### ""Fake News"" around Covid-19

## Fake News Warning

The Interior Minister once again warned of ""false reports circulating on social media"". Reports that supermarkets would also be closed would have ""no substance"". According to Nehammer, everything remains open ""what is important to shape your everyday life"". ""Don't let this news get to you,"" said Nehammer. This was followed by Kurz - rumors, for example, that all of Vienna would be quarantined would have no basis.

## Prevent situation like in Italy

Minister of Health Rudolf Anschober (Greens) referred to the situation in Italy in view of the new measures. The ""partially reads like a war report,"" said the Minister of Health. He pointed out that the number of deaths in Italy is increasing every day. The aim of the Austrian government is to avoid a situation like in Italy with all democratic possibilities.

Austria would focus on three strategic priorities. First, it is about reducing direct social contact and thus saving time. A second step is to protect hospital infrastructure. There will be a visit ban in all hospitals. The only exceptions are children's and palliative care units.

Thirdly, it is about the protection of ""particularly vulnerable groups who have a particular risk in this situation"": Anschober called ""people over 70"" and ""groups who have serious previous illnesses"". ""For these groups we are expanding this protection program with all measures in Austria,"" said the Minister of Health.

As of 3 p.m., a total of 504 people in Austria were infected with the new corona virus. Most cases are in Tyrol, followed by Upper Austria, Vienna and Lower Austria. Carinthia has the fewest confirmed cases. However, these numbers are likely to increase dramatically. Health Minister Anschober spoke of an increasing contagion rate of around 40 percent every day.

In a televised address to the nation on Thursday, President Emmanuel Macron announced school closures and urged people to avoid close contact for fear of propagating the virus that has killed 79 people in France and infected more than 3,600.

Interior Minister Christophe Castaner on Friday said all gatherings with more than 100 people had been banned. Paris police had already turned down requests for protesters to demonstrate at sensitive sites this Saturday, including the Champs Elysees where violent clashes broke out between security forces and protesters almost a year ago to the day.

""It's Saturday, demonstration day. Some people think that the coronavirus won't touch them and refuse to respect the advice,"" said a riot police officer in front of a heavily armed vehicle blocking the road that leads to the presidential palace.

The government published an official decree on Saturday banning all non-essential gatherings, but hundreds of protesters, some wearing protective masks, began convening outside the Montparnasse train station, chanting anti-Macron slogans.

The yellow vests, named after the high-visibility jackets they wear, were holding a 70th consecutive Saturday of action. The movement emerged late in 2018, triggered by fuel tax rises, and swelled into a revolt against Macron's government.

While protests are now much smaller, anger at Macron's government remains. Saturday's demonstration serves as a remainder to the President a day before voters are set to go to the polls in local elections.

The elections are an important test for the former investment banker with opponents now particularly angered by his plans to reform the French pensions system. His party is not expected to do well.

""We had to come and mark the day to tell Macron that we're still here and that we won't accept his pension reform,"" said one pensioner.

Voters will begin choosing mayors for 35,000 town halls and almost half a million councillors on Sunday, overshadowed by the coronavirus outbreak which is expected to hit turnout at the vote, which is usually relatively high.

Macron decided to go ahead with the elections despite the virus concerns, which have led the government to shut schools and universities, suspend major sporting events, curtail public transport and close tourism attractions. Disneyland Paris became the latest casualty on Saturday closing its doors until the end of March.
