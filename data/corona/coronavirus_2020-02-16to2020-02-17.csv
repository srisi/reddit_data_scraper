2020-02-16,afterwash,answers,37,https://www.reddit.com/r/answers/comments/f4xuk4/who_is_paying_for_everything_due_to_corona_virus/fhviasg/,"Each cruise ship is different. As for the one that touched down in Cambodia (and that Trump unusually decided to thank despite its leader being a despot and dictator), the cruise line is offering them another 14-day cruise, tickets as close to the equivalent to the one that they first bought to start the cruise and of course health screening. The company would not offer cash reimbursements or any sort of monetary payment, as usage of their services once again would prove more productive and an easier way to write off the associated costs, as well as having a chance to profit off of customers more willing to spend, having the initial cost of the cruise waived due to the free 14-day option. Ultimately the cruise line (in this one scenario, not like the clusterfuck that is the Princess Diamond) will not sustain that big a loss, although cruises at the moment are getting a beating due to the very real fear of rapid coronavirus spread due to the proximity of passengers, crew and waste. One passenger from the ship tht landed in Cambodia has just tested positive for Coronavirus, so that shitshow is just starting up. Hope that that part has been answered.

As for Wuhan and the areas of Central China that have been locked down, the government is extending loans, increasing credit limits and providing liquidity to the financial system with the help of state-owned banks and private firms. Loans are being offered at 100 basis points below the norm, and small-to-medium sized firms have been encouraged to borrow this cheap credit and/or renegotiate terms on their current loans in order to have enough cash to float them through this period of time. Many SMEs (small-to-medium enterprises) do not hold much cash on their balance sheet, and therefore government efforts are made to prop up these privately owned businesses for the time being. 

Liquidity has been pumped into the financial system as of the open of the stock exchange shortly after the (official) Chinese New Year holiday ended, but despite the 800 *billion* yuan injected, stocks opened some 15% down as of the first day of trading, with some recovery towards the end of the day but still down as compared to before the holidays. China already has many debt and financial obligations, and has pledged some billions (in USD, not sure of the exact amount but its Googleable) in order to build hospitals, compensate medical staff, pay for patients' medical expenses and provide the medical supplies and equipment needed to keep staff and patients alive in this time of need. Foreign aid (100 million USD from America, not sure about the total nominal amount from the WHO and other international entities) in the form of monetary and personnel have also been allowed into the country, although the delay and hesitation of the Chinese government to allow American health workers into the country has angered a non-insignificant part of the local population.

As for life on the streets and how the local populace is dealing with the crisis, people are allowed to leave their houses for short periods of time for groceries and daily necessities, although any and all personal contact is discouraged, with many small villages or even streets walling themselves off with furniture, bricks or other forms of physical objects. Despite calls for societal cohesion and  helping one another, the paranoia and fear of death amongst the Chinese population is clear, both in the physical expressions and their online conversations, although censors have been quick to clamp down on news sites that are overly against or critical of the government's ineptitude with regards to their ability to contain and even admit the existence of the Coronavirus. 

As for the question of pay and how workers will be compensated, the simple answer is that for everyday a particular factory remains closed or that particular part of the Chinese industrial area remains closed, factory workers will not get paid. Often work is calculated on an hourly if not daily basis, and this is why many of the Chinese that have travelled back home to their rural villages would be anxious to return to work, in order to once again start earning their keep. However prudence and logic would dictate that such a large human movement (among the largest human migrations or movements in history, that happens on an annual basis no less) would be an even bigger risk than locking down large swathes of Central China, and so these workers end up being stuck in their villages, the Chinese working class taking a hit (in their wallets) for the sake of the population as a whole and for the world at large. There is no feasible way for any sort of compensation given the sheer number of workers affected, and so this is the stopgap measure that might prove long-term if the containment of the Coronavirus has not been confirmed. 

Flights to and from China has slowed tremendously, but those are mostly foreign carriers and they will be writing down their losses due to devaluation of their flight slot (writing that off as a loss or depreciation of an asset), losses due to cancelled flights (many hundreds if not thousands now), losses due to decreased passenger loads in Asia in general, losses due to aircraft idle time skyrocketing due to the reduced number of their fleet even flying once a day,  increased wastage of employee time (having the same amount of overhead with regards to their operations and logistics crew, although some centers have been closed down), etc etc. Since most of these airlines are private entities (with the exception of Etihad, Singapore Airlines and a few national carriers), the cost will have to be bourne by them and by noone else. Internal, local airlines will of course continue to run, but the total ban on human movement in Central China will of course mean that these Chinese carriers will sustain losses similar to that of the foreign airlines, only with the impact to those serving the Central Chinese area being the hardest hit. Go to Wendover Productions to get an exceedingly remarkable overview of the airline industry, he truly does a good job with regards to covering it with remarkable detail. 

Ultimately I hope that I have covered all salient points in your query, although I am sure that you have more questions both micro and macro. The developing timeline and story mean that things do move quite quickly, and I'd suggest finding an Asian source of news like the Straits Times or any Asian publication in order to get better, firsthand news rather than hearing it diluted through the lens of an European or American reporter.

1. First off, preparing for 50% of the population to be infected does not mean they think it will. This is most likely preparing for the absolute worst case scenario.
2. The death rate, even in a situation where hospitals are overwhelmed, would not be anywhere close to 20%+. The current rate of mild cases alone [is 80%](https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/most-coronavirus-cases-are-mild-complicating-efforts-to-respond/2020/02/12/213603a4-4dc2-11ea-bf44-f5043eb3918a_story.html), so unless literally every single person who doesn't have a mild case drops dead without medical attention, 20% is an overestimate. This is not to mention the fact that coronavirus seems to be milder outside China.
3. I wasn't going to be to harsh until you called WW1 and WW2 ""minor events"". Are you fucking trolling? WW2 alone killed \~80 million people. That's more than the population of the UK in the first place! If you seriously think coronavirus will not only kill more than 80 million people, but will kill so many people that it will blow that figure ""out of the water"", then I don't know what to say.

> No. Spraying alcohol or chlorine all over your body will not kill viruses *that have already entered your body.*

You can't kill the coronaviruses inside your body by spraying yourself with alcohol, bleach, chlorine, etc. That is pure factual truth. The only way to do this would be to swim in a pool of bleach. Then the bleach would kill every cell in your body and all the viruses. But simply covering yourself bleach would not kill the viruses. So they are perfectly accurate."

The goal of this post isn't to get into some argument about the specific accuracy of numbers - but goes on the working assumption that the reporting on  ""landmark dates"" are pretty close.

See detailed timeline below (or in the Wikipedia page) for specific landmark dates:

* **START**: Some people get nCoV. Medical tracing of virus place outbreak in early to mid Nov.
* **START + between 2-5 weeks**: a symptomatic patient is recorded by healthcare system. (others may have had it, but they didn't stand out enough to be discussed in published investigations about the outbreak.
* **START + between 5-8 weeks**: there is a large enough influx of serious patients that the outbreak stands out from normal flu/cold season.
* **START + between 7-10 weeks**: first death attributed to virus (there could have been others earlier mis-identified as cold/flu or not reported - but this lag from outbreak to death seems consistent with progression in international cases.)
* **START + between 9-12 weeks:** Looming healthcare disaster is apparent enough to call for massive mitigation and containment efforts.
* **START + between 11-14 weeks: Explosion of serious/critical cases.**

There are some very rational/logical reasons to expect this timeline **will not** be repeated exactly in other cities.

1. Active efforts to spot and quarantine cases to slow the spread
2. The initial outbreak in Wuhan (early-mid Nov) can be assumed to be more intense because of local sanitary conditions and lack of vigilance. Wuhan began with high-density community transmission from day 1...

That said, it seems like a lot of communities worldwide (i.e. Indonesia or Cambodia) would be at high risk of this happening there. (They could actually be more prone to high density transmission...)

It also seems unlikely for an outbreak to move any faster than this timeline.

Interestingly, Singapore is at START + 5 weeks (first known case arrived Jan 20th). If they were not actively monitoring I don't believe they'd have noticed the unusual spike in in cases yet (but would be very close with 7 serious/critical pneumonia cases).

**Detailed timeline:**

Dec 1st: 1st confirmed patient showed symptoms. (At the time this was not understood to be a new virus)

Dec 21st: Enough cases of a  ""pneumonia of an unknown cause"" for Chinese medical community to take notice

Dec 30th/31st: Enough **serious** cases that doctors begin raising alarms in their own social circles and Healthcare system in Wuhan an ""urgent notice on the treatment of pneumonia of unknown cause""

Jan 5th:  The number of suspected cases reached 59 with seven in a critical condition.

Jan 10th: First confirmed death due to virus.

Jan 15th: Second confirmed death.

Jan 22nd: Situation in Wuhan projects to be bad enough to begin unprecedented quarantine. 17 cumulative deaths recorded.

Feb 1st: Wuhan health system can be assumed to be completely swamped/out of capacity with 2000+ confirmed serious/critical cases (and an unknown number who were turned away from hospitals)"

First Case of 2019 Novel Coronavirus in the United States 

35 year old male

https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2001191

On January 19, 2020, a 35-year-old man presented to an urgent care clinic in Snohomish County, Washington, with a 4-day history of cough and subjective fever. On checking into the clinic, the patient put on a mask in the waiting room. After waiting approximately 20 minutes, he was taken into an examination room and underwent evaluation by a provider. He disclosed that he had returned to Washington State on January 15 after traveling to visit family in Wuhan, China. The patient stated that he had seen a health alert from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) about the novel coronavirus outbreak in China and, because of his symptoms and recent travel, decided to see a health care provider....

Given the patient’s travel history, the local and state health departments were immediately notified. Together with the urgent care clinician, the Washington Department of Health notified the CDC Emergency Operations Center. Although the patient reported that he had not spent time at the Huanan seafood market and reported no known contact with ill persons during his travel to China, CDC staff concurred with the need to test the patient for 2019-nCoV on the basis of current CDC “persons under investigation” case definitions.8 Specimens were collected in accordance with CDC guidance and included serum and nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swab specimens. After specimen collection, the patient was discharged to home isolation with active monitoring by the local health department.
On January 20, 2020, the CDC confirmed that the patient’s nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabs tested positive for 2019-nCoV by real-time reverse-transcriptase–polymerase-chain-reaction (rRT-PCR) assay. In coordination with CDC subject-matter experts, state and local health officials, emergency medical services, and hospital leadership and staff, the patient was admitted to an airborne-isolation unit at Providence Regional Medical Center for clinical observation, with health care workers following CDC recommendations for contact, droplet, and airborne precautions with eye protection.

On admission, the patient reported persistent dry cough and a 2-day history of nausea and vomiting; he reported that he had no shortness of breath or chest pain. Vital signs were within normal ranges. On physical examination, the patient was found to have dry mucous membranes. The remainder of the examination was generally unremarkable. After admission, the patient received supportive care, including 2 liters of normal saline and ondansetron for nausea.


On days 2 through 5 of hospitalization (days 6 through 9 of illness), the patient’s vital signs remained largely stable, apart from the development of intermittent fevers accompanied by periods of tachycardia (Figure 2). The patient continued to report a nonproductive cough and appeared fatigued. On the afternoon of hospital day 2, the patient passed a loose bowel movement and reported abdominal discomfort. A second episode of loose stool was reported overnight; a sample of this stool was collected for rRT-PCR testing, along with additional respiratory specimens (nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal) and serum. The stool and both respiratory specimens later tested positive by rRT-PCR for 2019-nCoV, whereas the serum remained negative.

Treatment during this time was largely supportive. For symptom management, the patient received, as needed, antipyretic therapy consisting of 650 mg of acetaminophen every 4 hours and 600 mg of ibuprofen every 6 hours. He also received 600 mg of guaifenesin for his continued cough and approximately 6 liters of normal saline over the first 6 days of hospitalization.


A chest radiograph taken on hospital day 3 (illness day 7) was reported as showing no evidence of infiltrates or abnormalities (Figure 3). However, a second chest radiograph from the night of hospital day 5 (illness day 9) showed evidence of pneumonia in the lower lobe of the left lung (Figure 4). These radiographic findings coincided with a change in respiratory status starting on the evening of hospital day 5, when the patient’s oxygen saturation values as measured by pulse oximetry dropped to as low as 90% while he was breathing ambient air. On day 6, the patient was started on supplemental oxygen, delivered by nasal cannula at 2 liters per minute. Given the changing clinical presentation and concern about hospital-acquired pneumonia, treatment with vancomycin (a 1750-mg loading dose followed by 1 g administered intravenously every 8 hours) and cefepime (administered intravenously every 8 hours) was initiated.


On hospital day 6 (illness day 10), a fourth chest radiograph showed basilar streaky opacities in both lungs, a finding consistent with atypical pneumonia (Figure 5), and rales were noted in both lungs on auscultation. Given the radiographic findings, the decision to administer oxygen supplementation, the patient’s ongoing fevers, the persistent positive 2019-nCoV RNA at multiple sites, and published reports of the development of severe pneumonia3,4 at a period consistent with the development of radiographic pneumonia in this patient, clinicians pursued compassionate use of an investigational antiviral therapy. Treatment with intravenous remdesivir (a novel nucleotide analogue prodrug in development10,11) was initiated on the evening of day 7, and no adverse events were observed in association with the infusion. Vancomycin was discontinued on the evening of day 7, and cefepime was discontinued on the following day, after serial negative procalcitonin levels and negative nasal PCR testing for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus.

On hospital day 8 (illness day 12), the patient’s clinical condition improved. Supplemental oxygen was discontinued, and his oxygen saturation values improved to 94 to 96% while he was breathing ambient air. The previous bilateral lower-lobe rales were no longer present. His appetite improved, and he was asymptomatic aside from intermittent dry cough and rhinorrhea. 

As of January 30, 2020, the patient remains hospitalized. He is afebrile, and all symptoms have resolved with the exception of his cough, which is decreasing in severity.


The above patient has recovered and been released from hospital."

""The government is still able to track down infection routes to a certain degree,"" said Takaji Wakita, chief of the National Institute of Infectious Diseases.

The health ministry had hoped for an upgrade to the next alert level, which signals a rapidly growing outbreak with high domestic transmission rates. Such a move would let the ministry switch focus from screening overseas arrivals and tracking infection routes to catching homegrown cases early on and boosting treatment capacity.


""It was a difficult decision, but we are still at the beginning of an outbreak, and the virus is not yet prevalent,"" a member of the panel said.
Japan had 53 cases of the coronavirus as of Sunday, apart from those linked to a cruise ship docked in Yokohama. Despite the decision Sunday, the ministry remains concerned about the increase in patients with no direct ties to China, the epicenter of the outbreak.

""We will bolster measures at home in anticipation of an eventual surge in cases,"" a ministry official said.

One public health expert at Jikei University School of Medicine told Nikkei that he thinks the outbreak is already at the next phase, with infections likely spreading in the country. ""The worst-case scenario is where the one-day increase keeps going up, say, from 10 today to 20 the next day,"" said professor Mitsuyoshi Urashima. ""Once this happens, the government could invoke an emergency law and bar people from going outside."" 
""The best-case scenario is where most infected people recover with mild to no symptoms, which will increase the number of people with immunity to the virus,"" Urashima said."

A less conspiratorial explanation, especially with the CDC saying outright it's ""[at some point in time it is highly probable that we’ll have to transition to mitigation](https://www.statnews.com/2020/02/12/cdc-director-more-person-to-person-coronavirus-infections-in-u-s-likely-but-containment-still-possible/)"" from containment is that, somewhat as you say, they have every expectation that it's here, and realized early on a real containment effort was both too late and would have been difficult or impossible to implement without enough cases here.

Basically, they would be getting ahead of the science, the CDC [has been saying since January 31th](https://otter.ai/s/V4P5IYwFTaOjefIQdbc1JQ) that testing is a mess:

> [...] I want to be clear the current tests that we developed at CDC, is not, we're not sure of the natural history of how the virus is isolated. Can you isolate it one day, then, three days later, you can and we are seeing in the cases that are in the hospital. We've seen people had detectable virus, then they didn't have detectable virus. Then three days later, they had detectable virus. We're using the virus cultures right now and these individuals more to help us learn about this virus. How much asymptomatic carriage in fact is there? So I want people to understand that distinction. We're not using it as a release criteria, because we don't know the natural history of how this virus is secreted. And this is what we're continuing to learn.

And since then we've heard this echoed in at least two other nations.  Best guess is not getting good samples, the test itself is very sensitive, here's the best discussion of this I've found [at the BBC](https://www.bbc.com/news/health-51491763?intlink_from_url=https://www.bbc.com/news/topics/cyz0z8w0ydwt/coronavirus-outbreak&link_location=live-reporting-story).  Anyway, after an initial mistake in the first batches sent out likely due to cross contamination, the CDC and four state public health services are starting to test for community transmission in five major metro areas.  Which should give us some reasonably high quality data.

But see that first link, or [this from Friday](https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2020/t0214-covid-19-update.html.html), to anyone who's willing to listen, the authorities, specifically cited here the director of the CDC, and the director of the relevant CDC center, Dr. Nancy Messonnier, are saying loud and clear, we expect this is going to be bad.

How bad?  They *can't* know, it's very likely it won't play out quite like it is doing in the PRC, different culture(s), different habits that are probably relevant to transmission, different medical systems (hospitals are pretty much the only Western medical establishments in the PRC, and they're very new as this goes), different population exposures to air pollution and smoking, etc."

The proportion of severe and critical cases of the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) among all confirmed cases has decreased significantly in China, the National Health Commission (NHC) said on Sunday.

In Wuhan, the epicenter of the epidemic, the proportion of severe cases among the confirmed cases fell from a peak of 32.4 percent on Jan. 28 to 21.6 percent on Feb. 15, said Mi Feng, a spokesperson with the NHC, at a press conference in Beijing.

The proportion in other parts of Hubei Province dropped from a peak of 18.4 percent on Jan. 27 to 11.1 percent on Feb. 15, said Mi.

The percentage in other provinces in China also decreased significantly, falling from a peak of 15.9 percent on Jan. 27 to 7.2 percent on Feb. 15, Mi added.

""These changes have proven the current epidemic prevention and control measures are effective,"" said Mi.

The authorities and medics are carrying out differentiated measures on the patients with confirmed or suspected COVID-19, close contacts of the confirmed cases, and fever patients, the spokesperson said.

""The differentiated measures ensure that a large number of mild cases are treated in time, reducing the possibility of becoming severe cases,"" said Mi.

No, it's not.

Coronaviruses are the virus subfamily Orthocoronavirinae, while influenza viruses are the virus family Orthomyxoviridae, which is not Orthocoronavirinae's parent. The next step up is order, and they aren't in the same one of those. It becomes less clear after that, but, if you assume that they share the next step up, class, (and you assume that viral taxonomy has some equivalence to animal taxonomy) influenza viruses and coronaviruses are as related as humans and duck-billed platypuses.

But I want to give you a bit of background about how so many people ended up under some form of quarantine, which will hopefully provide some perspective.

The way you wrote your post, it sounds like you think that these massive quarantine measures must be a rational, coordinated response to the problem, perhaps due to information we don't have access to, or some other factor. The gist is, ""how can you think it's not a huge thing when they're putting hundreds of millions under quarantine?""

I'm watching the measures roll out on the ground, and this is clearly not the case. We like to think of China as a centralized authoritarian monolith, where every action is controlled from the very top. [The fact of the matter is that while it certainly is an authoritarian country, decisions are often decentralized, and even uncoordinated, in surprising ways](https://www.scmp.com/comment/insight-opinion/united-states/article/2166576/how-chinas-balancing-act-between-centralised).

The central government has a habit of handing down goals to local governments without providing any specific instructions about how to go about achieving these goals, or funding for that matter. You then have officials at various levels across the country interpreting them in their own ways and taking matters into their own hands. That way, if things go well, the central government can take the credit for meeting said target, and if things go poorly, they can publicly censure the local official and wash their hands of any blame.

This is exactly what is happening right now, and it's happening on an unprecedented scale, all the way down to the village level.

I think a lot of observers from the west are imagining some giant nerve center in Beijing where all these decisions are being made. While I'm sure there is such a nerve center, they are clearly not going through every city's quarantine and lock-down policies with a fine-toothed comb, and probably are not even talking about the rural counties, towns and villages in anything more than a very abstract, generalized way.

Here are the factors officials on the local level are responding to:

\- A scary and poorly understood epidemic

\- The epidemic hitting in the middle of the [world's largest annual mass migration](https://www.scmp.com/news/china/society/article/2183049/3-billion-trips-40-days-china-begins-lunar-new-year-mass) (several hundred million people travel from the industrial centers and major cities, mainly to smaller towns and villages to visit family, and they were supposed to go back to work over a week ago)

\- Directives from the central government to go on ""wartime footing"" to ""defeat the epidemic""

\- [Contradictory directives from the central government to facilitate workers returning to the cities and getting back to work](https://www.facebook.com/ChinaLawBlog/photos/a.10152520838701109/10156634631961109/?type=1&theater) (while simultaneously ensuring that a new round of infections isn't sparked by this)

What we end up with is a crazy patchwork of measures. While the cities hit the hardest have been placed on almost total lockdown, you have a dizzying array of measures everywhere else. We'll often see, in a single city, some apartment complexes locking all entrances and issuing passbooks to residents, allowing each household only one trip every one or two days for supplies; meanwhile, neighboring apartment complexes aren't restricting the movements of their residents at all, and instead just taking everyone's temperature at the gate, and maybe barring entry to non-residents.

In Beijing, [some bars and restaurants are open and allowed to serve customers](https://www.chinalawblog.com/2020/02/chinas-damaged-economy-under-the-coronavirus-really-damaged.html), as long as they take temperatures and register them. As the capital, you would expect the city to be setting an example for an orderly return to work. But they have recently announced that anyone returning to the city [now has to undergo self-quarantine and monitoring for 14 days](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-china-51509248).

Meanwhile, in Kunming, where I live, all the bars are closed, and restaurants are only allowed to provide delivery and takeout. [QR codes have been posted at the entrance to every residential building, open business and public place](https://www.scmp.com/tech/apps-social/article/3050446/yunnan-province-plan-contain-coronavirus-tracking-residents-public), and you need to scan these codes when you enter and exit. BUT, there is no self-quarantine rule in effect unless you have recently visited a hard-hit epidemic region.

Many of the several hundred million currently on lockdown are stuck in villages. It's hard to get an accurate count, but there are probably [well over two million villages in China](https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2015/01/05/372491552/chinas-villages-are-dying-a-new-film-asks-if-they-can-be-saved). Many of them have set up makeshift barricades at the entrance to the village, barring anyone from entering or leaving. Some have banded together to create roadblocks along provincial and county roads to ensure that no one can bring the virus into their area. People have been stuck in these places for weeks now, many of them city dwellers who just came to visit grandma for a few days for the New Year. They can't get back because the roadblocks are not coordinated by one single authority, and drivers are worried about getting stuck between roadblocks, and being unable to either reach their destination or turn back and go home.

Anyway, the point of all this is that while the epidemic is certainly very serious, the number of people placed on one form of lockdown or another isn't necessarily a good gauge of exactly how serious it is. In fact, I wouldn't be surprised to see economists and policy wonks arguing next year about which ends up with the higher body count: the disease or the government's response.

**TL;DR:** The number of people on lockdown isn't a very good reference in deciding how much you should worry."

Also, corporate earnings and revenue growth in those mega-cap companies have been at all time highs. Perhaps the market would be way up compared to where it is now if not for the virus?

There might also be a lot more hedging activity on the industries/stocks most heavily exposed to coronavirus?

The Chinese returnees will be allowed to go home again: On Sunday, the Germans who flew out of Wuhan will be allowed to leave the Bundeswehr barracks in Germersheim.

Since the beginning of February, the Germans returning from China have been in quarantine in the Bundeswehr barracks in Germersheim.

The quarantine for the 122 Chinese returnees isolated in a barracks in Rhineland-Palatinate is nearing its end. On Sunday noon, all returnees and 22 helpers of the German Red Cross are to be released from isolation in Germersheim. The prerequisite for this is that a renewed laboratory test for the new coronavirus must be negative. Before their release, all those involved will be medically examined. 

The departure is to take place under exclusion of the public. Because of the spread of the novel coronavirus in China, a German Air Force plane had flown 126 people out of the particularly affected city of Wuhan in Hubei province at the beginning of February. Two people were diagnosed with infections with the virus upon arrival and were taken to the university hospital in Frankfurt am Main for treatment.

Coming up with a vaccine and treatment IS priority number one (sorry won’t use the technical terms you suggested). It’s just that those if not tested could have more disastrous effects than the virus, so it has to take time. No sense for a vaccine that stops a virus with a say 2% mortality rate, that has a say 5% side effects morality rate... if you are a software consultant and there was some bug which affected 2 out of 100 computers would you release a patch that would affect 5 out of 100 to make it worse not better? I doubt it. (Don’t answer if you work for Microsoft :D)

H1N1 was a flu variant. It was easier to make new vaccines by twitching the old flu vaccines. The coronavirus family, ranging from the common cold to the deadly SARS and MERS is a much more broad classification and the viruses are less similar, so no cheats here. Sadly the media use of coronavirus (name of group not only this one) did nit help.

Yeah, no. At 38 even with mild asthma you are far from a candidate for dying from this virus, as from most other pandemics. Actually your age (say 30-60) makes you “the most immune” to viral epidemics, as some viruses attack the weakest people (so elderly, kids, immunocompromised etc) and others the strongest adults via to cytokine storm (generally say late teens to early 30s). And you are neither group."

First Case of 2019 Novel Coronavirus in the United States 

35 year old male

https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2001191

On January 19, 2020, a 35-year-old man presented to an urgent care clinic in Snohomish County, Washington, with a 4-day history of cough and subjective fever. On checking into the clinic, the patient put on a mask in the waiting room. After waiting approximately 20 minutes, he was taken into an examination room and underwent evaluation by a provider. He disclosed that he had returned to Washington State on January 15 after traveling to visit family in Wuhan, China. The patient stated that he had seen a health alert from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) about the novel coronavirus outbreak in China and, because of his symptoms and recent travel, decided to see a health care provider....

Given the patient’s travel history, the local and state health departments were immediately notified. Together with the urgent care clinician, the Washington Department of Health notified the CDC Emergency Operations Center. Although the patient reported that he had not spent time at the Huanan seafood market and reported no known contact with ill persons during his travel to China, CDC staff concurred with the need to test the patient for 2019-nCoV on the basis of current CDC “persons under investigation” case definitions.8 Specimens were collected in accordance with CDC guidance and included serum and nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swab specimens. After specimen collection, the patient was discharged to home isolation with active monitoring by the local health department.
On January 20, 2020, the CDC confirmed that the patient’s nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabs tested positive for 2019-nCoV by real-time reverse-transcriptase–polymerase-chain-reaction (rRT-PCR) assay. In coordination with CDC subject-matter experts, state and local health officials, emergency medical services, and hospital leadership and staff, the patient was admitted to an airborne-isolation unit at Providence Regional Medical Center for clinical observation, with health care workers following CDC recommendations for contact, droplet, and airborne precautions with eye protection.

On admission, the patient reported persistent dry cough and a 2-day history of nausea and vomiting; he reported that he had no shortness of breath or chest pain. Vital signs were within normal ranges. On physical examination, the patient was found to have dry mucous membranes. The remainder of the examination was generally unremarkable. After admission, the patient received supportive care, including 2 liters of normal saline and ondansetron for nausea.


On days 2 through 5 of hospitalization (days 6 through 9 of illness), the patient’s vital signs remained largely stable, apart from the development of intermittent fevers accompanied by periods of tachycardia (Figure 2). The patient continued to report a nonproductive cough and appeared fatigued. On the afternoon of hospital day 2, the patient passed a loose bowel movement and reported abdominal discomfort. A second episode of loose stool was reported overnight; a sample of this stool was collected for rRT-PCR testing, along with additional respiratory specimens (nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal) and serum. The stool and both respiratory specimens later tested positive by rRT-PCR for 2019-nCoV, whereas the serum remained negative.

Treatment during this time was largely supportive. For symptom management, the patient received, as needed, antipyretic therapy consisting of 650 mg of acetaminophen every 4 hours and 600 mg of ibuprofen every 6 hours. He also received 600 mg of guaifenesin for his continued cough and approximately 6 liters of normal saline over the first 6 days of hospitalization.


A chest radiograph taken on hospital day 3 (illness day 7) was reported as showing no evidence of infiltrates or abnormalities (Figure 3). However, a second chest radiograph from the night of hospital day 5 (illness day 9) showed evidence of pneumonia in the lower lobe of the left lung (Figure 4). These radiographic findings coincided with a change in respiratory status starting on the evening of hospital day 5, when the patient’s oxygen saturation values as measured by pulse oximetry dropped to as low as 90% while he was breathing ambient air. On day 6, the patient was started on supplemental oxygen, delivered by nasal cannula at 2 liters per minute. Given the changing clinical presentation and concern about hospital-acquired pneumonia, treatment with vancomycin (a 1750-mg loading dose followed by 1 g administered intravenously every 8 hours) and cefepime (administered intravenously every 8 hours) was initiated.


On hospital day 6 (illness day 10), a fourth chest radiograph showed basilar streaky opacities in both lungs, a finding consistent with atypical pneumonia (Figure 5), and rales were noted in both lungs on auscultation. Given the radiographic findings, the decision to administer oxygen supplementation, the patient’s ongoing fevers, the persistent positive 2019-nCoV RNA at multiple sites, and published reports of the development of severe pneumonia3,4 at a period consistent with the development of radiographic pneumonia in this patient, clinicians pursued compassionate use of an investigational antiviral therapy. Treatment with intravenous remdesivir (a novel nucleotide analogue prodrug in development10,11) was initiated on the evening of day 7, and no adverse events were observed in association with the infusion. Vancomycin was discontinued on the evening of day 7, and cefepime was discontinued on the following day, after serial negative procalcitonin levels and negative nasal PCR testing for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus.

On hospital day 8 (illness day 12), the patient’s clinical condition improved. Supplemental oxygen was discontinued, and his oxygen saturation values improved to 94 to 96% while he was breathing ambient air. The previous bilateral lower-lobe rales were no longer present. His appetite improved, and he was asymptomatic aside from intermittent dry cough and rhinorrhea. 

As of January 30, 2020, the patient remains hospitalized. He is afebrile, and all symptoms have resolved with the exception of his cough, which is decreasing in severity.

The human body creates anti-bodies, but when those antibodies get ""challenged"" by the actual live virus again, it caused immune cells to rush to the lungs, and then the body attacks itself and it can cause lung *failure*. This is often exacerbated by secondary, opportunistic bacterial pneumonial infections. It can become a *chronic* condition, meaning that human patients with this syndrome may be extremely vulnerable to lung infection and live in a weakened state, sort of with chronically damaged lungs and a form of lupus (chronic auto-immune disorder), for the rest of their lives.

Not to mention, the people with mild symptoms are much less likely to report it to doctors and get diagnosed with coronavirus in the first place. That's why scientists have pretty consistently said that the current fatality rate is an overestimate while the current number of people infected is an underestimate."

Interactive map shows worldwide spread of coronavirus

UW News

POSTED UNDER: POPULATION HEALTH, SOCIAL SCIENCE, UW AND THE COMMUNITY, UW NEWS BLOG

As scientists pin down the origin, governments enact prevention measures and labs look for a cure, news about the outbreak of the novel coronavirus often comes down to two questions: Where and how many people are infected?

A new interactive map from University of Washington geographer Bo Zhao aims to answer those questions in real time.

Zhao produced this interactive map of the coronavirus, which updates every few hours with data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the World Health Organization, the People’s Republic of China, and other government agencies, including those in Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan. By zooming in on various countries – such as China – users can see the numbers of cases, recoveries and deaths, as well as trends over time.

In any case, he's right that on a grand scale coronavirus isn't too much to worry about. A mortality of 3% is high, but there have been much worse pandemics in the past that had higher mortality (~20% for the 1918 pandemic) and were much more poorly contained."

"" Severity remains uncertain, said Dowell. “The reason is that at this stage of a rapidly expanding outbreak, to put it bluntly, most people haven’t had the time to die,” he explained. “The big bulk of cases … have been infected recently. The median time from exposure to death in the early cases was 18 days. So, most have not had time to resolve their case or to die.”

Dowell said it is possible that there may be a large number of mild cases of coronavirus that are undetected. If there is a hundred-fold underestimate in the number of cases, the severity of the outbreak would be similar to the 1957 pandemic influenza, which killed an estimated 1.1 million people worldwide.""

I know he's pretty mainstream, but MedCram did [a video ten days ago](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GT3_A1bf9pU) talking about ACE2.

That part starts at 3:21. He explains what ACE2 is and says ""It is the target of the coronavirus"".

He brings up the idea that ACE2 can be raised if smokes. He says that in China 48% of men smoke and only 1.9% of women smoke in China. But the important part is he talks about the smokers have a higher amount of ACE2. The more ACE2 the more likely the virus RNA can infect a person.

He rejects the race theory because the study that he looks had had such a small sample size, but if these numbers are accurate then it's very interesting."

>I have a lot of respect for health care professionals, but the system, even in the best case contingency planning would be easily overwhelmed. We simply do not have the beds, personnel, or pharmaceuticals even in our absolute worst case contingency planning scenarios.  
>  
>My experience (first responder) is about 18 years out of date, but I can't imagine much has changed, if at all; in the event of a pandemic, nuclear event, or mass causality event it was all based around triage.  
>  
>Authorities would establish a triage SOP and guideline and if a victim/patient exceeded that SOP and guideline, they were simply made as comfortable as possible, quarantined if necessary, and allowed to expire as treatment would simply be a waste of critical resources and materiel.  
>  
>In the scenarios we table-topped and simulated, it made sense to approach it in that manner. Projected figures were staggering, always expected to overwhelm repsonders/personnel on all levels and swamp the system even if operating at peak operational readiness.  
>  
>NO agency or organization operates are 100% peak operational readiness; there is always readiness impact, be it funding, manpower, equipment, ect... just an event itself can and often will have an impact. In the event of COVID-19, a portion of your responders/personnel will themselves become infected.  
>  
>There is also a significant human factor, people have families and loved ones...and they're going to prioritize them over all else. We were always told we addressed our family and personal issues/problems first and reported, if possible, once those had been dealt with, because you can't be effective if your not in the right head-space or you yourself fall victim.

>There is also a sizable incompetence factor, now that is primarily in terms of government response/action.

>The US, has an immediate capacity of 931,000 hospital beds.

>Let's say theoretically only 2% of the US population becomes infected with COVID-19, that's a ballpark 6,600,000 people infected. If 15% of those 6,600,000 are critical, that's 990,000 critical cases...which would exceed the systems capacity.

2. Fatality rate is higher among smokers. The primary area hit has more smokers than the rest of the world on average. 

3. The people that recover tend to take longer to recover than the people that die. So the percentage of people in the hospital that will recover is likely going to be a higher percentage than the current recovered percentage. 
 
4. Western hospitals are likely better equipped to handle patients with Coronavirus than the hospitals in China, especially the make-shift hospitals that popped up overnight.

2020-02-16,Nogoldsplease,China,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/China/comments/f4vr9x/ships_are_skipping_china_and_its_causing_turmoil/fhvviya/,"February 2020 will come to be remembered as a period of historic disruption to physical supply chains the world over, as the coronavirus wrecks trade.

Dozens of export sailings to ship China-made goods to consumers from the U.S. to Europe -- think handbags, flat-screen TVs, and plastic toys -- have been canned since the coronavirus crisis escalated last month. Those non-shipments are part of a much bigger picture in which every aspect of global shipping -- from oil and gas through to dry-bulk commodities -- has been upended.

The unprecedented gyrations caused by the virus matter because 90% of all trade moves by sea and China has grown into the maritime industry’s main source of cargoes. The disruptions have left toy makers like Hasbro Inc. and fashion houses like the owner of Michael Kors, Versace and Jimmy Choo struggling with their supply chains. Vessels are idling. And exporters to China face diversions as clients there use force majeure clauses in their contracts to walk away from commitments to buy cargoes.

“All the signs are that there has been a major dislocation in global supply chains and commodity trade as well,” said Caroline Bain, chief commodities economist at Capital Economics. For some products “it’s only going to get worse in February data.”

Even at a most-basic level, shippers are struggling to sort out the necessary paperwork required for shipments involving China, snarling some trades in an industry where many transactions need physical documentation to accompany consignments.

All this has come about because the virus has led to hundreds of millions of people being told to stay away from work or education in China, squeezing output in the world’s fastest-growing major economy.

Container vessels that routinely move goods worth hundreds of millions of dollars in single shipments are at the sharp end of the turmoil. The number of blank sailings -- where ships don’t load at a planned location -- has jumped since the outbreak began. AP Moller-Maersk A/S, the world’s largest shipper, has listed at least 27 blank sailings since Jan. 31 on its website.

Almost 600,000 20-foot boxes are currently out of action as a result of the virus according to Alan Murphy, chief executive officer of container shipping analysis company Sea Intelligence, up from about half that amount just under a week earlier. Though rates can vary, using an estimate of $1,000 per container, that means shippers had to stomach a hit of $600 million this week. Ships may either be slowed down in the hope that demand improves in future weeks, or idled until things turn around, Murphy said.

Toy maker Hasbro said in earnings this week that the virus is disrupting its commercial operations in China -- from where it had already been seeking to diversify its supply chain as a result of the trade war. Capri Holdings Ltd. -- which owns Michael Kors, among other brands -- said its outlook may be impacted by the outbreak as it wrestles with potential supply chain issues.

There’s a knock-on effect for exporters in other nations too. Containers are typically used in U.S. and other regions to carry those countries’ exports. The lack of liners hauling containers from Asia, may soon mean countries like the U.S. face a shortage. It’s already getting a little more difficult to get empty ones in Canada, said Greg Northey, a spokesman for industry group Pulse Canada.

Nor is it just retailers. Last week, Hyundai Motor Co. temporarily halted some of its car production because of component shortages caused by the virus. Fiat Chrysler Autombiles NV is planning to halt operations at its assembly plant in Serbia due to a lack of parts from China because of the coronavirus, people familiar with the matter said.

The issues afflicting shippers of finished goods are also being felt in energy and commodity markets.

Traders of oil from West Africa, Latin America and the North Sea initially reported weaker demand from China, while some buyers of Saudi Arabia’s barrels have asked to get less than they would normally take for March. There were signs that falling crude prices encouraged some refineries in the Asian country to accelerate purchases.

In gas markets, one Chinese company declared force majeure, potentially allowing it to walk away from contractual commitments. The measure was rejected by Total SA and Royal Dutch Shell Plc. There are now 12 empty liquefied gas carriers sitting off the coast of Qatar, one of the world’s biggest producers. While the precise reasons for the idling vessels aren’t known, the timing coincides with ship diversions, cargo cancellations and reduced demand in Asia since the virus took hold. Oil tankers have been dawdling off China.

Chinese buyers of liquefied petroleum gas that’s used in cooking and heating are re-offering and diverting cargoes elsewhere because of weakening demand.

Tanker, dry-bulk rates have been hindered by the coronavirus

On top of that, shippers of bulk commodities like coal and iron ore have been battered as the virus delayed the resumption of demand after the typically slow China Lunar New Year period. Day rates for giant freighters to move the two cargoes are earning less than $2,500 a day -- a fraction of what they need even to pay their crew.

“You obviously have lost demand that it’s difficult to recapture,” said Frode Morkedal managing director of equity research at Clarksons Platou Securities AS, an investment banking unit of the world’s biggest shipbroker. “You can’t discharge your ship, you can’t load as fast as you want, so it’s impacting the global supply chain.”"

>There are three reasons to think the coming months could prove even more unpleasant for many firms. First, big multinationals have left themselves dangerously exposed to supply-chain risk owing to strategies designed to bring down their costs. For example, many keep only enough stock on hand to last a few weeks, confident that they can always replenish their inventories “just in time”. That confidence is misplaced, argues Bindiya Vakil of Resilinc, a consultancy.  
> The second vulnerability arises from the fact that giant firms are much more reliant on Chinese factories today than they were at the time of the SARS outbreak in 2003. China now accounts for 16% of global GDP, up from 4% back then. Its share of all exports in textiles and apparel is now 40% of the global total. It generates 26% of the world’s furniture exports. It is also a voracious consumer of things such as metals, needed in manufacturing. In 2003 China sucked in 7% of global mining imports. Today it claims closer to a fifth."

> To National Health Commission: On January 5th, 2020, Professor Zhang Yongzhen’s team from Shanghai Public Health Center, along with Wuhan Central Hospital and the CDC of Wuhan, detected a coronavirus similar to SARS-CoV from the bronchoalveolar lavage of an unexplained pneumonia patient from Wuhan South China Seafood Wholesale Market in Wuhan, Hubei.

> They obtained the full genome of the virus through high throughput sequencing. The result showed that the homology between this virus and SARS-CoV is up to 89.11% and therefore, the researchers named it Wuhan-Hu-1 coronavirus (WHCV). Because we only have samples from one critically ill patient, we analyzed their symptoms as well as the clinic features of other patients.

> We then came to the conclusion that unexplained pneumonia in Wuhan South China Seafood Wholesale Market is caused by WHCV. Because WHCV has a shared ancestory with SARS-CoV, it should also spread through the respiratory system. We hereby suggest taking corresponding prevention and control measures in public places and using antiviral treatment in clinical settings.

From the article: “
In terms of the virus data, the number of cumulative deaths reported is described by a simple mathematical formula to a very high accuracy, according to a quantitative-finance specialist who ran a regression of the data for Barron’s. A near-perfect 99.99% of variance is explained by the equation, this person said.

Put in an investing context, that variance, or so-called r-squared value, would mean that an investor could predict tomorrow’s stock price with almost perfect accuracy. In this case, the high r-squared means there is essentially zero unexpected variability in reported cases day after day.

Barron’s re-created the regression analysis of total deaths caused by the virus, which first emerged in the central Chinese city of Wuhan at the end of last year, and found similarly high variance. We ran it by Melody Goodman, associate professor of biostatistics at New York University’s School of Global Public Health.

“I have never in my years seen an r-squared of 0.99,” Goodman says. “As a statistician, it makes me question the data.”

Real human data are never perfectly predictive when it comes to something like an epidemic, Goodman says, since there are countless ways that a person could come into contact with the virus.

For context, Goodman says a “really good” r-squared, in terms of public health data, would be a 0.7. “Anything like 0.99,” she said, “would make me think that someone is simulating data. It would mean you already know what is going to happen.”

There’s one scenario where the data could be understandably jiggered, Goodman said. Because there are privacy concerns around public health data, it’s conceivable that someone would simulate the data based on real data, so as to make the individuals unidentifiable. But even then, the r-squared in this case is extraordinarily high. Moreover, says Goodman, when data are manipulated to protect privacy, it would need to be disclosed; there is no such disclosure on the WHO site.

What does this mean for investors and analysts? If something seems too good to be true, it probably is.”

I have to disagree with this statement for one key reason:  [China has almost 2.5x the number of smokers as the US/UK/Canada/Australia/etc.](http://gamapserver.who.int/gho/interactive_charts/tobacco/use/atlas.html)

We know the virus directly [attacks lung cells](https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2020/02/14/805289669/how-covid-19-kills-the-new-coronavirus-disease-can-take-a-deadly-turn) and that can lead to death, so it seems logical that these rates will be far lower in those western countries with much lower smoking rates."

➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖

**(1)** *protection against low interest rates (at 5,000 year lows)*

It’s now normal that your bank pays near (0%) interest on your savings. The IMF (et al.) may transition to negative interest rates, as low as (-4%):


**https://imgur.com/a/dFjaYDR**


This makes savings in fiat currency earn far less than the inflation rates in healthcare, childcare, housing, utility bills, insurance, & food:


**https://imgur.com/a/SQbWPKi**


For institutions, governments, & pension funds - there is between $13 - $17 trillion in negative yielding bonds (providing a negative return):


**https://imgur.com/a/vRsFbHj**


➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖

**(2)** *protection against global systemic risks (economic & geopolitical)*


Cryptocurrency is a relatively un-correlated asset class (that also sits somewhat outside of the banking system):


*""Crypto is seen by many of Fidelity’s [institutional] clients as the ultimate non-correlated asset, it will be the best alternative for diversification. As a relative safe haven from political and economic uncertainty, crypto will move to the fill the gap left when world events affect the financial system and more traditional types of asset start to seem less dependable.""*


**https://imgur.com/a/77gQdyC**

Systemic issues include: 


**a)** $250 trillion in global debt (with further Quantitative Easing to continue):


**https://imgur.com/a/HEMQArH**


**b)** >$400 trillion in assets at risk globally (potentially to suffer severe depreciation in value):


**https://imgur.com/a/ZBd1KB6**


**c)** bank bail-ins and bank bail-outs: 


Where tax payers have forked out more than $24 Trillion (**https://imgur.com/a/UeEppZB**) to bail-out failing banks from the last “big recession”, in a system that is unsustainable by design. 


And where depositors across the world are increasingly likely to have their savings confiscated in a severe “crisis-event” via bail-ins. Or for example in *Cyprus*, or Australia’s *Crisis Resolution Powers (and Other Measures) Act 2018, of the Banking Act 1959*

**(d)** escalating trade wars

**(e)** Pandemics (e.g. Coronavirus), social unrest, rioting, & war
In times of crisis, the added mobility that comes with a digital asset (that you control the keys for) could potentially save your life (or at least preserve the value of your assets). 


➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖

**(3)** *protection against capital controls* 


**a)** restrictions on how much fiat you can withdraw per day from an ATM or branch (particularly critical during a crisis event)

**b)** the transition to a centralized cashless society (where access to your own wealth can be completely switched off, censored, confiscated, or rejected).


**c)** where your balance is shared to numerous 3rd parties (without your consent). 

**d)** restrictions on how much you can move overseas (borderless vs bordered money)


**e)** where medium/large-size purchases require inquiry (and consent) from the bank 

**f)** legacy financial systems can operate incredibly slowly

Moving sizeable amount of money around can sometimes take weeks.

➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖

**(4)** *to reinvigorate the urge to save money towards a better future*


Money that aims to appreciate in value encourages people to save for a better future by providing incentives in which to save excess earnings/capital. 

As opposed to the disincentives encouraged by legacy banking systems that make people spend money (and go further into debt):

**a)** 59% of Americans (192.93 million) live payday-to payday, 40% would struggle to cover a $400 emergency 

**b)** Half of Canadians have $200 or Less in savings

**c)** 33% of Americans have less than $5,000 saved for retirement

https://imgur.com/a/m2uadnU

➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖

**(5)** *Vs Gold & Silver bullion*

**a)** gold is completely centralized, which may have ramifications on its usefulness as a SoV:

**[LINK REDACTED]**

**b)** gold has been captured by the derivatives market for decades, leading to ongoing price suppression via the futures markets:

**https://imgur.com/a/Xt0N74M**


With the supply of physical gold completely captured (above),  Central Banks may never lose control of their price manipulation scheme over gold bullion, making it useless at doing what it is intended to do (appreciate against the devaluation of fiat currencies). 

**c)** physical vs digital

Gold lacks portability. It’s more easily confiscated at checkpoints during crisis, and is more difficult and expensive to store, transport, and exchange.


**https://imgur.com/a/BlHgXFB**

➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖

**(6)** *as Medium of exchange (MoE)*


**a)** lower transaction & merchant fees

**b)** censorship-resistance for both buyers and merchants 

Accounts can be frozen, for purchasing or selling products that are not illegal, but are not mandated by a centralized entity.  

**c)** seamless international payments (remittances)


Cryptocurrency makes international trade more accessible and friction-less. Reducing fees, barriers, and restrictions to trade.

**d)** money arrives much faster (less clearing time)

2020-02-16,Murranji,AusFinance,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/AusFinance/comments/f4k7lr/invest_in_the_stock_market_now_or_wait_for_a/fhw7jra/,"The thing about this subreddit is most of the people are permabulls who don't/haven't learned to trade technically so just recommend going long 100% of the time and via an ETF.

I'm not a permabear but you would reckless to start investing here (or at least going all in).

On a macro status the global economy is weak, most countries outside of the USA are posting either negative growth (Japan GDP down 6.3% last quarter) or just barely eking out growth (Germany 0.4% last quarter, Australia 0.4% Q3). Australia's Q4 and Q12020 GDP is very likely to be negative due to the impacts of the bushfire, retail recession, and depending on when the impacts of coronavirus related disruptions start flowing through.

On Coronavirus most of China is lockdown/quarantine to try to stop the spread of the virus and will remain so for weeks until its clearly under control. This is going to cause huge manufacturing and supply chain disruptions since many companies manufacture or source goods from China. Already Iron Ore inventories are starting to build up because the chinese steel mills are shut down which means companies like FMG are going to need to stop operating until the oversupply is gone. This all adds up to a very bearish macro picture.

So given this why is the stock market not falling? Primarily because at the end of 2018 markets crossed a moral hazard when central banks across the world slashed interest rates and went on huge liquidity injection. The US Fed has been pumping billions of dollars into the market via 'not-QE' and repo operations. This moral hazard means that markets are ignoring what is an obvious huge disruption event to the global economy.

&#x200B;

On a technical level the XJO has tested a trend line 3 times and failed at 3 points - first in August 2018 which market that years high and preceded a 20% drop in the market into December. Second was the 31 July high in 2019, after that markets pulled back about 400 points and spend the next half year trading range bound below that high. It finally broke above it in January and then hit the trend line again, and failed it. Depending on when it is tested over the next few days/weeks between 7180 to 7200 if it fails there again you are likely to see a significant sell off.

If it breaks above then the next obvious resistance point is 7360. If/when it hits that there's also likely to be a significant selling reaction - if not start of the bear market itself.

Look at this way - the stock market has rallied 1715 points in the last 15 months, the fastest it has rallied non-stop since the hugely oversold lows of 2009 into 2010. The stock market is doing nothing but rally in the face of low growth across the world, while systemic risks pile up while equity markets ignore them. Most yield curves across the world are inverted (ie bond market signally interest rates which are already at the lowest they are in history are too high). If you look at the XJO chart the closest analogue is the start of 2007 when stock markets paused after a strong rally. The people telling you to go long now would be the same people in 2007 telling you to go long because look how strong equity markets are/can't time the market etc etc.

All just my opinion. If you do want to go long at the very least I'd only invest half of your money and keep the rest in savings for when the inevitable crash comes."

Per https://www.theguardian.com/environment/datablog/2009/sep/02/carbon-emissions-per-person-capita , the number is 4.6 tons per year. Most of those who have died are over the age of 60, so let's just assume that there is 20 years of life lost per death. That means there is about 3 million tons of CO2 saved, giving the 32k deaths (Which, BTW, Coronavirus is only at 1775 as of today)

How much CO2 a tree will absorb is a bit tricky, but let's go with 2 tons. I've seen measurements between 1-7 tons, so let's just go with this. Thus, 20 million trees is 40 million tons of CO2 absorbed over the lifetime.

The numbers are off by an order of magnitude, but not completely wrong. If you assume a person in the US, and assume a lifetime of 70 years or so, the numbers are very close. The math doesn't check out when you look at how much lifetime was removed from a person, and only consider China."

SEOUL—As the [Covid-19 virus ](https://www.wsj.com/articles/what-we-know-about-the-wuhan-virus-11579716128?mod=article_inline)began to spread last month, South Koreans didn’t have to wonder if they may have crossed paths with one of the country’s confirmed cases. 

Patient No. 12 had booked seats E13 and E14 for a 5:30 p.m. showing of the South Korean film, “The Man Standing Next.” Before grabbing a 12:40 p.m. train, patient No. 17 dined at a soft-tofu restaurant in Seoul. Patient No. 21 drove her car to attend a weekday evening church service.

The reports, a digital diary of the individual’s life a few days before contracting the coronavirus, are made public on a Ministry of Health and Welfare website. Travel details of all 29 confirmed cases are noted in bullet points. 

The online travel logs are made possible by one of the most ambitious tracking apparatuses in Asia. Health authorities can sift through credit-card records, CCTV footage, mobile-phone location services, public-transport cards and immigration records to pin down the travel histories of those infected or at risk. 

Along with other preventive measures such as entry bans and quarantines, the tracking system has been used to limit the spread of the virus from China, [the source of the outbreak](https://www.wsj.com/articles/scientists-link-china-virus-to-intersection-of-humans-and-wildlife-11580997600?mod=article_inline). As of Saturday, South Korea has 29 confirmed Covid-19 cases, a modest total compared with China’s other neighbors but still the sixth-largest number after China, Singapore, Hong Kong, Thailand and Japan. While at least nine out of its cases were locally transmitted, no patients have required intensive-care treatment.

Other Asian governments have deployed tracking methods and shared the whereabouts of infected individuals, though their information is often cribbed together from face-to-face interviews. China, home to the majority of the more than 66,000 Covid-19 cases, [monitors individuals ](https://www.wsj.com/articles/china-marshals-the-power-of-its-surveillance-state-in-fight-against-coronavirus-11580831633?mod=article_inline)with data provided by telecom firms, the railway bureau and airlines. Hong Kong monitors families quarantined at home with electronic wristbands. Taiwan tracks people who are under home quarantine using their mobile-phone signals. 

But South Korea’s tactics stand out for the amount of detail authorities disclose to the public, an approach other countries have yet to adopt as they try to strike a balance between civil liberties and public-health demands. 

As part of the coronavirus-prevention policy, travelers arriving in South Korea from mainland China, Hong Kong and Macau must provide their mobile number if they want to enter. They must also download a government mobile application to report their health status every day. If they fail to report their status two days in a row, the government will call them and eventually try to track their whereabouts. 

Those who become infected aren’t named on the Ministry of Health and Welfare website, and they are notified that their personal information has been collected and recent whereabouts publicized. But patients can’t opt out or refuse inquiries. 

South Korea’s methods would likely face a backlash, if not infringe on privacy laws, in many Western countries, experts say, particularly as the verdict on their usefulness isn’t out yet. 

“We really don’t know a lot yet about the level of transmissibility of Covid-19,” said Linda Selvey, a public-health professor focusing on infectious diseases at the University of Queensland in Australia. “Such considerations are important when considering whether or not to release such a high level of details about a case.”

Use of “big data” can aid early detection and outbreak responses, said Abdi Mahamud, a senior World Health Organization official coordinating a Covid-19 response team in the western Pacific region. “However, this is an emerging field and caution needs to be taken on the interpretation of this kind of information,” Mr. Mahamud said.

Other health experts say digital technologies are becoming a more efficient—and accurate—way to monitor quarantined patients, rather than through the laborious task of home visits or telephone calls. “Using 21st century means of trying to track cases is an exciting addition to public health,” said William Schaffner, an infectious-disease expert at Vanderbilt University.

The reason why South Korean authorities have such latitude today—and the public’s support—results from a national reckoning spurred by a slow-footed response [five years ago to an outbreak ](https://www.wsj.com/articles/south-korea-mers-outbreak-is-over-government-says-1438052856?mod=article_inline)of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome, or MERS, an illness also caused by a coronavirus. The government failed to provide transparency at the early stages of the outbreak when little was known about the virus, according to a Ministry of Health and Welfare white paper published after the crisis. 

The roughly two-month outbreak in 2015 left 186 people infected, 38 of whom died. It took weeks for the government to release critical information, like the names and locations of hospitals where infections had occurred. The government’s indecision led to uncertainty about how, and where, MERS was spreading.

The “index” case—patient zero—visited three different health facilities before being diagnosed with MERS. One of the individuals who contracted the virus from “patient zero” sickened more than 80 others. Nearly seven in 10 South Koreans distrusted the South Korean government’s management of MERS, according to a 2015 poll by Realmeter, a Seoul-based research firm.

The public outcry sparked legislative changes even before authorities declared the MERS outbreak was over. South Korea revised its infectious-disease control and prevention law, handing public-health officials greater authority to shut down facilities and gain access to personal information for those infected or considered to be at risk. 

It also strengthened fines for those who didn’t comply and established a 24-hour emergency center that monitors infectious diseases.

“There are institutional mechanisms now in place to identify movements of these people and publicize them,” said Jun Byung-yool, a former head of South Korea’s Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, who had left before the MERS crisis.

As the Covid-19 threat began to emerge in January, South Korea’s new epidemiological infrastructure kicked into action. Hospitals now take individuals’ temperatures at the entrance. They have set up separate screening centers for at-risk patients and have more special wards in place for treating patients with infectious diseases. Doctors now can check patient databases to see if a patient has visited another medical facility or traveled abroad recently.

More than 55% of South Koreans approved of the approach taken by President Moon Jae-in’s administration, according to Realmeter. Mr. Moon has seen his approval ratings rise nearly 5 percentage points in recent weeks.

South Korea’s infectious-disease response could further tighten. Earlier this month, South Korean lawmakers proposed a revision to the infectious-disease law that would increase the penalty for those who break quarantine rules from 3 million won, or about $2,540, to 20 million won."

Global warming isn't any more of a surprise that cigarettes cause cancer - we've known about it for decades, nobody ever cared.  Except now they have to, because the planet is on the line.

Climate change will bring drought to regions that has never had it before, it will cause a massive shifting of growing seasons, and the extinction of several keystone species.  Food and water will be scarce and there will be famines worldwide.  Look at how [substantial the US's contribution is to the global supply of corn](https://www.indexmundi.com/agriculture/?commodity=corn).  Imagine the recent Australia's fires in the United States midwest.  Fires that would cover Illinois, Iowa, Kansas, Nebraska, and a half dozen other states.  Panic, anger, and war become the new normal.  Unless we can find a way to slow global warming and reverse course.  But how, can this be done, and how quickly must it be done in?  

The quickest and easiest way to reduce humanity's impact on the environment is to reduce humanity, or at least the number of humans in the world.  But how?  War's are useful, but we're trying to avoid that.  You can't just announce that you need less people because that would make people ask why and if they *knew* how dire things were, you'd get global panic and, eventually, war.  Which again, we're trying to avoid.  Disease?  The black plague killed 60% of Europe in just 4 years.  Effective, quick, and devastating.  But, how do you how you infect a global population with a near-terminal illness **without** releasing something so deadly that the ""desirables"" don't also succumb to it?  

And so the antivax movement was started.  Take diseases that are no longer an issue and make them an issue.  Measles, whooping cough, the mumps.  Put them all back in play.  And to top it all off, only the weak minded, the easily influenced, those less capable of critical thinking will be the ones who fall for it.  Clean the gene pool while also cleaning the environment.

And this was working well.  People fell for it.  Kids are dying all over the place.  Time to kick it up a notch.  Coronavirus.

""But the global unemployment rate has been trending the lowest it's been in decades!  Who will do the jobs those people did!?""

Think of the people who are falling victim to the antivax movement.  The recent surges in automation, AI, and robots means they'll either soon be replaced by robots, or already have been."

Seatac and PDX have not been designated as airports where screenings will take place because flights originating from China have been redirected to San Francisco.

CDC still has not changed its rules on who can get tested for Coronavirus, despite the fact that a Japanese tourist infected with the virus visited Hawaii.

CDC formula for authorizing tests:
(visitedChina || hadContactWithInfected) && (fever || (cough && difficulty breathing))

I’ve visited two physicians, both of whom told me I can’t get tested because I don’t display symptoms, though I wanted to be tested in the case I was a carrier (had no symptoms while in Japan). As a matter of fact, one doctor went into a tirade about how the government and the system has screwed up big time if I was allowed into the country and in his office if I had the virus. (I called ahead of time and explained my situation btw) I really couldn’t tell if he was trying to convince me or himself.

I called the Washington state department of health, and they said I couldn’t be tested for corona because I don’t meet the criteria, never being in China and all. They told me to consult a physician if I had problems. I asked them if I should keep self isolating and they told me it wasn’t necessary.

I called the CDC and they gave me a similar run-around answer.

I’m currently home isolating, ordering food off of amazon.

""The government is still able to track down infection routes to a certain degree,"" said Takaji Wakita, chief of the National Institute of Infectious Diseases.

The health ministry had hoped for an upgrade to the next alert level, which signals a rapidly growing outbreak with high domestic transmission rates. Such a move would let the ministry switch focus from screening overseas arrivals and tracking infection routes to catching homegrown cases early on and boosting treatment capacity.


""It was a difficult decision, but we are still at the beginning of an outbreak, and the virus is not yet prevalent,"" a member of the panel said.
Japan had 53 cases of the coronavirus as of Sunday, apart from those linked to a cruise ship docked in Yokohama. Despite the decision Sunday, the ministry remains concerned about the increase in patients with no direct ties to China, the epicenter of the outbreak.

""We will bolster measures at home in anticipation of an eventual surge in cases,"" a ministry official said.

One public health expert at Jikei University School of Medicine told Nikkei that he thinks the outbreak is already at the next phase, with infections likely spreading in the country. ""The worst-case scenario is where the one-day increase keeps going up, say, from 10 today to 20 the next day,"" said professor Mitsuyoshi Urashima. ""Once this happens, the government could invoke an emergency law and bar people from going outside."" 
""The best-case scenario is where most infected people recover with mild to no symptoms, which will increase the number of people with immunity to the virus,"" Urashima said."

Some will openly disagree with the brethren on it, because they've been indoctrinated to believe that gun violence is a huge problem and the *only* solution to the violent crime careening out of control in our society (it isn't) is to throw guns at the problem. Guns for teachers. Guns for pastors and parishioners. When they learn that TCoJCoL-dS buildings are gun-free zones, it bothers some that their leaders would force them to attend a death factory for two hours a week, and others just quietly bring guns anyway, as if the church policy were just a smokescreen to trick the ""bad guys"" into thinking they're defenseless.

 ihttps://www.straitstimes.com/asia/east-asia/reporters-notebook-life-and-death-in-a-wuhan-coronavirus-icu: 

“I've observed that the breakout period of the novel coronavirus tends to be three weeks, from the onset of symptoms to developing difficulties breathing. Basically going from mild to severe symptoms takes about a week. There are all sorts of mild symptoms: feebleness, shortness of breath, some people have fevers, some don't. Based on studies of our 138 cases, the most common symptoms in the first stage are fever (98.6 per cent of cases), feebleness (69.6 per cent), cough (59.4 per cent), muscle pains (34.8 per cent), difficulties breathing (31.2%), while less common symptoms include headaches, dizziness, stomach pain, diarrhea, nausea, vomiting.

But some patients who enter the second week will suddenly get worse. At this stage, people should go to the hospital. The elderly with underlying conditions may develop complications; some may need machine-assisted respiration. When the body's other organs start to fail, that's when it becomes severe, while those with strong immune systems see their symptoms decrease in severity at this stage and gradually recover. So the second week is what determines whether the illness becomes critical.

The third week determines whether critical illness leads to death. Some in critical condition who receive treatment can raise their level of lymphocytes, a type of white blood cell, and see an improvement in their immune systems, and have been brought back, so to speak. But those whose lymphocyte numbers continue to decline, those whose immune systems are destroyed in the end, experience multiple organ failure and die.

For most, the illness is over in two weeks, whereas for those for whom the illness becomes severe, if they can survive three weeks, they're good. Those that can't will die in three weeks.”"

Japan had 53 cases of the coronavirus as of Sunday, apart from those linked to a cruise ship docked in Yokohama. Despite the decision Sunday, the ministry remains concerned about the increase in patients with no direct ties to China, the epicenter of the outbreak.

""We will bolster measures at home in anticipation of an eventual surge in cases,"" a ministry official said.

One public health expert at Jikei University School of Medicine told Nikkei that he thinks the outbreak is already at the next phase, with infections likely spreading in the country. ""The worst-case scenario is where the one-day increase keeps going up, say, from 10 today to 20 the next day,"" said professor Mitsuyoshi Urashima. ""Once this happens, the government could invoke an emergency law and bar people from going outside."" 
""The best-case scenario is where most infected people recover with mild to no symptoms, which will increase the number of people with immunity to the virus,"" Urashima said."

> On the bright side, if a coronavirus infects enough people regularly there will be greater business incentive to develop a vaccine and other countermeasures. That never happened with SARS because it died out, leaving no market for such products.

You can't test the final combination of safety and efficacy without having a population that's being exposed to the disease.  With SARS disappearing before they had anything to speak of, they had no ethical way of doing those tests, or even initial safety tests on humans.  No risk to anyone from SARS, insufficient justification.

Otherwise seems to be an *excellent* article, as I've come to expect from *STAT*."

Maybe a disgruntled whoever turned it lose on purpose.

Publicly reported new infections in the province dropped to about 1,600 on Wednesday—after jumps as large as 5,000 new cases on some days last week, according to data from Chinese authorities and Johns Hopkins University’s outbreak tracker. There were about 2,100 new coronavirus infections reported on Tuesday.

“What we’ve seen is a flattening out of numbers of case, particularly in Wuhan and Hubei province, which is quite reassuring,” Ben Cowling, a professor of infectious disease epidemiology at the University of Hong Kong, tells TIME.Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the W.H.O.’s director general, said that the measures put in place in Hubei appear to be “paying off,” but he cautioned that outbreaks can be unpredictable. “We have to understand it with caution because it can show stability for a few days and then they can shoot up,” he said. “I’ve said it many times: It’s slow now, but it may accelerate,” he said, according to the New York Times."

1, A doctor’s general description of symptoms for the Covid’s first three weeks of illness.

2. A day by day description of symptoms and treatment for the first patient in the USA.


1. Symptoms explained by Doctor ihttps://www.straitstimes.com/asia/east-asia/reporters-notebook-life-and-death-in-a-wuhan-coronavirus-icu: 

“I've observed that the breakout period of the novel coronavirus tends to be three weeks, from the onset of symptoms to developing difficulties breathing. Basically going from mild to severe symptoms takes about a week. There are all sorts of mild symptoms: feebleness, shortness of breath, some people have fevers, some don't. Based on studies of our 138 cases, the most common symptoms in the first stage are fever (98.6 per cent of cases), feebleness (69.6 per cent), cough (59.4 per cent), muscle pains (34.8 per cent), difficulties breathing (31.2%), while less common symptoms include headaches, dizziness, stomach pain, diarrhea, nausea, vomiting.

But some patients who enter the second week will suddenly get worse. At this stage, people should go to the hospital. The elderly with underlying conditions may develop complications; some may need machine-assisted respiration. When the body's other organs start to fail, that's when it becomes severe, while those with strong immune systems see their symptoms decrease in severity at this stage and gradually recover. So the second week is what determines whether the illness becomes critical.

The third week determines whether critical illness leads to death. Some in critical condition who receive treatment can raise their level of lymphocytes, a type of white blood cell, and see an improvement in their immune systems, and have been brought back, so to speak. But those whose lymphocyte numbers continue to decline, those whose immune systems are destroyed in the end, experience multiple organ failure and die.

For most, the illness is over in two weeks, whereas for those for whom the illness becomes severe, if they can survive three weeks, they're good. Those that can't will die in three weeks.”


2. And, this:

Symptom Progression Day 1 to Day 12 From
First Case of 2019 Novel Coronavirus in the United States 

35 year old male

https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2001191

On January 19, 2020, a 35-year-old man presented to an urgent care clinic in Snohomish County, Washington, with a 4-day history of cough and subjective fever. On checking into the clinic, the patient put on a mask in the waiting room. After waiting approximately 20 minutes, he was taken into an examination room and underwent evaluation by a provider. He disclosed that he had returned to Washington State on January 15 after traveling to visit family in Wuhan, China. The patient stated that he had seen a health alert from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) about the novel coronavirus outbreak in China and, because of his symptoms and recent travel, decided to see a health care provider....

Given the patient’s travel history, the local and state health departments were immediately notified. Together with the urgent care clinician, the Washington Department of Health notified the CDC Emergency Operations Center. Although the patient reported that he had not spent time at the Huanan seafood market and reported no known contact with ill persons during his travel to China, CDC staff concurred with the need to test the patient for 2019-nCoV on the basis of current CDC “persons under investigation” case definitions.8 Specimens were collected in accordance with CDC guidance and included serum and nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swab specimens. After specimen collection, the patient was discharged to home isolation with active monitoring by the local health department.
On January 20, 2020, the CDC confirmed that the patient’s nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabs tested positive for 2019-nCoV by real-time reverse-transcriptase–polymerase-chain-reaction (rRT-PCR) assay. In coordination with CDC subject-matter experts, state and local health officials, emergency medical services, and hospital leadership and staff, the patient was admitted to an airborne-isolation unit at Providence Regional Medical Center for clinical observation, with health care workers following CDC recommendations for contact, droplet, and airborne precautions with eye protection.

On admission, the patient reported persistent dry cough and a 2-day history of nausea and vomiting; he reported that he had no shortness of breath or chest pain. Vital signs were within normal ranges. On physical examination, the patient was found to have dry mucous membranes. The remainder of the examination was generally unremarkable. After admission, the patient received supportive care, including 2 liters of normal saline and ondansetron for nausea.


On days 2 through 5 of hospitalization (days 6 through 9 of illness), the patient’s vital signs remained largely stable, apart from the development of intermittent fevers accompanied by periods of tachycardia (Figure 2). The patient continued to report a nonproductive cough and appeared fatigued. On the afternoon of hospital day 2, the patient passed a loose bowel movement and reported abdominal discomfort. A second episode of loose stool was reported overnight; a sample of this stool was collected for rRT-PCR testing, along with additional respiratory specimens (nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal) and serum. The stool and both respiratory specimens later tested positive by rRT-PCR for 2019-nCoV, whereas the serum remained negative.

Treatment during this time was largely supportive. For symptom management, the patient received, as needed, antipyretic therapy consisting of 650 mg of acetaminophen every 4 hours and 600 mg of ibuprofen every 6 hours. He also received 600 mg of guaifenesin for his continued cough and approximately 6 liters of normal saline over the first 6 days of hospitalization.


A chest radiograph taken on hospital day 3 (illness day 7) was reported as showing no evidence of infiltrates or abnormalities (Figure 3). However, a second chest radiograph from the night of hospital day 5 (illness day 9) showed evidence of pneumonia in the lower lobe of the left lung (Figure 4). These radiographic findings coincided with a change in respiratory status starting on the evening of hospital day 5, when the patient’s oxygen saturation values as measured by pulse oximetry dropped to as low as 90% while he was breathing ambient air. On day 6, the patient was started on supplemental oxygen, delivered by nasal cannula at 2 liters per minute. Given the changing clinical presentation and concern about hospital-acquired pneumonia, treatment with vancomycin (a 1750-mg loading dose followed by 1 g administered intravenously every 8 hours) and cefepime (administered intravenously every 8 hours) was initiated.


On hospital day 6 (illness day 10), a fourth chest radiograph showed basilar streaky opacities in both lungs, a finding consistent with atypical pneumonia (Figure 5), and rales were noted in both lungs on auscultation. Given the radiographic findings, the decision to administer oxygen supplementation, the patient’s ongoing fevers, the persistent positive 2019-nCoV RNA at multiple sites, and published reports of the development of severe pneumonia3,4 at a period consistent with the development of radiographic pneumonia in this patient, clinicians pursued compassionate use of an investigational antiviral therapy. Treatment with intravenous remdesivir (a novel nucleotide analogue prodrug in development10,11) was initiated on the evening of day 7, and no adverse events were observed in association with the infusion. Vancomycin was discontinued on the evening of day 7, and cefepime was discontinued on the following day, after serial negative procalcitonin levels and negative nasal PCR testing for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus.

On hospital day 8 (illness day 12), the patient’s clinical condition improved. Supplemental oxygen was discontinued, and his oxygen saturation values improved to 94 to 96% while he was breathing ambient air. The previous bilateral lower-lobe rales were no longer present. His appetite improved, and he was asymptomatic aside from intermittent dry cough and rhinorrhea. 

As of January 30, 2020, the patient remains hospitalized. He is afebrile, and all symptoms have resolved with the exception of his cough, which is decreasing in severity.

The only question really is when you will get it and how badly you will be affected.  The real question then is what can you prevent?  What would you be worried about if you were in Wuhan right now?  First and foremost I’d be worried about food.  In a global pandemic that affects supply chains who is to say that food deliveries will continue?

Im an attorney in Houston - massive international city for those that arent aware lol. The downtown courthiuses are pretty much guaranteed outbreak zones: thousands of people a day coming in and out, waiting in long lines crammed together, lots of international travelers and no means of sanitation.


No hand sanitizer (which Ive bitched about long before this), no preventative measures, screening, etc. Basically a fucking petri dish at all times.


This may sound bad, but there is practical truth in it, nonetheless - the criminal and municipal courts are full of everyday folk that dont know or care about mass hygiene. Was in line with a sick family of Vietnamese nationals the other day, and obviously not trying to point out ethnicities, but in this case that is a consideration considering the commingling of cultures in our massive ""Chinatowns"" - yes, we have multiple. Not to mention our known underground wet markets.


I had a client fly in from California last week into IAH - one of the largest international airports in the US - and shaking his hand made me cringe thinking about their possible exposure.


No one here is taking it seriously. At all. Im getting laughed at by family and friends for pointing out even the mainstream numbers being reported...not even pointing out the likely truth.

Based on what I’ve asked users here on Reddit in the medical field, most hospitals aren’t requiring employees to wear masks or goggles at this time. 

I don’t think we will get to that point unless the break out seems to be no longer containable.

We will act when it’s it’s too late to act! I’m only stating facts based on my post from Reddit users.

My current hospitals haven’t sent emails or even mention coronavirus in the hospitals. This is souther California. I’ve talked to many colleagues that work at other facilities, and it’s all the same.


Hawaii seems like they’re starting to screen at the front door of ER. 

other hospitals in Canada have increased number of ventilators in supply and beds. 

Canada has less confirmed cases than US and it seems as though they’re implementing or gearing up their epidemic protocols.

I’m a health care worker, and I’m just staying ready on my own, and not waiting for the final email to tell us that we need to be wearing masks and goggles.

- my concern :

A patient or EMT walks thru our ER without knowing they’re carrying the coronavirus. As easy as it spreads, they will have the opportunity to expose staff. 

even if the virus isn’t as deadly as it seems, having employees out for 2-3 weeks is not sustainable. 

Our frontline staff is very important to maintaining a proper health care facility.

It would be of our best interest to gear up and start protecting ourselves while we still have the chance.

Being proactive, even if the virus doesn’t spread, would be our best bet. 

sitting and waiting is one of the worst things someone could do."

After about two weeks, the quarantine for the 122 Chinese returnees in Germersheim, Palatinate, has come to an end. The responsible politicians thanked the local population for their calmness.

""The population also saw it as our responsibility for the German citizens who were in the crisis region,"" said Thomas Gebhart, State Secretary in the Federal Ministry of Health, in front of the Bundeswehr barracks in Germersheim on Sunday afternoon. He expressly thanked the people in the Southern Palatinate region for their calmness.

After three tests and a further examination, it was determined that none of the returnees from Wuhan in China carried the corona virus. This is a great reassurance for the population.

“Symptoms and severity

Both seasonal flu viruses (which include influenza A and influenza B viruses) and 2019-nCoV are contagious viruses that cause respiratory illness. 

Typical flu symptoms include fever, cough, sore throat, muscle aches, headaches, runny or stuffy nose, fatigue and, sometimes, vomiting and diarrhea, according to the CDC. Flu symptoms often come on suddenly. Most people who get the flu will recover in less than two weeks. But in some people, the flu causes complications, including pneumonia. So far this flu season, about 1% of people in the United States have developed symptoms severe enough to be hospitalized, which is similar to the rate last season, according to data from the CDC.

With 2019-nCoV, doctors are still trying to understand the full picture of disease symptoms and severity. In a recent study of about 100 people with the virus, published Jan. 30 in the journal The Lancet, the most common symptoms were fever, cough and shortness of breath. Only about 5% of patients in that study reported sore throat and runny nose, and only 1-2% reported diarrhea, nausea and vomiting. Of the more than 20,000 cases reported in China so far, about 14% have been classified as severe, according to data from the World Health Organization (WHO) posted Tuesday (Feb. 4).

It's important to note that, because respiratory viruses cause similar symptoms, it can be difficult to distinguish different respiratory viruses based on symptoms alone, according to WHO.”

Death rate

So far this flu season, about 0.05% of people who caught the flu have died from the virus in the U.S., according to CDC data. 

The death rate for 2019-nCoV is still unclear, but it appears to be higher than that of the flu. Throughout the outbreak, the death rate for 2019-nCoV has been about 2%. Still, officials note that in the beginning of an outbreak, the initial cases that are identified ""skew to the severe,"" which may make the mortality rate seem higher than it is, Alex Azar, U.S. secretary of the Health and Human Services, said during a news briefing on Jan. 28. The mortality rate may drop as more mild cases are identified, Azar said."

US had quite a few less cases than Australia, so they are not comparable.

And example of a country with similar initial number of infections to Australia, would be Singapore. As you know, Singapore has reported many cases of H2H transmission from those initial cases. All countries with similar amounts of initial infections have done the same.  Australia has reported that H2H transmission didn't occur whatsoever. None of the countries who had similar numbers of cases to us has reported zero transmissions. We are an absolute outlier. 

It does not add up whatsoever with the R0 of this disease. We know people with coronavirus transmit the disease to 2-6 other people, on average.

""The government is still able to track down infection routes to a certain degree,"" said Takaji Wakita, chief of the National Institute of Infectious Diseases.

The health ministry had hoped for an upgrade to the next alert level, which signals a rapidly growing outbreak with high domestic transmission rates. Such a move would let the ministry switch focus from screening overseas arrivals and tracking infection routes to catching homegrown cases early on and boosting treatment capacity.


""It was a difficult decision, but we are still at the beginning of an outbreak, and the virus is not yet prevalent,"" a member of the panel said.
Japan had 53 cases of the coronavirus as of Sunday, apart from those linked to a cruise ship docked in Yokohama. Despite the decision Sunday, the ministry remains concerned about the increase in patients with no direct ties to China, the epicenter of the outbreak.

""We will bolster measures at home in anticipation of an eventual surge in cases,"" a ministry official said.

One public health expert at Jikei University School of Medicine told Nikkei that he thinks the outbreak is already at the next phase, with infections likely spreading in the country. ""The worst-case scenario is where the one-day increase keeps going up, say, from 10 today to 20 the next day,"" said professor Mitsuyoshi Urashima. ""Once this happens, the government could invoke an emergency law and bar people from going outside."" 
""The best-case scenario is where most infected people recover with mild to no symptoms, which will increase the number of people with immunity to the virus,"" Urashima said."

The standards, which the Public Health Agency of Canada updated last week, lay out the precautions health-care workers should take when assessing and treating a patient with a possible case of the coronavirus, including what protective equipment should be used.
The public health agency has committed to updating the guidelines as they learn more about the disease the World Health Organization has named COVID-19, which has sickened more than 64,000 people worldwide.
Linda Silas, president of the labour organization, says the safety protocols are inadequate compared to those in Ontario and some other countries.
Silas said the standards assume the coronavirus can’t spread through the air — rather than through droplets — but she contends the science isn’t settled on that front and the government should be taking greater care until they can be 100 per cent sure.
“When we do not know, we have to go for the best precautions for workers,” said Silas.
Nurses, doctors and other medical staff who come into contact with patients must be protected, not only for their own health but to stop the potential spread of the virus, she said."

He was a man of learning, becoming the chief librarian at the Library of Alexandria. His work is comparable to what is now known as the study of geography, and he introduced some of the terminology still used today.He is best known for being the first person to calculate the circumference of the Earth, which he did by comparing angles of the mid-day Sun at two places, a known North-South distance apart.

The only reason other US stuff might be rising is because people are blindly putting money in ""diversified"" ETFs.

Regarding your points, economy 1 and 3 totally dependant on 2. Didn't trump (unknowingly) shift a lot of production lines to Vietnam, India, and Indonesia. A lot of US companies started diversifying their materials after the trade war, and so they are actually better placed than let's say a similar company in Europe which continued to source its components from China.

Economies 4-200 will suffer. But 1 won't, simply because 1's exports are technology, culture, and it's less dependant on manufacturing-related items.

I also think 2-200 faltering will allow the #1's companies to buy up companies on the cheap in other countries, outcompete stuff from other companies etc.

(Also, US just banned people who visited China in last 14 days from entering the US, so I don't think coronavirus would be a danger to the homefront).

Additionally, in the long run (and this is gonna sound extremely cruel), China's suffering will undoubtedly be a good thing for America and it's companies. Hopefully, we will see more production lines in democracies like India, Vietnam, Bangladesh, maybe Eastern Europe, etc. Which are all better allies of US, then China is.

At the end of the day, I could be wrong, but I am here for the long game and am excited by the chance that US companies would have the chance to buy Chinese tech companies, factories, or even game studios on the cheap.

Additionally, my point about the Canadian dollar is valid. It was quite high from 2008-2014 because investor's thought it was safe. It had no relation to Canadian economy (which actually grew safer at the time). The perception of safety mattered more than the reality of faster growth in the US."

2020-02-16,Kujo17,cvnews,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/cvnews/comments/f51dev/why_are_children_missing_from_coronavirus/fhw3fss/,"10 February 2020

The outbreak of a new coronavirus in China has killed more than 900 people, but one group has escaped with minimal damage: children.

Youth can certainly contract the virus. Among the infected are at least two newborns, according to Chinese health officials. But few children are among those sick enough to be diagnosed with the coronavirus, according to an article published Feb. 5 in theJournal of the American Medical Association. According to the data analyzed in that article — and numbers are changing quickly as the outbreak evolves — the median age of patients skews older, between 49 and 56 years old.

It's not entirely clear why children seem to be escaping the worst effects of the virus, dubbed 2019-nCoV. But a similar pattern holds for many infectious diseases, from the familiar, such as chickenpox and measles, to the newly emerged, including severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), doctors say.

""We don't fully understand the phenomenon — it may be because of differences in the immune responses of children compared to adults,"" Dr. Andrew Pavia, the chief of the Division of Pediatric Infectious Diseases at the University of Utah, told Live Science in an email. ""One hypothesis is that the innate immune response, that is the early response that is aimed broadly at groups of pathogens, tends to be more active,"" in children, he said.The innate immune system is the first line of defense against pathogens. Cells in that system respond immediately to foreign invaders. (The adaptive immune system, by contrast, learns to recognize specific pathogens, but takes longer to join the battle.) If the innate immune response is stronger in children exposed to 2019 nCoV, they may fight off infection more readily than adults, suffering only mild symptoms.

Other coronaviruses, including SARS and MERS, also show this pattern, said Krys Johnson, an epidemiologist at the Temple University College of Public Health.

""The case we're seeing with the [emerging] coronaviruses is not that the children are not having any symptoms at all, they're actually having viral pneumonia,"" Johnson told Live Science, referring to the presence of infected fluid in the lungs. ""But because their immune systems are so robust, it doesn't lay them out the way it would as an adult.""

Similarly, Johnson said, adults are 25 times more likely to die from chickenpox than children are. And though influenza can be devastating for infants, older children usually make it through with more ease than adults, Johnson said. Seasonal flu death rates in adults are 10 times that of death rates in children."

This is not surprising but also not world-ending. We are going to see a global recession and slowdown of economic activity if supply chains are disrupted, but we are also going to recover because that becomes pent-up demand that we have to work back out of over time.

The economics are not good, but not crippling on a stand-alone basis unless things get so bad that supplies are gone for good. Possible with enough deaths, but much like the actual coronavirus, we appear to be in a ""bad"" case, but neither the worst nor best case."

8. **Biden** calls out **Sanders** over ""outrageous"" online threats from supporters
9. ""Please, please stop saying that Ukraine is a corrupt country, because from now, it's not true.""
10. Rep. Clyburn on **Pete Buttigieg**: ""Political calculations are changing quite a bit... I like the mayor very much.""
11. **Trump** administration eyes proposal to block jet engine sales to China: report
12. **Klobuchar**, **Steyer** unable to name Mexico's president in pointed interview
13. ""Many of the decisions that are being made in our government right now are going to have long-term negative effects on our communities, on our schools, on our environment and many other aspects of our life.""
14. Over 1,100 ex-Justice Dept officials call on Barr to resign for doing **Trump's** ""bidding""
15. Conway claims **Bloomberg's** comments about women ""far worse"" than **Trump** ""Access Hollywood"" tape
16. ""We give thanks to this beloved country for the heroes who keep us safe and for the God who made us free."" President **Trump** gestures towards the sky while delivering remarks at the #Daytona500
17. **Klobuchar** bashes **Bloomberg** for hiding behind ""airwaves and huge ad buys""
18. Health official: Coronavirus on ""verge"" of becoming global pandemic unless containment becomes ""more successful""
19. President **Trump**: ""As commander in chief of the greatest fighting force on the planet, a force that just spent $2.5 trillion on rebuilding our military, I want to thank you for your service.""
20. WATCH: President **Trump** and First Lady Melania Trump depart West Palm Beach en route to the Daytona 500

I emphasized the presidential candidate name mentions and one description of an embedded image.  Some observations:

* They don't seem to be omitting critical info in **any** of them of the ""clickbaity"" sort they did in the OP.  And it's not like there weren't plenty of opportunities, such as:
  * ""Biden calls out other cadidate for...""
  * ""Candidate calls out Sanders for...""
  * ""Biden calls out Democratic frontrunner for....""
  * ""Klobuchar bashes billionaire for...""
  * ""Two Democratic presidential candidates unable to name Mexico's president in pointed interview""
* Mentioned by name: Trump 10 times (11 if you count his wife's last name; neg: 2), Bloomberg 3 times (neg: 2), Warren 3 times (neg: 0), Klobuchar 2 times (neg: 1), Biden 1 time (neg: 0), Buttigieg 1 time (neg: 0), Sanders 1 time (neg: 1; usual ""outrageous threats by supporters"" smear), Steyer 1 time (neg: 1)

In this sample, Bernie was mentioned once (neutral pic included) and had another (negative) image embedded.  Trump (of course) and Bloomberg were smattered all over the thing by both name and image.  Warren had very positive coverage, with 2 embedded videos.

Anyway, food for thought."

Seems entirely possible that it could pass to other species as well, though it's possible the mutations allowing it to infect humans may prevent it from affecting cats or dogs.

Don't know if this particular cornavirus is the same, but cats can catch a certain type of coronavirus that causes a URI, then subsides and usually they become an asymptomatic carrier. Unfortunately, it can also spontaneously mutate while it's ""dormant"" into a virus that causes FIP, which is basically 100% fatal for the cat. There are some experimental treatments for this which, if caught early can stop the mutated virus from replicating before it causes too much damage and cause remission, but from my understanding it can still potentially come back, and some of the treatments so far do not work on a second infection."

As the US demonstrates. You can't stop people crossing illegal even with all the money you throw at it. Trump's push to stop immigration has only drove the numbers up. 

When they cross illegally, As they will do if you close borders. **You have no idea who is transmitting the viruses and who they come into contact with**

The only reason we can able to contain Coronavirus at the moment is BECAUSE THEY WENT THROUGH AIRPORTS AND PROPER SCANNING METHODS, So we can track them and who they have come into contact with. 

It's not rocket science. 

> ""quarantines"" long predates the use of vaxxcines, and are proven to be highly effective solution to containing and preventing to spread of infectious diseases.

Please cite a disease that has been stopped by border control as opposed to proper scanning, detection through monitoring and eradication. 

You can't because it doesn't exist. All diseases we have wiped out so far have been because of proper measures at airports and borders **without closing borders or tightening measures**."

It turns out those other nations were right to be sceptical of claims nobody had been taken ill on the MS Westerdam after an American tested positive for the coronavirus after leaving the ship.
Cambodia said earlier that all 1455 passengers on the Holland America-operated ship had tested negative for the virus.
Now there are fears hundreds of passengers have unwittingly carried the virus to their home countries, including Australia.
Coronavirus has infected more than 71,200 worldwide and killed at least 1770.

If the virus is allowed to spread uncontained around the world, tens of thousands more people could be infected.
“This could be a turning point,” US infectious disease expert William Shaffner said of the shock development.

This will cause a massive ripple through the entire global economy. To me, that means none of the traditional stonk investments will be ""safe"" in the mid-term. 

I wouldn't be surprised if the recent crypto pump was at least partially caused by this coronavirus. Crypto really has nothing anchoring it into any specific region, thus it's immune to things like a virus crippling a country.

The health ministry had hoped for an upgrade to the next alert level, which signals a rapidly growing outbreak with high domestic transmission rates.

Q: Am I at risk for COVID-19 from a package or products shipping from China?

A: There is still a lot that is unknown about the newly emerged COVID-19 and how it spreads. Two other coronaviruses have emerged previously to cause severe illness in people (MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV). The virus that causes COVID-19 is more genetically related to SARS-CoV than MERS-CoV, but both are betacoronaviruses with their origins in bats. While we don’t know for sure that this virus will behave the same way as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, we can use the information gained from both of these earlier coronaviruses to guide us. In general, because of poor survivability of these coronaviruses on surfaces, there is likely very low risk of spread from products or packaging that are shipped over a period of days or weeks at ambient temperatures. Coronaviruses are generally thought to be spread most often by respiratory droplets. Currently there is no evidence to support transmission of COVID-19 associated with imported goods and there have not been any cases of COVID-19 in the United States associated with imported goods. Information will be provided on the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) website as it becomes available.

To put this in perspective, in the US alone, [the CDC estimates that 5 million people have already gotten the flu this season \(2019-2020\), 250,000 have been hospitalized for it, and 14,000 have died. And that's just this year.](https://abcnews.go.com/Health/1300-people-died-flu-year/story?id=67754182)

Is it a bad look that China threw up their massive quarantine. Sure, to a degree. With the imprisoning of doctors and stuff, yo also have to look at it through the fact that they're also a communist semi-dictatorship. Hell, Google and YouTube are censored there. They control the way that their media works and try to keep a stranglehold on how their country is perceived.

A straw man is a form of argument and an informal fallacy based on giving the impression of refuting an opponent's argument, while actually refuting an argument that was not presented by that opponent. One who engages in this fallacy is said to be ""attacking a straw man"".

The typical straw man argument creates the illusion of having completely refuted or defeated an opponent's proposition through the covert replacement of it with a different proposition (i.e., ""stand up a straw man"") and the subsequent refutation of that false argument (""knock down a straw man"") instead of the opponent's proposition.  Straw man arguments have been used throughout history in polemical debate, particularly regarding highly charged emotional subjects.

As another commenter said, many of the schools are starting classes back up online. This may affect their schedules. Also, everything in China is complete chaos at this moment, so people are moving wherever they think they will be safest.

Personal anecdote: I have a student named Ken. I have trained myself to get less and less involved with students for my own sanity, so I usually just do my best for 25 mins and nothing more. But Ken is my boy. He's been with me since the beginning, about 1.5 years ago. We had instant simpatico. Total sweetheart. His mom has left comments in reviews saying that I have put her in a hard place as a parent because sometimes I'm not available and she'd like to arrange another class for Ken to fill the gap, but he refuses to have class with anybody else. Since the Chinese new year and coronavirus mess, he has had class with me literally every day, often twice a day. Then I was stuck in traffic and missed a class of his about a week ago. After that, it was his birthday and he had a class that day. Cancelled it, and cancelled the 6 or 7 following classes. I couldn't believe that would've tipped the scales, but I wondered. Ken is the only kid I've shared wechat accounts with. I sent him a happy birthday message and he said he was really sad that he couldn't have class with me this week, but they went to the village to be safer from the virus, and they don't have good internet there. Back to our regularly scheduled programming next week.

All of that is to say: it probably has nothing to do with you and you're doing a great job. Take it easy and pay more attention to the amazing review than the cancellations."

>BERGSTROM: Well, there's a wide range of different stories that are out there. They range from misinformation about - simply about the rate at which the disease is spreading, misinformation about how many people it's killing. And then you get some really wild stuff out there like stories that it might have been a bio-weapon - it is not - sort of anything that could capture the imagination, get people scared, get people to spread them further.

>*They could potentially lead to various kinds of disruptions of, you know, normal international relations or normal international commerce and so forth*

On February 18, the Japanese government plans to begin testing all those who remain on board for the virus. Results should be provided within three days. From February 21, staggered disembarkations would begin.

But American passengers who are evacuated will not be tested.

Leggiti qualcosa di finanza, gli investimenti che rendono richiedono tolleranza di oscillazioni altissime e tempi biblici per assorbire gli shock e far correre quando tutto va bene. Cioè l'ideale è 100% in fondi azionari di macroregioni anche mondiali. Per questo si fa con soldi che ci si può permettere di perdere.  Le obbligazioni purtroppo non rendono più.

Quanto investire? Idealmente il più possibile per sfruttare l'effetto di interesse composito e del lungo termine.

Nella pratica l'italiano tipo a problemi nel farlo perchè ci vuole:

1- grande conoscenza di se stessi e disciplina: come reaginsco se perdo il 30% perchè c'è il coronavirus ovunque? sono in grado di aspettare 3 anni per recuperare?

2- Studio di finanza attraverso libri e forum: so perchè scelgo un ETF dal nome inglese anzichè il fondo che mio zio bancario mi garantisce andrà alla grande?

I tuoi genitori sono già un esempio concreto: hanno tutto su di una banca fallita e, se non hanno il conto cointestato, stanno rischiando la cifra oltre i 100k per NESSUN motivo logico. Spostare almeno l'eccedenza in un'altra banca è un atto di sanità mentale obbligato e che farei lunedì, domattina.

**Reddito**: vista la tua attività, farei una assicurazione integrativa, magari attraverso un sindacato che di solito la offre a prezzi vantaggiosi.

Massimizza la contribuzione volontaria (5164€ annui) e decidi di versare il TFR presso il fondo pensione di categoria (Perseo Sirio). Ottieni diversi vantaggi:

-quella cifra ti viene dedotta, cioè non tassata ora ma a parte con trattamento di favore (23% per anticipi, 15% come pensione e ancor meno se la tieni per molti anni)

-1% del datore di lavoro

-accesso a bonus Renzi se lo superi con gli straordinari

-maggiore flessibilità del TFR per richieste motivate. Tra l'altro se metti su famiglia sappi che il tfr si perde, mentre il fondo pensione fa parte dell'eredità."

""The government is still able to track down infection routes to a certain degree,"" said Takaji Wakita, chief of the National Institute of Infectious Diseases.

The health ministry had hoped for an upgrade to the next alert level, which signals a rapidly growing outbreak with high domestic transmission rates. Such a move would let the ministry switch focus from screening overseas arrivals and tracking infection routes to catching homegrown cases early on and boosting treatment capacity.


""It was a difficult decision, but we are still at the beginning of an outbreak, and the virus is not yet prevalent,"" a member of the panel said.
Japan had 53 cases of the coronavirus as of Sunday, apart from those linked to a cruise ship docked in Yokohama. Despite the decision Sunday, the ministry remains concerned about the increase in patients with no direct ties to China, the epicenter of the outbreak.

""We will bolster measures at home in anticipation of an eventual surge in cases,"" a ministry official said.

One public health expert at Jikei University School of Medicine told Nikkei that he thinks the outbreak is already at the next phase, with infections likely spreading in the country. ""The worst-case scenario is where the one-day increase keeps going up, say, from 10 today to 20 the next day,"" said professor Mitsuyoshi Urashima. ""Once this happens, the government could invoke an emergency law and bar people from going outside."" 
""The best-case scenario is where most infected people recover with mild to no symptoms, which will increase the number of people with immunity to the virus,"" Urashima said."

I'm just advocating for a healthy dose of skepticism instead of just taking the Chinese govt. claim that it was poor people eating pangolin at face value, actually accept that maybe that's not what happened.

Oh and since I forgot to address the last part, none of this is unique to them being Chinese. Authoritarians all over the world have shown complete antipathy towards the wellbeing of their people.

I believe the flu has a 0.7% fatality rate and the Coronavirus has something like a 2% fatality rate. 

What's troubling are the fact that the Coronavirus is spreading at a rate of over 2k the last few days. That number could go up the more it spreads as there will be more contact points with the virus. 

Also, the recovery rate is slow. There are more people being infected each day than there are people who recover. Most people take at least 3-4 weeks to make a recovery. There are also many who have been in hospital for over a month (and counting). 

If the virus becomes more serious and more people get infected there may be a shortage of medical facilities worldwide."

Several strains of HIV-like viruses (FIV, which causes FAIDS, which is exactly what you think it is, and is mainly transmitted by biting).

A leukemia virus (FELV), which is often transmitted just through mutual grooming and close contact; not always persistent but can infect the bone marrow, depress the immune system and cause various cancers and opportunistic infections.

FIP, which is caused by a common coronavirus disease that is usually asymptomatic; but in a small number of cases by mutation or immune system going haywire may cause a very nearly always fatal immune response.

FCV, which can become a persistent infection; one strain of which, VS-FCV,  is highly infectious and highly lethal, small pox level shit. 

FPLV; extremely resistant to inactivation in the environment (a year under the right circumstances), quite resistant to disinfectants, highly infectious, excreted in all bodily fluids, can also be transfered by fleas, can shed for 6 weeks after recovery, subclinically ill cats can still shed virus, 25-90% mortality.

Alberta's criteria already encompasses mainland China (https://www.albertahealthservices.ca/assets/info/ppih/if-ppih-ncov-case-def.pdf).

This is the point.  At this juncture we should have a consistent national response.  Can you articulate why that should not be so?

What good is it screening more widely in Alberta if we aren't doing it in BC or in Toronto, for example?  The investment is made in seeing the patient but they could continue undetected, and then we have lost the opportunity to limit the exposure and slow to response.

> However these are just guidelines - to quote Ontario's ministry of Health: ""They are not intended to replace clinical or public health practitioner judgment in individual patient assessment and management."" (http://www.health.gov.on.ca/en/pro/programs/publichealth/coronavirus/2019_guidance.aspx) If a clinician feels that the pre-test probability of COVID19 is high, they can contact Public Health and arrange testing.

Again, at this juncture having a consistent national approach would be appropriate - since travel within the country is not screened and is unrestricted.

> Right now, 99% of reported cases are in China and <1% of patients screened have been positive in BC; expanding mass screening criteria to areas with <1% of cases is really unlikely to be of much benefit.

I'm not sure it's intentional, but your argument appears to be that the lack of patients detected to date is an argument for not making more of an effort to detect infected parties.  On that basis we could not screen anyone and we can drive that 1% number right down to 0?

> Of course there is still debate in this area hence the variation in national and provincial screening criteria, but it's silly to compete with other countries to see who will have the most liberal screening criteria.

What is the debate in this area?  At the moment, we're trying to detect and quarantine as many cases, as close to the point of infection or entry to the country (if already infected) as possible.  The global posture on this has been containment (if possible) and slowing the spread (if containment fails) to allow preparation time if necessary.  

Yes, broadening screening efforts is expected to result in a large number of negative tests.  That isn't a bad thing, it's a by product of screening.  Catching the ones that are positive is the goal.  What is the objection to that?"

2020-02-16,Kujo17,cvnews,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/cvnews/comments/f4zub2/japanforty_americans_have_virus_on_diamond/fhvkhnz/,"Forty Americans are among hundreds with the new coronavirus on a cruise ship quarantined off Japan, a US official said on Sunday, after other Americans on board left for chartered flights home.

The evacuation coincided with stepped-up warnings from Japanese authorities over the deadly outbreak, urging citizens to avoid crowds and ""non-essential gatherings.""

The Diamond Princess was placed in a 14-day quarantine in early February after a former passenger tested positive for the Covid-19 virus.

But US authorities announced on the weekend they would offer American passengers the option to leave the ship and fly home, where they will face another 14-day isolation period. Several other governments also have announced plans to remove their citizens from the ship.

More than three dozen Americans are not going home, however, Anthony Fauci, a senior official at the National Institutes for Health, said on CBS.

""Forty of them have gotten infected,"" Fauci said. ""They're going to be in hospitals in Japan.""

It was not immediately clear whether the 40 Americans were among the figure of 355 people from the ship which Japanese Health Minister Katsunobu Kato earlier Sunday said were infected.

He said that 1,219 people on the vessel had been tested.

Late Sunday and into the early hours of Monday, Americans who opted to leave were brought off the ship in groups. They passed through a makeshift passport control but underwent no health checks, American passenger Sarah Arana told AFP.

They boarded buses driven by personnel in head-to-toe protective suits and were told that the more than a dozen vehicles would travel in a convoy.

""I am happy and ready to go,"" Arana told AFP before leaving the ship. ""We need a proper quarantine. This was not it.""

The US government should have intervened ""much sooner, at the beginning,"" the 52-year-old medical social worker said.

""This was too much for Japan, and they shouldn't have had to bear the burden,"" she added. ""The people of Japan did not deserve this. I am full of gratitude."""

The same applies to paper. I have two different Rhodia pads and each looks and feels different. I find that the backside of Rhodia #16 Dot pads is not as nice as the frontside. The paper sizes differ between the Rhodia #16 Dot pad and the #16 Spiral Dot pad. With the Dot pad I use a clip board and now only write on the front page.

ClaireFontaine paper can be too smooth for some nibs. It is super smooth and super slick because it is coated. It really shows off ink colour. But it takes a little longer for the ink to dry.

Coated laser paper is better than printer paper that works with Ink Jets or Ink Jet/Laser, which is better than Copier paper (think Staples paper.) Copier paper is very absorbent, inkjet is less absorbent, inkjet/laser is less absorbent, laser paper less absorbent. Same applies to bleed-through, with copier paper being the worse and coated laser paper being the best.

Rhodia paper is not as good as Tomoe River. Imo, Rhodia is not as good as ClaireFontaine paper. ymmv.

Read the reviews, look at the Rating spread.

With loose sheets you may need to use a template/guide sheet behind it to write in a straight line. I would probably hold it down with an A4 clip board, with a sheet of 65 pound smooth card stock. Other would just use a few sheets of copier or printer paper underneath the Tomoe River paper. If the paper underneath has fibre grooves then that may transfer to the Tomoe River paper. It will depend on how sensitive your pen / nib is. For example, an EF may feel a little bit catchy. You can therefore module the feedback you feel; if you want a super smooth EF, smooth card stock under the paper should give a different feel than paper bag paper. 

I find Nemosine Singularity and Jinhao pens to be wet writers, so they should be able to lay down a nice wet line that will show sheen and shimmer. A Medium nib will probably show Shading better, as well as Western Fines or Japanese Mediums.

But, as it pertains strictly to Shimmer, I would probably go with the least expensive FPR pen with an Ebonite feed and a #6 Nib, M or B, or even a Stub, perhaps one that takes a converter.

[https://fprevolutionusa.com/collections/fpr-fountain-pen-collection/products/fpr-himalaya-fountain-pen-6-nib?variant=28534285500477](https://fprevolutionusa.com/collections/fpr-fountain-pen-collection/products/fpr-himalaya-fountain-pen-6-nib?variant=28534285500477) is an eyed-dropper pen.

They're on sale this weekend. But paying $32 may not be a bad deal. The one thing I don't like, as far as I know, is that they can only use their own Converters, so one would need to order at least three with the pen: one for the pen, one when the other converter is drying out overnight and one in case one goes bad.

FPR pens, and Nibs, have had questionable Quality Control issues. Beyond the $30 price point I would be very hesitant to buy; ymmv.

It's an Ebonite feed so you will be going through a lot of ink quickly. Same for Flex nibs.

I think a MoonMan C1 might be a good candidate. It comes with a #6 Nib, it is a wet writer, it comes with a Medium nib, it can accept International Standard Long or Short cartridges, it can be Eye Dropper filled, the plastic looks nice heavy, it doesn't look like the pen will crack just looking at it like some other pens. I don't know if it is subject to the usual Eye Dropper burping problem, though.

The MoonMan C1 comes with a 0.6mm nib, but on Ebay you can get it with 0.38, 0.6, 0.7 and bent (Fude?) nibs for about $20. But, because it's coming from China it may take awhile since I've heard that planes, trains and boats are prevented from leaving the country because of the Coronavirus. Even buying from AMZ is no guarantee because I've ordered pens from them that were listed as being in Stock but it really meant was that they were in Stock in China. Once that happened to me I cancelled AMZ Prime...

Read all the reviews on AMZ, starting with the lowest rating to the highest. The lowest ratings are usually people who have had problems with them. For example, someone may complain that the line is too wide, even for a 0.6mm, etc. 

I would get a Nemosine Singularity if they are even still in stock. They may have a mixed cap (cap is a different colour than pen body) Singularity for $6.99.  Get the Medium. Later on you can buy a Broad or 1.1mm Stub for $15.

Other than those two, I would get a Jinhao X159. I would not get the Jinhao X450 or X750, and the X650 costs too much, now. (I don't like the barrel threads on the X450 or the Slip-Cap on the X750. ymmv.) $10.

For a really good starter pen, I'd get my favourite pen, the Faber-Castell Metallic Loom, in Broad. GoldSpot had them on sale for $30 at one time.

Medium: [https://goldspot.com/collections/faber-castell-loom/products/faber-castell-loom-metallic-orange-medium-point-fountain-pen](https://goldspot.com/collections/faber-castell-loom/products/faber-castell-loom-metallic-orange-medium-point-fountain-pen) Just that you can see the ""real"" Metallic Loom.

Your view is that you believe something is true because it can be true, even though you have no proof that it is. Yet, you ask for proof that a rodent in a market is the cause of this epidemic. Do you see how the burden of proof you place on others is much more demanding than the one you place on your conspiracy theories?

This would be like me saying I believe you are the person who actually created the virus and that you are now trying to point us all in the wrong direction to prevent the world from knowing it was really you who created the virus.

2. It's not a very effective bioweapon. The death rates are high for a coronavirus but not high for a bioweapon. And it spreads so easily that the whole world will get it. So I don't really see the use of using a coronavirus as a bioweapon. There are better options like bacterias (e.g. anthrax)"

> Kato said cases with no clear transmission chains and involving people who have not travelled to China, where the outbreak began, meant Japan was entering a new stage.

Alberta's criteria already encompasses mainland China (https://www.albertahealthservices.ca/assets/info/ppih/if-ppih-ncov-case-def.pdf). However these are just guidelines - to quote Ontario's ministry of Health: ""They are not intended to replace clinical or public health practitioner judgment in individual patient assessment and management."" (http://www.health.gov.on.ca/en/pro/programs/publichealth/coronavirus/2019_guidance.aspx) If a clinician feels that the pre-test probability of COVID19 is high, they can contact Public Health and arrange testing. Right now, 99% of reported cases are in China and <1% of patients screened have been positive in BC; expanding mass screening criteria to areas with <1% of cases is really unlikely to be of much benefit. Of course there is still debate in this area hence the variation in national and provincial screening criteria, but it's silly to compete with other countries to see who will have the most liberal screening criteria."

Recently, the Center for Health Security has received questions about whether that pandemic exercise predicted the current novel coronavirus outbreak in China. To be clear, the Center for Health Security and partners did not make a prediction during our tabletop exercise. For the scenario, we modeled a fictional coronavirus pandemic, but we explicitly stated that it was not a prediction. Instead, the exercise served to highlight preparedness and response challenges that would likely arise in a very severe pandemic. We are not now predicting that the nCoV-2019 outbreak will kill 65 million people.

After you have blanched the coronovirus, you have anti bodies in your blood that fight the virus, and getting infected in the next month is extremely difficult, but then again, if you have other diseases and your immunity is very weak, you can become infected.

Again, vaccination involves the introduction of a modified virus into you, your body produces these same antibodies. But it does not give you 100% that you will not become infected. Also, vaccination has an expiration date. It all depends on your overall health and immunity.

Read here about MERS
Also read about vaccinations and viruses, for example on Wikipedia or who.int (https://www.who.int/tb/vaccinesfaqs/en/)

>MERS-CoV may be isolated from nasal swab specimens and feces, indicating that both could be possible sources of virus transmission to humans and other animals, but virus detection rates were higher in nasal swab specimens.

There is a single study referencing SARS-CoV and blood groups, namely

*Inhibition of the interaction between the SARS-CoV Spike protein and its cellular receptor by anti-histo-blood group antibodies*  
Ref: doi:10.1093/glycob/cwn093

Quoting the paper:

>""**Epidemiological analysis of a hospital outbreak in Hong Kong revealed that blood group O was associated with a low risk of infection**.""  
>  
>Further:  
*""natural plasma anti-A specifically inhibited the SARS-CoV S protein/ACE2-dependent adhesion. This is in accordance with the hypothesis of the protective role of natural anti-HBGAs and strongly suggests that the low risk of infection of blood group O individuals during the Hong Kong hospital outbreak was due to the presence of these antibodies prior to the outbreak.""*

So, the difference in Anti-A antibodies prevalent in the blood group O inhibited th ACE-2-dependent binding proteins of SARS-CoV.

Thus, extending this reresearch finding to the new coronavirus, potentially blood group O should be less susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 ACE-2-binding."

Inovio Pharmaceuticals said that it has produced a pre-clinical vaccine to fight the deadly COVID-19 coronavirus at its lab in San Diego.

The company, based in Plymouth Meeting, Pa., used its proprietary DNA-based technology platform to design the synthetic vaccine within hours of getting the genetic sequencing of the virus.

Inovio did not respond to phone calls and emails seeking comment. But in an interview with Yahoo! Finance on Friday, Chief Executive Dr. J. Joseph Kim said that the company aims to test its vaccine in the U.S. and China as early as this summer.

“Inovio was able to move very rapidly based on our DNA medicine platform where we can design and construct our vaccine just based on the DNA sequence of the virus,” said Kim. “What we have been able to do is bring in the funding to execute the trials quickly. And we are working with different manufacturers to scale up as we need.”

There is currently no actual evidence for the ACE2 story.

First, a biorxiv pre-print should not be taken as evidence for anything, except for ""being first"" (see their large yellow banner on their website):

>bioRxiv is receiving many new papers on coronavirus 2019-nCoV.   A reminder: these are preliminary reports that have **not been peer-reviewed. They should not be regarded as conclusive**, guide clinical practice/health-related behavior, **or be reported in news media as established information**

The issues in this pre-print that I found are below:

- only having 8 patient samples, out of which only 1 was Asian (in other words: they make these claims with a **single** measurement); their dataset was originally from a study about lung transplants

- their results contradict [earlier, peer reviewed data](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15141377) (that was generated due to SARS)

- [more scientific] their signal for ACE2 is very close to the lower limit of detection, suggesting unreliable measurements for this gene; they had a very diverse sample size of different ages, sex, ethnicities and smoking status, further confounding their conclusion

TLDR: It's a single sample. It's like me rolling a dice, getting a pair of 6 and claiming that I provided evidence of having more luck than you.

Additionally, a second pre-print came out later, refuting the findings of the first, but linking ACE2 expression to smoking: https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202002.0051/v1

That pre-print has considerably more samples than the first one (224 vs 8), and disproves the first one.

In general however, you should note that pre-prints have not been peer-reviewed, should not be regarded as conclusive and not be reported in news media as established information. Please take that in consideration while choosing your news outlets."

That being said, Canada is significantly more liberal than the states and our election cycles are also much different. For ex, universal healthcare isn't a partisan issue, it's a Canadian issue that's supported by all parties. We also have multiple parties that run for government and that prevents binary polarization.

One thing I am concerned about is the increase in discrimination in our country. For ex, I've noticed a significant increase in anti-chinese sentiment over the last decade.

It appears that the situation on board the Diamond Princess provided a glance into some of the real possibilities and properties of Covid-19. The cruise ship inadvertently acted as a floating laboratory, providing some of the first solid data that wasn't from China.  Considering that we really [haven't been able to put boots on the ground in hot zones](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/07/health/cdc-coronavirus-china.html) like Wuhan to date and the [CPC has a history of altering economic data](https://www.stlouisfed.org/publications/regional-economist/second-quarter-2017/chinas-economic-data-an-accurate-reflection-or-just-smoke-and-mirrors) in it's favor, the idea that the information coming out of China may be skewed is not outside the realm of possibility. Whether cases are intentionally under-reported or simply unable to test all the cases remains to be determined. 

The Diamond Princess is a leading indicator into infection timelines, mortality rate,  r0, ability for the virus to stay alive on surfaces, and many more valuable research points. By watching and studying this incident,  we should be able to learn quite a bit about Covid-19 without having to monitor the entire population of an entire metropolitan area. The ship is effectively providing real time information into the reality of this outbreak.

# Coronavirus (COVID-19) 2020

 

Coronavirus (COVID-19) is a respiratory illness caused by a new virus. Symptoms range from a mild cough to pneumonia. Some people recover easily, others may get very sick very quickly. There is no treatment. There is evidence that it spreads from person to person. Good hygiene can prevent infection.

## What is coronavirus (COVID-19)

Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses that can make humans and animals sick. They cause illnesses that can range from the common cold to more severe diseases.

Coronavirus (COVID-19) was first reported in December 2019 in Wuhan City in China.

Other coronaviruses include [Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS)](https://www.healthdirect.gov.au/mers) and [Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS)](https://www.healthdirect.gov.au/severe-acute-respiratory-syndrome-sars).

It seems like they were supposed to go to Europe with KHN and HKH but had to change plans because of the virus outbreak. Which leads me to believe the two weren't actual replacements, it's the place that was replaced. At least that's what I understood from the explanation of the PD."

### 5. Gates Foundation Finances Pirbright Inst.

📷  Researchers from The Pirbright Institute have been awarded US $5.5  million by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation to establish a  Livestock Antibody Hub aimed at improving animal and human health  globally. The ambitious programme of work will see extensive  collaboration between multiple UK research organisations in order to  utilise research outcomes in livestock disease and immunology to support  human health as part of the ‘One Health’ agenda.  
 Six leading scientists from Pirbright will be involved in the project,  including Professor John Hammond, Professor Venugopal Nair, Dr Simon  Graham, Dr Elma Tchilian, Professor Munir Iqbal and Dr Erica Bickerton.  Their combined expert knowledge will drive the study of cattle, pig and  poultry antibody responses at high resolution to expand our  understanding of protective immunity in species that can also be used as  models for a range of human infectious diseases.  The aim is to use Pirbright’s expertise in livestock viral diseases,  cutting-edge technology and unique high-containment facilities to bring  antibody discovery, manipulation and testing up to the benchmark already  seen in the immunological field for rodents and humans. “New tools have  given us the opportunity to utilise these detailed antibody responses  to make the next generation of vaccines and therapies” said research  lead Professor Hammond.  
 This highly collaborative work will address the needs of the livestock  research community whilst bridging the requirements of the vaccine  industry. A number of work programmes will focus on studying B cells and  antibodies at multiple scales including gene expression, single cell  function and the entire antibody response.  Findings from this research will be used to drive vaccine selection and  design and test antibody therapies, “which will improve animal health  and ultimately human health, as well as ensuring the security of our  food supply”, finished Professor Hammond. Pirbright will ultimately act  as a ‘Hub’ able to provide specific methods, access to animal models and  the associated expertise to drive antibody research within the ‘One  Health’ agenda.  “This is the single biggest investment in the immunology of livestock in  the UK from an international funder, and the British Society for  Immunology will do all we can to support this collaborative initiative  and help maximise its impact for the benefit of human and animal  health”, commented Dr Doug Brown, Chief Executive of the British Society  for Immunology A major contributor to Pirbright Institute is the [Gates Foundation](https://archive.is/o/eHGBt/https://www.pirbright.ac.uk/news/2019/11/bill-melinda-gates-foundation-funds-development-pirbright%E2%80%99s-livestock-antibody-hub),  headed by Bill and Melinda Gates. Yes, those Gates. But why is that an  issue? What’s wrong with a wealthy couple contributing to help prevent  infectious diseases? Let’s  put it this way: Bill Gates has some views that are (mildly)  controversial. He has gone on record with comments that suggest be  supports human depopulation — reducing the number of people on Earth.  Could this be a way to accomplish that goal?"

if I am not mistaken the new theory is that the civet cat was not the intermediate host that caught the bat version of coronavirus that then mutated to become sars or mutated enough so that humans could catch it. i believe they are realizing that the civet cat was just an animal that could carry the disease after catching it from the actual animal in which the bat version of coronavirus mutated enough to become sars.

>Klaus Stohr, chief SARS virologist at the WHO, said Friday it was impossible  to tell from the study whether any of the animals spread the virus to humans  or whether they caught the virus from people. 

I have a feeling the whole camel and mers theory is also the same deal. the camel is just a carrier of mers and not the animal that caught the bat version of the coronavirus that mutated to become mers. 

imo all these versions of the coronavirus made the final jump between animal and man through a primate host.

> Trump winning the election

Trump has been running for years, it was only a matter of time before he finally won. As for the ""screenshots of real locations,"" those are real locations people knew he'd have visited in the process. This isn't a matter of insane foresight years in advance, it's a matter of Trump being desperate and predictable.

> the coronavirus

I know what you're talking about. The coronavirus news broadcast in the show is fake, created with doctored images by some guy using this conspiracy for more internet clout. The scene of the Chinese workers sneezing into the blender came from an episode about a fictional disease. Coronavirus is just the ""manifestation"" of a long-standing fear of the dangers of China's labor laws, you can find plenty of political satire that also ""predicts"" it.

> america’s ebola outbreak

There was no outbreak, there were a few deaths and mass hysteria, and disease outbreaks happen constantly. Remember Zika Virus?

> disney’s fox takeover

EVERY Fox show knew this would happen eventually. Disney sort of has this reputation for buying shit out constantly, basically dominating the entertainment market with an iron fist. Nobody asks _if_ they'll do it, they ask _when_ they'll do it. To summarize, Simpson's jokingly ""predicted"" this would happen, and Disney is such a piece of shit company that it actually did happen.

> and tons more

Simpson's is a show filled to the BRIM with political satire. It's the longest-running animated show in the US, having 30 seasons, two more upcoming seasons, and almost 700 episodes (there will be by the end of Season 32). With 256 hours of content (not including long episodes' extra length), you can bet they'll just accidentally guess a lot of shit right. Remember when Family Guy accidentally predicted Robin Williams' suicide? Yeah, that shit happens by accident a lot."

When I see the new BNO numbers posted every day, I am now numb to the actual numbers because I know they are not accurate. Whether its from intentionally false reporting or not, I know that not everyone who needs to be seen by a doctor is being seen just like I know that everyone who needs hospitalization is not getting it, testing kits were short for a while too and until recently china had more rigid diagnosing standards. Unless they still have empty beds waiting for new patients everyday, you cannot accurately estimate cases. People reading those numbers alone look for the tiniest of trend(death toll down one day) and just assume that that is exactly what will continue to happen. The lack of common sense hurts my brain.

What we know is it is extremely transmissible, contagious while asymptomatic, and can live on surfaces for quite a long time. I know the virus doesn't have a consciousness, but it has literally mutated into something that will live forever just like the season flu unless we get a vaccine for it and require stores at 95% of the population to take it.

Talking about globally we are going to have a rough go of it until a vaccine is created does not make me a doomer. If the US of all places struggles with just the peak of flu season every year, imagine the dynamic duo of seasonal flu and coronavirus. It's going to get ugly."

In terms of mortality, in China, it currently has a 3:1 recovery to death ratio, but in the other countries with it, it's closer to a 25:1 recovery to death ratio (ie if you get it in a country other than China, you've got about a 95% chance of recovering).  The black death had about a 1:2 recovery to death ratio (MUCH worse than the coronavirus).

In terms of infectivity, the coronavirus is actually really infective, with each new person infecting about 3.8 new people (known as the r naught value).  I'm no pathologist, so I won't speculate about how this number may change with time, but that's what it is right now. For reference the Spanish flu had an r naught of 1.8, and ended up killing 50 million (though the Spanish flu had a higher mortality rate).

And in terms of severity, it's pretty bad, with about 20% of people becoming ""severely ill"".  Since it causes pneumonia, anyone with already compromised lungs is especially vulnerable (say Chinese people with pretty severe air pollution, or smokers).

I believe they do have experts monitoring the quarantine protocol. Every risk is calculated. A wrong decision on the basis of ethical over the entire nation. The Japan government is very clear-headed on this one."

It’s a variation of a coronavirus.  The point I was trying to make is coronavirus in general is not new to humans, our understanding or science.  Coronavirus have been around in different strains for generations.  Probably thousands of years. Science is greatly experienced in dealing with them in general.  This is solvable with a vaccine and antiviral drugs which will be quickly developed.  

Coronavirus in general based on decades of knowledge “burns -out” when the weather  gets warmer.   We have tons and tons of data on dealing with this type of virus.  We are likely at or past peak infections  according to many experts.  Some others think we will hit peak shortly.  Yes there are some that think we haven’t hit peak but most leading experts think we have.  

Of course cases are vastly underreported.  That’s because most people that catch the virus think they have a common cold or mild flu and don’t seek treatment.  They might not even miss work.  They feel fine or a little “under-the-weather” and fully recovery with no ill effects and not even a visit to any healthcare.  

This is not something we need to panic about in the US or in the majority of the world.    The mortality rate is slightly higher than common flu but not so much so that it’s going to wipe out society.  

And we have our first vaccine announced tonight to go into production.

American Ingenuity.  

The CDC and US Military have  one in testing expected to be ready in 30 days for mass production. I read that last night in a reputable source but can’t remember where I found it.  I will find it and posit it as a follow up. 

Bottom line regular flu should be our worst worry."

The people are to be quarantined in 2 separate government office facilities (not hospitals or anything of the sort) in a high population density area on the city's outskirts.  Local doctors have no test kits, and almost no training on pandemic procedures and have been called some of the least prepared for situations like this in all of Asia.

 And, as of today 3 out of 4 of the suspected coronavirus patients that have been held in hospitals have literally escaped (2 Chinese patients and now a Saudi man who came from China), to the point of police searches for them.  1 other case was sent home after being partially diagnosed to rest, only to find out later it was positive (they had to send the tests to Hong Kong)."
