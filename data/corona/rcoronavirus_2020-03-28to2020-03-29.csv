source: https://bnonews.com/index.php/2020/03/the-latest-coronavirus-cases/

- Germany: 53.991 cases, 399 deaths (CFR 0,74%), 923 people in ICU, recovered people 12.250

- France: 32,964 cases 1,995 deaths (CFR 6.05%), 3,375 people in ICU, recovered: 4.948

Germany has 63% more cases than Spain but a CFR almost 10 times lower and 2500 less people in ICU.. I want to repeat it:

53.991 cases -> 399 deaths and 923 people in ICU

vs

32,964 cases -> 1,995 deaths -> 3,375 in ICU

- Luck

- Data not real

- Their race is above the other european ones, stronger and better (in term of health and immunitary system ofc)..

There is no awareness that local and state governments are who closed the schools, that Trump is suggesting that the quarantine be lifted, there's no awareness that testing is still woefully inadequate and that Trump has repeatedly lied about testing availability. 

They know Trump is giving press conferences everyday but are unaware that these are filled with misinformation.

When I went operational I got into a relationship and was beat up and assaulted and the leadership liked the guy so it was brushed under the rug. 

My NCO made remarks behind my back about my body. My trainer made comments about me sexually. I was peruses by a married officer who was intense and creepy. And I had several female friends who had been through the same or worse.

There will be third party sellers who increase prices at the moment - not least because their own supply chains are impacted - but it's a direct effort to minimise people and companies taking advantage of the current situation. For a retailer driven by algorithms (forecasting and buying is mostly automated), this represents a conscious effort to try to control the chaos, and I respect that.

There are valid things to criticise at Amazon for sure, but they have stepped up massively to ensure we can get what we need and not enable price gouging and cheating and use their position for good.

[Students of a secondary school in Guizhou suspected of food poisoning: experts are investigating the source of the disease](http://archive.is/PMOOl)

2020-03-27 15:33:42| Source: Beijing

(Original Title: Students of Guiping Jinping Secondary School Suspected of Food Poisoning, School: Expert Team Is Investigating the Source)

\[*The Beijing News*\] On the 27th, a reporter from *The Beijing News* learned from the admin staff of the Guizhou Jinping Secondary School that provincial, state, and county expert groups are investigating the source of the disease causing 209 students with symptoms such as fever and abdominal pain. School administration is still waiting for the relevant results.

*The Beijing News* previously reported that since March 24, students in the Year 12 of Jinping Middle School have experienced fever, abdominal pain, and diarrhea in varying degrees. As of 22:00 on March 26, a total of 209 students had symptoms of fever, abdominal pain and diarrhea, and 199 were hospitalized. After consultation with experts, they were suspected of acute food poisoning enteritis and acute gastroenteritis (E. coli). **After the nucleic acid test was performed on the students with fever symptoms, there was no sign of COVID-19.** The specific causes of fever, abdominal pain and diarrhea are being investigated.

On the morning of the 27th, The Beijing News reporter contacted a number of studenta involved. The students said that there was only one canteen, and a new canteen was opened this year. Year 12 students resumed classes on March 16, and are ordered to dine at school because of the pandemic. On March 24, some students developed symptoms of abdominal pain and diarrhea, and then more students became unwell.

The admin staff of the Jinping Secondary School told the Beijing News that the school handled the incident according to the standards for COVID-19. At present, the symptoms of the inpatients have disappeared. After the students return to school, the school has to be isolated for observation and classes will be delayed. Expert groups at the provincial, state, and county levels are investigating the source of the disease, and the school is still waiting. ""As a rural secondary school, our hardware has not kept up, and seasonal bacteria are growing, so we are still waiting to hear about the specific source of the disease from the provincial, state, and county government.‚Äù"

Some jobs require you to not have been convicted in the past but you have a good chance with those that don‚Äôt require it. All of this plays a role in the low rate of repeated offenders.

There's a tuition credit out now that makes a lot of families fight over who has the right, and parents will almost always win that battle because it's easy to threaten your kids."

Ê≠§Âú∞ÁÑ°ÈäÄ‰∏âÁôæÂÖ©  No 300 taels of silver are buried here

Ê≠§Âú∞ (c«ê d√¨) means this place, and ÁÑ°ÈäÄ (w√∫ y√≠n) means there is no silver. ‰∏âÁôæÂÖ©  (SƒÅn b«éi li«éng) is three hundred taels of silver. A guilty person usually would give himself away by conspicuously protesting his innocence. This idiom is used to mock someone who thinks he is clever and tries to cover things up, only to reveal what he wants to hide. It can be used to describe situations that are sarcastically self-explanatory.

&#x200B;

Literal meaning: There are not 300 taels of silver buried here

Explanation: to try to conceal sth. but give oneself away by the act

Firstly, China has \~300 million more phone subscribers than their population.  [https://techblog.comsoc.org/2020/01/23/china-has-more-than-1-6-billion-mobile-subscribers-chinas-entire-population/](https://techblog.comsoc.org/2020/01/23/china-has-more-than-1-6-billion-mobile-subscribers-chinas-entire-population/) 

So it's already clear that phone lines do not map 1:1 with population. 

Like a lot of the US, people sometimes have work and personal lines/phones, either for security reasons or just separation of work and play. Ex. in the US, a lot of small businesses use Google Voice forwarding. 

This pandemic response has been brutal for the Chinese economy as much, if not more, as it continues to be brutal to the US and world economy. A lot of small business operators in China, from restaurants to Karaoke parlors to theaters and massage parlors, have gone under or are suffering massive distress. It's not unlikely at all that many of these result in canceled wireless plans for those businesses and for those laid off from such."

Second, with an incubation period of 14 days to symptoms and a contagious period before being symptomatic we would not nessisarly know if we where shedding virus in droplets from our mouths and nose when we breath. 

In terms of hazard management there are degrees of how risk is mitigated. 

Elimination - we don't admit or treat the sick, not an option.
Substitution - not possible, not an option.
Engineering controls - we use negative pressure rooms but there are only so many of those, have erected barriers between point of entry and patients before admission to the specialized areas, reduce the number of entrances going into the hospital so that we can screen people coming in,

and a lot of people who are in bad shape think weights = getting in shape. if you go from not lifting to lifting, your first week is gonna see muscles so fucking sore you can't move, your body is literally weaker because it's focusing on repairing all that damage you did to your muscles

the first 2 weeks of ""getting in shape"" for someone who isn't in average shape at least is not a good time to get sick. 

you're not going from overweight to not overweight in 2 weeks unless you go on an all-water diet which again, weakens you

it takes time, this isn't the time to start getting healthy to fight a sickness, but maybe it's time to think about it"

There's chapter after chapter of tracking exactly what you described. Big pharma corporation wants to push a drug or big chemical wants to push an agent but neither would pass with the current FDA and EPA restrictions...so what do they do? The head of marketing quits their job with the corporation and gets a seat on the FDA / EPA board and removes the regulation or at least makes it difficult for competitors to push their products.

I bought a dozen+ copies of this book in 2006/7/8 and was just giving them away. Fascinating and infuriating information that's easy to understand. I couldn't put it down.

But back to the topic, 
WHO tweeted that they don't see issue with using ibuprofen [but the tweet had a cautious undertone](https://twitter.com/WHO/status/1240409220916432899?s=20) with the use of double negatives...

WHO is probably the most trust worthy agency right now but better safe than sorry I guess.


Stay safe.

And get a copy of that book!"

Supply vs. demand. If the supply dips or demand rises, prices increase.

You may say that they're ""taking advantage"" of consumers. This is what all people do always at all times. I would be a computer programmer for a lot less money, but they offer me a bunch so I take it. You think LeBron James would play in the NBA for $200k if that's all he could get? Of course he would.

Letting the free market operate is a much better idea than trying to control things.

In this case, a rising price sends a signal to people: ""boy, I could make a lot of money if the price of this thing has increased..."" That encourages manufacturers to ramp up production, to ship from cheaper areas to more expensive areas and for alternatives to crop up or ramp up production, as well.

Suppressing prices by law hurts the people you think you are helping. It creates shortages and removes the profit motive from the market."

It's not just the Chinese or Korean grocers, but the Indian and Ethiopian import grocers near me have all the usual products. While xenophobia might be a factor, I think local and ""ethnic"" grocery stores are a lot less subject to fluctuation. Lots of these places are mainly serving neighborhood foot traffic more than cars, so their customers are less likely to do big stock-ups. People panicking who don't usually shop there are more likely to go to a chain grocery store than a store where they don't recognize many products. And at any time these stores often have really great selections of non-perishable goods, even compared to the big chain supermarkets, because between a lot of their product having to make it across the world to get there and their customer base being lower, they've always prioritized stocking things that don't spoil."

Grocery store workers go on strike all the time. Customers go to other chains, and the workers end up going back to work almost immediately.

If everyone left they'd hire new high school kids and drop outs. In my experience most part timers usually are fairly replaceable, I was, despite good relationships with management and other employees plus a year of good work. In my experience only 1/5 managers is good, i.e knows what they're doing sales wise and is good to employees. Nearly all people in a grocery store simply get where they are by putting in the time and not being particularly offensive. The fact is, they (the employees) are not valuble at all as an asset in general. 

Part time work is part time work and you will never see that change. It just isn't feasible to manage an economy where the work that literally *anyone* can do is valued highly. Because it ain't valuble. I worked in a grocery store making $12.50 usd an hour which alot for the U.S. in a super market. We had a rival store strike, we got maybe a 30% increase in daily customers, which made it very busy, but it lasted maybe a week. The strike was over, but people talked about being harassed at the picket lines at that cost them business long term. Either way it doesn't matter. Supermarket workers are usually high school kids and dropouts, people who didn't get a college education, or if they did, they aren't using it. I know, I worked in one in a well to do neighborhood. We were and are totally replaceable. It doesn't matter."
