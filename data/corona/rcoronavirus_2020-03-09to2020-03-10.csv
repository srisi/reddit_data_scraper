It doesn’t matter ultimately because they don’t have any tests to test with anyways. They haven’t had a single test given to them..


I REPEAT NONE OF THE PRIMARY CARE PHYSICIANS ARE GETTING ACCESS TO TESTS BECAUSE THERE ARE NO TESTS.

They are only testing if you meet a VERY VERY stringent symptom display and then you have to be hospitalized for them to test as well. 

It’s absofuckinglutelt moronic and you can 100% blame this on the trump administration for being worried about god damn optics instead of the well being of the citizens of this country.

Republicans, honestly you people have to wake the hell up and start contacting your local congresspersons. We need people capable of running the CDC put back in place after the administration gutted funding by 90%. Your congresspersons with enough pressure will get the message and force trump to act like a big boy. They’ve done it a few times when it’s been beneficial for them. This is one of those times when it’s beneficial for them.

Edit: to be clear - the amount of Coronavirus cases in America is far far higher than we are being told. If primary care physicians had been given access to a working test months ago we could have been far ahead of this. This is absolute and total mismanagement by this administration."

Thinking I had symptoms, I got a disturbing glimpse of the city’s chaotic and self-contradictory approach to containing the virus.
By Robin Shulman
Ms. Shulman is a freelance journalist.
March 9, 2020



Credit...Victor J. Blue for The New York Times
Two weeks ago, I flew from La Guardia Airport to Toronto for a 24-hour trip.
In the immigration intake area, at least 100 passengers streamed off a flight from Shanghai, where the coronavirus had been found a month earlier. We all pressed our fingers on touch screens to answer immigration questions and waited for about 15 minutes for masked, gloved agents to examine each passport.

The next day, I flew back.

That fleeting contact with people arriving from a country at the epicenter of the coronavirus outbreak — and the knowledge that people were probably arriving at the airport from every other outbreak spot as well — rattled me enough that when I developed respiratory symptoms several days after I got home, I was more insistent in seeking health care than I might have been otherwise.

Maybe I was overcautious, but the experience gave me a disturbing glimpse of New York City’s chaotic and self-contradictory approach to containing the virus.

I first developed a cough. Soon, I also noticed that I was losing my breath just walking a few blocks. I didn’t want to overreact — the most logical explanation was a simple chest cold.

Just in case, I went to my primary care practice — I have an immune disorder that could make me more susceptible to illness, and with two young children in school, I wanted to make sure my family didn’t spread something pernicious.
When I said I wondered if I had the coronavirus, the nurse told me I should have gone straight to the hospital. But she didn’t seem overly concerned, and didn’t put on a mask or gloves. I felt relieved when she listened through her stethoscope and said she heard no sign of lung infection.

A few days later, I developed a fever, gastrointestinal symptoms, and tremors in my hands. On Google I learned that two people who were later diagnosed with coronavirus had landed at the Toronto airport on the same days as I passed through, Feb. 20 and 21. One person arrived from China and the other from Iran.
Meanwhile, Covid-19 was being diagnosed in the United States in people who had not traveled abroad recently or been in contact with anyone who had.
There must have been many people in New York City like me with symptoms consistent with the coronavirus, wondering: Should I take precautions, to protect other people? Should I avoid panic and just proceed. 

Last Tuesday, after a night fever of 100.8, I called the new New York State coronavirus hotline. I was told to go to the hospital for a test. I called ahead to the emergency room of Mount Sinai Hospital on Madison Avenue in Manhattan.

At the emergency room, I was dispatched to a private room. Two staff people entered wearing masks and gloves.

But the attending doctor came in without a mask and offered his bare hand for a shake. He assured me that I was low-risk because I hadn’t been to an epidemic country like Italy, South Korea, or China. The hospital would not test me, since I did not meet the hospital’s criterion for testing, travel to one of those countries, he said. He advised me to go home and continue life as normal. If I felt sick, stay home, and if I felt well, go out. I should only come to the hospital if I felt sick enough to need hospitalization. And my children and husband should continue to go to school and work as usual.

That did not seem like a good way to contain an epidemic.

Still, I felt some relief — a doctor had told me I did not have the virus and therefore could stop fretting about transmission and start nursing my illness.

That relief dissipated that evening when my 6-year-old son began sobbing at bedtime. He looked flushed. He had a fever of 99.6. And because I had been sick that day, my 76-year-old mother, who has respiratory problems, had taken my son to an appointment.

I felt scared, guilty, and enormously frustrated that I didn’t know what it was I was potentially transmitting."

### ""Italy is also testing post-mortem on Corona 

 In Italy, it is certain, that the largest number of people have been  tested for the corona virus in Europe - and since the first Covid 19  disease appeared on February 20, post-mortem tests have also been  carried out.  An analysis of the first 104 deaths showed that more than [two thirds of the deceased examined had](https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&rurl=translate.google.com&sl=auto&sp=nmt4&tl=en&u=https://www.tagesspiegel.de/wissen/italien-kaempft-gegen-coronavirus-so-leben-die-menschen-in-der-roten-zone/25621354.html&usg=ALkJrhjzAphRxFmslCxhISUWHrwtxjn2tQ) at least two more or less life-threatening previous illnesses. 

 Many of them would not have lived long without being infected by the  virus - or they would probably have survived the virus infection if it  had not been seriously ill and their immune system had been weakened.  These deaths are also counted in the Italian case statistics.  In other countries, they would not have been tested for the corona virus at all. """

So two weeks ago my girlfriend and I presented to urgent care with severe flu-like symptoms, body aches, coughing, high fever, etc. we were given rapid tests which tested negative. To confirm it wasn’t pneumonia, we were given chest x-day’s which came back normal. We were given tamiflu and sent on our way. We greatly improved and last week we were even back in the gym.

Last night my girlfriend spiked a 103 fever and I was bouncing between 99 and 101. We both had extreme body aches and flu-like symptoms. I even had some bad diarrhea. I went to my psychiatrist this morning and almost immediately was shuffled off to urgent care for worries of COVID-19. I wrote I was referred for COVID like symptoms and was triaged ahead of a waiting room of 25 patients. The nurses came in wearing full protective gear, which was great. 

The doctor comes in and immediately asks how I had contact with COVID. I said I didn’t. My professor’s husband had direct contact but that’s it. She immediately removed all of her protective gear and told me to take off my mask. After another negative flu test, this incompetent doctor simply said I have a sinus infection and to take antibiotics, she sent me home.

More worrisome is that the clinic had 9 exam rooms and 5 were on 2-hr quarantined after seeing suspected COVID patients. I wish I had been taken more seriously, but because the CDC and Dept. of Health only test people with level 2 or 3 exposure, I was sent back onto the streets. She even told me to go back to classes.

This is becoming ridiculous."

What that means mathematically is it took an average of 2.5 infected person to have 1 infected person in the next generation, with each new generation arising in average 6.3 days.

What it means in real life is there are many many people who after becoming infected, never infected anyone else before recovering or dying, thus they became dead ends for the virus."

Here's my tips or what worked for me to help you get through it. For reference, 27 years old woman, prior clean bill of health (ironically did some complete blood panels + lung radios about a month ago, the radiologist even said I had ''pretty lungs'' and praised their good health).   
what will help you :   
\- lots of fluids  
\- a lot of sleep  
\- antibacterial throat lozenges taken regularly  
\- dry cough syrup before bed time (Very important as most coughing fits will begin at night time, it happened to both me and my boyfriend)   
\- cold and flu paracetamol (as opposed to ibuprofen, less stomach damage in long run)  
\- regular paracetamol to alternate with cold and flu so as to minimize intake   
\- honey to pour down your throat as needed, in between cough syrup intake  
\- vitamin c 1000mg tablet to keep immune system boosted  
\- full multivitamin and mineral complex tablet from the brand Sentry  


So far, what has been notable in terms of symptom. Night 1, it began with a tickly throat sensation, that turned into soreness. The next few days were somewhat easy to handle, with just a slight headache, fever to manage and sore throat, with a bit of phlegm to clear (softly). Night 4 I started to have a coughing fit at night. It was a very dry cough, the kind that makes you burst out coughing because you felt an irresistible tickling in your throat. I eventually took some cough syrup and it subsided. Use that information, it's very important to act proactively. The next few days till today I was on top of the night coughing fits, and the days are just tired and a bit feverish, that is all. I am thinking I am about 80% done with the disease. As I've said it's been fairly nice on me, apart from the coughing fit which took me off guard on the fourth night, which I managed quickly. I am sure if I didn't have all the medicines and ingredients available at home (thank god for my prepper ass) I would have had a much harder, and complicated time with it.   


I am very lucky to have experienced it mildly, my boyfriend almost couldn't breathe because he suffers from asthma and was prescribed a ventolin puffer and antibiotics as well, because it reached his lungs. The antibiotics did not seem to help at all, he eventually recovered on his own after two weeks. I do not feel any lung congestion, I simply have to clear my throat for about fifteen minutes in the morning from accumulated phlegm, but no significant amount that would suggest lung inflammation."

Impact of the epidemic in the US

Now that new COVID-19 cases are being detected in the U.S. every day, it is too late to stop the initial wave of infections. The epidemic is likely to spread across the U.S. The virus appears to be about as contagious as influenza. But this comparison is difficult to make since we have no immunity to the new coronavirus.

On balance, it is reasonable to guess that COVID-19 will infect as many Americans over the next year as influenza does in a typical winter – somewhere between 25 million and 115 million. Maybe a bit more if the virus turns out to be more contagious than we thought. Maybe a bit less if we put restrictions in place that minimize our travel and our social and professional contacts.

The bad news is, of course, that these infection numbers translate to 350,000 to 660,000 people dying in the U.S., with an uncertainty range that goes from 50,000 deaths to 5 million deaths. The good news is that this is not a weather forecast. The size of the epidemic, i.e., the total number of infections, is something we can reduce if we decrease our contact patterns and improve our hygiene. If the total number of infections decreases, the total number of deaths will also decrease."

When Italy was at 500, they were still testing the asymtomatics too, and they were actually tracking people down. 75% of the people were asymptomatic, which is absolutely not the case in the US. The US now is like when Italy had 2000 cases or something like that. It's going to scale massively anytime soon, and people will realize it too late (because if they haven't realized now, they won't realize it in 5 days)"

My big take-away from reading the new CDC website is that the first cases in the USA were mid January. That also corresponds to [google searches of people looking up the hospital billing codes for coronavirus](https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=today%203-m&geo=US&q=coronavirus%20icd10).

We should be long past the ""we're making plans to make plans"" stage."
