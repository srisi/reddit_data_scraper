> Abolghasem’s Basij Forces took active part in crushing anti-regime protests. Over 1,500 Iranians were killed by the pro-regime forces during the clampdown.

However current statistics are showing that COVID-19's fatality rate is higher than the flu. Typically the flu fatality rate is [less than 0.1%](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Influenza#Pandemics). COVID-19 currently has a fatality rate of around [3%](https://experience.arcgis.com/experience/685d0ace521648f8a5beeeee1b9125cd).

Anyway it turned out there has been an rtPCR sitting unused in the geneticist’s closed lab since he died, so our dept. is sending that out on loan asap (the request came in yesterday & I think the state picked it up today).

The healthcare system is ridiculously well-funded. we can run up to 12000 coronavirus tests per day as of today, but so far the number of samples to be tested is much much less than the capacity. Germany actually provides the WHO test kits for the world at least the recipes, which the USA refused to use. Most cases so far, from what I am aware of, are also in the business community rather than the elderly community. more than 60% of Germans live their lives in small villages and commute to work so spread is lower. The biggest city in the country of 80mil has only 3.5mil people and 15 cases.

I pay 270eu per month for public healthcare on a salary that is way above average, and I saw a doctor this week without an appointment within 20minutes. On the door, there was a sign warning not to enter if you suspect you have Covid. The receptionist told me not to go to the waiting room and instead go wait outside in a park and wait for a phone call - reducing the risk that someone might spread the disease in a waiting room. 

Thats why germany has succeeded, so far at least.

2020-03-07,DocKoul,Coronavirus,52,https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/ff0jju/the_italian_society_of_anesthesia_resuscitation/fjuoz5n/,"I work as an intensive care specialist. This is a difficult situation and I’ll try to explain the thought process here. I doubt this will be limited to Italy as this progresses. 

Firstly, please understand intensive care is a limited resource - rooms, ventilators and staff are key. We can’t easily create these.

Secondly, a young person and an elderly person have VERY different trajectories once they become critically ill. Below is a generalisation, but fairly common scenario

A young person (let’s say 30-55 years) with very few medical issues becomes critically unwell and is put into an induced coma to overcome this illness. They are ventilated for a week, the endotracheal tube (breathing tube) is removed and they go to the ward for a few days to a week and make it home. This may be more or less complicated depending on complications. Staff/room/ventilator use is roughly a week. 

An elderly person (over 70- 75) with a few medical issues becomes critically ill and is put into an induced coma the same as above. Their heart doesn’t pump so well, so they end up with extra medication to support their blood pressure. They also are more likely to develop an arrhythmia (abnormal heart rhythm) and due to a heart working hard they have a small heart attack. Their kidneys don’t get the same blood flow (they don’t as well on a normal day due to age) causing fluid retention and make their lungs soggy making it harder to remove the ventilator. Their lungs don’t work overly well due to exposure to second hand smoke and just simply age related change. The medications to keep them sleeping for the ventilator cause hallucinations and delerium when they wake up. They have a lower amount of muscle than the young person and quickly waste away and become very weak in the space of a week. Two weeks on the breathing machine go by and there is a decision to do a tracheostomy (breathing tube for the neck) so they can be awake and still have the support of the ventilator. The reason they need this is because their lungs are still soggy and wet with fluid, they are too weak to breathe on their own and can’t even stand under their own power. They can’t cough well and get bacterial pneumonia on top of their viral pneumonia. They remain for another week. They finally get to the ward after nearly a month in the intensive care and into the ward. However they never recover enough to be independent and go to a nursing home. There are multiple variations here (strokes, heart failure, dialysis, pressure sores, other infections... the list is massive)

Those of us in the intensive care community are faced with this decision every day. It is our duty to protect and appropriately allocate this resource. During normal operation, if a relatively healthy 80 year old gets pneumonia and needs the support, we would admit and submit them to the treatment/torture of intensive with a hope of a good outcome (home and independent). We cannot admit hundreds of 70-80+ year olds to a tertiary hospitals with coronavirus and ventilate them for 2-3 weeks when there are hundreds of younger healthy people who need the resource. It’s an unpopular decision but it’s a medical decision. Not a government decision, not a patient decision, not a family decision (but we absolutely take all those opinions into account when making the decision). 

It is vital that the general community understands this. There is a HUGE difference between admitting a young person vs an elderly person with the same illness. 

Knowing what you know now, who would you admit to your last three ICU beds with the last three ventilators? How would you explain it to the six patients and their families?"

All of the following info comes from there. 

It says that most people have flu-like symptoms 6-7 days after infection: sore throat, fever, cough, muscle aches. Most people have about a week of misery then get better. 

Some people don’t get better after a week, instead get worse. Worse means that the cough gets worse and patients have increasing shortness of breath. 80% are fine at home, but an estimated 20% need hospital care. It’s unclear if that is a percentage of the people who are infected or a percentage of those who don’t get better after a week. 

I think the reason symptoms and other details are not talked about much is because there is a worry that doctors/healthcare facilities will be overwhelmed by patients who have a cold or the flu who don’t need intervention and would be better off at home."

If they can black-out the press and knowledge of the spread and everyone goes about their daily business it won’t affect the economy that badly. Instead of a national crisis, it just becomes a personal tragedy that grandpa and grandma died from coronavirus.

The problem that they are overlooking is that hospitalization rates don’t lie. Hospitals will be overrun with patients. And people that should have survived with proper care will die. The amount of sick people and fear will still damage the economy. They are leaving this to a “miracle”. Hoping that it will burn out or somehow not impact the US as badly as other countries."

IDK, this seems like exactly the situation you'd want to avoid if you're worried about the coronavirus.  You want your child at a daycare with other children and multiple other careworkers who could have been exposed instead of with your MIL who is more likely to keep herself isolated if you request it if it means she can spend time with her grandkid?  Even you going back to work increases the chances of your child getting sick!  Do you work in complete isolation or do you have interactions with coworkers or clients?

*Lawler's estimates include:*

*4.8 million hospitalizations associated with the novel coronavirus*

*96 million cases overall in the US*

*480,000 deaths*

*Overall, the slide points out that hospitals should prepare for an impact to the system that's 10 times a severe flu season.*

look at China, Iran, Italy and ask yourself if this country can quarantine effectively at all?  We have cruise ships stuck outside the coast of california, docks empty, and ""just in time"" supply chains never tested in this environment before as global infection is only 100k (known).  where will it be in four weeks when we are in millions infected?

>  
>The epicenter of cases in New York continued to be just north of the city, in Westchester County, where there were 57 in total, the governor said. These cases were mostly, if not all, related to a cluster in Westchester that first came to the authorities’ attention [after a New Rochelle resident, a 50-year-old lawyer, was confirmed as New York’s second coronavirus patient](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/04/nyregion/new-rochelle-coronavirus.html).  
>  
>But there were also signs of wider spread, including a pair of cases in Saratoga County, north of the state capital of Albany — the first such confirmed cases outside of the New York City region.  
>  
>The declaration of emergency will allow the state to speed up the purchasing of supplies and the hiring of workers to assist local health departments that have been handling the monitoring of thousands of self-quarantined patients, Mr. Cuomo said.  
>  
>“Somebody has to go knock on their door, once a day,” he said during a midday briefing in the state Capitol. “This is labor intensive.”  
>  
>The declaration would also allow officials to skirt purchasing regulations, if necessary, he said.  
>  
>New accounts of infection continued to emerge. On Friday night, the driver in Queens tested positive, and the discovery of the case prompted more than 40 doctors, nurses and other workers at a hospital there to go into self-quarantine over fears that they might have been exposed to the coronavirus, officials said on Saturday.  
>  
>The man, 33, walked into St. John’s Episcopal Hospital in the Far Rockaway section of Queens on Tuesday and reported flulike symptoms. He went home and returned later when his symptoms worsened, an official said.  
>  
>Dozens of workers at the hospital are now being tested, officials said.  
>  
>“Obviously, 40 people are out,” said Councilman Donovan Richards Jr., a Democrat who represents Far Rockaway. “The hospital will need to replace those people temporarily. They will need money to do that. They need supplies. We need to keep the health care up and running.”  
>  
>Tom Melillo, a hospital spokesman, said that the patient remained in quarantine at the hospital on Saturday, and that hospital officials were monitoring everyone who may have been exposed to the patient.  
>  
>It was not immediately clear whether the man drives a yellow taxi or works for ride-hailing services like Uber or Lyft. Representatives with Uber, Lyft and the New York City Taxi and Limousine Commission all said that officials had not reported that one of their drivers had tested positive for the virus.  
>  
>Health officials said they were also seeking to determine whether the driver may have exposed passengers.

>  
>Mr. Cuomo did not say on Saturday how many New Yorkers were now isolating themselves at home over fears they might have been exposed to the virus. But as of Friday, New York officials said they had asked about 4,000 people in the state to self-quarantine.  
>  
>About 2,700 of that quarantined group were in New York City, and most of them had recently returned from five countries where the outbreak has been most severe: China, Iran, Italy, Japan and South Korea.

>  
>In his remarks on Saturday, Mr. Cuomo said the state was aggressively testing as many people as possible. “We want to find positives,” the governor said, adding that while some people might be disconcerted by the rising number of patients, it showed that the solid medical detective work was underway. “We say, ‘That’s good news, that we know who the people are.”  
>  
>New Jersey officials said on Friday that four people in the state had tested positive for the virus: a 32-year-old man, a man in his 50s and a woman in her 30s, all from Bergen County near New York; and a man in his 60s from Camden County, in the southern part of the state.

This is the special print I did specially for those who joined [my # album group order!](https://www.reddit.com/r/LOONA/comments/espz79/hello_im_kikistiel_and_im_running_my_third_loona/) You guys who joined helped me get in to every fansign Loona had this comeback, and you were all so patient with the delays caused by the coronavirus outbreak! I'm sad that promotions were cut a bit short for Loona this comeback, but they were great while they lasted and I'm still rooting for Loona from the safety of my home these days :) Thank you again SO much to those who joined!

I worked extra hard on this print, and there's lots of small little details in this thing. I think I spent around 15-16 hours on this? I wanted to showcase each member's parts in the MV, combining the sets of ""twins"" (Go Won & Chuu, Choerry & Hyunjin).

The big picture: A truly global infectious disease event like COVID-19 can be every bit as transformative for the future as a global war or economic depression.

The impacts of major pandemics can be felt well beyond the sheer death toll.

* The Black Death, which killed as much as a third of Europe's population during the 14th century, led to severe labor scarcity. The resulting higher wages helped erode feudalism and encouraged the innovation of labor-saving technologies.

* More recently the 2003 SARS outbreak helped jumpstart China's nascent e-commerce sector.

What to watch: How lasting the changes created by COVID-19 will be depends on the extent of the virus's spread and its ultimate severity, neither of which can be known yet. But the longer the outbreak endures, the more likely it is that coping responses will remain with us.

/ 1. **Going remote**: Videoconferencing and remote work have exploded as the virus has spread.

* According to Kentik, a global provider of network analytics, videoconferencing traffic in North America and Asia has doubled since the outbreak began.

* Led by tech firms like Twitter and Facebook, companies are encouraging and even requiring their employees to work from home, both to slow the spread of the disease now and prepare for the worst should offices be closed in a quarantine.

* Many experts believe business leaders will come to see that central offices and face-to-face meetings are less vital than they thought. ""We're going to see that work can be tied to productivity anywhere rather than putting time in an office,"" said Peter Jackson, CEO of the digital collaboration company Bluescape.

/ 2. **The big decoupling**: After the travel industry, the companies that have suffered most from COVID-19 are those with just-in-time supply chains highly dependent on China.

* As a result, the coronavirus has already ""prompted a re-examination of the world's central reliance on China as ground zero for manufacturing,"" as Peter Goodman wrote in the New York Times.

* If the outbreak worsens, ""we'll definitely see accelerated decoupling of manufacturing out of China,"" said Ian Bremmer, president of Eurasia Group. ""Changes that may have been delayed until the next recession will happen right now.""

/ 3. **Nastier politics**: The ideal reaction to a global outbreak would be a globally unified response. Don't bet on it.

* Far-right leaders in countries like France, Italy and Spain have already taken advantage of the outbreak to call for tightening borders. As a result, wrote Pawell Zerka of the European Council on Foreign Relations, ""populism could flourish as the coronavirus spreads.""

* COVID-19 has already become politicized in the U.S. According to one online survey, nearly 70% of Republicans believe the nation is prepared for the outbreak, compared to just 35% of Democrats.

* While China badly mismanaged the start of the outbreak, more recently the country has tried to spin its apparent success in containing the virus as a triumph of its autocratic system. Expect that argument to gain force if the U.S. bungles its response.

/ 4. **Faster science**: While governments have struggled to respond to COVID-19, scientists are making the most of new tools to track and potentially counter the virus.

* Rapid analyses of the genetic makeup of the virus in Washington state indicated the outbreak there was likely underway well before the first official cases were confirmed in late January.

* Scientists at Stanford University developed a diagnostic test for the novel coronavirus that can deliver tests in as little as 12 hours, much faster than current models.

The bottom line: The year is less than three months old, but we have every reason to believe that COVID-19 will be one of the most significant events of the decade — if not beyond."

If UCSB is determined that the campus will remain open, then what could happen when confirmed cases start to popping out in Santa Barbara or among the students/staff? There will be MUCH MORE cases following since the Coronavirus has a relatively long incubation period (7\~ 24 days)and can spread around even when the patient shows no or mild symptoms.

2020-03-07,ajgorak,australia,30,https://www.reddit.com/r/australia/comments/ff1s6o/inaccuracies_and_unfairness_infected_gp_demands/fjvgc6g/,"> Fortunately/unfortunately this virus will likely bring to the foreground what the medical industry has been saying for years, there is chronic workforce shortages to the point where medical units would not function if staff took sick leave. 

I asked my ambulance service's leadership team to issue advice to staff that they need to stay away from work if they're unwell. HR's response was we would have no ambulance service if we did that. Essentially tacit acknowledgement that we are reliant on staff who shouldn't be at work to provide our core business. There is no fat in the health system to absorb vacancies. The initial response seems to be about working the existing staff harder (recalls to work, cancellation of annual leave) and not about bolstering the workforce. That path leads only to resentment and burnout.

This isn't just a coronavirus thing, although it's certainly uncovering a lot of poor practices. All workers in the health field work with vulnerable populations at all times. A mild illness can still kill an immunocompromised patient, and unfortunately we don't get to pick and choose which patients we see. I take sick leave when unwell for that reason -  I don't want to be the cause of someone else's illness.

The problem being, of course, that at that point we're accessing sick leave for the protection of potential patients, and NOT because we're necessarily unable to work. I can work through a runny nose, it's just irritating. Many are hesitant to access that sick leave in that context, because they a) might need it in the future if incapacitated and b) their carer's leave is generally the same balance and they may need to take time off work to care for a loved one.

That all boils down to the hypocrisy the doctors are pointing out here. Medical staff are not empowered to take the time off work it is being suggesting they should have. Sick leave balances are insufficient for staff dealing primarily with unwell people to be able to take that time off each time they become unwell, and there's a feeling of ""letting the team down"" when you do take that time off.

Whether someone feels that it is reasonable to still attend work while unwell with the potential of passing on that illness to someone else within that context is really going to be an individual thing. I can't help but feel a bad practice has been normalised because of the limits of the health system."

NEW YORK (AP) — The White House overruled health officials who wanted to recommend that elderly and physically fragile Americans be advised not to fly on commercial airlines because of the new coronavirus, a federal official told The Associated Press. 

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention submitted the plan this week as a way of trying to control the virus, but White House officials ordered the air travel recommendation be removed, said the official who had direct knowledge of the plan. Trump administration officials have since suggested certain people should consider not traveling, but they have stopped short of the stronger guidance sought by the CDC."

> Now almost every public building in Taipei offers hand sanitizer and a lot of them, such as schools, require that anyone entering submit to a fever check.

The actual problem is that there isn't anywhere near enough gear in US hospitals, so hospitals are rationing this gear in a way that's making it very hard to actually protect yourself when you're going to see a patient who may or may not have it. And the lack of any way to actually test for it makes this even more problematic.

Our testing abilities should be getting MUCH better this week, I'm not sure what the timeline is to actually get protective equipment into everyone's hands though-all the hospitals have ordered millions of dollars of PPE but who knows how long it'll take.

> ""hospitals will be overwhelmed""

Yes, yes we fucking will. Especially in the USA, where the CDC has (and continues to) pushed obtuse testing protocols which make it difficult to get a test ordered. We are discharging people home with mild COVID cases who are undiagnosed, free to infect multitudes. 

> They simply push patients who are most critical to these wings to provide them with the best care (and most expensive, of course) so should the beer flu hopitalize a lot of people, they'll simply create more space and move non critical people out for the duration needed.

Space is not created. Beds and resources are *very much* finite. My facility serves 80,000 people. Know how many ventilators we have? 24. **Twenty four**. [COVID has a 17% chance of Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) with 47% chance of requiring mechanical ventilation past that point.](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/clinical-guidance-management-patients.html) So, with some basic math, we know that my ER will be completely overwhelmed with 400 community infections. That is ~~.05%~~0.5% of our patient population. Not 5%, but **half of one percent**. Tranfers are not a guarantee -- when another facility is also overwhelmed by their populations, they will not accept our patients. There will be systemic overload, even with the minimum statistics released by the CDC.

> But lets pretend that the hospitals will be overwhelmed. Who dies from this, again? The extremely old. So that's where the death rate will tick up anyway.

When we have no ventilators, everyone who needs one for any reason dies. Pediatric asthma cases, CHF, anaphylaxis, stroke, etc. When our nurses and doctors are required to self-quarantine for 14 days, we are short staffed and patient outcomes decline. It's numbers."

I don't have a car and I live downtown. I can expense Lyft.

I pretty regular take a morning flight down and hop on one home around 7pm. I usually leave my apartment at ~830 and get home at ~830-9 and get almost a full day in PDX (11-5 or so to get work done). If I need a full 9-5 I'll take an earlier flight.

The nice thing about that flight is that it's super super easy to take. It takes me 15 minute Lyft to the airport and I show up 10-15 minutes before boarding. CLEAR + TSA means that there are never lines to wait for, and since I'm going same-day I just bring my day pack with my computer in it. If I miss my flight, oh well it's easy to catch the next one. But with Clear I've never missed. Flights are as cheap as 20 bucks one way right now with the Coronavirus situation. 

I find that I generally spend less time in travel when I fly to PDX rather than drive. Usually it takes ~4h with traffic one way driving. And if you have a credit card that offers priority pass, you can get free booze in the lounges. So for me, I don't have to drive 7-8 hours and pay attention to driving. I can have a beer on my way home and grab a snack if I have any time before my flight. 

If I had a car and was going for a weekend, I'd just drive. But there are cases where it can make sense to fly to PDX, and it works well for popping down there on a Tuesday."

>**Psychological preparation is important too**  
Pandemics are scary. The spread of the coronavirus within the US could be a significant disruption to many people’s lives, a health crisis for some smaller number of people, and a deadly tragedy for a still-smaller number.  
>  
>“It helps to be a little psychologically prepared for the possibility that life will be very different for a period of time,” Lipsitch told me. Processing that possibility now can help us “get over the surprise of that, to some extent, before it happens.” So coronavirus paranoia, if you’re experiencing some, isn’t silly or unreasonable — it’s part of the totally normal process of coming to grips with a significant problem.  
>  
>“The ‘adjustment reaction’” — that is, the stress, hypervigilance, obsessive reading about a crisis, imagining its effects on your family, and worrying — “is a step that is hard to skip on the way to the new normal,” Lanard and Sandman write. “Going through it before a crisis is full-blown is more conducive to resilience, coping, and rational response than going through it mid-crisis.”  
>  
>So be forgiving of yourself if you’re having an “adjustment reaction” or if your friends and loved ones are. The spread of the coronavirus will be genuinely disruptive, difficult, and for some people dangerous. Taking real steps to mitigate the effects it will have on you or your family isn’t a silly thing to do — it’s a responsible one.

That the anti China party - the DPP - won in a total landslide and record breaking voter turnout?

If you mean the 2018 local elections, that was due to a massively unpopular (but since seen as necessary) pension reform that was going to become insolvent mere months before the bill passed. Since then, Xi Jinping has ramped up the anti-Taiwan propaganda and been openly hostile such as the near total ban on Chinese tourists to Taiwan in an attempt to ruin the economy of the country - a factor which definitely helped stop the early spread of Coronavirus.

The public discourse has changed significantly since then, since China's hostility has dominated politics since the Hong Kong riots began. People are very aware now of China's attempts at breaking the democracy from within, and recent laws like the [Anti-Infiltration Bill](https://thediplomat.com/2020/01/taiwan-passes-anti-infiltration-act-ahead-of-election-amid-opposition-protests/) to keep foreign money and influence out of politics and the record breaking victory for the DPP demonstrate that we aren't gonna let that shit slide."

Nobody is hiding anything. We’re just not testing nearly as much here as we probably should. 

The upside to all of this is that in places where testing has occurred the CFR seems much lower. Take ROK for instance, where they’re doing testing en masse and the CFR is therefore 0.6%. I doubt that ROK has any other circumstances that make it any less risky for people (plus they have lots of elderly and smokers which should increase risk) but once the known case denominator grows the actual CFR drops. That’s heartening. 

But the US has a bizarre culture of efficiency for the sake of it so we just don’t know.

2020-03-07,Starcraftduder,investing,21,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/fexlqx/the_coronavirus_is_vastly_under_appreciated/fjt4ccx/,"I'd like to add on to your post with something I posted on another thread:

A month ago I posted a thread making the argument that the global economy would enter a serious downturn unless two things happened: 1) a treatment for the new coronavirus was developed immediately 2) a vaccine is developed by the next flu season

https://www.reddit.com/r/China_Flu/comments/f1fm6y/the_world_economy_will_enter_a_serious_downturn/

The reasoning hinged on whether the characteristics of the virus was dangerous enough to change the behavior of economic actors. We've had past scares like H1N1 or ebola that didn't have any major impact. But my it seemed clear that the characteristics of this new virus was disruptive and dangerous enough to seriously affect the behavior of economic actors and thus negatively impact the economy as a whole. Here's some highlights of what was discussed:

>This is why I said for nCoV to ""blow over"", an affordable treatment needs to be developed pretty much right now. Think about it, who would unnecessarily risk a trip to the movies or take a vacation with the risk of a catching HIGHLY infectious disease that spreads in many ways and spreads asymptomatically and can outright KILL you at up to a 25% probability without hospitalization?

>**Affordable and effective treatment SOON and vaccines before the next flu seasons are crucial to avoiding lasting economic decline**

>But why would there be economic decline? Well, because people will change their behavior as long as the threat of the virus remains. Let's look at what industries will be affected:

- All tourism industry related businesses in Asia will take a huge hit. I'm talking about airlines, hotels, tours, restaurants, tourist destinations, markets, etc.

- Reports already show that business declined by as much as 80% in some tourism driven markets in Thailand. Overall air traffic in China has shrunk from over 17,000 daily flights to 5,000. Hotels, cruises, flights are getting canceled left and right.

- **Many businesses that run on tight margins and those with complex supply chains and a Just-in-Time manufacturing strategy will be seriously hit by this and may even have to file for bankruptcy.** Let's take something like restaurants into consideration. The ones who specialize in deliveries may actually thrive in this market but most restaurants that depend on foot traffic or has high markups and depend on ambience to attract customers will suffer or shutter. They have to keep paying expensive rent and other overhead costs while customers may take months to slowly return. 

- **Expect a lot of businesses to start massive layoffs.** Vulnerable Asian airlines will be first. Many airlines like China Airline are already halting recruiting new flight attendants. Others like Cathay Pacific which has negative operating cash flow are asking their crew to take up to month long unpaid leave. They are canceling up to 50% of their flights stretching into at least march. How can they possibly remove the threat of this virus if no treatment/vaccine has been developed? The reason they are shutting down flights will therefore persist, and they will suffer a prolonged period of diminished business.

- **America and the West will also feel the reverberations of China's hard fall.** The ways that the West's economy is tied to China's is too much to even try to list. But just understand that the biggest growth of profit over the last 20 years for many of the largest companies have come from China's consumer class. If that consumer class is not buying stuff, stocks will tank. Companies that spent the last 10 years using cheap debt to finance growth may go into bankruptcy when they are faced from such a drastic and sudden dip in their business. Expect all the weak poorly run businesses to get shaken up and many of them failing in the coming months. 

- There will be a feedback loop. There are many industries we can FOR SURE predict big problems for in 2020. We are guaranteed to see layoffs in airlines (especially Asian airlines) in the coming months. Set a reminder on this comment if you don't believe. I can even name you specific companies that will probably go bankrupt.

- **Layoffs will compound upon itself. When airlines, hotels, restaurants, malls, etc are firing workers, the workers won't have money to spend on buying things. This means other businesses may suffer enough to also start firing some workers. Businesses in 2020 overall are so overleveraged that a large percentage of them are not going to be able to handle even a few months of lower business.** They simply can't pay all the expenses and the debt obligation.

>So if my logic and assumptions are correct, we are looking at an inescapable catastrophe for the Asian tourism industry at the very least. Just in Time manufacturing keep about 2 weeks worth of parts. Most businesses already adjusted their supplies to account for the normal Chinese New Year shutdown. We are now coming up on the limits of most JIT supplies. So expect some pretty bad news to be coming out this week and especially by later this month. I'm seeing pretty big dips in the stock market by April. Probably -15% by April and up to -35% by the end of the year. This will be our ""dip"".

After I posted this thread, the market (American) went on to make record breaking all time highs. I believe a few things are responsible for this:

- Capital flight from Asia

- Monetary actions from China and other nations

- Poor modeling of previous ""health scares"" including the much talked about ""V-shaped recovery""

- Use of lagging indicators. There is still news coming out of ""positive economic news"" like ones regarding unemployment.

- Downplay of the virus by governments and international health organization WHO

- Pure ignorance (this was the ""it's just the flu"" period)

After a month, we've come to find out some more information about the virus. Some are bad but there are some good news as well.

**Let's start with the good news:**

- Various currently available drugs like Chloroquine have shown efficacy in treating infected patients. Don't expect peer reviewed studies anytime soon, this is just based on what was observed in China where health officials tried throwing all types of drugs at it until they noticed Chloroquine seems to work.

- [Speculation] Heat and humidity may play a part in slowing the spread of the virus: see Singapore, India where they have tested a significant number of patients. Singapore is especially transparent and aggressive in finding cases. If they can contain this as a travel hub, then they may have a roadmap for our own containment once the weather warms. Other coronaviruses also slowed in heat

- [Speculation] Diet may play a part in the spread of the virus. Indian diet rich in Curcumin/Turmeric may have an advantage in either fighting infection or dealing with the symptoms of infection. Hundreds of Indian students were evacuated from the epicenter of the Chinese outbreak and not a single one was infected after quarantine and testing.

- Let's all hope the weather can give the Northern Hemisphere some much needed help in combating this virus (stay out of the Southern Hemisphere)

**Now some bad news:**

- [Controversial] The virus may have mutated at least once. The newer strain is more aggressive. This was a fear that was talked about in the thread from a month ago:

>RNA viruses like nCoV mutates extremely quickly. This means potential resistance or immunization from catching nCoV once may be lost if the virus mutates enough. This also means that there may never be permanent immunization. Any vaccine developed for it may only be effective for a portion of the mutations. And each flu season may bring many different strains of this virus that will be unaffected by developed vaccines. In other words, nCoV may be here to stay, much like other flu viruses.

- It is being reported that it is possible to catch both strains at once (Chinese Journal National Science Review)

- [Speculation] Guangdong reports up to 13% of patients tested positive for virus again weeks after ""recovering"". There are many possible explanations for this, some are benign but there have been several reports from health officials in various parts of China that they're seeing reinfection. Some viruses, the ones that target and manipulate the immune system response, cause more damage the second/third+ time of infection. Some diseases use our antibodies to cause more damage. 

- Patients who ""recovered"" from the virus including the recent man in his 30's die after recovery. There is lasting lunge damage in some patients. This means worse lunge function and injuries that allow for opportunistic infections.

- WHO saying around 20% of infected cases require hospitalization. These patients have pneumonia and will drown in lunge liquid if they don't get on ventilators or as a worst case scenario ECMO machines. There are 300 ECMO machines in America. 

- Very little has been done to contain virus spread in America. Up to a few days ago, only 500 have been tested compared to tens of thousands in South Korea, a nation a fraction the size/wealth of us. For over a month since China shut its country down, we didn't even have a working test kit. The earlier one was defective.

**Will things get better or worse?**

- For America, things will get much worse before it gets better."

1. A frontline doctor’s general description of symptoms for the Covid’s first three weeks of illness, and

2. A day by day description of symptoms (from day 1 through day 12) and treatment for the first patient in the USA. He began feeling ill on Jan. 15, was admitted to the hospital on Jan. 20th, and was released from the hospital Feb. 3rd/4.

Symptoms explained by Doctor ihttps://www.straitstimes.com/asia/east-asia/reporters-notebook-life-and-death-in-a-wuhan-coronavirus-icu: and The JAMA https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2761044

“I've observed that the breakout period of the novel coronavirus tends to be three weeks, from the onset of symptoms to developing difficulties breathing. Basically going from mild to severe symptoms takes about a week. There are all sorts of mild symptoms: feebleness, shortness of breath, some people have fevers, some don't. Based on studies of our 138 cases, the most common symptoms in the first stage are fever (98.6 per cent of cases), feebleness (69.6 per cent), cough (59.4 per cent), muscle pains (34.8 per cent), difficulties breathing (31.2%), while less common symptoms include headaches, dizziness, stomach pain, diarrhea, nausea, vomiting.

But some patients who enter the second week will suddenly get worse. At this stage, people should go to the hospital. The elderly with underlying conditions may develop complications; some may need machine-assisted respiration. When the body's other organs start to fail, that's when it becomes severe, while those with strong immune systems see their symptoms decrease in severity at this stage and gradually recover. So the second week is what determines whether the illness becomes critical.

The third week determines whether critical illness leads to death. Some in critical condition who receive treatment can raise their level of lymphocytes, a type of white blood cell, and see an improvement in their immune systems, and have been brought back, so to speak. But those whose lymphocyte numbers continue to decline, those whose immune systems are destroyed in the end, experience multiple organ failure and die.

For most, the illness is over in two weeks, whereas for those for whom the illness becomes severe, if they can survive three weeks, they're good. Those that can't will die in three weeks.”

He disclosed that he had returned to Washington State on January 15 after traveling to visit family in Wuhan, China. The patient stated that he had seen a health alert from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) about the novel coronavirus outbreak in China and, because of his symptoms and recent travel, decided to see a health care provider....

Given the patient’s travel history, the local and state health departments were immediately notified. Together with the urgent care clinician, the Washington Department of Health notified the CDC Emergency Operations Center. Although the patient reported that he had not spent time at the Huanan seafood market and reported no known contact with ill persons during his travel to China, CDC staff concurred with the need to test the patient for 2019-nCoV on the basis of current CDC “persons under investigation” case definitions.8 Specimens were collected in accordance with CDC guidance and included serum and nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swab specimens. After specimen collection, the patient was discharged to home isolation with active monitoring by the local health department.
On January 20, 2020, the CDC confirmed that the patient’s nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabs tested positive for 2019-nCoV by real-time reverse-transcriptase–polymerase-chain-reaction (rRT-PCR) assay. In coordination with CDC subject-matter experts, state and local health officials, emergency medical services, and hospital leadership and staff, the patient was admitted to an airborne-isolation unit at Providence Regional Medical Center for clinical observation, with health care workers following CDC recommendations for contact, droplet, and airborne precautions with eye protection.

On admission, the patient reported persistent dry cough and a 2-day history of nausea and vomiting; he reported that he had no shortness of breath or chest pain. Vital signs were within normal ranges. On physical examination, the patient was found to have dry mucous membranes. The remainder of the examination was generally unremarkable. After admission, the patient received supportive care, including 2 liters of normal saline and ondansetron for nausea.


On days 2 through 5 of hospitalization (days 6 through 9 of illness), the patient’s vital signs remained largely stable, apart from the development of intermittent fevers accompanied by periods of tachycardia (Figure 2). The patient continued to report a nonproductive cough and appeared fatigued. On the afternoon of hospital day 2, the patient passed a loose bowel movement and reported abdominal discomfort. A second episode of loose stool was reported overnight; a sample of this stool was collected for rRT-PCR testing, along with additional respiratory specimens (nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal) and serum. The stool and both respiratory specimens later tested positive by rRT-PCR for 2019-nCoV, whereas the serum remained negative.

Treatment during this time was largely supportive. For symptom management, the patient received, as needed, antipyretic therapy consisting of 650 mg of acetaminophen every 4 hours and 600 mg of ibuprofen every 6 hours. He also received 600 mg of guaifenesin for his continued cough and approximately 6 liters of normal saline over the first 6 days of hospitalization.


A chest radiograph taken on hospital day 3 (illness day 7) was reported as showing no evidence of infiltrates or abnormalities (Figure 3). However, a second chest radiograph from the night of hospital day 5 (illness day 9) showed evidence of pneumonia in the lower lobe of the left lung (Figure 4). These radiographic findings coincided with a change in respiratory status starting on the evening of hospital day 5, when the patient’s oxygen saturation values as measured by pulse oximetry dropped to as low as 90% while he was breathing ambient air. On day 6, the patient was started on supplemental oxygen, delivered by nasal cannula at 2 liters per minute. Given the changing clinical presentation and concern about hospital-acquired pneumonia, treatment with vancomycin (a 1750-mg loading dose followed by 1 g administered intravenously every 8 hours) and cefepime (administered intravenously every 8 hours) was initiated.


On hospital day 6 (illness day 10), a fourth chest radiograph showed basilar streaky opacities in both lungs, a finding consistent with atypical pneumonia (Figure 5), and rales were noted in both lungs on auscultation. Given the radiographic findings, the decision to administer oxygen supplementation, the patient’s ongoing fevers, the persistent positive 2019-nCoV RNA at multiple sites, and published reports of the development of severe pneumonia3,4 at a period consistent with the development of radiographic pneumonia in this patient, clinicians pursued compassionate use of an investigational antiviral therapy. Treatment with intravenous remdesivir (a novel nucleotide analogue prodrug in development10,11) was initiated on the evening of day 7, and no adverse events were observed in association with the infusion. Vancomycin was discontinued on the evening of day 7, and cefepime was discontinued on the following day, after serial negative procalcitonin levels and negative nasal PCR testing for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus.

On hospital day 8 (illness day 12), the patient’s clinical condition improved. Supplemental oxygen was discontinued, and his oxygen saturation values improved to 94 to 96% while he was breathing ambient air. The previous bilateral lower-lobe rales were no longer present. His appetite improved, and he was asymptomatic aside from intermittent dry cough and rhinorrhea. 

As of January 30, 2020, the patient remains hospitalized. He is afebrile, and all symptoms have resolved with the exception of his cough, which is decreasing in severity.

The fate of the Grand Princess has become a significant public health challenge, with a dozen coronavirus cases in California linked to passengers who traveled on the ship to Mexico last month. They include a Placer County man who died of COVID-19 on Wednesday.

At least 21 of the nearly 3,000 people who subsequently took the same ship to Hawaii have tested positive for the virus. All of those passengers remain on board, and many more still need to be tested. It’s unclear what will happen to those who are found to be sick.

A cruise line medical officer said Saturday that the man who died brought the virus with him when he boarded the Grand Princess — a point public health officials disputed.

Dr. Grant Tarling, the cruise’s medical officer, said the man — who died at Kaiser Permanente Roseville Medical Center after leaving the ship — sought medical care onboard on Feb. 20 and had been sick for several days. Tarling said two waiters who served the man multiple times were subsequently infected.
If true, it could mean there was so-called community spread of the virus in California earlier than had previously been detected.

A Placer County health officer, however, questioned Tarling’s statement and said the passenger probably contracted the coronavirus that causes COVID-19 while on the cruise.

“Placer County Public Health has been consistent in our message that our first COVID-19-related fatality likely contracted the disease during international travel to Mexico,” Dr. Aimee Sisson said. “As is standard public health practice, we have based our assessment on the information learned in our contact investigation as well as what we know to be true about the disease pattern.”
Though Princess Cruises officials indicated the short period between the Placer County man boarding the ship and the onset of his symptoms suggested he brought the virus on board, the incubation period for COVID-19 is still unkonwn. The World Health Organization puts it between one and 14 days, most commonly around five days.

Dr. Thomas Frieden, former head of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention during the Obama administration, agreed the average incubation period was five to six days, with a range between two days and two weeks.

“We don’t yet know when people who have symptoms are infectious, and for how long,” Frieden said.
Coronavirus cases had been confirmed in California as early as January, tied to travel from China.
The 75-year-old Placer County man said his symptoms began two to three days after boarding the Grand Princess, according to Tarling.

President Trump has expressed concern that allowing passengers to leave the ship would put the U.S. at risk of accelerating the coronavirus’ spread. Federal and state officials have grappled with how to deal with the cruise ship, where 19 crew members and two passengers have tested positive for the virus.

Vice President Mike Pence said Saturday that officials have developed a plan for passengers that will be implemented this weekend.

“All passengers and crew will be tested for coronavirus and quarantined as appropriate,” he said in a meeting with cruise line executives and port directors in Fort Lauderdale, Fla. “Those that require additional medical attention will also receive it.”

But few other details have been released about the plan.

Across the state, 88 people had been infected with the virus as of Saturday morning. In the U.S., there have been at least 439 confirmed cases, with most in Washington state, where 108 people have tested positive and 16 have died. More than 100,000 people have been infected worldwide, according to the World Health Organization.

In California, it is the Grand Princess cruise ship that has been causing worry of a more widespread outbreak.

By Saturday, the state said a dozen passengers of the Grand Princess cruise that returned to San Francisco on Feb. 21 had tested positive for the virus. Local officials reported four cases in Placer County, two in Contra Costa County, two in Sonoma County and one each in Santa Cruz, Ventura, Madera and Alameda counties tied to the cruise.

The Placer County man who sailed to Mexico is the state’s only confirmed COVID-19 fatality.

The Grand Princess was returning from Hawaii when it was held off the California coast. With testing still underway, officials don’t know how many of the more than 3,000 people on board have the virus.

Friday evening, gloves and masks were delivered to the cruise ship by helicopter, according to Negin Kamali, a spokeswoman for the Princess Cruises company. On Saturday morning, a critically ill passenger and their companion were evacuated from the ship by a Coast Guard cutter.
“They are being transported to a shoreside medical facility for treatment unrelated to COVID-19,” Kamali said. “The captain of Grand Princess and the Princess Cruises port operations team continue to await specific directives from state and local response operations about where the ship will proceed.”

Pence, who leads the task force in charge of the response, said the federal government is working with the state of California to bring the cruise ship into a noncommercial port over the weekend and quarantine those on board as necessary.

Trump said he would ultimately let Pence decide whether to allow passengers to leave the ship. But he said several times that he would be inclined to leave them on board because bringing them ashore would increase the number of official cases on American soil.

Passengers on the vessel — both current and those who may have been exposed earlier — told the Los Angeles Times that the response to the outbreak by the company and health officials had been filled with missteps.

In particular, passengers said Princess Cruises was lax on health screening protocols prior to boarding and withheld information about the risks they faced, even as the ship’s situation became international news.

At a White House briefing, federal public health officials could not say precisely how many people have been tested for the virus.

They said 5,861 specimens have been taken by federal, state and local public health labs. Most patients give at least two samples, one from the nose and a second from the throat.

Dr. Stephen Hahn, commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration, promised a massive expansion of testing availability in the coming days. The CDC has shipped out 75,000 tests to public labs in 48 states and 1.1 million tests to commercial labs, with another 1 million tests going out Monday.

That’s enough for roughly 850,000 patients under the current protocols.
Meanwhile, at the Long Beach harbor Saturday, passengers aboard the Carnival Panorama cruise ship were not allowed off the vessel while officials dealt with a “medical matter,” according to a Facebook post by the cruise director.
Long Beach city officials said on Twitter that a passenger aboard the ship was taken to a hospital and is being tested for the coronavirus. According to the cruise director, the passenger did not meet the CDC criteria for coronavirus risk.
The ship is docked at a Long Beach terminal, but “in an abundance of caution, [the CDC] has decided to hold passengers on board until the patient can be evaluated,” the city of Long Beach account tweeted.

Siehara Kennedy, who is aboard the cruise ship, said passengers have been waiting more than three hours to get off. Passengers are not being isolated in their rooms and have been allowed to gather in the ship’s bars and casino, she said.
Elsewhere in the state, concerns over the coronavirus has led to canceled classes and events. The Elk Grove Unified School District, the largest in Northern California, announced Saturday it would close schools and cancel all student activities — including a prom — for a week to buy time and decide next steps.

Supt. Chris Hoffman said no students have tested positive for the virus, but some parents and family members have.
“I don’t know where this is going,” he said in a news conference. “I don’t know that anybody knows where its going.”

Washington state, where 108 people have been infected, appears to be bearing the brunt of the U.S. outbreak. Fourteen of the state’s 16 deaths are connected to the Life Care Center of Kirkland, a long-term care facility, according to Seattle & King County Public Health. Officials said 15 people in the nursing facility have been hospitalized in the last 24 hours.
In New York, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo declared a state of emergency Saturday after the number of confirmed coronavirus cases in the state rose to 76.

Since  Renee Schwartz developed shortness of breath and a severe cough two  weeks ago, she has been trying desperately to get a coronavirus test.  She has already been tested for the flu — she was negative — and other  problems have been ruled out. But while her doctor thinks a test is  warranted, she told Schwartz she does not have access to any tests.

“I feel like crap,” said Schwartz, 60, of North Hills, Calif. “I want to know, why can’t I get this test?”

While the stories of people who are sick but can’t get tested get widespread [attention](https://act.nationalnursesunited.org/page/-/files/graphics/NU-Quarantine-RN-press-conf-statement.pdf),  President Trump presented the situation very differently on a Friday  afternoon visit to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in  Atlanta.

“Anybody that needs a test [gets a test](https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2020/02/25/cdc-coronavirus-test/?tid=lk_inline_manual_5&itid=lk_inline_manual_5). Anybody that [needs a test](https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2020/02/27/coronavirus-testing-california/?tid=lk_inline_manual_5&itid=lk_inline_manual_5).  They are all set, they have them out there,” Trump said. “As of right  now, and yesterday, anybody that needs a test can get one.”

Production  is ramping up, but tests — and the labs and equipment necessary to run  them — are still very limited. Even where test kits are available, many  states are following strict criteria for who should be tested to avoid  overwhelming their labs.

Interviews  with a dozen laboratory experts and government health officials reveal a  six-week-long series of glitches, missed opportunities and delays that  contributed to the shortage.

“They’ve simply [lost time they can’t make up](https://www.washingtonpost.com/outlook/coronavirus-testing-united-states/2020/03/05/a6ced5aa-5f0f-11ea-9055-5fa12981bbbf_story.html?tid=lk_inline_manual_10&itid=lk_inline_manual_10).  You can’t get back six weeks of blindness,” said Jeremy Konyndyk, who  oversaw the international response to Ebola during the Obama  administration and is a senior policy fellow at the Center for Global  Development. “To the extent that there’s someone to blame here, the  blame is on poor, chaotic management from the White House and failure to  acknowledge the big picture.”

The problems started in early February, at a CDC laboratory in Atlanta.

A  technical manufacturing problem, along with an initial decision to test  only a narrow set of people and delays in expanding testing to other  labs, gave the virus a head start to spread undetected — and helped  perpetuate a false sense of security that leaves the United States  dangerously behind.

Seventeen  people are dead, and there are more than 300 known cases of the novel  coronavirus in the United States and undoubtedly many more cases that  have not been detected.

In late December, when [reports of a new virus](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/asia_pacific/specter-of-possible-new-virus-emerging-from-central-china-raises-alarms-across-asia/2020/01/08/3d33046c-312f-11ea-971b-43bec3ff9860_story.html?itid=ap_lenah.%20sun&tid=lk_inline_manual_16&itid=lk_inline_manual_16) causing [mysterious pneumonia](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2020/02/01/early-missteps-state-secrecy-china-likely-allowed-coronavirus-spread-farther-faster/?tid=lk_inline_manual_16&itid=lk_inline_manual_16)  began to trickle out of Wuhan, China, public health experts went on  high alert. One of the first needs was to develop a test so that  governments across the world would have the ability to track the spread  of the virus.

China  developed its own test. Leading laboratories in Germany published their  own version, which was adopted by the World Health Organization. Many  countries, including the United States, developed their own tests.

The  traditional U.S. strategy for devising new diagnostic tests starts with  the CDC. That is supposed to ensure new tests are accurate and  reliable, but it also meant that other parallel approaches were not  aggressively pursued.

Scott  Gottlieb, former Food and Drug Administration commissioner in the Trump  administration, said, “The key in a crisis like this is to take an  all-of-the-above approach, whether we’re dealing with diagnostics or  therapeutics.” That responsibility, he said, was up to other parts of  the administration, such as the Department of Health and Human Services  or the FDA.

The CDC shared the details of the U.S. test publicly on Jan. 24.

A  week later, the United States declared a public health emergency, a  process designed to speed the development of diagnostic tests and other  medical products. The CDC received the first “emergency use  authorization” to make and distribute its test to the backbone of the  public health system in the United States — mostly state labs.

But the emergency policy, intended to keep quality high, also discouraged [hospital labs](https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2020/02/29/new-fda-policy-will-expand-coronavirus-testing/?itid=ap_lauriemcginley&tid=lk_inline_manual_27&itid=lk_inline_manual_27) from quickly developing in-house tests. They would need specific approval from the FDA to do so.

“Since  CDC and FDA haven’t authorized public health or hospitals to run the  tests, right now #CDC is the only place that can. So, screening has to  be rationed,” [Gottlieb tweeted](https://twitter.com/scottgottliebmd/status/1224043498816655364) on Feb. 2.

The  CDC manufactured kits, and on Feb. 6 and 7, 90 test kits were shipped  to the public health labs. Some labs began to have trouble with the  test. On Feb. 12, CDC announced that the test was providing inconclusive  results in some laboratories. The problem was in one of the three  components of the test.

It  involved a part of the third component intended to be a backstop — a  double-check so that when labs get a negative result, they can trust it.  A federal official who spoke on the condition of anonymity because  there is an ongoing investigation, said the problem may have been a  design flaw or contamination in a CDC lab when the tests were being  produced.

Some  critics have questioned why the CDC didn’t switch to tests being used  by other countries as soon as the problems arose, but the official said  it would have taken longer to apply for a new authorization from the FDA  and validate and manufacture a new test than it would to fix a test  they knew worked in their own lab.

Demand  for testing was manageable at the time — in part because the CDC  criteria for who should get tested required recent travel to China or  close contact with a confirmed case. That [narrow testing](https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2020/02/27/coronavirus-testing-california/?tid=lk_inline_manual_35&itid=lk_inline_manual_35) identified few infections, reinforcing the idea that the country had enough tests.

But  epidemiologists advising the CDC already had been debating when to  begin broader testing to see if the virus was circulating in the  community, said Jeffrey Engel, executive director of the Council of  State and Territorial Epidemiologists. Narrow testing basically  guaranteed that the United States would remain unaware of whether the  virus was already circulating among people who thought they had a cold  or the flu."

The entire Lombardy region is included as well as 14 other provinces.

CNN is verifying exactly when the lockdown will go into effect.

 **The measures also could include:**

* Schools and universities being suspended until April 3.
* All sporting events in those regions being suspended, with the exception of professional events. No spectators would be allowed at professional events.
* People in places of prayer standing 1 meter away from each other. 
* Bars and restaurants enforcing social distancing.

It was written in early Feb so obviously becomes out of date as knowledge/research increases.

But - what it's saying is that people with ME are no more likely to catch coronavirus, but it may have more impact than healthy people (the same as with any infection).

The Dr who authored this piece says that's because ME is not about immune deficiency, but immune activation. (So caveats that there may be differing underlying causes for different people's illness, etc etc.).

My personal concern about coronavirus is basically what the article says - it takes me weeks to get over a basic ""3-day"" cold, so a flu (any flu) is likely to have a significant impact on me & reduce my baseline level of health. With covid-19 in particular, people can be contagious for up to 2 weeks before they're symptomatic, & the symptoms can be very similar to a normal cold, so that's why it spreads more easily. So I'm doing my usual 'flu season' precautions but amped up a little, and keeping a close eye on the situation in my area / places I'm supposed to be.

However, I've seen lots of people with me/CFS say they actually get fewer/no colds now, so, again, depends on how things work for you in particular."

If you're in or have been in an area that's had reported cases I suggest avoiding older people for the 2 week incubation period just in case you're infected, cause people over 50 have a much higher fatality rate. \[1\]

Catching covid-19 means that you’ll likely have to remain in quarantine, which is definitely an inconvenience into your life, especially for people working or in school. Also, it appears to be very easily contagious, and while you may not be immunocompromised, many people have family members who are. No one wants to be responsible for causing the illness of someone else. Furthermore, the greatest fear surrounding covid-19 is the lack of information we have. While it seems that most healthy people do not experience any adverse symptoms similar to the flu, there’s a lot that we do not know about the coronavirus at this time.

If you're feeling sick, give your regular healthcare provider a call. Right now, it's most likely that you've got a cold or the flu or any of the dozens of things that usually circulate this time of year. If you can manage the symptoms yourself, you're golden. 

Now, if you're feeling these symptoms and you've either been to one of the countries or areas that is experiencing local transmission of the COVID-19 coronavirus OR been around someone who actually had the disease, you definitely should call your doc and explain what's going on. My colleagues will work with your doc to get you tested. 

If you don't have a regular healthcare provider, we're working with all of the health centers (City and private and nonprofit) and urgent care facilities to make sure they know what to do. Give them a call before heading in so they know what to expect.

We're definitely not recommending folks head to the hospital for anything mild. Keep the hospitals for the really sick and hurt folks. 

Another thing to consider is that if you're sick, you should seriously consider self isolating. Even if it's not the coronavirus, I'm sure you don't want to get anyone sick.

I would definitely make arrangements to travel back to Korea to help your mother and try to see your father.  It's probably also beneficial to talk directly to a doctor in charge of your father's care beforehand as well to get a direct, blunt good or bad assessment of his condition - it may be that he is deliberately being kept in a medical coma for safety's sake.  This is often done with drugs for patients with a head injury to reduce potential complications or further injury.

You should also absolutely notify your homeroom teacher and/or school principal about the situation - they may be able to reschedule your final examinations and diploma exams for when you return, or even get them administered to you by a school in Korea while you are away.

All indications in every country with outbreaks is that statistically, YOU have little to fear from the coronavirus outbreak.  Your mother, and especially your grandmother or father much moreso given their age and medical conditions."

As the full spectrum of illness is not known, clinical and public health judgement should also be used to determine the 
need for testing in patients who do not meet the epidemiological or clinical criteria. This may include countries not currently identified in epidemiological 
criteria.""

Thus, if the doctor can document rational medical reasons for why they did tested someone outside of the guidelines, that would be reasonable.

However I am not sure if there's a similar clause in the Victorian guidelines.

The main point though, is that this Victorian GP shouldn't be faulted for not testing himself as soon as he got home from the USA, as he has simply followed the government's instructions

The concept of exponential growth ([x10 every 19 days](https://www.scmp.com/news/china/science/article/3074080/coronavirus-global-infections-could-increase-tenfold-every-19)) apparently goes above some heads.

No joke, a friend still insists that it is just racist Daily Mail fearmongering, and another (a retired NHS worker) who thinks that we should expose ourselves to every virus in order to get stronger immune systems. Most others are happy that it won't affect them (being university students). I'm not sure when it will even become socially acceptable to wear a mask.

I doubt many people will even take the most basic measures (hand washing and phone disinfecting) before they see bodies overflowing in the streets or something. Judging by empty supermarket shelves, some people are panicking (and diarrhetic???), but almost nobody I've spoken to seems concerned (at most a detached interest in the situation).

Exciting times ahead for the UK, and I strongly suspect the rest of the EU too. Many governments apparently had little real pandemic planning in place (mask shortages even for health workers!) and are banking on summer killing the virus off.

The 'good news' is that we in western Europe have had so many terror attacks that draconian measures have probably already become a bit normalised, so perhaps there won't be too much direct opposition to containment measures (not that people will *obey* the measures without due threat of legal actions)."

I think one thing we can do is, for business owners and those who are in charge of workplaces, to make it easier for people to stay home if they're sick during this pandemic. On the individual level, that also means preparing oneself to stay home when sick in order to help prevent transmission to others.

Axelrod: I heard some people over the weekend just anecdotally saying, ""Oh, SARS was supposed to be bad. Bird flu was supposed to be bad. The 2009 flu was supposed to be bad. And it wasn't. I'm not gonna subscribe to the sky is falling. And this isn't gonna be that bad."" You're saying, ""Time out, this actually is qualitatively different""?

Lipsitch: **This is qualitatively different from SARS and MERS in the sense that it is ten times bigger than SARS already, or more and about ten bigger than SARS and it is way more widespread. And it's clearly not under control** in the way that SARS was at this point or near this point.

Axelrod: ... Is this coronavirus an existential threat?

Lipsitch: This is not an existential threat. This is, qualitatively, it's very much like a bad pandemic of influenza, which we experienced arguably twice or three times in the 20th Century. It's worse than the one that we experienced in 2009. But none of those brought civilization close to its knees. They made things awful for a while."

As I understand it, it is a protein-coated virus, and as other such viruses do, it will become ineffective as the weather warms (it essentially 'spoils' like food).  

Total world deaths will drop off dramatically in the coming warm months and the final tally for 2020 will be in the low 5 figures, which wouldn't even match the total vehicular deaths in just the USA in a year, and it will be a single-digit fraction of worldwide influenza deaths in a given year, and not in the top 25 of causes of death in the world, not even close. 

The media has been decently effective in creating angst, for two reasons: 1) because web clicks = revenue and every Coronavirus story gets massive traffic, and 2) they see it as an opportunity to unseat the current administration in America.  They will continue to pump out stories ad nauseum, months and months after the evidence shows that the effects have become nominal.

WORLD

As Coronavirus Spreads, So Does Xenophobia and Anti-Asian Racism

￼

People participate in a rally in support of Chinese people and people around the world in fighting the novel coronavirus, COVID-19, in Chinatown, San Francisco on Feb. 29. The protest calls for understanding among communities and support Chinatown businesses in the U.S. Yichuan Cao—Sipa USA

SUYIN HAYNES 

March 7, 2020

ASingaporean student and a Vietnamese art curator are reported to be the latest targets of xenophobia and racism related to coronavirus in the U.K., as a growing number of incidents have been reported around the world since the outbreak started. On March 6, cases of coronavirus worldwide surpassed 100,000 as the U.S. announced its 14th death.

Jonathan Mok, a 23-year-old from Singapore, detailed on social media how he was allegedly attacked while walking down Oxford Street in central London on Feb. 24. He told the BBC that a group of four men told him “we don’t want your coronavirus in our country” as they punched and kicked him, and also said he may need an operation on a broken bone near his right eye as a consequence of the attack.

Mok posted photos of his sustained facial injuries on Facebook, which attracted attention from tens of thousands of accounts worldwide. “Racism is not stupidity — racism is hate. Racists constantly find excuses to expound their hatred — and in this current backdrop of the coronavirus, they’ve found yet another excuse,” he wrote.

On March 6, London’s Metropolitan Police announced that they had arrested a 16-year-old and a 15-year-old involved in the “racially aggravated assault” on Mok, and were appealing to the public for help identifying the other two men in connection with the incident.

“Whenever there’s some kind of major incident with global or regional implications, and as soon as you can identify it in relation to some racial ‘other,’ particularly in predominantly white, multi-ethnic societies like England or the U.S., I think it’s very easy for people to use a very small excuse to start scapegoating on the basis of their appearance,” Miri Song, professor of sociology at the University of Kent, tells TIME. Different groups of people are targeted or discriminated against based on different stereotypes, she says, pointing to the aftermath of 9/11, in which there was an increase in attacks against Middle Eastern, Arab, Muslim, and Sikh people based on their ethnicity and racial identity. Research has also indicated that racism, and race and religion-related hate crime significantly increased in the U.K. after the Brexit referendum in 2016.

Since the outbreak of coronavirus, which was first officially reported to the World Health Organization by Chinese authorities in Wuhan on Dec. 31, several accounts of racism and xenophobia have been reported and documented on social media. While some governments and politicians have denounced such incidents related to the outbreak, others think much more could be done to show support for Chinese communities worldwide. Last week, Michelle Bachelet, the U.N. human rights chief, called on member states to combat discrimination triggered by the virus.

Mok’s case is by no means an isolated incident. On March 6, rights groups condemned what appeared to be a racially motivated crime in New York City, as video footage emerged of a man on a subway train arguing with and spraying air freshener at a fellow passenger, who is Asian-American. Local media reported that the New York Police Department is now investigating the case as a possible hate crime.

On March 5, it was reported that a Vietnamese art curator was dropped by an exhibitor at a U.K. art fair who claimed her participation would be seen as “carrying the virus.” An Nguyen shared a screenshot on social media of an email she had received from Raquelle Azran, a New York-based art dealer specializing in Vietnamese art, which cancelled Nguyen’s assistance at London’s Affordable Art Fair spring event. “The corona virus is causing much anxiety everywhere, and fairly or not, Asians are being seen as carriers of the virus,” wrote Azran. “Your presence on the stand would unfortunately create hesitation on the part of the audience to enter the exhibition space.” After backlash on social media, Azran apologized “for any offence” caused by the email, reports The Independent. “If you are seeing that the issue is solely with the person in question alone, it is not.” Nguyen posted an Instagram story, adding that it was “normalizing non-aggressive discrimination” that needed to change.

As in several countries, Mok and Nguyen’s cases indicate that discrimination is not only targeting mainland Chinese people, but people of east and south east Asian descent more broadly, including those who are not first-generation immigrants. “I don’t think most of the people who tend to harbor these kinds of hatreds or prejudices are interested in the specifics of your ethnic or racial background,” says sociologist Song. “Because of your racial phenotype, you’re automatically deemed to be foreign.”

And while the outbreak started in Wuhan, its global spread has reached far beyond mainland China, infecting people in dozens of countries, making it impossible to attribute the virus to somebody on the basis of their racial identity. “As soon as you’re dealing with a globalized world, where people are traveling, and are so numerous and impossible to track, it’s clearly wrong to be targeting people simply on the basis of their appearance,” says Song."

It's also important to keep in mind that something like CFR is a full population measure, not an individual risk assessment. I've already seen some people interpret the (inflated) 4% CFR as ""if you get COVID-19, you have a 4% chance of dying, which is more likely than flipping 5 heads in a row."" If you're over 60 or immunocompromised, bad news is that it's a lot worse than that and you need to be extremely careful if you aren't already; if you're not in one of those groups, good news is that the risk to you is vanishingly small and you're flipping more like 10 heads before you get to the chance of it killing you.

>Inside Trump Administration, Debate Raged Over What to Tell Public

>The administration’s response to the coronavirus has repeatedly matched public health experts against a hesitant White House, where worry of panic dominates.

>By Michael D. Shear, Sheri Fink and Noah Weiland

>March 7, 2020, 4:18 p.m. ET

>WASHINGTON — After weeks of conflicting signals from the Trump administration about the coronavirus, the government’s top health officials decided late last month that when President Trump returned from a trip to India, they would tell him they had to be more blunt about the dangers of the outbreak.

>If he approved, they would level with the public.

>But Dr. Nancy Messonnier, the director of the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, got a day ahead of the plan. At noon on Feb. 25, just as Mr. Trump was boarding Air Force One in New Delhi for his flight home, she told reporters on a conference call that life in the United States was about to change.

>“The disruption to everyday life might be severe,” she said. Schools might have to close, conferences could be canceled, businesses might make employees work from home. She had told her own children, she said, to prepare for “significant disruption to our lives.”

>The stock market plummeted, cable news blared apocalyptic headlines and by the time Mr. Trump landed at Joint Base Andrews early the next morning, his critics were accusing him of sowing confusion on an issue of life or death.

>The president immediately got on the phone with Alex M. Azar II, his secretary of health and human services. That call scared people, he shouted, referring to Ms. Messonnier’s warnings. Are we at the point that we will have to start closing schools? the president added, alarmed, according to an official who heard about the call.

>To health officials, the message needed to change with the outbreak. “The epicenter was shifting” as the number of new cases outside China surpassed those inside, said Dr. Anne Schuchat, the principal deputy director of the C.D.C. “The issue of what this might mean to us became more important.”

>From the beginning, the Trump administration’s attempts to forestall an outbreak of a virus now spreading rapidly across the globe was marked by a raging internal debate about how far to go in telling Americans the truth. Even as the government’s scientists and leading health experts raised the alarm early and pushed for aggressive action, they faced resistance and doubt at the White House — especially from the president — about spooking financial markets and inciting panic.

>“It’s going to all work out,” Mr. Trump said as recently as Thursday night. “Everybody has to be calm. It’s going to work out.”

>Health experts say that telling people to remain calm is an effective message in an epidemic, and it is appropriate that it come from the president. Clear, honest communication is also crucial, and the United States has at times criticized China and other governments for being less than transparent.

>But from Mr. Trump’s first comments on the virus in January to rambling remarks at the C.D.C. on Friday, health experts say the administration has struggled to strike an effective balance between encouraging calm, providing key information and leading an assertive response. The confused signals from the Trump administration, they say, left Americans unprepared for a public health crisis and delayed their understanding of a virus that has reached at least 28 states, infected more than 300 people and killed at least 17.

>A Very Big Deal

>Mr. Azar was at his home in suburban Washington, on Friday, Jan. 3, when Dr. Robert R. Redfield, the C.D.C.’s director, called to tell him China had potentially discovered a new coronavirus. Mr. Azar, a former pharmaceutical executive who helped manage the response to earlier SARS and anthrax outbreaks, told his chief of staff to make sure that the National Security Council was aware.

>This is a very big deal, Mr. Azar told him.

>The Trump administration had eliminated the global health unit that had been part of the National Security Council, but within days, a team was meeting daily in the basement of the West Wing, pleading with Chinese officials to allow doctors from the C.D.C. into their country.

>For weeks, the Chinese refused offers of public health cooperation. “China nice-talked it for a month,” said Kenneth T. Cuccinelli, a top official at the Department of Homeland Security who was working on the coronavirus effort. “‘Oh, well, thank you for the offer. Blah, blah.’”

>On Saturday, Jan. 18, a day after the C.D.C. dispatched 100 people to three American airports to screen travelers coming from Wuhan, China, Mr. Azar made his first call to Mr. Trump about the virus, dialing him directly at Mar-a-Lago, his Florida estate. The president insisted on talking about e-cigarettes first, but Mr. Azar steered him to the virus.

>Four days later, during a two-day trip to the World Economic Forum in Switzerland, the president chose to focus on the positive.

>“We have it under control,” he said. “It’s going to be just fine.”

>On the evening of Jan. 28, a new kind of crisis broke out in the skies.

>The State Department had ordered the evacuation of the American Consulate in Wuhan and a 747 was in the air. But as it headed for the United States with hundreds of passengers who possibly carried the virus, administration officials in Washington were in a frantic scramble about where it should land.

>Dr. Robert Kadlec, the assistant health secretary for preparedness and response, tried to secure some kind of military base in California, but was struggling to cut through Pentagon red tape. In a panic, his staff started booking hundreds of rooms at three hotels in the Los Angeles area, asking for full floors so they could separate potentially infected evacuees from other guests.

>One idea was to land the plane at the Ontario airport outside Los Angeles, and officials went so far as to schedule, then cancel, a briefing for some members of the California congressional delegation. After hours of wrangling, and with the plane still in the air, Mark T. Esper, the defense secretary, said the plane could land at March Air Reserve Base in Riverside County, which had space to house all of the passengers.

>Inside the White House, a debate broke out, centered on concerns that had become ever-present since the virus first emerged: How would the government’s actions be perceived by the public? And what would the president think?"

Edit: also there's no way they're trying to get us to save, I don't know how long you've been playing but, for example, when we had 4 dreams last summer we got a four tiers suit recharge, decent recharges that went up to 40$ if I'm not mistaken. All new suits. They never brought back an old recharge with a new one for a hell event. Especially after a huge collaboration like the frozen one.
Actually this makes me think they did it on purpose so the people that used all their diamonds on the Pavillion would be forced to spend 40$ to recharge and get diamonds for the hell, even though the frost rose suit is actually 20$in the secret shop when it's on its own or 40$ with TWO more suits along with it.

Hospital staff are going to be overwhelmed. You want to help out? stay home, rest and have PLENTY of fluids. Don’t flood urgent cares or regular doctor visits there is nothing they can do for you anyways. If symptoms are that serious you should go to ER anyways. There are going to be people panicking and taking up space where real emergencies need to be taken care of. If you live in a household, it’s your decision on contact. I cannot advise you what to do. Some people will have symptoms, some will be so mild you won’t even notice and some are carriers who show no symptoms at all.  Be smart. If you hear someone coughing, distance yourself. Watch door handles, people cough in their hands. Wipe surfaces clean. Do what you can, but it won’t stop the spread. Stay healthy. That’s what you can do. Take care of yourself, that will help others. You’re young, your medical history doesn’t show any reason you can’t bounce back from this if and when you get it.”

The restrictions affect Milan and the industrial regions that serve as Italy’s economic engine and be the most sweeping measures outside of China.

Italy’s prime minister announces much of the country’s north will be locked down.

Italy’s government is taking the extraordinary step of locking down entire sections of the country’s north, restricting movement for a quarter of the population in a sweeping effort to fight the coronavirus not seen outside of China.

“We are facing an emergency, a national emergency,” Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte said in announcing the government decree in a news conference after 2 a.m.

The move is tantamount to sacrificing the Italian economy in the short term to save it from the ravages of the virus in the long term. The measures will turn stretches of Italy’s wealthy north — including the economic and cultural capital of Milan and landmark tourist destinations such as Venice — into quarantined red zones until at least April 3. They will prevent the free movement of roughly 16 million people.

Funerals and cultural events are all banned under the measures. The decree required distance of one meter, including in sporting events, bars and supermarkets

The Italian outbreak, already the worst in Europe and the worst outside of Asia, has inflicted serious damage on one of the Continent’s most fragile economies and triggered the closing of Italy’s schools.

Italy’s cases more than doubled this week from about 2,500 infections on Wednesday to more than 5,800 on Saturday, according to Italian authorities and the World Health Organization. Deaths rose by 36 to 233.

Nicola Zingaretti, the leader of Italy’s governing coalition’s Democratic Party, announced that he was now a patient. “Well, it’s arrived,” he said in a Facebook video from his home. He said he would follow all the protocols suggested by the authorities, who have urged infected people to self-quarantine."

Investigators from the Department of Consumer and Worker Protection visited the store after a probe by The Post the day before revealed the astronomical prices in the wake of the coronavirus epidemic.

But the fine did little to stop the practice — a worker insisted the shop is not gouging — and won’t drop prices.

“We’re gouging according to them,” the defiant general manager at Scheman & Grant Hardware at Eighth Avenue and 38th Street said.

The store is selling 1200-milliliter bottles of Purell for $79.99, despite an online listing from affiliate Ace Hardware offering the same product for $9.99. The store was also offering 2-liter bottles of the product for $109, though they were sold out Saturday.

The fine — up to $500 — was for the stores $60 price tag on a pack of 10 3M respirator masks — which go for only $22.97 on competitor Home Depot’s website.

Preying on people who are concerned for the health of themselves and their loved ones for a profit will not be tolerated,” DCWP Commissioner Lorelei Salas said.

Shoppers welcomed the sting.

“It’s crazy. They just keep raising the prices. I should go to Home Depot,” customer Mario Moe griped, even as he shopped. “Cuomo should do something about this. He runs the state.  He should give them a fine.”

Cuomo told reporters Saturday that he had directed state and local police departments to investigate unfair price hikes, and established a toll-free hotline at 1-800-697-1220 where shoppers can reported suspect price gouging.

“I want businesses to be aware that you could lose your license for price gouging. This is serious. It’s not just price gouging, it’s price gouging in an emergency situation where you are being exploitive of the public,” Cuomo said at a press conference.

“Not only is it disrespectful, it’s also illegal, and you will be caught,” the governor said."

That's just 10% of infected. Also, it appears that people can be asymptomatic for up to two weeks while still contagious for a portion of that time. With an R0 of about 3.5 to 6 (still no consensus, it seems to differ per country), the number of infected doubles every 4 days. 

So, presume one person gets infected in NYC and arrives in Ithaca and goes to their dorm. On day 4, now it's 2 people. Day 8, 4 people. Day 12, 8 people. Day 16, 16 people. Now that first person starts to feel a bit bad... But if they're in the 80% that just has a minor impact to themselves, which is more likely with younger people like college students, they might not even go to the doctor. 

Plausibly, it's one of those people infected on Day 12 who finally gets sick enough (after 14 days of being infected, but before symptoms are noticeable) to get tested. The test takes a few days, if there is even a test available. NYC has only managed to test 100 people because of the shortage of working test kits! By the time that Day 12 infected person gets a nCov diagnosis, that would be on day 32 of the first infection in the area. 

So, by the time we have one confirmed case, it's entirely possible that there are 256 other people around who are infected and don't know it. 30 days later, that number of infected is potentially 32k. 

Cayuga Medical Center has just over 200 beds. I don't know what their usual capacity is like, but typically hospitals have a 30% unused bed capacity. That's just 60 beds. At a 10% hospitalization rate for nCov, sometimes for weeks, that means that there will be care problems once the number of infected reaches 600 people. Maybe 1000 people if the hospital cancels a lot of non-critical stuff to free up beds. 

Don't get mad if Cornell does decide to shut down even after just one or two positive tests. Those cases would be like the tip of the iceberg that's visible from the ocean surface, while the majority of the infection is hiding from view. 

Do the right thing for your community. If you get a cough, even minor... check your temperature. If it's elevated at all, just self-quarantine and call Cornell Health at 607-255-5155. 

Even if you're not sick, consider spending a few minutes every day just keeping a small ""contact"" journal. Place you've been, people you've been around, etc. If you do get sick, that kind of information could be helpful for professionals to determine what areas to disinfect and what people to test. 

Some simple guidance: 

* Wash your hands regularly, especially before eating. 20 seconds with soap an hot water!
* stop touching your face (most people do it 3 to 5 times every minute)
* stop shaking hands and try to maintain distance between people
* heavily consider not traveling for spring break
* Try to avoid touching stuff like door handles if you can open the door with your elbow or foot 
* Use alcohol wipes and clean your phone screen now and then. The Coronavirus foamites survive for over a week on glass. Pointless to wash your hands if your phone is nasty!

Most of all, pay attention to the emails from the University or visit [https://www.cornell.edu/coronavirus/](https://www.cornell.edu/coronavirus/) regularly. They are expressing the view of the informed experts who have your best interests at heart."

2020-03-07,stupidinternetnames,Coronavirus,13,https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/ff6nho/nyt_italy_locks_down_much_of_the_countrys_north/fjwd57k/,"ROME — Italy’s government on Saturday took the extraordinary step of locking down much of the country’s north, restricting movement for about a quarter of the Italian population in regions that serve as the country’s economic engine.

The move represents the most sweeping effort outside China to stop the spread of the coronavirus and is tantamount to sacrificing the Italian economy in the short term to save it from the ravages of the virus in the long term.

By taking such tough measures, Italy, which is suffering the worst outbreak in Europe, sent a signal that restrictive clampdowns at odds with some of the core values of Western democracies may be necessary to contain and defeat the virus.

“We are facing an emergency,” Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte said in announcing the government decree in a news conference after 2 a.m. “A national emergency.”

He called the measures “very rigorous” but necessary to contain the contagion and ease the burden on Italy’s strained health care system. He said there would now be an “obligation” to avoid any movement “in and out of the territory, and also within” the locked-down areas. Any such travel will require special permission for health or work reasons.

“This is the moment of self-responsibility,” he said.

Questions immediately emerged about exactly how the new rules would be enforced, especially as local leaders in the north complained that they had been given little notice or say in the decision making. More generally, the wobbly Italian government, which has had difficulty passing basic laws, was attempting a crackdown of historic scope in a continent fiercely protective of its personal liberties and in a country with a tendency to interpret laws as suggestions or hurdles to circumvent.

Italy’s outbreak has inflicted serious damage on one of the Continent’s most fragile economies. It has led to the closure of all the country’s schools and, by Saturday, it had infected the leader of one of the two parties in the governing coalition.

The measures will turn stretches of Italy’s wealthy north — including the economic and cultural capital of Milan and landmark tourist destinations such as Venice — into a quarantined enclave. Mr. Conte did not say how long they would last, but an earlier draft weighed by the government on Saturday night said the decree would be in force until at least April 3. The travel bans will prevent the free movement of roughly 16 million people.

By Saturday, Italy had more than 5,800 cases of the virus, 233 of them fatal, with increases of almost 800 infections and 49 deaths from the day before. Only China has had more people die after contracting the virus.

As the government met late into the night on Saturday, ministers insisted that the proposals were merely a draft. Confusion spread about whether officials would actually block travel or only recommend against it.

As soon as the draft became public on Saturday evening, shocked regional and municipal leaders in the north argued that they were caught off-guard and that implementing the rules so suddenly would be impossible.

Mr. Conte also announced early Sunday morning that the government would extend less restrictive measures previously imposed in the north, such as the closure of museums, movie theaters, discos and betting parlors, to the rest of the country. He said conferences of doctors and other medical professionals would be “absolutely” banned. “We cannot allow it,” he said.

Critics of the government argued that the late-night meeting reflected a lack of coordination with regional officials and insufficient communication with the Italian people, which had caused confusion amid the crisis.

Mr. Conte said the regional partners had been consulted and that the authorities would need to approve special travel permissions in or out of the designated areas for family or work emergencies. He said the police would stop travelers to check on their reasons for leaving the locked-down areas.

Funerals and cultural events are all banned under the measures. The decree requires that people keep a distance of at least one meter from each other at sporting events, bars, churches and supermarkets. People with fevers, even if they had not yet been tested for the virus, are barred from leaving their house, Mr. Conte said.

Police officers and soldiers will be empowered to enforce containment measures. Churches could remain open, but Masses will be off limits.

The government decree essentially shuts down much of the northern region of Lombardy, Italy’s largest and most economically productive, which accounts for a fifth of Italy’s G.D.P.

Matteo Caroli, a professor of business management at Luiss Guido Carli University in Rome, said that if “the measures go beyond April, the situation will become systemic and the damage serious.”

Last week the government announced a huge support package of $7.5 billion euros, or about $8.5 billion, in addition to €900 million announced last week for families and business damaged by the virus.

In the Navigli area of Milan, known for its bars and night life, people out drinking on Saturday night lamented “martial laws” while anxiously checking their phones for updates.

“We are enjoying our last moments of freedom,” said Lorenzo Cella, a 21-year-old computer programmer.

Some worried that they would lose their jobs or companions outside of Milan. Others were concerned that the entire economic engine of Italy would stall.

Leaked reports of the draft late Saturday night infuriated Mr. Conte and prompted panic in Milan but also resistance and anger from mayors and regional presidents across the political spectrum in the northern areas.

Attilio Fontana, the president of the Lombardy region and a prominent figure in the right-wing League party, said the plan moved in the direction of containing the virus with decisive measures but also called the plan a “mess,” according to the Italian news agency ANSA, because it created confusion about what citizens could and could not do.

Luca Zaia, another League leader and the president of the Veneto region, which includes Venice and other cities marked for lockdown, said that the government had notified him about the potential ban only “at the last minute.” Since the region was kept out of discussions to draft the order, he said, “it’s literally impossible” for the region to enact it so quickly.

The government order also locks down provinces in the Emilia Romagna region south of Lombardy. Stefano Bonaccini, the region’s liberal president, implored Mr. Conte and the country’s health minister, both nominal allies, for more time to come up with a more “coherent and shared” solution.

Mayors in some of the cities marked for quarantine expressed deep ire over first hearing about the proposed order on television.

“It’s incredible,” said Rasero Maurizio, the mayor of Asti in the northern region of Piedmont, who posted a livid video of himself in a white T-shirt from his home saying that he had just heard about the potential closing of his town on television. “No one told me.”

In addition to Asti, other towns and provinces including Modena, Parma, Piacenza, Reggio Emilia, Rimini, Pesaro and Urbino, Venice, Padua, Treviso and Alessandria — all in the north — were set to be locked down.

But there were clear signs that the virus was spreading southward.

Earlier on Saturday, it touched the top of Italian politics as the leader of the governing coalition’s Democratic Party said he was infected.

“Well, it’s arrived,” Nicola Zingaretti, the leader of the Democratic Party and the president of the region of Lazio, said in a Facebook video posted Saturday. “I also have the coronavirus.”

The infection of Mr. Zingaretti, who is based in Rome, provided vivid proof that the virus was no longer a matter of northern exposure, and that the entire country was now grappling with a public health emergency.

Mr. Zingaretti, the head of the country’s largest center-left party and one of the two parties leading Italy, has daily contact with top politicians in the capital as well as his party’s rank-and-file members.

Already some members of Italy’s Parliament who come from the locked down areas in the Lombardy region have been quarantined. But the infection of a highly prominent figure like Mr. Zingaretti, who felt feverish on Saturday, raised the prospect that more Italian politicians had been exposed.

“Certainly a politician meets and hugs many people,” said Giovanni Rezza, director of the infective illness department at the National Health Institute. “There is a risk of diffusion.”

Elected officials privately expressed concern that the country’s Parliament, with many representatives from the north, could be a new theater of contagion."

2020-03-07,SFMara,Coronavirus,13,https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/fezrv4/what_went_wrong_with_the_coronavirus_tests_in_the/fjtj8go/,"On [Feb. 13](https://www.hhs.gov/about/agencies/asl/testimony/2020-02/secretary-azars-oral-testimony-before-the-senate-finance-committee-on-the-presidents-fy-2021-budget.html),  HHS Secretary Alex Azar testified before Congress that a limited  five-city pilot would begin to add coronavirus to the usual flu  surveillance system to see whether “there is broader spread than we have  been able to detect so far.” But the plan was delayed because  coronavirus tests weren’t available.

Academic  hospitals, which have laboratories that routinely develop tests to use  on their patients, began to get increasingly anxious about the nation  being dependent on the CDC lab. They considered pursuing FDA approval  for their tests but complained they didn’t have the resources or  expertise — or access to crucial materials such as the virus itself —  for the complicated application process required during a public health  emergency.

“When  the CDC test was delayed, then the cases started appearing outside of  China, there should have been a quicker response to get diagnostic  testing going” by easing regulations on hospital labs, said Melissa  Miller, director of the clinical molecular microbiology laboratory at  the University of North Carolina School of Medicine.

During the Zika outbreak, some laboratories developed their own tests and got [letters](https://www.fda.gov/media/96740/download)  from the FDA notifying them that their tests had not been approved.  Even as coronavirus testing remained limited nationwide, the CDC  reminded hospitals on [Feb. 18](https://www.cdc.gov/csels/dls/locs/2020/reminder_covid-19_diagnostic_testing.html) that they shouldn’t do their own testing without an “emergency use authorization” from the FDA.

People  experienced with working on other outbreaks have said that more  flexibility was necessary to get more labs and companies testing.

“I don’t think anyone is used to dealing with a [pandemic](https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/coronavirus-outbreak-edges-closer-to-pandemic/2020/02/21/03afafc0-5429-11ea-9e47-59804be1dcfb_story.html?itid=ap_carolyny.%20johnson&tid=lk_inline_manual_48&itid=lk_inline_manual_48)  like this. None of us alive have ever witnessed a pandemic like this,  or what it could become. I think traditional ways of looking at how to  develop diagnostics, therapeutic . . . have to be thought of  differently, or we’ll never get things out fast enough,” said Mark  Miller, chief medical officer of bioMérieux, a leading diagnostics  company that aims to launch a test by the end of March.

As  days went by, public health labs became increasingly desperate and on  Feb. 25  requested special permission from the FDA to develop their own  tests. The agency declined the request but found a workaround, allowing a  partial CDC test to be used. New test kits began to be sent out in the  following days, with two of the three original components.

Almost as soon as testing capabilities came on line, labs found cases of coronavirus. A week ago, a person in [Oregon](https://www.oregon.gov/oha/ERD/Pages/Oregon-First-Presumptive-Case-Novel-Coronavirus.aspx) who had been sick since Feb. 19 tested positive — hours after state officials got their CDC test up and running. In [Washington state](http://www.snohd.org/Blog.aspx),  one of the cases identified was a teenager who went to the doctor with  ordinary flu symptoms; his swab was submitted through surveillance  testing that was only possible after the testing capabilities came on  line.

On Feb. 29, the [FDA finally announced a new policy to make it easier for hospital laboratories](https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2020/02/29/new-fda-policy-will-expand-coronavirus-testing/?tid=lk_inline_manual_51&itid=lk_inline_manual_51)  to develop their own tests. “This outbreak and our response is dynamic  and evolving,” said Stephanie Caccomo, a spokeswoman for the FDA. “As  the situation changes, we are being flexible as we execute policies  intended to protect public health.”

“Most  laboratories were anticipating a more rigorous FDA stance, and had not  been leaning forward for tests that could have been made more useful,” a  federal health official said. “We were working under the rubric and  framework they set in place, and had they known things could be more  flexible,” labs might have moved forward faster.

Public  health labs had received tests for up to 75,000 people by Friday.  Integrated DNA Technologies, a commercial test manufacturer working with  the CDC, has already shipped 700,000 tests to academic, health-care and  commercial laboratories. The administration said 4 million more tests  will be shipped in the next several days.

Quest  Diagnostics announced its coronavirus testing would be available  Monday. LabCorp announced its tests were available Thursday evening.

As testing problems are fixed, public confusion remains — as does frustration about uneven access to testing.

A California nurse [who is sick and cared for a patient confirmed](https://act.nationalnursesunited.org/page/-/files/graphics/NU-Quarantine-RN-press-conf-statement.pdf) to be infected with the coronavirus said in a statement Thursday that she was still waiting for permission to be tested.

“This  is not the ticket dispenser at the deli counter; it’s a public health  emergency!” the nurse, who was not named, wrote in a statement shared by  the California Nurses Association. “I am a registered nurse, and I need  to know if I am positive before going back to caring for patients. I am  appalled at the level of bureaucracy that’s preventing nurses from  getting tested. That is a health care decision my doctor and my county  health department agree with. Delaying this test puts the whole  community at risk.”"

It's about 2 mice who used to get cheese in the same spot. Then, one day, the cheese stopped showing up. One mouse sat there every day waiting for the cheese, and there was none. The other mouse left his comfort zone and went looking for cheese and did well.

I'm here to tell you, your cheese has been officially moved.

The coronavirus thing is going to get really, really bad. Nobody is going to want to spend time with strangers, and companies are cancelling travel as a matter of company policy. My wife works for a major insurance company and she got notice this week that all travel is cancelled for the foreseeable future. Conferences around the globe are being cancelled. Airplanes are empty, and people are not going to want to leave home.

Exit your comfort zone and do what you need to survive. If you keep sitting there waiting to get a shift, you are going to do far more waiting than working.

This thing will probably last until June/July or later.

To give you an idea of how bad it's going to get, the [American Hospital Association has said](https://www.businessinsider.com/presentation-us-hospitals-preparing-for-millions-of-hospitalizations-2020-3) the following:

(short version)

> Prepare for disease burden roughly 10x severe flu season.

(long version)

> 96 million cases in the US

>4.8 million hospital admissions

>1.9 million ICU admissions

> 480,000 deaths

Most of the people who die are going to be over 60 or already chronically ill. Most others will either not have symptoms, or will have a bad cold. The people who get really ill end up having pneumonia that require 1-2 weeks hospitalization, assuming they don't die in the process.

I'm sorry, but nobody is coming to Vegas in the foreseeable future.

The good news is, you now know what's going on. You have some time and resources to try to figure your situation out. It will be obvious that things are getting weird within the next 3 weeks. Now is the time to act. Vegas may not be the place for you if you have quick opportunity elsewhere."

I was diagnosed with a possible sinus infection and bronchitis combo. There was no mention of coronavirus whatsoever. I was given antibiotics which didn't seem to help and might have been the cause behind my awful nausea. 

Now in Colorado, it's a possibility that the coronavirus had been here for 6 weeks. That would pinpoint a huge tradeshow booth that I worked at two weeks prior to the symptoms that caused me to go to urgent care. Lots of handshaking and close interactions with strangers.

From my understanding, corporate debt is on record highs, a severe supply shock caused by the coronavirus could well be enough to make these corporations default on their debts, which could sent a schockwave since everything is very much intertwined.

In my opinion, the greatest factor here is that the Fed already wasted all of it's ammunition by lowering the rates by 50 bps. It's capability to keep with QE is significantly lower. The market has been relying on the Fed for so long to keep the party going, i think a lot of o panic will ensue when investors finally realize the Fed can't keep cutting rates forever and now the market is on it's own.

Also, again the problem IS NOT the COVID-19, the virus is just the fuse. And even if it was just the virus, the damage done by it is a already done.

Searched for public statements from the American Hospital Association that might confirm the numbers and, go figure, there are none. Per the linked article, the American Hospital Association expressly disavowed the the entire presentation as representing the views of the speaker, not the views of the American Hospital Association. Worse still, the article is based on a single slide taken from a multi-slide presentation. If this were a court proceeding, this is hearsay within hearsay, i.e. testimony or evidence so unreliable that it would be prohibited from presentation. Importantly, Business Insider, the publisher of this nonsense, offers a link to a ""copy of the slides."" But, clicking the link gives a popup stating that for ""complete access"" one must join Business Insider Prime. Signing up for a Business Insider Prime costs $1.00 for a trial membership. So, what the hell, let's see those slides. After going through the signup process, guess what? The ""link"" to the copy of the slides is gone. So, not only do we have a clickbait fear mongering bullshit article, at the end of the day it's a scammy setup designed to lure readers into a recurring subscription with no fucking payoff.

Whether 2019-nCoV infected patients also carry virus in other organs like intestine need to be tested. We conducted investigation on patients in a local hospital who were infected with this virus. We found the presence of 2019-nCoV in anal swabs and blood as well, and more anal swab positives than oral swab positives in a later stage of infection, suggesting shedding and thereby transmitted through oral–fecal route.  

It sounds like it's both detectable AND transmittable through the 'oral-fecal' route unless I'm misunderstanding something."

Italy Locks Down Much of the Country’s North

The restrictions affect Milan and the regions that serve as Italy’s economic engine and are the most sweeping measures outside China.

March 7, 2020, 9:22 p.m. ET

ROME — Italy’s government on Saturday took the extraordinary step of locking down much of the country’s north, restricting movement for about a quarter of the population in regions that serve as the country’s economic engine.
The move represents the most sweeping effort outside China to stop the spread of the coronavirus and is tantamount to sacrificing the Italian economy in the short term to save it from the ravages of the virus in the long term.
“We are facing an emergency, a national emergency,” Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte said in announcing the government decree in a news conference after 2 a.m.
He called the measures “very rigorous” but necessary to contain the contagion and ease the burden on Italy’s strained health care system. He said people traveling out of, or around, the locked-down areas would have the “obligation” to explain why to the authorities.

“This is the moment of self-responsibility,” he said.
Italy’s outbreak, already the worst in Europe, has inflicted serious damage on one of the Continent’s most fragile economies. It has led to the closure of schools and, by Saturday, it had infected the leader of one of the two parties in the governing coalition.
The measures will turn stretches of Italy’s wealthy north — including the economic and cultural capital of Milan and landmark tourist destinations such as Venice — into quarantined red zones until at least April 3. They will prevent the free movement of roughly 16 million people.

By Saturday, Italy had more than 5,800 cases of the virus, 233 of them fatal, with increases of almost 800 infections and 49 deaths from the day before. Only China has had more people die after contracting the virus.
As the government met late into the night on Saturday, ministers insisted the proposals were merely a draft. Confusion spread about whether officials would actually block travel or only recommend against it.

As soon as the draft became public, shocked regional and municipal leaders in the north argued that they were caught off-guard and that implementing the rules so suddenly would be impossible.

Mr. Conte also announced early Sunday morning that the government would extend less restrictive measures previously imposed in the north, such as the closure of museums, movie theaters, discos and betting parlors, to the rest of the country.

Critics of the government argued that the late-night meeting reflected a lack of coordination and communication with the country that had caused confusion amid the crisis.
Mr. Conte said the authorities would need to approve special travel permissions in or out of the designated areas for family or work emergencies. He said the police would stop travelers to check on their reasons for leaving the locked-down areas.

This would all be part of urgent measures to contain the contagion in the Lombardy region and 13 other districts in the Veneto, Piemonte and Emilia Romagna regions in the country’s north.
Funerals and cultural events are all banned under the measures. The decree requires that people keep a distance of at least one meter from each other at sporting events, bars and supermarkets. People with fevers, even if they had not yet been tested for the virus, are barred from leaving their house, Mr. Conte said.
Police officers and soldiers would be empowered to enforce containment measures. Churches could remain open, but Masses would be off limits and the faithful would have to stay at least one meter apart from one another.
The government decree essentially shuts down much of the northern region of Lombardy, Italy’s largest and most productive, which accounts for a fifth of Italy’s G.D.P.

Matteo Caroli, a professor of business management at Luiss Guido Carli University in Rome, said that if “the measures go beyond April, the situation will become systemic and the damage serious.”
Last week the government announced a huge support package of $7.5 billion euros, or about $8.5 billion, in addition to €900 million announced last week for families and business damaged by the virus.
In the Navigli area of Milan, known for its bars and night life, people out drinking on Saturday night lamented “martial laws” while anxiously checking their phones for updates.
“We are enjoying our last moments of freedom” said Lorenzo Cella, a 21-year-old computer programmer.

Some worried that they would lose their jobs or girlfriends outside of Milan. Others were concerned that the entire economic engine of Italy would stall.
Leaked reports of the draft late Saturday night infuriated Mr. Conte and prompted panic in Milan but also resistance and anger from mayors and regional presidents across the political spectrum in the northern areas.
Attilio Fontana, the president of the Lombardy region, and a prominent figure in the right wing League party, said the plan moved in the direction of containing the virus with decisive measures but also called the plan a “mess,” according the Italian news agency ANSA, because it created confusion about what citizens could and could not do.

Luca Zaia, the president of the Veneto region, which includes Venice and other cities marked for lockdown, said that the government had only notified him about the potential ban “at the last minute” and they had serious concerns. Since the region was kept out of discussions to draft the order, he said, “it’s literally impossible” for the region to enact it so quickly.

The government order also locks down provinces in the Emilia Romagna region south of Lombardy. Stefano Bonaccini, the region’s liberal president, implored Mr. Conte and the country’s health minister, both nominal allies, for more time to come up with a more “coherent and shared” solution.
Mayors in some of the cities marked for quarantine expressed deep ire over first hearing about the proposed order on television.
“It’s incredible,” said Rasero Maurizio, the mayor of Asti in the northern region of Piedmont, who posted a livid video of himself in a white T-shirt from his home saying that he had just heard about the potential closing of his town on television. “No one told me.”
In addition to Asti, Modena, Parma, Piacenza, Reggio Emilia, Rimini, Pesaro and Urbino, Venice, Padua, Treviso, Asti and Alessandria — all in the north — were set to be locked down.

But there were clear signs that the virus was spreading southward.
Earlier on Saturday, it touched the top of Italian politics as the leader of the governing coalition’s Democratic Party said he was infected.
“Well, it’s arrived,” Nicola Zingaretti, the leader of the Democratic Party and the president of the region of Lazio, said in a Facebook video posted Saturday. “I also have the coronavirus.”

The infection of Mr. Zingaretti, who is based in Rome, provided vivid proof that the virus was no longer a matter of northern exposure, and that the entire country was now grappling with a public health emergency.
Mr. Zingaretti, the head of the country’s largest center-left party and one of the two parties leading Italy, has daily contact with top politicians in the capital as well as his party’s rank-and-file members.

Already some members of Italy’s Parliament who come from the locked down areas in the Lombardy region have been quarantined. But the infection of a highly prominent figure like Mr. Zingaretti, who felt feverish on Saturday, raised the prospect that more Italian politicians had been exposed.
“Certainly a politician meets and hugs many people,” said Giovanni Rezza, director of the infective illness department at the National Health Institute. “There is a risk of diffusion.”
Elected officials privately expressed concern that the country’s Parliament, with many representatives from the north, could be a new theater of contagion.

The vast majority of those who died in Italy after contracting the virus have been elderly and many had serious underlying conditions and were destabilized by the virus, according to health experts. Italy, which has one of the world’s most aged populations, has already suffered enormously from the virus.

Now, the potential new restrictions of the government persuaded many in Lombardy that there was more hardship to come.
But some welcomed the discipline.
“In China, they are more rigid,” said Miriam Ben Cheikh Amor, a 26-year-old waitress. “Maybe we need some of that too.”
Mr. Conte hoped that spirit would spread, and said that now was the time to band together and obey the new rules, not to “try and be clever.”

But some in Milan were skeptical.
“It will never work in Italy,” Paolo Imparato, a 26-year-old pizza maker said Saturday night when asked about the potential new ban on movement. “People will run away, they will go around.”

I'm Asian, part Chinese and I can tell you there is a lot of racism here and moreso right now because of coronavirus. Just virus related, I've had people tell me to put on a mask, move away from me in public, yell things like ""Don't eat dogs!"" and snatch sanitiser from me and say ""Australians first!""

There are very few Asians on this sub and an army of racists so you'll find this comment at the bottom, but please consider it. 

Personally, I'm a worrywart and wouldn't travel right now anyway. If you can postpone your holiday, try that.  So that you minimise your risk of catching anything, not because you should let racists stop you from enjoying your holiday. 

Businesses are still operating as usual. We have shorter business hours anyway. A lot of Chinese businesses are suffering atm so if you decide to come, show them your support. 

There are certain spots around the city where you can park for free for 3 hours on weekends. Check cityofperthparking.com.au

Speed limits depend. Built up areas are 50, school zones are 40, freeways are upto 100 etc.

I wouldn't say there's any one particular highway kangaroos come out near most frequently. It's not too common to hit a kangaroo while driving in metro areas so don't worry about that.

I wouldn't recommend anyone walk around the CBD late at night. If you go clubbing or anything in the club/bar areas, always try to be with someone. 

Stargazing at night in Albany or Yallingup is pretty safe, but don't do anything alone or stray far from your car.

Smoking in the city isn't hard at all. Idk when Elephant Rocks will reopen"

- there's a COVID emergency number, and you'll get tested if you have serious symptoms or if your life is at risk. If you have light symptoms, you'll be put in quarantine in your own home. I know a few people that had COVID but they described it as just having a really bad cold with fever and persistent cough -in that case they called the 118 (italian 911) but they were told to not go to the hospital. They stayed at home for 1 month and then they got the green light from the local government to go outside. A professor of my college got pneumonia from coronavirus, and he was put in ICU immediatly.

- there is no curfew, no limitation on hours or anything similiar. No food shortages.

- In my area absolutely not. Life goes on almost as normal. I've seen on the tv some people from another region stockpiling food, but it was in a super small town that had very few shops.

- if you are asking regarding insurance, we have the NHS so everyone is covered. Elderly people have been instructed to stay at home. Since here there is a strong family culture, we are taking care personally of them. Otherwise, social services come into play.

#Coronavirus in N.Y.: Cuomo Declares State of Emergency

Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo declared a state of emergency on Saturday as the number of confirmed cases of coronavirus in New York rose to 76.

The governor’s announcement came as concerns about the spread of the virus increased in New York City, which has 11 confirmed cases. The newest one appeared to involve a driver for taxi or ride-sharing services in Queens, officials said.

The epicenter of cases in New York continued to be just north of the city, in Westchester County, where there were 57 in total, the governor said. These cases were mostly, if not all, related to a cluster in Westchester that first came to the authorities’ attention after a New Rochelle resident, a 50-year-old lawyer, was confirmed as New York’s second coronavirus patient.

UPDATE: We have learned of new confirmed cases of #Coronavirus in NYS bringing the total number of cases to 76.

- 57 cases in Westchester County
- 11 cases in NYC
- 4 cases in Nassau County
- 2 cases in Rockland County
- 2 cases in Saratoga County

— Andrew Cuomo (@NYGovCuomo) March 7, 2020

But there were also signs of wider spread, including a pair of cases in Saratoga County, north of the state capital of Albany — the first such confirmed cases outside of the New York City region.

The declaration of emergency will allow the state to speed up the purchasing of supplies and the hiring of workers to assist local health departments that have been handling the monitoring of thousands of self-quarantined patients, Mr. Cuomo said.

“Somebody has to go knock on their door, once a day,” he said during a midday briefing in the state Capitol. “This is labor intensive.”

Get an informed guide to the global outbreak with our daily coronavirus newsletter. 

The declaration would also allow officials to skirt purchasing regulations, if necessary, he said.

New accounts of infection continued to emerge. On Friday night, the driver in Queens tested positive, and the discovery of the case prompted more than 40 doctors, nurses and other workers at a hospital there to go into self-quarantine over fears that they might have been exposed to the coronavirus, officials said on Saturday.

The man, 33, walked into St. John’s Episcopal Hospital in the Far Rockaway section of Queens on Tuesday and reported flulike symptoms. He went home and returned later when his symptoms worsened, an official said.

Dozens of workers at the hospital are now being tested, officials said.

“Obviously, 40 people are out,” said Councilman Donovan Richards Jr., a Democrat who represents Far Rockaway. “The hospital will need to replace those people temporarily. They will need money to do that. They need supplies. We need to keep the health care up and running.”

Tom Melillo, a hospital spokesman, said that the patient remained in quarantine at the hospital on Saturday, and that hospital officials were monitoring everyone who may have been exposed to the patient.

It was not immediately clear whether the man drives a yellow taxi or works for ride-hailing services like Uber or Lyft. Representatives with Uber, Lyft and the New York City Taxi and Limousine Commission all said that officials had not reported that one of their drivers had tested positive for the virus.

Health officials said they were also seeking to determine whether the driver may have exposed passengers.

Also on Saturday, the governor of Connecticut, Ned Lamont, said a New York doctor who commutes to work at Bridgeport Hospital tested positive to the illness. Mr. Lamont said the physician did not show visible symptoms while treating patients and isolated himself.

On Friday, New York City officials asked the federal government to send more diagnostic kits for the coronavirus, saying in a letter that the city’s limited capacity to test had “impeded our ability to beat back this epidemic.”

In tracing people who had contact with the New Rochelle man, a partner at a small Midtown Manhattan law firm, disease detectives learned that he had attended synagogue services before becoming infected.

Public health officials closed the synagogue, Young Israel of New Rochelle, and asked that anyone who had attended services, a bat mitzvah or a funeral there recently isolate themselves as a precaution.

Mr. Cuomo did not say on Saturday how many New Yorkers were now isolating themselves at home over fears they might have been exposed to the virus. But as of Friday, New York officials said they had asked about 4,000 people in the state to self-quarantine.

About 2,700 of that quarantined group were in New York City, and most of them had recently returned from five countries where the outbreak has been most severe: China, Iran, Italy, Japan and South Korea.

At least 44 people in New York State had been placed under mandatory quarantine as of Friday, including 33 in Westchester County, nine in New York City, one in Nassau County on Long Island and one in Erie County in Western New York.

In his remarks on Saturday, Mr. Cuomo said the state was aggressively testing as many people as possible. “We want to find positives,” the governor said, adding that while some people might be disconcerted by the rising number of patients, it showed that the solid medical detective work was underway. “We say, ‘That’s good news, that we know who the people are.”

New Jersey officials said on Friday that four people in the state had tested positive for the virus: a 32-year-old man, a man in his 50s and a woman in her 30s, all from Bergen County near New York; and a man in his 60s from Camden County, in the southern part of the state.

In Connecticut, Gov. Ned Lamont said on Saturday that a second hospital employee in that state had tested positive for the coronavirus. Both of the workers are New York residents, he said.

As of Saturday, the coronavirus outbreak had sickened more than 103,800 people, killed nearly 3,500 and been detected in at least 92 countries.

In the United States, more than 300 cases of the virus had been confirmed, and at least 17 people had died, according to a New York Times database.

I think the powers that be (Trump excluded) in the U.S. are finally starting to wise up, and on the state and local level action is being taken, but too late and still too little   You look at the number of cases now and think ""not so bad"", but given the potential long latency, mildly symptomatic carriers, and the very limited nature of the testing, and the numbers don't look so good.  In Italy on Feb 1 there were two cases, and now there are like 6K cases and 400 deaths (and most of the deaths in the last week).  In NYC area first case was 6 days ago and now there are close to 100 known cases.  And they are not cancelling conferences, sporting events, not closing schools when there is a sick contact (for example parent with known infection).    I am trying not to panic (because I am \*relatively\* young and healthy), but the data from China and Italy make this very scary.  Up to 5% of infected patients require being on a ventilator.  In Italy they are close to being overwhelmed from a healthcare standpoint in taking care of the patients.  In the US there are 100,000 ventilator beds, many/most already in use, so what happens if there is a surge of cases and you get very sick with coronavirus or for another reason?    What happens if health care workers get sick or are pulled for the coronavirus patients, and you need a heart surgery or an appendectomy?"

During that period, hospitals will likely be overwhelmed. The further ahead of time they are able to predict the timing of that final surge, the better they can prepare for it. Also, he said that there are drastic societal quarantine measures which may flatten out the peak significantly, reducing the overload of the medical system, but which aren't worth the social and economic costs until the peak is nearly upon us.

Tracking the spread of the disease accurately should allow the government and medical system to plan and coordinate all of that much better than they could otherwise.

This is not economically possible for most people, at least in the United States.

But, COVID-19 usually takes about [two weeks to fully recover from](https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/coronavirus-symptoms/#duration), even for mild cases.

So, many people can't afford to stay home for every random cold or flu they may catch. But, some people may make an extra effort to isolate themselves, at least from especially vulnerable people, if they get confirmation that they're carrying the more deadly COVID-19."

I don't see any evidence of this. Trump's approval on the economy has been largely positive for awhile now.

> Furthermore his trade wars have rocked the boat for many of the very people he pledged to help.

Besides some market swings, I don't think the typical voter has noticed the trade war at all. Further, I suspect even if some don't agree with Trump's approach on trade, many of them still appreciate him bringing it to the forefront. 

> To make it worse, this stupid Coronavirus is going to mess with the economy and Trump did not prepare the country well enough for it, despite knowing it was coming.

I agree there will be an economic toll. I don't know how much that will impact voters if at all but there are reasons I could see a shift in either direction, for or against Trump policies. As for preparedness, I haven't really seen any compelling evidence that we were under prepared aside from not stockpiling testing kits earlier and it is unclear to me how much of a difference that may have made."

I'm not sure who the author is, and what qualifications he might possess. But the resulting conclusions hold true, regardless of whether his assumptions are spot on.

I hear people (not necessarily here) say that younger people don't get super sick and die, and so they don't need to worry about exposure. But when the public health system is overwhelmed, there's collateral damage that impacts everyone. Do you know anyone who's pregnant? Where would she go to deliver her baby if there were no hospital beds? Kids might not be susceptible to severe infection from coronavirus, but what happens if your kid has influenza and needs emergency care - again, when there aren't any open hospital beds? Or you have a heart attack and can't get an ambulance? In a way, you can die from the coronavirus even if you don't actually contract it yourself.

And even for vulnerable populations, you can often get good care when a hospital bed is available. But if there's a surge of cases, and your 70 year old mother shows up at the hospital needing a ventilator, and they're all in use, her risk of death will undoubtedly be higher than during 'normal' time.

Slowing the rate of community infections keeps the public health system operable, and that helps everyone..."

From Dr. Abu Sharkawy
I'm a doctor and an Infectious Diseases Specialist. I've been at this for more than 20 years seeing sick patients on a daily basis. I have worked in inner city hospitals and in the poorest slums of Africa. HIV-AIDS, Hepatitis,TB, SARS, Measles, Shingles, Whooping cough, Diphtheria...there is little I haven't been exposed to in my profession. And with notable exception of SARS, very little has left me feeling vulnerable, overwhelmed or downright scared. 

I am not scared of Covid-19. I am concerned about the implications of a novel infectious agent that has spread the world over and continues to find new footholds in different soil.  I am rightly concerned for the welfare of those who are elderly, in frail health or disenfranchised who stand to suffer mostly, and disproportionately, at the hands of this new scourge. But I am not scared of Covid-19.

What I am scared about is the loss of reason and wave of fear that has induced the masses of society into a spellbinding spiral of panic, stockpiling obscene quantities of anything that could fill a bomb shelter adequately in a post-apocalyptic world. I am scared of the N95 masks that are stolen from hospitals and urgent care clinics where they are actually needed for front line healthcare providers and instead are being donned in airports, malls, and coffee lounges, perpetuating even more fear and suspicion of others. I am scared that our hospitals will be overwhelmed with anyone who thinks they "" probably don't have it but may as well get checked out no matter what because you just never know..."" and those with heart failure, emphysema, pneumonia and  strokes will pay the price for overfilled ER waiting rooms with only so many doctors and nurses to assess. 

I am scared that travel restrictions will become so far reaching that weddings will be canceled, graduations missed and family reunions will not materialize. And well, even that big party called the Olympic Games...that could be kyboshed too. Can you even 
imagine?

I'm scared those same epidemic fears will limit trade, harm partnerships in multiple sectors, business and otherwise and ultimately culminate in a global recession. 

But mostly, I'm scared about what message we are telling our kids when faced with a threat. Instead of reason, rationality, openmindedness and altruism, we are telling them to panic, be fearful, suspicious, reactionary and self-interested.

Covid-19 is nowhere near over. It will be coming to a city, a hospital, a friend, even a family member near you at some point. Expect it.  Stop waiting to be surprised further. The fact is the virus itself will not likely do much harm when it arrives. But our own behaviors and ""fight for yourself above all else"" attitude could prove disastrous. 

I implore you all. Temper fear with reason, panic with patience and uncertainty with education. We have an opportunity to learn a great deal about health hygiene and limiting the spread of innumerable transmissible diseases in our society. Let's meet this challenge together in the best spirit of compassion for others, patience, and above all, an unfailing effort to seek truth, facts and knowledge as opposed to conjecture, speculation and catastrophizing.

Facts not fear. Clean hands. Open hearts.
Our children will thank us for it."

The government used to employ tens of thousands of people to build levees about the yellow river to contain floods that would otherwise kill hundreds of thousands or millions and devastate surrounding farmlands, which could plunge whole regions into famine. Likewise the government response to contain the Mongol/invader threats was to mobilise people to build defences like the great wall etc. And it has otherwise dealt with wars, colonisation and internal strife, and previous epidemics such as the spanish flu and black death also likely originated from and swept through china many times. It is a place that has a strong tradition of meeting extraordinary levels of crisis with community organisation, and that tradition predates its current political system. In fact you could make the argument that autocracy is possible in china *because* of its long tradition of government organisation and competence. But ultimately how effective the ccp is at upholding that tradition is unclear. In the case of the coronavirus, the ccp bungled the initial containment because it was more interested in saving face than in protecting its people. It’s hardly the response you’d hope for."

Assuming that we keep the same amount of testing, then it is how it works,  if you get tested positive for Coronavirus, you're probability of death is 3%, as of right now.

If we increase testing to increase the amount of positive results (and therefore lower the actual fatality rate) then the probability of death diminishes.

I learned from fall of 2018 that it's dangerous to play both sides. You should gauge the current sentiment and play that trend, but never expose yourself enough that a trend reversal will kill you. With yield curves at all time lows and coronavirus uncertainty, sentiment is definitely bad and trend is down. Things likely won't just fall down all at once, but they will trend down. 

Uncertainty is the #1 thing that is an easy read on the direction of wallstreet. All major multi month downtrends have come from uncertainty. It was the trade war and fed hikes. Now it's coronavirus.

https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/08/doctor-who-had-coronavirus-demands-apology-from-victorian-health-minister-over-inaccuracies

Article on doctor in Australia outlining he didn't meet requirements to be tests and had what he considered a 'mild cold'.

https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/cases-in-us.html

This outlines CDCs method of data use, 

>Data include both **confirmed and presumptive positive case**s of COVID-19 reported to CDC or tested at CDC since January 21, 2020, with the exception of testing results for persons repatriated to the United States from Wuhan, China and Japan. State and local public health departments are now testing and publicly reporting their cases. In the event of a discrepancy between CDC cases and cases reported by state and local public health officials, data reported by states should be considered the most up to date.

My inference from this is that they are not extrapolating minor cases in society, and are basing solely off tested individuals (which IS the responsible thing to do).

In regard to overstating mortality rates, I doubt I'll find a source, but you assume deaths are reported reasonably accurately, yet total confirmed cases will be more inaccurate (due to not collecting minor symptom, untested individuals).

This means that the death number, may vary in a minor way, but the 'total cases' can only vary in a manor that increases. I.e. 1000 confirmed cases means there are AT LEAST 1000 cases. So 50 deaths (accurate) over 1000 confirmed cases (likely more) could be in reality 50 deaths over 2000 cases. - Essentially halving the mortality rate.

Final mortality rate will be lower than that currently reported by CDC - this is a function of data collection, not a conspiracy."

Top federal health officials on Saturday said they don't know how many people in the U.S. have been tested for coronavirus — or how many will need to be in the coming weeks. 

The health officials, in an untelevised briefing at the White House, also defended President Donald Trump's claim on Friday that anyone seeking a test can get one, even as state officials voice frustration with the availability of tests. 
Federal government labs have tested specimens for 1,583 people, but the Trump administration does not have figures for the numbers of people tested at state and local labs, Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar and Food and Drug Administration Commissioner Stephen Hahn told reporters. They said said that 5,861 specimens have been tested across the country, but it's not clear how many people that translates to because each test requires multiple specimens and people get multiple tests. 

The administration has previously struggled to communicate how many tests have been conducted. Azar last Sunday said more than 3,600 people had been tested, but two days later Anne Schuchat, a top CDC official, testified in the Senate that more than 3,000 specimens had been taken from 500 people — a fraction of what Azar claimed.

On Friday night, a man who drives for taxi or ride-hailing services in Queens has tested positive for the coronavirus, and the discovery of the new case prompted more than 40 doctors, nurses and other workers at a hospital there to go into self-quarantine over fears that they might have been exposed, officials said on Saturday.

The man, 33, walked into St. John’s Episcopal Hospital in the Far Rockaway section of Queens on Tuesday and reported flulike symptoms. He went home and returned later when his symptoms worsened, an official said.

Dozens of workers at the hospital are now in isolation and are being tested.

“This is a new case,” said Councilman Donovan Richards Jr., a Democrat who represents Far Rockaway. “And the first in Queens.”

“Obviously, 40 people are out,” Mr. Richards said. “The hospital will need to replace those people temporarily. They will need money to do that. They need supplies. We need to keep the health care up and running.”

Tom Melillo, a hospital spokesman, said the patient remained in quarantine at the hospital on Saturday.

Mr. Melillo said hospital officials are monitoring everyone who may have been exposed to the patient.

It was not immediately clear whether the man drives a yellow taxi or works for ride-hailing services like Uber or Lyft.

Representatives with both Uber and Lyft said officials with the New York Department of Health have not reported that one of their drivers had tested positive for the virus.

Health officials said they were also seeking to determine whether the driver may have exposed passengers

Before Saturday, New York State had nearly 50 people who had tested positive for the illness, most of them in Westchester County, just north of New York City.

The new case in Queens appears to put the total for the city at five.

On Friday, New York City officials asked the federal government to send more diagnostic kits for the coronavirus, saying in a letter that the city’s limited capacity to test had “impeded our ability to beat back this epidemic.”

Public health workers and government officials have linked a majority of the state’s cases to a cluster in Westchester that first came to the authorities’ attention after a New Rochelle resident was confirmed as New York’s second coronavirus patient.

In tracing people who had contact with the man, a partner at a small Midtown Manhattan law firm, disease detectives learned that he had attended synagogue services before becoming infected.

Public health officials closed the synagogue, Young Israel of New Rochelle, and asked that anyone who had attended services, a bat mitzvah or a funeral there recently isolate themselves as a precaution.

As of Friday, New York officials said they had asked about 4,000 people in the state who might have been exposed to the virus to isolate themselves at home.

About 2,700 of that group were in New York City, and most of them had recently returned from five countries where the outbreak has been most severe: China, Iran, Italy, Japan and South Korea.

At least 44 people in New York State had been placed under mandatory quarantine as of Friday, including 33 in Westchester County, nine in New York City, one in Nassau County on Long Island and one in Erie County in Western New York.

New Jersey officials said on Friday that four people in the state had tested positive for the virus: a 32-year-old man, a man in his 50s and a woman in her 30s, all from Bergen County near New York; and a man in his 60s from Camden County, in the southern part of the state.

Also on Friday, Gov. Ned Lamont of Connecticut said that an employee of a Danbury hospital who lives in Westchester County had tested positive for the virus."

The silver lining is that at least China didn't try to hide this incident, as mainstream media there readily picked up on this story. 

The media there also covered the incident where desperate wuhan residents under lockdown shouted at visiting top politburo official that the lockdown zone tour was all fake and staged (take note WHO officials!).

It's not just him either, it's the White House in general.  It's just super obvious with him because it's happened so many times in videos that aren't contested at the time (so, not deep fakes and all over the news) and his statements are later proven false."

The Ant and the Grasshopper, alternatively titled The Grasshopper and the Ant (or Ants), is one of Aesop's Fables, numbered 373 in the Perry Index. The fable describes how a hungry grasshopper begs for food from an ant when winter comes and is refused. The situation sums up moral lessons about the virtues of hard work and planning for the future.Even in Classical times, however, the advice was mistrusted and an alternative story represented the ant's industry as mean and self-serving. Jean de la Fontaine's delicately ironical retelling in French later widened the debate to cover the themes of compassion and charity.

PS, the media has a vested interest in creating as much fear as possible so that people will continue to ""tune in"". The more people watching the more money they will make. The more controversy the bigger they get.

Yes, it's true that in China there are a lot of people getting it and a lot of people dying from it. In the USA we have had 19 deaths. It's sad, but people die all the time for a lot of things. People die way more in car crashes but you don't see people freaking out about cars. How about the yearly flu that takes many many more lives in the US?

34,200 died from the flu last season: https://www.cdc.gov/flu/about/burden/2018-2019.html
1200 already this season.

Nearly 1.25 million people die in road crashes each year.
https://www.asirt.org/safe-travel/road-safety-facts/

Chances are still very low that cold symptoms are coronavirus for your average person. Likely just a regular flu or cold strain. Luckily, the treatment and response measures are the same for both. Stay home. Get plenty of rest and fluids. Use OTC decongestants, cough suppressants, and antipyretics as needed. If you start having trouble breathing or run a fever over 103 degrees, or symptoms continue to worsen after several days or fail to improve after two weeks go to the hospital. Once you recover, do your best to decontaminate your home. Wash bedding and clothes (use bleach if possible or the sanitary cycle on your machine if it has one). Wipe down hard surfaces and common touchpoints. Air out your home if weather permits. 

If you have reason to think you've been exposed to COVID19, it would be a good idea to contact the Mass health department for further guidance on whether you should be tested. If you have an underlying condition, or are a small child or over 55, you should also contact Mass Health to see if further action should be taken."

I'm 22 y/o female from the UK travelling around asia on my first solo trip. I was in South Korea then Japan and on a whim decided to go to Taiwan. I've been told I have to home quarentine for 2 weeks because of the coronavirus outbreak. In the airport I was just like yeah sure but I've been looking online and apparently this is really serious and there are big fines for going outside even for a short time and I can't leave the country until the quarentine is up. It's not really been an issue in the other countries I've been to.

I'm just staying in a cheap hostel but am thinking on moving to a nicer hotel room because it's fine but I can't really quarentine here. I was planning to contact the embassy when they're open on Monday to keep them informed of my address. I tried calling the number on the form I was given but it's all in Cantonese. I know I've been really stupid and I should've looked this all up before I flew but this is my first time doing anything like this and rn just feel stressed and scared and lonely. Does anyone have any advice?

How can I avoid the fines?
Have you been in a situation like this before?
Can I claim the money back that I'm using to quarentine myself from anywhere?
Does anyone know anything else that's useful? Like about how this works?
What do I do completely alone for 2 weeks?

Please help me, thank you"
