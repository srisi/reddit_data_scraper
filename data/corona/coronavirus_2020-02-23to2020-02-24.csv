Severe pneumonia caused by pathogenic hCoVs is often associated with rapid virus replication, massive inflammatory cell infiltration and elevated pro-inflammatory cytokine/chemokine responses resulting in acute lung injury (ALI), and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).

Cytokine storm and ARDs:
A cytokine storm is an overproduction of immune cells and their activating compounds (cytokines), which, in a flu infection, is often associated with a surge of activated immune cells into the lungs.

Aroused by the presence of a viral invader, our bodies step up to fight the disease by flooding the lungs with immune cells to clear away the damage and repair the lung tissue.

When working properly, this inflammatory process is tightly regulated and confined only to infected areas. But sometimes your immune system goes haywire and those cells kill anything in their way, including your healthy tissue.

So you get more damage instead of less from the immune response. Even more debris clogs up the lungs, and pneumonia worsens. 

During the third phase, lung damage continues to build—which can result in respiratory failure. Even if death doesn’t occur, some patients survive with permanent lung damage. According to the WHO, SARS punched holes in the lungs, giving them “a honeycomb-like appearance”—and these lesions are present in those afflicted by novel coronavirus, too.

These holes are likely created by the immune system’s hyperactive response, which creates scars that both protect and stiffen the lungs.

When that occurs, patients often have to be put on ventilators to assist their breathing. Meanwhile, inflammation also makes the membranes between the air sacs and blood vessels more permeable, which can fill the lungs with fluid and affect their ability to oxygenate blood.

In severe cases, you basically flood your lungs and you can’t breathe. That’s how people are dying. They’re drowning. 

Overall, an immune system that is strong can be your downfall."

**The rise of anti-Chinese racism**

While the Chinese people and their government battle the virus and a imperialist-led disinformation campaign, the virus of anti-Chinese racism is another enemy they face. Stories proliferate the print and electronic media of racist signs and verbal abuse of Chinese people and other Asian people perceived as Chinese.

Around the world from Korea to Singapore to Japan to Italy, stores have signs that Chinese are not welcome. In Paris a Chinese restaurant was tagged with racist slogans blaming them for coronavirus. A Paris newspaper had overtly racist headlines of “Yellow Peril” and “Yellow alert” on articles reporting on the epidemic.

In Canada, a news reporter tweeted out an image of his Asian barber in a mask and said, “Hopefully all I got today was a haircut.” Appropriately, he was fired from his job.

Wikipedia has an entry entitled, “Xenophobia and racism related to the 2019–20 coronavirus outbreak,” with multiple accounts from 26 countries.

In California high school students assaulted a classmate, accusing him of being infected. College students have tweeted racist messages about dropping classes that have too many Asians.

The racist practice of not recognizing the different Asian nations has resulted in a Vietnamese boy in a Los Angeles elementary school being sent to the nurse because he coughed from swallowing water while other students who were coughing were not. Upon his return, classmates teased him about having coronavirus.

Far more serious racist activities meant to target Chinese and other Asian people have happened. In Los Angeles, a flyer with a World Health Organization logo was posted in an area neighborhood telling people to avoid Asian American establishments to avoid being exposed to COVID-19.

Blaming a particular group of people for a medical crisis is not a new phenomena in the United States. The history of the HIV/AIDS epidemic is a historically recent example how the government and societal institutions were quick to first blame Africans, then Haitians and then when the epidemic disproportionately hit the queer community, gay men in particular had to face both the disease and violent anti-gay bigotry.

The best antidote to COVID-19 and to anti-Chinese racism is solidarity and public health practices to manage the epidemic. In Wuhan, China, the epicenter of the disease, residents have been shouting “Wuhan jiāyóu” meaning, “Wuhan, stay strong” in solidarity with each other and as encouragement to the public health workers in the streets combating the virus.

“Wuhan jiāyóu!”"

This is a pulmonary disease. As this spreads, pay close attention to mortality rates in developed countries: those with modern hospitals, without a cultural stigma to admitting illness in the family, and without a government that regularly adjusts reported metrics downward to save face. The primary danger for most such diseases lies in the number of ventilators in your local town or city. Most people in good health may very well have excellent odds to survive infection if and only of there is a ventilator available to them. The Wuhan Coronavirus appears to be very virulent but with a manageable mortality rate.

Get exposed early or get exposed late, once beds and ventilators are available in your local hospital. If the local news reports reports overrun hospitals - quarantine for as long as possible but recognize that you will eventually become infected."

Could U.S. ICUs Handle 45,000-Bed Coronavirus Load?

by Joel Zivot, MD 
February 12, 2020

In 2009, I was staffing an intensive care unit where 10 of the first 40 confirmed cases of a novel influenza A (H1N1) ended up as patients in our ICU. Everyone was mechanically ventilated, three ended up on ECMO, or extracorporeal life support. I can't recall who lived and who died. I can recall the feeling that if H1N1 was to have a 25% ICU admission rate, our healthcare system would quickly be overrun.


As an ICU doctor, I am not interested that much in pandemics. My focus is on the patient in front of me and how they will manage. ICU care is a team game and apart from me, critically ill patients require materials and people to create a chance at survival. This has been a bad flu season, and we have a steady diet of sick flu patients, all seemingly unvaccinated, that have kept up our steady ECMO business.

A recent paper described 138 hospitalized patients with novel coronavirus infection in a single hospital in Wuhan, China, claiming an ICU admission rate of 26% and a mortality rate of 4.3%. Upon review, it appears that the overall mortality rate is about 2%-3%. Based on these numbers and additional information, we can create a model for a worst-case scenario here in the U.S.

Let's assume the total number of cases of novel coronavirus to be 18,000 at the time of this published series, with 138 patients admitted to a single hospital. This corresponds to a 0.76% hospital admission rate. The population of the U.S. in 2020 is estimated to be 331 million. Let's assume that 10% of the entire population of the U.S. contracts coronavirus, the same rate as the annual influenza infection prevalence.

If we assume a 1% hospital admission rate, that would correspond to roughly 300,000 patients admitted to hospitals. If we assume 25% of those admitted patients end up in an ICU, that corresponds to 75,000 patients.

According to the American Heart Association annual survey in 2015, the U.S. had 4,862 acute care registered hospitals and 94,837 ICU beds with a 68% ICU occupancy rate. My own experience is that ICU occupancy rate is more than 80% but let's assume 70% occupancy. If we assume the total number of ICU beds in the U.S. is 100,000, this corresponds to an available bed rate of 30,000. This means 45,000 patients over and above the available ICU bed rate.

Imagine now a 20-bed unit with five open beds under normal circumstances and instead, you need 10 beds. To add five beds, you need a physical place to add them, including all of the equipment and all of the staff. You will need roughly 10 nurses to staff these new beds or an additional 60,000 nurses around the country.


An ICU room costs about $400 per square foot to build and the room size should be at least 250 square feet. This corresponds to each new ICU bed costing $100,000.

So adding 45,000 new beds to the U.S. healthcare infrastructure would therefore cost $450 million.

These 45,000 new beds would need to be staffed by new or existing ICU physicians, pharmacists, respiratory therapists, dietitians, physical therapists, and occupational therapists, and supported by additional medical specialists including a variety of medical and surgical specialties.

Coronavirus management will be impacted by benefits and liabilities. It is not a mass casualty event and hospitals won't likely need to face the prospect of many patients at one time. An ICU patient has various trajectories. In an ICU stay, the day associated with the highest mortality is the day of admission. To be frank, a dead patient does not consume resources and some patients will be transferred to the ICU and not need ECMO.

The liability here is not only the rate of rise of new cases but also the number of healthcare workers that become ill. If many healthcare workers fall ill, this will impact the healthcare workforce in negative ways. A mass casualty event does not generally sicken the healthcare worker, but coronavirus has killed at least one physician in Wuhan.

What is our reasonable response to novel coronavirus? A vaccine for this virus might be years away and the occurrence rate appears to be increasing in more than linear fashion. Our response will depend on the actual rate of transmission and our ability to control the spread here in the U.S.

I can only manage the patient in front of me. In order to combat coronavirus, we may need coordination and cooperation much beyond what we currently achieve.”

1. The proximity of the lab to the outbreak. The country is 3696000 square miles in size and the virus appears \~10 miles from the BSL4 lab and about 300 meters from the Wuhan CDC. The probability that a completely novel coronavirus would occur in this specific location in such small proximity to these labs is tiny.
2. The labs in Wuhan are on public record for storing and experimenting with bat coronaviruses (which is what SARS-CoV-2 is).
3. China has past form with bad lab practices. There have been 4 documented cases of a BSL3 lab in Beijing releasing SARS.
4. In reality zoonotic spillover is an exceedingly rare event. I mean, there are only a few I can name of the top of my head that have happened in my lifetime. Doesn't mean it didn't happen, just that it's such an unlikely event that you can't necessarily say that it's more likely than a lab accident.

I think those are 4 logical reasons why people might think it's more likely to have been released from a lab somehow."

- CCP keeps all foreigners locked inside for 5 hours while they 'clean up' outside.
- Foreigner sneakily records some footage from a bus (shown in video) of the town.
- Town is completely destroyed, estimated 500-600 dead.

I had tag review turned on, but it was just too much. He’d also comment all kinds of nonsense on my posts..

Anyway, a friend of his who probably got the same batch of drugs he did ended up calling the DHS and telling them that the CIA has been trying to contact him via satellite (something to that effect). He also used the Internet.

I can definitely see somebody just saying that they have friends/family in high up places to make their ramblings seem more legit.

To be fair though, I do think we will see a recession with that time frame. I saw an economic analyst talking about how the recent dips aren’t really concerning because the markets are still up 30% from 3 years ago even WITH the recent correction due to the coronavirus. If a recession from our current standpoint basically puts us back where we were under Obama, we’ll live."

Among the passengers on the Diamond Princess cruise ship, Americans are the second largest after Japanese, and approximately 330 people who wished to return home were chartered on the 17th without waiting for the two-week health observation period to pass. I left Japan on two planes.

The details of the exchanges between the US and Japanese governments through this series of responses were understood.

According to the report, the Japanese government initially proposed the early disembarkation of American passengers and return home, but the US government expressed appreciation for the Japanese side's response and discussed it with CDC = Center for Disease Control and Others. ""It is expected that the risk of infection will increase if passengers are disembarked and moved to Yokota Air Base, etc. The ship is in good hygiene and should be kept on board."" is.

In addition, at the administrative level exchange held on the 15th, the Japanese side explained that it is possible to sequentially disembark from 19th, after the 2-week health observation period has passed, while the US side should reduce the burden on the Japanese government The decision was made to send a charter aircraft without waiting for the 19th, and to inform Americans of their return to Japan.

A cruise ship, the Diamond Princess, revealed that a man who had landed in Hong Kong was infected with the new coronavirus this month.

For this reason, out of 3711 passengers and crew members who were moored off the coast of Yokohama Port on March 3, virus tests were carried out immediately for those who had symptoms such as fever.

At this time, the Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare requested that all persons be on board until the results of the inspection were found, and decided not to carry out inspections for those who had no symptoms and to return to their homes.

On the 5th of this month, the results of the examination revealed 10 infections, and the Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare, based on expert opinion, set a health observation period of 5 to 14 days and waited in the guest room etc. I decided to get it.

Then, all passengers and crew members who remained on board the ship were tested for viruses, and the results were confirmed to be negative. I decided to get it.
This is due to the belief that individual cabin quarantine will be enforced from the 5th of this month, after which passengers are unlikely to be infected by anyone other than those in the same room.

A total of 969 people left the boat and returned to their homes, etc. over the three days from 19 to 21 this month.
However, on the 22nd, it turned out that 23 of them had not been tested for viruses since the 5th of this month.

In addition, although a woman in his 60s in Tochigi prefecture who disembarked on the 19th had a negative test, he developed fever on the 21st, and as a result of the examination, the infection was confirmed on the 22nd.

On the other hand, according to the Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare, a total of 634 passengers and occupants have been infected with the new coronavirus on board, and they have been transported to medical institutions in order.

On the 22nd, the Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare moved the government-provided accommodations in Wako City, Saitama Prefecture, to 89 people who were in the same room as the confirmed infection and tested negative for the virus. The health check-up period is 14 days from the day the infected person leaves the guest room, and a check is made at the accommodation facility. After that period, a test is performed to confirm that the test is negative.

In addition, the United States and Australia have chartered aircraft and return passengers from their home countries.

According to the Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare, the cruise ship currently has about 200 passengers and about 1000 crew members, including those waiting for charter flights to return home.

The crew will also be screened for viruses, discussed with the cruise ship operator, and will consider taking measures such as dropping off the applicant."

Hope these notes help you stay safe.

(This is from a doctor in Hong Kong who consulted with his friend (who currently works on SARS prevention research) on some effective ways to prevent the Coronavirus.)

About the virus:

1. It is pretty large in size (cell is about 400-500nm diameter), so any normal mask (not just the  N95 feature) should be able to filter it out. However, when *someone who's infected sneezes* in front of you, *it will take a great 3 meters (about 10 feet) before it drops to the ground* and is no longer airborne. 

2. When the virus drops on metal surface, it will live for at least 12 hours. So remember if you come in contact with any metal surface, wash your hands with soap thoroughly. 

3. *The virus can remain active on fabric for 6-12 hours* . Normal laundry detergent should kill the virus. But if you are really worried, you can add some non-chlorine bleach or oxygen bleach . For winter clothing that does not require daily washing, you can put it out under the sun to kill the virus. 

About the symptoms of the pneumonia caused by Coronavirus:

1. *It will first infect the throat, so the throat will have the dry sore throat feeling which will last for 3 to 4 days* 

2. *Then the virus will blend into the nasal fluid and drips into the trachea and enter the lungs, causing pneumonia. This process will take 5 to 6 days.*    

3. With pneumonia, comes high fever and difficulty in breathing. The nasal congestion is not like the normal kind. You will feel like you are drowning in water. It's important to go seek immediate medical attention if you feel like this. 

About prevention:

1. The most common way of getting infected is by touching things in public, so you must wash your hands frequently. The virus can only live on your hands for 5-10 mins, but a lot can happen in those 5-10 mins (you can rub your eyes or pick your nose unwittingly lol).

2. *Aside from washing your hands frequently, you can gargle with Betadine Sore Throat Gargle to eliminate or minimize the germs while they are still in your throat (before dripping down to your lungs).* 

Some of you may not agree with this, but at least you have read it and know some key info about the virus. Hope this helps!"

There are wet markets in every single small and large Chinese city. And yet here, 10 miles away from the BSL4 lab, in this specific wet market, we find a completely novel coronavirus.

3 month later we have 77,200  case worldwide,  75,800 in China.

And the infection rate seem to have plateau in China.

&#x200B;

In that same time, H1N1 virus killed over 16,000 Americans.  With over 280,000 serious cases requiring hospitalizations. Over 29 million infection/ doctor visits.

[https://www.cdc.gov/flu/weekly/index.htm](https://www.cdc.gov/flu/weekly/index.htm)

&#x200B;

COVID-19, like SARS (coronavirus ),  will become yet another viral infection... and like H1N1, people seem very comfortable around it. Send their kids to daycare where infection are prevalent... go on plane with infected people that caught and sneeze. etc...

And we will see some adds for ""Teraflu, COVID"".. see doctor advertize seasonal COVID shots. etc.

And next year.... another 15,000 to 20,000 American will die from H1N1 . And no one will notice, beside the grieving families .

&#x200B;

want to add. no children under the age of 9 died from COVID-19

And the death rate for adult under 50 is less then the flu.

(Data from the CCDC from 44,000 patients in the past 6 weeks)

&#x200B;

in contrast,  27 little kids died from the flu in the US so far this season.

So first, the FDA approves only the CDC itself to diagnose coronavirus. Then on Feb 4, they “emergency approved” CDC’s kits to be distributed to many labs. Only to be used on cases that meet CDC’s guidelines (must have China connection). Except of course, these kits are defective.

Look, as the reader, you are probably so confused right now, but I can tell you one thing.  When I locked myself up in this shitty ass cabin a year ago, I thought I would be safe and would be able to wait out this global pandemic.
 
150 years ago, the world eradicated cancer, but what they were not able to do, was get rid of this thing called the ‘Coronavirus.’  Over time, it got worse and worse for people. What started out as flu-like symptoms, became a worldwide pandemic.  I am sure you must be able to pick up what I’m putting down. What occurred through a span of a century, obviously got worse and more fucked. Science and technology thought they could beat this disease. But things mutated and caused other shit to happen, but essentially, we have fucking zombies.
 
There are a few of us that were able to survive the early stages of the pandemic, and we were naturally immune. Whatever the fuck that means. All I know is that when the news channels started to go down, I had to get the hell out. As I started to pile shit in my truck, I saw children, pets, and neighbors I’ve known all my life, mutate right before my eyes.
 
Bullet and I used to be in the marine corps together, and he even took a bullet for me, hence his name.  With my PTSD, I always had a year’s worth of food and supplies stocked in my basement, and that made it a hell of a lot easier to get out. We drove to my uncle’s gaming cabin 16 hours in the middle of nowhere and hunkered down. At first, it was just fantastic. It was me, my dog, and some whiskey, until last night.
 
Last night I ran out supplies, and all I know is that the wailing is right outside my door."

I'm not taking issue with the idea there may be supply chain disruptions. Just making a big list of every drug that China produces (most if not all which are also produced elsewhere) is incredibly misleading.

You say other things, like ""GlaxoSmithKline has more than 2000 employees in China."" Out of 100,000 employees worldwide, 15,000 of which are in the United States.... 7.5x the number in China. GSK is a British multinational with operations all over the world, if anything it is surprising to me that it has so few employees in China, if it was in proportion to global population you would expect them to have 20,000 employees there. If GSK had a *disproportionate* amount of their business in China, you'd expect it to be higher than that. That it is 1/10th of the number you'd expect if they had a totally proportionate business in China that actually suggests the opposite of your point, that GSK has *less* operations in China, relative to the rest of the world.

Additionally- the drugs industry in China is not all in Wuhan. As you say yourself, ""China has thousands of drug manufacturers, mostly small factories scattered across the nation."" Now while there are certainly disruptions throughout China, the entire country has not shut down. I live in a neighbouring Asian country, I know people who were here on holiday from China for the New Year, and they had an extended New Year break but have now gone back to work. I have orders from China myself that were stuck with this shutdown but that have now started to arrive. There are massive disruptions but the entire country is not locked down.

There is some more, perhaps less sensationalist coverage of this here, where they cover these issues:

>Many companies do have manufacturing plants in China, though mostly for the local market. For example, Merck & Co. has a facility in Hangzhou that supplies drugs to China and other Asian countries. ...

>In contrast, many generic players source APIs in China. This means these companies are more vulnerable to the situation there. **Most API producers are located in provinces of Shandong, Jiangsu and Zhejiang along the east coast of China, far from Hubei, the epicenter of the outbreak** ...

>The coronavirus outbreak has already pushed up API prices in India as companies stock up amid a decline in supply. The problem could also apply to the U.S., given China’s status as a major producer of APIs of antibiotics and vitamins.

>But as Moody’s noted, **several key generic players in the U.S. market, including Amneal Pharmaceuticals, Mylan and Teva, manufacture a lot of their own APIs in the U.S. and Europe.** “Supply disruptions in China could benefit these companies, which would be able to raise prices if one or more of their competitors is sidelined,” the financial analytics company said in the report.

>China’s WuXi Biologics announced this week it has restarted production at three sites. AstraZeneca CEO Pascal Soriot in a call with media said production at its two sites has resumed and they were nearly up to full speed, Bloomberg reports. 

>“So far, we’ve had relatively limited disruption to our activities,” Soriot said. “We’ll get past this epidemic and China will remain a very important part of our company.”

>But in an emergency meeting in Brussels, concerns about shortages were raised by health ministers from France and Finland, CTGN reports. EU Health Commissioner Stella Kyriakides said her group has a task force monitoring supplies, and, for now, no shortages are in evidence. ...

>In India, which gets two-thirds of its APIs from China, the government determined drugmakers have about two-months supply on hand, the Indian Express reports. That is particularly important to the U.S. since the FDA estimates that India accounts for 40% of the U.S. generics.

As in, what makes it more difficult to develop a vaccine for a new strain of a Coronavirus than a new strain of influenza?

One absolutely different thing to consider is possible antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) of viral entry for coronaviruses, there was some quite recent and serious academical science study on such phenomenon:

> ADE has been observed for coronaviruses. Several studies have shown that sera induced by SARS-CoV spike enhance viral entry into Fc-receptor-expressing cells. Further, one study demonstrated that unlike receptor-dependent viral entry, sera dependent SARS-CoV entry does not go through the endosome pathway.
> Additionally, it has long been known that **immunization of cats with feline coronavirus spike leads to worsened future infection due to the induction of infection-enhancing antibodies**. However, detailed molecular mechanisms for ADE of coronavirus entry are still unknown.

https://jvi.asm.org/content/94/5/e02015-19.long

What it might mean in practice:

> 
> It’s highly possible to get infected a second time,” one of the doctors, who declined to be identified, told the outlet.
> 
> The physician said that medication used to treat the virus can have negative side effects on patients’ heart tissue, making them more susceptible to cardiac arrest.
> 
> “A few people recovered from the first time by their own immune system, but the meds [sic] they use are damaging their heart tissue, and **when they get it the second time, the antibody doesn’t help but makes it worse**, and they die a sudden death from heart failure,” the doctor said.

https://nypost.com/2020/02/19/whistleblower-doctors-say-coronavirus-reinfection-even-deadlier/amp/?__twitter_impression=true&utm_source=reddit.com

So initially most cases may be so mild that most people in US will just brush it off as bad, but simple flu and then get reinfected with way worse consequences. It will take some time inevitably to really confirm such turn of events, but in China reinfection already has become semi-official thing:

> A previously recovered novel coronavirus patient in Chengdu, Sichuan province was re-hospitalized after testing positive for the virus on Wednesday, the city’s health administration told the Beijing Youth Daily on Friday. The patient had previously recovered from the disease 10 days earlier.

HOWEVER, it does make some seemingly sensible arguments that bring into question the arguments presented in a FactCheck piece section on CoV-19's origin.  
In particular, some reasons/sub-questions that mean the answer to this question warrants an update:  


1.Applying Occam's razor, what's the most likely reason(s) that this announcement would be made when it was, despite the optics:

\[On Friday\], the  Chinese Ministry of Science and Technology released a new directive  entitled: “Instructions on strengthening biosecurity management in  microbiology labs that handle advanced viruses like the novel  coronavirus.""

I can't see any hierarchy of Chinese officials okaying such an announcement except under  intense pressure from, and to appease or pacify a group of research  scientists angry enough about the poor security to blow the whistle on it  having failed in THIS case.  


2.And  this is pretty strong circumstantial evidence too: ""\[H\]ow many  “microbiology labs” are there in China that handle “advanced viruses  like the novel coronavirus”?  


It  turns out that in all of China there is only one. And this one is  located in the Chinese city of Wuhan that just happens to be . . . the  epicenter of the epidemic.""  


3.And this three:

""Even the deadly SARS virus has escaped — twice — from the Beijing lab  where it was — and probably is — being used in experiments. Both  “man-made” epidemics were quickly contained, but neither would have  happened at all if proper safety precautions had been taken.""  


4.And this four:(and I'm not even including all of the evidence presented there):

""One  Beijing researcher, now in jail, made a million dollars selling his  monkeys and rats on the live animal market, where they eventually wound  up in someone’s stomach.""  


The only things that lean toward being exculpatory of the BSL-4 lab is the reputation of the news source and the byline bio of the author (he seems likely to have an anti-China bias) :

""Steven  W. Mosher is the President of the Population Research Institute and the  author of *Bully of Asia: Why China’s ‘Dream’ is the New Threat to  World Order*.""

5.The article doesn't mention it, but since January, China/the CCP has been **preventing** a team of virologists from the US from going to Wuhan to help/study the virus.

Do these things add up to proof *beyond a reasonable doubt*? No.  A preponderance of the evidence?  Quite possibly.  I haven't seen any good/serious counterarguments yet. 

I'm wondering:   
a.Has it been confirmed that bats were even sold at the seafood market generally named as the source?  

b.Where can I confirm the distance between the market and the lab?

c.Has it been confirmed that a bat could catch and pass on CoV-19?"

[But the Sydney Morning Herald recently revealed that Indonesia had no “specific detection kit” for DNA sequencing to confirm the new type of coronavirus.

Indonesia eventually received the primer on Feb. 4, allowing for an easier detection process.](https://foreignpolicy.com/2020/02/19/indonesia-coronavirus-screening-may-miss-virus-carriers/)   


[The country’s top health official is under increasing pressure to explain why no cases have been reported, especially in light of a recent Harvard University study that used mathematical probabilities including travel destinations to conclude that Indonesia should have had confirmed infections by now. “We owe it to God,” said Health Minister Terawan Agus Putranto, a military doctor and radiologist whose expertise does not include pandemic viruses. “It’s because of our prayers. We do not wish upon something like that will reach Indonesia.”](https://www.scmp.com/week-asia/health-environment/article/3051068/we-owe-it-god-indonesia-prays-how-it-keeping)

I'm not on this sub 24/7. However, today there is only this one article. 1 article among 100s.

> I'm not going to keep going with you, from my perspective you're a waste of time. Google this shit yourself, look at comments yourself.

It was your claim that the comments portrayed ""a manifestation of the imaginary racism that's being reported on blaming white people"". I looked through the comments and found none. 

Honestly, doesn't even sound like you know what the term ""racism"" even means so I wouldn't expect you to keep up. You can't even explain yourself or your position. You make sweeping generalizations and claims that cannot be backed up. 

Moreover, you've used a term, ""Please take your shrieking virtue signalling elsewhere."" that I've heard before and started to notice a trend in that people use this to end a discussion when they can't provide proper/logical reasoning.

Essentially, [this has been Singapore's game plan](https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/coronavirus-covid19-moh-gp-phpc-clinics-subsidised-12435894). 

Singapore is a population dense city-state of around 5 million people, it has around two dozen clinics and hospitals, and as the article above states, around 900 GPs. 

The thing is, the contact tracing efforts are now secondary to that strategy. It's employed, but life in Singapore is still going on as usual, with just yesterday a large profile in with WaPo or NYT about Chinese nationals trying to make a buck.

The ""insurance"" they issued to keep people home? 100 USD a day when the average wage in the country is closer to 200 USD a day. The 'financial buffer' [they are talking about](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/02/21/coronavirus-minister-on-singapores-financial-buffer-to-help-economy.html)? I did the math, it works out to 7-14 days of money for the average Singapore household. 

Singapore has very poor press freedom on top.

So, I look at all the reporting from an outside perspective and I say ""Singapore isn't even taking this as seriously as Japan."" But I am very open to your information, especially any detailed, non-government sources about how they're contact tracing, where they are setting up clinics, etc.

Until then? I maintain that if a large, international team was doing aggressive contact tracing like we're seeing in the ROK, that Singapores numbers would be going up faster."

1 - It’s a touch higher than I’d expect for that sort of accommodation. You’d expect to be in fairly nice accommodation for that price I think. 

2 - Depends on what you cook, but if you’re sourcing your ingredients from Aldi/Lidl then £2-3 is pretty reasonable and easy to do. Tipping isn’t uncommon in the UK but it’s not obligatory/expected. Don’t feel pressured to do it!

3 - Liverpool’s city centre is quite compact so you can certainly get around a lot in 30 minutes. You might want public transport if you’re going outside of the main city I guess? Bikes aren’t overly common in the centre from what I’ve seen. 

4: You’ll never walk alone. But seriously, it’s like a lot of cities in the night. You get some drunk idiots out then but if you use your common sense when out at night you’ll be fine. 

5: Public transport can set you back a bit if you need it- but if you’re going to university and living on campus, you shouldn’t frequently need it. For anything else, you can usually get things pretty cheap if you know where to look. 

6: I think Liverpool is one of the most anti-racist cities in the UK. We have historic ties with China in particular. The Coronavirus outbreak may affect public perception as you say- I’d hope people know better, you might get the odd idiot perhaps.

Hope this helps- obviously I’m just one perspective on our city but I hope you enjoy being here!"

## Is California able to test for the novel coronavirus?

Currently, the CDC is the only laboratory that is doing testing for the novel coronavirus in the United States. **Starting as soon as next week, California will have the ability to test for novel coronavirus in-state at the Public Health Department’s Viral and Rickettsial Disease Laboratory in Richmond and 15 other labs using the same test the CDC uses**. Until now, only the CDC could test for novel coronavirus. This means California public health officials will get test results sooner, so that any patients will get the best care."

CDC stats show 84% of deaths from the flu were people 65 year of age and older.

Coronavirus mortality rates:

>Among those ages 80 and older, the death rate was 14.8%, compared with 8.0% for those ages 70 to 79; 3.6% for those ages 60 to 69; 1.3% for those ages 50 to 59; 0.4% for those ages 40 to 49, and 0.2% for those ages 10 to 39. No deaths have been reported among children from birth to age 9. 

So, yes, the flu has a lower fatality rate..... but to say >People SERIOUSLY need to stop acting as though only elderly people will die, and seriously need to stop comparing it to the flu. It is not the flu.

Both the flu and coronavirus quite clearly kills elderly people waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaay more. 80% and 84% kinda more than people younger than 60-65. No way to possibly deny those comparable stats."

South Korea has reported 556 coronavirus cases, 309 of them associated with the Shincheonji religious group in Daegu, and five deaths.

""We’re now at a watershed moment with the novel coronavirus and the next few days will be very critical,"" Moon said in a televised address. ""We need to identify the infected people as soon as possible and prevent the virus from spreading further.""

""The government will raise the country’s crisis alert level to the highest as recommended by infectious disease experts and will strengthen the national response system.
Most of the tests results for the people who are showing symptoms are expected to come out over the weekend, and after that, we expect the increase in new cases related to the Shincheonji group will slow down. 
These measures are taken to quickly screen and treat infected patients and to prevent the virus from spreading to the regional community by isolating and protecting the patients.
The decision to temporarily shut down the Shincheonji related facilities by the local governments and to conduct surveys on the whole congregation is an inevitable measure to ensure the safety of the local community. 
These are not measures to restrict freedom of religious activities but to protect lives and safety of local residents and citizens. It is also a measure to ensure safety of the Shincheonji members."""

Another takeaway, and this is something anyone who has been around for a while will tell you is that credit card is not the best way to pay TDs. What TDs are doing is illegal, even in China, thus they can’t just go via the usual methods to get credit card processing facilities. They use third parties who a) charge larger than usual fees, b) aren’t known / trusted to the buyer, d) probably aren’t following PCI standards, e) possibly delay money transfer. This leads to people complaining about delays, paying too much for their watch, seeing odd transactions sometimes at a later date.

The average person would think a lot more people became infected and it's spreading. Whilst, from what I've heard, that's not exactly the case. They just changed the ""rules"" of diagnosing, which means more people are diagnosed and quarantined, which means there's a lesser chance of it spreading. There wasn't a huge influx in infected people. People just got diagnosed even when they're not 100% sure whether it's coronavirus, just to be sure.

I'm glad we have several people here pointing out the misconceptions. If I saw this graph a few weeks earlier I would've probably freaked out.

That's allowed cults like this and the Moonies to grow to dangerous levels.

I suppose that if you're ready to believe that the church leader is the messiah, like with this cult, believing the bullshit (more on that [here](https://old.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/f62n7n/korea_just_had_an_overnight_cluster_of_15_new/fi399uo/) that's put out by the far-right isn't too much of a stretch."

Dott Rossaro: coronavirus e vit c

[23/2, 10:03] Luca: I messaggi sulla diffusione del coronavirus, ora anche su WhatsApp, sono molto pericolosi, più che per il virus, per la forza creatrice del nostro pensiero che se diventa collettivo (come lo è già) rafforza l'espandersi della paura. Ma molti non sanno che questo è tutto uno sporco gioco politico e di denaro. Quando uscirà il vaccino le multinazionali si faranno una grande risata e si riempiranno le tasche di soldi. Ma soprattutto, siccome il pensiero è creatore se si alimenta la paura, la paura stessa rende il   sistema immunitario più fragile e attrae ancor di più questo stato di malattia. Invece bisogna creare una scia di forza di guarigione che contrasti questo. I gruppi che conoscono l'energia e l'autoguarigione devono riunirsi e fare meditazioni collettive per contrastare questo pensiero del coronavirus. Mi auguro che chi conosce l'uso dell'energia come autoguarigione si adoperino per aiutare le persone a prendere coscienza coscienza che questi sono giochi manipolativi di potere e vanno assolutamente fermati NON CONDIVISI!!!!
Questo è il messaggio da condividere!!!!!
Avviamo tutti insieme un processo di pulizia e autoguarigione dal coronavirus.
CONDIVIDETE QUESTO MESSAGGIO!!!!"

Flat earthers are generally unwilling to accept the science behind the proof the earth isn’t flat (Netflix documentary behind the curve is quite good).    Flat earthers also seem to be willing to cast aside any argument that it’s not flat - it’s almost as if they know they’re wrong but aren’t willing to admit it.    Nothing about their beliefs are provable.    If they don’t believe in science the flat earth is the least of their problems.

There are active posts right now saying coronavirus isn’t real or is a government creation.   Some border on absurd (in the former’s case),  but I can’t tell you it’s 100% not true.   This is in stark contrast to flat earth.   

Your example of the plane explosion can be confirmed by the many videos at the wtc site.    If people are convinced the explosion happened even with video evidence that isn’t Mandela, and does go into conspiracy theory territory.   

We labeled a memory / understanding issue to explain something that we’ve known forever - we don’t remember things perfectly or the same way from person to person.    There’s nothing scientific about the “majority” who remembers something a certain way.    How do we track and count this majority?   There may be a majority of people who think Benjamin Franklin was a president - is that a lack of knowledge or a labeled “effect”?    Labeling is a slippery slope.    The fact we don’t remember things equally isn’t a new invention, but for some reason we needed to invent a label."

>But the timing is the unlikeliest element of all. The virus was released in a leading transportation hub just prior to Lunar New Year, the absolute worst time from the Chinese perspective. An accidental release timed so perfectly is exceptionally unlikely. By contrast, 300 American military personnel had been visiting Wuhan just two weeks prior to the first cases appearing, almost exactly the point at which the virus probably first appeared. What a remarkable coincidence!

>As someone noted, suppose 300 Chinese military officers were visiting Chicago, and then immediately afterwards a deadly new virus suddenly appeared there out of nowhere, with Chinese people perhaps relatively immune. Would the US consider this a mere coincidence?

>Another highly suspicious element is that so many American “conspiracy” websites began promoting the ridiculous notion of an accidental Chinese release so quickly, almost as if some Intelligence agency were all prepared with that cover story.

> Food establishments in Johor Bahru are reporting a decline in sales of up to 70 per cent.

> JOHOR BAHRU: Food eateries in Johor Bahru that usually see many customers from across the causeway are reeling from a sharp decline in sales, amid fears over the COVID-19 outbreak.

> Restaurants and outlets interviewed by CNA said that the steep drop in business has been evident since Chinese New Year, when Johor reported its first confirmed case of the virus.

> Among the affected businesses is Hiap Joo Bakery & Biscuit Factory, known for its banana cakes. The bakery typically attracts a line of customers outside its doors near Jalan Dhoby.

> Following the outbreak, sales has dipped by at least 50 per cent, said Mr Lim Toh Shin who runs the bakery’s operations.

> “There is usually a long queue for our cakes at 11am every day, but these days, the line will only last for five minutes,” said Mr Lim.

> “We now have excess cakes and are unable to sell all that we bake for the day,” he added.

> ""VIRTUAL GHOST TOWN""

> Mr Lim estimates that Singaporeans typically make up more than half of his total customer base, and the sharp decline recently can be attributed to fewer Singapore visitors.

> “It’s clear because there are markedly fewer visitors on weekends, when most of our customers from Singapore usually come and buy,” he said.

> Meanwhile along the same street, Mr Rahim Khan, operator of Salahuddin Bakery echoed similar sentiments.

> Salahuddin Bakery sells freshly baked curry puffs and French loaves. Mr Khan said that business has slowed down by 40 to 50 per cent recently.

> Salahuddin bakery along Jalan Dhoby, (Photo: Amir Yusof)

> He attributed the fall in sales to people's fear that they might catch the virus if they travel.

> “I can understand the fear. Some of my regular customers from Singapore called and apologised that they are unable to come, but I understand. It would not be worth the journey if they become sick,” he added.

> Both bakeries are located near Jalan Dhoby in downtown Johor Bahru. The area is well known for its hipster cafes, traditional Chinese restaurants and classic bakeries. It is a hotspot for Singaporean visitors.

> But recently, the place has become a “virtual ghost town” said Mr Khan.

> Although the pedestrian walkkway near Jalan Dhoby has been recently expanded, the foot traffic is low because of the spread of the coronavirus. (Photo: Amir Yusof)

> He added: “The virus is definitely to blame. But also, we are suffering now because there has been some construction work to widen pedestrian walkways. This makes it hard for our customers to park”.

> There have been 22 cases of COVID-19 in Malaysia, with 17 people discharged so far.

> LESS CAUSEWAY CONGESTION

> According to media reports, there has been less congestion at the Causeway over the past few weeks.

> On Thursday (Feb 20) evening, the journey from Woodlands Checkpoint to Johor Bahru via the Causeway took around 20 mins, based on what CNA experienced. This peak hour commute usually takes around one to three hours.

> 

> Screenshot from the ""Beat the Jam!"" app showing how travel duration across the Causeway from Singapore to Johor Bahru on Feb 20 is lower overall than the week before.

> The “Beat the Jam!” app, which charts travel duration at the Causeway and Second Link throughout the day, has noted a sharp decrease in movement from Singapore to Johor Bahru, even on weekends.

> Mr Mohd Taufik Mohd Jamal, a Johorean who travels to and fro Singapore for work six times a week, told CNA that the lack of congestion at the Causeway has been a “pleasant surprise”.

> “In my 10 years of travelling back and forth, I’ve never experienced weeks like this where the travel times are less than half an hour,” said the 45-year-old who works in construction.

> Despite that, he expressed hope that things will go back to normal.

> “Many businesses in Johor, including the F&B businesses, are suffering because of the virus. It’s not a healthy situation for Malaysians,” added Mr Mohd Taufik.

> Over at Pandan Wholesale Market, a popular area for Singaporeans to do their groceries and have their meals, the footfall was very low.

> The food courts at the market, popular for Indonesian, Thai and Pakistani cuisine, were empty during dinner time.

> When a stray customer walked by, vendors would approach them and hurriedly hand out their menus.

> This food court near Pandan Wholesale Market has more vendors than customers. (Photo: Amir Yusof)

> Ms Dewi Rudyman, who operates an Indonesian stall, said revenue has dipped by 70 per cent since Chinese New Year.

> “Pandan wholesale market is a bit narrow, and shoppers are forced to walk close to one another,” she said.

> “I heard from my customers claiming it’s not safe to visit now because you never know if there will be a spread of the (coronavirus). So far, there has been no case reported from here though.”

> NO MOOD FOR SEAFOOD

> Seafood restaurants in Johor Bahru are also reporting slow sales.

> A chain of Chinese seafood restaurants at Kampung Telok Jawa, which is popular among Singaporeans, have all seen fewer customers over the last three weeks.

> 

> Seafood restaurants in Johor Bahru - Todak, YX, TKK and Tepi Pantai - are all impacted by the coronavirus. (Photo: Amir Yusof)

> A staff member from Todak Restaurant, who wanted to be known only as Mr Lim, told CNA that some regular customers from Singapore “have no mood” to eat a luxury seafood meal amid the spread of COVID-19.

> 

> “I think customers are scared of getting infected. Maybe the whole mood to sit down and enjoy is not the best right now,” he added.

> The restaurant is popular for its fresh fish, butter squid and salted egg crab. Usually, customers have to wait in line before they are even seated. However, the outlet was only half full when CNA visited on Thursday evening.

> The seats at Todak restaurant facing the Johor Straits were empty. (Photo: Amir Yusof)

> Mr Wilson Tay, a Johorean customer at Todak Restaurant said he is enjoying the smaller crowd while it lasts.

> “There’s no need to queue and it takes a shorter time to process orders. It’s not a bad time to visit,” he said.

I'm assuming that you did not pay a phone bill for 10 years for a number you don't use. Also, if the passport used to open the account has expired, it might not let you do much after that. You might not need to go to the branch where you opened the account - other banks seem to be getting less strict about that, and as an anecdote a friend of mine reactivated an ICBC account in Shanghai last year that he had opened in Beijing about ten years ago. You are almost definitely going to have to do it in person in China though.

I would plan a vacation to China (after the coronavirus settles down), figuring the money you get from the account would be enough to cover it. Take the passport you used to open the account (probably cancelled by now) and your new passport, and any other stuff you have (like the passbook) just in case, and hope that the guy at the counter is helpful. I guess I would first try to update the passport information on the account, then try to update the phone number to one that you can access (even a friend's number if you don't want to get a Chinese number), and have them issue a new bank card (I would ask for one with a new number). Then decide what you want to do - use the money for your vacation, try to convert it into dollars ($500 daily limit, but you can go every day), close the account, etc."

the death rate (for closed case) went from 90% to 10% over a few weeks

secondary, you can't make a vaccine for a type of virus, that not how it work, you can make vaccine for a speicific virus, but not a general type, since the vaccine work by training your body to respond to this virus so it can reckonise it and fight it very quickly when you meet it.

Maybe we'll be able to make a vaccine, maybe we'll not, but ressistance against the virus will build in population and the virus will either die over time or become another season flu"

In addition to meds I'd also dose up on vitamin c as a preventative now and during if you do get sick. stock up on some herbal tea and honey too as its not going to dose you up with caffeen and make you restless and irritable. Instead it is a soothing hot drink that will help you to at least rest/stay comfortable and keep hydrated. I also recommend sipping peppermint oil in warm/room temperature (not boiling) water a few times a day, it works for me and has done during full blown flu, vomiting bugs and colds alike.

We don't really know enough at this point about the specific Covid-19 strain to say anything more. They are using HIV meds in a medical setting to treat patients with some success but they aren't available to the public and shouldn't be messed around with by anyone who doesn't know what they are doing. 

I'm also taking elderberry suppliments as they contain a lot of vitamin c and are alleged to be antiviral with some noted clinical success against viruses of the coronavirus family. I've had medical professionals say that elderberry is just a 'snake oil' suggestion, then again look where antibiotics have gotten us so for me it's worth a shot, at least it won't do any harm. 
I'm also taking oregano oil, a natural antibiotic to keep away bacterial colds. But I'd be taking both anyway during heightened cold and flu seasons regardless of Covid-19."

> SINGAPORE: The mood at Grace Assembly of God was jubilant a few weeks ago, judging by the posts on the church's Facebook page as it prepared to celebrate its 70th anniversary.

> When cases of the new coronavirus were reported in Singapore in end-January, there were social media reminders for people who felt unwell to rest at home. Some face-to-face sessions were halted as a precaution.

> Advertisement

> Advertisement

> About a week before the anniversary celebrations, the church implemented mandatory temperature taking for children and youth services, encouraged ""no hand shaking"" and increased frequency of cleaning.

> In the weekend of Feb 8, the church marked the launch of its 70th year celebrations by live-streaming a joyous service live from its Tanglin branch.

> Advertisement

> Advertisement

> It was largely business-as-usual.

> 

> THE FIRST CASES

> 

> However, on Feb 12, the mood dipped. The Ministry of Health (MOH) had just announced two confirmed cases of COVID-19: Church employees who had been to the Bukit Batok and Tanglin branches of the church before they were diagnosed.

> Grace Assembly of God church Bukit Batok branch. (Photo: Try Sutrisno Foo)

> That day, the church announced on Facebook that services and other activities were being suspended for two weeks.

> It soon came to light that one of the first few employees infected was senior pastor Wilson Teo, who wrote a note to members of the church.

> “I am sorry for adding another concern to you with this news,” he wrote. “Please rest assured that I am recovering well. I am looking forward to my full recovery, when I will share with all of you on Grace Assembly's journey in overcoming this virus.""

> Screengrab of the letter written by senior pastor of Grace Assembly of God Wilson Teo.

> The other employee also diagnosed with COVID-19, who is referred to by MOH as case 48, spoke to CNA about his experience.

> He cannot be named, in accordance to MOH's practice of keeping the identity of cases confidential.

> Discharged on Feb 17, the patient said in an interview with CNA that he was ""left speechless"" by the diagnosis.

> “I felt unsettled and uncertain of what to expect,” he said. He said his faith kept him optimistic and he gained solace in knowing that there were many people praying for him and his family.

> “There was also a sense of guilt because of the possible risks that my family would be exposed to, both from catching the virus from me and the possibility of being stigmatised by being linked to a confirmed case.”

> GROWING CLUSTER

> View of Grace Assembly of God, Tanglin. (Photo: Try Sutrisno Foo)

> Meanwhile, the Grace Assembly of God church virus cluster continued to balloon and make the headlines. The number of infections connected to the cluster is 23, compared to the range of three to nine cases in the other four clusters identified here.

> 

> The day after the first two cases were announced, five more confirmed cases were linked to the church.

> On Feb 13, six more cases from the cluster were confirmed, then three more, then two more.

> There were no new cases on Feb 17, but the next day, three were announced. Another case linked to the church was announced on Saturday.

> Based on MOH’s updates, four of the cases linked to the church reported symptoms on Feb 8 and Feb 9.

> SUPPORT FROM THE COMMUNITY

> 

> Within two days of the first announcement by MOH, the church had shared on its Facebook page a blog post written by one of its members about coping with the church being a cluster, accompanied by an appeal to pray and not panic.

> Case 48 recounted how he never felt alone , despite being housed in an isolation ward.

> 

> “My mobile was buzzing and ringing off the hook. My family, friends, my team and my leaders checked in and prayed constantly for me, and kept encouraging me throughout my stay in NCID,” he said, adding that he also stayed in touch with other church members through e-meetings.

> Other churches also reached out, said the patient. People delivered food, groceries and care packages to those on Home Quarantine Order. The church had said in a Facebook post that its entire staff had been served with the orders.

> Case 48 said it was ""heart-wrenching"" to see the number of cases linked to the church rise, but that the church remained sure that the ""dark cloud"" would pass.

> “This virus can be contracted by anyone regardless of nationality, religion, race or age. I think the key thing is to observe good personal hygiene and adhere to the necessary precautions,” he said.

> On Feb 14, MOH said in its daily update that a 28-year-old man linked to the church tested positive for the virus. While he, case 66, appeared to have caught the infection later than others, the man had in fact reported symptoms on Jan 29, the earliest in the cluster. He has been discharged. On Saturday, MOH announced that the latest case linked to the church, case 88, is a contact of case 66.

> But even as more cases linked to the cluster have been diagnosed, so has the number of people who have recovered.

> On Friday, MOH announced that four patients connected to the Church had been discharged, bringing the total to six. Among them was senior pastor Teo.

> In a message on the church's website, he said that a test that showed he was negative for COVID-19 was a ""wonderful piece of news"". After a second, definitive test, a doctor informed him that he was a ""COVID-19 survivor"".

> ""I could go home to hug my family,"" he said.

> Meanwhile, when asked if he knew how the virus could have spread within the church, case 48 said not everyone linked to the cluster was a staff member or congregant of the church.

> “I do not wish to speculate when, where or how I or any of those cases linked to our church, could have gotten the virus,” he said.

> “As a Christian, my faith in God has kept me calm and encouraged me throughout this episode. I am also confident of Singapore's robust healthcare system and that the doctors will do what's right and necessary.”

è la storia della tipa/il tipo che rimane scottata/o e diventa acida/o.

visto che ultimamente (storicamente parlando) in nome della scienza e delle credenze popolari (religione) si è fatto l'indicibile, la reazione naturale è ripudiare il tutto, la disintossicazione completa modello drogato in riabilitazione.

parla con chiunque e chiunque ti dirà che siamo tutti uguali, che tutte le religioni sono uguali, che maschi e femmine sono uguali, e che la moralità è roba da vecchi e via dicendo.

eppure non siamo uguali manco per niente, tutte le persone sono diverse, al massimo accomunabili per qualche tratto genetico o culturale.

si è razzisti nel momento in cui si discrimina un diritto in base a un motivo non rilevante basato su diffidenza immotivata (e bada, deve essere immotivata, perché non escludo che in certi casi possa essere motivata), ad esempio non assumere un cameriere perché è induista, non perché si rileva che un messicano ha un insieme di credenze ed esperienze diverse da un norvegese.

però il limite è molto sottile, e quindi mi pare mediamente normale che sia molto più semplice il ragionamento: ""siamo tutti uguali, e se non ci credi sei razzista"", così come il bambino non si sofferma a pensare che se non toccasse il fuoco non si scotterebbe, così come la tipa/il tipo che fa sempre gli stessi errori nella vita sentimentale alla fine fa di tutta l'erba un fascio.

e siccome mediamente si ragiona così (o per lo meno i pochi a cui sta davvero a cuore il discorso, perché alla maggior parte delle persone, diciamocelo, non gliene frega niente e ha comunque e sempre avrà il suo razzismo di fondo, come è naturale che sia), va da sé che certe scelte politiche vengano mascherate dal politicamente corretto (vedi situazione migranti e quarantena coronavirus)"

There was some quite recent and serious academical science study on such phenomenon, called antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) of viral entry for coronaviruses.  Of course it was not done having any SARS 2.0 specimens yet, but this is absolutely real possibility to consider:

> ADE has been observed for coronaviruses. Several studies have shown that sera induced by SARS-CoV spike enhance viral entry into Fc-receptor-expressing cells. Further, one study demonstrated that unlike receptor-dependent viral entry, sera dependent SARS-CoV entry does not go through the endosome pathway.

Description|Corona Virus pranks are the coolest internet trend today. Because nothing is funnier than frightening the public and exploiting their fears. In this video I look at excellent content creators like riceman and Kmoorethegoat, who are pioneers in this wacky new prank.

Currently, passengers from China, Hong Kong, Thailand, South Korea, Singapore and Japan are screened at 21 designated airports in the country for possible exposure to the COVID-19.
The decision was taken during a review meeting chaired by the Cabinet Secretary to take stock of the status, actions taken and preparedness of states and UTs regarding the management of novel coronavirus. 
Secretaries of ministries of Health, Civil Aviation, Defence, Information and Broadcasting, DG AFMS and representatives from External Affairs Ministry, Home Affairs Ministry, Bureau of Immigration, ITBP and Army were also present at the meeting."

*Parts of Iran face lockdown in a bid to control the spread of coronavirus that has now claimed eight lives, and led to 43 infections in the country.*

*“If the situation gets any worse city staff will be expected to convert to teleworkers,” said Pirouz Hanachi, the mayor of Tehran, Iran’s capital.*  


*Government authorities have also been fighting an information war amid widespread distrust on social media about whether the public is being told the truth about the scale of the outbreak.*

*Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei claimed Iran’s enemies were spreading mistrust, and even said the low turnout in Iran’s parliamentary elections on Friday was due to western scare stories.*

*The coronavirus outbreak had claimed its first victim in the religious city of Qom last Wednesday about an hour’s drive from Tehran, the first death in the Middle East*  


*The numbers of people on Tehran’s streets has been noticeably lower, with many shops shut and facemasks in short supply and increasingly expensive.*

*In Tehran and 13 other affected provinces, the authorities have introduced increasingly drastic “preventive measures” including the closure of schools, universities, cinemas and theatres. Public buses in Tehran could also be seen being disinfected, and posters were being put up urging people to clean, and not shake hands.*

*The school system is being shut for a minimum of two days starting Sunday to allow for disinfection spraying.*

*There was also widespread advice to stay home and avoid places where people congregate. Some football matches were cancelled. Metro stations were not shut, but water fountains and shops were all being closed. The council said they were also taking new steps to dispose of waste.*

*At the airport roughly a third of passengers were wearing facemasks, but there were no special controls on people leaving the country. Turkey, Iraq and Pakistan have either closed borders or are imposing extra health checks.*

*Some of the families of those that have died in Qom claim to know of no contact with anyone in China prompting claims that this might be an indigenous disease. The minister for health Saeed Saltaki denied this saying one victim traded in China, and had travelled there indirectly. The strain discovered in Iran matched that in China he said.*

*He has recommended no travel to or from Qom, as well as promising to distribute free coronavirus packages to residents in the area, including masks and educational brochures.*"

I'm not only concerned about getting this coronavirus, but do definitely not want to get any kind of cold or other diseases from movie theatre. When you have common cold, influenza or something and know about it, you just do not go to public places unnecessarily. If you are asymptomatic and not tested nobody can blame you, there is a difference."

This is influenza with worse symptoms, still mainly effects people of the same age group as the flue but with a higher lethality rate. We also don’t have any vaccine for it at all, we do for the flu, this is a much more difficult problem to solve than the seasonal flu. There’s also the fact of its location being China, which aside from being very densely populated is also close to relatively poor nations such as India that this could be really bad for. Dense populations mean more opportunities for the virus to mutate which makes it harder to treat also. Currently this coronavirus is worse than the flu."

> SINGAPORE - There are no new cases of the coronavirus disease, said the Health Ministry (MOH) on Sunday (Feb 23), meaning that the total number stays at 89.

> Two more have been discharged, which means a total of 51 have fully recovered and been discharged from hospital since the first case was confirmed a month ago, on Jan 23.

> Most of the 38 confirmed cases who are still hospitalised are stable or improving. Five are in critical condition in the intensive care unit.

> As of noon on Sunday, MOH has identified 2,812 close contacts, with 908 currently quarantined. Another 1,904 have completed their quarantine.

> The Grace Assembly of God remains the largest cluster.

> Other clusters so far are the Life Church and Missions Singapore, the Yong Thai Hang health products shop, the Grand Hyatt Singapore and a Seletar Aerospace Heights construction site.

> When asked on Friday, health officials did not comment on whether Singapore would be lowering its disease outbreak status to yellow given that more than half the total cases have recovered.

> Singapore's Disease Outbreak Response System Condition (Dorscon) level has been at orange for two weeks, since Feb 7.

> Orange means the disease is severe with transmission, but is generally contained, and has moderate to high public health impact.

> Yellow refers either to a mild infection, or a severe infection that is not spreading here, but about which the community needs to be careful.

It's killed no infants aged 0-9, and it has a .2% mortality rate from age 10-39, .4% from 40-49, 1.3% from 50-59. The math very clearly shows it's not a fatal illness for anyone that's not elderly.

Because in china there are 77k infected and 11k require intensive care(that's 1/7, 14%). What you are probably referring to is mechanical ventilation which is different from ICU. It is preserved for people with worse condition named ""critical"". Survival rate among critical cases is very low

""The coronavirus pneumonia produces mild cold symptoms in about 80% of patients, Dr. Sylvie Briand, head of WHO’s Global Infectious Hazard Preparedness division, told reporters Monday. About 15% of the people who contract the virus have ended up with pneumonia with 3% to 5% of all patients needing intensive care, she said""

https://www.cnbc.com/2020/02/11/world-health-organization-names-the-new-coronavirus-covid-19.html

I'm going to trust her word over whatever sources you use.

>>The death rate is lower than that, perhaps even below 1%

>That is straight up lie.

>2443 people have lost their lives in china with 77k confirmed cases. That is 3.17% mortality rate and it will keep increasing to probably about 5-7% because it takes about a month for the infection to resolve.

I did not lie, I based that claim on the above 3-5% numbers. If only that number needs ""intensive care"" I doubt that a substantial % of them die. I can't know for certain it's below 1%, but I think with such low % of people needing intensive care, it's a fair guesstimate. And again, I trust WHO numbers over your napkin-math.

>>which is only made greater the more scared we all are

>that's not how that works.

Are you saying that the economy isn't affected by how much people panic over this? Because it is indeed a factor. That's how that works.

>Spanish flu was in 1914-18. If this disease was back then, it probably would have 30-50% mortality rate. We have modern medicine now helping people recover. This comparison is an ignorant one.

More numbers taken from thin air. But you're exactly right - we have modern medicine now, so I'm not particularly worried about coronavirus whatso*ever*. Did you suddenly see the light and agree with me?

>I can guarantee you if these people didn't have treatment the mortality rate would be above 50% aswell. Again, an ignorant statement.

Again, a bold claim without a shadow of sources. I try to rely on facts myself - I find that I panic unnecessarily less often.

>Seasonal flu also infects billions of people and has a very low mortality rate and severity rate. Flu has 1.8% hospitalization rate while according to hubei's numbers COVID requires 70% hospitalization rate.

Is a pandemic really much to worry about if it doesn't ultimately kill more than seasonal flu (again, apart from economic issues stemming in part from overly panicky people)? Isn't the main concern in pandemics that we or someone we love, you know, die? I'll have to know maybe a hundred infected people to know 1 that died. While any death is tragic, I don't see cause for concern.

>Absolutely, for sure the chinese would hype the virus up and tank their economy just for media hype. /s

And China is the only one talking about it and hyping it up. You're literally Chinese yourself, yup. /s

>I hope this pandemic ends soon so that neither you nor your family has to suffer but if it doesn't, remember what you said here.

I'm a travel agent. I live and die by people trusting me to plan their dream vavations. My company always offers to insure vacations for a modest fee but most people click through thinking they'll never need to cancel. 

For whatever reason I'm particularly known in my town for organizing trips to a certain region of the world that recently had a spoke in Coronavirus / COVID19 cases. 

Unsurprisingly a bunch of folks have called me up asking for refunds. I've gladly refunded all those who paid for the insurance but told everyone else they're out of luck since their flights and accomodations are still usable. (Obviously if flights get cancelled it's a different story) 

I thought this would be straightforwars but I've been repeatedly accosted on the street by people telling me I'm greedy and trying to either take their money or get their families sick. I didnt think I did anything wrong — it's what they agreed to when they paid for the trips — but after hearing from practically half the neighborhood I'm not so sure. Am I the asshole?

 El decreto ley, firmado cuando la tercera economía de la eurozona [ya contabiliza dos muertes por este virus](//elpais.com/sociedad/2020/02/22/actualidad/1582407209_030106.html), obliga a los residentes en dichas áreas a permanecer en ellas hasta nuevo aviso (que en ningún caso llegará antes de dos semanas). Los afectados tendrán la baja laboral y deberán circunscribir sus movimientos a asuntos de primera necesidad. Algo que hasta ahora no todo el mundo estaba cumpliendo, tal y como el primer ministro detalló en la rueda de prensa. Todo eso, además, bajo la amenaza de sanciones: esa normativa tendrá consecuencias penales para quien no la respete y abandone las zonas de aislamiento, en Lombardía (10 municipios) y Véneto (uno), que afectan en conjunto a unas 50.000 personas.

 ""No se permitirá la entrada y la salida [de las localidades situadas en los focos de contagio], salvo excepciones específicas que se evalúen periódicamente"", ha subrayado a medianoche, tras más de seis horas de reunión con su Gabinete. ""El objetivo es proteger la salud de los italianos; el bienestar de los ciudadanos ocupa el primer lugar de nuestros valores constitucionales"", ha señalado. El decreto, aprobado de urgencia este sábado, también afectará a los más jóvenes: las medidas aprobadas permiten la suspensión de viajes educativos de escuelas, tanto en el interior de Italia como en el extranjero.

 Italia es ya el país europeo con [mayor número de contagiados por el Covid-19](//elpais.com/sociedad/2020/02/22/actualidad/1582371509_727652.html). Para hacer cumplir con todas las medidas propuestas por el decreto ley, Conte ha dicho que contará incluso con la intervención de la policía. ""Obviamente tendremos controles [para que se respeten las medidas]. Ya hemos dado un mandato a la policía y, si es necesario, activaremos a las Fuerzas Armadas. Pero tenemos mucha confianza en la colaboración de los ciudadanos"", ha explicado el primer ministro.

 En la citada reunión de urgencia, también se ha tratado la gestión fronteriza ya que varias regiones que cuentan con casos de contagio del Covid-19 —Piamonte, Lombardía y Véneto— lindan con otros socios de la UE. Pese a que también se han detectado casos en Emilia-Romaña y Roma, según los medios italianos, los focos de contagio están más al norte. Por el momento, según anunció Conte, ""no se pondrán en marcha medidas para solicitar la suspensión del Tratado de Schengen y, en particular, la libre circulación de personas"". En plata: no habrá controles fronterizos, al menos por el momento. El primer ministro, además, ha anunciado que en los próximos días el Gobierno aprobará un segundo decreto con varios subsidios y medidas para compensar y remediar las [dificultades económicas derivadas de esta crisis](//elpais.com/economia/2020/02/21/actualidad/1582308700_524581.html)."

In no way shape or form should anyone feel safer from the virus in Taiwan than the US. Taiwan has among the highest incidences of the coronavirus in the world, especially when considered on a per capita basis. Additionally, their geographic location means they have and will continue to receive tons of people who have been to higher risk areas.. yes, a lot of good actions are being taken... because they have to be taken, because Taiwan’s situation is not sure or safe."

I think I will cancel it. I followed coronavirus cases and saw Italy only had 3 for the whole past month. On Friday I see they jumped up to 50 and I knew the shit hit the fun.

Now it is a spiral out of control effect. Cases will be going up by maybe even 100s for next few weeks.

Pray for Italy."

Description|Covid-19 – Coronavirus, Day 42: More than 1100 dead and 46,000 people infected, Cruise ships quarantined, armed forces mobilised. The speed of the virus, led by the person to person infection, grips the world. Cases are being found in countries all over the globe but with a two week incubation… Is Mankind too late already?⤶⤶Illness and disease have wiped out families and tribes since the beginning of humankind.  Contagious diseases such as Small Pox, Measles, Black Death, Spanish Flu and SARS have devastated communities, from Native Americans, isolated tribes in the rainforests of the Amazon to today's population. We delve into history to understand the scope, and fear, an outbreak can create. And where does the Wuhan Institute of Virology fit into this mysterious outbreak?⤶⤶About Dark Lounge: ⤶⤶Life is often perceived as black or white, fact or fiction, but it can be so much darker… So sit back, tune in and enter ‘the dark lounge' as we explore the grey areas of mysteries, murder, the occult and science fiction.⤶⤶WARNING – Not suitable for children.⤶⤶Twitter: https://twitter.com/darklounge_⤶Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/darklounge_/⤶Music: CO.AG Music: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCcavSftXHgxLBWwLDm_bNvA ⤶⤶Email: darklounge@outlook.com

I’ve been told about the pre-HIV days by older nurses. Who were told not to “waste gloves” while cleaning up blood and body fluids. Now we use universal precautions for all patients....blood and body fluids are assumed to be infectious and staff are protected as if they are. A blood splatter is treated as if it is an HIV exposure until proven otherwise. I know it will be a nightmare to enforce during flu season, but I believe the time has come to apply universal precautions for all patients with respiratory or flu symptoms. Assume they have coronavirus until proven otherwise. Isolate patients, protect staff with appropriate PPE, and increase public education that hospital mild symptoms do not warrant an ER visit. Develop response teams that can assess and test patients in their homes. The Italy and Iran cases are a clear warning about what happens when you wait until an outbreak is established before implementing appropriate measures."

Semplicemente in un primo momento i casi individuati sono talmente pochi che pochi soggetti gravi possono far pensare che la malattia sia molto più grave di quanto non è realmente.

These are estimates though. Official counts are significantly lower. Plus estimates after the pandemic is already over tend to be higher than during the pandemic since after the pandemic is already over, you have a much clearer picture of how big it might have been. While during the early stages of a pandemic, you don't. 

Especially for coronavirus where 80% of the cases are estimated to be asymptomatic, or basically not be any different compared to the regular cold. However they still spread the virus and thus are still very important numbers. Just that we don't know them because most of them will be mistaken for a regular cold, the flu or sth similar. Coronavirus is ""stealthy"" in its early stages which makes detection incredibly hard and will cause many more people to get infected.

Plus, the R0 of coronavirus is estimated to be 4.7 to 6.6, far higher than the R0 of any flu. The flu just has an R0 of 1.3 in comparison. I think it's pretty apparent based on data that coronavirus spreads faster than the swine flu and has a higher mortality rate as well. Take into consideration that the vast majority of countries in the world barely test at all and the numbers are heavily skewed. The situation in other European countries most certainly is similar to Italy, just that they haven't noticed yet, because they don't test. 

Several confirmed patients have travelled to Indonesia yet they barely test at all and their government boasts about how they don't have any infected. But it's unsurprising that if you don't test for a disease, you can't find any infected people. They will just be mistaken for the flu and regular pneumonia. 

The same goes for many countries. Iran literally started testing way too late and probably has thousands of infected by now since they have at least 8 deaths by now and a Canadian woman got infected after visiting Iran. North Korea denies having any infected yet we all know they either probably lie or kill everyone who is infected. Not even forgetting to mention that the number of infected people in China is most certainly in the low millions already, just that most of them are undetected.

Fact is, we currently have no idea how far spread it is. Most likely even the estimates of experts are just scratching the surface. If we were to go by estimates though just like you did for the swine flu, the cases of coronavirus most certainly far outweigh the cases of swine flu around the same time."

Also plenty of water. Also be prepared for tour dates to be moved if not straight out cancelled in the upcomming weeks. Like Ive been sayin in all my previous coments that have been deleted over the past weeks, this is a serious issue that will get worse before it gets better. 
This virus is highly contagious. The methods to detect it are currently spotty at best. Many false negatives. Its also possible to spread without symptoms. Its also looking like incubation period can be as long as 19 days if not longer. The main complication from it is pnemonia.  The reason this is potentially a global disaster is for a couple of things.
1. No heard immunity. This is highly contagious because this is a brand new strain that noone has ever gotten. As a result there atent people with the the right antiboddies to work as a buffer zone to slow it down.
2. The risk of pnemonia is too high. We can treat pnenomia yes, the problem is toed to reason 1. If too many people start getting sick at the same time, which is highly possible since again people dont have heard immunity, its super easy to overwhelm hospitals.
3. The normal flu is not more dangerious. People keep pointing to the fact that the flu has killed more people this year. Well duh thats people this coronavirus hasnt gone global yet. If it did its death rate would obviously be much higher. While we probably wont know the true death rate of this until we have much more date if the current rate of about 2 percent is close, I personally thinknits closer to 10 than 2 myself but lets say if, that is still way worse than hour average flu by almosy 200 percent. 
And none of these things talk about the economic problems we will be sewing in the bext few months even if it doesnt continue to spread. Seriously we need a megathread on this topic here. Anyways if anyone wants more info or links to evidence backing my claims feel free to reply."
2020-02-23,Milk_moustache,CysticFibrosis,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/CysticFibrosis/comments/f8apix/wearing_a_mask_update/fik5ovj/,"You need to see a social worker if you’re in the UK which can be organised by your cf team, or get your concerns met to your doctors when you’re in overnight and your parents can’t micromanage your treatment and your life. (Maybe even bring it up in an outpatients review) Perhaps they can all sit together with you and you can finally address the issues you’re facing together. 

As for wearing a mask, absolutely a necessity if you feel the need. N95 are the anti pollution masks being worn at the moment for coronavirus and you can pick them up fairly cheaply in hardware stores or pharmacies, get something that pinches on the nose. They’re becoming more common and if you’re embarrassed just scare other people into wearing them too.

Also if you’re not, consider taking probiotics for a month or so. Talk to your consultant about this. The optibac travel probiotics are £20 from the pharmacy and they contain the 3 main probiotics needed for gut bacteria. These help my condition and they’re not vital to remember, so I can forget a few doses and continue the next time I remember and I’ve noticed a massive difference in gut health since.

I spent 2 months in Paris last year and got sick toward the end because of the public transport. I get black snot in my nose and a lot of mucus from just being in London for 2 days that I’ve even reduced the amount of work I take there."

Sure, he might run up the score enough in New York and California. He would probably be even money to win the popular vote. However, educated and quasi-conservative men in the suburbs of Wisconsin will decide this election. Many of them know that the president is an unhinged bullshit artist. Many of them have never voted blue. Many of them would vote for *any* other Democratic candidate.

It is a coronavirus that we just discovered in (Nov?Dec?) and are still learning about. 

When it was discovered there were no testing kits. We didn’t know (and still are not sure) how quickly it spreads, it’s incubation period (still under discussion/discovery) and how to treat it.

This is where the real danger is, overwhelmed hospitals, resulting in a greater rate of deaths as not all ill people (and not only coronavictims) will be able to get care.

Collateral events will result in closed schools, workplaces, quarantined cities resulting in a severe blow to the economy, which could result in disrupted supply chains causing shortages of necessary goods and medications.

As you are young and healthy, you personally have no need to fear the infection, however currently it is estimated that the coronavirus is 20x deadlier than the seasonal influenza, and (i don't remember the number) a lot more contagious.

China doesn't really have this, either. What China has, as any laowai will tell you, is a culture of *not being seen breaking rules by people who could punish you for it*. Rule-breaking is extremely widespread, particularly by officials, for whom it's far more important that they not get dinged on numbers. [At the risk of tooting my own horn, here's my post reviewing a biography of Deng Xiaoping](https://www.reddit.com/r/slatestarcodex/comments/dud8zi/book_review_deng_xiaoping_and_the_transformation/) that has a section (""Target Practice"") that goes a bit into the details of this. In short, you have a (quite literally) deadly combination in play here: the people tasked with measuring and reporting coronavirus numbers are the same people who will be rewarded or punished based on those numbers. That is why the number of reported cases has been rising at the same mysteriously constant rate for weeks, and why the criteria for ""has coronavirus"" have become so strict that hospitals are just turning away patients.

2020-02-23,magenta_placenta,conspiracy,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/f8c1q8/new_chinese_study_indicates_novel_coronavirus_did/fikb7qj/,"According to the brand new study by Chinese researchers [published on Feb 21](http://www.chinaxiv.org/abs/202002.00033),  the novel coronavirus may have begun human-to-human transmission in late November from a place other than the Huanan seafood market in Wuhan. Of course, we already knew that, but what is critical is that until now, Beijing was adamant in sticking to the official narrative that it was the Huanan seafood market in Wuhan where the disease emerged, despite not providing any information on what animal was the vector, or who was patient zero.

The study believes that patient zero - who has not yet been identified, and whose identity holds the key to unraveling the mystery of the coronavirus source - transmitted the virus to workers or sellers at the Huanan seafood market. The crowded market facilitated the further transmission of the virus to buyers, which caused a wider spread in early December 2019. According to the researchers, the new coronavirus experienced two sudden population expansions, including one on January 6, 2020, which was related to the Chinese New Year's Day holiday.

And so as one narrative ends, the narrative that the virus emerged in the Wuhan Institute of Virology officially begins."

All it says is the virus wasn't created in the market, it was just disseminated there, and it came in from an animal vector before jumping to humans.

The best working theory is that it originated from bat beta coronavirus, and was introduced to the market through another animal vector.

This is what this says.

2020-02-23,sadbpdcat,CrohnsDisease,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/CrohnsDisease/comments/f88dki/coronavirus_again/fikavhg/,"I'm from Singapore and there have been quite a few cases (89 at this point) here and I've been following the news very closely as well. When the virus first started spreading here, I spoke to my doctors about postponing my Remicade infusion for a while. They were adamantly against it, and mind you, I receive my infusion at the very hospital where there are patients with the virus being isolated. There was also a case of a hospital worker in that particular hospital who had the virus.

We are at a higher risk of complications developing if we get the virus. Also, please remember, that unlike the flu, there is no vaccine for covid-19 at this point. So there is reason to be careful.

Unfortunately, this is par for the course of having a disease like this. If we stop our treatment, we might get worse, and even if we don't get worse, there's a very high chance that we'll develop antibodies to the biologic. Once you develop antibodies, it's difficult to go back on the medication ever again, and we already don't have that many treatment options as it is.

So that's the negative side. The positive side for us is this: those who become critically ill are usually the elderly and those with pre-existing conditions. However, there have been cases of healthy, young people becoming critically ill and dying as well. That's because their immune system attacks the virus too strongly and damages their organs. So, in a sense, we may not have that response.

It's a complicated situation. We're a high-risk group since the virus relies on your immune system to fight it off. But every now and then, the immune system becomes overactive, and that can kill you as well, we're probably safe from that.

P.s. I have my infusion tmr!!

For ARDS:

Oxygenation (adults):

• Mild ARDS: 200 mmHg < PaO 2 /FiO 2 ≤ 300 mmHg (with PEEP or CPAP ≥5 cmH 2 O, 7 or non-ventilated8 )

• Moderate ARDS: 100 mmHg < PaO 2 /FiO 2 ≤200 mmHg with PEEP ≥5 cmH 2 O, 7 or non-ventilated8 )

• Severe ARDS: PaO 2 /FiO 2 ≤ 100 mmHg with PEEP ≥5 cmH 2 O, 7 or non-ventilated8 )

• When PaO 2 is not available, SpO 2 /FiO 2 ≤315 suggests ARDS (including in non-ventilated patients)

Link: https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/clinical-management-of-novel-cov.pdf

2. For general pneumonia (CAP), the severity scores are well known: PSI (best, but a little complex), CURB-65 (easy), CORB (no blood  tests needed), or SMARTCOP. Calculating the PSI in the ER would be a reasonable thing to do, particularly as you won’t know at that stage whether it’s COVID-19 or “normal” pneumonia.

No basic facemask can't protect you from getting this virus. These particulate matter (PM) are around 0.05 to 0.2 microns. Some used by hospitals might help (it can go down to 0.1 micron).

He started by laying out why they get reported by each different network. Giving us an outlook into which news outlets are privately and publicly owned within Canada and the states and how they have the opportunity to put out a better story BUT with the opportunity for more biased based on a situation cause they’re funded in tax dollars. Whereas the private ones really need to make money possibly leading them to getting out a story as fast as possible, such as in Kobe Bryant’s death, all 4 of his daughters were reported dead, other lakers players aswell, all because people wanted to get the scoop. 

He related this to the mike Pompeo scandal where a journalist was revoked a pass onto Air Force one, instead of standing with their colleague and respecting their profession they all boarded to get the scoop, because of trumps words “why do we need the NPR.” Very controversial since there’s freedom of the press.

In view of the evolution of coronavirus disease cases in Italy, in areas where many Romanian citizens are staying or traveling, the Ministry of Health informs that persons arriving in Romania from affected localities in the Veneto region and in the province of Lodi / Lombardy, will have to stay, after entering the country, under quarantine conditions for 14 days. These measures will also be applied to those who have traveled to these localities in the last 14 days and arrive in Romania.

 These measures will also be applied to those arriving in Suceava with the three direct flights from Italy, Milan - Bergamo, Rome and Bologna. On Sunday, the director of the Directorate of Public Health Suceava, Silvia Boliacu, said that when landing at the airport in Suceava, all the planes that come with passengers directly from Italy will be present a doctor from this institution to do the passenger triage. ""In addition to the airport assistant, our doctor will also be present for the triage. It is important that everyone who arrives in Suceava from the areas where there have been coronavirus cases to report this at the airport, ”said Silvia Boliacu. She showed that all passengers coming from the two regions of Italy will be quarantined for 14 days.

At the same time, the director of Suceava Airport, Ioan Măriuța, said, in turn, that he requested that each disinfection of the airport be made after each landing. ""We have information materials received from the DSP, but also a sound support, in Romanian and English, whereby passengers are advised to declare if there are areas where there have been cases of coronavirus,"" said Ioan Măriuța.

 

· Romania is exposed to cases of infection with the new coronavirus

The Ministry of Health informs that so far, no cases of symptomatic Romanian citizens with the new coronavirus have been reported by the Italian authorities.

However, Romania could be more exposed to cases of infection with the new coronavirus, due to the dynamics of travel of Romanian citizens on the land and air routes between the two countries.

The new measures will be transmitted by the Ministry of Health to the health units and family doctors, through the public health departments of the county and of the municipality of Bucharest.

""Measures to control and prevent infection with the new coronavirus will be supplemented at land, sea / river and air border points. The Ministry of Health will provide the necessary medical personnel at the border crossing points, with specialists from the public health departments, including by posting from other counties and health units. All persons who fall within the definition of a suspicious case will be immediately reported by all the health units where they are presented (emergency units, hospitals, family doctors) to the public health departments and to the Monitoring Service within the DSU ”, informs the relevant ministry.

These days, the Ministry of Health will complete the legislative framework with necessary measures for quarantine and the management of suspected and confirmed cases of coronavirus infection (COVID-19).

The information campaign of the population on the infection with the new coronavirus will be extended, the individual and collective prevention measures to be taken and a daily information bulletin will be elaborated regarding the evolution of the situation at international level and any additional measures taken by the Romanian authorities."

it also worries many that it can strike right away after recovery, like dengue in the tropical regions. and the second time is worst so if not properly contain, people could recover from it just to get sick and sicker again.

I was just relaying what I’ve seen many other people say about why we see trending hashtags that are intentionally misspelled with a new/different misspelling every 24-48 hour period. I’ve witnessed this since before the current outbreak with other hashtags topics. So the specific thing I described, whatever the answer may be, appears to not be exclusive to this virus but to all trending hashtags.

Now, does that mean social media and mainstream media aren’t censoring coronavirus discussion in other ways? Absolutely not, we already know as fact that The WHO are directly working with social media platforms to “combat misinformation”. I whole heartedly agree that they are censoring info and discussion, which explains why most of society doesn’t give a damn about the outbreak or even know about it, as opposed to the media frenzy during SARS or H1N1 outbreaks."

> And just how many “microbiology labs” are there in China that handle “advanced viruses like the novel coronavirus”?

> It turns out that in all of China there is only one. And this one is located in the Chinese city of Wuhan that just happens to be . . . the epicenter of the epidemic.

Whether it's a case of sabotage (Russia claims the US did it) or negligence, it seems China has a problem with safety standards such as containing deadly pathogens. We don't know what could escape next.

If you really want to reach for your tin foil hat, consider that the virus is killing off mostly the elderly. In about ten or so years, China's aging population is going to retire and need state pensions to keep them alive. Except, due to the one child policy, there won't be enough workers to pay taxes for their pensions. Governments bank on the pension of the previous generation to be paid by the current one. If only there was a way to limit that aging population so someone who might be the leader in ten years won't face an angry mob when he can't afford to pay them..."

Some things must come from China but that could be something that is easily replaced like packaging or production machines that last for years.

There is no way the average pharmacist could know and would tell you openly. I still don't know about shortage of many products I work with directly. I'm guessing it's a mix of my suppliers not knowing either and them not wanting to tell me until they are sure and have a decent idea of dates (because if they tell me that they might not have what I need, they know I'll go try to find someone else who does).

The reality is that almost everything has at least some components made in China if you go back far enough. But if you go back far enough, there are also more points where safety stock is kept. Production may have stopped on those components but people won't start hearing about it until a few levels of safety stock run out.

Medical products are another level of complexity. Even if supply meets what demand was planned for months ago, that doesn't mean there will be enough. If people usually get a couple of months at a time but try to get 6 months at a time because of fears of the Coronavirus, then there's suddenly a shortage because of an unpredictable spike in demand. That's what's happening with masks now. I don't think there have been any major disruptions in supply yet but they're out of stock everywhere because people want them. Even if there are shortage of medicine, there will be a lot of care taken to avoid panic. Pharmacists will almost certainly not be told and be telling customers unless there is already a plan in place to get people what they need. At the same time, medical products and medicine are more important than most other products so there will be a higher emphasis at reopening factories that produce anything that goes into those.

There are almost certainly going to be shortages of some things that go into medicine at some stages of the supply chain but I think it's unlikely that those will hit consumers in any significant way."

Du vergleichst eine neue Krankheit die vor allem in China durch Maximalmaßnahmen versucht wird im Keim zu ersticken mit einer Krankheit die sich frei bewegen kann. **Natürlich** ist die Influenza derzeit rein mengenmäßig in absoluten Zahlen die Gefährlichere. 

Aber die Faktenlage ist mittlerweile ziemlich klar. Das Coronavirus ist *ein bisschen* bis *wesentlich* ansteckender als die Influenza und wesentlich tödlicher. Der einzige Unterschied ist derzeit die effektive Ausbreitung auf die Bevölkerung.

Wenn du beide frei grassieren lassen würdest, dann wären die Coronafälle wesentlich häufiger und wesentlich schlimmer. Das ist doch nicht so schwer zu kapieren? 

Es gilt jetzt Maßnahmen zu setzen, damit das Coronavirus sich eben nicht auf die generelle Bevölkerung verbreitet, so wie es leider bei anderen Viren in der Vergangenheit passiert ist (Schweinegrippe zum Beispiel. War auch nicht gerade leiwand für die, die daran verreckt sind). Denn wenn das passiert, dann haben wir in der Saison mindestens doppelt so viel Tote in absoluten Zahlen, zumindest anfänglich, bis sich herumspricht, dass man gegen das eine ja impfen kann."
2020-02-23,Kujo17,cvnews,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/cvnews/comments/f8chyu/almost_all_patients_in_south_korean_psychiatric/fike6wc/,"Almost all patients at a psychiatric ward of a South Korean hospital tested positive for the coronavirus, with local reports saying a religious sect with followers who were infected had attended a funeral in the same complex.

South Korea’s two confirmed deaths from the virus were also from the Cheongdo hospital’s mental health division, Korea’s Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said Saturday. Both patients had been moved out of the psychiatric ward for medical treatment before their deaths, Vice Health and Welfare Minister Kim Kang-lip said at a briefing.

South Korea reported 229 new confirmed cases on Saturday, as the number of infections more than doubled in a day to 433. Of the total, 231 were linked to a church called Shincheonji in the city of Daegu, while at least 111 -- including four nurses -- were from the psychiatric ward of the hospital in Cheongdo County. The two clusters account for almost 80% of the confirmed cases.
Cheongdo, famous for its bull-fighting competition, is a rural town near Daegu. The funeral of the brother of the Shincheonji’s leader took place earlier this month in Cheongdo, and health officials are examining ties between the church and the hospital. Local media reports say the funeral was held in the building that houses the psychiatric ward.

Shincheonji, formally known as Church of Jesus, the Temple of the Tabernacle of the Testimony, said on its website that it’s trying to list attendees of the funeral and denied its Chinese followers were part of the crowd at the ceremony.

Earlier this week, the disease-control center said an inpatient who died after suffering for a long time with chronic pneumonia was confirmed only after his death to have been infected with the coronavirus. The 63-year-old man had been at the hospital’s mental health unit since late 2017, the KBS broadcaster reported.
The second fatality was a patient from the same ward, identified only as a woman born in 1965. She died shortly after being transferred to another hospital in Busan because of a lack of beds, the center said."

It is absolute panic, the hospital is closed to the public and relatives some patients continue to call worried about their hospitalized family members, who have been subjected to the swab today "".

The emergency commissioner Angelo Borrelli said it, confirming that there is still no precise indication. ""It is difficult to formulate predictions for what diffusion can be - he added - the only concrete and valid measure to be adopted is therefore to close the territories"". At the moment the only areas subject to isolation as they are considered outbreaks of the virus are the ten municipalities of the Lodi area identified in the ordinance of the minister of health and the governor of Lombardy and the territory of the municipality of Vo 'Euganeo,where the first police patrols arrived to establish the checkpoints provided for by the government decree.

The other problem is that we are trusting government numbers, which even in early stages of infection in the US has shown that governments are lying. Look at the court injunction won by California for 50 Coronavirus patients being sent to a facility there when the official number is still at 35 in the US... The numbers don't add up."

Still, no reason to scare the public with these tweets which is irresponsible. Because like you, the average person will overreact and start screeching about pandemics and so on. 

There's already plenty of coronavirus strains that cause the common cold and pneumonia, we already have to manage the disease burden of these infections. The important part is containing it in China, outside of China it's not going to be umanageable."

Deaths have been in those with other major health complications and it hasnt been showing to kill relatively healthy young people, its staying in the flu range- the really old and really young. 

Also a believe I saw an article recently that the virus has  had its genome deciphered so work can begin on a vaccine. The best people to ease your fears are doctors. Doctor Mike on youtube has made updates about the virus and given medical information to make sure you know what's going on. Alert, not panic. Practice good hygiene techniques such as good handwashing. Basically the same things they tell you for the flu."

No, as you said, “the rich countries have all the resources they need” so they can test for it.

When the 2011 earthquake and tsunami struck the Fukushima Prefecture of Japan, the electronics industry had a huge problem on its hands. Two Mitsubishi Gas Chemical factories in the affected area made almost the entire world’s supply of an epoxy resin called bismaleimide triazine, or BT. Electronics chip manufacturers regularly used BT to seal their components. No BT, no chips, without a major manufacturing overhaul.

“It was buried within a supply chain—a component of a component,” said Josh Nelson, a principal in strategy and business transformation practice of The Hackett Group, a strategic consultancy.
Now, as coronavirus continues to spread, the region of China most heavily affected by the outbreak is a hub of global supply chains. A new Dun & Bradstreet study estimates that 163 of the Fortune 1000 have tier 1 suppliers—those they do direct business with—in the area. And 938 have tier 2 suppliers, which feed the first tier.
“That’s where it becomes troubling,” Nelson said. “It’s going to be that [item] where only one plant is qualified to make that and it’s going to interrupt a whole production line.”

The pinch is already being felt. Amazon has been stockpiling Chinese-made goods, Under Armour warned of a $50-$60 million potential shortfall in Q1, multiple automakers have shut down factories in China, and Nintendo expects “inevitable” production and shipment delays. And a growing number of companies have issued earnings warnings related to coronavirus.

Beyond the already announced effects, many Fortune 1000 companies still don’t know how seriously their operations will be affected. Although likely aware of tier 1 suppliers’ statuses, they (and 5 million other companies globally, by Dun & Bradstreet’s estimation) have little interaction with the tier 2 level they indirectly use, all of which happen to be in the same part of China.

“The waters get murkier,” said Brian Alster, general manager of third-party risk and compliance for Dun & Bradstreet. Plus, China’s impact on the world’s commerce has grown. “When you look at SARS outbreak in 2003, they were 2% of global GDP,” Alster said. “Today they’re 20%.”

I’ve written this for people who are really worried about the corona vírus. If you want to help make this a copy-pasta, this information, as of release, is 100% correct.

*Coronavirus*
As of 23th February most cases happened or are directly linked to Asia, the majority linked with China. The main point of suspicion for someone to have been infected by the virus is contact with someone who was a confirmed case. If your country as of right now doesn’t have a confirmed case, you don’t have to worry as of right now. There has been 11 cases confirmed in the US, 9 of those had been in China during the outbreak and 2 of those had contact with the previous 9. 

We don’t know the full mechanism of transmission as of right now. We are sure it spreads person-to-person via respiratory droplets, same as common cold and influenza. The main way you can protect yourself is to always wash your hands before and after contact with another person, independent of health status of the said person, and don’t touch your eyes and nose directly if you haven’t washed your hands. This might seem silly, but is the most proved way to prevent infection so (NEJM teaching how to wash hands)[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGmMDC-4IMY]

Symptoms: Coronavirus is known to cause viral pneumonia (fever, cough, dyspnea) about 20% of confirmed patients evolved into critical illness (respiratory failure, septic shock, multiple organ failure) with overall fatality being around 2% with higher mortality for people with underlying medical comorbidies (such as Astma) or age higher than 60.

*Comparison with the Flu*
The Flu has a lower mortality rate and a lower rate of critical illness, specially due to vaccination and medication that can decrease the severity of the disease. If you country offers Flu vaccination, and you don’t have immunosuppression, I highly recommend you take those each year.

All of the material I have read shows that the first infected were market workers, market customer's, and those who lived near the market.

Since you are mentioning the eating of bats, I have to assume you aren't very familiar with the facts around this case, as nobody is saying it came from eating bats. Not me, or this article. As it, and myself, and the evidence shows it came from bats, through an animal vector.

An animal vector being an intermediary host.

>The wet market is a good breeding ground not because of the stuff that is sold there.

Again, this is not true. The live holding of wild animals is exactly how these things make the jump to humans. Live animals, in cramped conditions, sick, becoming reservoirs for virus before being slaughtered on site and sold.

MERS came like this from a wetmarket Saudia Arabia from a bat coronavirus through a suspected camel vector. And SARS came like this from a wetmarket in the Guangdong Province, with the animal vector being civets.

To further show how you are incorrect in stating it is due to the foot traffic, and not related to how the live animals are held. Of the 500+ samples collected from the market, 33 samples came back positive for the virus, and 31 of those were found where the live animals were held and traded.

So I do not think you are correct in your thinking, as all the evidence so far points to coming from an animal vector introduced by practice of live wild animal trading."
2020-02-23,rad-aghast,Coronavirus,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/f8ayx2/generic_pharmaceuticals_in_canada_pharmacists/fikmwp9/,"Yeah, I'm divided on the matter in a way I never thought I would be.

The SARS outbreak was handled incredibly unprofessionally and based on their press announcements it doesn't seem like they've improved much over the past decade.  They definitely need to be more proactive, especially when it comes to protecting health workers, [with nurses' unions already raising alarms](https://globalnews.ca/news/6557591/coronavirus-protection-nurses-unions/).  There's also very little public education happening at the moment and much of it is misinformation since they're so behind on the data.

However... this is a really different situation from SARS.  Between the details re. asymptomatic transmission and the long incubation period significantly reducing the potential benefit of quarantines, plus the global impact of manufacturing and shipping slowing down... this seems like we've got big problems on our hands no matter what we do.

If we don't quarantine, the disease runs its course, which is a public health and safety problem.  If we quarantine, people and hospitals will have low or no supplies due to manufacturing shut-downs and cargo transportation barriers, which is a public health and safety problem... and potentially a huge, widespread economic problem.

My fingers are crossed for a vaccine, that's how H1N1 was put to bed."

Epidemija je pojava brzog sirenja bolesti u populaciji u kratkom vremenskom periodu, obicno u roku od 2 nedelje. Za svaku bolest postoji tacno utvrdjeni 'rate' koji se smatra epidemicnom stopom. Primera radi, za meningokokalne infekcije to je svega 15 slucajeva na 100.000 ljudi (razumete kako mala sirina?). Kada se utvrdi da postoji 15 obolelih na 100.000 ljudi u nekoj oblasti (gde su granice te oblasti u okviru kojih se meri 100.000/15 obolelih opet odredjene pravilnikom), proglasava se epidemija. 

Proglasenje epidemije ima za svrhu sprecavanje sirenja dalje infekcije, obrazuju se zarazeni i ugrozeni krug. Zarazeni krug je veoma striktan, dok je ugrozeni malo labilniji. Ovo je isto za svaku bolest, bilo ljudsku ili zivotinjsku.

Kada bolest predje na vise od jednog kontinenta, sa vise od 10 potvedjenih slucajeva zove se pandemijom, i za svaki virusni soj se moze statisticki preracunati svih 6 faza pandemicnog rasta (ne moze se siriti zauvek). 

Sto se same epidemije tice, i karantina, pa lol, i za vreme H5N1 je to postojalo, potvrdjeno zarazeni su lezali na infektivnim bolestima Klinickog centra, a ozbiljno bolesni (oni koji su razvili SARS - primeticete da je H5N1 virus, a ""bolest"" koja nastaje od njega se zove SARS, kao HIV i SIDA) su uvodjeni u vestacku komu. 

Ja licno sam 2012. (?Recimo da je ta godina) prelezala tadasnji Swine flu, i poprilicno je bio ozbiljan, ali su me vratili kuci jer nisam imala nista na plucima, samo sam imala tezak oblik gripa, ne i prateci akutni respiratorni sindrom (od kojeg se zapravo umire kao od komplikacije primarne bolesti). 

Svi nabrojani virusi su Coronavirus (jedna vrsta, razliciti podtipovi). To znaci da statisticki, cak i sa nesigurnim brojevima koje Kinezi laziraju (al ne lazira Italija) vi mozete da uporedite ove tri pandemije (Avian flu, Swine flu and Corona novel virus). Koliko mi se cini Swine je bio najsmrtonosniji, ali se sporije sirio, pa je manje bitan. 

Izmedju H5N1 i corone, H5N1 je imao 9.6% mortality rate, dok Corona ima 2.1% trenutno (Wuhan 4.1%). Takodje morate da razumete i statistiku. 9.6% je verujem bilo oko 1000 ljudi ukupno znaci manji broj ukupno obolelih, dok je 2.1% Corona virusa 2200+ umrlih na 30.000 obolelih. Znaci Corona se siri brze, ali je stepen mortaliteta  isti, sto znaci da nije smrtonosniji per se, samo mu je olaksano sirenje (iz geo-politickih razloga, same strukture virusa, strukture populacije, modernizacije, etc). Znaci, zastite gledano, nije nista opasniji, a pazite sada, 70% obolelih su muskarci, a 80% umrlih su stariji od 60 godina. Kao i kod SARSa, i kod ovog oboljenja stradaju vec oslabljeni organizmi (trudnice, vec oboleli, stariji, hronicno bolesni i deca (mada ne toliko potvrdjenih slucajeva)). 

Da li treba paniciti? 

BRATE SRBI NE PERU RUKE POSLE WCa A NE OVAKO. REALNO CEMO DA POMREMO."

Refugees are next to the border. 

Assad is shelling civilians to take the land easily. 

Heavy Turkish Armed Forces deployment on the region.

Soldiers died.

Russia is backing Assad. That is why turkey cannot attack directly.

Like I said, some will believe coronavirus threat ends today, some will believe it will wipe out mankind. And others somewhere inbetween. No one knows. But we can all agree that coronavirus is known for most of market participants by this point. So while any single individual might not fully know the extend in which it will affect the market, the market result is determined by the collective action of participants given known information. Coronavirus is known information. So while you can argue that the collective have mispriced or underestimate (or overestimate) the threat (and thus have underpriced or overpriced the threat), the threat itself is priced in."

It's fine to try and calm people down, but saying it is similar to a flu is not correct. There are currently 78,966 confirmed cases and 2,469 confirmed deaths due to COVID-19. There is a relatively high chance that  the amount of infected people is not  correct due to it's properties as a virus but it is still several magnitudes worse than the common flu.

The common flu has a mortality rate of around 0.1%. It infects a large chunk of the population each year, this is why the flat sum of deaths appears to be so high, depsite it being relatively harmless.

COVID-19 has an official mortality rate of 2.3%-3.1%, factoring in the unknown amount of infected that were not counted in.

2-3% mortality rate is not that high, but given the ability of spreading without symptoms it can still become way, way worse than the common flu.

,,We zijn vandaag opnieuw naar haar toegegaan, omdat ze gisteren te overstuur was en wij geen aangifte konden opnemen”, laat de politiewoordvoerder Willem-Jan Uijtdehage weten. ,,Ze was nauwelijks aanspreekbaar.”

Maar ook vandaag heeft Cindy geen aangifte gedaan, dus kan de politie op dit moment niet verder met het onderzoek. Waarom zij niet zeker is om aangifte te doen, kan de politie niet zeggen. Mocht ze het alsnog willen doen, dan moet ze zelf naar het politiebureau gaan.

We stayed in AirBnBs all the time except when we were in Hiroshima and Hakone. They were cheaper than most hotels and you get an entire apartment to yourself.

I would bundle all your Tokyo stays in one sitting. You mentioned you didn't mind splurging, so move your Hakone stay at the very end and stay at a ryokan. It's expensive (ours were $150 per night per person), but it was great to just relax and unwind the last few days. We stayed at Kijitei Hoseo, they have an open air hot spring that you can reserve for you and your spouse.

Regarding viewing Mt. Fuji: keep your dates and plans flexible and don't rely on hoping that your planned Mt. Fuji visit will have clear skies. Keep an eye out for cloud forecast and when you see a clear day, drop everything for that day and go see Mt. Fuji. This is another reason why I suggested bundling all your Tokyo days so you have more chances.

There's a lot of day trips from Tokyo if you run out of things to do there. Go check out the snow monkeys, or the Tokugawa shrines, etc.

Check out Kanazawa, it's about 2 hours from Takayama. It's a nice city similar to Kyoto.

Osaka/Kyoto/Nara is like less than an hour from each other, so you can make one city as your ""homebase"" and just take the trains. We chose Kyoto and found an AirBnB 5 mins away from the trains and a big shopping mall.

The Osaka aquarium is super worth a visit.

Rent an electric bike for the day to explore Nara.

If you like matcha, check out Uji. 

If you don't like to lug your luggages around when switching cities, use the services of Takkyubin. You can specify the date and time you want your luggage to arrive by. For instance during our visit, we dropped off our luggage in the morning at Tokyo to be sent to Kyoto, went to Kanazawa and Shirakawa-go for one night (we packed a small backpack for a change of clothes), and by the time we got to our AirBnB in Kyoto our luggages were there already.

Absolutely stop by Himeji. You can enter and climb the castle but if you are a very tall person it might be a challenge.

That's it! Hope you enjoy your vacation! We have our 3rd visit this coming March-April but with the Coronavirus it's looking like it'll have to be rescheduled."

The Wait for China to Shake Off Virus Nears Key Moment: Eco Week

Saturday, February 22, 2020 10:00 PM 
By David Goodman

-	Central bank speakers may give clues on their outlook
-	Weekly take on events in the world economy and their fallout

(Bloomberg) -- Global economists are continuing to grapple with a new and unexpected threat to economic growth, leaving them scrambling to assess how quickly commerce can recover from the impact of the coronavirus.

Research by Bloomberg Economics shows China is slowly getting back to work, with the economy running at 50%-60% capacity in the week to Feb. 21 and forecast to jump from Feb. 24. Still, the spread of the virus is starting to ripple into supply chains across the world, and showing up in data across Asia and Europe.

In more conventional economic matters, policy makers from the U.K., Canada, Europe and the U.S. give speeches that may give clues into their view of the global outlook, while the world’s biggest economy publishes personal spending data.

Here’s what happened last week and below is our weekly wrap of what else is going on in the world economy this week.

Asia

As the coronavirus’s spread continues to overshadow the region, China will release PMI data on Saturday that will give the first official read on how badly the world’s second-largest has been hit. South Korea’s central bank will meet to set policy on Thursday. Governor Lee Ju-yeol has warned the coronavirus outbreak could have a negative impact on the economy, but downplayed growing speculation the bank was preparing to cut interest rates.

President Donald Trump is scheduled to travel to India from Monday to meet Prime Minister Narendra Modi. The White House has downplayed speculation that the leaders will make progress on a planned trade deal. India also publishes fourth-quarter GDP data on Friday.

With the fallout from the coronavirus very much on policy makers’ minds, European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde and more than half a dozen Governing Council members are scheduled to speak. ECB Chief Economist Philip Lane told Bloomberg Television on last week that he expects the euro-area economy to bounce back from the outbreak and economic sentiment data for Germany on Monday and for the region on Thursday will show if it has left its mark on confidence. German inflation and unemployment data round off the week and Jens Weidmann presents the Bundesbank’s annual report.

In the U.K., its a quiet week for data, with confidence and housing reports the most prominent. Meanwhile BOE officials Andy Haldane and Jon Cunliffe are due to speak. Hungary’s central bank holds rate-setting meeting on Tuesday. It’s a meeting to watch as policy makers hinted they may use all tools: while a change in rates is unlikely, the post-decision statement may hint at the end of the ultra-dovish era.

Slowing inflation and a strengthening currency are putting pressure on the Bank of Israel to take a move dovish stance, but solid economic growth in the fourth quarter means the central bank is likely to hold interest rates again on Monday. South African Finance Minister Tito Mboweni budget’s on Wednesday could be key in determining whether Moody’s Investors Service downgrades the nation’s debt to junk status next month.

Also on Wednesday, Botswana’s central bank could cut interest rates again to boost slowing economic growth. While inflation in Mozambique is still low and the IMF has said there is room to cut, the metical has weakened to the lowest level against the dollar since 2017, which means the central bank may continue to hold rates on Thursday.

On Tuesday, Federal Reserve Vice Chairman Richard Clarida discusses the outlook for interest rates and the economy at a conference in Washington, where speakers will also include IMF chief economist Gita Gopinath and Cleveland Fed President Loretta Mester. Later in the week, reports on consumer spending and durable-goods orders are expected to show the U.S. economy off to a modest start to 2020, while the Fed’s preferred inflation gauge may have accelerated to the fastest pace in a year.

Canadian fourth-quarter GDP data out on Friday will show the extent of the Canadian economy’s slowdown at the end of last year, and whether the nation’s expansion has any momentum at all going into 2020. Earlier in the week, Bank of Canada Deputy Governor Tim Lane gives a speech on digital currencies.

Mexico takes center stage in Latin America this coming week with Brazil and Argentina celebrating the Carnival holiday through midweek. Monday’s bi-weekly consumer price report is followed a day later by the final reading on fourth-quarter gross domestic product, which should affirm that the economy in 2019 posted its worst performance in a decade.

On Wednesday, the central bank’s quarterly inflation report updates official forecasts for all manner of economic indicators. Capping the week, the minutes of Banxico’s last meeting published Friday will likely cement bets that a sixth straight interest-rate cut is in the offing when policy makers meet next month."

I arrived on February 9th to get a jump on the spring semester, and I’m generally not an alarmist, but I’m becoming concerned. I’m not sure I want to be here, alone and unable to speak the language, while the country is in the middle of a health crisis. I don’t want to have to navigate the system on my own. I’m not encouraged by the South Korean government’s plan to admit 17,000 students from China and quarantine them in campus dormitories for two weeks so that they can begin their semesters with everybody else. And I’m uncomfortable with the fact that the free health insurance we automatically receive as students is only active during the semester. (So what happens if a student is sick in between the spring and summer semesters? Does that person get stuck with a medical bill for the treatment that occurred during the break?)

I’m thinking of packing up, getting a refund on my tuition, and coming back when things are under control."

2020-02-23,sibalajossi,korea,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/korea/comments/f7ptyf/the_total_is_433_now_jesus/fijw5wm/,"> So you're literally saying ""If you don't lecture me on the whole THAAD  economic fiasco, which took place over months and months and involves  complicated international relations over politics and economics, I'm  going to assume I'm right"". 

No. I'm saying that you should use your wisdom to lecture me about something I clearly don't understand. Why are not able to do that? Look, I'm a dumbass who doesn't know anything. Lecture me about what happened.

The thing is, I know you can't. Why? Because after a couple of exchanges, I realized that I'm talking to a wannabe-intellectual who has no idea in economics or international relations.

If you were that well versed in economics, you would've already refuted my claim that ""exports to China are mainly materials"" with your absolute knowledge. You were the one who gave the number 25% with no context and I corrected you on your number game with the above mentioned fact.

>  I'm not even going to point out that the current ""tanking economy"" was  the result of the government trying to cut some ties with China and make  more connections with SEA,  

The tanking economy has nothing to do with factories moving out of China LOL...... Its because Moon and his clowns were pushing their ""income-led growth"" pipe dream while restricting new businesses to bloom and spending tax-payer money on temporary jobs.

> because you obviously won't believe that the government is already doing something that you're so cleverly suggesting. 

And you think the government is ""moving factories to SEA""? LOL. No. Corporations are moving their factories. Not the government. Moon had visited some SEA countries due to his 신남방정책, but did the government pay for the relocation? How did they contribute in this factor? Corporations like Samsung were way ahead of the government before they even made a move.

> After all, everything Moon does is bad, amirite? 

Yeah how did you know that?

> Last bit of advice: the Korean situation is different because the  majority of cases are coming from a single cult, not people who came in  contact with Chinese nationals as you so desperately seem to want to  believe. 

So who infected the cult member? And how many unknown cases existed before? And how are you going to quantify the impact of the ""single cult""? And why are you assuming Chinese nationals have no effect on the current situation?

You know what is funny tho? You won't be able to answer any of these questions because your belief system doesn't allow you to see things without a filter.

> And yes, in any given situation, I believe the experts who are the most  well-versed in that specific situation. That's what you do in muder  investigations too: you don't go to any cop, you go to homicide  detectives. You don't go to any doctors, you go to the doctors who  specialize in mass outbreaks. 

Well... what if I tell you that [""doctors who specialize in mass outbreaks""](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/travelers/from-china.html) have been banning travel from the whole Chinese region for almost 2 weeks? You think Korean doctors are sooooo good and the US are just dumbasses who ""close their borders and risk for the economy to tank""?

> But you know what? Choose to believe you're right. Why wouldn't you,  it's what you've done so far, and you're clearly happy in your echo  chamber. Good day. 

You're the one saying ""No! I'm not going to look at what the rest of the world is doing and only listen to Korean experts!!"". Talking about an echo chamber, don't you here your own voice? HAHAHAHA. Ridiculous aren't you?"

We used to be extremely close a year ago, but she moved schools and I changed while she remained the same. I just dont really enjoy spending time with her anymore and rarely do, because we just simply have different interests and senses of humor now. The problem is I dont know how to say no when she asks to go somewhere with me.
I just don’t feel myself around her and when we spend time together time seems to drag on. 
Today when we were shopping together, she nearly bought two things while I didn’t buy anything. She was disrespectful to the employees and it was kind of irritating. Her humor consists of a cycle of jokes centering around being racist, blaming Asians for the coronavirus, and fat shaming herself and others. 
The major nail on the head was the fact that after wasting about 50 dollars, she didn’t have enough money to buy food. We had previously eaten and split the money, yet she still relied on me to pay the remaining change. For example, she ordered the food knowing she was multiple dollars short and when the cashier rang up her total, she looked at me and expected me to hand over the money. I would’ve covered it for her, but we had already eaten, and she had spent upwards of 50 dollars while I spent nothing towards myself. 
I dont know if I should pretend to be busy every time she wants to meet up or straight up tell her.

More testing = more cases. More cases = severe economic impact. Severe economic impact = corporate debt bubble bursts. Corporate debt bubble bursting = lower re-election chances.

And, yes, I know that makes no sense.

>Bloomberg - another automotive runs into problems; Nissan is warning of disruptions in plants as far as the US due to the virus epidemic leading to parts shortages. They procure more than 800 parts from factories in Hubei and are concerned that many of these parts will run out (including such things as brake hoses and air conditioning controllers) if the plants do not come back online by today (the date the government indicated most production could resume). This could lead some Nissan output in Japan to be suspended as early as Jan 23rd with Malaysia following not longer after. Plants in the US, UK, India, Mexico, Russia and Spain may also have to stop production. A survey of their suppliers found only 58% said they'd be able to resume by Feb 10th with many others saying they couldn't because they couldn't get necessary government approval. Of those that have gone back online, only half of them could get the majority of their workforce working. (Link)

​>Reuters - major automotive parts manufacturer Valeo (19.48bn EUR revenue in 2019) says that most of its Chinese factories are now back online but not at full operational capacity. It expects production to fall by 2% this year and adds that that it is too early to evaluate the impact of the virus on the company's 2020 results and the wider auto industry. (Link)

​>The International Air Transport Association (IATA) says that Asia-Pacific airlines could lose $27.8 bn to coronavirus according to Philstar (Link). The estimate is based on projections of a 13-percent full-year decline in passenger demand, mostly in China. IATA's CEO says that this will be the first time since the 2008-2009 financial crisis that demand for air travel has declined and that stopping the virus is a top priority. Airlines in China's domestic market alone are estimated to lose around $12.8 billion in revenues, reversing an expected 4.8% growth into a 8.2% contraction.

​>Food prices - China produces 80-90% of the worlds garlic supply (depending on which article you read) and the price of it is rising sharply. Prices in the US are up 29% from last year whilst wholesale prices are up even more to 60% higher than this time last year. The reason is difficulties in transportation and a shortage of labour as most people are yet to return to work (either because they're unwilling or they're physically unable). (Link).

​>Amazon is beginning to worry about Prime day in July - the Seattle Times reports (link). Third party merchants account for about 60% of its sales and it has reached out to these merchants to understand how they might be impacted. Over the past few weeks, Amazon has responded to the crisis by making larger and more frequent orders of Chinese-made products that had already been shipped to the United States, according to company emails and consultants who work with major brands. Some of its suppliers have cut back on advertising and promotions on the site so they don’t run out of products too quickly. “Out of an abundance of caution, we are working with suppliers to secure additional inventory to ensure we maintain our selection for customers,” an Amazon spokeswoman said. The company later added, “We are monitoring developments related to the coronavirus and taking appropriate steps as needed.” Amazon’s algorithms have now asked for six to eight weeks of supply on products made in China instead of just two or three weeks.

​>The Taiwanese commonwealth magazine has a thoroughly interesting read on whether Taiwanese companies can cope with the Coronavirus (link). It focuses on The Formosa Plastics Group (revenue: 67.2bn USD) first which has forecast that the coronavirus scare will hit it far harder than did the SARS crisis in 2003, with first quarter revenues, which were originally expected to take a turn for the better, likely to slump from the previous quarter. If China shuts down for an extended period of time and inventories build up, “under the worst case scenario, the crack spread [the difference in price between a refined product and crude oil] would fall below US$2, and we would cut production, which would mean we were producing below cost,” Formosa Petrochemical Corp. President Tsao Minh explained. Other industries are examined; automotive has significant issues which we all now know, but steel should be OK from a supply perspective because raw material comes from Australia, Brazil or Canada. The article finishes by explaining that the worst may yet be to come for the entertainment and tourism industries.

​>Getting workers physically back to work - the SCMP (South China Morning Post) reports (link) that provincial governments in China’s east coast manufacturing hubs are chartering buses, planes and trains to get workers back into their factories to get things moving again; passenger traffic on public transport is only 1/5th of what it was this time last year. Couples returning to work at open factories are eligible for a one-off subsidy of 500 yuan (US$71), while a company that hires more staff than in the same period a year earlier can also receive subsidies up to 300,000 yuan (US$42,800) whilst the city of Yiwu is refunding bus and train tickets for workers who return if they arrive before tomorrow.

​>Economic woes spread to companies who don't have supply chains: the Epoch Times has an article (link) warning that many small to medium sized enterprises don't have large cash reserves and may struggle if the situation continues for a sustained period. Just 34 percent of nearly 1,000 small and medium-sized firms said they could survive for a month on current cashflow, a recent survey by Tsinghua University and Peking University showed. A third said they could last for two months, while 18 percent said they could stick it out for three months. One analyst estimates that total job losses in China could be as high as 4.5 million.

​>Apple's Foxconn and Pegatron factories might be open, but don't assume they're fully staffed says MPR News (link). ""One production line used to have 4,000 people. Now there are about a dozen remaining. My own production line usually has 1,000 workers, with about 60 now remaining,"" says a female hanjia worker at Foxconn. (Hanjia means winter break, i.e. people who continue working through the spring holiday that most Chinese take off). Smaller manufacturers are having a harder time. A rare earths magnet maker that normally employs about 300 people in the city of Hangzhou, south of Kunshan, received permission to reopen from local authorities last week. The factory was able to begin manufacturing again with a skeleton crew after buying a large disinfectant machine. Rare earth magnets are used in everything from electronics to motors. For any factory to reopen now, ""There's paperwork that has to be submitted to the local government, and that includes guaranteeing masks, some other protective gear that employees can wear, a disinfecting schedule,"" says manager Jen Ambrose, one of the few Americans who works at the magnet company.

​>A white paper has arrived! Dun and Bradstreet have done a great report on the economic impact of the coronavirus. If you're into economics, this is definitely worth a 15 minute read. Some takeaways: 90% of all active business in China are affected. At least 51,000 companies around the world have one or more direct tier 1 suppliers and at least 5 million have at least one or more tier 2 suppliers. Alternative countries for suppliers: Electrical machinery and parts could come from Brazil, the nuclear industry could tap Chile or Singapore, Furniture, plastics, toys and games could be covered by Mexico and Brazil, Motor vehicle parts as well as optical and surgical products could be covered by Chile, Colombia or India. Growth is certainly going to drop below previous forecasts but how much by depends on how fast the virus is contained."

Come race day, rain is pouring down with great intensity in Melbourne, but after 69 safety car laps the race finally starts. Bottas crashes into Hamilton T1, taking both Mercs out of the race and making Toto smash his new table. Leclerc and Verstappen engage in an intense battle for the lead, but Vettel, who is following closely, suddenly s🅱️ins and collides with both, taking the trio out of the race. Albon's gp2 engine™ then blows up on the restart after the safety car, prompting another one. Grosjean crashes in the pits, blocking Raikkonen for 4 laps' time until the Fin calls it and leaves the car, making a b-line to the first bar to have the drincc. Perez and Stroll are told to collide on T1 by rich daddy, and the drivers quickly do so in an effort to keep copying Mercedes. Kvyat torpedoes Ricciardo to even things out after the incident at Baku, and then Gasly does the same to KMAG, after being caught out by his usual defensive moves. Magnussen is and will always be stupid. After the twentieth safety car restart and with 7 laps to go, Russel and Ocon collide, wiping the unlucky Norris out in the process, while Latifi spins out by himself. 
This memorable race finally comes to an end, and someone will excitedly remark how good it was and how hyped they are for the rest of the season. Unfortunately though, the coronavirus pandemic is so widesppread that all races after Melbourne are cancelled. The championship goes to Robert Kubica, who was filling in for the unlucky paddock patient 0 Giovinazzi, after Sainz is disqualified due to no video evidence of him cutting the line being found.*"

Neither the NSC nor DHS epidemic teams have been replaced.

There’s probably a lot of potential zoonotic diseases which *could* cross over, so there’s a selection process going on: of course diseases that are most able to infect the local humans are will be the ones which make it to the big time.

My take is that Chinese scientists aren’t stupid so they aren’t going to conclude this is a bio weapon aimed at killing old people and crippling US manufacturing."

If you have traveled to China and returned on Friday, Jan. 24, or later, you are expected to self-quarantine in your home for 14 days beginning the day of your arrival, and should not report to work or class.
If this applies to you, here are the steps you should take:
Register with your local county health department and follow instructions for symptom monitoring:
Nebraska: Contact information for all county health departments in Nebraska
Iowa: Contact information for all county health departments in Iowa
Notify us:
Employees: Contact your manager
Faculty members and providers: Contact your department administrator or chair 
Students: Contact your campus student health center:
UNL: 402.472.5000
UNO: 402.554.2374
UNMC: 402.559.5158
During self-quarantine, if you experience a fever or respiratory symptoms, contact your county health department for further instruction
Receive authorization to return to work or class if you do not develop symptoms during your 14-day quarantine:
Employees, faculty members or providers: Contact Nebraska Medicine Employee Health at 402.552.3563
Students: Contact your campus student health center
UNL: 402.472.5000
UNO: 402.554.2374
UNMC: 402.559.5158
At the conclusion of the 14 day self-quarantine period, if you are symptom free and have checked in with Employee Health or Student Health, you will be welcomed back to your usual position and accustomed duties.  
If there is an outbreak in Nebraska, what would the health system do? Do they have enough masks and hospital beds for patients?  
We plan and prepare for these types of events. We have been reviewing our organizational pandemic plan and meeting to address preparedness issues. Supplies and additional space for patients are at the top of our list of things we prepare for. 
Could you evaluate the risk in Nebraska compared with other states in the United States?   
At the present time, there are very few cases of the novel coronavirus in the U.S. The risk in the U.S. is low and the risk in Nebraska is even lower, as there are fewer travelers from China. Although the risk is low at this time, the situation is being monitored closely, and contingency plans have been formulated. The Nebraska Biocontainment Unit could serve as a referral site to care for patients who contract this virus. We expect that more cases will arise in the U.S., however, we do not yet know enough about the virus to predict how widely it will spread outside of China.  
Compared with SARS, is this a bigger threat to the U.S.? And compared with flu, is COVID-19 more serious? 
Based on current information, we think that this virus causes milder disease on average compared with SARS. However, the new coronavirus seems to be more readily spread from person-to-person than SARS. We anticipate more information from scientists and public health officials over the next few weeks that will help us understand the level of risk to the U.S. and other countries. However, we know that influenza is a danger every year, causing 35,000 deaths in an average season in the U.S. We’re currently experiencing a very active flu season, so it’s important to get your flu shot, stay home from work or school if you’re sick, avoid close contact with those who are sick, cover your cough or sneeze with a tissue and wash your hands frequently. 
Are there additional resources for international students who may have a language or cultural barrier? 
All health care facilities have interpreter services available if needed. The WHO website has information on the 2019 novel coronavirus available in Chinese."

But as it's spreading now, it's only a matter of time when it's everywhere.

Let say it hits Tx and it looks like your city is getting quaratined: Will you escape somewhere remote or wait it out in your house for like a month?

2020-02-23,Enilodnewg,worldnews,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/f88aso/coronavirus_wuhan_to_quarantine_all_cured/filtdzq/,"General hygiene is an issue. There was just a video on r/documentaries yesterday I think. It showed truck stop toilets that were *horrifically disgusting* with nowhere to wash your hands, and a culture of spitting and snot rockets. The guy in the documentary said that spitting was part of an old health thing, clearing your lungs in the morning. But that widespread general habit creates droplets virtually *everywhere*. 

But I also read something from national geographic that said there's some evidence that suggests this virus came from illegal pangolin scales. The virus that some pangolins carry are closely related to 2019-nCov, the current coronavirus. 2 researchers from South China Agricultural University in Guangzhou suggest the pagonlin is a potential source based on genetic comparisons of the 2 viruses.

As of January, China's national insurance program no longer covers pangolin products. ""Now with pangolin products could be a vector for the current outbreak, China is seriously reconsidering its wildlife consumption."" Which is likely in those wet markets.

But I hope that means they stop using pangolin products, and not destroying actual pangolins because that's where the outbreak may have come from. Unfortunately in rural areas, these rules are much harder to enforce. I'll try to find and link the video about hygiene in China. I couldn't watch most of it, I couldn't stomach watching animals being abused."
