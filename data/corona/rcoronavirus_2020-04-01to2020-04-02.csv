Hide it from  the Chinese people?  Sure.

Hide it from the Western intelligence agencies?  Not a chance.

It's one thing to hide a new weapon system, it's quite another to hide tens, or hundreds of thousands of deaths. The China of 2020 is no longer as closed as North Korea.  The China of 2020 is far more open, making it far more difficult to hide wide spread calamities. 

The US and Western intelligence services via satellite could measure the activity at cremation sites, the truck traffic in and out of those locations, and the traffic in and out of hospital morgues.   Then there's the human intelligence, and signals (wiretaps) intelligence.

And if the US intelligence services knew how bad it was (and they *had* to know), that means the White House was told.  And even though the White House knew the true extent of the contagion, they did next to nothing, for months. 

TLDR - Yes, China lied.  But that doesn't begin to excuse the months of delays and refusals to act by the White House and other governments.  They refused to act likely because they valued the economy over the lives of their citizens."

Anyone who believes anything US ""intelligence"" says is a fool. US has been engaged in a ""blame China"" campaign all week to distract from the US government's shoddy performance. The goal is just to keep people focused on China. 

As a European, what I know is that virtually every European country has received supplies from China, including my home nation of Ireland. Hotspots like Italy and Spain have received teams of doctors and medics. 

What has the US done? Well they spent [the G-7](https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/25/mike-pompeo-g7-coronavirus-149425) trying to get the word Coronavirus replaced with Wuhan virus. Tried to [steal](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/16/not-for-sale-anger-in-germany-at-report-trump-seeking-exclusive-coronavirus-vaccine-deal) a potential vaccine from Germany. Used the [US military](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8127511/PICTURED-Air-Force-flies-500-000-coronavirus-testing-kits-Italy-quiet-Reach-911-mission.html) to fly out half a million testing kits 
from Italy because their own CDC kits didn't work. 

Generally US hasn't helped any nation because they cannot even help themselves. 

But one thing the US has been busy doing is shit-talking China, and this while there own nurses in New York wear bin bags because they don't have any PPE.

China or Chinese companies have now donated supplies to all 54 Africans nations. Sent teams and supplies to both Iran and Iraq. Sold or supplied a majority of Europe with supplies and doctors. Working with Cuba on an Anti-viral treatment and sent millions of masks to South Korea, Japan, and just today Laos.

Two days ago I developed pneumonia - couldn't speak without gasping, high heart rate and sweaty even when just sitting. I became scared enough to try to get help. This is what that process looked like:

I call a nearby health clinic and their automatic answering service says they have no available times today.

I check the website of a different nearby health clinic. They have a big red letter warning stating that you are not to come to the healthcare clinic if you have corona symptoms and instead should call 1177 (the national healthcare hotline).I logon to to the [1177.se](https://1177.se) (the national health support website)I see a red banner advertising a digital corona clinic. I click on it and fill out a very long form asking me lots of questions. The result is a digital appointment with a nurse. The first question she asks me is if I live in Gävleborg. I don't. She says this service is only for those who live in Gävleborg and signs off.

I go back to the main [1177.se](https://1177.se) website and see there is a digital corona self-test tool one can do. I take the test. It is very long and asks lots of questions about my symptoms and health background. The result leads to another digital appointment with a different nurse. This one doesn't seem to care where I live. But she asks questions that don't make any sense and chatting with her is like being in a comedy sketch. She also starts yelling at me in text which freaks me out because Swedish is my second language and I'm already very sick and scared. I took screen shots of that conversation if anyone who reads Swedish wants to see the insanity of it. But the biggest issue is she keeps telling me to contact my healthclinic. (Excerpt: Me: How do I get past the health clinic's automatic answering service? Nurse: Follow the instructions! Me: I did and they say they have no times and it hangs up. Nurse: Call them tomorrow morning!)

I call the other health clinic. I'm able to book a telephone appointment with a nurse for in 2 hours time. The nurse calls and I do my best to explain my situation, it isn't easy, I'm gasping for air. She tells me they don't handle corona patients at all and to call the 1177 hotline.

I hang up and call the 1177 hotline. I'm number 5 in the queue for 45 minutes. It takes over an hour for anyone to answer. The nurse who answers seems calm and competent and communicating with her is much easier than the website chat nurse. I explain my situation.

She gives me the hard truth: you should consider yourself infected with corona and you must isolate at home. I told her that I was afraid I have pneumonia. She said I do have pneumonia but there's nothing to be done about it. She says very clearly and sternly: there is no treatment for the pneumonia you have. You must get better on your own, by yourself at home. I ask how I will know if I need to go to the hospital. She said, if you can't breathe at all. I said, I'm already struggling to breathe. She asked me if I can stand up. I said yes. She said call an ambulance if you can't stand up. The only treatment is to be put on a ventilator and that is only for the very worst patients. The only tests available are for those patients who need to be on ventilators. Everyone else with corona is to stay home."

Arnold Schwarzenegger told POLITICO on Tuesday it was ""shortsighted"" for California leaders to abandon a $200 million emergency preparedness effort he initiated in 2006 to deal with a future pandemic, as the state now scrambles to prepare for a surge in coronavirus cases.
When the state budget swelled 14 years ago, Schwarzenegger launched a surge capacity stockpile that included mobile hospitals and medical gear intended to prepare California for a situation like it is facing today. With the state facing a $26 billion deficit in 2011, Gov. Jerry Brown and state lawmakers withdrew funding to maintain the supplies, according to an investigative report last week by Reveal and the Los Angeles Times."

Neonates have an immature blood brain barrier and a weaker immune system, since they are used to having their mothers antibodies and the placenta to fight infections. The risk of serious bacterial infection is dramatically higher in the first 1 month of life, and fairly high in the first 3 months. By that time the blood brain barrier matures and the baby is starting to produce their own immune cells. 

The most common sources of neonatal meningitis would be from vertical transmission from the mother, from an vaccinated parent/sibling or a family who eats unpasteurized milk/cheese and gives their family Listeria. Sure, there are very specific circumstances that would need to line up incredibly well to have a stranger pass an infection on (Strep pneumo, Neisseria etc), but this whole story of a nurse giving 12 babies meningitis seems very unlikely/probably very exaggerated. 

Your little one was very sick, and for that I sympathize, but I would be hesitant to blame the health care worker considering that roughly >90% of causes of meningitis in children < 3 months are related to the mother (Group B Strep) or stupid life decisions (Listeria/haemophilus/not vaccinating) and much rarer transmission from an **obviously** sick contact (Strep pnemo)

If masks are in short supply, send the police and the military, cordon off every hardware store one by one, take all the necessary PPE, and do the same in the supply warehouses. Or at a minimum, just ban the sale of necessary PPE nationwide. Masks have been sold out worldwide since January, since before the Chinese new year.

They're saying, just leave the masks on the store shelves, for anyone to buy, but no one should buy them? This is the same bullshit story for months now.

It's like saying, fire extinguishers are available in the stores, but we ask people to walk right past, look at them, but not actually purchase them, since we need them for the firefighters.

In normal times, the supply chain for the healthcare sector is totally separate from what lands on the shelves in the hardware stores. 

The problem is that they failed to prepare, not that consumers went out and bought all the medical masks *because that supply line is totally different and consumers don't have access to it*. Further, in light of the total failure to prepare, yes, all available masks from the consumer supply line should go to HCWs. And who should be responsible for that? Jim bob the consumer? NO! Obviously the government and/or hospital agencies should take charge of intercepting the consumer supply. Fucking duh. ""panic buying"" of masks is a pure scapegoating / blame shifting technique imo. 

Taiwan did this: the government swooped in and started controlling the supply chain of masks very early on. They even have enough to give to civilians, but they ofc take care of HCWs first.  It's not rocket science. 

That said, if you did buy a bunch of the non-medical supply that was not properly controlled at this point it is good to consider donating it and replacing it with cloth masks instead (unless you have health issues)."

The only thing Germany did was early preparation. Germany strongly decentralized testing to include university hospitals and private labs and started massively buying the reagents and chemicals needed as early as January/Febuary when only a couple of countries were competing to get the chemicals.

Now everyone is competing for reagents and nobody can supply as fast to plug the shortage. Everyone knows how to test, it's not like most countries are stupid, but if you can't get your hands on hardware and supply, knowledge alone won't help you test more.

The decentralization had its downsides tho, there is a little bit of a organizational chaos and everyone does stuff a little differently and the RKI (which is basically Germanys CDC) has a hard time getting an overview of who has what, done what thing and how much.

Another thing probably is the fact that Germany is one of the few countries in Europe, if not the only country, that has a massive oversupply of ICU beds, estimates range up to 28,000. They did austerity in other places, but left the ICU bed numbers relatively stable."

It simply doesn't work that way.  Ive had UC for 20 years.  In 1 year I had a medication that was (without insurance) 19,700$ per dose (a dose every 6 weeks).  I had another medication that was 1000$ per month before insurance and probably another 1000$ a month in the 8-9 other meds I took/take.  And then at the end of the year I had surgery that (without insurance) was 90,000$ (done by an excellent team of amazing surgeons, doctors and nurses I might add).

So what is that?  200,000$ in meds and another 100,000$ in care?  At my very best me and the wife brought in 100k, maybe a little more or a little less.  But when your sick you also don't work, so how is it you, on your own merit, pull yourself up by your bootstraps when you not only lose your income but also have your medical expenses increase 100 fold? How does that work?

Ive long argued against single payer government healthcare.  Primarily because the government tends to abjectly fail at most things they do it seems.  But the harsh reality is the way things are now are just as broken, their just easier to ignore when you and yours are healthy.  I mean I'm the first to admit I ignored it, until I didn't/couldn't.

Even with medicare it destroyed us financially.  I only have a home thanks to generosity of my wifes family.  The previous generations hard work saved me (for now), but how many of us have that lifeline?  How much longer will I?

This is complety different.  The care is not available.  Its not being withheld, it doesnt exist.  

I get a sense of what they are saying though.  I could go to Lowes, pick up some PVC, and hook 10 people up to a ventilator.

&#x200B;

I am really tired of many half truths/lies being posted in this sub so i wanted to write a good explanation but it takes hell time.

still will try to write some but before writing, everyone should know why the biggest jump today (and mostly in next 2 days) is, without informing police, a mosque conducted some meetings for 3 days with thousands of people with foreign nationals and those foreign nationals had corona so these people got it and govt found about it yesterday and sadly these people spread over whole india now so police searching for these people and sending them for testing.

now, positive things

&#x200B;

1. People in india don't visit other countries often
2. india banned flights to china early
3. banned other countries too early
4. when total cases are less than 100, when you call someone you will hear about covid and how to keep yourself safe from it
5. then there is janta (voluntary) curfew
6. then 21days lock down
7. govt doing a lottttt....i mean a LOT, in my state both center and states doing great job
8. most of the male here use kerchief/napkin and ladies use scarf so covering their face is damn easy
9. Indians still remember 1918 flu because our grand parents used to tell about it that it washed off who villages too
10. most of indians stay in village and in my state, many villages have put fencing around their village so not even one person can enter

Thanks to other people, i am adding some more points

11.  the average age in india is 26, compared to 45 in Italy 

12. communities, villages informing police if they know about foreign returnees.

Now, i will tell you some more things

1. 2 people came back to my village and police coming everyday to make sure they don't leave the house and alternate MRO (some officer), police, doctor coming and taking their samples and everytime it is coming negative still they are in mandatory quarantine (think of just like jail)
2. in my city, one guy got +ve and whole area vacated with fear same and my place is very fast but i visited atleast 100 medical stores only to findout there are no masks and sanitisers.
3. in a nearby village, one army guy came back home in a train in which they found +ve patients and an ambulance came to pick this guy and their famiry for testing and local govt released a press note informing all the trains, bus this guy took with date and time so other people can contact for testing (or just be cautious about it)

so govt is doing very well and people too

now i have to other side of story

negative things

1. we had first case in jan so govt. had more time to prepare for it (i hope they made many plans without panicking ppl)
2. central govt. stressing about covid but states have taken it light, they were not doing proper screening at airports
3. Govt should have banned gulf planes too or atleast screens passengers from gulf
4. Large muslim gathering in march13-15th is definitely an intelligence failure and Govt found that none of foreign ppl said they are going for that meet (they mentioned other reasons like visiting country etc...)

I wanted to write a lot more but i hope this gives an idea why India faring/performing better than many other countries."

I have practiced self quarantine since late Feb, from knowing that the CDC refuses to test people here in states which causes a total collapse of my sense of security, which probably is false anyway. 

Before that when I went to workplace and share my anxiety, everyone thinks I am dramatic and overreacting and, you know, just an Asian thing. Speechless.

If you look, you will panic. The reason of inaction can only be there is no looking at all."

We’re doing alright here, but the surrounding recovery community is 12-step focused and so a lot of the new guys - the people that haven’t really worked a program long - are struggling hard. People with less than 3 months are relapsing like wildfire because all the meetings in town are shut down and lots of sponsors aren’t even meeting with people. There are zoom meetings for these things, but the addict in early recovery is still working out a lot of delusion and having that physical presence, accountability, and support available in town is what got a lot of us through the early months. We had a guy just randomly dip out and go home to relapse early last week. Another two guys did the same at another house nearby. Had a friend relapse, overdose, and die with his first shot of dope last Saturday. Those are just four people I personally know in my small town that fell through the cracks, gone, since Friday.

People with a decent amount of time are doing okayish because after a little while you don’t ~have to~ have the meetings, but even they are struggling. A big part of the 12 steps is to go help another addict and that’s become extra difficult with the social distancing in place. I know a few people that are trying to do service work by helping out directly with the problem itself. Others are deciding this is a little vacation from recovery, are not doing shit about their disease, not doing any extra work to fill the void of meetings and the fellowship, and falling into the abyss of the mental delusion that it’d be okay for them to just have a couple beers. Had a guy with over a year clean go back to shooting dope yesterday. Started off like a lot of other relapses do; “I’m just gonna smoke a little weed and drink some beer.” 

On the other hand, we’ve been having meetings at the house and doing various book studies/group meditations so a lot of us (in my house) are doing okay but I think we’re better off than a lot of others. Everybody’s started to get in a funk about it but we’re doing what we can to lift each other, and our community, up. I’m just so grateful personally that I have this support network and that - thank God - I’m sober and clean right now. Using during this time would be extra hell on top of the hell it already is."

The China of 2020 is no longer as closed as North Korea.  The China of 2020 is far more open, making it far more difficult to hide wide spread calamities.

This. I wouldn't trust ANY 'classified report' from the 'intelligence community' now in the midst of a pandemic. There's so much disinformation and (debunked) conspiracy theories out there. A fellow countryman of mine (Netherlands) migrated to China several years ago. Yes it's pretty authoritarian but it's not true that everyone is a brainless ccp party peon. It's not the DPRK, people have smartphones and internet and circumventing the Great Firewall is actually quite easy to do if you know the right VPN. My 2 cents:

* did china downplay it in the beginning? yes
* did they arrest the doctor in the beginning? yes. It's mainly the state who wants to control the flow of information. Healthcare workers in the US have been fired for speaking out as well. And yes, that's a disgrace.
* did they test everyone? no, that was clear from the beginning, lack of test kits
* is the number of true cases and deaths higher than the number of confirmed cases and deaths? absolutely.
* That Chinese doctor who seemed to be missing wasn't missing.
* did they purposefully hide tens or hundreds of thousands of CONFIRMED corona deaths, so confirmed cases who died? Unlikely. You need people to cover that up, including the deceased's relatives. So many people who have to play along perfectly.

Disclaimer: I don't like the CCP, but be careful with jumping to conclusions. In the midst of a disaster, people tend to look for scapegoats."

Life is not a beach these days, but that didn’t stop him.

A northern California emergency official took his family to the beach in defiance of a shelter-in-place order that he himself recommended, The Press Democrat reported.

Chris Godley, director of Emergency Management and leader of the Sonoma County, Calif.'s Emergency Operation Center, posted Chris Christie-like photos of him and his family at a closed beach in the county Saturday, according to The Press Democrat. The shelter-in-place order for Sonoma County has been in effect since March 18.

Godley did not order the shelter-in-place, but he did recommend it, local radio station KSRO reported.
 
“I own this,” Godley told The Press Democrat. “It was a day off for my family. Any reasoning or justification is going to sound thin.”

Numerous public officials interviewed by The Press Democrat defended Godley, while residents criticized him.
Sonoma County authorities said Friday that they planned to step up enforcement of the shelter-in-place order."

However, I also searched for scientific papers to see what the research indicated (which is a little all over the map to be honest). I finally decided that wearing a mask probably was better than not wearing a mask on a community level, especially since Taiwan and South Korea and other pro-mask countries had clearly had better outcomes than us.

Basically, we were lied to by **experts** and **government officials** who asked us to trust them and **still want us to trust them**. 

In any case, I've spent weeks now spamming [the Deaconess mask instructions](https://www.deaconess.com/How-to-make-a-Face-Mask?fbclid=IwAR1H25JhviFlqeBjj-LEwCUCGNf-PbJcst4fHxcnXOThUqoTk6CVQ8cuyRM) (the mask the hospital in Indiana asked home sewers to make for their healthcare workers) all over the place for anyone wanting to make their own.
