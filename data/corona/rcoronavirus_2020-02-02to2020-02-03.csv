I think NHS already at close to breaking point though so a large scale outbreak could cause knock on impacts. There isn't the resiliency there to deal with a pandemic level event.

Edit: when I say at breaking point - even before the virus my bro is overworked and exhausted and can't even deal with the cases they get.

I don't think anyone here feels that way. We just understand the numbers and understand that one likely possibility is that this will be a very bad pandemic. It isn't the only realistic possibility, but a pandemic simply isn't unrealistic, based on what is currently known. 

The official numbers, overall, in terms of Ro, incubation period, and growth of official cases so far are the worst seen in our lifetime. They seem especially bad when you realize that China is almost certainly lying about the mortality rate, although even the officially acknowledged two percent is really, really bad.

Nothing fancy, just old-fashioned bomb-shelter staples. Thanks to Amazon, stuff gets dropped in regular Amazon boxes, right at your door - you don’t even have to run to the store.

Here’s the thing, if you wait to see what’s going to happen, it will be too late. If it turns out this all blows over, you’ve got extra stuff you can store for some other event, and you won’t need to buy things like canned items, cereal, (shelf stable) milk for a while. Other than an upfront investment, there’s not really much of a downside, as you can eat the stuff in either case.

However, I would not want to wakeup to find myself inside a mandatory quarantine zone, as tens of millions in China currently are, wondering how, or even if, I can safely get to the supermarket to feed my kids."

2020-02-02,LeftistsAreBigots,Coronavirus,15,https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/exuvzx/mortality_rates_corona_21_and_flu_08/fgcv9mf/,"That 2.1 number may be very low, I hate to break it to you.  There is a 5-7 day lag between infection and when the virus tends to kill, so you should probably be calculating number of confirmed deaths by the number of confirmed cases from 5-7 DAYS AGO, not today.  I don't suggest doing that math, the number is not reassuring.

Think of it this way... during the first week, nobody died because symptoms hadn't peaked yet.  Does that mean the virus is non fatal?  No, it obviously does not.

[https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.01.27.20018952v1.full.pdf](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.01.27.20018952v1.full.pdf)

This shows a possible mortality rate of 6.5 based on that type of modeling.

And before the cries of BuT ItS nOt PeEr ReviEwEd!!!... look, NOTHING about this is going to be peer reviewed for weeks to months, you're misunderstanding the point of the peer review process and how it relates to a situation like this, these are PRELIMINARY STUDIES.  Is this 100% settled and guaranteed to be perfectly accurate? No, of course not, but this is the data given by different types of modeling as it becomes available, this is a rapidly developing situation and researchers are scrambling to figure out what is actually going on and how bad this actually is.

Now, if you use that 5-7 day number on the data given on the Johns Hopkins page, you find a far scarier number if you take TODAYS confirmed fatalities compared to the confirmed fatalities from 5-7 days ago, and it pushes to around 14.  So as of right now, that looks to be worst case scenario, but will likely not reflect the final mortality rate after containment and new treatments become put fully into play.

EDIT: Sorry for the edits, again, super underslept and reading through the morning rush of new info.  Got a little mixed up with studies at first, but that's the correct one."

Over my 20+ years living in China, I have never met anyone who eats wild animals or dogs/cats. My family and friends lived their whole live as civil as possible, as kind and responsible as possible. Yet now their lives are in danger, and the world is accusing Chinese people as a whole, when it's only a small portion of the billions of the population who caused the problem. It's heartbreaking reading the news everyday and reading the harsh words on the internet on all Chinese. And some out of content fake news. But at the same time, I understand, news don't care about the billions of normal people, news only report the ones that are ""news worthy"".

As of now, there is NO reason to believe this virus is zoonotic between humans and pets.

Unfortunately what IS likely is that the virus survives for up to hours or days on surfaces, which would include the surface of your pet.  If your pet is being touched, someone infected could leave viral particles on it.  If other people pet it, they could transfer the virus to themselves.  If the pet is free to roam the house... you have a virus dispenser wandering around your home and shaking viruses off of itself and all over your furniture, carpet, and family.  That is not CONFIRMED, but it's likely.

What is for sure though, even if someone in your house had the virus, if you keep the rabbit in the cage, and nobody touches it until this blows over, there is NO RISK to the your family posed by the rabbit.  Please do not needlessly kill this rabbit.

If the mortality rates which have been quoted are at all correct, we know the overwhelming majority of people who get this are going to eventually end up recovered. If for arguments sake the mortality rate is 3%, then logically, 4-6 weeks from now there are going to be 16500 odd people from the current confirmed infections recovered.

Flu is worldwide already so more people are exposed to it than this coronavirus so far, and a well known disease. Those statistics are also covering a whole year.

With this coronavirus we are only seeing statistics for the short time it has existed, and it has only begun to spread. Right now we don’t know the death rate (although certainly significantly higher than flu), we don’t know how infectious it is, and we don’t have any vaccines for it. 

You also don’t see hospitals running out of supplies and beds for flu outbreaks. 

The flu may kill more people in an average year so far, but keep in mind that this disease has only just emerged. It is not a good comparison to look at the flu which is a well established and common disease. As it spreads, and if the spread of the virus can not be contained, it has the potential to kill many more people than the flu, and severely sicken many more including young healthy people."

Forced quaratine is more or less detention, if you run out of quarantine rooms or ""detention cells"" you must improvise. Try quarantine 11million people, especially if some people refuse to be quarantined (maybe the case). 
Also, they have smartphone, internet access,  electricity, water and also a big gap between door and welded bar (that makes trivial to brute force your scape with tools you have at home). Any better idea how to enforce quarantine if someone refuses to stay at home?.

Now it's a virus that can infect snakes, with a strain that can infect humans, or humans AND snakes.  This mutation would not automatically confer the ability to transfer to chickens or rhinos or cats or anything else.  Some other mutation might, and if the snake that was host to that mutant form of the virus were kept in close quarters to whatever species, then it might be able to jump to a new population.  Does that make sense?  Zoonotic does not does not mean it can now infect every animal.

This particular type of virus mutates all the time, though, generally not mutations of any particular benefit to the virus, they're just random errors when the virus replicates.  Each one of those is a roll of the dice, and at some point one of those errors can lead to a mutation that is beneficial to the spread of the virus.  The code is fairly complex though, so the probability of that happening in any one replication is incredibly low.  Unfortunately, there are trillions upon trillions of those replications happening in a variety of hosts and environments when the virus has spread enough, and each one of those is a roll of the dice, that's part of why it's important to stop these things early on, and maintain effective quarantine procedures."

I also believe the average 5 day window of incubation/transmission, would give us 3 good cycles within a two week period.  

If the disease is allowed to roam freely within 2 weeks, 3 cycles would see cases at least 10x what they are now outside China.  So about 150 today, in 2 weeks would be at least 1,500.

2020-02-02,tseiniaidd,Coronavirus,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/exu1zc/wuhan_coronavirus_looks_increasingly_like_a/fgd2ghi/,"The Wuhan coronavirus spreading from China is now likely to become a pandemic that circles the globe, according to many of the world’s leading infectious disease experts.

The prospect is daunting. A pandemic — an ongoing epidemic on two or more continents — may well have global consequences, despite the extraordinary travel restrictions and quarantines now imposed by China and other countries, including the United States.

Scientists do not yet know how lethal the new coronavirus is, however, so there is uncertainty about how much damage a pandemic might cause. But there is growing consensus that the pathogen is readily transmitted between humans.

The Wuhan coronavirus is spreading more like influenza, which is highly transmissible, than like its slow-moving viral cousins, SARS and MERS, scientists have found.

“It’s very, very transmissible, and it almost certainly is going to be a pandemic,” said Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease.

“But will it be catastrophic? I don’t know.”

In the last three weeks, the number of lab-confirmed cases has soared from about 50 in China to 14,000 in 23 countries; there have been over 300 deaths, all but one in China.

But various epidemiological models estimate that the real number of cases is 100,000 or even more. While that expansion is not as rapid as that of flu or measles, it is an enormous leap beyond what virologists saw when SARS and MERS emerged.

When SARS was vanquished in July 2003 after spreading for nine months, only 8,098 cases had been confirmed. MERS has been circulating since 2012, but there have been only about 2,500 known cases.

How Bad Will the Coronavirus Outbreak Get? Here Are 6 Key Factors
Here’s what early research says about how the pathogen behaves and the factors that will determine whether it can be contained.
Jan. 31, 2020

The biggest uncertainty now, experts said, is how many people around the world will die. SARS killed about 10 percent of those who got it, and MERS now kills about one of three.

The 1918 “Spanish flu” killed only about 2.5 percent of its victims — but because it infected so many people and medical care was much cruder then, 20 to 50 million died.

By contrast, the highly transmissible H1N1 “swine flu” pandemic of 2009 killed about 285,000, fewer than seasonal flu normally does, and had a relatively low fatality rate, estimated at .02 percent.

The mortality rate for known cases of the Wuhan coronavirus has been running about 2 percent, although that is likely to drop as more tests are done and more mild cases are found.

It is “increasingly unlikely that the virus can be contained,” said Dr. Thomas R. Frieden, a former director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention who now runs Resolve to Save Lives, a nonprofit devoted to fighting epidemics.

“It is therefore likely that it will spread, as flu and other organisms do, but we still don’t know how far, wide or deadly it will be.”

In the early days of the 2009 flu pandemic, “they were talking about Armageddon in Mexico,” Dr. Fauci said. (That virus first emerged in pig-farming areas in Mexico’s Veracruz State.) “But it turned out to not be that severe.”

An accurate estimate of the virus’s lethality will not be possible until certain kinds of studies can be done: blood tests to see how many people have antibodies, household studies to learn how often it infects family members, and genetic sequencing to determine whether some strains are more dangerous than others.

Closing borders to highly infectious pathogens never succeeds completely, experts said, because all frontiers are somewhat porous. Nonetheless, closings and rigorous screening may slow the spread, which will buy time for the development of drug treatments and vaccines.

Other important unknowns include who is most at risk, whether coughing or contaminated surfaces are more likely to transmit the virus, how fast the virus can mutate and whether it will fade out when the weather warms.


Coronavirus Map: Tracking the Spread of the Outbreak
The virus has sickened more than 14,600 people in China and 23 other countries.

The effects of a pandemic would probably be harsher in some countries than in others. While the United States and other wealthy countries may be able to detect and quarantine the first carriers, countries with fragile health care systems will not. The virus has already reached Cambodia, India, Malaysia, Nepal, the Philippines and rural Russia.

“This looks far more like H1N1’s spread than SARS, and I am increasingly alarmed,” said Dr. Peter Piot, director of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine. “Even 1 percent mortality would mean 10,000 deaths in each million people.”

Other experts were more cautious.

Dr. Michael Ryan, head of emergency responses for the World Health Organization, said in an interview with STAT News on Saturday that there was “evidence to suggest this virus can still be contained” and that the world needed to “keep trying.”

Dr. W. Ian Lipkin, a virus-hunter at the Columbia University Mailman School of Public Health who is in China advising its Center for Disease Control and Prevention, said that although the virus is clearly being transmitted through casual contact, labs are still behind in processing samples.

But life in China has radically changed in the last two weeks. Streets are deserted, public events are canceled, and citizens are wearing masks and washing their hands, Dr. Lipkin said. All of that may have slowed down what lab testing indicated was exponential growth in the infection.

It’s unclear exactly how accurate tests done in overwhelmed Chinese laboratories are. On the one hand, Chinese state media have reported test kit shortages and processing bottlenecks, which could produce an undercount.

But Dr. Lipkin said he knew of one lab running 5,000 samples a day, which might produce some false-positive results, inflating the count. “You can’t possibly do quality control at that rate,” he said.

Anecdotal reports from China, and one published study from Germany, indicate that some people infected with the Wuhan coronavirus can pass it on before they show symptoms. That may make border-screening much harder, scientists said.

Epidemiological modeling released Friday by the European Center for Disease Prevention and Control estimated that 75 percent of infected people reaching Europe from China would still be in the incubation periods upon arrival, and therefore not detected by airport screening, which looks for fevers, coughs and breathing difficulties.

But if thermal cameras miss victims who are beyond incubation and actively infecting others, the real number of missed carriers may be higher than 75 percent.

Still, asymptomatic carriers “are not normally major drivers of epidemics,” Dr. Fauci said. Most people get ill from someone they know to be sick — a family member, a co-worker or a patient, for example.

The virus’s most vulnerable target is Africa, many experts said. More than 1 million expatriate Chinese work there, mostly on mining, drilling or engineering projects. Also, many Africans work and study in China and other countries where the virus has been found.

If anyone on the continent has the virus now, “I’m not sure the diagnostic systems are in place to detect it,” said Dr. Daniel Bausch, head of scientific programs for the American Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene, who is consulting with the W.H.O. on the outbreak.

South Africa and Senegal could probably diagnose it, he said. Nigeria and some other countries have asked the W.H.O. for the genetic materials and training they need to perform diagnostic tests, but that will take time.

At least four African countries have suspect cases quarantined, according to an article published Friday in The South China Morning Post. They have sent samples to France, Germany, India and South Africa for testing.

At the moment, it seems unlikely that the virus will spread widely in countries with vigorous, alert public health systems, said Dr. William Schaffner, a preventive medicine specialist at Vanderbilt University Medical Center.

“Every doctor in the U.S. has this top of mind,” he said. “Any patient with fever or respiratory problems will get two questions. ‘Have you been to China? Have you had contact with anyone who has?’ If the answer is yes, they’ll be put in isolation right away.”

Assuming the virus spreads globally, tourism to and trade with countries besides China may be affected — and the urgency to find ways to halt the virus and prevent deaths will grow.

It is possible that the Wuhan coronavirus will fade out as weather warms. Many viruses, like flu, measles and norovirus, thrive in cold, dry air. The SARS outbreak began in winter, and MERS transmission also peaks then, though that may be related to transmission in newborn camels.

Four mild coronaviruses cause about a quarter of the nation’s common colds, which also peak in winter.

But even if an outbreak fades in June, there could be a second wave in the fall, as has occurred in every major flu pandemic, including those that began in 1918 and 2009."

This shit is absolutely infuriating, and I hope it stops.

Unless you live under a rock or are incredibly naive, you already know that NOTHING is a 100% guarantee. 

We DO know, based on countless peer-reviewed medical studies and journal articles, that both hand sanitizer and face masks SIGNIFICANTLY reduce ones chances of contracting viruses. Even if a face mask only prevented you from touching your face with your hands, that STILL drastically reduces your chances of contracting the virus. Even if hand sanitizer killed only 40-70% of whatever is on your hands, that’s still massively reducing your chances of contracting something. 

Everything helps. Nothing is 100%. People need to stop spreading media-fuelled propaganda."

>Pandemic influenza planning in the UK is based on an assessment of the  
‘reasonable worst case’ derived from experience and a mathematical analysis of  
seasonal influenza and previous pandemics. The national planning assumptions are  
described in detail in the DH-authored UK Influenza Pandemic Preparedness  
Strategy 2011, which in summary indicates that:  
• up to 50% of the population could experience symptoms of pandemic  
influenza  
• during one or more pandemic waves  
• lasting 15 weeks  
• although the nature and severity of the symptoms would vary from person to  
person  
Analysis of previous pandemics suggests that we should plan for up to 2.5% of those  
with symptoms dying as a result of influenza, assuming no effective treatment was  
available. It is recognised that the combination of high attack rates (as described  
above) and a severe disease is relatively (but unquantifiably) improbable and also  
that there are a range of countermeasures and interventions available and  
consequently suggests planning for a lower level of population mortality is sensible.  
Therefore the NHS should ensure plans are flexible and scalable for a range of  
impacts."

People are so out of touch with reality, it's almost amusing.  The problems China are dealing with this very moment are going to have wide reaching economic issues all over the world.  The flu has never caused the price of LCD panels to go up or flights to be cancelled and travel restrictions put in place.

But yeah, we are all concerned about nothing.  We are lucky to have you, OP, the wise one that remained calm and cool throughout this entire global catastrophe. OP will go down in history for being the one true white knight who protected Chinese people from discrimination, which is the biggest problem we face right now.

You are doing the latter, and it is racist. In the US there have been voluntary quarantines in place for a week, and involuntary quarantines for a few days.

Everyone who flew from Wuhan has been tracked by the CDC for symptoms and everyone who interacted with them was warned to keep an eye out for symptoms and report immediately to a doctor.

CDC rates the rate of asymptomatic transmission as low and not likely to cause an epidemic (not saying it doesn't happen, but the likelihood you get it at any time is low due to lower viral counts and less vectors for transmission).

If you're so worried, quarantine yourself, stop riding Ubers, stop going outside/etc, and tell a doctor in 5 days if you feel like crap."

Their only responsibility is to get you medically stable. An ICU stay without insurance will bankrupt most Americans. For profit healthcare is a pretty damaging system in a pandemic. The main issue being most people with lacking or no insurance won’t go to the Dr for minor symptoms because they don’t want to pay $200+ for cold/flu like symptoms visit/viral culture. Couple that with many working jobs that offer no paid sick leave. You have many showing up for work and not getting tested for virus perpetuating it’s spread because they simply can’t afford to stay home. Also not seeking care until the infection is further along causing more strain on healthcare providers dealing with sicker patients than if they’d come in sooner. People bitch about bringing up politics in this subreddit but the fact Trump cut CDC funding by 20% and hasn’t staffed many of the agencies that deal with this stuff does pertain to the Coronavirus outbreak. Conservative policies will cause a worsened outcome if this becomes an actual major outbreak in the states. Good luck everybody...

What’s surprising is, even though it looks like a lot of food, when you tally up caloric consumption across two adults and two kids (3 and 5 yo), it’s only 3 weeks, and that’s assuming no vigorous activity.

I also have a big generator, with house tap and breakout, that I can run my whole house on.

As I've said repeatedly, we are only able to rely on the following:  leaked audio and video, analysis of the situation by medical experts (which often do not agree with each other), and PRELIMINARY studies, none of which are going to be peer reviewed.  If the virus is even in the median range of predictions as far as transmission rate and mortality rate... it will have overrun many countries while people wait on a peer review study before they take any action.

Experts don't say 2%, because that would be just dividing the deceased by the current confirmed infected, but it doesnt keep into account the infection lag. Meaning, some of the currently infected might die 5 days from now. 
Also, it's based on incomplete data. 

Virologists never said that it's 2%, we simply don't know exactly what the mortality rate is.

To clarify, if mortality was 10% with 5 days of delay from symptoms to death, the official data would still be compatible with it. But we don't know. And that is scary my friend.
And also. Official Chinese data is garbage. 

You can look at this video from an epidemiologist explaining exactly what mortality rate is for sars and coronavirus

It's very clearly a new strain. But I guess we should be clear what I mean by 'new strain'.  That basically means it's a new strain directly from bats (or some other reserve animal) and not a version that mutated from a previous human outbreak. If this was a mutated version of the SARS that hit humans years ago, then it'd be closer to SARS on the tree. It's clearly a new strain acquired directly from bats or through an intermediary.

I'm installing a hand gel dispenser just inside my small apartment building's front door. It's cheap to buy a 5l bottle of hand gel refill online, but local stores are all out of stock. I told my neighbours to let me know if they need topping up. I figured keeping those close to me well stocked will reduce my risks too! Also, I just really like my neighbours and want them to be safe. 😅

Most of us have stocked up on food and water. I had stuff prepped anyway, but upped my game a little last week. I shared my spare 3ply masks with my neighbours who are at higher risk of coming into contact with the virus (teacher, shop assistant, uber driver).

We take care of each other here, but just in case things get spicy, I ordered a door jammer.

I also picked up quite a few 150hr pillar candles, in case of blackouts way down the line. Should help a little with warmth too. I have a good supply of non-electronic stuff to do as well, like knitting, yoga, books, and calligraphy. I'm sure the power will be fine, but I like to be prepared, as the boredom would kill me faster than any virus!

Don't forget multivitamins! Scurvy is the last thing you want if you're stuck in quarantine. 

MEDICALLY: 

-Anti pyretics (paracetamol/acetaminophen etc)

-Mucus cough meds (Guafenesin)

-Lung steamer/nebulizer

-Stethoscope to listen out for telltale bubbling sounds

-Inexpensive SpO2 monitor

-Decent thermometer

You panic, because these are some fast-spreading ants. Super ants!

The next day, you see your kid transplanting ants from a colony to your house. You breathe a sigh of relief-- not because you don't have ants (you still have ants) but because they're not super ants.

The best explanation for the numbers before the revelation of asymptomatic spreading was plain old virulence. And this thing was looking pretty nasty with that explanation.

To use another metaphor: We thought it was a very fast runner, but it just had an unseen head start. This is a relief in the sense that it's not as fast of a runner as we thought."

So I think, after China and India, one of the most dangerous cities to have a virus outbreak is here. So after having this said, the positive thing I can take from the numbers of contagions outside China is that maybe this is not going to be so big.

The rest of the world has developed rules, cultural, religious, scientific, to avoid these types of problems because it's been well known for centuries that certain hygenic practices (or lack thereof) can cause disease, as can eating certain meats over others. That's why we have sanitation standards. That's why you cannot legally sell wild game in any 1st world market, anywhere. That's why jews have Kashrut for thousands of years, and why muslims have Halal for hundreds.   


China is the only place that doesn't have these standards. And it is why nearly every outbreak of major disease comes from china, for centuries, going back as far as the bubonic plauge and even earlier plauges.   


let me ask you something - is expecting people to wash their hands xenophobic?   


Did you see a single hand washing station, or gloved hand in that market?   


Have you been to china? I suggest you walk into any random restaurant and check the bathroom. 99 times out of 100, you will not find soap. This is because chinese people do not use soap. It is counter intuitive and unnecessary to the mentality held by the vast majority of china's population.   


And furthermore, with all your liberal posturing, how do you feel about endagered species? because that market is full of them, as are most markets in china, who is responsible for hunting hundreds of animals into extinction. All of which is based on theories of ""traditional chinese medicine"" which is in fact an abberation of actual ""traditional"" chinese systems, with most of it invented by the PLA under Mao.   


TLDR; you're the biggest fucking moron, most hypocritically xenophobic, lacking in self awareness, liberal baizuo, uneducated, untraveled, brainwashed piece of virtue signaling garbage have ever come across."

By that time, some remedies might be on hand, although they will need rigorous testing and perhaps political pressure to make them available and affordable.

In China, several antiviral drugs are being prescribed. A common combination is pills containing lopinavir and ritonavir with infusions of interferon, a signaling protein that wakes up the immune system.

In the United States, the combination is sold as Kaletra by AbbVie for H.I.V. therapy, and it is relatively expensive. In India, a dozen generic makers produce the drugs at rock-bottom prices for use against H.I.V. in Africa, and their products are W.H.O.-approved.

Another option may be an experimental drug, remdesivir, on which the patent is held by Gilead. The drug has not yet been approved for use against any disease. Nonetheless, there is some evidence that it works against coronaviruses, and Gilead has donated doses to China.

Several American companies are working on a vaccine, using various combinations of their own funds, taxpayer money and foundation grants.

Although modern gene-chemistry techniques have made it possible to build vaccine candidates within just days, medical ethics require that they then be carefully tested on animals and small numbers of healthy humans for safety and effectiveness.

That aspect of the process cannot be sped up, because dangerous side effects may take time to appear and because human immune systems need time to produce the antibodies that show whether a vaccine is working.

Whether or not what is being tried in China will be acceptable elsewhere will depend on how rigorously Chinese doctors run their clinical trials.

Coronaviruses are a group of viruses that cause diseases in mammals and birds. In humans, the viruses cause respiratory infections which are typically mild, including the common cold; however, rarer forms such as SARS, MERS and the novel coronavirus causing the current outbreak can be lethal. In cows and pigs they may cause diarrhea, while in chickens they can cause an upper respiratory disease. There are no vaccines or antiviral drugs that are approved for prevention or treatment.

Inflammation is a natural response to infection or injury where white blood cells and/or platelets are flooded to an area they are needed. The problem is that when alveoli become inflamed, they lose some of their ability to diffuse oxygen into the bloodstream, making it hard to breath. If the immune system is able to fight off the infection, the swelling will go down. if a persons immune system is too weak (low in T-cells and White blood cells), the swelling will be too great for them to be able to breath. it is also possible for the person to become septic, which is when the viral infection fills the bloodstream resulting in inflammation in multiple organs, which is often fatal"
