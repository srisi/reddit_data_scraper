Some fun excerpts:

“‘I’ve been trying to dole out nudity on my account in really thoughtful ways,’ she tells me. ‘I thought, Wouldn’t this be an interesting and fascinating moment to make it even harder for people to see my brains?’”

...

“Following in the footsteps of a lot of women who want cash during quarantine, it’s not clear how she’ll use the platform yet, but it’s likely that for the $49.99 a month (the highest per month payment option the site allows), fans will gain access to Polaroid nudes of Calloway paired with her notoriously long, memoir-istic captions about her pussy being like an orchid. (As for posting content as risque as crotch shots, Calloway says, “I’m not excited about it for the price of $50 a month. I’m not saying I’d never do that, but it’d be way more expensive; I’m not sure how many people could even afford to see my pussy.”) Calloway tells me that in the two days since she announced her launch on OnlyFans, she’s on pace to make $80,000 in a year — much needed since she self-published her memoir — and says she donated all $40,000 of the proceeds to coronavirus relief.”

...

“She was planning to take her brand in a sexualized direction for a long time and claims she was even slated to shoot a nipples out, “no pussy” pictorial for Playboy this spring, conceptualized around the image of her as a naughty schoolgirl in a gothic library, based off the concept of her book that never was. (Late Wednesday night, a Playboy representative emailed me the following: “Playboy does not have and did not have any photo shoot planned with Caroline Calloway.” It probably doesn’t matter anyway: In mid-March, the company announced plans to shutter its print magazine.)”

...

“In her mind, posting a nude during a global pandemic — and then launching an OnlyFans account the same day she drops a violently graphic chapter about her father’s death — just kinda makes sense.”"

Recently, there was a protest organized by a politically conservative group near the capitol building of Michigan intended to express opposition to the governor's recent decisions regarding the executive order in response to the COVID-19 virus. It was organized on Facebook, where attendees were told to stay in their cars and use their horns or hold signs during the protest. Source: (auto-mod removed the link to the original FB page, but you can look it up if you choose)

When the protest took place, a group of protestors ignored the Facebook page's instructions and got out of their cars to protest in person on the lawn of the capitol. In addition to this, people expressed concern over the traffic jam blocking access to the entrance of the nearby hospital. A Sparrow spokesperson John Foren said there are no access problems and ambulances can “get in and out. There’s no problem.” However, he also acknowledged concerns about ambulances being caught up in traffic on the way to the hospital.

While the protestors did not block the actual entrance to the hospital, the traffic jams did reportedly interrupt local transportation's ability to accommodate life-sustaining and medically necessary trips in the area. Source: https://twitter.com/RideCATA/status/1250491770288459778?s=20

For context on the protests, [this article](https://www.npr.org/sections/coronavirus-live-updates/2020/04/15/835250693/michigan-stay-at-home-order-prompts-honking-traffic-jam-protest) does a good job of explaining the reasons people are mad at the governor.

""The new version of the order banned travel between homes and didn't grant exemptions for workers like landscapers, whom politicians argue can work while remaining socially distant. Protesters were also upset that normal life has been shut down all over the state.

As of Monday, more than a quarter of the state's workforce had filed for unemployment benefits.

But not all parts of the state have been equally affected by the outbreak. Southeast Michigan and Detroit remain a hotspot — claiming the lion's share of COVID-19 cases and deaths.

Opponents like Shelly Vanderwerff argue there should be regional and industry-based exemptions. She caravanned to Lansing from west Michigan, where she was recently laid off from her work at a local greenhouse."""

Edit; I wasn’t being entirely correct, it’s more that the WHO favours their image over some health policies. Because they believe that will mean they get to save more lives later on, but they have a history of pandering to governments to make them happy at what is arguably a too great of cost.

>Vice: Shocking new data shows that along with the 95 percent increase in child porn consumption, there’s also been a 200 percent spike in searches for videos

>>ICPF: 95% --> Data  from  Pornhub,  the  largest  pornography  website  in  the  world,  shows  that  traffic  from India on its website has increased by 95% between 24thand 26thMarch 2020, as compared to their average traffic, pre-Coronavirus. 

95% is OVERALL porn search, not just CP. 


>>ICPF: 200% --> The demand for child pornography was an average of 5 million per month in 100 cities and only on the public web. A vast majority of individuals were interested in generic CSAM content involving ‘school girls sex’, the demand for content with specific age groups, sexual actions and locations was growing as much as 200%.

So CSAM is CP. So 200% is 3x of 5 million, so 15 million. Of what? individuals or search hits? Unclear.

>>EastMojo: Ananya Chakraborty, chairperson of West Bengal Commission for Protection of Child Rights (WBCPCR), said that globally, child abuse and trafficking increases in times of calamity, whether it is floods or earthquakes, or war, and this (COVID-19 outbreak) is a calamity.  [...] Parents are also advised to do joint activities with children and engage them in a meaningful way. Parents should be vigilant and track the internet usage of children. They should also take advantage of parental controls in computer, mobile devices and make their social media accounts private.

>>While the government machinery is focused on thwarting the spread of the coronavirus, criminals and predators anywhere in the world can exploit the closure of schools and increased usage of internet by children. In case of West Bengal, the commission already has a guideline on how to stay safe online. “We’ll share it again in our social media handles to aware parents as well as vulnerable groups,” said the WBCPCR chairperson.

Talking about taking precautionary measures.

Go to a rougher part of Tokyo at night (maybe not now during the coronavirus quarantine) and watch a fight between some drunk tough types and you can bet you'll hear more than your share of てめえ　貴様　◯◯しやがって、こら！！ and other colorful language.

It's not that these phrases are *only* used in anime (or yakuza movies), it's that beginning learners who are watching this sort of media (1) don't have the experience or background to judge when this sort of language is appropriate, (2) are basically never going to find themselves in a situation where it's called for, and (3) wouldn't have the overall language ability to use it properly even if they did.

It can be possible to jokingly use 貴様, この野郎, etc. to a friend (the way we might say ""you bastard"" or ""m\*\*\*\*\*f\*\*\*\*\*\*"" to a friend), but again, if you have the language ability to do that in an effective, natural way, you probably already know how to do it and don't need to ask on Reddit.

Tl;dr: There's really no such thing as ""anime-only"" Japanese phrases, unless we're talking about made-up words (造語) specifically invented for a fantasy or sci-fi world, or weird speech quirks invented for a particular character. The words you mention (or exaggerated phrasing in general) is typically referred to as ""anime Japanese"" to discourage low-level learners from just mimicking what they hear on TV in a way that would be awkward at best or insulting at worst in 99% of the actual conversations they'll find themselves in."

They are still trying to cover SARs up in 2020.

The Chinese government is like that friend who sleeps on your couch and eats all your food, doesn't pay you rent, breaks all the shit in your house, denies all responsibility, and that also tries to control every aspect of your life.

We would be better off cutting all ties with China and stop fueling them economically because we're addicted to consumerism and cheap crap.

>He was suffering from the chills, dry cough and breathlessness.

>Airport officials quickly moved him to hospital in the city of Trivandrum in Kerala state, where they tested him for coronavirus.

>Then they put him in an ambulance and sent him home to his village in Kasargod district, some 564 km (350 miles) away.

>Chengala is a cluster of four wooded settlements where 66,000 people live. Most are engaged in farming paddy and vegetables.

>Many others, like the young salesman, are among the more than two million people from Kerala who work outside the country, including in the Gulf states.

>When the man reached Chengala, local village council members immediately reached out and the local public health centre took down his details.

>They asked him to isolate himself from his wife and three children. So the man began living alone in a shed outside his house.

>Six days later, his test came back as positive. By that time, he was already in isolation in his home. Later, he was taken to hospital, where he recovered. After returning home, the salesman is still living in isolation ""just for safety"".

>""We were ready from the very beginning. We realised a storm was coming. So we began erecting our defences,"" Shahina Saleem, the president of the 23-member local village council, told me. These elected village councils are the lowest tier of governance in India.

>Over the last month, Chengala has reported 22 cases of Covid-19 infection and quarantined more than 400 people. Twenty patients have recovered in hospital and returned home. More than 370 samples have been tested at hospitals some 8km away. Results usually arrive in 48 hours.

>The local village council galvanised local health and community workers and opened a community kitchen to feed the people in isolation.

>They have been providing free lunches for more than 1,200 people in the area - local residents and stranded migrant workers. Local health officers are making sure that villagers on medication get their pills on time.

>Using a local helpline and two WhatsApp groups, the council encouraged local villagers to accommodate people who were in isolation and didn't have enough space for social distancing at home. Two-dozen families vacated floors and even homes for this. Everyone in isolation now has to observe a 28-day quarantine.

>Kerala, many believe, has turned out to be a striking outlier in the battle against the virus in India. The world's second-most populous country has reported more than 9,750 cases and 377 deaths from the contagion so far.

>In the beginning, the odds seemed to be stacked against the picturesque southern state, which is a major tourist location. In January, it reported the first Covid-19 case in India. The number of cases rose steadily, and it became a hotspot. Two months later, half a dozen states are reporting more infections than Kerala.

>Kerala has porous borders, a large number of migrant workers, and a huge expatriate population who keep travelling back and forth and whose remittances oil the state's economy.

>More than two months after the outbreak of the pandemic, the state has reported three deaths and more than 370 confirmed cases of the infection. More than 100,000 people remain in isolation, at home or in designated facilities.

>Many believe Kerala has flattened the curve at a time when the infection is on the rise all over India.

>To be sure, the state has been alert and vigilant. It imposed a lockdown a day before the nationwide one, on 25 March. It did rigorous contact tracing, using detailed ""route maps"" of people coming in from abroad. It set up Covid-19 care centres in all districts to accommodate outsiders who were stuck and had been advised to isolate.

>Health workers supported people with special needs and the elderly living alone. Counsellors made more than 340,000 telephone calls to personnel working in affected areas to counsel them on how to handle stress.

>It's not that Kerala tested aggressively. Testing was bound strictly by and limited to federal protocols. More than a dozen labs are testing 800 samples a day.

>But, experts say, what really mattered in the end was Kerala's robust public health system, and a culture of thriving grassroots democracy with power devolving effectively to the village councils. This mainly helped in community outreach, rigorous contact tracing and mass quarantine. The Communist government released abundant information about the developments every day, analysts say.

>""A strong game-changer was the decentralised health care system. And village councils took upon themselves to enforce and monitor mass quarantine with the consent of the people. The shutdown also helped,"" B Ekbal, a neurosurgeon and head of an expert panel advising the government on prevention of the virus, told me.

>Economists like Jacob John believe that the devolution of power in Kerala - local government, community-driven village councils, vigilant municipalities - have helped the state tackle two consecutive floods and an outbreak of the vicious Nipah virus in the last three years.

>The three-tier public health system, involving functioning government hospitals, is the result of a more than half-century long legacy of spending on healthcare. ""Kerala,"" says Dr John, ""has spent more on health and education than most Indian states.""

>Breathless media reports of Kerala ""flattening the curve"" could be premature, officials warn.

>Like in the rest of India, much of the testing has been limited and delayed.

>Mass screening with antibody tests has been delayed because about 100,000 kits which the state ordered haven't arrived yet.

>Fresh cases haven't dried up completely. Kerala also ""got lucky"", as one doctor told me - the average age of infected people here is 37 years old, and the majority of them are Gulf returnees.

>""It's not counter-intuitive. Some 70% of our Covid-19 patients have come from outside the country,"" says Dr Ekbal. This in a state where more than 12% of the population are over 60 years old.

>Also, worryingly, Kerala has one of the highest rates of communicable diseases - one that spreads from one person to another - in India. A large number of people also suffer from diabetes, heart diseases, respiratory and liver diseases.

>The summer monsoon rains, which begin in June, usually trigger a spike in diseases like influenza, dengue and scrub typhus. Fever is a common symptom in many of these diseases. ""This can complicate diagnosis. To make sure we don't end up facing a fresh wave of infections during the rains, we have to very vigilant during the monsoon,"" says a doctor.

>Such heightened vigilance - controlling inflows of people across the border and isolating suspects - will come at an economic cost. The government has worked out a painstakingly detailed plan for the phased opening up of the state when infections stop.

>So far Kerala has stuck to the script and done it well it, say analysts. Cases have slowed down, recoveries are high and the mortality rate is low. It helped that it had a smaller population (33 million) than many other states and also a highly literate one.

>""We have won the quarter-final,"" says Sreejith N Kumar, a doctor. ""The semi-final would be a staggered easing up without a second wave of infection. And the final would be a return to normal life.""

>""Only then we can say we won the game.""

>Have you been getting these songs wrong?

>What happens to your body in extreme heat?"

Ue, Macron: “È il momento della verità, senza un fondo che emetta debito comune il progetto rischia di crollare e vinceranno i populisti”

Intervistato dal Financial times, il presidente francese ha detto che ora si decide ""se l'Unione è un progetto politico o solo un progetto di mercato"". Se non diventerà realtà il Recovery fund proposto dalla Francia e appoggiato da Roma ""i populisti vinceranno oggi, domani, dopodomani, in Italia, in Spagna, forse in Francia e altrove"". Come quando ""cento anni fa la Francia, dopo la fine della prima Guerra mondiale, disse che la Germania doveva pagare"" le riparazioni: ""un errore colossale, fatale"". Poi ""ci fu il piano Marshall e la gente ne parla ancora oggi""

“È ora di pensare l’impensabile“, titola il Financial Times. E’ la sintesi del pensiero di Emmanuel Macron: intervistato dal quotidiano finanziario nel giorno in cui l’Europarlamento sta votando una risoluzione a favore dei Recovery bond, il presidente francese avverte che l’Ue chiamata a prendere decisioni per rispondere ai danni economici del coronavirus è di fronte a un “momento della verità“. Il momento in cui “decidere se l’Unione europea è un progetto politico o solo un progetto di mercato“. Riecheggiando gli appelli di Giuseppe Conte e Pedro Sanchez alla solidarietà, Macron ammonisce che se non appoggerà le economie più colpite come quella dell’Italia il progetto politico rischia di crollare.

Il presidente francese ricorda che “ogni volta che nella storia abbiamo affrontato una situazione del genere abbiamo fatto errori. Cento anni fa la Francia, dopo la fine della prima Guerra mondiale, disse che la Germania doveva pagare” le riparazioni. “Errore colossale, fatale, che provocò la reazione populistatedesca e l’odio nel resto d’Europa e 15 anni”. Ma “alla fine della Seconda guerra mondiale non ripetemmo l’errore, ci fu il piano Marshall e la gente ne parla ancora oggi”.
“Se ora non facciamo questo – spiega riferendosi al fondo finanziato condebito comune proposto dalla Francia e appoggiato da Roma – io vi dico che i populisti vinceranno. Oggi, domani, dopodomani, in Italia, in Spagna, forse in Francia e altrove. E’ ovvio, diranno se “questi non ci proteggono quando c’è una crisi, non ti proteggono dopo, non c’è solidarietà, quando arrivano i migranti ti dicono di tenerli nel tuo Paese e davanti al virus ti dicono di fare da solo…””. Per lui è esclusa, chiarisce, ogni scelta diversa dalla creazione di un fondo che “possa emettere debito comune con una garanzia comune” per finanziare gli Stati membri in base alle loro necessità e “non in base alla dimensione dell’economia”. Una proposta la cui importanza è stata ribadita anche durante l’Ecofin di oggi da Francia, Italia, Spagna e Portogallo.

I Paesi ricchi hanno una “particolare responsabilità” nei modi di affrontare la crisi, argomenta Macron. Saranno loro a determinare se la Ue è solo “mercato” oppure un progetto politico. “Tutti stiamo dando forti garanzie alle imprese, ma Grecia, Spagna e Italiaoggi possono dare gli stessi aiuti di Stato che danno Germania e Olanda? No”. E dopo l’emergenza queste disparità peseranno ancora di più: “Ci vorrà un piano di ripresa coerente dal punto di vista ecologico e sanitario e questo non può essere lasciato al livello nazionale. Angela Merkel e Mark Rutte tengono molto alla nozione di azzardo morale, al fatto che alcuni Paesi hanno fatto sforzi e non possiamo trattarli come gli altri…ma io non sto dicendo di cancellare i debiti del passato, solo che oggi dobbiamo avere un obiettivo comune”.
“Per me la Ue è un progetto politico”, conclude, “abbiamo bisogno di trasferimenti finanziari e solidarietà, solo così l’Europa regge”. Il “fattore umano è la priorità e ci sono nozioni di solidarietà che entrano in gioco, le economie devono essere conseguenti. E non dimentichiamo che l’economia è una scienza morale”

Not every person who gets the virus is going to die from it. Many people with severe cases will survive if they are able to get medical care. When the caseload exceeds available resources is when the fatality rate climbs.

Every interaction has a probability of passing the virus. Someone traveling to their cabin is likely to need to stop, get gas, get supplies and interact with people along the way.

4/16/2020

A Chicago hospital treating severe Covid-19 patients with Gilead Sciences’ antiviral medicine remdesivir in a closely watched clinical trial is seeing rapid recoveries in fever and respiratory symptoms, with nearly all patients discharged in less than a week, STAT has learned.

Remdesivir was one of the first medicines identified as having the potential to impact SARS-CoV-2, the novel coronavirus that causes Covid-19, in lab tests. The entire world has been waiting for results from Gilead’s clinical trials, and positive results would likely lead to fast approvals by the Food and Drug Administration and other regulatory agencies. If safe and effective, it could become the first approved treatment against the disease.

The University of Chicago Medicine recruited 125 people with Covid-19 into Gilead’s two Phase 3 clinical trials. Of those people, 113 had severe disease. All the patients have been treated with daily infusions of remdesivir.

> Your're likely to get the coronavirus.

> Most cases are not life-threatening, which is also what makes the virus a historic challenge to contain. 

Which sounds entirely reasonable. And the second and actually serious problem is of course, that without a timeline it is not clear what is or is not reasonable. The thing is, in early January, it was very reasonable to assume that the now pandemic would stay an intellectual curiosity, while at the end of January it looked a lot like SARS, that is significant but at the matter of fact a lot less interesting than the annual flu. 

Asking journalists to predict correctly a pandemic, when in the last fifty or so years nothing like that happened is just asking them to act like prophets, which is of course entirely unreasonable. 

Apart from that, the format of just screenshotting headlines should die. Thing is, we don't see the contect they were written at, and most importantly, we can't know wether the article is good or not. Headlines are always clickbait, they are simply not there to inform but to advertise the article. As an example, the National Interest article (the one I can't easily link to thanks to the format, second from right, second from the bottom) may be an entirely reasonable article about the Spanish flu, where the editor just shoehorned in something that is now noteworthy (or as a matter of fact, it may be that the coronavirus in the title is referring to some other virus, since we don't know the publication date, we don't know the context.)"

The reason is because people ""browse"" these sections of the store putting retail workers and other customers at risk and they aren't necessities. This caused a huge uproar by some people in our state, some who suddenly fancied themselves gardeners and started screaming about ""MUH RIGHTS!"". These idiots clearly have never gardened a day in their lives or they would know that the last frost date in Michigan is May 22nd (or later for our northern neighbors). Also, Mother Nature got in on the joke and it has snowed 4 or 5 times here since the governor closed the garden centers, because Mother Nature clearly has a sense of humor. So, with the idiots riled up, some deep pocketed conservative groups decided to take advantage of the situation and organized this protest, keeping people socially distanced, of course (hence, why they are in their vehicles), because they don't actually want their base to die from the disease they're claiming is a hoax. A large majority of the attendees are self-employed tradesman, e.g. handyman, landscapers, painters. They are screaming that the stay-at-home order is unconstitutional and that it needs to be lifted because it violates their right to make a living and ""the DemoncRAT WOOOOMAN governor needs to step down, be jailed, hung, shot, etc, etc,"" because ""they KNOW their RIGHTS and she is VIOLATING them"". What they don't seem to understand and/or aren't prepared for is that even after the order is lifted business will not likely return to normal. Not for a long time and maybe never, because the majority of the population agree with the order and will likely continue to self-quarantine after it's lifted. So, while I understand their desire to ""get back to work!"", it probably won't happen for many of them for a long time to come. I had to shutter my cleaning business during the last recession. I understand their concerns and the fear, but I also know that in the intervening 9 years since I closed my business, I had to go back to school and get a degree in a line of work that is pretty much recession-proof and unlikely to be outsourced anytime soon (never say never, but it is a field that is in high demand right now - IT and cybersecurity).

>March 27, 2020

>HONG KONG — One man made fake Honeywell N95 respirators at a makeshift factory on a farm. Pharmacies sold ineffective knockoffs of a Chinese version of Clorox. In one Chinese province, authorities seized more than seven million masks that were substandard, mislabeled or counterfeited.

>China’s vast manufacturing machine has moved into overdrive to supply the country and the world with masks, testing kits, respirators and other gear to fight the global coronavirus pandemic. Companies big and small that once manufactured other items are now in the business of making anti-coronavirus gear — and regulators in China are struggling to enforce standards while encouraging the flow.

>Those tensions blew into the open internationally this week. Officials in Spain said testing kits it bought from a Chinese company had only a 30 percent accuracy rate, rather than the 80 percent rate they had expected.

>The Chinese embassy in Spain said in a series of tweets that the company that made the test kits, Shenzhen Bioeasy Biotechnology, had not been on Beijing’s list of certified providers nor a supplier to aid packages organized by Chinese companies like Alibaba, the e-commerce giant. Market regulators in Shenzhen, the southern Chinese city where the company is based, said they were investigating the matter.

>Spanish health officials said they bought the tests from an unnamed third-party distributor but argued that they did not need to wait for a certified list from China, saying they had already received European certification. “Spain follows the norm of the European Union,” the health ministry said.

>Still, the news was unwelcome for Spaniards who have waited for several days for their government’s promised rollout of hundreds of thousands of tests to help track the spread of the virus. The spat came a day after the Spanish government announced a $475 million order for emergency medical equipment from China.

>In a statement on social media, Bioeasy said that Spanish officials did not understand how to conduct the test and that it made videos and issued instructions to help them.

>As it has in other industries, from cars to electronics, China has become essential to the medical supply business and has challenged outdated notions that it primarily makes cheap, shoddy goods. Even before the coronavirus struck it made roughly half the world’s protective masks and has become a major force in the manufacturing of day-to-day medical gear.

>It expanded its capacity significantly after the coronavirus first emerged in the city of Wuhan, as factories retooled or expanded and new companies sprang up. BYD, a company that normally makes electric cars, says it could make five million masks and 300,000 bottles of disinfectants a day. Foxconn, a Taiwanese company that typically makes gadgets like iPhones on behalf of Apple and other companies in giant Chinese factories, churned out 10 million masks for its own employees in February and said it was close to making two million a day.


>With its own outbreak seemingly tamed for now, China has looked to sell or donate masks and other gear, in part to improve its public image after it tried, disastrously, to play down its coronavirus crisis in January. Chinese-made masks have been part of aid packages to Europe, to developing countries and to the United States. In a tweet on Thursday, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo of New York thanked Huawei, the Chinese telecommunications company that has been mostly banned from doing business in the United States over Washington’s security concerns, for donations of masks and other protective gear.

>But even as it encourages production, the Chinese government has also had to step up enforcement efforts to stop defective and uncertified products. That presents a challenge to Chinese officials, who have to ensure quality standards are met even as they push factories to make what the world needs.

>The problem isn’t confined to China. In the United States, an initial coronavirus test kit rolled out by government officials contained a faulty indicator. But the sheer size of China’s response and the lingering effects of its own coronavirus containment efforts have complicated the process.

>“Every time when something major happens in society like this virus outbreak, there is a lot of demand and different kinds of companies try to get in,” said Cody Zhang, the chief executive officer of a start-up seeking certification for its own products, including a disinfecting robot. “It becomes hard at the beginning to figure out which ones are good and which ones are bad.”


>Regulators have shut down tens of thousands of shops making fake masks, faulty thermal temperature guns and disinfectants that don’t work, according to government disclosures.  Thousands of companies and individuals have been punished for offenses like making counterfeits or price gouging, according to China’s State Administration for Market Regulation, which oversees standards and testing.

>Earlier this month, Chinese regulators vowed to step up cooperation with local law enforcement to stamp out counterfeits and shoddy goods. “In our next steps, we will continue to take solid action toward a ‘severe punishment and no amnesty’ approach,” said Chen Zhijiang, an official with the market regulation agency. The agency did not respond to a request for comment.

>Police have been sent out to raid the operations of counterfeiters across China. In the city of Chongqing, some 88,500 officers filed hundreds of cases. Many of those were related to poor quality protective gear. Others included the manufacturing of counterfeit drugs and medical devices.

>At the same time, local officials have worked to streamline the certification process to bring new capacity and new devices online.

>Mr. Zhang, whose robot start-up in Shenzhen is called YouIbot, and his engineers built an antivirus robot over a frenzied two weeks. As it rolls along the floor, six ultraviolet light bars sanitize the surface, and its infrared camera can scan patients and other people in public for fevers.

>Shenzhen officials jumped in to help get the robot certified, Mr. Zhang said. Companies making “epidemic prevention” products are placed in a priority line for regulatory approval. In mid-March, a senior city official made a high-profile visit to the offices of YouIbot and other start-ups with ambitions to make outbreak-related products, and spoke to city cleaners in a media campaign to emphasize how the city is getting back to work.

>The effort helped shorten YouIBot’s ability to deliver a robot to one month from three for the subway system in the adjacent city of Guangzhou, said Keyman Guan, YouIbot’s marketing director.

>“It happened in just a blink,” Mr. Guan said.

>Companies looking to get into outbreak prevention can readily find money. Starting up can prove to be harder.

>In Hong Kong, a semiautonomous Chinese city, long lines formed outside pharmacies as desperate residents sought masks. Seeing an opportunity, Tong Ka-fai, a filmmaker and former child actor, raised money from his production company’s investors and from his film editor to buy a mask-making machine in Chennai, India. In interviews, he said he had enough raw material to make 10 million masks in two or three months.

>“I am not the first to see this market. I may even be one of the last ones,” he said in an interview in February. “But I took action right away.”

>Mask Factory, his new mask-making company, offered a subscription plan that promised to send customers a box of masks every month.

>“I wanted to avoid the desperate feeling of hunting for masks every time I ran out,” said Scarlett Chan, a secondary school teacher, who subscribed. “The plan promised one box every month. It sounded too good.”

>Then some customers requested refunds after local media reported that its masks had failed testing standards and that the company had been kicked out by its landlord. On Thursday, two of its masks passed a second set of tests. It also said it had chosen to move from its old location.

>“I feel really stupid,” Ms. Chan said. “I wanted to support a local venture but am now one of the people who fell into a trap.”

>Mr. Tong said the company had been hacked, snarling its operations, but that refund requests had been processed and new products would be shipped.

>“Our haters and competitors keep exaggerating what we haven’t done well,” he said, “but our supporters really believe in us.”"

>*“It seems like the computer models for the corona virus pandemic are about as accurate as the computer models that have failed so miserably on global warming,” tweeted Patrick Moore, the chairman of the CO2 Coalition, which claims the world needs to burn more fossil fuels to help the planet and has connections to the Trump White House. “Proves you can’t predict a chaotic, multi-factor, non-linear future.”*

>*Others predicted blowback if the coronavirus pandemic isn’t incredibly deadly.
“I cannot even begin to describe the public backlash that will occur if #Corinavirus [sic] kills fewer Americans this year than the flu,” wrote Dinesh D’Souza, the conservative author who was pardoned by Trump after a felony conviction of making illegal campaign contributions. “For starters, the medical establishment will look like even bigger fools than the #ClimateChange establishment.”*


The good parts:

>*“Models are absolutely fundamental to doing any kind of science, and so people that rag on models without being specific about what it is they are even talking about are just really betraying that they don’t understand how science works,” said climate scientist Gavin Schmidt, an author of that paper and the director of the NASA Goddard Institute for Space Studies.
Nonetheless, conservative pundits, who are not trained as climate scientists, have repurposed the coronavirus modeling to attack climate projections in recent days.*

>*Dr. Anthony Fauci, the immunologist who helps lead President Trump’s coronavirus response team, has repeatedly explained why the models have shifting numbers.

First of all: **this is not your failure as a person**

These are circumstances beyond your control and no-one saw it coming. No-one planned for this, not even the government. This is a terrible time for a lot of people and not everyone is getting in to the right help schemes unfortunately. But there are options and places you can go. You will need to do some of the legwork here.

But let me try and outline some ways you can get help, and maybe others will chip in too:

**Food**: it sounds like it's time to go to a food bank. Find one [here](https://www.trusselltrust.org/get-help/find-a-foodbank/). They may be able to provide nappies too. I appreciate it's not easy to swallow your pride and ask for food help, but it's better than not eating. 

**Phone**: You can get a prepay sim from [giffgaff](https://www.giffgaff.com/) next day that would let you receive calls and make 0800 calls, and even making calls to 020 numbers or 0300 numbers shouldn't be too expensive. Have you tried contacting your phone company and explaining why you can't pay this month? They are being pretty understanding at the moment.

**Electric**: call them or get them in a webchat (may be a long wait time). Explain your situation. They may offer a payment holiday. They are also offering support arrangements for people on prepayment meters even if you're not on a monthly plan.

**Job**: why were you laid off? Was it due to coronavirus? Is there a chance your employer might agree to furlough you instead now this scheme is available? It might be possible to get back on the payroll and get this extra support if needs be.

Do you think the above could help? Let me know and we can make the advice more specific if these initial suggestions won't work for you."

Q: So what fraction of cases never show symptoms, do  we know? 

Drosten: Probably a small fraction, I think. Pre symptomatic and asymptomatic is widely confused. Asymptomatic… Well I mean in the Munich cohort for instance that was in the end no asymptomatic transmission because if you're really went back and spoke to the people, they would remember some 2 or 3 days of some sort throat but they didn't take it seriously. **And now all of this talk about let's say silent zero conversions, I don't know, we are not seeing this and especially now I mean this is not the time to detect silence zero prevalence, right? The epidemic hasn't even begun. At the same time we're just moving out of the common cold season so there is all the those cases that have residual IgM from their recent human coronavirus infections and this will cause cross reactivity with ELISA tests actually the IgM positive cases so the predictive value will of course increase as we move into may June July but now I don't know, all of these ELISA studies that are now starting if they show something like 3-4& over the the known PCR based background in the population this is probably contributed by false reactivity and only later on can ELISA test really identify something like a I don't know a population background. But then, also these cases this doesn't mean they are asymptomatic it just means they haven't been diagnosed when they were infected.**

https://www.microbe.tv/twiv/twiv-601/


There's a LOT of junk science going on re: antibody tests right now. It's frankly rather distubring. I don't trust claims made by any self-interested parties that the tests are specific enough at this point in time. Maybe soon they will be but for now, not a chance. See also: 

https://covid19-insights.squarespace.com/blog/covid19-insights-9

It's long so I will cut and paste the relavent section here: 

Whether or not you understand the technical details of how they work, there are three things to know about rapid IgM/IgG tests:

(a) they will be absolutely critical for public health officials, modelers, and policy makers to understand how the Covid-19 coronavirus spreads;

(b) they could have one of several roles in widespread testing among the general public, none of which are clear right now; and

(c) they will create a lot of media attention and general confusion in the next few months.

If that’s not enough, at last count, roughly 60 versions of a rapid antibody test for IgG or IgM were queued up for emergency approval by the US FDA and/or the WHO, each one of which will perform differently and needs to be validated.

Again, like their distant cousin the rapid antigen test, the beauty of the rapid IgM/IgG test for Covid-19 is their simplicity and speed--simple to operate from a drop of blood, 15 minutes to a result--almost exactly like pregnancy tests. The problem is in their performance, and trying to interpret what a positive or negative result means.

There are three basic problems:

1. Cross-reactivity

We discussed this in Insight #8 on immunity. Any IgM/IgG test might demonstrate cross-reactivity to other coronaviruses. This won’t be a major problem with MERS and SARS, since so few people ever contracted those coronaviruses. However, the best studies done in the 1990s - 2000s (in the US and Europe) suggest that 75-99% of all humans have antibodies to one or more of the common-cold causing coronaviruses. The question is, will the diagnostic tests developed in 2020 inadvertently detect those antibodies--and claim someone is immune to Covid-19, when in fact they only have evidence for immunity to a common cold virus?

Companies will have to do careful studies on children and adults to be sure they are not picking up antibodies that developed after exposure to common cold coronaviruses.

2. False positives, false negatives (and an issue well known in medicine, Bayes’ theorem)

Even though >60 versions of IgM/IgG antibody tests for Covid-19 have been developed, and some perform better than others, a “false positive” problem plagues most tests for IgM/IgG that are in the rapid test format shown in the photo above.

Every test developer must show to the US FDA and/or WHO an assessment of test performance in real people. Here is one example: from the only IgM/IgG test to have received an Emergency Use Authorization from the US FDA as of 10 April 2020:
image7.jpg

Attribution

Without going into the technical details, the two concerns this table reveal are:

    Only 93.8% of people infected with the Covid-19 coronavirus have a positive result with this company’s test--which in theory could mean that 6% of people never develop IgM/IgG responses, or that the test was performed too early in an infection, or that the rapid test format is not as good at detecting IgM/IgG as a laboratory test, even when it is there (in fact, it’s the latter--as we saw in the figure above showing that 100% of patients develop IgM/IgG by ~30 days, the failure to detect it is largely a shortcoming of the rapid test format).

    More concerning, 4% of people who were not infected with the Covid-19 coronavirus will have a positive test result-- a “false positive,” as it turns out.

The false positive problem is not an indictment of the test or the test developer--4% is not bad, as far as rapid IgM/IgG tests go, it is just the nature of the test. In some situations, you can live with a false positive result--pregnancy testing may not be the best example given the emotions a false positive pregnancy test might provoke, but eventually, the fact that the test was falsely positive will declare itself. With Covid-19, a false positive test result will mean that someone will believe they are immune to the Covid-19 coronavirus, when in fact they are not, and they will have very little way of finding out that the test was wrong--other than by contracting the virus at a later date.

And, without going into the details, Bayes’ theorem is a statement about how false positives are especially problematic when the thing you are looking for with your diagnostic test is uncommon--which immunity to Covid-19 will be throughout 2020. By most estimations, the net result will be that in all likelihood, in 2020, something like 7 of every 10 positive IgM/IgG tests for Covid-19 might be a false positive. That’s a problem.

To be clear, every rapid Covid-19 IgM/IgG test in the queue at FDA and WHO will demonstrate data very much like the table above--90-98% correct at identifying people with IgM/IgG in their blood, and 2-5% false positives

3. Validation

Lastly, without going into any detail, every test in development will have to gather the data to prepare a table like the one above--a few hundred samples from known Covid-19 patients, and a few hundred samples from healthy patients. That may sound straightforward, but we learned from Ebola that it can be extremely difficult for test developers to get access to samples they need to run these studies."

>Attached to the email was the letter Crozier wrote pleading for help with a coronavirus outbreak aboard the Roosevelt. The letter has now been widely reported, but the email it was attached to had not been released before the Post's report.

>In the email, Crozier called the recipients ""incredible leaders"" who he would ""gladly ... follow into battle whenever need.""

>""I fully realize that I bear responsibility for not demanding more decisive action the moment we pulled in, but at this point my only priority is the continued well-being of the crew and embarked staff,"" Crozier wrote. ""As you know, the accountability of a commanding officer is absolute, and I believe if there is ever a time to ask for help it is now regardless of the impact on my career.""

>The email was addressed to Rear Adm. Stuart Baker, commander of the Roosevelt's carrier strike group; Adm. John Aquilino, commander of U.S. Pacific Fleet; and Vice Adm. DeWolfe Miller, commander of Naval Air Forces. Seven other captains were copied on the email.

>An unnamed senior defense official told the Post that Crozier could have sent what's known as a ""personal for"" message to senior service leaders that would have flagged the issue as sensitive and important without looping in as many people.

>Crozier was fired after the attached memo - which warned that ""sailors do not have to die"" - leaked to the press.

>At a news conference announcing Crozier's firing, Modly cited the number of people the email was sent to as one of the reasons he lost confidence in Crozier's ability to command the ship.

>""It was copied to 20 or 30 other people,"" Modly said then. ""That's just not acceptable. He did not take care and what that did is it created a little bit of a panic on the ship.""

>Modly later resigned after traveling to Guam to give a speech aboard the Roosevelt where he called Crozier ""stupid"" or ""naive.""

>Vice Chief of Naval Operations Adm. Robert Burke conducted an investigation into the situation on the Roosevelt. The results are being reviewed by Chief of Naval Operations Adm. Michael Gilday and are expected to be released as soon as this week.

(Edit: another big problem.  People who give blood are more likely to be medical workers,  due to much higher awareness of the importance.  Medical workers also have more exposure to coronavirus than the general public, so they aren’t representative of the spread in the population, which the article mentions:

When you get COVID19, your immune system recognises the virus and starts an immune response to it. It will produce antibodies that bind to the virus and block it from multiplying. It takes the body 5=7 days to produce antibodies that are specific for coronavirus which is why people are sick for around 5-7 days. The body hasn't produced anything to fight the virus. So when you psychologist tests herself every night. It tells her if she had Coronavirus a week ago. If she wants to know if she caught coronavirus today, she will have to wait over a week for one of her tests to come up positive. 

The hospital labs check for genetic material of the virus using PCR. This will tell whether you have the virus right now. 

The serological tests will be used to tell how many people in society have had the virus at some point and have built up immunity against it. This will be used to safely come out of lockdown."

>LaPlace, Louisiana (CNN)St. John the Baptist Parish is a swampy, rural swath of Louisiana that straddles the Mississippi River. It's an unassuming place with one Walmart, a population of about 43,000, and local eateries like BRS Seafood, which had a line out the door on Easter weekend for crawfish. People stood six feet apart.

>It also sits among a sprawling collection of chemical plants and oil refineries that snake along the river between Baton Rouge and New Orleans. Because of the air pollution, environmental activists have dubbed St. John and its neighboring river parishes as ""Cancer Alley.""

>And now, the parish is known for something else: the highest death rate per capita for coronavirus in the country, according to analysis by The New York Times. It surpasses even some of the most densely populated urban hotspots that are also being crushed by the deadly virus.

>A debate rages over whether there's a correlation between the petrochemical pollution and the coronavirus, which particularly strikes those with weaker immune systems. Regardless, the death toll here in recent weeks is striking by all accounts.

>""It feels like what we went through with Katrina,"" said Geri Broussard, owner of the Baloney Funeral Home in LaPlace, Louisiana -- the main town in the parish. ""It fills every space in your life, like the sky is falling.""

>Broussard said the funeral home is not technically overwhelmed yet but it's seeing twice the intake it normally would in a month.

>According to data from the Louisiana Department of Health, 569 people have tested positive for the virus as of Wednesday, and 47 people have died. That includes 16 residents at one facility, the Southeast Louisiana War Veterans Home in Reserve, Louisiana.

>The numbers are ""tremendous"" for a parish this size, said Dr. Christy Montegut, the parish coroner. ""This virus is just overwhelming people,"" he added. Montegut has worked at the coroner's office for 32 years and has run a primary care practice in town for nearly 40 years. ""It's just been a real surge, like an onslaught.""

>Montegut said the vast majority of people who died from coronavirus also had underlying health issues like hypertension, diabetes, kidney disease, and obesity. So far, he said in an interview last week, he had only seen a couple of coronavirus victims who also had cancer.

>Still, activists who've been long frustrated by the air pollution here argue the correlation to a high coronavirus death rate couldn't be clearer. They point to a recent nationwide study by Harvard that found a small increase in long-term exposure leads to a large increase in the coronavirus death rate.

>""We are suffering at this great percentage because ...(of) the battle we have been in for years in our systems,"" said Robert Taylor, Jr., who leads the group called Concerned Citizens of St. John, which has been targeting a chemical plant in LaPlace, formerly owned by DuPont for decades and now owned by Denka.

>Taylor led a socially-distant protest on Saturday outside a parish government building. Wearing masks and gloves, speakers at the protest wiped down a megaphone in between turns. ""We are dying at unprecedented numbers right here in St. John,"" Taylor said to the crowd of mostly African Americans, which represent the majority here. The group prayed with their gloved hands outstretched and then marched around the parking lot, singing.

>""If you're breathing in these chemicals every single day it automatically affects your immune system. COVID attacks mostly people with low immune systems. Those are the people that are dying,"" said George Handy, Sr., a member of Concerned Citizens of St. John.

>The Environmental Protection Agency released a report in 2015 that drew attention to the parish after finding higher than expected levels of chloroprene in LaPlace. Chloroprene is a chemical classified by the EPA as a likely carcinogen in humans. The agency says the chemical in St. John could potentially be of concern, but it's still doing more monitoring in the area.

>According to the State of Louisiana, Denka committed $17 million to reduce emissions by 85% by the end of 2017. Denka is the second largest employer in St. John.

>""Denka Performance Elastomer's operations do not have any impact on health outcomes or COVID-19 sensitivity,"" said Jim Harris, spokesperson for Denka. ""In this critical time, it is important to look to our state and federal health officials for guidance. Health data suggests illnesses including diabetes, hypertension and obesity to be linked to COVID-19 mortality. DPE's operations are in no way related to these illnesses and health data show no negative health impacts resulting from DPE's operations.""

>Susan Hassig, an epidemiologist at Tulane University, has been studying the coronavirus data coming out of St. John and other river parishes.

>""It certainly gave me pause, because it was so high. And then I looked at all the parishes near it, and they were also elevated,"" she said. ""In epidemiology, we call that an ecologic correlation. So it's a big factor that connects and fits a pattern. But unless we can make the connection at the individual level, it's not something that we can really act upon.""

>Hassig said it's worth studying whether air pollution in St. John makes people more susceptible to coronavirus, but she noted other factors must also be taken into consideration, like smoking behavior and underlying health conditions related to other behavior.

>Others argue that testing was limited in St. John early on and residents were not complying well with social distancing measures -- so much so that the sheriff had to impose a 9 p.m. curfew starting April 1.

>

>Broussard, the funeral home director, described St. John as an incredibly tight-knit community where social gatherings are inherit and where ""everybody knows everybody.""

>""It took a minute for it to set in,"" she observed. ""You had gatherings where people had cookouts and things. I think people are finally getting the message.""

>Health care facilities are also scant in the parish, and the parish resides in a state well known for its poor health ratings. According to the United Health Foundation, Louisiana ranks 49th in the country in terms of overall health.

>Antoine Jasmine, a pastor and traveling speaker based in LaPlace, said some people in the community initially brushed it off as something that would come and go, much like the hurricanes and floods so familiar in this part of the country.

>""Then eventually it shot up like a rocket. People started dropping dead. Three peopled turned into 10,"" he said, sitting in his church where he's been preaching in recent weeks on a livestream to an empty room. ""That's when I believe the fear of what's really going on shocked.""

>Jasmine lost both of his parents to coronavirus on Good Friday; they died within two hours of each other. Jasmine said his family started to socially distance early on, soon after his parents grew ill in mid-March. The last time he saw them, he said, was at a church service in their usual front row seats.

>Jasmine listed a range of factors that could be contributing to the high death rate in St. John, including the air pollution, but he conceded he may never know the real reasons.

>""It will linger why,"" he said. ""But I think the consolation that will be safe for me would be not to fully go into those theories, but just hold onto the strength of what I built with my parents -- and the life they lived.""

That scenario, code-named “Crimson Contagion” and imagining an influenza pandemic, was simulated by the Trump administration’s Department of Health and Human Services in a series of exercises that ran from last January to August.

Yes you’re right but that’s because the flu is familiar and we can prepare for it every year. This is a new disease and not much is known about it.

“You are going to call your own shots,” Trump said, according to a person familiar with the conversation. “I’ve gotten to know almost all of you, most of you I’ve known and some very well. You are all very capable people, I think in all cases, very capable people. And you’re going to be calling your shots.”

Even as business leaders, lawmakers and governors warn persistent testing shortfalls could hamper any effort to reopen the country, Trump is pushing ahead with attempts to revive an economy moribund by the coronavirus pandemic.


The guidelines, meant to speed Trump’s goal of restarting the country, won’t be mandatory. Many governors have already extended restrictions into May or banded into regional collectives that will determine their own reopening plans. The newest consortium was created in the Midwest on Thursday by Democratic and Republican governors.

But Trump, eager to see a return to normalcy for housebound Americans, wants to provide at least a framework for how places can reopen despite warnings from all corners that testing capacity for coronavirus is still too small.

In a document provided to all 50 US governors during an afternoon phone call and obtained by CNN, the White House spelled out a three-phase approach to easing restrictions that depends on meeting specific case count and hospital capacity thresholds.

The benchmarks for the first phase include a sustained decrease in cases over a 14-day period and a return to pre-crisis conditions in hospitals, according to the document.

States should have the “ability to quickly set up safe and efficient screening and testing sites,” the guidelines read, and “quickly and independently supply sufficient Personal Protective Equipment” in hospitals.

The phased approach encourages all individuals to continue good hygiene practices like washing hands and to “strongly consider” using face coverings in public. And the document encourages employers to enact social distancing, temperature checks, testing and sanitation practices in their workplaces.

In the first phase of reopening, the document suggests schools that are currently closed should remain so and employees who are able to telework should keep working from home.

Large venues, including some restaurants, can operate under strict social distancing protocols. Gyms can open as long as they maintain social distancing guidelines, but bars should remain shuttered.

The guidelines still recommend minimizing nonessential travel, and indicate vulnerable populations should remain sheltered-in-place.

Phases two and three gradually decrease the recommended restrictions.

Trump will unveil the guidelines publicly at a 6 p.m. ET news conference. In his call with governors, Trump previewed the plan but insisted it would be up to the individual governors to make the decision in their own states when they begin that process.

Trump said the decision to target May 1 as the day to begin the process of reopening the country came in consultation with Drs. Anthony Fauci and Deborah Birx, medical leaders of the administration’s coronavirus task force.

Trump described the two doctors’ sign-off on May 1 date as a “negotiation.”

“It was a little bit of a negotiation that that’s the way it should be,” Trump said. “I guess, I hope it is that way usually, but we all do want to see things open.”

Ahead of their release, officials said the new recommendations would mimic the social distancing guidelines the President announced in March and extended at the start of April: While not mandatory, they carry the weight of the federal government and the presidency.

Trump, who began the week insisting he had the “absolute authority” to reopen the country, retreated after pushback from Republican and Democratic governors alike. He said each state would submit a plan to him for reopening, though even that is not required.

Many states have already begun drafting plans on returning to normal, including consortia of states on the East and West coasts that have agreed on joint phased reopenings.

Ahead of Trump’s phone call with governors on Thursday, a new collective of Midwestern governors said they were joining together to coordinate on reopening plans. The leaders of Michigan, Ohio, Wisconsin, Minnesota, Illinois, Indiana and Kentucky — both Democrats and Republicans — said they would “work in close coordination to reopen our economies in a way that prioritizes our workers’ health.”

Many of those governors — along with public health experts, lawmakers and business leaders — say that without widespread testing, Americans won’t be able to return to workplaces quickly because it will remain unclear who could still be spreading the virus.

In phone calls with members of the US House and Senate on Thursday, Trump was told by some lawmakers that without increased testing, asymptomatic people may return to workplaces and unknowingly spread further contagion, according to people familiar with the call.

Trump countered by saying his administration had worked to scale up testing and he repeated his dubious claim that the United States had tested more people than any other country.

He also pointed to a new test that people could administer themselves that uses saliva, a person familiar with the conversation said.

It was a similar message to one he received a day earlier during a phone call with some members of his newly formed business advisory council. In that conversation, industry leaders reiterated what public health experts and governors have been telling Trump for weeks: that there would need to be guarantees of ramped-up coronavirus testing before people return to work, according to one person briefed on the discussions.

As they weigh new guidelines on reopening the country, White House officials have pored over data on testing availability and hospital capacity, hoping to more narrowly devise a strategy to improve testing capacity where it still lags.

Trump said Wednesday it was governors’ responsibility to improve testing in their state, shrugging off responsibility for enacting the type of nationwide testing system he was touting only last month.

“We want the states to administer these tests, for the most part,” he said. “We want them to do it, we’re not going to be running a parking lot in Arkansas.”

Birx, the White House coronavirus response coordinator, said there were nine states with fewer than 1,000 cases each who may be the first to lift distancing restrictions. Trump said he believed there could be nearly 30 states in “extremely good shape,” and repeated his assertion that certain places may be able to reopen sooner than May 1.

But even among the nine states with the lowest case counts — Maine, Vermont, West Virginia, Nebraska, North Dakota, Montana, Wyoming, Alaska and Hawaii — not all governors have expressed an eagerness to quickly reopen. Some, such as North Dakota, still appear to be experiencing an increase in cases, meaning their peaks could be weeks away.

The current federal guidelines on social distancing are not expected to be renewed when they expire on April 30. Officials said the White House would work closely with states to ensure reopening efforts are done safely and only when local outbreaks are deemed contained.

In finalizing the new plans, administration officials discussed issuing guidance to states on how to best assess whether they are ready to move away from social distancing, including creating specific thresholds for a reduction in cases and hospital capacity that would trigger a change in status.

Officials have also weighed options on how to reopen workplaces, including scaling up monitoring and recommending temperature checks; increasing the availability of testing, including antibody tests when they become available; new guidelines on how to best socially distance in workplaces, on public transportation and in public spaces like restaurants; and increased availability of masks or other face coverings.

Another idea discussed was recommending people who have recovered from coronavirus or test positive during the antibodies test — meaning they had coronavirus and likely have some form of immunity — go back to work wearing masks.

Officials have also weighed recommendations for schools, child care centers and summer camps, recognizing that returning to work may be difficult for parents if their children don’t also have a place to go.

Before Trump unveiled the new guidelines, he spent the day on phone calls with foreign leaders and lawmakers. In a teleconference with other G7 leaders, Trump faced resistance to his decision to halt US funding to the World Health Organization.

Trump has claimed the WHO is overly weighted toward China and made grave mistakes early in the coronavirus outbreak, a stance he reiterated on the morning videoconference. But other leaders, including German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, sought to bolster the global health body as essential during the pandemic.

“Much of the conversation centered on the lack of transparency and chronic mismanagement of the pandemic by the WHO,” the White House said in a readout of the conversation. “The leaders called for a thorough review and reform process.”"

1) First off you're going to experience and remember being born. That's a pretty traumatic fucking experience, remembering being squeezed out of your mother's vagina. Then you get to remember nursing as you very awkwardly suck on your mother's tit.

2) Even though you have all of your intelligence, you still are in a newborn body. It's not like you can just stand up and start doing jumping jacks. You're still completely helpless from a physical standpoint.

3) The moment you let on that you are this hyper genius child with knowledge of the future, things will never be the same. You'll be studied, you'll be on the local news, you'll be famous for a little while until the news cycle moves on to something else, but you'll be this weird medical enigma. 

4) Any chance of a normal childhood is shot. You won't be able to build any meaningful relationships with other children because you'll be on such a different level than them developmentally. You also will struggle to make friends with adults because while you are on their mental level, it's going to be very awkward being friends with a toddler.

5) You will still legally be under your parent's control, and there is inevitably going to be tension that arises as they order you around because you are their child and you resent that because you still feel like an adult, one who has lived more than they have most likely. This tension is going to make for a very strange and uncomfortable family dynamic. It will be tough on both you and your parents, because they never signed up for this. They just wanted a child.

6) So you finally make it out of those awkward childhood years. You excelled in school (assuming you didn't just blow it all off because you were bored senseless). Now what? You ""know the future"" Well that's good and bad. Lets say the future plays out mostly the same as it did in your life. Well you can predict the stock market and technological trends so you can become absurdly rich. While that sounds good on paper look at most big lotto winners and how happy they are in the long run. Money cannot buy happiness.

7) Speaking of happiness now after that awkward fucked up childhood you get to deal with trying to build relationships with adults. You might think you have such an advantage going in for relationships, after all you've had lots of them already, and you've learned from them. Except your friends and partners won't have those experiences. They will be so naive compared to you. You will get lots of people who want to cling onto you because of your wealth, but most of them won't be true friends.

8) You get to watch all the terrible stuff happen in the world again and there's not much you can do about it. You think you're going to stop 9/11? Good luck. Unless you have used your knowledge to put yourself into a place of power to influence people who make decisions on these things, more likely than not you won't be able to do shit, regardless of knowing what's coming. You'll get to watch the coronavirus outbreak in China and you can scream from the roof tops that we need to act now but you'll be ignored, and have to sit and watch it all go down again, knowing you were powerless to stop it.

So yeah the whole thing seems great on paper, but in reality it would really suck."

The Washington Post runs a story quoting a Chinese official asking for ""empathy"" and slamming the White House for acting ""in disregard of WHO recommendation against travel restrictions.""

Vox tweets: ""Is this going to be a deadly pandemic? No."" The tweet was deleted weeks later.

Canada's health minister Patty Hajdu, who would later say there was no reason to doubt Chinese coronavirus data, says the risk of the virus is ""low"" and that early-warning systems are working ""exactly as they should."" The ""spread of the disease is contained,"" Hajdu claimed.

Death counts indicated that 213 people had died and nearly 10,000 had been infected.

Who was downplaying this again?"

>*Abstract*. New York City’s multitentacled subway system was a major disseminator – if not the principal transmission vehicle – of coronavirus infection during the initial takeoff of the massive epidemic that became evident throughout the city during March 2020. The near shutoff of subway ridership in Manhattan – down by over 90 percent at the end of March – correlates strongly with the substantial increase in the doubling time of new cases in this borough. Maps of subway station turnstile entries, superimposed upon zip code-level maps of reported coronavirus incidence, are strongly consistent with subway-facilitated disease propagation. Local train lines appear to have a higher propensity to transmit infection than express lines. Reciprocal seeding of infection appears to be the best explanation for the emergence of a single hotspot in Midtown West in Manhattan. Bus hubs may have served as secondary transmission routes out to the periphery of the city."

\-Mentioned in the articles above, but the increasing difficulty of visas (and the effect of COVID-19 on the systems of other countries) would decrease international enrollment. I believe 9% of the T14 is international (and a decent percentage in T25 T50 T100)

\-Economy (speculation) has created more aversion to multiple seat deposits. If negotiations are almost over, people (verse other years) would lean toward depositing at one school that they are decently sure they will attend

\-Schools were relatively conservative at the start-middle of the cycle. With the increase in LSAT scores since last year, they sure took their time. This might (speculation) mean more movement in the summer months to make up for gaps in class size

\-Spivey mentioned before in a blog post it might be ""softs"" oriented waitlist cycle. That still might apply but not sure if the medians might have taken the hit from COVID-19.

\-Deferrals are a wild card. Not sure if the # will increase (better to stay at job/avoid Zoom U) or decrease (ride out the economic storm in law school)"

Antibodies form on average over a period of two weeks meaning that the results reflected the presence of infections two weeks prior to sampling. Due to the small number of samples and findings examined, the results must be interpreted with some caution.

""The material used in the study does not represent the population as well as a random sampling of the population, so the result is still very preliminary at this stage. However, it is in line with the results of a previous antibody study conducted on blood donors in Denmark,” says Merit Melin. 

More information on the presence of antibodies in the population and more detailed estimates on the share of people infected with coronavirus will be provided by the random sampling-based population study that THL initiated last week.

If a death certificate is matched to a confirmed COVID-19 case and that record in the MDSS does not indicate a death, the MDSS record is updated to indicate the death and the appropriate local health department is notified.

Covid-19 positive woman spends 30 hours in KEM  parking lot waiting. 



> An old woman Mumbai Mirror reporters stumbled upon in KEM’s parking lot is a classic Covid-19 emergency – she is 66, has a history of heart trouble and is running fever. But forget being given the urgent attention she needed, she was not even attended to and banished to the parking lot. The 30 hours she spent in KEM waiting for a bed included a drive to SevenHills Hospital, where, on arrival, she was told there was no space available.

> She was finally admitted to St George’s Hospital late on Wednesday night.

> And that is not all. Her 36-year-old son, who should have been isolated as soon as the woman tested positive, ended up running around to get her medical attention she so urgently needed.

The reasoning was that when a second strain of HIV with 50% sequence homology was discovered in 1986, they still called the disease AIDS rather than, say, HIVID-86. Having 80% homology to the original SARS coronavirus, they argued that disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 should have been called SARS (and it does, after call, cause severe acute respiratory syndrome). But if the WHO had called it SARS instead of COVID when they named it on February 11th, people would have immediately understood the serverity of the disease and criticized them for the slow response. Thus, they named it COVID in order to deflect criticism. 

Again, this is all conjecture, and the WHO claims that it was just
>following guidelines previously developed with the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) and the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO)

But then why did they wait nearly 2 months after the outbreak started to call it COVID-19 if they already had a nomenclature system in place? I think the alternative theory seems plausible."

The company mentioned in the headline is Panthera Worldwide LLC and was awarded a contract from the Federal Government to deliver N95 Masks. Nearly 8x that the administration would have spent in January or February (avg cost 1.50).  The FEMA contract with Panthera, which was awarded without competitive bidding, has a start date of April 1.

As a comparison, Prestige Ameritech, the largest domestic mask manufacturer, is charging FEMA about 80 cents per mask for the government’s order of 12 million N95 respirators, part of a $9.5 million contract that started April 7.

Panthera is a business of tactical training. One of its owners last year said the company has not had any employees since May 2018. It also has no history of manufacturing or procuring medical equipment.

James V. Pinelli, one of the company’s executives, said he is working his military contacts to obtain the masks.

>We’ve done DoD medical training over the years and through those contacts with that community were brought sources of supply in order to assist in the COVID-19 response,” Punelli said in a text message to The Washington Post, referring to the Defense Department. “We made the connection with FEMA and offered these supplies to them.”

That's actually not true. Think of the *hundreds of thousands* of scientific paper*s* doctors & medicine professors have published about Covid-19 in the past few months so the international medicine community can understand & fight the disease. W**ithout their research, there would be no understanding of what coronavirus does to the body, how to treat it and how not to treat it.** 

When most people think of scientists in this context they think of biochemists working on new drugs. In reality, most of the impactful Scientists involved are actually in medicine itself.

It's their relentless work that informs healthcare workers on what to do, what not to do, and how international healthcare policy/strategy is laid out.

The research that doctors have put out is... Groundbreaking is an understatement.

Healthcare workers are absolutely heroes, but there's a reason why those healthcare workers who can switch focus to research are indeed switching focus on research - more urgent & impactful good will come from it."

That's not their purpose, their expertise or their mission and being overly political would only be a distraction from their work."

The fact that she deleted it after the fact just goes to show that she knows it was the wrong play when she did it but is too much the coward to take responsibility for it.

That doesn’t seem to have any affect on her criticisms of Trump despite him actually having taken action to mitigate the pandemic during her antics.

Im going to save time and write the standard answer for people who never listened to WHO but believe they did nothing becouse of a tweet on the 13th january:

In the press release of 14th january it was stated that there was limited evidence of h2h transmission in family clusters.

This was the first time a hint about h2h transmission was found. But maybe it was not, maybe the family member got infected by touching/eating the same food the original infected person bought at the market.

This means that the statment ""Preliminary investigations conducted by the Chinese authorities have found no clear evidence of human-to-human transmission of the novel #coronavirus (2019-nCoV) identified in #Wuhan, #China￼.""

Its also true.

There was no clear evidence at all.

During 20th and 21st january WHO conducted the first mission on China. And slaped China in the face by stating something China was not informing yet: there was clear evidence of h2h transmission in Wuham.

You can find it here: https://www.who.int/china/news/detail/22-01-2020-field-visit-wuhan-china-jan-2020

Please keep in mind the people who took place in the mission were from everywere in the world, including 2 persons from EEUU (CDC and NIH). So very first prof of this being serious was provided to WHO by CDC and NIH persons from EEUU. On the 21-23rd January.

People who throws shit on WHO need to explain me why WHO shpuld took more seriously than CDC and NIH the facts they found (on a side note: WHO did took it way more seriously than CDCand NIH)

With this information, Tedros called an Emergency comitee on the 23rd for advice on if this outbreak should be called of international relevance.

The comitee didnt reached an agreement. ""The independent members from around the world could not reach a consensus based on the evidence available at the time. They asked to be reconvened within 10 days after receiving more information.""

You can find the members of the comitee here: https://www.who.int/ihr/procedures/novel-coronavirus-2019/ec-22012020-members/en/

You can see there is people from almost everywhere. Including US and Italy.

Tedros didnt waited 10 days and based on the new evidence on the 30th january Tedros called the comitee again that, in this case, agreed to call it a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC).

Also. Before believing again people trowing shit on WHO, you should read all this:

https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/situation-reports

The problem was that vote, but most people are too dumb to see that.

Coronavirus on top was certainly unexpected, but the result of \*any\* kind of disaster on top of Brexit was pretty much predictable.

Fact is that most unemployed-but-fit-to-work British people won't get off their arses to work in a field for legally-mandated minimum wage (which is sufficient for many other professions).  Sure, it's seasonal work, but we've always had people fly from OTHER COUNTRIES, work that seasonal work for that same pay, and then fly back home and be glad of it.

It costs too much to go to work, and you're paid too much to not be in work.  It's a symptom of a poor benefits system that links housing, child, tax, and other benefits into the fact that you got off your arse and decided to work and then instantly affects all your benefits for doing so.  So you choose between free money for rent, your child, all your taxes paid, etc., or having to work for minimum wage and being forced to pay for EVERYTHING yourself immediately.

It's stupid.  But not quite as stupid as jumping out of an entire continent's workforce for an industry that we've always struggled to fill positions in."

https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-china-masks/china-imposes-more-checks-on-mask-exports-to-ensure-quality-control-idUSKCN21S141

The problem is majorly of the world ppe is coming from China, so if india doenst get it dorm them, they have to make there own, and idk why india can't mass produce ppe. With higher quilty checks then that of China,  there can be an argument made that western countries exported there manufacturing go china thaya why they are not capable of making there own. By India didnt. 

That being said, there can be questions made, that China might just be dumping supplies in the global market, so it can be seen to be helping in order to get the ""crono blemish"" off there record. But if they are doing so, they are doing it without much quality control, which is a major problem, considering nearly a 1/3 of crucial supplies is unusable.

> **Summary**

> In response to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, 107 countries had implemented national school closures by March 18, 2020. It is unknown whether school measures are effective in coronavirus outbreaks (eg, due to severe acute respiratory syndrome [SARS], Middle East respiratory syndrome, or COVID-19). We undertook a systematic review by searching three electronic databases to identify what is known about the effectiveness of school closures and other school social distancing practices during coronavirus outbreaks. We included 16 of 616 identified articles. School closures were deployed rapidly across mainland China and Hong Kong for COVID-19. However, there are no data on the relative contribution of school closures to transmission control. Data from the SARS outbreak in mainland China, Hong Kong, and Singapore suggest that school closures did not contribute to the control of the epidemic. Modelling studies of SARS produced conflicting results. ***Recent modelling studies of COVID-19 predict that school closures alone would prevent only 2–4% of deaths, much less than other social distancing interventions.*** Policy makers need to be aware of the equivocal evidence when considering school closures for COVID-19, and that combinations of social distancing measures should be considered. Other less disruptive social distancing interventions in schools require further consideration if restrictive social distancing policies are implemented for long periods.

It's not skeptical, honest or helpful to misrepresent people to win political points. Fox, Dr Oz and the rest don't need people willingly misinterpreting what they're saying to be criticised - and doing so just undermines you and your cause."

* March 6: “I like this stuff. I really get it. People are surprised that I understand it… Every one of these doctors said, ‘How do you know so much about this?' Maybe I have a natural ability. Maybe I should have done that instead of running for president.”

* March 6: “I don't need to have the numbers double because of one ship that wasn't our fault.”

I choose Korean CDC because:

South Korea did not ban air travel from China, allowing for sampling

There is a large Korean diaspora in both China and the US, making the proportion of import cases a representative sample of the local disease prevalence

Korean CDC publishes imported case data including origin, not bucketed into ""travel related"".

The latest imported case data shows very low case imports from China (2%) but high (85%) from US/EU. This proves that the disease in China is contained.

As for how new words gain official signs, different Deaf communities will create different ones. Eventually, one will get used somewhere high profile and that one will be the one that becomes most commonly used. Typically Gallaudet or the NAD will release a video that includes the new sign. If it’s something fairly new or niche, an interpreter will spell first.

> With increasing cases of COVID-19 among migrant workers, this young woman built doctors and nurses a website overnight to help bridge the language gap.

> SINGAPORE: It was midnight on Tuesday (Apr 14) when a sense of dread filled Sudesna Roy Chowdhury as she absorbed the breaking news: A record number of new COVID-19 cases in Singapore, with the vast majority of linked cases coming from foreign worker dormitories.

> The 24-year-old Singaporean could not sleep that night, knowing that even more migrant workers were bound to be needing medical care.

> Advertisement

> Advertisement

> Already in the past week, the recent graduate of the NUS Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine had been volunteering as a Bengali interpreter. If she was not on the phone assisting doctors attending to Bangladeshi patients, she was helping medical facilities to translate sets of instructions into Bengali.

> Her sister, an emergency doctor, would send voice messages of medical terms in Bengali for her colleagues. Even their parents were roped in as more translation requests came in.

> There had to be a faster, easier way to communicate with these patients, Sudesna thought. “I wouldn’t wish for any doctor to say that patient care was compromised because of a communication error.”

> The Chowdhury family helping to do up Bengali translations of medical instructions. (Photo: Sudesna Roy Chowdhury)

> Advertisement

> And the need was urgent: That same evening, it was announced that medical teams would be deployed to all dormitories within the week. Meanwhile, community isolation facilities like the Singapore Expo were also filling up with migrant workers.

> Interpreters and translators would be needed in all these places.

> Among the hospitals, the call for interpreters had gone out earlier. Alexandra Hospital needed help with clinical consultations and remote video calls with migrant worker patients.

> So after consulting with two friends working on the frontlines, Sudesna decided to build a website that would make translations easily accessible to all the medical care teams.

> Never mind that she had zero experience, or that it was 3am. There was no time to lose.

> AN 8-HOUR EFFORT

> Sudesna had two goals for the portal – one, for frontliners to be able to conduct the first consultation with a patient without needing an interpreter; and two, for them to be able to contact an interpreter directly without a middle-man.

> She spent two hours inputting the Bengali translations of relevant phrases and terms used in the emergency department – such as when checking on a patient’s travel history and symptoms – which her sister helped compile.

> The Bengali font was made bigger so that patients would not have to squint. “The website had to be accessible on the phone and very easy to use,” she said.

> An example of the translations done by Sudesna and her family. (Photo: Sudesna Roy Chowdhury)

> By 5am, she was ready to record audio translations, which would come in helpful should the worker be illiterate. “The world is very quiet at 5am, so there was no background noise,” Sudesna said with a laugh.

> Fifty audio files later, each matched to the relevant translation, the website was 90 per cent ready. It was 7am by then.

> Sudesna created a contact list of some 13 volunteer translators she knew – mostly childhood friends – and devised a rostering system. She also decided to add instructions in Bengali on how to monitor one’s own blood pressure and maintain good personal hygiene.

> It was 11am when the site was ready to go. She sent it out to five friends who were doctors, and to her sister’s colleagues in the emergency department. Another sister, who is a paediatrician, also passed the word around.

> SPREAD LIKE WILDFIRE

> Within the next hour, Sudesna had signs that the website was “spreading like wildlife”. A professor wrote to her saying that he had shared it with a group of over 1,600 doctors and all 150 of his batch mates.

> Some friends told her word had spread among the Army Medical Services – which has been assisting with medical care in the dormitories – and some hospitals.

> “It’s a staple now,” one text message read.

> Another email she received said: “Your (website) will save lives… On behalf of Singapore, thank you.”

> Army Medical Services personnel attending to a foreign worker at Westlite Toh Guan Dormitory. (Photo: MINDEF)

> It was all worth the lack of sleep. “I was just so exhilarated that I could finally do more to help,” Sudesna said.

> It was also none too soon. Last night (Apr 16), 654 new cases from worker dormitories were reported.

> 

> Tharun Ragupathi, a house officer at Ng Teng Fong General Hospital, found out about the website through his cohort’s Telegram group. Thus far, he’d been using broken English and sign language to communicate with the migrant workers coming in for COVID-19 testing, most of whom were Bengali speakers.

> “Even when they spoke English, I often got the feeling they were just repeating what I was saying. It can be dangerous because I don’t want to miss anyone who might have COVID-19, or anything in their medical history,” said the 24-year-old.

> Busy as they were with the volume of patients, there was no time to look for interpreters, Tharun added – nor was it “logistically feasible” to ask one to come down to the hospital anyway.

> Now with Sudesna’s website, he can “establish for certain if the patient is low-risk” and save time, he said. “We can also move on from one patient to another quicker, and dedicate more time to more serious cases.”

> A screengrab of the website built by Sudesna.

> More Bengali-speakers have since offered their help as interpreters, and as of Apr 15 Sudesna had 30 in her pool.

> Other language-speakers have also eagerly reached out – and as a result, the website is now being translated into seven other languages, says Sudesna: Namely, Tamil, Hindi, Telugu, Sinhalese, Malayalam, Malay and Mandarin.

> 

> ""This makes me very hopeful for humanity,"" she added.

> COMMUNICATION IS KEY

> There are limitations to the website, though, which Sudesna readily acknowledges.

> For one, medical staff are not always able to access their phones while seeing patients. But she hopes the website still comes in useful for them to learn and practise the terms on their own time.

> Sudesna also hopes that more doctors would call up a volunteer interpreter to assist in follow-up consultations.

> “It gives us the opportunity to ask about (the patient’s) concerns, as they might not share their needs readily with someone who speaks English,” Sudesna said.

> In one instance, a doctor needed to find out why his patient had trouble keeping food down. It turned out that simply providing Bangladeshi food helped, Sudesna said.

> “When my friends heard about this, they were so eager to deliver Bangladeshi food to the patients,” she said. With spirits low among the migrant workers, the little things like food help, she noted. “We cannot underestimate morale at this time.”

> File photo of Muslim foreign workers in Singapore breaking fast during Ramadan.

> With five days to go before Sudesna begins her housemanship at Changi General Hospital, she hopes to beef up her website with as much information as possible.

> For example, she has been on the phone with pharmacists to work out the translations for dosage instructions or common side effects of medication.

> She will also be adding facts about COVID-19 to “fight misinformation”, and mental health resources for the workers.

> Sudesna hopes for anyone who needs Bengali translation to tap on this free resource. “A language barrier can amplify the crisis to a degree that we can’t imagine,” Sudesna said.

> “There is no shortage of help from the Bangladeshi community. Everyone wants to pitch in.”

They don't like the North.  So to elect a defector from North Korea is something that they would want, because the biggest critics of the North Korean regime are the defectors.

President Moon's party (the current administration) has been criticized as being very lax towards North Korea and China.  One of the main criticisms has been his administrations reaction to the coronavirus at the beginning of the outbreak, because he didn't block anybody from China from entering the country.

There's a clear line between the two major parties and their ideas about how to deal with politics in the East Asia region.  It's not surprising that the defector went with the conservative party's side."

> **Background and Objectives:** To date, more than 1,000,000 confirmed cases and 65,000 deaths due to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) have been reported globally. Early data have indicated that older patients are at higher risk of dying from COVID-19 than younger ones, but precise international estimates of the age-breakdown of COVID-19-related deaths are lacking. 

> **Materials and Methods:** We evaluated the distribution of COVID-19-related fatalities by age groups in Europe. On April 6, 2020, we systematically reviewed COVID-19-related mortality data from 32 European countries (European Union/European Economic Area and the United Kingdom). We collated official reports provided by local Public Health or Ministry of Health websites. We included countries if they provided data regarding more than 10 COVID-19-related deaths stratified by age according to pre-specified groups (i.e., < 40, 40-69, ≥ 70 years). We used random-effects meta-analysis to estimate the proportion of age groups among all COVID-19-related fatalities. 

> **Results:** Thirteen European countries were included in the review, for a total of 31,864 COVID-19-related deaths (range: 27-14,381 per country). In the main meta-analysis (including data from Germany, Hungary, Italy, Netherlands, Portugal, Spain, Switzerland; 21,522 COVID-19-related fatalities), **the summary proportions of persons < 40, 40-69, and ≥ 70 years of age among all COVID-19-related deaths were**:

> * < 40 years: 0.1% (0.0-0.2%; I2 24%), 

> * 40-69 years: 12.8% (10.3-15.6%; I2 94%), and 

> * ≥ 70 years: 84.8% (81.3-88.1%; I2 96%). 

> **Conclusions:** People under 40 years of age represent a small fraction of the total number of COVID-19-related deaths in Europe. These results may help health authorities respond to public concerns and guide future physical distancing and mitigation strategies."

Sweden is starting to see some effects of herd immunity in parts of the country, says state epidemiologist Anders Tegnell.

About 50 percent of the population must have developed antibodies before one can talk about a total herd immunity - something he believes comes before a vaccine.

\- We are close to a level where, according to our modelers, we are beginning to see an effect of flock immunity, says the state epidemiologist during today's press conference.

Anders Tegnell says that about 50 percent of the population needs to be immune to reach a status quo, where there are no waves of ups and downs in the number of infected.

\- I think we will reach that level of people getting sick before we get a vaccine, he says.

Since yesterday, Wednesday, another 130 have been reported dead, and a total of 1,333 people have now died in covid-19 in Sweden, according to the Public Health Authority.

The Stockholm region continues to be the hardest hit, with 795 deaths, or 59.6 percent, of Sweden's total coronavirus virus deaths.

Half of all dead in Stockholm on elderly homes

One third of Sweden's deaths have occurred in elderly housing - in Stockholm, that proportion is half.

A majority of those who died in covid-19 in Sweden were people over 80 years old.

\- This is our big problem area, much else seems to work quite well, says state epidemiologist Anders Tegnell about the spread of infection in elderly housing.

During the press conference, Anders Tegnell was asked why the infection protection is so much lower in home health care.

\- The protection of the staff is adapted to the situation in which they work, says Anders Tegnell and continues:

\- We have a work together with the Infectious Disease and the National Board of Health and Welfare and look at how healthcare workers are affected. We look at data about the risks in that group and we have to remember that that group is also in the community. We will see if there may be situations where you may need to strengthen the protection.

Expected increase did not come

However, there are flashes of light in the dark statistics: according to statistics from the Public Health Authority, the expected increase after the Easter weekend has not come.

\- We had expected an upturn after the Easter weekend and we do not see it, says state epidemiologist Anders Tegnell during today's press conference.

Anders Tegnell warns, however, to begin to mute the recommendations on the spread of infection in society.

He calls for continued social distancing: to keep a distance, stay at home if you are ill and that people over 70 should be especially careful.

The curve for deceased is stabilized

The number of deceased per day is starting to stabilize, says the state epidemiologist.

\- We are now at about 60 deceased per day, says Anders Tegnell.

The daily figure deceased is significantly lower than the daily reported figure. In recent days, the reported figure has been well above 100: 114 on Monday, 170 yesterday and 130 today.

The reason for this is a certain backlog - thus a reported death may have occurred several days earlier.

Anders Tegnell is asked to explain why the backlog in the deaths was not corrected.

\- This is crazy fast I would like to say. If you can come to another country in the world that reports their cases faster then I would like to see it."

Siamo poco più di un milione in provincia di Bergamo e i neri sono circa il 9%, ma i ricoverati per Covid a Bergamo sono stati solo l’1,6%. Perché? Forse perché sono più giovani? Giusto. Ma non basta. Non sarà che i neri appena arrivano qua fanno il vaccino per la tubercolosi? La cosa, che sulle prime sembrava senza basi scientifiche, non è poi così campata per aria, al punto che l’Organizzazione mondiale della Sanità ha cominciato a chiedersi se il vaccino per la tubercolosi — BCG come viene chiamato — riduca il rischio di infettarsi con coronavirus e ad avviare studi che lo possano dimostrare.

Hendrick Streeck is one of the world's leading virologists, and he's leading the primary study in Germany that is combing over one of their hotspot regions to study precisely how the virus was able to spread quickly.  His findings so far have been that this virus is  not easily spread by surface contact.  Basically as long as you don't directly cough onto the packaging and then immediately give it to someone, it's very unlikely that a surface will spread the infection.

Lots of people have been freaking out over the initial studies that found trace amounts of the virus on surfaces ""after x days,"" but there is still no hard evidence that anyone has been infected like this.  And it thus far seems unlikely.  

&#x200B;

Just think about it, if it really were that easy for it to spread infection via surfaces, nearly everyone in the entire country has been touching mail and packages on a daily basis, and shopping at grocery stores.  Most people aren't wiping down everything before touching it.  Basically the outbreak would be magnitudes of order worse if we could contract the virus from surfaces that easily.

i think regardless of ur political leaning u should know thru this past few months that the name of the game is $$$. just have $$$ and everything is much more in your favor - even during a pandemic. its opportunity.

* unemployment is sky-high, but market will keep chugging along with each subsequent bad unemployment numbers. 

* avg joe is happy about their 1,200 chump change from stimulus package meanwhile the real steal are the various [tax suspension](https://thehill.com/policy/finance/492802-business-tax-provisions-in-coronavirus-relief-law-spark-controversy) that will make a killing for ppl with $$$. we're talking insane loopholes that will print.

* PPP was funded to 350b out of the 2 tril to help small businesses, but shit tons of ppl are locked out, meanwhile hedge funds applied, public company gets to apply (like [ruth chris](https://www.wsj.com/articles/ruths-chris-steak-house-gets-20-million-from-coronavirus-aid-program-11586895864) getting 20 mil)

* companies can recklessly do crazy buybacks, propping up their stock and when shit hits the fan get bailout cuz its ""not their fault""

if this GILD shit really does turn out to help shit out and curb the dmg, the winners from the coming recession (if there's one) are ones with $$$.

my family is setting money aside for the opportunity to scoop up businesses, properties, etc. like we did in 2009 and up to 2011. i wish i have more $ to toss into things in fact but the last few months have been slow as F for obv reasons.

the system is written by those with $$$. i still consider our family ""upper-middle-class"" cuz we're comfortable enough to rub shoulders with ppl with 40-100 mil+ net worth etc. the political leaning really doesn't matter at that level cuz the system is made for corps and you want to get your ass as close to their level as possible so the laws favors you and your family.

i've met construction/developers seeking funding that are happily voting for POTUS even though they say he's a crazy moron who can't string together a coherent sentence but will toss $ to his campaign cuz their $ will align.

the same goes for say... neighbor that's an MD with private practices/owner of a private clinic group hating on Bernie's medicare 4 all cuz that'll severely fuck with their payout as public option will wreck the gravy train and reduce MD salary etc. (not as much for nonprofit institution MDs but it'll impact those that aren't in procedure/surgeons) so they'll happily make sure Biden gets the nod in lieu to keep the system going.

it's one thing to sling and YOLO FDs for har har. but seriously, build up the nest egg, get a side hustle/business going, toss money into a property or two and let the money make more money for you. the system isn't design for a 9-5 bullshit. you can be comfortable, but if you want more then i honestly don't think that's the way to go cuz you can easily be replaceable by a younger, cheaper you.

It's [basic math](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/03/16/upshot/coronavirus-best-worst-death-toll-scenario.html). The flu has a .1% mortality rate. Coronavirus likely has a mortality rate at least 5-20 times higher than that, anywhere from .5% to 2%.

At those mortality rates, if 50% of the US population contracted the virus, that means the death toll would be anywhere from 832,000 to 3,300,000. The only reason we haven't had hundreds of thousands of deaths already is because *we are all staying home as much as possible.*"

Residential AC's are less efficient, but the reality is they are used on much less square footage since most residential properties don't have long hallways, empty buffer spaces, etc. etc. Commercial real estate usage is really inefficient. More square footage = higher consumption.

An office is cooling that hallway 3 floors up nobody has walked in for hours due to a long meeting and lunch.  Your office is cooled when you're at lunch, in meetings etc. The conference room when there's no meeting. etc. etc. 

Also keep in mind, most residential AC's also stay on during the day just with a higher set point since cooling takes an extremely long time. So it's not like residential power consumption drops substantially because people go to work. It just tapers off a little.

When you're home, you're either using a more efficient full house AC, or a less efficient window AC cooling just the room you're in.  

Power usage would actually be likely to drop if you looked at the overall.  Residential AC units may be more inefficient, but they are cooling relatively efficient spaces especially.

No, saw a GP (via Teleconference) who insisted I get tested since I was from this area.

No, very short and spaced out line of 3 people at Bondi Pavillon clinic. Very well organised setup.

* What was it like to get a swab done?

They give you a mask and then a worker in protective equipment gets your details and does a swab deep into your throat through your nose. It took like 5 seconds to do the swab itself and it was totally painless even though I have horrible allergies so my nose is always inflamed.

Those evicted, mostly Igbo Nigerians, insisted that they had paid their rent, had valid visas and the right paperwork, and had no contact with anybody infected with COVID-19. Meanwhile, many others were forced into a 14-day quarantine and random testing without getting their test results. Tony Mathias, an Ugandan exchange student, told Agence France-Presse: “I’ve been sleeping under the bridge for four days with no food to eat. … I cannot buy food anywhere. No shops or restaurants will serve me.”

Over the past two decades, China and Africa have become inextricably entwined. China has built roads and railways across Africa and is the biggest trading partner for the entire continent. Eighty percent of Nigeria’s bilateral debt is owed to China. About 60 percent of foreign direct investments to Ethiopia came from China in 2019. China has repeatedly stressed the importance of China-Africa alliances based on “mutual prosperity.” Yet these partnerships face irrevocable disruption if the Chinese government continues to downplay deeply rooted racial prejudices and dismisses the international outrage concerning the treatment of African migrant workers and students in China.

The events of April 10 are part of the response to growing Chinese fear of a reemergence of coronavirus infection but also build on long-standing hostility toward Africans in southern China. Anti-African feelings in China go back decades, including riots aimed at Africans in 1988-1989 in Nanjing. In Chinese media, Africans are often characterized as backward or primitive and blackness as unattractive. Virulent racism common on social media is largely unchecked by censors, including claims that Africans are rapists, drug dealers, or AIDS carriers.

Those prejudices have led to a string of incidents amid coronavirus-induced paranoia. On April 4, reports of an infected Nigerian man attacking a Chinese nurse went viral, unleashing a slew of online trolls demanding the cleansing of a city they claimed was “littered with blacks.” Three days later, four Nigerians tested positive for the virus after having been seen eating together at a local restaurant. These reports sparked widespread fear that Africans were the primary cause of recent upticks in coronavirus cases.

African expats were left at the mercy of xenophobic attitudes and heavy-handed enforcement. “They are accusing us of having the virus,” Tobenna Victor, an evicted Nigerian student, told the BBC. A viral post shows McDonald’s staff in a restaurant in Guangzhou holding a sign that says: “We’ve been informed that from now on black people are not allowed to enter the restaurant.” Rumors quickly circulated that “300,000 black people in Guangzhou were setting off a second epidemic,” and even though public officials later debunked that myth, the damage to domestic perceptions in China had been done.

Video evidence of these mistreatments has sparked international outrage. A dozen African countries have summoned their Chinese ambassadors to explain the “inhumane treatment being meted out.” A coalition of African ambassadors in Beijing delivered a letter to China’s foreign minister demanding an immediate end to all discrimination. Moussa Faki Mahamat, the chairman of the African Union Commission, also expressed his “extreme concern.” Moses Kuria, a vocal member of the Kenyan Parliament, took a more aggressive stance, calling for the immediate removal of all Chinese nationals in Kenya.

Rhetoric in the African press was just as intense. The front page of the Daily Nation, Kenya’s biggest newspaper, led with the headline “Kenyans in China: Rescue Us From Hell.” Similar news stories were found in the Nigerian, Ghanaian, and Ugandan press. The hashtag #ChinaMustExplain quickly trended on Twitter, as users expressed their anger and frustration. However, many people on Chinese social media praised the forcible expulsions and mistreatments as responsible steps to “stemming the spread of virus by Africans.”

China’s response has been to deny that any problem exists. Last Thursday, Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian responded by stressing that China treats “all foreign nationals equally.” On Saturday, the Chinese Embassy in Zimbabwe urged critics not to “sensationalize isolated incidents.” The Global Times, a state-controlled English-language newspaper, dismissed the situation in Guangzhou as a “Western trap to stir enmity,” all the while reaffirming China’s impartiality. Yet as more and more videos of African mistreatment emerge, China’s stance of innocence is harder to maintain.

Some measures have been taken. McDonald’s has apologized for the Guangzhou store’s refusal to serve black people, ordering the halt of any discrimination. Chinese volunteers banded together to raise money, connecting African migrants with hotels that accept foreign guests and even offering counseling services. Zhao, the spokesman, also stressed that Chinese citizens should end all racist remarks and that the government will indiscriminately provide accommodations for all foreigners. Yet Zhao did not specifically address allegations of forced evictions, lack of testing results, and other discriminatory actions. As of now, no formal apology has been offered.

Some have argued that the recent mistreatment of Africans is the unfortunate consequence of the fact that many of them are migrants living illegally in China whose murky identity poses risks to the public health during the virus. This technical hurdle factors into local officials’ heavy-handed approach to prevent a second wave of the infection.

The fact that many Africans lack legal status is partially a result of China’s very own stringent immigration policies and the frequent racism.

Yet the fact that many Africans lack legal status is partially a result of China’s very own stringent immigration policies and the frequent racism. Erratic laws and racial profiling make navigating byzantine immigration channels challenging. Local police are incentivized to stigmatize Africans as sanfei (“the three illegals”—illegal entry, illegal stay, and illegal work) regardless of their immigration status. During crackdowns on immigration, Africans are seen as easier targets than Europeans or other Asians. Demonization of Africans in news reports and social media serves to increase incidents of racial prejudice. In March, an invitation by the Chinese Justice Ministry for the public to comment on a proposal that would ease immigration restrictions led to an inundation of racist comments. African migrants were painted as sexual predators, and many Chinese men vowed to defend the honor of Chinese women.

The crisis in Guangzhou only reaffirmed the underlying racism of Chinese society. And while it poses very real challenges to Sino-African relations, no full breaks between China and African nations are on the horizon. Africa is an increasingly important market for China’s private investors, especially in the technology sector. China is also Africa’s top creditor, having lent an estimated $152 billion to nearly 50 African states between 2000 and 2018. Economic realities, compounded with the destabilization caused by COVID-19, demand that Chinese officials assuage African concerns. “Officials on all sides will have to scramble to put this episode behind them in order to focus on more pressing issues, such as containing the virus and Chinese debt relief,” said Eric Olander, the managing editor of the China Africa Project initiative and podcast.

Yet economic and political relationships between governments alone will not help China address this crisis, not when the insults remain so fresh and when many on the Chinese side still refuse to acknowledge the deep-rooted prejudices underlying the crisis. China’s image as a trustworthy and equal partner to Africa is in danger of being seriously tarnished, as the mistreatment and abuse of nationals from Africa risk confirming preconceptions that China is a racist country. If China is intent on being a major player on the world stage, it must not only confront racist tendencies at home but show that the respect it promises to smaller nations can be extended to their citizens."""

>Joe Biden is very famous, but you wouldn’t know it from looking at his YouTube channel.

>Mr. Biden has just 32,000 subscribers on the influential video platform, a pittance compared with some of his rivals in the Democratic primary race and roughly 300,000 fewer than President Trump. The videos that Mr. Biden posts — these days, mostly repurposed campaign ads and TV-style interviews filmed from the makeshift studio in his basement — rarely crack 10,000 views. And the virtual crickets that greet many of his appearances have become a source of worry for some Democrats, who see his sluggish performance online as a bad omen for his electoral chances in November.

>“This video is 2 days old and it’s sitting at 20,000 views,” one commenter wrote under a recent video of Mr. Biden’s. “This is a guy that is supposed to beat Trump?”

>In a normal election year, a former vice president and presumptive Democratic nominee would have no trouble filling an arena. But the coronavirus has forced Mr. Biden to abandon in-person gatherings and adapt to an all-digital campaign strategy — a daunting pivot even in the best of times, but one made even harder by the need to compete for attention amid a pandemic and a once-in-a-generation economic collapse.

>The shift has been clumsy for Mr. Biden, an old-school retail politician who relishes face-to-face interactions. He lacks the social media firepower of Mr. Trump, whose 106 million combined followers on Facebook and Twitter dwarf Mr. Biden’s 6.7 million, and whose White House coronavirus briefings have allowed him to commandeer the news cycle. Mr. Biden’s first virtual town hall last month was marred by technical problems, and some of his other digital experiments — like a soporific campaign podcast, “Here’s the Deal,” which did not rank among the top 100 podcasts on Apple Podcasts as of this week — have not gone as well as hoped.

>Online popularity doesn’t always lead to electoral success. (If it did, New Yorkers would be listening to daily coronavirus briefings from Gov. Cynthia Nixon.) But underestimating the internet’s influence is a mistake, too. In 2016, Mr. Trump’s surging popularity among the internet’s grass roots was a bellwether that indicated his candidacy might be stronger than it appeared in traditional polls. Conversely, Mr. Biden’s lack of support from meme makers and viral-content mavens could signal trouble ahead.

>The problem for Mr. Biden is not that he is old or out of touch. After all, other septuagenarians, including Mr. Trump and Senator Bernie Sanders, have amassed intense and loyal online followings despite not being internet natives. And Mr. Biden was once an internet star himself. (Who can forget “Diamond Joe,” the beer-guzzling, Trans Am-driving satirical character created by The Onion, which launched a million memes during the Obama years and became an indelible, if fictional, part of Mr. Biden’s legacy?)

>The problem is also not that Mr. Biden is ignorant of the internet’s power. His campaign employs a number of veteran digital strategists who have been busy trying to elevate his online profile with “No Malarkey” coffee mugs and feel-good quarantine videos.

>Mr. Biden’s biggest problem is structural. Most of our online political communication takes place on internet platforms that are designed to amplify content that provokes strong emotional reactions, often by reinforcing tribal identities. Mr. Trump’s unfiltered, combative style is a natural fit for the hyperpolarized audiences on Facebook and Twitter, whereas Mr. Biden’s more conciliatory, healer-in-chief approach can render him invisible on platforms where conflict equals clicks.

>Those structural disadvantages hobbled Hillary Clinton’s 2016 social media campaign, which struggled for traction despite big budgets and her name recognition. The Trump campaign also paid lower effective rates for Facebook ads than the Clinton campaign because Facebook’s automated ad-buying system gives more reach to ads that generate lots of engagement.

>Rob Flaherty, the digital director for the Biden campaign, said in an interview that he considered the 2020 election a “battle for the soul of the internet,” which required not just taking shots at Mr. Trump but inspiring people to come together around Mr. Biden.

>“If you want to succeed on the internet without turning into Donald Trump, the best thing you can do is show empathy and compassion, and build community,” Mr. Flaherty said. “Our digital strategy is going to reflect that.”

>YouTube, where progressives have only recently started competing for attention with an extensive network of popular right-wing creators, is particularly thorny territory for a centrist pragmatist like Mr. Biden. The platform’s left-wing commentariat, often referred to as “LeftTube” or “BreadTube,” mostly seems to consist of young Sanders supporters who see Mr. Biden as an establishment phony. Video compilations of Mr. Biden’s verbal gaffes, with titles like “17 Minutes of Joe’s Melting Brain,” have gotten millions of views over all.

>Joe Rogan, a popular talk show host with an enormous YouTube following, endorsed Mr. Sanders this year. After Mr. Sanders withdrew from the race, Mr. Rogan stated that he would prefer to vote for Mr. Trump than Mr. Biden, saying of the former vice president: “The guy can barely remember what he’s talking about while he’s talking.”

>Facebook and Twitter are friendlier turf for Mr. Biden, but he is still lagging far behind Mr. Trump, whose rapid-fire posts routinely make him the most visible figure on each platform. In the last month, Mr. Trump’s posts got 42.6 million interactions on Facebook, including likes, comments and shares, according to CrowdTangle, a Facebook-owned data tool. Mr. Biden’s Facebook posts got just 3.4 million interactions in the same time period.

>Then there is the grass-roots gap. In 2016, Mr. Trump benefited from the support of amateur meme makers on Reddit, Twitter and other platforms who provided his campaign with a steady stream of fresh content. Mr. Biden has no such brain trust, and several popular left-wing content creators told me that inspirational, pro-Biden posts did not perform nearly as well on their pages as generic anti-Trump content.

>Mark Provost, an administrator of The Other 98%, a left-leaning Facebook page with more than six million followers, said Mr. Biden could capitalize on liberals’ hostility for Mr. Trump by giving the party’s base more red meat, and becoming more combative himself.

>“You want to tap into that deep id inside the Democratic Party,” Mr. Provost said. “At this point, people just want to see a bully get smacked down. They want to see him hammer Trump a lot more.”

>In the coming months, Mr. Biden will benefit from his proximity to Democrats with bigger online followings. This week, two videos containing new endorsements of Mr. Biden, from Mr. Sanders and Mr. Obama, got millions of views apiece and briefly stole the spotlight from Mr. Trump and his coronavirus task force. Mr. Biden will also benefit from the efforts of left-wing super PACs like Priorities USA Action, which has raised millions of dollars to rally digital support for the Democratic nominee online.

>These efforts may still seem small in comparison with Mr. Trump, who has spent years building a vast data operation and a war chest that will allow him to blanket the internet with ads. Brad Parscale, who ran Mr. Trump’s digital operation in 2016 and is managing his re-election campaign, has said he does not expect Mr. Biden — or any other Democrat — to catch up to Mr. Trump, with or without social distancing.

>“President Trump’s supporters will run through a brick wall to vote for him,” Mr. Parscale said in a recent statement. “Nobody is running through a brick wall for Joe Biden.”

>For now, Mr. Biden’s supporters can take solace in his relatively strong polling performance, and the hope that a lull in the coronavirus allows him to return to the campaign trail this summer. And while some Democrats are worried that Mr. Biden’s online struggles are a preview of a rough road ahead, others don’t see social media success as a prerequisite for winning the White House.

>“We’re not campaigning for YouTuber in chief. We’re campaigning for president,” said Andrew Bleeker, the president of Bully Pulpit Interactive, a Democratic strategy firm. “He has a message of bringing the country together around the American spirit. He doesn’t need to change that to get views.”"

COVID-19: [Europe’s Response to the Coronavirus: Virtual Update from Sweden's Chief Epidemiologist](https://youtu.be/Wo10IIMHYXk).

Now to your questions.

>As of April 9, Sweden’s rate per capita of confirmed deaths from the coronavirus is higher than the rate of its fellow Scandinavian countries or the US.

Complex conversation. But it seems to be around the following:

* Sweden is attempting to implement an approach to flatten the curve which is sustainable long term with our available circumstances and resources, potentially leading to more cases early on.
* Our elderly and sick population has been hit really hard, why is currently unclear. But early signals indicate that it could be due to bad working practices for workers.
* Confirmed deaths aren't counted the same way across countries.

I don't endorse any of these viewpoints. I'm just presenting them. Personally I find the number of deaths distressing, but I can also appreciate that we won't know the full picture until all is said and done.

>Hospitals are overcrowded and staff members are overworked.

Certainly crowded, and this is a highly stressful environment for Health Care workers regardless of where you are. Resources are pressed but the general message is that we have enough for a couple of days (PPE + Medication) and it's being filled up to meet demand in a continuous process.

At least in Sweden we have decent health care, people are generally supported to stay home if sick (including health care workers), and we recently [implemented an emergency measure](https://www.businessinsider.com/coronavirus-sweden-icu-staff-double-pandemic-crisis-situation-agreement-2020-4) providing certain high risk health care workers with hazard pay.

>\[..\] the military has begun setting up field hospitals in major cities, including Stockholm, the country’s capital and the epicenter of its outbreak.

Yeah, all though they haven't been used yet in any extensive capacity. The fact that the military is helping set them up is more of an aside, they're just another resource available to the country ([video](https://youtu.be/MJPsx7ZF1xQ) in Swedish but subtitles can be translated on YT).

Note that the epicenter seems to be moving from Stockholm now to Södermanland (bordering region).

>are the hospitals truly nearing capacity?

No, we have \~20% more ICU beds in the most affected regions according to today's briefing IIRC. And the number of people admitted are fairly stable.

Entryism is a dead end,as is reformism as a primary goal too. The left participating in electoralism historicaly only made sense with an actual working class party  that puts forth clearly the socialist alternative and uses electoralism as a means for agitprop,grow on membership and to show how useless electoralism actualy is not to push for socialism through electoral victories. Even the electoral victories historicaly only came due to the pressure and existance of the revolutionary left. Either domesticaly or abroad

The objective of building a working class socialist party is it being structualy detatched from electoralism with connections and presence on the community, work, town ,union level agitating and spreading unfiltered socialist messages is not to cause a revolution is to have the structure in place for when a revolutionary situation happens. A crash, a war, a huge scandal, a party imploding,the fucking coronavirus, the constant material conditions reaching a tipping point, electoralism failing the working class again, all of the above. When it comes there should be a working class party organized outside of electoralism (even if it participates in it) and with clear strategy ,structure an connections to take advantage of it ,recruit and channel the revolutionary spirit and struggle toward the right direction. 

The strategy rn of pushing the Democrats left and ""entryism"" in the second most capitslist and anti-socialist party in history is supposedly a viable strategy to increase the visibility of socialist ideas, but it’s not even a very good strategy to do that. 

If you are a socialist in the Democratic Party(hell there arent even any, only socdems) who wants to get anything done (legislation, for example), you are by default required to collaborate with your colleagues, who are representatives, first and foremost, of the capitalist class. Not only will any compromise you reach with these bourgeois representatives favor the capitalist class by default, but a clear working class perspective will be lost. The effect will not be to raise class consciousness in the working class, but to spread the confused message that it is possible and desirable to collaborate politically with enemy class interests and that better working class world through reforms is possible along with compromised actual socialist dog whistles .The Dem party will self implode before allowing a true working class perpective to be channeled through it without a filter(and at that point a new party would be needed lol). Its structured down to its very base to water down socialist policies and absorb revolutionary leftist spirit. And the starting points of the electoral sanders movement isnt even that so its compromised position would mean even less for the class conciousness of the working class


So the left is nothing without the movement of the working class, and the class struggle has ups and downs. Right now, as compared to the last decades, the struggle is on the upswing and a literal majority of the people under the age of 30 in the US view socialism more favorably than capitalism,whatever that means to them, and in raw numbers this accounts for tens of millions of people. The thing that we are missing in the US is an unapologetically socialist alternative. Polls show that a majority of Americans and the overwhelming majority of young Americans are dissatisfied with both parties of the capitalist class. Putting all the eggs into reforming one into a platform for socialist ideas is a losing battle. We need a working class political party with a socialist program for this layer to gravitate towards. It wouldn’t win an outright electoral victory, but it would be a massive step forward for the US working class and an opportunity to actually put forward socialist ideas, and not compromised watered down half-steps, to the masses through parties that hate them


This project could start today, and it would only be a matter of the DSA and other leftist orgs and media changing their organizational priorities towards building such a party. . This process would obviously take time, but it’s not like reforming the Democratic Party is an immediate fix, or even something that could be accomplished in the foreseeable future. Would it win the election under this party? No. And more importantly, is winning an election, and governing the state in a certain way, really the path to socialism? I would argue that a socialist party with 500,000 members would be a much more significant step forward than any push of the Dems to the left and any class conciousness that you can raise through them."

In Pa., Wolf’s similar orders, which went into effect in mid-March, is set to last until at least April 30, and that continues to be the deadline date for now.

“I don’t have any plans along those lines yet, and again, that’s New York and he has to make decisions about what’s best for New York,” Wolf said during a conference call with reporters.

“I will continue to look at what I think is best for Pennsylvania. I understand and appreciate [Cuomo’s] decision, but I have made no decisions along any of those lines for Pennsylvania yet.

Wolf has already closed schools through the end of this academic year. His stay at home order allows for trips to life-sustaining businesses, such as grocery stores and pharmacies, but starting Sunday night, customers and employees will have to wear a mask to enter any of those locations.

Stores of more than 50,000 sq.ft. are to close off **areas of the store:** carpet or flooring, furniture, garden centers and plant nurseries, paint. 


That only applies to stores of more than 50,000 square feet, and it does NOT prevent any store from selling ANY products. They can sell garden supplies and seeds, just not in that area of the store. 

It looks very clear to me. If stores are interpreting it differently, that's their decision.

Remember - the point of it all is to limit the spread of the virus, by reducing contact between people. The point is to have fewer people in stores at the same time, and be farther away from people. Smaller stores already hold fewer people by default. Please keep your distance from people, it's not about you, it's about everyone else."

FAQ

Q: Why is your data different than OP's?

A: I pull my data from the [Ohio Coronavirus website](https://coronavirus.ohio.gov/wps/portal/gov/covid-19/home/dashboard) via a spreadsheet they update daily. That gives different numbers than what OP posts. 

From my understanding, rather than just saying ""we have 400 new cases today"" they backdate some of the cases to the day they likely actually contracted the virus. So the total remains the same, but the daily amount changes. For example, on 4/7 the number of cases on 4/6 was 56. On 4/8 the number of cases on 4/6 went up to 137."

>(CNN)With coronavirus severely affecting the potato supply chain, a farm in Idaho is giving away about 2 million potatoes so they don't go to waste. First come, first served.

>Ryan Cranney, CEO of Cranney Farms in Oakley, Idaho, about 150 miles from Boise, told CNN the majority of his potatoes from the farm are typically sold to grocery stores and to restaurants to make french fries.

>Because of stay-at-home orders throughout the nation, Cranney said the food service demand is down significantly, leaving him with six months worth of crop.

>""With people staying at home, these restaurants have shut down and so our markets have just kind of fallen apart,"" Cranney said. ""The factories that we sell to for french fries, they've lost their sales and had to shut their factories down with freezers full of french fries and so the outlets for our potatoes, we're having a difficult time getting them to market.""

>A little over 50% of Cranney's sales come from its potato crop, according to Cranney.

>Cranney Farms also grows sugar beats, wheat, barley, mustard seeds, corn and alfalfa and they raise cattle, but Cranney said their potato crop and cattle have been hit the hardest.

>""We've made our best assumptions so we're cutting back what we're going to grow this year,"" Cranney said. ""If things turn around quickly and take off, we're going to be short. But if it drags on longer for several more months, it could be a total disaster. People are going to lose their farms over this.""

>Initially, Cranney said he posted about the crop on Facebook, urging members of his community of about 700 people to show up at the farm and grab as many potatoes as they want. But now, people are driving hours to pick some up.

>""The response has completely blown me away,"" Cranney said. ""People are coming from all over the place.""

>Cranney said he's expecting a woman from Kansas on Thursday who will have driven 19 hours. Food banks and soup kitchens are also starting to show up.

>Most of the people who have come for the potatoes are doing it for others, grabbing them for friends and neighbors.

>""We gave a little bit and now they're giving in return, and that's what made it worth it to me,"" Cranney said. ""It's been fun for me to see people thinking of others and give their time and resources to take care of other people.""

Further, says Paul, a doctor and former United States House of Representatives member, “right now I wouldn’t think there is any indication for anybody to take them,” noting that “scare tactics” are being used to pressure people into thinking they should take such potential vaccines to protect against coronavirus.

Paul supports this conclusion by stressing in the interview the potential danger of a vaccine as well as the overstated threat from coronavirus.

Regarding the potential danger from a coronavirus vaccine, Paul discusses at the beginning of the interview how, in 1976 in his first week as a House member, Paul was one of only two members, both doctors, who voted against legislation that helped rush through a vaccine in response to swine flu. Paul describes the results of the push for people to take the swine flu vaccine as follows:

They rushed the vaccine through. The vaccine was not properly made. It had nothing to do with the virus that was out there, so it saved nobody’s life from it. It caused a lot of harm. More people ended up dying from the inoculation than died from the flu that year. And that sort of was a lesson, like that’s a little bit too extreme. But, that’s about what happens when governments get involved and you do things for political reasons.

There was also, because a lot of people ended up getting the vaccine, I think there were like 50 people or more who got Guillain-Barré syndrome, which is temporary total paralysis and you can die from it but most of them did get better. But, it was a very, very serious complication of a viral injection, you know, a vaccine


Paul also discusses in the interview the overstated danger from coronavirus that is being used to scare people to take actions including to potentially take a coronavirus vaccine.

Paul notes that many of the people whose deaths have been blamed on coronavirus are elderly people, including people living in nursing homes, who have multiple other diseases. Further, explains Paul, doctors have “been instructed by [the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention] and other politicians that, when the doctors sign the death certificate, if [patients] have four different things but they happen to have a positive test for the virus that is to be put down as the major cause of death.”

“The numbers mean nothing,” concludes Paul regarding the daily tabulation of coronavirus deaths."

>Trump said doctors he's come across as the administration tries to  get a handle on the outbreak have been surprised about how much he knows  about COVID-19. ""Maybe I have a natural ability,"" he said. ""Maybe I  should have done that instead of running for president.""

For example it probably didn't benefit a construction worker that had his wages undercut by cheaper workforce, but it sure as hell benefited his employer that could hire cheaper workers. And it benefitted everyone else that could for example had their home renovated for cheaper price.     

Overall, I think you mostly benefited from it, some of your industries are now very dependent of cheap workforce - current example is your agricultural sectors not having workers because of coronavirus and locals don't want to work there. Germany sent planes to Romania to bring seasonal workers for their fields. By extension everyone of you benefits from it, because if farmers can produce things cheaper, you can buy them cheaper in stores."

This certainly looks like the standard for liberal democratic nations.

Now your quote: 

> The way Korea handles their society is fundamentally different from the values that the USA or the west would adopt willingly

**Ironically, they are adopting lockdowns, following CHina's lead**

I'll also point out, they are adopting South Korea's phone-tracking methods (Google x Apple teaming up, I""m sure you've heard)."

>Vice: Shocking new data shows that along with the 95 percent increase in child porn consumption, there’s also been a 200 percent spike in searches for videos

>ICPF: 95% --> Data from Pornhub, the largest pornography website in the world, shows that traffic from India on its website has increased by 95% between 24thand 26thMarch 2020, as compared to their average traffic, pre-Coronavirus.

95% is OVERALL porn search, not just CP.

>ICPF: 200% --> The demand for child pornography was an average of 5 million per month in 100 cities and only on the public web. A vast majority of individuals were interested in generic CSAM content involving ‘school girls sex’, the demand for content with specific age groups, sexual actions and locations was growing as much as 200%.

So CSAM is CP. So 200% is 3x of 5 million, so 15 million. Of what? individuals or search hits? Unclear.

Parents should be vigilant and track the internet usage of children. They should also take advantage of parental controls in computer, mobile devices and make their social media accounts private.

>While the government machinery is focused on thwarting the spread of the coronavirus, criminals and predators anywhere in the world can exploit the closure of schools and increased usage of internet by children. In case of West Bengal, the commission already has a guideline on how to stay safe online. “We’ll share it again in our social media handles to aware parents as well as vulnerable groups,” said the WBCPCR chairperson.

He apologized. That's not enough. Wumaos dug deeper and found out he liked a tweet by his gf in which she linked a story speculating the coronavirus leaked from a Wuhan lab. Triggered 2.0. 

Still not enough. Dug even deeper and found out about an IG conversation years ago between the two lovebirds when they were holidaying in Taiwan. 
He said ""Nice dress. i like your Chinese girl style""
She said ""what?"" (comments left around explained that apparently there are nuances in Thai language. Its not like WTF what! More like expressing shyness huh?)
Another friend ""so what's the style?
She said ""Taiwanese girl style""

Triggered 3.0. Wumaos say she is supporting Taiwanese independence because she does not equate Chinese girl with Taiwanese girl.

All hell broke loose on both of them. Thai netizens came to their rescue, and attacked with HK and TW sensitive issues to counter wumaos offensive. Some HK and TW netizens joined in as reinforcements for the Thais.

The milk tea alliance is thus born to fight a common cause. Netizens from other countries pissed off with China asked if they can also join the alliance.

The Associated Press article from yesterday ""China didn't warn public of likely pandemic for 6 key days"" was downvoted into oblivion on this sub. AP is about as credible a source as you could ask for, the article is detailed and well sourced, and the content is extremely relevant to the Coronavirus discussion. 

Today it's still in top 30 of r-slash-news subreddit and it's being discussed and widely reported on in almost every major news outlet (Washington Post, Politico, Forbes, NY Post, Fox Business, CBC, LA times, CNN all carrying articles on it).  But yet somehow surprisingly the story remains buried here, I see one CNN article that talks about it \~40 posts down...  A quick read through shows both posts full of low effort generally anti-American and pro-CCP comments... (I'm guessing reply's to this post will probably be similar in nature).  What I'm saying is, at some point, doesn't the brigading by 50 cent Army or whoever become so obvious that you feel you should take some action?

For example, how about pinning a post to the top if it's clearly a relevant and credible source that's being widely reported and talked about across the world, but at the same time is obviously being brigaded by bad actors on this sub? You don't have to do this in all cases but even doing it a couple times would probably significantly dissuade the brigading."

>Obesity may be one of the most important predictors of severe coronavirus illness, new studies say. It’s an alarming finding for the United States, which has one of the highest obesity rates in the world.

>Though people with obesity frequently have other medical problems, the new studies point to the condition in and of itself as the most significant risk factor, after only older age, for being hospitalized with Covid-19, the illness caused by the coronavirus. Young adults with obesity appear to be at particular risk, studies show.

>The research is preliminary, and not peer reviewed, but it buttresses anecdotal reports from doctors who say they have been struck by how many seriously ill younger patients of theirs with obesity are otherwise healthy.

>No one knows why obesity makes Covid-19 worse, but hypotheses abound.

>Some coronavirus patients with obesity may already have compromised respiratory function that preceded the infection. Abdominal obesity, more prominent in men, can cause compression of the diaphragm, lungs and chest capacity. Obesity is known to cause chronic, low-grade inflammation and an increase in circulating, pro-inflammatory cytokines, which may play a role in the worst Covid-19 outcomes.

>Some 42 percent of American adults — nearly 80 million people — live with obesity. That is a prevalence rate far exceeding those of other countries hit hard by the coronavirus, like China and Italy.

>Obesity is defined by a measure called body mass index, which is based on a formula that divides one’s weight in kilograms by the square of one’s height in meters. Someone who is 5 feet 9 inches tall and weighs 203 pounds would have a B.M.I. of 30, which is considered obese.

>The new findings about obesity risks are bad news for all Americans, but particularly for African-Americans and other people of color, who have higher rates of obesity and are already bearing a disproportionate burden of Covid-19 deaths. High rates of obesity are also prevalent among low-income white Americans, who may also be adversely affected, experts say.

>More than half of Covid-19 deaths in the United States so far have been in New York and New Jersey, but the new findings mean the coronavirus could exact a steep toll in regions like the South and the Midwest, where obesity is more prevalent than in the Northeast.

>“If obesity does turn out to be an important risk factor for younger people, and we look at the rest of the United States — where obesity rates are higher than in New York — that will be of great concern,” said Dr. Roy Gulick, chief of infectious diseases at Weill Cornell Medicine. “We may see a lot more younger people being hospitalized.”

>Dr. Gulick’s review of data from the first 393 Covid-19 patients admitted to NewYork-Presbyterian/Weill Cornell Medical Center and NewYork-Presbyterian Lower Manhattan Hospital identified obesity as a risk factor for admission. He also found that among adults under the age of 54, half live with obesity, though the New York City obesity rate is only 22 percent.

>One of the largest U.S. studies to identify obesity as a prominent risk factor analyzed data from more than 4,000 Covid-19 patients who sought care at NYU Langone Health between March 1 and April 2.

>“Obesity is more important for hospitalization than whether you have high blood pressure or diabetes, though these often go together, and it’s more important than coronary disease or cancer or kidney disease, or even pulmonary disease,” said Dr. Leora Horwitz, the paper’s senior author and director of the Center for Healthcare Innovation and Delivery Science at NYU Langone.

>Obesity also appears to be a factor for higher risk of death from Covid-19, though to a lesser degree, Dr. Horwitz said

>She cautioned that the findings were preliminary, noted that some of the data was still incomplete and emphasized that the paper had not been peer reviewed.

>Scientists are still somewhat puzzled by the impact of obesity on the course of the disease, but Dr. Horwitz said the implications for patient care were clear.

>“It means that as clinicians, we should be thinking a little more carefully about those patients with obesity when they come in — we should worry about them a little bit more,” she said.

>Another NYU Langone study, which focused on patients under the age of 60, found that those with obesity were twice as likely to be hospitalized and were at even higher risk of requiring critical care. The association between obesity and more severe disease was not seen in patients over the age of 60.

>The severity of the illness often comes as a surprise to younger adults, and “provides another layer of shock to this disease,” the paper’s author, Dr. Jennifer Lighter, said.

>Studies highlighting the risks of obesity have been conducted in other countries as well.

>Though most of the early reports from China pointed to risk factors like Type 2 diabetes and hypertension, which are common in people with obesity, scientists in Shenzhen, China, reported in The Lancet this month that Covid-19 patients with a high body mass index were at more than double the risk of severe pneumonia than those with a lower B.M.I.

>Another study from China, which looked at outcomes among a group of 112 Covid-19 patients, reported that of the 17 patients who died, 15 were either overweight or obese.

>More recently, a French study reported that nearly half of 124 Covid-19 patients in Lille, France, had obesity, twice the rate of a comparison group of intensive care patients hospitalized for other reasons last year. The study also reported that the need for mechanical ventilation increased with higher body weight.

>At Ochsner Health, a system with 41 hospitals in Louisiana and southern Mississippi, Dr. Leo Seoane, the company’s senior vice president, said that 60 percent of patients hospitalized with Covid-19 had obesity and that obesity appeared to nearly double their risk of requiring a ventilator.

>“We in the U.S. have not always identified obesity as a disease, and some people think it’s a lifestyle choice. But it’s not,” said Dr. Matthew Hutter, director of the Weight Center at Massachusetts General Hospital and president of the American Society for Metabolic and Bariatric Surgery. “It makes people sick, and we’re realizing that now.”

>Conventional wisdom has traditionally explained excess weight as a simple caloric imbalance that can be addressed by eating less and exercising more. Prominent medical groups have reconsidered their approach, however, and now recognize obesity as a medical disorder caused by a complex web of underlying factors, which in turn predisposes people to other serious medical problems.

>Some doctors consider obesity a marker of poor health associated with poverty, reflecting a combination of social and economic factors, from inadequate education and limited job opportunities to impoverished neighborhoods where access to healthy food, medical care and opportunities for exercise are scarce.

>Obesity’s link to chronic diseases is well known, but the experience with H1N1 influenza in 2009 revealed that people with obesity are also more vulnerable to infectious diseases. Studies have also shown that they do not get the same protection from influenza vaccinations that others do.

>Physicians say patients with obesity can be harder to manage in the hospital setting. They require special beds and imaging equipment, and they are harder to intubate and harder to assess when removing a ventilator.

>Advocates for people with obesity say they may also delay seeking care, deterred because they have been treated poorly by health care providers in the past.

>“They worry: ‘If I go to the hospital, am I going to be triaged based on my body mass index? Is the skinny person next to me going to get the ventilator, not me?’” said Dr. Donna Ryan, associate editor in chief of the journal Obesity.

>Doctors in the trenches treating critically ill coronavirus patients say they expected to see old and elderly patients become acutely and critically ill, but the young patients becoming severely sick have unnerved them.

>Of the 14 Covid-19 patients recently in Dr. Sanam Ahmed’s critical care unit at Mount Sinai on the Upper East Side, she said, 12 were at least 50 years old and had complex medical problems. The two younger patients, who were in their 30s, had obesity and no other diseases.

>“It looks like, for them, obesity is the risk factor,” Dr. Ahmed said.

>For people with asthma, the outbreak of a pandemic that can lead to respiratory failure has not been a welcome event. Many health organizations have cautioned that asthmatics are most likely at higher risk for severe illness if they get the coronavirus. There’s been a run on inhalers, and coronavirus patients like the actor Idris Elba have openly worried about their asthma.

>But this month, when New York State, the epicenter of the outbreak in the United States, began releasing data on the top 10 chronic health problems suffered by people who died from coronavirus, asthma was notably absent from the list. State officials said only about five percent of Covid-19 deaths in New York were of people who were known to also have asthma, a relatively modest amount.

>The research at this early stage is minimal and not always consistent, as one would expect. A recent commentary published in Lancet by a group of European researchers called it “striking” that asthma appeared “to be underrepresented in the comorbidities reported for patients with Covid-19” — comorbidity being the term for a secondary health problem. A small study of 24 critically ill patients in Washington State noted that three had asthma.

>“We’re not seeing a lot of patients with asthma,” said Dr. Bushra Mina, a pulmonary and critical care physician at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City, which has treated more than 800 Covid cases. The more common risk factors, he added, are “morbid obesity, diabetes and chronic heart disease.”

>The top Covid-19 comorbidities listed by New York, in order, are hypertension, diabetes, high cholesterol, coronary artery disease, dementia and atrial fibrillation, a heart condition. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, another respiratory ailment, but one with an older demographic than asthma, ranks seventh. Renal disease, cancer and congestive heart failure round out the list.

>Nearly eight percent of the U.S. population — close to 25 million people — has asthma, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. It is a lung disease that causes the airways to constrict and can make breathing hard work as the body fights for enough oxygen. Symptoms include wheezing and coughing.

>One thing doctors agree on is that people with asthma should be taking long acting medications like steroids that keep their symptoms in check, because having your asthma under control is better than battling asthma and a virus simultaneously.

>Health experts have generally seen little to no evidence that asthma increases the risk of developing Covid-19, but the question has been whether it causes worse outcomes for those who do have it.

>“If you have mild or moderate disease, you’re probably not going to behave much differently than someone who doesn’t have asthma, particularly if you’re a younger person,” said Dr. David Hill, a board member of the American Lung Association. But he added that those with more severe cases “may get more severity of the disease.”

>Dr. Linda Rogers, a specialist in pulmonary medicine at the Mt. Sinai Health system, which is on the front line of Covid treatment, said one would assume that patients with underlying lung diseases would be “at risk of worse outcomes.” But she said that “asthma is underrepresented” in patients that are sick enough to seek treatment.

>Her practice focuses on people with more serious cases of asthma, but she has been able to successfully manage many of her asthma patients through telemedicine. “These are patients who, just based on their asthma alone, are on steroids all the time. I’m just surprised some of them haven’t done worse.”

>Still, the data analysis on the effects of asthma is in its infancy, and health experts cited an existing body of research that shows the flu and milder coronaviruses exacerbate asthma as worrisome indicators for those with Covid-19. Dr. Rogers said that she did not want to exclude asthma “as a potential problem as it is well known that viral infections are the No. 1 cause of asthma flares in both children and adults under normal conditions.”

>Dr. J. Allen Meadows, president of the American College of Allergy, Asthma and Immunology, said much the same: “Since common coronaviruses in the United States, and influenza, trigger asthma flares in well controlled patients, we might expect Covid-19 to be similar.”

>One doctor who has studied viruses extensively is Young J. Juhn, a clinical epidemiologist, and professor of pediatrics and medicine at the Mayo Clinic, whose laboratory research has examined the impact of asthma on the risk of infectious and inflammatory diseases.

>Dr. Juhn said the data would have to be studied and weighted in more detail, but added that, in his view, asthma put people at greater risk of poor outcomes, and potentially even more susceptible to infection, though there was limited data on the latter point. He noted that asthma disproportionately affects lower-income people who have less access to Covid testing and care.

>“It may be still fair to say that the emerging data support the current guidelines considering asthma as a high-risk condition,” he cautioned, adding that “we need more definite data.”"

And again, as late as March 24th:

>We lose thousands and thousands of people a year to the flu.  We don’t turn the country off — I mean, every year. Now, when I heard the number — you know we average 37,000 people a year.

everyone knows the subway contributes to the spread of coronavirus. so do hospitals. you can't shut public transportation down indefinitely without offering an alternative way for people to get to work, otherwise all of society would quickly collapse. the people keeping everything from becoming anarchy still need to get to their jobs.

don't get me wrong, there were definitely mistakes made, e.g. telling people for weeks that they shouldn't be wearing masks. and more could have been done, e.g. redistributing all citi bikes and bike shop inventories to ""essential workers"" who are capable of commuting by bike instead of public transportation.

but without an available alternative shutting the subway down was never a viable option even if it would have obviously helped spread the virus."

That's because they classify those deaths as COVID-19. Our numbers are fucked *against* the US, not *in favor* of the US.

Bankruptcies and distressed companies could give Amazon the opportunity to expand its retail footprint in ways that it could only dream of before as its Whole Foods acquisition. This could set the tone for an even bigger retail expansion in the coming years that could help drive additional increases in future revenues for the company as year-over-year (Y/Y) sales look to possibly astound. 
Amazon has done a phenomenal job changing and adapting to the times and creating opportunity when other companies hesitate. While most companies and economies are reeling from coronavirus, Amazon is hiring like it is the holiday season with a possible sales explosion that could help the market rerate its stock. Amazon's success with its Whole Foods acquisition, along with a potential future expansion of Go stores, could mean a rapid retail expansion for Amazon across the globe as bankruptcies could abound in the wake of coronavirus. My Amazon position has grown from a formerly small position at the beginning of the year into one of my largest individual stock holdings. Best of luck to all.

Before Bjelica got the job as Dinamo coach, he had his own terms before joining and the Mamic brothers accepted all of his terms.
The terms were mostly around Bjelica having full control over the available transfer budget (meaning he could get any player he wants, if the finances are ok) and the team overall. That means that the Mamic brothers didn't have any influence nor managerial control over any player of Dinamo in the past 2 years.
That's also the main reason why Dinamo played really good was so successful in those 2 years.

The Mamic brothers took the chance through the Coronavirus crisis to get rid of Bjelica and gain full control over the club once again.

That's also the main reason why the younger Mamic came back to Dinamo after his spell in Saudi Arabia. Now, when Bjelica has been sacked, the younger Mamic is looking once again for coaching job on the Arabian peninsula, far away from Croatian jurisdiction."

No one was even symptomatic at the practice.  

On March 10, there were very few cases reported.  Even now, there’s just shy of 2000 reported in Snohomish Country.  But ONE 2.5 hour unmasked rehearsal among “healthy” people directly resulted in FORTY FIVE CASES AND TWO FATALITIES.

People don’t grasp how communicable this is, how much more communicable than flu, SARS, MERS, and Ebola.  

They don’t grasp that for those - of all ages - who get pneumonia, recovery is taking months - as long as open-heart surgery. 

They don’t grasp that if you are lucky enough to get a ventilator to save your life, and then even luckier to get off the ventilator, the doctors may not be able to keep you sedated because *they’re running out of those drugs.* So it will be traumatic hell, if you do survive, and we are just now finding out about the long-term organ damage you will live with.  

And all this doesn’t take into account the financial catastrophe that accompanies nearly all major illness and hospitalization in our society - even if you do have insurance. Or the heartbreak you will live with for the rest of your life if you, before you show any symptoms, infect your folks or your grandfolks, and cause them to go through this nightmare - even if they survive. 

So, no.  No to gyms, which are places where people inhale and exhale with greater than usual intensity. Which are indoors by definition, where the equipment is stationary. No to gyms until we have comprehensive testing, and we know who can safely share air and droplets in public and who cannot.  

Gyms are only essential to the people who rely on them for income. There are safety net programs in place to help those folks get by until they can move into alternative employment.

Luigi, a patient in Parma's Maggiore Hospital, fought against Covid-19 and wants to leave his testimony: telling those terrible and infinite days passed wearing a helmet for artificial ventilation.

He had to wear it as a device for patients with respiratory problems, who are not intubated.

""It was friday, february 28th. I had shivers and fever. Days were passing by, fever and coughing were not diminishing. I make my mind up and called the doctor: 'Don't worry, it's just a seasonal flu. Take these medicines'. Days still went by.

March 4th, doctor came visit me: 'I guarantee you, this is not Coronavirus. Your lungs are clean, take these medicines and you'll be good.' Some other days go by. I start gasping for air. Fever is still there. I can't sleep anymore. I've got pain at my back, diarrhea. I call the doctor: 'If you're gasping you have to go to the hospital'.

Monday, march 9th, the ambulance arrives, a girl comes down, puts my finger into the device to measure my oxygen, then she says: 'Yup, we better go. If this was not the case we wouldn't send you, because the hospital is congested in these days'.

We arrive at the hospital, they've arranged a very provisional dedicated area, it's drizzling and I'm just half in-half out: I'm cold and getting wet. Nurses are facing new procedures and it shows they're clearly struggling. I wait, staggering, but they eventually let me in. It seems like a movie. People complaining everywhere. A doctor visits me, then puts me on a seat with an oxygen tank and some visors.

I wait. Can't really tell how long. I'm still staggering. I call for the doctors and at this point they hospitalize me. It's late in the evening by now. I'm in a first department where they try to assess youe pathology. They immediately put me on the most potent mask they have because I'm lacking oxygen. Next day they take my scrub. My lack of oxygen is even more severe and they put me on the respiratory helmet. The next day results come in and I'm positive, so they put me in another area, specialized for Covid-19.

They coulnd't invent a more infernal device than that. You have your head inside this 'thing' that grasps your neck, you feel a pressure like when you're riding a motorbike with your mouth open, your ears keep closing up, you hear this constant high-pitched noise from the fans. You're sensing suffocation, and fear. I can't seem to get used to breathe like this, it's just unnatural.

My lungs muscles hurt. My neck is pressed against an hard plate, and it hurts as well. I can't touch anything, I can't turn my back. After a short while you can't stand it anymore. You feel like a straw amidst a tempest sea, and your mind doesn't process things in the usual manner anymore, you just enter a deformed reality. They put me on morphine. Twice. Still, it doesn't seem to help.

I call the doctors again and they say I must wear it, there are just no alternatives. I can't take it anymore. My lungs are exploding. I call them, unlatch everything in front of them and I take the thing off. But there's just not air to breathe, and they scold me. I don't really know what to do anymore. 'If you refuse to wear it you'll need to be transfered to ICU'. My world is falling apart, but in that precise moment I realize 'you must find a way to wear that helmet'.

As I quickly elaborate this, I ask the doctors to have someone near me who knows this device, to try to set in a more appropriate way. They agree and a person comes, and listening to me, fine tune the machine.

The night passes and it seemes to feel a little better. But the next morning, again, I can't take it anymore. Six consecutive hours is too much. I just can't.

I talk to the medics and tell them that I can do 4 hours maximum, not 6. I have to do an hour break and then I can put the helmet back on again. They consult themselves and try to insist to mantain the 6 hours. I insist as well and in the end we agree on cycles of 4 houys, with the promise to wear it at least 4-5 hours a day. It's difficult, very difficult, also because your mouth dries to the point that your lips start to flake. If you close it, it just glues it all together. They say I can't drink to much, because my arms are so swallen that they seem about to explode. When I ask to drink something, they pass me a straw through a hole so thin that pulling is almost an unbearable effort.

I somewhat manage to do 4 hours cycls. I even learn to drink on my own without any assistance (you just needed to pull the lower membrane with your hand and let the straw comfortably pass). They see me and start laughing because nobody ever thought of that. I succesfully keep my promises. Now it's me calling the nurses when my break is over.

They seem surprised by my constance and agree to let me go on like this. But in this two-week period I saw three people around me not being able to wear the helmet and, after many cryses, two of them have been transfered to ICU. And one of them, Mario, has been found dead in the morning. May he rest in peace.

I eventually befriended with my helmet. I managed to become attached to it, and keep repeating that it would eventually made me recover. I repeated that on every breath. But my eye was constantly on the clock, and those 4 hours never seemed to pass. When you're inside that thing your reality is deformed, and you get used even to this. Medics were surprised by my way of dealing with things, but they also see some positive results. I'm constantly improving. They can tell by the Co2 in my blood, shown from a very painful blood draw. But I start to see some light at the end of the tunnel.

Doctor says that she's satisfied and that I could be the third patient who eventually get to have his helmet succesfully removed. The other two patients only wore it for some days.

I keep on wearing the helmet until some fine day doctor finally tells me: 'Luigi, we're going fine and today we try to remove the helmet'. It was march, the 26th.

A new world disclosed, I was psyched beyond any measure. Doctor was so proud of me, for being able to mantain the helmet for so long.

They start to progressively reduce the oxygen intake. All in all, with some highs and lows the path went well. I've had to switch different masks and air/oxygen mix percentages, always daily monitored by that painful artery draw to evaluate my Co2.

It all seem to go so well, and the possibility to come home for Easter starts to cross everybody's mind. It will be wonderful!

In the meantime I try to get up from bed but it's all difficult. I'm immediately panting. Can't do it. My balance won't hear about it. It's like when you quickly run in circles and then you let yourself go. I fall. I don't have enough power.

Yesterday my last scrub result came in, and I'm still positive. Doctor, seeing me panting, raised the oxygen a bit. I was a bit disheartened at first, but then I thought that I've reached such great results so far, I can handle a little downer.

One night when I was really bad and I was under the respirator, a nurse came by. She was young and surely pretty (they're all covered up to the eyes around here). She sat on my bed and started crying. Maybe she just needed to vent it out. I tried to reassure her, said that everything would go fine. From that point on, she became my angel. She even gave me her number. Once all of this will be over, some day, I want to meet her.

Today is Easter 2020, for sure one of the most beautiful Easters in my life, not only for me but also for my relatives who suffered praying that everything could change for the better. I really feel like I came to a new life. It's like I picked the lucky card in the deck, and that gave me a new possibility. Really, I'm born again.

I'm happy! I think I'll live the remaining of my life with a different angle. Maybe a simpler one, but more emotional.

My wish for everybody is to listen and understand other people before talking. World could become a better place!"""

This article has been a topic of some discussion among my colleagues for a couple of weeks now.  The authors propose a new mechanism by which this virus could cause disease....however, there are a number of glaring problems with this study and as such, it has not gained much traction in academic circles. 

As an example, in this current revision (as of April 16th, 2020), the authors claim that the S protein of SARS-CoV-2 ""...only weakly binds to the ACE2 receptor compared to SARS coronavirus"", leading them to conclude that ""the pathogenicity mechanism of the novel coronavirus remains mysterious"".  The authors support this claim by citing a paper ([link here](https://f1000research.com/articles/9-121)) which was found itself to have serious flaws in peer review.  In fact, there are now two independent published reports in [Cell](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S009286742030338X) (the journal) and in [Nature Cellular & Molecular Immunology](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41423-020-0400-4)  demonstrating that the S protein of SARS-CoV-2 actually binds the ACE2 receptor of humans MORE STRONGLY than the original SARS coronavirus does.  So, the authors are (at this point) misleading their readers by citing debunked literature as the basis of their own study.

Additionally, the authors use *in silico* molecular docking simulations as the **sole support** for their hypothesis regarding this new pathology mechanism.  As someone who has done a handful of these simulations himself, I'm concerned that they're fundamentally misunderstanding what these studies are meant to accomplish.  The dirty-little-secret of molecular docking simulations is that you can play around with the parameters such that pretty much any two reasonably sized molecules are shown to bind each other (or don't bind each other if it suits your narrative).  As a result, serious scientists only use molecular docking simulations **in conjunction with actual experiments** to demonstrate protein-protein interactions. 

For instance, if you screen a large number of molecules and find preliminary experimental evidence of two molecules binding - you might perform a molecular docking simulation to generate a hypothesis of HOW those two molecules interact with each other.  In the case of proteins, you could then test this hypothesis by mutating the proteins and observing whether the computational model's predictions are accurate or not.  At no point in this paper do the authors offer any modicum of experimental evidence that the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein binds human heme or human porphyrin.

The manuscript is also rife with typos and incorrect grammar, is missing numerous critical citations, and MASSIVELY overstates the implications of their strictly computational study.  If I were asked to review this study as a peer-reviewer (which I have not been), I would recommend that it be rejected for having committed the cardinal sin of making an extraordinary conclusion (i.e. a novel mechanism of pathology and a novel mechanism of treatment) without extraordinary evidence (at minimum, in-vitro binding experiments)."

>An email containing a now-famous memo from the captain of the USS Theodore Roosevelt aircraft carrier was sent to fewer people than the Navy said it was when officials justified firing him, The Washington Post reported Thursday.

>The email from Capt. Brett Crozier was sent to three admirals and copied to seven other captains, according to a copy obtained by the Post, contradicting former acting Navy Secretary Thomas Modly’s assertion it was sent to “20 or 30” people.

>Attached to the email was the letter Crozier wrote pleading for help with a coronavirus outbreak aboard the Roosevelt. The letter has now been widely reported, but the email it was attached to had not been released before the Post’s report.

>In the email, Crozier called the recipients “incredible leaders” who he would “gladly … follow into battle whenever need.”

>“I fully realize that I bear responsibility for not demanding more decisive action the moment we pulled in, but at this point my only priority is the continued well-being of the crew and embarked staff,” Crozier wrote. “As you know, the accountability of a commanding officer is absolute, and I believe if there is ever a time to ask for help it is now regardless of the impact on my career.”

>The email was addressed to Rear Adm. Stuart Baker, commander of the Roosevelt's carrier strike group; Adm. John Aquilino, commander of U.S. Pacific Fleet; and Vice Adm. DeWolfe Miller, commander of Naval Air Forces. Seven other captains were copied on the email.

>An unnamed senior defense official told the Post that Crozier could have sent what's known as a “personal for” message to senior service leaders that would have flagged the issue as sensitive and important without looping in as many people.

>Crozier was fired after the attached memo — which warned that “sailors do not have to die” — leaked to the press.

>At a news conference announcing Crozier’s firing, Modly cited the number of people the email was sent to as one of the reasons he lost confidence in Crozier's ability to command the ship.

>“It was copied to 20 or 30 other people,"" Modly said then. ""That's just not acceptable. He did not take care and what that did is it created a little bit of a panic on the ship.""

>Modly later resigned after traveling to Guam to give a speech aboard the Roosevelt where he called Crozier “stupid” or “naive.”

>Vice Chief of Naval Operations Adm. Robert Burke conducted an investigation into the situation on the Roosevelt. The results are being reviewed by Chief of Naval Operations Adm. Michael Gilday and are expected to be released as soon as this week.

>Top officials have not ruled out reinstating Crozier when the investigation is done, with Defense Secretary Mark Esper

It's honestly pretty baffling as to why it's happening. It was a single Right wing protest at our state capital over the stay-at-home orders that our governor has put into place. I'd say they're mostly upset because they live in rural and suburban places of the state that aren't as affected by coronavirus. whereas the disease has  been most present in urban parts of the state and the Detroit metro area more specifically. but they still have to adhere to the laws and think they are in danger of getting tickets and fines.

As for the guns, it's pretty typical of Right wing political action in America to always be armed. It's not that surprising but it is very aggravating to see them posturing like this. 

They ended up blocking traffic around the capital building and the hospital with their vehicles. Which seems pretty honestly evil considering the circumstances. 

I think there's also another dimension going on here that involves the ""feud"" between our state governor and our president. Having strong state policy keeping people at home is a political barrier to Trump's desire to reopen the country for the sake of the ""economy"". Not to mention the sparring match they had over federal aid and the handling of this at the early stages.

All things considered this is pretty embarrassing for the state and  doesn't make these people look good."

If you are still employed, you can consider yourself lucky. There are plenty of people who have found themselves unwillingly on Centrelink payments because their roles no longer exist due to the coronavirus pandemic.

If you have a role, *yes, you need to turn up*. You can't just camp at home and expect to be paid via JobKeeper/JobSeeker stimulus payments, and then waltz back into work after all of this has blown over as if nothing has happened.

No, your manager is not being unfair in asking you to actually perform your role. If you would *rather not* as opposed to being unable to do so, you have the option of resigning. No, you won't get stimulus payments after doing this. 

I'm getting sick and tired of threads started by people who don't want to go to work, only for them to delete the thread and retreat with their tails between their legs when they are told they're not going to get free money from the Federal Government.

In compenso, per il momento giro a chiunque sia interessato e conosca l'inglese degli interventi che tracciano con chiarezza, lucidità ed abbondanza di fonti non solo perché si parla di malagestione cinese ma anche di un OMS fin troppo ""amico"" al PCC:

* [**The WHO v coronavirus: why it can't handle the pandemic**](https://www.theguardian.com/news/2020/apr/10/world-health-organization-who-v-coronavirus-why-it-cant-handle-pandemic)**:** ottimo articolo del Guardian, datato 10 aprile. Spiega bene il passato recente dell'OMS, la figura di Tedros, e le differenze nella reazione OMS a questa pandemia rispetto ad epidemie/pandemie passate (v. SARS, H1N1, Ebola).
* [**How early signs of the coronavirus were spotted, spread and throttled in China**](https://www.straitstimes.com/asia/east-asia/how-early-signs-of-the-coronavirus-were-spotted-spread-and-throttled-in-china): una carrellata ben fatta sulla copertura avvenuta in Cina delle prime, cruciali avvisaglie di questa pandemia.

* [**The Truth about ""Dramatic Action""**](https://chinamediaproject.org/2020/01/27/dramatic-actions/): come al link precedente, questo è invece uno sguardo cinese sulla reazione del governo locale e centrale all'epidemia nelle prime cruciali settimane, evidenziandone, ancora una volta, le gravi, criminali negligenze.
   * ""**The focus of restrictions was to prevent the truth of human-to-human transmission of the coronavirus from getting out. Wuhan officials continued to emphasize through January 14 that no clear evidence of human-to-human transmission had been found. \[...\]** Wang Guangfa (王广发), a member of the expert group from Beijing, came out and stressed that the disease was “preventable and controllable.” In light of these statements, the public remained unaware and unconcerned.""
   * ""**Up to January 17, tourism authorities in Wuhan continued to launch the “Spring Festival Culture Benefitting the People Campaign” (春节文化惠民活动), issuing hundreds of thousands of free tickets to attractions in Wuhan in order to encourage tourists from all over the country to come to the area for sightseeing. Through to January 19, Baibuting Garden (武汉市百步亭社区), an area advertised as a model residential community in Wuhan, was still holding a Spring Festival banquet celebration for its 40,000 residents.** There was no attempt to stem the flow of people to Wuhan from all over the country and around the world. During what was the most critical phase for controlling the outbreak, Wuhan was essentially an open city owing to the efforts of local officials to keep a lid on the story.""
      * Mentre la Cina gestiva questa emergenza con i piedi e con i suoi soliti modi da dittatura, minacciando di prigione i whistleblowers e azzittendo le voci critiche, Tedros (il direttor-generale dell'OMS) il 28 gennaio se ne usciva con [questo bello statement ufficiale](https://www.who.int/news-room/detail/28-01-2020-who-china-leaders-discuss-next-steps-in-battle-against-coronavirus-outbreak) in cui loda, tra altre cose, ""la trasparenza"" del governo cinese. E non si è mica fermato lì: per la Cina l'OMS ha avuto sempre e solo lodi sperticate dal giorno 1 di questa pandemia.
      * E prima che qualcuno venga a dire ""ma era solo il governo di Wuhan ad essere oscurantista, non quello centrale, che invece è stato trasparente"" - vi invito a leggere questo articolo e il precedente.
* [**Fighting the Coronavirus Pandemic: China's Influence at the World Health Organization**](https://www.institutmontaigne.org/en/blog/fighting-coronavirus-pandemic-chinas-influence-world-health-organization): spiega benissimo - e in maniera estremamente equilibrata - la lapalissiana reticenza dell'OMS a criticare la reazione cinese al coronavirus.
   * ""DG Tedros’ permanent and forceful endorsement of Chinese actions throughout the crisis has, of course, created a counter-reaction: the organization itself is now accused of having missed the opportunity to forestall a global pandemic. This is the result of two decisions. First, WHO’s failure to recognize proven human-to-human contamination until January 23 (and going along on [January 14 with China’s refusal to admit human to human contamination](https://twitter.com/who/status/1217043229427761152?s=21)), despite strong and persistent indications to the contrary, and alerts by Taiwanese health officials directly conveyed to the WHO. Second, the organization’s refusal to declare a pandemic until March 11, when 114 countries had already reported 118,000 cases. These decisions have had global consequences, as WHO guidelines are for better or for worse followed by countries and even by private actors who can base – and later justify – their actions from these guidelines. Such was the case for example in France, where public authorities were still saying there was no proof of human to human contamination on January 20. Beyond the issue of what WHO can do at times of epidemics, there is a ripple effect from its statements.""

Se a tutto questo si aggiungono altre inezie tipo:

* Essersi scagliati contro quei Paesi che legittimamente imponevano restrizioni ai viaggiatori per piacere e business da e verso la Cina;
* Aver consigliato per più di un mese e mezzo (quello cruciale) di fare test solamente a chi mostrasse sintomi E avesse visitato le zone colpite o fosse stato a contatto con qualcuno tornato da una zona colpita... per poi, il 5 marzo, cambiare strategia repentinamente e dire ""test test test, testate tutti i casi sospetti"", permettendosi anche di bacchettare chi non lo facesse già;
* Aver fatto per più di un mese e mezzo totale e imperdonabile disinformazione sul ruolo delle mascherine (chirurgiche e non);
* Aver girato le spalle alla scienza ed essersi calati le braghe completamente di fronte a Xi, [eliminando le cure tradizionali cinesi dalla lista dei trattamenti non efficaci ](https://sverigesradio.se/sida/artikel.aspx?programid=2054&artikel=7426566)sul sito web OMS:

On March 7th, China’s health authority issued new guidelines to fight the virus. **The guidelines state that traditional Chinese medicine should be used and encouraged.**

>The announcement came in a news release from Democratic Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, sent on behalf of all the participating governors.

>""Our number one priority when analyzing when best to reopen our economy is the health and safety of our citizens,"" the governors said in a joint statement.

>""We will make decisions based on facts, science, and recommendations from experts in health care, business, labor, and education,"" the statement added.

>The governors said they will home in on at least four factors when determining when best to reopen the economy: sustained control of the rate of new infections and hospitalizations, enhanced ability to test and trace, sufficient health care capacity to handle resurgence and best practices for social distancing in the workplace.

>Similar collaborations have been undertaken by governors in recent days on the West and East coasts.

>Two of the governors involved in the new group -- Republican Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine and Democratic Wisconsin Gov. Tony Evers -- made announcements on Thursday afternoon that suggest their states are looking toward how to reopen.

>DeWine said in a news briefing that he is developing a plan for a new phase of the state's response to coronavirus to start on May 1. Details of the new phase will come in the next few weeks, DeWine said.

>He added that talks need to continue with his group of economic advisers and speak with school district superintendents about how to reopen schools and businesses in the state, he said. The plan is to issue new guidance when they determine the best steps to move forward, DeWine said.

>Evers, meanwhile, extended his state's stay-at-home order until May 26 but loosened some restrictions on businesses, a statement from the governor's office read.

>Golf courses are now allowed to open again, and public libraries and arts and crafts stores may offer curb-side pickup, the announcement said. However, the statement also notes that public and private K-12 schools will remain closed for the remainder of the 2019-2020 school year.

>The order also directs essential businesses to ramp up disinfection and for retail stores to limit the number of people inside stores.

>""The order implements some new measures to ensure safety and support the progress we've made in containing Covid-19, but also allows certain activities to start up again,"" the statement read.

Dr Li Wenliang was notified of this by a colleague who saw those sequence findings and he put the information on a private WeChat group. That action got him in trouble with local police later on.

By end December, doctors throughout Wuhan already knew that a SARS-like virus was on the loose, causing clusters of severe pneumonia. H2H transmission through a respiratory route should have been suspected then.

Vision Medicals:

>A different social media post, believed to have been made by a Vision Medicals employee, sheds more light on the company’s early work. The author of the post, made on Jan. 28, said only that they worked at a private company based in Huangpu, Guangzhou, where Vision Medicals is located. The post’s author said they noticed a close similarity with the SARS coronavirus in test results of a sample collected on Dec. 24, but decided to study the results more closely before returning them, due their significance. The company did, however, share the data with the Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, according to the article.

>**On Dec. 27, the lab worked had sequenced most of the virus’s genome and had confirmed it was a coronavirus similar to SARS virus, the article said.**

CapitalBio:

>While researchers at Vision Medicals mulled their findings, the Central Hospital of Wuhan sent swabs from two other patients with the mysterious pneumonia to a Beijing-based lab, CapitalBio Medlab Co. Ltd., for study. One of the samples came from a 41-year-old man who had no history of contact with the seafood market, who was admitted on Dec. 27.

>**Test results delivered by the company showed a false positive for SARS.** It was a “small mistake,” a gene sequencing expert told Caixin, which may have been down to a limited gene database or a lack of retesting. But it was this mistake that triggered the first concerns heard by the public — recalling painful memories of the cover-up that defined the SARS outbreak 17 years before. 

>On the evening of Dec. 30, several doctors in Wuhan, including the late **Li Wenliang, privately shared CapitalBio’s results as a warning to friends and colleagues to take protective measures**. Those messages then circulated widely online and sparked a public uproar demanding more information. Several people, including Li and two other doctors who sent the messages that night, were later punished by authorities for “spreading rumors.”

BGI:

>Several other genomics companies also tested samples from patients in Wuhan with the then-unidentified virus in late December, Caixin learned. Industry leader BGI received a sample from a Wuhan hospital on Dec. 26. **Sequencing was completed by Dec. 29, and showed while it was not the virus that causes SARS, or severe acute respiratory syndrome, it was a previously unseen coronavirus that was about 80% similar to the virus that causes SARS.**

>A BGI source told Caixin that when they undertook the sequencing project in late December the company was unaware that the virus had sickened many people. “We take a lot of sequencing commissions every day,” the source said. Caixin has learned that the Wuhan hospital sent BGI at least 30 samples from different pneumonia cases for sequencing in December, and three were found to contain the new coronavirus. In addition to the Dec. 26 case, the second and third positive samples were received on Dec. 29 and Dec. 30. They were tested together and the results were reported to the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission as early as Jan. 1. 

>On Jan. 1, gene sequencing companies received an order from Hubei’s health commission to stop testing and destroy all samples, according to an employee at one. “If you test it in the future, be sure to report it to us,” the person said they were told by phone."

I've gone through CBT, and CPT both did wonders. I will say that most people cannot afford those treatments, or they just aren't available. I was given a book via a giveaway on the /r/coronavirus subreddit called the cognitive behavioral workbook for depression: a step by step program. This program won't help much with severe PTSD, like I had, as CPT is almost necessary for that due to how it is setup, and how the patient is extremely likely to react. However, this book absolutely can help with depression, anxiety, and constant procrastination. 

I've been forcing myself to read it for 5 minutes a day, sometimes I read 2 chapters because I enjoy the content sometimes I read 2 pages because I don't want to hear the truth lol. It's helped immensely, as my depression never faded, but the majority of my out of control cognitive distortions had their loop broken. I still have some, and chances are everyone has had these at one time or another, but the difference is learning to accept and work through them. I was suicidal for a decade, I stopped being suicidal a month or so after my CPT ended, but I was still hopeless. Today, I woke up and found out that my AC in my car blew, after getting my government $1200 in my bank account. I immediately thought ""Good thing I got $1200."". Then I sat there in awe... The hopelessness, the anger, the fustration, the tone of grey over my life wasn't there. I still feel a bit depressesed, I want to be able to go work out again and I want a better job, and I'm definitely not happy and cheery, but... I'm not longer angry and feel like it's all meaningless. It's possible to improve, and change and it's possible to end the spiral of anxiety and depression. The trick, as dumb as it sounds is to first acknowledge the issue, the second is to just do something. You don't have to enjoy it or like it and you might even hate it, but just give yourself 5 minutes to do SOMETHING different, every day.. suddenly the sky seems less grey.

The estimate assumed that social distancing was maintained through the end of April. https://www.forbes.com/sites/joshuacohen/2020/04/02/accuracy-of-estimate-of-100000-to-240000-covid-19-deaths-hinges-on-key-assumptions/#322c528a144e

The IHME model is where 69k deaths comes from. Unlike the previous estimate, it assumes social distancing is maintained all the way through May. It's also only an estimate of the total deaths through August 1st, so it's ignoring the possibility of multiple waves of infection after that, so it's not really an estimate of total deaths. The purpose of the model is to predict when the current wave of infections will peak, so our leaders know when to prepare for the worst and how bad it will be. You can see the latest iteration of the IHME model here. https://covid19.healthdata.org/united-states-of-america

You're right though in that the IHME model's estimate of total deaths has gone up and down, but mostly down (though it might go up soon, see my edit at the bottom). The earliest version of the model that I know of estimated 93k deaths through August 1st. The fluctuating estimates aren't because they found a problem with the model, but rather that they've updated it with new data as more information has become available, as you said. There's a nice graph here of how the IHME estimates have changed over time. https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2020/04/14/how-mortality-predictions-leading-coronavirus-model-dropped-over-time/#comments-wrapper

There are also state-level models, most of which have been less optimistic than the IHME model. https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2020/04/06/americas-most-influential-coronavirus-model-just-revised-its-estimates-downward-not-every-model-agrees/

EDIT: If you look at the latest IHME model, last updated on April 13th, it said that we would have 1,888 deaths today, but we've actually had a whopping 4,600 deaths today. I would expect the IHME estimate to be revised upwards in the next few days. https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2020/national/coronavirus-us-cases-deaths/"

In sintesi nel genoma virale non vi è traccia di sequenze artificiali, ma soprattutto in alcune specie di pipistrelli è stato riscontrato un virus compatibile al 96% con il SARS-CoV-2. L'unica differenza sostanziale riguarda le proteine ""spike"" che legano i recettori cellulari di esseri umani e certi felini con particolare efficacia: sono meno funzionali nel ceppo diffuso tra i pipistrelli. 
Cosa significa? Che probabilmente il virus si è diffuso tra gli uomini grazie ad una mutazione casuale (e conseguente selezione naturale) che potrebbe essere avvenuta nella fase prezoonotica o postzoonotica, cioè, o in una specie animale serbatoio/amplificatore o in qualche individuo umano già infetto. 
Tutto questo diventa ancora più plausibile se consideriamo che il virus responsabile della SARS aveva come serbatoio i pipistrelli e come amplificatore gli *zibetti*, animali d'allevamento, entrambi fan parte della famiglia coronaviridae e presentano molte somiglianze.

Anche sul [sito](https://www.who.int/news-room/q-a-detail/q-a-coronaviruses) dell'OMS questa sembrerebbe la teoria più accreditata (alla voce ""is the source of the coronavirus causing COVID-19 known?"")

He mainly just gave the same thing to anyone who  claimed to have had shortness of breath, or was in the ""high-risk""  category for COVID-19, so it's likely a lot of those people never had the virus in the first place.

Notice how every almost every country experienced a peak, then a big drop.  It should be noted this is the case in Sweden too, except the mortality never went outside of the 'normal' range, so Sweden has essentially experienced zero excess mortality.  Despite countries enacting lockdown at different times, every country that did experience a 'peak' in mortality, experienced it last week.  Where excess mortality has happened, it is largely inline with the severe 2017 flu season.  This basically shows that there is very little excess mortality happening, certainly not anything that should be treated as an 'extraordinary' threat.  Another thing to note is that it looks like, compared to previous seasons, the flu season was very mild this year (notice there is very little 'spike' in the winter for 2019/20 compared to the previous years in the age bracket charts, when compared to the last 3 years flu seasons), so really the excess deaths happening now, are deaths that would of usually occured during the winter, except we appear to have had an exceptionally mild flu season this year in Europe.  This has probably left many of the weakest and most vulnerable alive who would normally have died, who have now succumbed to CV19.  This is shown well in the death statistics for CV19 that we have seen, with median age of death in most countries around 80.

We also need to note that some of this excess mortality, in countries who enacted draconian lockdowns, could well have been caused by the lockdown itself when combined with hysterical panic reactions, with elderly care becoming difficult due to mass exodus of eastern European nurses that many western European countries rely on \[1\].  Given this and Sweden's experience with the virus, we can certainly see how logically some of the excess mortality could well be down to the lockdown measures themselves causing extra deaths.

\[1\] In German, use a translate: [https://www.sueddeutsche.de/politik/coronavirus-pflegekraefte-ausland-1.4866124](https://www.sueddeutsche.de/politik/coronavirus-pflegekraefte-ausland-1.4866124)

\[2\] Quote from anonymous Italian doctor on the situation in Italy:

„In recent weeks, most of the Eastern European nurses who worked 24 hours a day, 7 days a week supporting people in need of care in Italy have left the country in a hurry. This is not least because of the panic-mongering and the curfews and border closures threatened by the „emergency governments“. As a result, old people in need of care and disabled people, some without relatives, were left helpless by their carers.

Many of these abandoned people then ended up after a few days in the hospitals, which had been permanently overloaded for years, because they were dehydrated, among other things. Unfortunately, the hospitals lacked the personnel who had to look after the children locked up in their apartments because schools and kindergartens had been closed. This then led to the complete collapse of the care for the disabled and the elderly, especially in those areas where even harder „measures“ were ordered, and to chaotic conditions.

The nursing emergency, which was caused by the panic, temporarily led to many deaths among those in need of care and increasingly among younger patients in the hospitals. These fatalities then served to cause even more panic among those in charge and the media, who reported, for example, „another 475 fatalities“, „The dead are being removed from hospitals by the army“, accompanied by pictures of coffins and army trucks lined up.

However, this was the result of the funeral directors‘ fear of the „killer virus“, who therefore refused their services. Moreover, on the one hand there were too many deaths at once and on the other hand the government passed a law that the corpses carrying the coronavirus had to be cremated. In Catholic Italy, few cremations had been carried out in the past. Therefore there were only a few small crematoria, which very quickly reached their limits. Therefore the deceased had to be laid out in different churches.

In principle, this development is the same in all countries. However, the quality of the health system has a considerable influence on the effects. Therefore, there are fewer problems in Germany, Austria or Switzerland than in Italy, Spain or the USA. However, as can be seen in the official figures, there is no significant increase in the mortality rate. Just a small mountain that came from this tragedy.“"

A 99-year-old war veteran has walked 100 laps of his garden to raise £14m and counting for the NHS.

Captain Tom Moore originally wanted to raise £1,000 for NHS Charities Together by completing laps of his garden before his 100th birthday.

But he smashed his target after more than 700,000 people made donations to his fundraising page.

As he finished the challenge, he said: ""I feel fine, I hope you're all feeling fine too.""

Capt Tom told the BBC earlier that the total amount raised so far was ""an absolutely fantastic sum of money"".

""I never dreamt I would be involved in such an occasion as this,"" he said at the end of his final lap.

Just before 15:00 BST, Capt Tom's JustGiving page, which temporarily crashed shortly after he finished the challenge, was showing donations of more than £14m.

His daughter Hannah Ingram-Moore said: ""We are absolutely floored by what has been achieved but we're so happy, so humbled and so proud.

""He's a beacon of hope in dark times and I think we all need something like this to believe in and it's for such an amazing cause.""

His granddaughter, Georgia, added she was ""very proud"" of him.

Capt Tom began raising funds to thank the ""magnificent"" NHS staff who helped him with treatment for cancer and a broken hip.

With the aid of a walking frame, he completed 100 laps of the 25-metre (82ft) loop in his garden in Marston Moretaine, Bedfordshire, in 10-lap chunks well before his birthday on 30 April.

Tributes and messages of congratulations have poured in from politicians, celebrities and NHS workers.

A spokesman for Prime Minister Boris Johnson said Capt Tom had ""captured the heart of the nation with his heroic efforts"" and raised an ""incredible amount"" of money.

Chancellor Rishi Sunak said what he had done was ""extraordinary"" and ""showed that the British spirit was as strong as it's ever been"", while Brig Andrew Jackson, colonel of the Yorkshire Regiment, described Capt Tom as ""an absolute legend"" who came from ""an exceptional generation that are still an inspiration for our Yorkshire soldiers today"".

Celebrity judge Judy Sheindlin described the 99-year-old as ""remarkable"" while former F1 champion Damon Hill congratulated him on the ""brilliant idea and for pulling it off"".

Nurses on Ward 4 at the Royal University Hospital said: ""Thank you so much for all your efforts and how much money you've raised for the NHS.""

Capt Tom also received a special message from actor and singer Michael Ball, who described the challenge as ""an extraordinary achievement"" and sang ""You'll Never Walk Alone"" to him live on BBC Breakfast.

Shortly after he finished the fundraiser, the retired soldier had words of advice for the nation about coping with the coronavirus lockdown.

""You've all got to remember that we will get through it in the end, it will all be right,"" he said.

""For all those people finding it difficult at the moment, the sun will shine on you again and the clouds will go away.""

More than 700,000 people from around the world have donated money to the fundraising page since it was set up last week.

Capt Tom, who is originally from Keighley in West Yorkshire, trained as a civil engineer before enlisting in the Army for World War Two, rising to captain and serving in India and Myanmar, also known as Burma.

Calls for him to receive a knighthood have gathered momentum and a petition has been signed by more than 200,000 people so far.

Downing Street said Mr Johnson will ""certainly be looking at ways to recognise"" him.

""It would be marvellous to have such an honour but I don't expect anything like that,"" Capt Tom said.

The veteran said plans for his 100th birthday party in two weeks' time have been affected by the pandemic but that the national outpouring of love and support for him was ""a party enough for me"".

""I think there will be thousands but I will make room for Capt Tom's birthday cards somehow, that should be no problem.

""He is a regular visitor and has always got time and patience, he's a real gentleman.""

NHS Charities Together, which support health service charities and will benefit from the funds, said it was ""truly inspired and humbled"" by his efforts.

Chairman, Ian Lush, said about 150 charities would benefit from the money.

""It's extraordinary to see the amount of money and the outpouring of goodwill towards the NHS and towards all the NHS charities who will take good care with the money that he's raising,"" he said.

JustGiving confirmed it is the largest total ever raised in a single campaign on its site and it had itself donated £100,000 to Capt Tom's ""amazing campaign"".

""This is the largest donation JustGiving has ever made,"" a spokeswoman said.

""[The campaign is] the largest total raised on JustGiving, the fastest growing campaign on the platform and has attracted donations and media coverage from around the world."""

Uefa are proposing to play the Champions League final on the last Saturday in August as talks over the rescheduling of the end of the European and domestic seasons continue.

The final was due to be played at the Ataturk Stadium in Istanbul on May 30 but it could now be pushed back to Aug. 29 as result of [the coronavirus crisis](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/coronavirus/).

The Europa League final in Gdansk has been provisionally earmarked for Aug 26.

Four Champions League Round of 16 second leg ties have still to be concluded, including Manchester City against Real Madrid at the Etihad Stadium and Chelsea’s trip to Bayern Munich.

But there have been discussions about provisionally playing the quarter-final matches from July 28/29, with the rest of the competition concluded in August.

Europa League ties would, in theory, be played in the same weeks although there are still 10 Round of 16 matches to factor in - two first leg ties and eight second leg games.

Manchester United hold a 5-0 first leg advantage over LASK while Wolverhampton Wanderers face Olympiacos having drawn 1-1 in the first leg in Greece.

Uefa are still open to playing European matches concurrently with domestic games but the strong preference of many clubs at this stage has been to first finish their own league campaigns before turning their attention to Europe. 

Aleksander Ceferin, the Uefa president, has already ruled out the prospect of Champions League and Europa League matches being played in September or October.

But a late August finish to European competition would give clubs as much time as possible to finish their domestic seasons, even if all plans to resume football will be subject to an easing of lockdown restrictions and government advice.

Additionally, Ceferin has said that playing games behind closed doors would be preferable to abandoning matches.

Uefa have also discussed the possibility of squashing the remaining Champions League and Europa League ties so they are played over one leg if necessary and have even proposed the idea of a mini-tournament, where all quarter-final, semi-final and final matches are played over one leg over the course of a week in one location.

But the ideal scenario is for all existing matches to be played. Broadcasters have already paid tens of millions of pounds to televise games and any reduction in matches would, in theory, mean clubs having to reimburse the television companies.

Concluding the remaining games in late July and August would not be without its complications, though. Premier League clubs are already worried about the matter of expiring player and staff contracts.

Fifa has introduced measures that would enable clubs to extend contracts for players whose deals are due to expire on June 30 but legal experts have already warned that this will be impossible to enforce under English employment law without the player’s consent.

Equally, if the Premier League campaign was to conclude before July 1 - which a number of top flight clubs could push for at a shareholders’ meeting on Friday - there would be a significant gap between the end of the domestic campaign and the European matches resuming and finishing."

How long had you looked for work? If you haven't worked, why? If not, do you have a disability?

If you do, apply for SSI once you're in a more stable situation. If you can't work, you're disabled, but for SSI you have to say you're incapable of doing *any* work - if they reject your claim, which they probably will, just keep on appealing it until you get a final hearing, with a lawyer hired to represent you. The sooner you apply, the larger the back payment, if eventually approved.

If not disabled or unable to work, apply for any jobs you might be able to do. Amazon, for instance, is hiring.

I'm a Chinese person from Malaysia. I haven't been to China my entire life, and personally do not like their government either. 

Let me start by telling you a bit about Malaysia. It's a beautiful tropical country with 3 major races; Malays, Chinese & Indians (we have many more ethnicities, but I digress). We also have many natural resources, which is probably why the British brought my (Chinese) ancestors and Indians to my country years ago as labour. Eventually, the British left, and the Chinese and Indian labourers decided to make a home of the country they were brought to. Our independence was fraught with strife and racial tension which even caused the separation of the country into two, Malaysia & Singapore. This racial tension still persists to this day and can be seen by certain extremists who claim that Malaysian Chinese are somehow to blame for this Coronavirus.

I'm afraid now after all this settles, the world will look at all East Asian people with disdain. Like we're the ones who started this virus in the first place. I'm afraid for the safety of East Asian people everywhere, reading news of people who have been beaten or even murdered just because someone thought they were Chinese. Stories have been coming out everywhere from Europe to Africa to the States, and even Japan and Korea. 

I think cases will likely be worse when it all settles. 

I hope common sense prevails throughout all this, and that people recognise that even the people from China were also victims. I hope the world can move on peacefully and work together better to prevent something this unprecedented from happening again. I hope we get through this.

It's probably selfish of me to say this, but I still would love to travel (once all this settles of course) and experience the different cultures of the world. I haven't seen so much, and would love to visit. But I don't know what it's going to be like, and honestly, even looking at my own country, I'm a bit scared."

Broadly, the DP, which was before and remains in power, is centre-left leaning, the UFP centre the right leaning opposition, everything else is a side-show.

South west (mostly Jeolla), and south east (mostly Gyeongsang) Korea dislike each other, a rivalry dating back centuries, and always vote for opposite parties in this way. Regional identity trumps political opinion in basically every way. Jeolla goes DP and Gyeongsang goes UFP no matter what. Even south-eastern Daegu, centre of the first big coronavirus pandemic outside China, did not vote for the government that suppressed it. Regional identity is that important. 

No-one really lives in Gangwon in the north east, but it's rural and conservative. Very few seats, but they go to the UFP. Basically, very little actual competition goes into any of this- outside the north west.

In practice, this means that the north west- Greater Seoul/Gyeonggi- where about half the population live, is the only really genuinely competitive region and decides basically every election. The previous UFP government was embroiled in a political scandal in 2016 when its most recent president, Park Geun-hye, joined a cult and spent her presidency acting  on its orders to corruptly advance its interests, leading to her impeachment and is currently serving 25 years in prison.

I'm here to give it to you because I've seen dumb fucks like you for years come to MRP, think they have it figured out - but think ""Hey, maybe I""m missing something....""

> So... What am I missing??? 

Everything.  Absolutely fucking everything.

> I've dabbled in MRP and worked my butt off

So, you've *dabbled.*  Or is it that you've worked your butt off?  Which one is it, faggot?  I'm going to guess the first.  

>.... to get in the best shape of my life.   
>  
> 6ft, 175lbs. I've been doing calisthenics since the coronavirus but I'm above my body weight on all the big lifts. 

I was right!  You did just dabble.  Your lifts suck.  You took your little micro-penis and dabbled it into the warm sea of [Alex J Anderson's ego](https://www.reddit.com/r/marriedredpill/comments/emf8hv/i_need_to_improve_my_sex_life_with_my_wife_were/) where the pussy flows free, you look like a great athlete and play wonderwall on your guitar until the sweet pussy juice is free.  *You're hot shit.*

But you know the reality man?  You aren't.  I'm 6ft - and when at 150lbs looking like a jacked meth-head my lifts were all *much* bigger than yours.  Your lifts suck.  You have half-assed being a man.  You know it.  Don't you?

But why do you tell yourself this lie?

> We just went on vacation and I was one of the best looking guys at the resort.

> On my last few business trips I wound up in another woman's bed that I had just met. Blocked by ASD but fooled around quite a bit. And the other trip I would have scored had she not had her fat cockblock friend urging her to not join me for dancing.  

Just because you were at a resort where there were likely a lot of fat people doesn't make you attractive.  You are a dancing monkey who derives his own self-worth from women.  You are a classic validation seeking faggot.  You took time to make sure we knew you were good looking, and that speaks volumes of your ego.

Inside you're secretly afraid that you aren't attractive and that bleeds through everything you do and say to make you incongruent to your actions that your wife sees.  

You're a classic LARPing alpha faggot.

> I am now CEO of a company with 20 employees. This company is going through growing pains, 

Hey Mr. Ego, do I see you peeking around the corner again?  Growing pains?  I bet you complain to this in your home and your wife hears it.

> She is convinced the business will fails. She is convinced I will squander and lose my ample nest egg. 

Yep, I bet you do complain.  Or at the very least take the stress you have from it home with you and she *feelz* through this and doubts you.

Of course she does this.  You're an egomaniac LARPing faggot that tells himself lies to make himself feel better.

Like being the best looking.  Or your lifts are great.  Or you're a CEO.  Or you have 20 employees.  Or the COUNTLESS and FUCKING POINTLESS little details you throw into this post to make *damned sure* we all know you're hot fucking shit with a 12 inch cock that any woman would be happy to have.

Except... the one woman you deeply desire wants it doesn't.  Because she can read through your bullshit even when you can't.  She sees the real you, and there is no fucking way she's going to give up the helm to a faggot captain.

> About her: stubborn and serious with very high standards for herself and others. Jacktenofhearts had some great writings on dealing with this type of woman but I've struggled to understand what he was saying, I wish he were here to ask.  

Jackten wrote about this when men had figured shit out, dropped ego, **done the actual fucking work,** and *then* were left with a woman who didn't want to give up control.  You aren't any where near this.  You can't even been authentic with yourself.

> She's very critical of me, of herself, and worst of all... Of the children. In these cases I've had to step in and tell her it is unacceptable and I refuse to let her speak to my kids that way. 

I get it, she has pretty high standards and is anxious.  Part of that pre-dates you, but I'm going to take a wild fucking guess here and a shot in the fucking dark and say you've made her this anxious ball of mess and.... *it's all your fault.*

I must have one of the most anxious wives on this fucking planet, but you know what?  All she probably needed was a man worth a shit and one that is capable of sailing the ship and wasn't lying to himself about his worth or abilities.

You have no outcome independence and guise wanting to be with your wife as ""for the kids"".  It's bullshit.  Secretly, you like the challenge.  Not necessarily bad for now.  But she's up on the pedestal and you know it.

....

So my advice?

Same I give to every faggot here.

>The European Central Bank’s decision to buy almost €900bn of extra bonds this year has kept sovereign yields under control and helped stave off a rerun of the 2010-2012 eurozone debt crisis.  
>  
>But as new IMF forecasts on Wednesday showed, the coronavirus crisis is propelling government debt in the single currency area towards 100 per cent of gross domestic product. Central bankers and economists warned that debt burdens could still stifle the growth prospects of a range of fiscally weaker member states, straining the economic cohesion of the eurozone.  
>  
>Yannis Stournaras, governor of the Bank of Greece, said his country’s experience during the last crisis showed how important it will be to keep growth afloat during the dark period ahead. The package of fiscal measures proposed by the eurogroup of eurozone finance ministers last week had, he warned, failed to go far enough.  
>  
>“Keeping the difference between the growth rate and interest rate at a positive level — that is critical. We have to minimise this snowball effect that we saw in the Greek crisis,” said Mr Stournaras, who was Greece’s finance minister before taking over as head of the country’s central bank in 2014. “Whether you call it ‘coronabonds’ or something else, what we need is joint action.”  
>  
>The IMF predicted euro area gross public debt will rise by around €800bn from 2019 to 2020, leaving it at 97.4 per cent of GDP, well above levels reached during the sovereign debt crisis. After Greece, Italy will have the highest debt burden this year among euro area countries, topping 155 per cent. But a number of other states including France, Spain and Portugal will have debt piles exceeding 100 per cent of GDP, the IMF’s Fiscal Monitor shows.  
>  
>Vitor Gaspar, director of the fiscal affairs department at the IMF, said the numbers seen in countries such as Spain and Italy were appropriate given governments’ need to support their economies during the crisis, and that the increases in debt were in line with other parts of the world. And with interest rates low, debt-to-GDP ratios should stabilise in Spain and come down in Italy the following year, he said.  
>  
>“Lots of surprises have happened in the past few weeks, but it does look like the euro area is substantially more robust than it was in the previous episodes,” Mr Gaspar said. “The financing and macroeconomic conditions should be more favourable for countries’ ability to finance higher levels of debt than in the past.”  
>  
>However, many economists worry that the current crisis will bear far more heavily on fiscally stretched countries, especially in the south, as heavy debt loads constrain their ability to invest in a robust recovery. The current shock may be “symmetric,” said Lorenzo Codogno of LC Macro Advisors, “but the policy response might be asymmetric because of the different fiscal space in different countries.”  
>  
>If Europe ends up in a situation where some countries are constrained in policy responses and growth performances diverge, he said, “it would produce economic and social and political strains”.  
>  
>The Italian economy, for instance, has stagnated for more than a decade and it was already the weakest performer in the eurozone when the coronavirus crisis hit, having shrunk 0.3 per cent in the final three months of last year — its biggest quarterly fall for almost seven years.  
>  
>TS Lombard, the research group, calculated that Italian government debt would increase to 218 per cent of GDP by 2025 and Spanish government debt would rise to 137 per cent, even if their financing costs remained at their current low levels.  
>  
>A sell-off in Italy’s government debt this week has pushed the country’s 10-year yield to a four-week high of over 1.8 per cent. That reversed more than half of the reduction in the spread between Italian and German long-term borrowing costs since the ECB announced its extra €750bn bond-buying plan.  
>  
>Mohamed El-Erian, chief economic adviser at Allianz, said that, like other parts of the world, Europe will leave the shutdown with higher debt and lower growth potential.  
>  
>“Absent some form of subsidised support from the ECB or, preferably, subsidised financing from the more resilient countries, this will add to the longer-term debt sustainability challenges facing some of the more vulnerable economies,” he said, “thereby adding to both growth and financial stability risks.”  
>  
>The risks of a serious loss of investor confidence in euro area governments are being minimised thanks in significant part to the ECB’s action. Italian bonds, for example, made up over a third of the €34bn in sovereign debt bought by the ECB last month, as it waded into government debt markets to reverse a sudden spike in borrowing costs.  
>  
>The central bank also bought higher-than-usual levels of French and Spanish government bonds in response to rising yields on the debt of those countries. The cost of borrowing for several peripheral eurozone members rose sharply last month after ECB president Christine Lagarde’s comment that it was not the central bank’s job to “close the spread” in bond markets. She later withdrew the remark.  
>  
>“We \[the ECB\] are not going to permit a fragmentation of the financial markets, we are not going to permit rises in risk premia that are not based on fundamentals,” said Pablo Hernández de Cos, governor of the Bank of Spain. “As debt levels rise, it is all the more important that countries grow; and to raise growth prospects, reforms to boost productivity and employment are essential.”  
>  
>Investors are closely watching an EU summit call next week in which leaders will consider jointly funded measures aimed at supporting the bloc’s recovery once the lockdowns end. The eurogroup has already supported measures worth over €500bn aimed at immediate crisis support, but the focus will be on a recovery fund that would help weaker states invest in the rebound.  
>  
>“The decision makers in Europe have shown a willingness to act under a crisis — and that is the case this time as well,” said Mr Gaspar. “The package of measures from the eurogroup last week is certainly a start.”"

Here is James Corbett's viral 9/11 video:

- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuC_4mGTs98

And **here is the current manifesto - transcribed for your convenient review and sharing:**

===========================

hello james corbett of corbettreport.com  

reporting to you from the socially  closed streets of western japan 

in  Walden henry david thoreau famously  observed that there are a thousand  hacking at the branches of evil to one  striking at its root 

and there can be no  doubt that there are many thousands that  are hacking away at the branches of the  evil that we see spreading out before us  in the name of this pandemic panic  -- diligently deconstructing the  dissembling discourse of the disease  doomsayers and rightfully so i count  myself amongst them 

however if all we  are doing is smacking down the lies that  are being spread about this pandemic as  soon as they arise then we run the risk  of missing that root of the evil  altogether so allow me if you will to  take one hefty swipe at that root with  my battle axe of truth by clearly  stating and rejecting the new governing  principle for society that we are being  asked to accept on the basis of this  pandemic pandemonium.

now this new  governing principle for society of  course is implicit I mean we're going to  sign on to it by our silent consent not  our explicit consent but nonetheless it  rests on a hypothetical 

a hypothetical  chain of infection that can take place  in the event of a spreading infectious  agent 

now keep in mind this has nothing  to do with a novel coronavirus [COVID19]  of - this is about a general principle  but the principle holds that if there is  a spreading infectious agent of some  sort that is hypothetically infecting  people around the globe and you might  become infected by this agent 

and you  might end up passing it on to someone  else 

who might end up passing it on to  someone else etc etc 

and somewhere down  that chain of infection someone who is  immunocompromised might end up becoming  infected 

and they might be part of that  of a fraction of a percentage point of  the population 

who might die from the  disease 

and if that were to take place  well of course every single link in that  chain of infection should be classified  as a murderer 

and in order to prevent  such a mass murder from taking place  governments around the world are not  just empowered but actually obligated to  implement a sort of de facto medical  martial law by following the  pronouncements of the duly unelected  health authorities to do whatever they  deem necessary to prevent such a  hypothetical chain of infection from  taking place -- up to and including:

quarantine people within the walls of  their own homes 
  
and or entering those  walls to forcibly remove people from  their own homes 
  
>>and at the moment in  most parts of the world do to lock down  most of the transmission that's actually  happening in many countries now is  happening in the household at family  level in some senses transmission has  been taken off the streets and pushed  back into family units now we need to go  and look in families to find those  people who may be sick and remove them  and isolate them in a safe and dignified  manner

we are being asked to accept this  abrogation of our most precious freedoms  including 

• our freedom to travel 

• our  freedom of association assembly 

• our  freedom from arbitrary detention within  the walls of our own home 

• our freedom of  privacy in transaction and interaction  

• and other hard-fought freedoms that were  purchased at the price of our  forefathers blood 

on the basis of a  novel coronavirus that is presenting  presenting a novel existential threat to  humanity that has never before existed  

BUT THAT OF COURSE IS A LIE

because  every single flu season for your entire  life there have been such hypothetical  chains of infection that have taken  place 

and I have no doubt let's put it  on the table I have no doubt that there  is someone listening to my words right  now  who has been involved in some chain of  infection that has ended up in  some immunocompromised person dying  

never before has that person had to  think of themselves as a murderer 

let  alone lock themselves within the  confines of their own home to prevent  such a murder from ever taking place  again 

but that is what we are being  asked to accept right now and I want  this out on the table 

BECAUSE IF WE DO  NOT CLEARLY ARTICULATE THIS PRINCIPLE -- that we're being asked to accept then by our silence we will can consent to it  we will tacitly implicitly consent to  what is taking place right now 

AND I  WANT TO CLEARLY STATE IT 

AND CLEARLY  REJECT IT

Also, please allow me to add **some additional inspired words from Amazing Polly's recent post:**

=================================

bottom line 

systems aren't bad 

it's the people inside the systems that are bad 

and when I said earlier we're gonna have to do some things that are not good 

one of the things we're gonna have to get really good at that seems on the surface to be a bad thing is extricated liars and huxter's out of our midst 

we have to do it we have to stop giving people so much benefit of the doubt 

a little benefit of that sure 

we need our we need to use discernment 

we need to remember what it's like to discriminate 

we need to be able to tell who is operating from integrity 

and who isn't 

people don't have to be perfect 

that's not what I'm saying 

but look we overlooked way too much and it's it's the good people's job to sort of point out and push away those who would sell out those who would give up their values for fame or ego or money or any of it 

we have to 

that's our job

As we now know, their letter was not a warning, it was a request for more information. It didn't say anything about human-to-human transmission. Even so, it didn't stop Taiwan from saying for months that it did."

When he was the Health Minister of Ethiopia, he kept very close ties with China. When he was just a candidate for Director General, China completely funded him.

Taiwan, despite having a population density 20x higher than the US, has managed to cap off their coronavirus cases below 400 *to this day* due to exemplary medical practices, but he rejected Taiwan's requests to participate in the W.H.O. because it'd offend China.

If you mean NATO, it's done very little but endanger American interests around the world. It's being used as a suicide pact firewall in order to stop Russian advancement, which was the communist powerhouse thirty years ago. The world has changed. I'll tell you my perspective on Russia in a minute. But if NATO is really there to stop communism, you'd think it would create a suicide pact firewall around China (Taiwan, whatever,) but instead it's mucking around in Ukraine, Syria, and so on. 

If you mean the UN, that organization has shown its true colors in this coronavirus mess. It hasn't helped anyone, anywhere. The WHO, their healthcare arm, has proven itself to be completely bought out by the CCP. 

Nah, these international institutions needed a shakeup. Trump has been delivering.

> Ultimately, I believe we've lost our international credibility under Trump's leadership, and there is no longer a pax-Americana to return to. 

If you can point to some specific, I'm happy to entertain it. But Trump ""giving the finger"" to the rest of the world has mostly consisted of empty threats and asking for other countries to pay into military alliances. What treaties have been broken? What conflicts have broken out because Trump put pressure on our allies? What is the actual problem? Again, happy to hear what the problem is if you can point to actual issues. The problems, pre corona, weren't economic. Most of the whining has been about the Paris Accord, which was dumb as hell.

Putting pressure on our allies is not a weakness. If they are our allies, they will work with us on minor things, like funding a military alliance. 

Let's turn back the clock for a minute. Under the previous administrations, the US was involved in pointless wars across the planet. Every year American strength and money was being siphoned into middle eastern conflicts that were apparently being used to offset Russia. 

Except it made no sense. Despite what you think, Russia is not a global power. Their population is not even equivalent to France and Germany combined. The Eurozone as a whole is growing in population and has the equivalent of our population and economic numbers. That's what counts. In fact, Russia's population is aging, as is their infrastructure. They have nukes, sure, but so do plenty of other countries. Their real military advancements have been in artillery, IIRC, but that's about it. About the only force projection they used was in Syria, which was a war Obama got involved in and gave us absolutely nothing. 

China is the true threat. It's a threat that every administration in the past 30 years has ignored. Trump has been forcing allies to look at the actual threat instead of fighting a 30 year old war against an aged foe."

Misconceptions about them are now firmly embedded in the national and police consciousness.
We have recently seen wrongful convictions under the Coronavirus Act, which applies only to those suspected of carrying the infection, and excessive and erroneous “enforcement” of children playing in their own front garden and of a young man cuffed for helping his mother.
Drones fly over parks, the Peak District and even back gardens. One chief constable tweeted that he might soon be directing his officers to rifle through shopping trolleys to check items.
The regulations that we are all now subject to — the Health Protection (Coronavirus, Restrictions) (England) Regulations 2020 — were brought into force by statutory instrument on March 26. They provide the police with unprecedented powers, but imprecision in relation to the nature of the restrictions has led to confusion and inconsistent enforcement. Lord Sumption, the former Supreme Court judge, has warned of a drift towards a police state as the government’s preferences are enforced rather than the law.
In relation to exercise the advice has consistently been that we must only take one form of exercise a day, close to home and limited to an hour.
The regulations, however, do not impose any such limit in terms of frequency, duration or location, simply stating that to take exercise is a reasonable excuse to leave home. There is no prohibition on driving to a place for exercise; for many, doing so is likely to provide greater safety from the virus than the immediate vicinity.
Similarly, there is no express restriction on the number of times we may shop for basic necessities each day or a definition of qualifying items. Are ingredients to bake a cake “necessities”? There has been controversy over Easter eggs, but not other forms of chocolate.
The regulations also allow us to shop for vulnerable persons not in the same household. No limit is written into the rules on the distance we may travel to do this. And no exhaustive list of what constitutes “vulnerable” is provided, though some examples are given.
Any breach of these imprecise rules constitutes a criminal offence. If a police officer merely “considers” a person to be in breach that officer can direct the person to go home and, if necessary, use “reasonable” force to ensure that direction is obeyed.
This departure from the legal norm that objectively reasonable grounds must exist radically resets the relationship between citizen and state. Even if people have done nothing wrong, they may be fined or arrested.
Our wellbeing is taking an unprecedented battering as the normal autonomy and structure of our lives has been hugely circumscribed. Fresh air and daily exercise, particularly for children with no outside space, is essential and permitted.
A visit to the shop to buy necessities is likely for many to be a high point of the day. People should not be put in fear about these simple actions.”

**A German medical lawyer who criticized the coronavirus lockdown law was arrested and taken to a psychiatric ward, where she says she was violently abused by authorities.**

Beate Bahner published a press release on April 3rd decrying the German lockdown laws as “flagrantly unconstitutional, infringing to an unprecedented extent many of the fundamental rights of citizens.”

    
**“These measures are not justified by the Infection Prevention Act, hurriedly amended just a few days ago**,” she asserted.

    
""Long-term restrictions on leaving home and meeting others, based on high-death-rate modelled scenarios, which fail to take account of actual critical expert opinions, and the complete shutdown of businesses and shops with no proof that they pose any risk of infection, are thoroughly unlawful.”

Bahner called for a nationwide protest on Easter Sunday to “end the tyranny at once,” before Heidelberg Police announced that they would seek to prosecute her for inciting Germans to break the law.

On April 13th, Bahner called her sister from Heidelberg’s Klinik fur Allgemeine Psychiatrie describing what happened to her.

After claiming she was “suspiciously” followed by a car, Bahner says she asked another motorist to call the police only for the police to show up, handcuff her and push her to the ground “with massive force.”

After being driven to the psychiatric facility, Bahner says she was treated like a terrorist.

“I asked to be allowed to sit down and was shown to a bench. Then I asked to have the handcuffs taken off, since it was actually I who had requested police protection,” she recounted.

    
“But instead, I was thrown to the floor again, having my head hurled onto the stone floor from a meter height, which nobody reacted to. Then I was forced to spend the night lying on the floor in some high-security Guantanamo psychiatric clinic…there was no toilet, no sink, though they did allow me water, and there was a bell I could ring, though they ignored it after the third time I pressed it.”

The lawyer was charged for incitement yesterday, with her attorney sounding the alarm bell over her treatment.


“I shouldn’t have to add Bahner’s claims of very grave abuse have untoward connotations of the darkest chapters of German history,” he said.

    
“The mere fact she claimed to have been so badly abused was what prompted me to write to you. **Bahner is in the company of over 50 well-known experts in criticising the nationwide lockdown**; I would be glad to furnish you with a list of their names. If it really is the case lawyers critical of government measures can now be intimidated using the state legal apparatus or psychiatry, and can be professionally and socially destroyed, then it is five minutes to midnight in this country.”

Bahner has won three cases in the Federal Constitutional Court and written five books on German medical law."

*By Sylvia Westall and Layan Odeh*

*April 16, 2020, 7:00 AM GMT+4*

* The U.A.E. imports as much as 90% of the food it consumes
* Efforts have echoes of the global food crisis that began 2007

Around the world the coronavirus pandemic has brutally exposed economic vulnerabilities. For wealthy but parched states in the Gulf it’s resurrecting deep concerns over food.

Supermarket shelves are still well stocked, if missing some fresh cheeses or imported seafood. But as the virus disrupts global supply chains, desert nations like the United Arab Emirates that import as much as 90% of the food their largely expatriate populations consume are treating the issue as a matter of national security.

As the virus took hold, U.A.E. officials eased import regulations, including requirements for Arabic labeling and extended best-before periods, lowered duties and crammed extra cargoes onto flights intended to repatriate citizens. Measures companies had requested for years were pushed through quickly. The nation’s Food Security Council, formed in February, found itself in crisis mode and the government quickly announced it would bolster strategic stocks.

The potential for supply disruptions are stirring memories of the global food crisis that began in 2007, when the Gulf found that vast financial reserves built from oil sales didn’t always guarantee access to food supplies as producing nations imposed export restrictions to protect their own people from surging prices. Some of the supplies now are coming from investments made by the U.A.E. in Eastern Europe and East Africa farmland after the last crisis.

“Countries in the Gulf learned a lot from that experience,” said Eckart Woertz, director of the Giga Institute of Middle East Studies in Hamburg, who specializes in energy and food security. “It spooked them, and rightly so.”

**Market Exposure**

Even with the measures, Gulf states are more exposed to the whims of markets at a time of massive dislocation. The U.S. imports 15% of its total food, according to the website of the Food and Drug Administration, while the U.K. brings in nearly half.

The U.A.E. has reported nearly 5,000 Covid-19 cases and 28 deaths, imposing stringent restrictions on movement to stop the virus from spreading as it, along with the rest of the Muslim world, prepares for the holy month of Ramadan that begins next week. Mosques are expected to remain off limits for prayers as authorities try to stem transmission; but food consumption typically rises in Ramadan as people prepare big family meals and deserts to break the daily fast.

Migrant blue-collar workers mostly from Southeast Asia who toil in the U.A.E.’s construction and service sectors would be the most vulnerable to price swings or shortages, with many having lost their jobs or been placed on unpaid leave as the virus savages the economy. The local administration in Abu Dhabi, one of the country’s seven sheikhdoms, has pledged to expand a safety-net fund for the hardest hit.

**Heading Home?**

Authorities also have to appease legions of affluent expatriates who could head home if denied the high standard of living they expect, said an Abu Dhabi-based diplomat who’s been tracking the government response. Officials are worried that the prospect of dimmed job opportunities and the sweltering summer coinciding with the expected virus peak could help spur an exodus.

The Dubai office of BRF Global, Brazil’s largest poultry exporter, said it decided a month ago to increase its stocks in the region, predicting more people would stay in the Gulf after Ramadan because of travel restrictions and virus outbreaks back home. To help with a reported storage crunch, four major food retailers including French retail giant Carrefour agreed to provide suppliers with free space for two months to help keep prices down, the government said.

Potatoes, tomatoes, cucumbers and herbs are already grown in the U.A.E. and there’s some meat, egg and dairy production, and even local oysters. But there’s likely to be a renewed focus on expanding cultivation once the virus crisis has passed.

The Abu Dhabi Investment Office said this month it had invested $100 million to encourage four agricultural technology firms to build research and development facilities in the emirate. U.S-based AeroFarms said it wants to construct the biggest vertical farm of its kind in the world -- in which crops are grown in layers -- with the first harvest by mid-2021.

Policy makers are “likely to double-down on tech-based solutions following the end of the crisis,” said Daniel Moshashai, geopolitics and infrastructure analyst for the Middle East at Castlereagh Associates, a London-based consultancy. “Technology will help in the much-needed localization, including for food production.”

There’s plenty to digest from him, from the cases against 1989’s generation to the suicidal girls of the 2006 generation, to even discussing these early Coronavirus vaccine tests in Seattle presently. And this is on top of vaccine companies being given immunity to lawsuits and not being held to the same investigative research as other drugs, which we learned is a dog and pony show anyway because of his mention of the CDC budget and where it comes from totaling almost 50%. 

If everything Kennedy said is with merit, that’s heavy handed news for anyone to try and take on at once. Amazing to hear the relationship between Gates and the Clintons and the funding of these research groups and pharmaceutical companies. I’d read in the past about forced vaccinations in Africa by the U.S. making some sick, killing them, and not at all helping with HIV. I didn’t know how far up the top it went.

Dr Li Wenliang, an optometrist, only told his small group of friends on WeChat that he think there are cases of SARS virus going around and told them to be careful, keep it quiet and not tell anyone.

&#x200b;

However, another doctor you haven't heard about from western media is Dr Zhang Jixian. Dr Zhang was the one who actually first spotted and diagnosed COVID19 and immediately raised the alarm through proper channels (before Dr Li sent his private messages to his buddies) which resulted in China's CDC started its investigation. Dr Zhang awarded in China for doing her job and doing it well.  Dr Zhang Jixian is heroine in this virus war.

&#x200b;

Also, Dr Li wasn't arrested or disappeared, as said by some western media earlier. He was detained, questioned and released in January 3rd, 2020 which is days after China informed WHO of the virus on December 31, 2019. Afterward, the Supreme Court of China exonerated him.  But Dr Li didn't whistle-blow anything.

The U.A.E. imports as much as 90% of the food it consumes
Efforts have echoes of the global food crisis that began 2007

Around the world the coronavirus pandemic has brutally exposed economic vulnerabilities. For wealthy but parched states in the Gulf it’s resurrecting deep concerns over food.

Supermarket shelves are still well stocked, if missing some fresh cheeses or imported seafood. But as the virus disrupts global supply chains, desert nations like the United Arab Emirates that import as much as 90% of the food their largely expatriate populations consume are treating the issue as a matter of national security.

As the virus took hold, U.A.E. officials eased import regulations, including requirements for Arabic labeling and extended best-before periods, lowered duties and crammed extra cargoes onto flights intended to repatriate citizens. Measures companies had requested for years were pushed through quickly. The nation’s Food Security Council, formed in February, found itself in crisis mode and the government quickly announced it would bolster strategic stocks.


The potential for supply disruptions are stirring memories of the global food crisis that began in 2007, when the Gulf found that vast financial reserves built from oil sales didn’t always guarantee access to food supplies as producing nations imposed export restrictions to protect their own people from surging prices. Some of the supplies now are coming from investments made by the U.A.E. in Eastern Europe and East Africa farmland after the last crisis.


“Countries in the Gulf learned a lot from that experience,” said Eckart Woertz, director of the Giga Institute of Middle East Studies in Hamburg, who specializes in energy and food security. “It spooked them, and rightly so.”

Market Exposure

Even with the measures, Gulf states are more exposed to the whims of markets at a time of massive dislocation. The U.S. imports 15% of its total food, according to the website of the Food and Drug Administration, while the U.K. brings in nearly half.

The U.A.E. has reported nearly 5,000 Covid-19 cases and 28 deaths, imposing stringent restrictions on movement to stop the virus from spreading as it, along with the rest of the Muslim world, prepares for the holy month of Ramadan that begins next week. Mosques are expected to remain off limits for prayers as authorities try to stem transmission; but food consumption typically rises in Ramadan as people prepare big family meals and deserts to break the daily fast.

Migrant blue-collar workers mostly from Southeast Asia who toil in the U.A.E.’s construction and service sectors would be the most vulnerable to price swings or shortages, with many having lost their jobs or been placed on unpaid leave as the virus savages the economy. The local administration in Abu Dhabi, one of the country’s seven sheikhdoms, has pledged to expand a safety-net fund for the hardest hit.

Heading Home?

Authorities also have to appease legions of affluent expatriates who could head home if denied the high standard of living they expect, said an Abu Dhabi-based diplomat who’s been tracking the government response. Officials are worried that the prospect of dimmed job opportunities and the sweltering summer coinciding with the expected virus peak could help spur an exodus.

The Dubai office of BRF Global, Brazil’s largest poultry exporter, said it decided a month ago to increase its stocks in the region, predicting more people would stay in the Gulf after Ramadan because of travel restrictions and virus outbreaks back home. To help with a reported storage crunch, four major food retailers including French retail giant Carrefour agreed to provide suppliers with free space for two months to help keep prices down, the government said.


Potatoes, tomatoes, cucumbers and herbs are already grown in the U.A.E. and there’s some meat, egg and dairy production, and even local oysters. But there’s likely to be a renewed focus on expanding cultivation once the virus crisis has passed.

The Abu Dhabi Investment Office said this month it had invested $100 million to encourage four agricultural technology firms to build research and development facilities in the emirate. U.S-based AeroFarms said it wants to construct the biggest vertical farm of its kind in the world -- in which crops are grown in layers -- with the first harvest by mid-2021.

Policy makers are “likely to double-down on tech-based solutions following the end of the crisis,” said Daniel Moshashai, geopolitics and infrastructure analyst for the Middle East at Castlereagh Associates, a London-based consultancy. “Technology will help in the much-needed localization, including for food production.”

Two, any foreign material that is obviously not in a coronavirus *but detected elsewhere* would be the most obvious thing to find. Just look at that sloppy preprint--people were saying HIV sequences were in this virus when that was clearly not the case. If you take foreign material of *known* origin and insert it obviously where it doesn't belong, it will be essentially the first thing we know about this virus. 

Three, viruses are typically very unstable to genetic manipulation of any foreign insertion. The idea that you could put a random sequence in without any consequence or loss of fitness is absolutely hokey sci-fi nonsense. Many of these viruses would kick out such a reporter after the second transmission event, and perhaps never make it off the ground. 

Four, even animal passaging would leave obvious signatures in the genome. This would be in the form of codon bias, GC/U content, or other quirks. The list goes on.

And when the US reopens I can promise you it'll happen slowly and with face coverings. This isn't over, we can't hide forever but if we go back to normal we'll cause a second spike and overwhelm medical staff who don't have adequate PPE and cause mass outbreaks among our medical staff. Homemade masks and people looking like cowboys will be the norm this summer, especially in metros.

The spread in the US is bad but not worse than other countries. We account for 1/4 of accounted for cases but also have vastly higher populations than many places- and places that have higher populations have lower testing.

Also, the numbers in China, Russia or any other real or de facto dictatorships are useless. Third world countries are not giving realistic numbers, either.

In 2009 during H1N1 there were 18,884 confirmed deaths by the end of it, and the WHO said 284,00 estimated. Only some like 108 people tested positive and died in Africa and they're guessing it was closer to about 80-100k dead in Africa. Less than 99.5% testing rate after they examined data.

We don't really know where coronavirus is, and first world countries with slightly more transparent testing and reporting will skew heavily in initial numbers. We've seen this before.

So, no, the US isn't worse. I can cherry pick California and Italy, because California has 40 million and Italy 60 million and say if I increased my state's numbers by 50% we get a rough per capita comparison. California has roughly 27,500 confirmed cases. If I scale our population to Italy's that's 41,250 and Italy for 60m people would have 169,000 confirmed cases which means Italy is four times worse.

But New York is 9 million people, so if I multiply there's by 7 to get a per capita distribution it's 1.5 million infected scaled to match Italy, which now means the US is like... 9 times worse.

Or, I scale Itally up to our total population and they have 1.01 million infected which beats our total of 650k cases.

The US isn't 'the worst'. We just have the highest confirmed cases in the world but one of the slightly more accurate reporting systems versus China- who's government is likely lying- or say India, who's heathcare varies widely by region and income, moreso than say the US.

And if you want the highest rate of infection in the world it's San Marino and Vatican city- and like 1.5% of Vatican city's residents are infected because 8 out of a city of 600 some people is huge, so I'd say really it's Vatican City who's the worst because how do you lose that much of your workforce? And they're all old."

Firstly, the players are not and never have been the problem when it comes to money in the sport. The players are the ones who have actually carried the burden of the game's poor commercial performance for the last 20 years.

They've been subject to two decades of real-terms pay cuts, with a salary cap that is now £1m less than it was in real terms compared to 1999. They're also playing more games than those players were 20 years ago. They're being subjected to an increasingly physical environment that is causing serious long-term damage to their health. They're being told that they will have to play three games a week once this is all over by some quarters, and being told that they'll have to accept pay cuts if they want to scrap loop fixtures by others. And now this.

The people who should be facing the brunt of the cuts are the commercial managers, marketing managers, PR managers and club owners and chairmen that have got the sport and their clubs in the position where there is nothing in the rainy day fund and to the position where we cannot pay the players properly in the first place. I get that the coronavirus is an exceptional circumstance, but let's not pretend that the house of cards wasn't already wobbling.

And the point about 'blackballing' players who don't comply really sticks in the throat. It's the very tactic that Derek Beaumont used against Leigh players when he woke up one morning and decided that he didn't want to honour contracts that he entered into. Pointing at the players and going ""everyone else has helped, but these players here won't and that's the reason we might go bust"" is, whichever way you want to cut it, the tactic of a complete cunt."

Antibodies don’t mean you automatically beat the disease. In other virus this is more clear (like HIV, you can detected by antibodies, nobody beat the disease with them)

“It is less clear what those antibody tests mean for real life, however, because immunity functions on a continuum. With some pathogens, such as the varicella-zoster virus (which causes chicken pox), infection confers near-universal, long-lasting resistance. Natural infection with Clostridium tetani, the bacterium that causes tetanus, on the other hand, offers no protection—and even people getting vaccinated for it require regular booster shots. On the extreme end of this spectrum, individuals infected with HIV often have large amounts of antibodies that do nothing to prevent or clear the disease.”

[source: scientific American ](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.scientificamerican.com/article/what-immunity-to-covid-19-really-means/%3famp=true) 

Many people are actually dying for an overreaction of the inmune system. This is called cytokine storm (and this explained the higher mortality of the Spanish flu). All this people are making antibodies too (and dying)

This underestimates what happens when we open too soon.

I'll lay out a likely scenario. My company reopens. Someone comes in with coronavirus, shedding but not symptomatic. Three weeks later, half of my team is out and bedridden. I've gone from my team working at home, to not working. We're missing deadlines and falling apart. Economically, this is infinitely worse than our current situation.

Let's say one dies. Or maybe they infect a family member that dies, or even just ends up on a ventilator. If you find out that Bob from accounting died, or that the woman in the next cubicle is hospitalized, would you rush back to the office? Or would you want to work from home for a while?

What if a server at your favorite restaurant dies? Would you rush back there?

If we open too soon, all of this will happen. We'll still have the economic distress, likely amplified because there's much less of a clear end, only now we'll have death, fear, and panic."

>Berlin (CNN)President Donald Trump shocked not just Americans but many around the world with his insistence this week that -- at least insofar as reopening his country's coronavirus-wracked economy is concerned -- his ""authority is total.""

>With apparent disregard for the US Constitution, which confers sweeping powers to state-level authorities, Trump cried ""mutiny"" after Democratic governors objected to his pronouncement. One such governor, New York's Andrew Cuomo, whose state has borne the brunt of the Covid-19 outbreak in the US, said the President was ""clearly spoiling for a fight on this issue."" The President later backed down, in part at least.

>But as Trump chafes at the constitutional order in the US, another similarly decentralized country more than 4,000 miles away is getting a markedly different lesson in leadership. ""Federalism is not there so people can push away responsibility,"" German Chancellor Angela Merkel said early on in the pandemic. ""It is there so that every takes responsibility in their area.""

>To be sure, Germans have questioned whether their system, which devolves significant responsibilities to state and local levels, was best-suited to dealing with a fast-moving, international crisis like the coronavirus pandemic. Many asked whether Merkel, 15 years in office and dealing with a mystery health issue that gave her bouts of the shivers at public events, was capable of leading the charge. Was she ""amtsmuede"" -- weary of office?

>But, so far at least, the German system has held its own, and Merkel has maintained her grip -- in typically understated fashion. In particular, her measured addresses to the nation have contrasted sharply with Trump's raucous daily briefings, which have roiled stock markets and alarmed health experts.

>""How many loved ones will we lose, how high will the price be,"" asked Merkel, in one of her most emotional addresses, on March 18. In an appeal for everyone to work together, she added: ""It is in our own hands to influence the outcome of this crisis. I am convinced that we will manage to act responsibly to save lives.""

>Unified approach

>Merkel's words helped unify Germany behind the government's response. The governor of the powerful state of Baden-Wuerttemburg, Winfried Kretschmann of the Green Party, which is a rival of Merkel's conservative CDU, drew a scathing comparison between Germany and the US: ""We can see in the United States that some governors are taking matters into their own hands when there is someone at the helm who at first denied all of these threats. Something like that is completely out of the question here, that is why we are well equipped for this crisis.""

>It is too early to make final assessments, but Germany's response is looked upon with envy around the world. While the country has a large number of confirmed COVID-19 cases, the death toll remains remarkably low and the health system remains robust.

>After a meeting with state leaders Wednesday, Merkel announced that the country was ready to start carefully scaling back its lockdown. Many shops will be allowed to reopen next week, and schools will gradually reopen beginning early next month, though other restrictions will remain in place.

>""She's a diplomatic leader,"" says Jan Techau, a senior fellow at the German Marshall Fund, noting her ability to generate consensus among the country's strong state governors. ""She can actually take a step back, become almost invisible and become the power-broker in the system. This has been her approach for the last 15 years, and it is especially useful in these kinds of moments when you have a crisis where you have to bring these people together where so much is at stake.""

>Governors shape Merkel's plan

>Federalism is as entrenched in Germany as it is in the United States. The chancellor in Berlin cannot force the governors of the nation's 16 states to enforce social distancing measures, temporarily close restaurants and cafes, or shut down schools and universities. But they have gone along with, and helped shape, the common approach which Merkel said would constantly be re-evaluated to ensure people's freedoms are not unnecessarily impeded.

>""We know that our policies can only be effective if we closely coordinated them between federal government and the states,"" Merkel said in the early stages of the response to the pandemic. The success of Germany's approach to combating coronavirus would not have materialized if politicians on both state and federal levels had not set aside their differences.

>Just like the United States, Germany is in the run up to a landmark election. In 2021, possibly even earlier, the country will elect Merkel's successor. Germany's health minister and two of the most powerful state governors are viewed as favorites to win the job. But all of them have agreed to focus on the coronavirus crisis and halt any sort of political showboating.

>The head of Germany's largest state, North Rhine-Westphalia, Armin Laschet, says Germany's strong and unified reaction to the pandemic and the barrage of measures adopted across the country show that ""federalism is capable of acting.""

>Merkel has been rewarded for the Germany's strong and efficient response. Her approval ratings have increased dramatically and she is currently the most popular politician in the country. But Merkel hasn't been bragging. Techau, of the German Marshall Fund, believes success in a decentralized, federal system comes down to exactly that: Less talk, more leadership.

>""There must be somebody who is the national face of the crisis response. That's what a chancellor that's what a president are there for. And you have to play that role. And you best play it by acknowledging that you are not the master, who's in charge of everything, but who, you know, needs to personify the unified responds with the country.""

I think you're confusing 'reinfection' with contracting a mutation of the coronavirus. 

A vaccine may not help in the case of a mutation of coronavirus, as they'd mostly likely have to develop a new vaccine for the new strain. Much like the flu, if you get vaccinated against one strain you still run the risk of getting sick from another strain of the flu. Scientists who create vaccines estimate which strain of flu will be the most active that season, often a year or so in advance. At least, well before that season's flu strain is active."

WASHINGTON — The Trump administration is expected on Thursday to weaken regulations on the release of mercury and other toxic metals from oil and coal-fired power plants, another step toward rolling back health protections in the middle of a pandemic.

The final Environmental Protection Agency rule does not eliminate restrictions on the release of mercury, a heavy metal linked to brain damage. Environmental lawyers said the new method of calculating the costs and benefits of curbing mercury pollution would most likely destroy the legal underpinnings of controls on mercury and many other pollutants.

By reducing the health benefit of regulations on paper, while raising their economic costs, the new method could be used to justify loosening restrictions on any pollutant that the fossil fuel industry has deemed too costly to control.

“That is the big unstated goal,” said David Konisky, a professor of public and environmental affairs at Indiana University. “This is less about mercury than about potentially constraining or handcuffing future efforts by the E.P.A. to regulate air pollution.”

The Trump administration’s long-running effort to reduce regulatory burdens on industry has ramped up in recent weeks despite emerging scientific links between dirty air and Covid-19 death rates. While the nation struggles with the coronavirus, the administration has loosened curbs on automobile tailpipe emissions and opted not to strengthen a regulation on industrial soot emissions.

The deregulatory rush appears designed to secure less restrictive rules quickly, in case Republicans lose control of Congress and the White House in November. A new government could move quickly under the Congressional Review Act to overturn any regulation or federal rule within 60 days of it being finalized — making any rule completed after late May or early June vulnerable.

Mandy Gunasekara, a Republican strategist, testified in February to a House committee that the changes to the mercury rule, then in the planning stages, would “fix a dishonest accounting mechanism that the last administration used to justify any regulatory action regardless of costs.” Ms. Gunasekara has since become chief of staff to Andrew R. Wheeler, the E.P.A. administrator.

Environmental lawyers and public health leaders called the timing of the final mercury rule as well as its substance an attack on air quality.

“What is most disconcerting to me is this administration’s lack of interest in science and, frankly, their lack of concern for our nation’s children,” said Aaron Bernstein, interim director of the Center for Climate, Health and the Global Environment at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health. “Mercury pollution in the United States damages our children’s brains before they even come into the world, and estimates are that that cost is in the billions of dollars.”

Patrick Parenteau, a professor at the Vermont Law School, noted that in virtually every environmental rollback, President Trump’s E.P.A. has acknowledged in the fine print that enormous increases in health problems and deaths will occur because of increased pollution.

A plan to weaken carbon dioxide emissions at power plants, for example, predicted as many as 1,400 additional premature deaths a year. A draft analysis of the soot policy put forward this week showed that tightening the existing standard by 25 percent could save as many as 12,150 lives a year.

Two people close to the administration said the White House was concerned enough about the public perception of loosening environmental rules during the outbreak that it held the mercury plan for several weeks after it passed a review from the White House Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs. E.P.A. officials assured the White House that the agency was merely responding as required to a 2015 Supreme Court ruling that found it must justify the economic impact of the mercury standards.

The weakening of the mercury rule would be one of the most significant regulatory rollbacks engineered by the Trump administration. The existing federal regulation on mercury pollution, completed in 2012, is the most expensive clean air regulation ever written by the E.P.A.

When it published its draft cost-benefit changes last year, the E.P.A. said the cost of cutting mercury from power plant emissions “dwarfs” the economic benefits and argued that the Obama rule could not be justified as “appropriate and necessary.”

The E.P.A.’s 2012 regulation was the first federal standard to require power plants to install pricey pollution controls to limit mercury emissions — at a cost to industry of $9.6 billion a year. The Obama administration justified that cost by tallying the benefits not just of reducing mercury but also “co-benefits” like reducing sulfur dioxide, fine particulate matter and other pollutants that were also curbed by the equipment.

Driving down mercury emissions alone, the studies at the time found, would yield a $6 million annual benefit, a fraction of the cost of controls. But with the rest of the co-benefits and the projected gains in avoided heart disease, asthma attacks and other health problems, the benefits reached $80 billion over five years. Overall, the Obama administration estimated that the rule would prevent 4,700 heart attacks, 130,000 asthma attacks and 11,000 premature deaths each year.

Under the Trump administration’s new rule, such co-benefits will no longer be calculated with cost, only direct benefits.

While coal producers urged Mr. Trump to roll back the rule, the vast majority of electric utility companies have agreed the cost-benefit changes may be of little help to them, because they have already spent the billions of dollars needed to come into compliance. Many of those companies urged the Trump administration to leave the mercury measure in place.

Coal plants subject to the rule “have already spent millions of dollars to install mercury equipment to reduce mercury emissions,” wrote Scott A. Weaver, the director of air quality services for American Electric Power, an Ohio-based electric utility company that operates power plants in 11 states, in a public comment on a draft of the rule.

“Rescinding the standards at this point will create new problems” Mr. Weaver wrote, noting that companies that have sought to recoup the cost of installing mercury control equipment through bills to customers may no longer legally be able to do so. That means the new rule could actually cost companies more money.

Despite such assurances, Matthew Davis, a former E.P.A. scientist who worked with the agency’s office of children’s health protection to develop the original rule, said weakening the rule still represented a threat to children’s health.

“The reason we did this rule is because children and developing fetuses are harmed by mercury,” said Mr. Davis, who now works at the League of Conservation Voters.

The new rule is a victory for one of Mr. Wheeler’s former lobbying clients, Murray Energy Corporation, one of the nation’s largest coal companies, which declared bankruptcy last year and is undergoing a reorganization. The company’s former chief executive, Bob Murray, a major donor to Mr. Trump’s inauguration fund, personally requested the rollback of the mercury rule soon after Mr. Trump took office, in a written “wish list” that he handed to Rick Perry, who was energy secretary at the time.

Jeffrey R. Holmstead, an attorney for the electric utility industry who served in the E.P.A. under the second President George Bush, rejected the idea that the decision was a cynical calculation to set the stage for other regulatory rollbacks.

“It’s not as if the administration has been shy about rolling back other things,” Mr. Holmstead said, dismissing environmental concerns. “I don’t think there’s any impact whatsoever from this,” he said.

In Congress, the Obama-era mercury rule has bipartisan support. Senator Thomas R. Carper of Delaware, the top Democrat on the Environment and Public Works committee, and Senator Lamar Alexander of Tennessee, the chairman of an energy and water appropriations subcommittee, wrote an opinion piece in USA Today in November urging the Trump administration to leave the regulation unchanged.

“Changing the rule after billions of dollars have already been spent means that utilities will have less certainty about federal regulations,” they wrote. “The gains we have made over the past decade to protect children and families from dangerous mercury pollution should not be lost.”"

We live in Bethesda. I love living in Bethesda. But it has nothing to do with what you're describing. The ""world"" that you're describing tends to hang out with itself, and your interaction with it will be sparse.

My closest interaction with what you are describing is that one of my kids was in preschool with one of the Trump grandkids. But that was in DC, it was a few years ago, and it was actually kinda awkward given my view of Trump and his children.

Other than that, my interaction is primarily with far lower amounts of power:  civil servants, a shitload of attorney (myself included), some think tank people. The highest up we move in the range of ""power"" is really really peripheral stuff: an ex-congressman's adult children live in my neighborhood, a friend of ours is fairly high up in a group advising the Government on Coronavirus, one of our good friends has a pretty high position in the Navy -- but like, no one you'd ever see on TV or read about in the papers.

The stock market is based on expectations. When the Coronavirus anxiety started around the end of February, WWE's stock was around $47/share. By mid-March when everything shut down, WWE's stock fell to just above $30/share. This was due to expectations regarding entertainment and sports companies being shutdown a while.

I think the stock price for WWE has already adjusted to what the experts think it should be given what expectations will be for the next 6-12 months - a gradual reopening of the economy including shows with live crowds at some point. The effects from the Coronavirus have already been factored into the stock price for the most part."

Not made in a lab, not deliberate but also not from the wet markets. 

The institute is 250m from the wet market accused of being the source. NOTE: Early conspiracy theories include the Wuhan Institute for Virology, those conspiracy theories about it being deliberate are widely debunked but have now mingled the Virology institute with the theories.

They interview people that are infected in order to see who they may have come into contact with and have created a web of connection or degrees of separation amongst the public. One of the reasons that Vietnam has been so successful is because their people trust their governement. They know the governement has been open with them and they have voluntarily shared information with governement health officials and scientists in order to track the spread of the virus. Also, Vietnam declared a national emergency in relation to the virus on January 3rd.

Are you acting like if there was a step by step plan for recolution reformist would change their minds

Here is a step by step example of non electoral organization preparing for such crises. Of course a non electoral leftist socialist party is required

First: Print out a map of your operating region. Let's say it's a large metropolis like New York City

Then, research the poorest, most crime-infested, and dangerous parts of the city. Highlight those parts in red.

Then, find the richest, most prosperous parts of the operating region. highlight those sections in Blue.

Debate among your band, which of the red segments you'll choose first. This will be your center of operations, you'll focus all your attention here.

Next, gather information. Commit a map of your territory to memory. Interview as many people as you possibly can about local issues, about the nature of problems in the community. Learn about every pothole, learn about every piece of graffiti, every crack house, every local gang, every intersection in desperate need of a stop sign, etc.

Develop an action plan to win over people in the community. If they're worried about kids lacking education, offer to have free tutoring sessions. If people seem concerned about graffiti, then offer to clean it up. If poverty is a problem, run a food drive. Make sure all your efforts stay exclusive to the community.

It's important that structural problems are addressed within the community, however. The goal isn't to provide charity, but to uplift and organize the community such that it can start tackling long term problems on its own.

Long term problems are things like crime, failing infrastructure, education. You can tackle all these things initially as organizers, but the goal is to give these people the tools to start tackling them themselves

Once you undeniably win over a plurality of the community, start to organize them collectively. Develop assemblies where they discuss problems and tackle them on the basis of direct democracy and direct action.

Upon a community forming a fully developed assembly council and making it through a full election, split off like a beehive.

Part of your organizational structure will go to another red zone and will repeat the process there
continue until all the red zones within your operating theater are organized 

Once they're organized, link them together in interdependent charters. Essentially the goal is to make a web of communes that wrap around the blue sections and can share resources and labor with one another.

Divide the blue sections into islands, such that they're isolated in a sea of soviets

Once an operating theater is sufficiently organized, move to the next one. Another town, another county, another state, another region.

The goal is to create a web stretching from sea to sea and bound together with one idea and common party lines and coordination

You can use whatever tools at your disposal. Elections, militancy, strikes, protests, legal battles

All and all when the system starts to fall down you are in a better position than almost everybody else"

Consider this:

>Widdowson, the former CDC scientist, was part of a team that estimated global deaths from the 2009 H1N1 swine flu pandemic. The World Health Organization recorded 18,631 people with laboratory-confirmed diagnoses dying of that disease. But the pandemic probably caused 15 times as many deaths, the CDC team concluded in 2012.

So h1n1 was undercounted by sevenfold in the U.S. and as much as fifteenfold worldwide. And both of those studies took a couple years to conduct so we won't know the true toll for awhile.

>""We have both a lower demand of patients coming in and a very much reduced wait time to admission of patients that need to be admitted,"" said Dr. Paul Doucet, an ER doctor at St. Boniface Hospital. 

>Data collected from the WRHA's online wait-time dashboard shows volumes are down between about 30 to 50 per cent since the World Health Organization declared the spread of the novel coronavirus a global pandemic on March 11.

>Doucet said he believes people are staying home because they don't want exposure to COVID-19, and hospital administrators have temporarily created capacity for anticipated COVID-19 patients by cancelling elective surgeries and clinics.

>""So patients that have been waiting in the ER, which has always been a major problem for our flow through the ER, those people who are waiting for admission are moved up to the appropriate wards in a very much reduced time frame,"" he said.

>Between Feb. 1 and the day the pandemic was declared, the average number of patients being actively treated by a physician at the Health Sciences Centre at any given time was 44. Since that time, that figure has dropped to just 28. Over the same period, average wait times dropped from four hours to 2.8.

>At Grace Hospital, the average number of patients being treated at any given time fell by more than 46 per cent.

>On March 13, the Manitoba government announced schools would imminently be closed and the federal government imposed drastic travel restrictions. This exact moment coincides with the dramatic drop in ER visits, the data shows, but Doucet couldn't say whether that meant patients were seeking help elsewhere.

>""It's surprising and hard to say with certainty … the fear is that people aren't getting care and that this burden of illness may be increased in the community and that people will pay a price and we'll start seeing more people that have been avoiding care for a variety of reasons and maybe increasing numbers in the near term,"" he said. 

>Compared to 2019 data, the current trend strongly suggests that COVID-19 is the primary driver of this drop in emergency room activity, and not some other seasonal factor.

>Manitoba's chief nursing officer Lanette Siragusa said the drop in volume and wait times coincides with the province's first cases announced March 12, and the time leading up to that. 

>""We did see a reduction in the emergency room wait times and the volumes of patients coming in, lower than we've ever seen that I can remember in several years,"" she said, adding the phenomenon is likely due to several factors.  

>""People are not coming to emergency for the things that maybe they did before, and Dr. Roussin has mentioned several times at these media conferences that if you need medical care, you really should be seeking medical care, whether it's your primary care provider or the emergency room.""

>She added although people are also likely staying home to avoid the virus or system impact, there may be an added benefit of not having other diseases spreading around as much in the community. 

>""I can't really explain why it's happened but we agree, it is happening and it's been happening now for many weeks and we may actually experience a rebound at some point too,"" she said. 

>Doucet said it's been nice to have volumes and wait times reduced, but added that postponing non-elective surgeries is not sustainable long-term, as people still need them. There are also more infection control measures, stress and anxiety for staff as they look after people who end up not being COVID-positive. The devastating impact of the virus on areas like New York, Italy and Spain has also brought an added stress, he said.

>""It seems like we've been saying for weeks, it's the quiet before the storm and there's this dread of what's coming.""

>But for now, there's some room for optimism, he said, especially given the co-ordinated response so far by government, hospitals and other groups to prepare for the pandemic. 

>""It's been a very humbling experience being part of a health-care provider group that's really kind of worked well as a team,"" he said.

>""I'd like people to continue listening to our public health officials and following the social distancing policies. It seems like it's making a very big difference here in Manitoba and all health-care professionals are very appreciative of the public's understanding and the measures they've taken."""

* **I want to bring your attention to a site which is presenting a lot of graphs more elegantly and effectively than some of my own crude attempts.

Please check it out here: https://advaithasabnis.github.io/covid19/ **
* There was a double-log incoming vs total cases graph, explained here https://www.reddit.com/r/CanadaCoronavirus/comments/fqxgi7/how_to_tell_if_were_beating_covid19/. I've retired my graph for this; it's better done elsewhere - e.g. in this graph you can see the provinces as they drop out of exponential growth: https://aatishb.com/covidtrends/?region=Canada&location=Alberta&location=British+Columbia&location=Manitoba&location=New+Brunswick&location=Newfoundland+and+Labrador&location=Nova+Scotia&location=Ontario&location=Quebec&location=Saskatchewan 
* Here are some other graphs I'm playing with (MultiTrends): https://imgur.com/a/CeB2WXT

* Canadian data from virihealth.com (from PHAC & provinces), USA data from coronavirus.1point3acres.com, Other national data was from WHO sitreps.
* I am not an epidemiologist. I'm not a government employee. I don't even play a doctor on TV. I just like numbers.

This data is admittedly imperfect: testing is incomplete, there is a test backlog, and reporting is not completely fluid.  This is too simplistic a model for realistic projection, given all of the unknowns and variables of such a complex system.  That said, I'll continue to track this, to see where it goes.

Today's data notes:  

* Today was a rough day. Records in new deaths and new cases, and cumulative positives passed 30K. 
* Nationally, 2028 are hospitalized (+35 from yesterday, and a new high), and 541 are in ICU (-18 from yesterday; the high water mark was 575 on Apr 13). As these numbers climb, the burden on our healthcare workers will increase. Godspeed and thanks to them as they stand on guard for thee and me. 
* Canada had a terrible new death toll of 185 today, bringing the cumulative total deaths to 1195. A devastating toll of 143 in QC, 38 in ON, 2 each in AB & BC.  3.97% of known positives are deceased. This is higher than average, but we've had a lot of senior care homes hit. Also, this is not really the mortality rate, since that won't be known until all those infected are recovered or not, and may vary significantly if the healthcare system is overwhelmed.
* People tested (+18,606) = 495,225 (1.32% of the population). Testing up from over 13.8K yesterday.
* Tested positive (+1727) = 30,106 (6.08% of those tested). The cumulative hit rate climbs slightly from 5.95% yesterday, rising 23 days in a row. The higher hit rate is concerning, particularly in QC(10.7% overall, 18.5% today) and ON (7.2% overall, 5.6% today). Ontario was relatively good today, completing 9107 tests and reducing the daily hit rate considerably. Quebec had an awful day, finding nearly 1000 new cases with just 5397 tested.
* Test backlog - 7639 today, up from 7417 yesterday. 
* Recovered (+750) = 9729 (32.32% of known positives). PEI, SK, NB, NL and BC are above 50% recovered. AB was briefly above 50% on Apr12 but has regressed below after an increase in cases.
* Known active = 19,182 (Total positives - recovered - deceased). The unknowns are unknown. 
* The bump in China's number @ day 29 was due to a change in the way their cases were categorized.
* The growth rate appears in cases seems to be slowing. Higher doubling time is better. March16 - doubling rate= every 2.84 days; March23=2.74 days; Mar30=4.21 days; Apr6=8.19 days. My latest week-averaged doubling rate: Apr13=11.7 days.
* World notes: France led Europe with 1438 deaths today. Russia blazes past Switzerland +3K to almost 28K, and expect to pass Netherlands tomorrow."

>WASHINGTON — Ivanka Trump, President Trump’s eldest daughter and a senior White House adviser, has positioned herself as one of the leaders of the administration’s economic relief efforts and one of its most vocal advocates of social distancing.

>“Those lucky enough to be in a position to stay at home, please, please do so,” Ms. Trump said in a video she posted online, encouraging Americans to follow federal guidelines about social distancing, which suggests that people stay at least six feet apart. “Each and every one of us plays a role in slowing the spread.”

>But Ms. Trump herself has not followed the federal guidelines advising against discretionary travel, leaving Washington for another one of her family’s homes, even as she has publicly thanked people for self-quarantining. And effective April 1, the city of Washington issued a stay-at-home order for all residents unless they are performing essential activities.

>Ms. Trump and her husband, Jared Kushner, who is also a senior White House adviser, traveled with their three children to the Trump National Golf Club Bedminster in New Jersey to celebrate the first night of Passover this month, according to two people with knowledge of their travel plans, even as seders across the country were canceled and families gathered remotely over apps like Zoom.

>A White House spokesman did not respond to a request for comment.

>Mr. Kushner returned to the White House, where he has been helping marshal the forces of government for the war his father-in-law says he is waging against the coronavirus. Ms. Trump has continued to work from Bedminster, taking calls and spending time there with her children, the people said.

>Ms. Trump has told people that the club is currently shut down, making it more socially distant than her mansion in the Kalorama neighborhood of Washington, where she had been spotted running on occasion in Rock Creek Park.

>On Wednesday, Ms. Trump participated remotely in at least two of the president’s calls with business leaders he is consulting with as he seeks to reopen the country’s economy, according to someone familiar with the calls.

>Before leaving for Bedminster, Ms. Trump appeared at her father’s side in the White House’s Roosevelt Room after lobbying top bank executives to commit to the Paycheck Protection Program, a relief effort intended to help small businesses weather the pandemic. Ms. Trump has been focused on helping small businesses become a path to the country’s economic recovery, and at the event, Mr. Trump, as he often does, falsely credited his daughter with creating “over 15 million jobs.”

>Ms. Trump has instructed her small West Wing staff to work remotely if possible and not to enter the White House grounds unless necessary. She has also posted pictures of herself building a tent with a bedsheet in her living room as a creative idea for parents stuck at home with stir-crazy children.

>“We’re all in this together,” she said in a video message she posted on social media.

>“We’ll emerge from this stronger than ever before, and maybe more deeply and profoundly connected with our own humanity and our core values,” she said, adding, “Let’s do everything we can to stop the spread.”"

Non so se sia adatto pubblicare questa domanda in questo thread o se sia meglio farlo nel caffé, o ancora come post esterno, ma ormai sono qui ed essendo Coronavirus-related scrivo qui (?)

Sono un lavoratore dipendente presso una azienda a tempo indeterminato, classico contratto da 8 ore al giorno Lunedì-Venerdì.  
Ieri mi è stata consegnata la busta paga riguardante il mese di Marzo, e mi sono trovato il solito netto in fondo.  
Poi, scorrendo le varie voci, ho notato che mi sono state segnate 80 ore di assenza (quindi due settimane), e subito dopo una certa voce, ASSEGNO ORD. FONDO SOLID., che dal poco che so dovrebbe essere la cassa integrazione, anch'esso di 80 ore. Il problema è che in quelle due settimane io sono rimasto a casa, connesso anche piu delle canoniche otto ore al mio pc, operando nella ormai nota modalità identificata dal governo come ""smart working"".  
Chiaramente gli importi erano diversi, perche la cassa integrazione non corrisponde al 100% della retribuzione, quindi come ultima voce un ""PREMIO"", che più volte mi sono ritrovato in busta paga, ma mai con un importo cosi alto. Da quel che deduco è un valore che viene utilizzato (nella mia ditta, almeno) per ""riempire"" e far risultare lo stipendio netto sempre uguale.

So che dovrei rivolgermi a un commercialista data la mia ignoranza nel settore, ma in questi tempi è arduo riuscire a consultarne uno per via dell'emergenza, per cui chiedo a voi, magari qualcuno di ferrato saprebbe dirmi se è una cosa normale tutto questo, o se in qualche modo io ci stia perdendo qualcosa (contributi, non so) e dovrei farmi sentire dal mio datore di lavoro, chiarendo le cose.

TL;DR: cassa integrazione e ""premi"" in busta paga inficiano in qualche modo la quantità di contributi che un lavoratore si vede versare?"

When Trump wanted to minimize the threat of Coronavirus, he praised China, because that played into the narrative that the virus was contained.

Now Trump has shifted to a different narrative, and it’s now beneficial to him to blame China, because it diverts blame from him.

Whether Trump portrays China as praiseworthy or blameworthy has nothing to do with the reality of China’s actions, or Trump’s knowledge of that reality — it all hinges on the political reality of the moment, as Trump sees it."

2020-04-16,YoungThinker1999,neoliberal,9,https://www.reddit.com/r/neoliberal/comments/g29znc/discussion_thread/fnnhvqp/,"Guys, I didn't realize this before, but Missouri is really underrated as a target for Democratic party expansion. 

You have, Nicole Galloway, the only Democrat (a moderate) elected to statewide office in Missouri facing off against a Republican incumbent (Mike Parsons) who was never actually elected to the position of governor. He became Governor only because the previous Republican governor (Eric Greitans) was forced to resign after being charged with several felonies related to campaign finance violations. Galloway would be Missouri's first female Governor. Greitans only narrowly won in the 2016 gubernatorial election and was preceded by a two-term Democratic Governor. In 2018, Missouri voters rejected a right-to-work law in a public referendum, voted to raise the minimum wage, and passed a constitutional amendment creating a bipartisan redistricting committee (putting an end to the grossly gerrymandered state legislative boundaries beginning in 2022). In general, Missouri seems like a relatively light red state.

The polls do show Galloway behind by 15 points, but if the coronavirus pandemic (and resulting economic crisis) gets bad in Missouri, that could very well change.

If Democrats can win the Missouri gubernatorial race, then they veto any attempt by the Republican party to gerrymander the state's congressional districts (the Republicans do not have a sufficiently strong majority in the state legislature to override a gubernatorial veto). However, it wouldn't necessarily lead to any appreciable difference for the state legislature as voters already approved the aforementioned bipartisan redistricting commission. Still, I think the takeaway here is that Democrats can win in rural states with sufficiently weak opponents and a sufficiently strong (i.e moderate) candidate. Democrats won the Kentucky and Louisiana gubernatorial elections last year, they won the Kansas gubernatorial race in 2018, so why couldn't they win the Missouri gubernatorial race this year?

If the Democrats can win this gubernatorial contest, they could capitalize on the end of gerrymandering throughout the 2020s to combine the power of the governor with gains in the state legislature to implement some much-needed reforms (and maybe even achieve the trifecta needed to dramatically expand voting rights). In 2020 Missouri is going to hold a referendum on whether to expand Medicaid, one which is expected to pass."

>The reasons for the above data differences: first, the surge of patients in the early stage of the epidemic led to a run on medical resources and a serious shortage of treatment capacity. Some patients were not hospitalized and died at home. Second, in the peak period of treatment, the hospital is overloaded and the medical staff are busy with treatment. There are objective phenomena of delayed, missed and erroneous reports. Third, due to the rapid increase of designated medical institutions for the treatment of patients, there are not only ministerial, provincial, municipal and district hospitals, but also enterprises, private hospitals and fangcang hospitals, and a small number of medical institutions failed to connect with and submit information to the epidemic network in time. Fourth, some death cases are not completely registered, and there are repeated and erroneous reports.

>Life first, people first. Every life lost in the epidemic is a family mourning, but also the pain of the city. In novel coronavirus pneumonia, we extend our sincere condolences to the families of the dead and the compatriots who died and express their deep condolences."

The novel coronavirus showed a 94% genetic similarity to the virus observed in bats by this very lab in previous studies. 

The initial cases were all accurately reported and traced to customers and vendors in the wet market where its common for bats to be sold. 

The idea that this lab was somehow cooking up viruses as some sort of bio weapon are ludicrous, and of course a favorite new conspiracy theory of the alt-right Trumpers. 

 Not saying you were one, I only wanted to add to your point and for the OP. Cheers!

People like the elderly, those with compromised immune systems, and the like.

I really don't see how your condition (autism) would make you more physically vulnerable to the virus.

IMO you going there during those hours would not be appropriate."
