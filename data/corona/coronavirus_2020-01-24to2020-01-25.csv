2020-01-24,CompMolNeuro,WTF,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/WTF/comments/esy56k/coronavirus_victim_being_wheeled_across_the_street/ffec15x/,Like SARS?  Coronaviruses have a long incubation period while still being infectious.  The week or two a person walks around shedding virus before any serious symptoms hit makes transmission exponential.  SARS killed 10%.  Even assuming this new coronavirus takes 5% before we have some treatment there are two cities quarantined and cases popping up all over the world.  No one is blowing anything out of proportion.  Why don't you walk into a hospital and say MRSA because that's the reaction you could be having next year.

If the quarantined are all confirmed cases of coronavirus, then that's some scary shit. But I would think more likely, and given what the parent comment said, all those people coming to the hospital because they think they may be showing symptoms of it (i.e. large number of people who just have a regular cold/flu) would be put into quarantine just in case.

Now, I have no medical experience or qualifications, so I don't know anything really, but I'd think that most likely, a significant number of people being quarantined are suspected or potential cases rather than confirmed ones.. in which case that's going to be a *lot* of people, and would result in scenes like that video. Which would basically mean that it looks far worse than it actually is.

On the other hand, *if* they are actually all confirmed cases in quarantine, then that's scary as shit."

From WHO’s website: “Common signs include respiratory symptoms, fever, cough, shortness of breath, and breathing difficulties. In more severe cases, infection can cause pneumonia, severe acute respiratory syndrome, kidney failure and even death.”

https://www.who.int/news-room/q-a-detail/q-a-coronaviruses

2. From MOH’s statement addressing travellers to China but I think we can all refer to the points as well:

Travellers should adopt the following precautions at all times:
- Avoid contact with live animals including poultry and birds, and consumption of raw and undercooked meats;
- Avoid crowded places and close contact with people who are unwell or showing symptoms of illness;
- Observe good personal hygiene;
- Practise frequent hand washing with soap (e.g. before handling food or eating, after going to toilet, or when hands are dirtied by respiratory secretions after coughing or sneezing);
- Wear a mask if you have respiratory symptoms such as a cough or runny nose; (**)
- Cover your mouth with a tissue paper when coughing or sneezing, and dispose the soiled tissue paper in the rubbish bin immediately; and
- Seek medical attention promptly if you are feeling unwell. (*)

https://www.moh.gov.sg/news-highlights/details/moh-updates-public-health-travel-advisory-in-response-to-cases-of-novel-coronavirus-in-china

(*) Please don’t overreact and call an ambulance/go to the hospital. 
- Wear a mask, and go to the nearest clinic, where the doctor will be able to listen to your lungs and also check your throat and nasal pathways to determine whether what you have is just the common cold, the flu, or something more. If so, the clinic will help you to call the ambulance and send you off with the doctor’s memo, and the paramedics & the A&E hospital staff will already be aware of your symptoms as informed, and will quarantine you to prevent any spreading, until the results of your diagnostic tests return to show whether it really is the Wuhan virus, or it could also be bronchitis, or other respiratory conditions.
- The reason this is important is because we don’t want to have a situation where we flood and overwhelm the ambulance services (especially not the SCDF 995 one) and the hospital A&E’s with 90% incorrect suspicions. Plus, the last place you want to be at is the ER during any illness outbreak, unless you have no other choice but to be there. 
Unless you have recently returned from Wuhan, or know someone who did and you have been in close contact with him/her, the likelihood of having contracted it is still low, at least as of now. So please DON’T PANIC. 

** Also, just a friendly reminder to all that, when you are sick, even if it’s flu symptoms that are causing you to worry about the Wuhan virus, or viral gastroenteritis etc, please, wear a surgical mask no matter where you are, even when you’re at home, so as to prevent any viruses from spreading from you to others. Seek medical treatment promptly, and stay home until you are well. 

This is how we can help to contain this situation (or any sort of airborne viruses, in fact) and prevent it from spreading."

I understand people are probably thinking ""Oh My gosh! They halted all transportation""  But as a Public health statistician - this is ""By the book"" primary response - stop the mode of transmission which for Coronavirus is mainly by ""Air"" stopping transport and limiting everyone in their homes reduces the spread of the virus and most importantly ""ISOLATES"" all virus within their infected location which allows officials to easily identify, isolate, quarantine, and treat the infected.  

So I would just wish people would stop amping up how bad it is or ""I wonder what else the Chinese government is hiding"".  This is basic, by-the-book emergency protocol.  They did the same thing with SARS in 2002 a month after they discovered SARS coronavirus spreads by air - all schools were closed until further notice, citizens are advised to limit traveling, transportation is reduced.

Traveling is far more efficient and affordable compared to the 1900s. Especially with the current Coronavirus and the celebration of Chinese New Year, millions of Chinese are constantly moving domestically and internationally. It takes one sick guy to ride a train, coughing on kids going to school, covering his mouth with his hand, grabbing another pole to prevent falling, transfer onto a plane, locked in for hours with 300 other passengers, continuously coughing, gets to destination, waiting for his luggage, coughing with his hand over mouth, grabs wrong luggage, takes another shuttle bus with bunch of strangers, walking in Manhattan to find Times Square, and he reads his departure city is the source of new virus outbreak on a 60 feet jumbo screen, and he’s still coughing."

Current mortality rates for Coronavirus appear to be 35%, and AFAIK those were mostly the elderly. First world healthcare system are more than capable of keeping people alive while their bodies off the virus.

Ebola in the US has a mortality rate of 2 deaths out of 11 infections. 18% for a virus that usually has a mortality of 25 -90%

The CDC also doesn't take any chances with these types of pandemics. They understand that our best chance to beat the pandemic is prevention, not treatment. Our healthcare system can easily manage these diseases, however if the number of infections increase it can easily go beyond their control. Identification, monitoring, quarantine, and rapid treatment of those identified is the name of the game. 

I'm not sure how much is actually known about this virus but I have heard that incubation can be weeks (time it takes to get sick) but you are also contagious during this time (infecting other people but you don't realize you are sick). This is all anecdotal so we will understand in time.

Have faith in your healthcare system, we are standing on the shoulders of giants."

The Ministry of Health  (MoH) last night clarified that messages spread through the social media  about a foreign patient suspected of having H1N1 or Coronavirus  infection receiving treatment at Raja Isteri Pengiran Anak Saleha  (RIPAS) Hospital are not true and have been distributed by irresponsible  parties. About the picture of a Chinese patient that went viral on  social media, the MoH has confirmed that the visitor has been examined  at RIPAS Hospital and sent to the National Isolation Centre for further  examination and precautionary measures, it said in a statement.

Currently, the patient is  in stable condition and the MoH is in the process of determining if the  patient has anything to do with the 2019-nCoV from Wuhan, China.

The MoH added and informed  the public that since the news of the 2019-nCoV virus infection was  announced by the World Health Organization on January 7, 2020, the  ministry has increased its vigilance and preparedness to control the  entry of the virus into Brunei Darussalam.

Among the steps taken are to re-introduce  the use of body temperature checks for passengers arriving in the  country via Brunei International Airport, particularly from cities in  China, starting on January 21, 2020; improved implementation of the  Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) in government clinics and hospitals;  and ongoing monitoring and risk assessment of the condition of the  infection worldwide.

The MoH also explained that  according to the current Standard Operating Procedure, anyone showing  signs of influenza infection such as fever, cough and shortness of  breath, especially those with a history of travel to China, will be  taken to RIPAS Hospital for further examination. This is also a routine  procedure for any sick passenger upon arrival in Brunei Darussalam.

The public is advised not  to be alarmed by the transmission of such pictures or information. The  Ministry of Health also advised the public not to be influenced by news  being spread over the Internet or through other media such as WhatsApp,  Twitter and Facebook without confirming its authenticity.

Furthermore, the public is  warned to be more responsible and not to disseminate any information  that is not verified by the ministry.

The act of distributing  unauthorised information, let alone falsely and deliberately by those  who intend to mislead is an offence and may be reported under the Public  Order Act, Chapter 148 of Section 34, whereby anyone either verbally or  in writing or using any means, disseminating false reports or making  false statements, resulting in anxiety among the public is punishable by  three years’ imprisonment and a fine of BND3,000.

For more information, the public can visit the Ministry of Health’s website www.moh.gov.bn or contact Darussalam line 123."

> After Sars - the severe acute respiratory syndrome in 2002-3 caused by a very similar coronavirus to the one currently in China - there was a temporary ban on the wild animal markets.

> &quot;We later published many papers and popular science articles, urging everyone to stop eating wild animals and not to have too close contact with wild animals.

While it's true it was a lot higher in many parts of the world, it was highly variable, and according to this article, [the UK had a mortality rate around 2%](https://news.yahoo.com/chinas-coronavirus-has-the-same-death-rate-as-the-spanish-flu-pandemic-that-killed-50-m-people-151608803.html).

Which, by the way, would still be way, *way* deadlier than even a worse than normal flu outbreak. If just 25% of the US population were infected - at that rate, *1.7 million people would die.* So that's still very bad."

I work as a critical care registered nurse, and I've been trying to keep up on all the coronavirus news and updates, but I'm just wondering if anyone can shed a little more light on this topic for me.   The gentleman who's in Washington State infected with the virus has apparently only been interacted with via use of a robot.  This seems so incredibly extreme and unnecessary, which is why I feel like maybe I'm missing some vital information regarding this virus.  From what I gather, this is no more contagious or serious than the flu or pneumonia, with similar ages and patient populations being at the greatest risk (very young or very old, immunocompromised, people with multiple comorbidities, etc.).  In my mind, the proper PPE would be a surgical mask, but from many of the news sources, I'm seeing medical staff wearing gear similar to what you would wear if dealing with an Ebola patient.  I also feel like the reason that the virus is spreading so much in China, is that they're leaving these patients as part of the general patient population, instead of immediately placing them on isolation precautions, thus infecting other patients, staff and visitors.  Maybe it's not common practice in other countries, but we automatically place patients on isolation precautions for any potentially infectious ailment (c.diff, flu, tb, etc) until we receive lab confirmation of infection or confirmation that they're not infected.  I would love some advice or information regarding all of this.  I feel like I may be taking this whole outbreak a little too lightly, but the news outlets aren't really giving me the information I'm looking for.  Thanks in advance!"

Beta CoVs are believed to be associated with cytokine storms but its not 100% clear if the individual's immune system was overly-triggered in response by a particularly virulent variation or if it was simply the base virus that *caused* the immune system to be over-triggered.

&#x200B;

>Human coronaviruses (hCoVs) can be divided into low pathogenic and highly pathogenic coronaviruses. The low pathogenic CoVs infect the upper respiratory tract and cause mild, cold-like respiratory illness. In contrast, highly pathogenic hCoVs such as severe acute respiratory syndrome CoV (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome CoV (MERS-CoV) predominantly infect lower airways and cause fatal pneumonia. Severe pneumonia caused by pathogenic hCoVs is often associated with rapid virus replication, massive inflammatory cell infiltration and elevated pro-inflammatory cytokine/chemokine responses resulting in acute lung injury (ALI), and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).   
>  
>...  
>  
> The clinical course of SARS presents in three distinct phases. The initial phase was characterized by robust virus replication accompanied by fever, cough, and other symptoms, all of which subsided in a few days. The second clinical phase was associated with high fever, hypoxemia, and progression to pneumonia-like symptoms, despite a progressive decline in virus titers towards the end of this phase. During the third phase, ∼20% of patients progressed to ARDS, which often resulted in death. Because of a progressive decline in virus titers, the third phase is thought to have resulted from exuberant host inflammatory responses.   
>  
>...  
>  
> The majority of MERS patients with dyspnea progress to develop severe pneumonia and require admission to an intensive care unit (ICU). Although most healthy individuals present with mild-moderate respiratory illness, immunocompromised and individuals with comorbid conditions experience severe respiratory illness, which often progressed to ARDS. Overall, MERS-CoV caused severe disease in primary index cases, immunocompromised individuals and in patients with comorbid conditions, but secondary cases of household contacts or healthcare workers were mostly asymptomatic or showed mild respiratory illness.   
>  
>...  
>  
>Despite several years of research, specific factors causing the unusually high morbidity and mortality following pathogenic hCoVs are incompletely understood. Virus-induced direct cytopathic effects and viral evasion of host immune responses are believed to play major roles in disease severity. However, studies from humans who died of SARS and more recent studies in animal models suggested that a dysregulated immune response occurred, resulting in an exuberant inflammation and lethal disease.

Blood Group Types in Infection and Host Susceptibility 

""Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is caused by the SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV), an RNA virus. The original SARS outbreak in the winter of 2002 to 2003 infected >8,000 individuals worldwide, with a fatality rate of 10% (292). Like other human coronaviruses, SARS-CoV infects the mucosal epithelium, causing an acute respiratory illness often accompanied by gastroenteritis. In a Hong Kong outbreak, there was an apparent association between disease transmission and ABO type (293). An epidemiology study of 34/45 hospital workers who contracted SARS after exposure to a single index patient showed that most of the infected individuals (23/34) were non-group O individuals (groups A, B, and AB). Group O individuals were relatively resistant to infection, with an OR of 0.18 (95% CI, 0.04 to 0.81; P = 0.03).""

Based on this paper, the Novel Coronavirus shares 86.9% of its nucleotide sequence with a bat SARS-like Coronavirus, so not really the SARS virus we saw in the past. That being said, based purely on percentages, it should behave similar to SARS, but that 13% difference could cause changes in tranrsmittability (which we've seen) and lethality (which we've seen, but based on China's sketchiness, we cannot be so sure). 

Minor changes in a gene-coding sequence or a regulatory sequence can cause massive changes in how the virus acts, and while we have the SARS genome sequenced out, I'm not sure if they have figured out which genes have been changed in the novel coronavirus. Even then, other then the viruses surface protein expression, we probably would not be able to elucidate what these changes would actually do in the virus in a laboratory setting for awhile."

2019-NCoV

But that is a placeholder. When it is officially designated it will change from NCoV (novel/new cvirus) to HCoV (human cvirus) but the rest of the designation is up for grabs. I agree with the other poster WARS is bad for googling but who knows ... Could just end up HCoV-2019 although that doesn't fit either pattern.

If his case of coronavirus is confirmed, authorities will release a list of where he has been since becoming infectious. Obviously a worst case scenario is that he was on campus the first days of classes and sick or that he was in a big grocery store and sick. 

Now, the thing about coronavirus (and Wuhan corona in particular)  is that they are not *extremely* infectious. The Wuhan corona is “more infectious than most” in that they think it can be spread in approx a 3 ft radius. I cant find the link now (of course as I scour the internet for it) but they first thought that it could only be spread through kissing, and then they realized otherwise. While this sounds super scary, the flu is much more infectious than they believe the coronavirus is. The scary thing about the coronavirus is that it is spread through respiratory droplets and contact with mucous membranes. Think someone coughing on you. This makes it more infectious than a lot of the other serious diseases we follow these days and is why there’s a lot of public fear about it.

Frankly, I wouldn’t freak out. Don’t let people cough on you, wear a mask if you’re super concerned though they’re not super helpful, and try to stay away from obviously sick people. Also WASH YOUR HANDS PROPERLY (30s, sing happy birthday twice, get the fronts and the backs, lots of soap) and carry around purell or other hand sanitizer. The rule for hand sanitizer is that it needs to keep your hands damp for 5-10 seconds so you have to apply more than you think

(Also I want to note that there was also a suspected case of coronavirus in NJ, and that has since been clarified to not be corona)"

> BEIJING - The Chinese city of Wuhan is rapidly building a new 1,000-bed hospital to treat victims of a new coronavirus, mobilising machinery to get it ready by early next week, state media said.

> The new hospital is being built around a holiday complex originally intended for local workers, set in gardens by a lake on the outskirts of the city, the official Changjiang Daily reported on Friday.

> The hospital aims to copy the experience of Beijing in 2003, when the city battled severe acute respiratory syndrome.

Coronaviruses are very similar to Influenza viruses in terms of how they cause disease, how they are spread and even which animals store the virus. They are usually not as strong in causing illness like influenza though. Less virulent (less dangerous) forms of the virus are constantly in circulation and are responsible for a lot of colds. The big issue is when a new enzootic jump occurs, which is when a new form of the virus moves from infecting animals to infecting humans. Much like swine flu and bird flu (both of which were influenza) jumped from pigs and birds respectively, it is believed this coronavirus originated from a mammal, but research is still ongoing to determine this. 

There are 2 problems with why enzootic jumps like this can be so severe, one for coronavirus in particular and one more generally. 

1. Coronaviruses usually infect the upper respiratory tract and use receptors (think protein locks to the cells) in this part of the respiratory tract to get into cells. More virulent (dangerous) strains infect the lower respiratory tract causing more serious disease and potentially pneumonia

2. As it is a new virus, it hasn't had time to adapt to the new host, nor has the new host had time to adapt to it. Viruses don't want to kill really quickly or easily as it stops the host being able to pass on the virus. As time progresses, the virus is pushed to be less dangerous as it allows itself to keep going better, as a dead person is no use to it.


This is the same family of virus that caused the SARS outbreak in the early 2000s, which was also the result of one of these enzootic jumps. At this stage it doesn't appear it will be as severe as SARS, but is still a health concern nontheless."

For one, none of those supplements has been proven to do anything related to the immune system. Zinc can alleviate symptoms of the commom cold - and that's dubious at best. This is misinformation with no scientific basis or evidence. It can give people a false sense of security, and can shift the focus away from other things that actually do work, which is dangerous.

The coronavirus is a virus, and is spread similarly to viral pneumonia - through droplets. It's not airborne. Wear a generic mask, wash your hands after being in public, and don't bite your nails or touch your mouth. Or better yet, stay out of crowded areas if possible. That's the best possible advice to avoid catching this. Don't waste money on supplements that are nothing more that a placebo."

Depending on who you speak to, this is going to wipe out the world's population, or at the very least kill millions of people. 

I have no medical background, but given social media's leverage effect, i would bet a beer on the reality being a lot less severe than this. The Washington Post (which is reasonably seen as objective among international media outlets) reported today ""*The people who died were between ages 48 and 89, but the vast majority  were at the top of that range and almost all of them had existing health  conditions. Only two of the deaths occurred outside of the epicenter of  Hubei province, of which Wuhan is the capital.*"" (Source: [https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/coronavirus-china-wuhan-latest/2020/01/23/2dc947a8-3d45-11ea-afe2-090eb37b60b1\_story.html](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/coronavirus-china-wuhan-latest/2020/01/23/2dc947a8-3d45-11ea-afe2-090eb37b60b1_story.html)

Again, this could get worse... but normal pneumonia would tend to kill older people with existing health conditions. China's reaction of shutting down public events and quarantining cities is perfectly rational, given the absolute number of older people with existing health conditions. Without tempting fate, as a younger person with no existing health conditions, i'm less concerned than others. 

Does this mean that foreign nationals should get the fuck out of China? This alone, probably not. But everything else that has happened recently, you'd need a good reason to stay. Me personally, i'm out of here when my current contracts ends in the summer and will not be back."

It seems like at worst, it's killing people who are weak and susceptible to death (such as from the seasonal flu), and as someone else pointed out, the symptoms are basically like those of the cold or regular flu, many people probably have it but haven't gone to the doctor because it's almost indistinguishable unless your case is extremely severe.

I'm pretty sure this entire scare is just that: a scare. China is wise to try and prevent the spread of the disease just as far as damage control goes, since there's no vaccine and they couldn't have been aware early on how serious this might be, but based on what's happened so far it seems like it's not that serious. Maybe it's a bit deadlier than seasonal flu, which has a low fatality percentage but also infects many many millions of people every year (and thus kills many tens of thousands in the USA alone every year), at worst. At best, it will be contained and we'll develop a vaccine before too long."

An outbreak of the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) was initially identified during mid-December 2019 in the city of Wuhan in central China, as an emerging cluster of people with pneumonia with no clear cause, which was linked primarily to stallholders who worked at the Huanan Seafood Market, which also sold live animals. Chinese scientists subsequently isolated a new strain of coronavirus – given the initial designation of 2019-nCoV – which has been found to be at least 70 percent similar in genome sequence to SARS-CoV. With the development of a specific diagnostic PCR test for detecting the infection, a number of cases were confirmed in people directly linked to the market and in those who were not directly associated with it. Whether this virus is of the same severity or lethality as SARS is unclear.On 20 January 2020, Chinese premier Li Keqiang urged decisive and effective efforts to prevent and control the pneumonia epidemic caused by a novel coronavirus. As of 24 January 2020, 26 deaths have occurred, all in China, and there is evidence of human-to-human transmission.

This Coronavirus has only infected something like 1000 people- and that's only the ones who got sick enough to seek medical treatment. There could be many more who just thought they had the flu and gutted it or, or sought help and were misdiagnosed. Of the victims we know for sure have it, the virus has only managed to kill 30 or so.

I'm not trying to lessen the tragedy of the deaths of the victims or the pain of their families. But as it is right now, Coronavirus is not the plague that's going end humanity. It will do its thing and then fade into obscurity like all the others before it. 

Believe me, when the next slate-wiper does show up (*and we're overdue*) we won't have to ask ""is this the bad one."" Cities of millions will be dead in a matter of days, and billions across the globe in the weeks and months following. Society - *as we know it* \- will be fundamentally changed, just as it was when the Black Death ravaged the Old World centuries ago. By the time it was done with Europe, there wasn't a person alive who hadn't lost most, if not all, of their whole family and community to it... 

Yet, we're still here. We survived the last slate-wiper in a time before we had modern medicine, good nutrition, sewage/waste management, clean water, and proper hygiene. We will survive the next one. Humans are much harder to kill than we give ourselves credit for. Some scientists estimate that we've come back from numbers as low 3,000 humans, total, on the planet. It's natural disasters like super volcanoes that will kill us out completely, not a virus."

Sure, this title makes it seem really bad.  People are being infected faster than expected.  Naturally that's a cause for concern.  But it's also hard to tell just how serious it is.

Best I have found online, the symptoms are just kind of cold/flu like.  Sore throat, fever, things like this.  It seems that the people who have died were older people and were already sick with something else (and I am guessing this weakened their immune system enough to kill them).

Anyway, I'm just trying to gauge the level of sensationalism here.  Obviously any unknown illness spreading is cause for concern, but it doesn't seem to be an especially dangerous sickness (just from the articles I've read).  Not that anybody would want to catch an disease of any kind, but it seems that if a healthy person DID catch this, they are likely to be just fine after the symptoms subside and the immune system ultimately wins.

Imagine that you have a city of 100,000 people with 5 known infections. Does it make more sense to try to monitor everybody in the population and prevent them from going anywhere? Or does it make more sense to concentrate your resources on the 5 known cases and the 10 people each of them know, plus broadcasting how to prevent transmission?

That said, theater is not useless - maybe your goal is to reinforce confidence in the government or whatever. But if the goal is preventing further infections, it's not a great use of finite resources, both in terms of money and in human cost to the medical responders."

The hospitals are now stuffed with panicked worried well mixed with Coronavirus carriers, that's helping to increase the R0.

Also, on a slightly positive note, the given only 1 in 20 go to hospital, only the sickest are admitted to hospital and the true lethality rate may be a lot lower.

2020-01-24,IchbineinSmazak,China,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/China/comments/et8v9v/dont_buy_the_media_hype_over_the_new_china_virus/ffeslrd/,"A CNN reporter broadcasts from Wuhan, China, on the recent viral outbreak. There is nobody near who could possibly infect him ­— unless the cameraman has Guinness Book of Records coughs and sneezes. So why does he insist on wearing a blue surgical mask while talking?

It’s called “drama,” which is badly needed, because there appears to be nothing very special about this outbreak of the 2019-nCoV or Wuhan ­virus. It should actually be called the DvV, or Déjà vu Virus, because we have been through these hysterias before. Over and over. Heterosexual AIDS, Ebola repeatedly, the H1N1 swine flu that was actually vastly milder than the regular flu and, especially, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) in 2003.

Once you start debunking mass hysteria over outbreaks, it gets easy, because the same patterns repeat themselves.

The best remedy for all epidemic hysteria is perspective. How is this new outbreak different and thus potentially more dangerous from other diseases we have dealt with in the past or are dealing with now?

Wuhan is repeatedly labeled “deadly” — but so is every other ­virus most people know about. But especially deadly? Nearly 600 cases have been confirmed with at least 17 reported deaths.

An infected American is reportedly doing well. It’s probably true that the death toll is understated, but it’s guaranteed the infection number is. Probably as with, say, flu, the vast majority of those infected have such slight symptoms they don’t seek medical attention.

For that reason, a comparison to the US flu death rate is also very difficult. As a share of hospitalizations, the regular flu death rate is 8.5 percent to 17 percent, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention — considerably higher than for Wuhan. But counting all ­estimated illnesses, reported and estimated, it’s much lower.

What we can say for sure is that Wuhan will be a lot worse in China, simply because health care there is vastly inferior. It appears that, like flu, Wuhan usually kills through ­often treatable secondary infections. Well, treatable in the West. You’d be surprised at how many potentially deadly diseases ­(malaria, TB) Americans get that wreak havoc in much of the world but kill essentially none of us.

It also appears those most likely to die of Wuhan-virus deaths fit the same profile as flu fatalities: people over 65, those with compromised immune systems and those with serious pre-existing conditions. Two of the 17 Wuhan dead were 89-year-olds with pre-existing conditions; the youngest was 48 and suffering from diabetes and a stroke.

Contagiousness is highly important, of course. But so far, there is no evidence that Wuhan, first reported more than three weeks ago, is more contagious than ­influenza or spreads differently.

Those are the important factors; everything else is noise and tinfoil-hat paranoia.

We are breathlessly told it’s spread from human to human. Again, most of the contagious diseases we think of are spread ­between humans, with some ­exceptions, such as rabies.

It’s inherently bad because it’s new, we’re told. So were swine flu and SARS.

Chinese health officials warned it could mutate further to either become more deadly or more contagious. Same was said about the aforementioned outbreaks. Actually, viruses usually mutate to become less deadly, to preserve the host body and hence themselves.

The media are correct in saying the closest comparison here is SARS. It also was first reported in China and was what’s called a coronavirus. But while they want you to remember SARS as akin to the Black Death with cries of “bring out your dead!,” fact is, there was a grand total of only 8,098 cases, of whom 774 died. Then the disease simply disappeared. More than 7,000 of those cases and about 650 of the deaths occurred just in Mainland China and Hong Kong. The United States had just 75 cases and zero deaths.

By contrast, the CDC estimates about 80,000 Americans died of flu two seasons ago.

So if you want, buy a (probably worthless) surgical mask to play “twins” with those “courageous” TV newsmen. Or you may consider that flu shots are still available."

Maybe this isn't the exact sub for this type of question, but I'll go as far as what I know. 

Cornaviruses are a family of viruses, just like influenza. With the flu, you've got your HxNx combos and a few others (I think). Cornaviruses come in forms as benign as the common cold or as deadly as SARS or MERS (10% and 30% mortality respectively). One of the many issues with this is that viruses can be unpredictable and may be prone to mutation so whenever a pathogen crosses the species barrier (as coronavirus does) and it's possible to transmit from person-person, it's quite concerning.  The cornavirus we're heading about now has been deemed ""Novel Cornavirus"" or ""N-CoV"". 

In terms of symptoms, what I'm getting from it is that the illness is more likely to progress to a severe infection deeper within the lungs, having a cough is one thing but having it progress to a deadly pneumonia is another.  

I'm not a doctor or a scientist but I love pandemics (from a distance). I would love to hear more about the differences between an early CoV infection and the flu.

Simple. 

We are in Thailand and with the lunar new year holiday, we have a lot of Chinese tourists. We also happen to have a high amount of confirmed cases.

There is a Ministry of Health directive that recommends that people travelling in airports should wear masks in order to prevent the spread through respiration. 

We have a lot of travellers. >50% are from China.

It would look rude if we wore masks, but I don’t want to be infected, neither do I want the staff. 

The only downside I see is that we would look unprofessional, especially us front desk staff.

So WIBTA if I let my front desk staff and myself wear respiratory masks due to the recent coronavirus?

When people have either common illness, and they hear on the news about a disease with a reported fatality rate of 5%, they’ll head to the hospital. That 5% figure will likely change since we generally can only derive that figure from A) the infected that actually go to the hospital, which excludes the potentially large numbers of sick people who stay home and recover and B) confirmed cases.

So you’ve got a lot of sick people, infected with or without the Wuhan coronavirus, all sitting in the waiting rooms together. With an incubation period that is possibly greater than a week, you’ve got all those people that now have to be isolated and monitored, greatly stretching resources.

With diagnostics limited in the early stage, the number of cases is practically unknowable. 

What is known is that diseases like this that jump to humans are sometimes far more lethal than the common cold or season flu. But how contagious is it? That’ll dictate if this is another SARs or MERs, or something else entirely.

I do think China has come a long ways since SARs, but the disparity between their population and health care resources is too vast for a contagious disease to be curtailed effectively. Quarantine and monitoring/isolating all contacts is paramount... assuming the resources can keep up. Once contacts cannot be followed up, then only quarantining remains... hence the city shutdowns."

This strain of virus is a mutated version of other virus’ and quite similar to SARS. 
Other versions of Coronavirus are common in cats and horses. It is known that whist the virus can not survive on a hard flat surface for more a few hours it has been known to survive in carpet and fabric for up to 7 weeks. 

With that noted it is wise to wash your hauls in as hot as water as possible once received and dry immediately. Also wash your hands after handling. 

Finally also note that the mortality rate of SARS is around 10%. Although this new strain is still a bit of an unknown it is deemed to be less deadly than SARS therefore nearly everyone should recover fine. People with other underlying heath issues need worry slightly more but currently it’s a relatively low risk."

I think the important thing to keep in mind is that if there is ever a risk of diseases being transferred between wild game to humans, it will be taken very seriously in the US and the necessary precautions will be taken immediately. The last I read they think that the coronavirus came from snakes, although I didn't read if they were alive or being butchered and sold for meat (it sounds like both were being carried out in the market) and the market was not immediately shut down after they learned of the origin site. This would never happen in the US, there are very few (if any) markets where you would ever see live animals being sold alongside those that have already been processed for food.

True, it is highly infectious. But lethality is so low --- almost all ppl dying from it are old-aged ppl with other diseases, the group of ppl who often die from cold and cough. And there are plenty reports of recovery already. So statistically-wise, so far it is not more dangerous than a common flu --- just rest at home for a few days will do.

Any potential production halt in China is almost impossible. They can easily wear masks during work. And it is China, the country that did not even stop back in SARS time  (which was far more lethal) or virtually anytime.

Where? At an open air fish and meat market. Anyone looking into contaminated flesh at the market? Dangerous lack of sanitation? They’re looking into “the virus.” Naturally. 

>And as I keep saying in past and recent articles, we have a massive tradition of FAKE EPIDEMICS.

>You have to understand: most people don’t want to hear this. It’s rather astonishing. Most people feel compelled to believe in the virus, believe it’s dangerous, it’s a killer, it’s real, it’s a global threat. Pro-vaccine people, anti-vaccine people, it doesn’t matter. They salute THE VIRUS.

>[In my last article](https://blog.nomorefakenews.com/2020/01/22/is-the-new-deadly-china-virus-a-covert-operation/), I detailed how former “epidemics,” SARS (coronavirus) and Swine Flu, turned out to be complete fakes. Eventually, it leaked out that medical experts couldn’t find the virus in people. You should really read that article, and read it again. And think about the implications.

>Medical research honchos and the press are still calling the 2003 SARS dud an epidemic. Official stats indicate 800 people died, worldwide. If that’s an epidemic, there are pink tigers walking around on the far side of the moon.

>Now, when they talk about rushing a vaccine into production “against the virus,” that’s a whole different story. They tried that in 2009 with Swine Flu, and it caused profound and horrific results. I’ve read the patent info that’s now circulating on the Web—for a vaccine against a coronavirus. It’s hard to tell, but it could be a DNA vaccine. If it is, that means the vaccine will permanently alter the genetic makeup of anyone who takes the shot.

>Here’s something else you should think about. The so-called origin points of epidemics. SARS (2003), the Amoy Gardens apartment complex in Hong Kong. Swine Flu (2009), a giant commercial pig farm in La Gloria, Mexico. And now, in 2020, the Chinese coronavirus, an open air animal and fish market in Wuhan.

>At the Amy Gardens complex, there were leaks in the pipes. Human waste was leaking. People were falling ill. My, what a surprise. They needed to call in a plumber, not the World Health Organization virus hunters.

>At the pig farm, in La Gloria, huge feces lagoons, yes, were lying there out in the sun. The lagoons were routinely sprayed with toxic chemicals. Workers were falling ill. What a shock. So they brought in people to spray even more toxic chemicals on the pig shit lagoons. They needed a major environmental clean-up. Instead, they got World Health and CDC virus hunters.

>And now, in Wuhan, the virus hunters are at it again. They want to test the animal flesh at the market for viruses. Here are a few recommendations. Check the water supply in the market. Is it dirty? Check the refrigeration. Are the fish and animal meat always fresh? Is the place clean? Is it washed down well every day? Actually LOOK at the premises. I know, it’s a revolutionary act, but steel yourself and go ahead.

>“Yes, but what about the other cases of the China coronavirus that have been identified in other countries? Where did they come from?”

>Answer: How do you know these other cases are a result of the coronavirus? The symptoms in most of these fake epidemics are the same—they’re basic flu symptoms—fatigue, fever, cough, weakness. A person could come down with THAT for a hundred different reasons.

>I started writing about viruses that were never proved to cause human illness—or weren’t even there to begin with—in 1987. All these years later, I find myself still doing it. Why?

>**BECAUSE ‘THE VIRUS” IS THE GREATEST COVER STORY ON THE PLANET. IT ATTRACTS BELIEVERS FROM WALL TO WALL.**

>Professionals invoke it to cover up a multitude of crimes.

>For example, in parts of Africa, where the water supplies are contaminated to the hilt, where people are hungry and dying of starvation, where people have chronic diarrhea and are dying from dehydration, where extreme poverty and war for economic gain are routine, where corporate interests are stealing farm land from the people and poisoning the environment, where toxic medical drugs and vaccines are killing people whose immune systems are already compromised—you can ignore all that because…the real problem, the one serious problem, you see, is:

>**THE VIRUS.**

>Sure. Pump up that story to the max, get medical testimony, research money, the whole insane apparatus, and paint over what is actually happening there, and you’re in. You’re in control. You’re king.

>Believe in the virus. Pray to the virus. Fear the virus."

People were out at markets without masks, ""preparing to ring in the New Year in peace and had no sense about the epidemic,"" Guan Yi of the University of Hong Kong's State Key Laboratory of Emerging Infectious Diseases told Caixin. Airports were hardly being disinfected, Guan continued, saying the local government hasn't ""even been handing out quarantine guides to people who were leaving the city.""

The city did disinfect the market where the virus has been traced to, but Guan criticized Wuhan for that, saying it hurts researchers' abilities to track down the virus's source. ""I've never felt scared,"" Guan told Caixin. ""This time I'm scared.""

That equation is refered to as ""Calculus of Negligence"" and I think it pretty much applies to Shanghai Disney closing down. The cost of shutting down the parks, refunding prepaid vacation packages, plus likely doing something to retain those guests, must be phenomenal. Therefore, China MUST BE DOWN PLAYING THE CORONAVIRUS. Disney would never make this huge decision if this wasn't something extreme. 

You can read more about the scene from FC and CoN below if you would like. 


In the film Fight Club, among the depths of monologue and conversation, the Narrator explains to another airline passenger how his employer, a major car company, goes about initiating a recall. The exact quote is: 


Narrator: A new car built by my company leaves somewhere traveling at 60 mph. The rear differential locks up. The car crashes and burns with everyone trapped inside. Now, should we initiate a recall? Take the number of vehicles in the field, A, multiply by the probable rate of failure, B, multiply by the average out-of-court settlement, C. A times B times C equals X. If X is less than the cost of a recall, we don't do one.

So boiling it down, there are the four variables.

A. Number of vehicles (# of Guests + Cast Members)

B. Probable rate of failure (Probable Rate of Contamination)

C. Average out-of-court settlement (Potential Law Suits/Damage to Brand)

X. Cutoff number for a recall (Cost of Park Closure)


Following the narrator's math, X<A*B*C
 or 
Closure<People in Park*Contamination Probability*Quantifiable Costs


Sounds terrible and mathematical right? If a business does this, we should boycott their clearly unethical behavior, right? Well, legally, this is not only ethical, but legal and expected behavior from any person. 


Welcome, to the wonderful world of negligence law. In particular, the formula the narrator describes is a rephrased version of the (""Calculus of Negligence"")[https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calculus_of_negligenceor]
 Now, lawyer's typically aren't good at math, so leave it to them to make a very basic Algebraic formula ""Calculus."" Here there are three variables:


B. Burden of taking Precaution

P. Probability

L. Loss


Applied, this formula comes out as B<P*L or Burden<Probability*Loss.


 Starting to look familiar? That's because this is the same formula the narrator rattled off. The probability multiplied by the number of the cars in the field gives you the total probability of loss in the field. The loss in this case is the average settlement, and as (97%)[https://www.bizjournals.com/phoenix/stories/2004/05/31/newscolumn5.html] of cases are settled out of court, using the average out of court settlement is completely fair. "

 Trata-se de uma mulher na faixa dos 60 anos que mora em Chicago e voltou de Wuhan, na China, onde a epidemia parece ter começado, em 13 de janeiro.

 Hospitalizada para evitar o contágio, ela está clinicamente estável, segundo Allison Arwady, diretora de saúde pública de Chicago, em uma coletiva de imprensa.

 O primeiro caso havia sido confirmado na última segunda-feira (21), em Washington. O paciente, que foi hospitalizado com pneumonia na semana passada, também havia viajado recentemente para Wuhan, na China.

 Os investigadores testaram amostras do paciente em busca do vírus e os resultados positivos para a infecção foram recebidos no fim de semana. Os funcionários se recusaram a identificar o paciente, que estava bastante doente.

  Além dos dois casos confirmados, 11 pessoas avaliadas no país receberam diagnóstico negativo e outros 50 pacientes estão sendo investigados.

 Até esta sexta (24), 830 casos e 26 mortes foram confirmados. Além da China, outros oito países também foram afetados: Taiwan, Tailândia, Japão, Coreia do Sul, Vietnã, Singapura, EUA e Arábia Saudita. 

 As autoridades cancelaram eventos do Ano-Novo chinês para impedir que o vírus se espalhe e[ isolaram cidades da província de Hubei](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/equilibrioesaude/2020/01/china-isola-area-com-40-milhoes-para-conter-coronavirus-26-ja-morreram.shtml), área com cerca de 40 milhões de habitantes.

 Os serviços de transporte público foram totalmente paralisados, afetando pelo menos 13 cidades da região e entorno. O uso de máscaras em prédios públicos se tornou obrigatório e aqueles que desrespeitarem a medida estão sujeitos a responsabilização legal. 

 A China também anunciou nesta sexta o fechamento de trechos da Grande Muralha e de monumentos emblemáticos de Pequim.

 Os túmulos da dinastia Ming e a floresta Yinshan Pagoda serão fechados a partir de sábado. O Estádio Nacional de Pequim, conhecido como Ninho de Pássaro, construído para os Jogos Olímpicos de Pequim em 2008, teve suas portas fechadas hoje.

 Na quinta (23), a OMS (Organização Mundial da Saúde) disse que ainda era[ cedo para declarar uma emergência internacional ](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/equilibrioesaude/2020/01/coronavirus-chines-ainda-nao-e-emergencia-internacional-de-saude-diz-oms.shtml)de saúde pública por causa do coronavírus. Apesar disso, a organização ressalta que o caso é grave e que pode piorar, porque ainda não atingiu seu ápice. 

 ""É uma emergência na China, mas ainda não se tornou uma emergência global. Pode ainda se torna uma"", disse Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, diretor da OMS."

I wasn't asking you a question, I was illustrating the need for passage through human hosts for this virus to evolve. 

The sudden emergence of this virus, as the Chinese authorities tell us, in multiple people around the same time from this market, is peculiar as the virus hasn't even evolved or adapted from one human host to another.  It just jumped to multiple people apparently on the same day, ready made to infect humans. 

If a new virus was created we would expect it to infect one host, then that host infect a few more, and you would have a gradual emergence of this.

We have reason to question the information as presented from the Chinese authorities. 

So that is why the possibility of accidental release from a lab worker could be considered. How do you know that a live bat was the source at this market?

How do you know that a bat-origin coronavirus wasn't cultured in human cells, infected a worker, who then went to the market and sneezed, infecting everyone within 10 feet?

Or that some accidental discharge occurred, the virus entering a water way, tainted sea food, and then spread via the market?"

This specific strain is new but if you've encountered a coronavirus before in your life (which I would guess 95% of the population of the world has) you've already got a leg up on this one. Now if it were to mutate drastically and become something more like it's close relative MERS. That would be extremely concerning. Seeing as MERS has a 35% mortality rate and this strain spread easier. But chances of that happening are slim.

There are plenty of headline news stories that are absolutely meaningless. That being said we should ALWAYS be concerned about and aware of emerging diseases, for a couple of reasons:

1) Mutation. Especially with viruses, the mortality rate could suddenly and unpredictably increase by a factor of ten. As the coronavirus appears to be a zoonotic disease, the more people catch it the more chances it has to become better adapted to human physiology.  

2) Understanding where these things come from. The animal husbandry practices in China are extremely irresponsible. Mixing multiple species of animal together in close quarters, overusing antibiotics, and feeding their remains to each other is exactly what you would do if you wanted to make a bioweapon but were too lazy to design it yourself. This aspect of the Wuhan novel coronavirus needs to be talked about more.  China and other countries with similar practices and ineffectual regulation could very well wipe out civilization. 

3) What could happen. This is where the concept of exponential growth comes in. This is a highly transmissible virus, much more so than ebola. It is at least as good as the common cold, and the common cold does not have a 3% mortality rate. Keep in mind that the 3% mortality rate is among people who are receiving advanced treatment. All this is to say that if the spread of the virus reaches a certain combination of number of infected and geographic spread, things will get very bad very fast. The more people are sick the more people they make sick, and the more infrastructure suffers. The more people are infected the fewer resources are available to treat them effectively, and mortality and transmission goes up. The Spanish flu had a mortality rate of about 10%, and it killed at least 3% of the people on earth at the time because it got out of control.

The point is that any pathogen which can kill or incapacitate can be an existential threat if mismanaged. Right now the world health community is working their asses off to manage it, and most likely nothing much will come of it in the end, just like with all the other examples you mentioned. This does not mean that there was never a threat, it means that we won."

It was the same about the whole WW3 thing a couple of weeks ago. I’m no fan of the Chinese regime and it seems they have handled this horribly.

But I’m seeing lots of hysterical, end of the world nonsense on here. At the moment we don’t really know the mortality rate because we don’t really know how many people are infected. If this is like the other type of Coronavirus’ those affected can range from having a runny nose and a bit of a sore throat to death depending on factors like their health and age. 

People will point towards the fact it is “spreading fast” but is it really? These has hit mainline news very quickly, and if I was a Wuhan resident with a bit of a cold I might be more inclined to go get checked out now than I would have been otherwise. I would say the sharp increase is at least partially due to the amount of people suddenly deciding to get that lingering cold checked out.

The majority of those who have died also seem to have been older people with other ailments already, those same people could have been equally affected by another type of common flu.

It’s something to keep and eye on, China finally seem to be taking it seriously which is good considering we don’t know all the facts - but I do think all the talk of it being a global pandemic need to simmer down."

How do you stop the US from using the World Forest Organization from using it to force better trade deals on Brazil? How do you stop China from declaring 90% of Vietnam as protected jungle to hamper their economic growth?"

In a city of 11mm, you’ll see that type of death happen.

As NCBI will reinforce, Coronavirus has long been linked to adverse events in people with situationally negative genetic predispositions. Blindness and death have both been observed from cov. This was a factor with SARS’ fatality count as well. 

“Young and healthy” is a misnomer in this context. If this were an observed trend across the infected, sure time to worry. But the evidence is overwhelmingly in favor of the opposite and there are plausible explanations for this outlier. 

Using an outlier to draw a different narrative from what the data is saying is irresponsible. We have documented cases of the most at-risk population recovering from this with fluids and rest. 

It’s definitely bad and those cohorts deserve to be treated to the best of the service’s ability, but we are well into fearmongering territory at this point."

At the moment (24-01-2019 8:27 pm UTC) 2.7% of the victims who contracted the virus died ([source](https://gisanddata.maps.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html#/bda7594740fd40299423467b48e9ecf6)). Most of the registered cases (97.6%) are in Mainland China where the government, if I’m not mistaken, is trying as hard as it can to contain the virus. Meanwhile the US had only 2 confirmed cases (1 in Seattle, 1 in Chicago) where the affected people are doing fine and are currently being treated at the hospital. There have been, at the moment of me writing this, no confirmed cases in the UK and EU yet.

Anyway SARS’ case fatality ratio is estimated to be less than 1% in persons aged 24 years or younger, 6% in persons aged 25 to 44 years, 15% in persons aged 45 to 64 years, and greater than 50% in persons aged 65 years and older. ([source](https://www.who.int/csr/sars/archive/2003_05_07a/en/) )
The average Ebola case fatality rate is around 50%. Case fatality rates have varied from 25% to 90% in past outbreaks.([source](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/ebola-virus-disease) )

So, at the moment, the new coronavirus’s fatality rate seems low (2.7%) and until further data is made available we cannot now fatalities rate for different age ranges. Bur it’s still probable older people and people with already serious problem might have a more difficult time fighting the virus.

Anyway if you’d like more information you can visit the [World Health Organization’s page on Coronavirus] (https://www.who.int/health-topics/coronavirus) or the [European Union’s page on Coronavirus](https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/novel-coronavirus-china)"

yes its early days but this virus is being reported on and every littke hint of it is making massive waves in the media. just because someone has it doesnt mean its severe just as with the flu. 

were now just registering people who have it (the one who if it was the flu wouldnt have even presented to a doctor and would have nursed themselves at home)

This case, following the first confirmed case in Washington State, occurred in a Chicago resident who traveled to Wuhan, China, the site of an ongoing outbreak, according to the CDC. 

 

Including the two confirmed positive cases, there are 63 patients under investigation, 11 of whom have tested negative, Dr. Nancy Messonnier, director of the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, said in the telebriefing. These patients come from 22 states. 

 

“While this situation poses a very serious public health threat, CDC believes that the immediate risk to the US Public is low at this time,” Messonnier said in the telebriefing, “but the situation can change to evolve rapidly.”

 

The Chicago resident, a woman in her mid-60s, is hospitalized and in stable condition. Her case poses a low infection risk for the public locally and nationally, Dr. Allison Awrady, Commissioner at Chicago's Department of Public Health, said in the telebriefing.

 

The patient had limited close contacts since returning from China, all of whom will be monitored, and had limited movement outside of her home, Awrady said. Additionally, the patient was not symptomatic while flying. 

 

“Based on what we know about the virus our concern for transmission before symptoms develop is low so that is reassuring,” she said. 

 

The coronavirus is part of a large family of viruses. Patients with the current strain, the 2019 Novel Coronavirus, exhibit “mild to severe respiratory illness” with symptoms including fever, cough and shortness of breath, according to the CDC. Illness has resulted in a number of deaths in China. 

The CDC recommends avoiding all non-essential travel to Wuhan, China and practicing certain health precautions when traveling to other parts of China, such as practicing good hand hygiene and avoiding contacting with people who are sick, Messonnier said in the telebriefing. 

 

It is likely there will be more cases of the coronavirus in the United States. The CDC has an aggressive response with the goal of identifying potential cases early and ensuring patients get the best, most appropriate care, she said in the telebriefing. 

 

While there are many unknowns, CDC believes that the immediate risk to the American public continues to be low at this time, she said. But, the situation continues to evolve rapidly.

 

“We at CDC have out best people working on this problem,” she said. “We have the support of the entirety of the federal government, and we have one of the strongest public health systems in the world.”"

She was moved to the respiratory department, then quarantined. She died on Jan. 12, Xu told Beijing News.

Xu’s father, who had been visiting his wife in the hospital, then grew short of breath. When a scan showed he had a lung infection, doctors told Xu to move him to one of “those” hospitals, she said, referring to the institutions treating patients with coronavirus.

He died Tuesday. Neither of them were tested for the virus. Both, like Chen, were cremated immediately.

Chinese officials try to contain virus outbreak as first case confirmed in U.S.

This outbreak is extremely sensitive for Xi and the ruling Communist Party. Not only is the coronavirus spreading, but it comes on the heels of rising food prices overall and a slowing economy, in the midst of continuing frictions with the United States, and as Beijing faces political challenges in Hong Kong and Taiwan.

That means it could have political ramifications.

“People are getting very angry in Wuhan, but before, it was a local issue,” said Dali Yang, a political scientist at the University of Chicago. “Now that the virus has escaped Wuhan, it has become a national issue. So, given how centralized the system is, Xi has to act decisively and put his imprimatur on this.”

Xi’s involvement could hearten some people, Yang said, and help local leaders ensure social stability. But this could backfire on him if the situation turns out to be worse than thought, or if it has a big economic impact.

Some of this impact may take time to see.

China’s local governments, including Wuhanand surrounding Hubei province, are being crushed by huge debt loads, and the financial toll of this outbreak could push them over the edge.

Beginning early Thursday, all outbound travel was banned from Wuhan, a city of 11 million people, in an unprecedented action by China to try to contain the virus. The People’s Daily, the official newspaper of the Chinese Communist Party, reported that “no people in Wuhan … will be allowed to leave the city.”

Hubei authorities on Wednesday asked the central government for emergency assistance of 40 million surgical masks, 5 million protection suits and 5,000 infrared thermometers.

“If the disease was spread to some of the poor provinces that are heavily indebted, it would mean substantial additional outlays for local governments, especially at the municipal and county level where the budget is really, really strapped,” said Victor Shih, an expert on China’s political economy at the University of California at San Diego.s

That may mean that promised bridges and roads will not be built, he said, adding to percolating discontent about the slowing economy.

“Even if people are unhappy, they’re obviously not going to rise up or anything,” Shih said.

The increasingly iron-fisted Xi, who has scrapped term limits so he can theoretically rule this one-party state for the rest of his life, has put in place strict controls and surveillance to make sure there is no dissent.

“But if the disease continues to spread in China, and if we see clear signs of policy failures to deal with this kind of virus,” Shih said, “I think the educated public will be very disappointed and disillusioned about the effect of concentrating so much power in the hands of one person.”

Wang Yuan, Lyric Li and Liu Yang contributed to this report.

I’d rather have access to all the information to decide for myself then waiting for weeks for experts to validate their analysis.

Also, the “fear mongering” is even worse on Chinese and Hong Kong forums, and that begs the question, if people at the center of the outbreak are so afraid, shouldn’t we at least explore the possibility that the virus might be more severe than just your average flu?


Again, as someone who lived through SARS in Hong Kong, fear is one of the factors that the virus was contained so quickly!

You ask anyone from Hong Kong they will know exactly what to do when ones sick ( wash hands, wear masks, don’t touch face, don’t go to work), I fear people simply don’t have that mindset here in the west.

How many people do you know willingly go to the office when they are sick? Even when they have sick days or can work from home? No one wears masks around here (Chicago)when they are sick. they just don’t have that mindset because they never went through something like this.

If you are right, this coronavirus turns out to be just another common cold, what do we have to lose to have more awareness on epidemics and how to deal with it?

If there was a sudden outbreak of a virus that caused heart disease *immediately* then you better believe that we would take that shit very seriously.  Don’t be ringing the conspiracy alarm bells for everything."

What you call the ""flu"" is actually hundreds of different strains of influenza which has and will continue to infect humans for a very long time. 

This is a new virus which just leapt the species barrier about a month ago. I don't know the correct terminology for this but if you get the flu you will infect 1 other person on average, this Novel coronavirus on average will be transferred to 2-3.3 people per person infected.

The mortality rate for the common flu was about 0.1% in the last flu season whereas this Corona virus has about a 3% mortality rate, that is a difference of 30X, if this virus becomes as widespread as influenza, which is the fear here we would see a staggering number of deaths we would see over 1 Million deaths in the U.S. alone.

Quoting statistics doesn't mean anything if you don't have the knowledge to understand them.

The statistics I am quoting are coming out of China so it's safe to say they may be underrepresented due to many factors such as hospitals in affected areas being to full to test or accept new patients, people not going to hospitals when they are sick and Chinas track record of suppression of information."

Did you know 30,000 people die every year in the UK from influenza? 50,000 in the US? God knows how many in China - hundreds of thousands? Seems unlikely that this coronavirus is gonna come anywhere near the death toll of viruses / diseases that are already present. They're saying it's weaker than SARS, which caused a total of 800 deaths - a drop in the water compared to annual flu deaths.

Even if I got it I still wouldn't be worried, as I'm not elderly and don't have any serious pre-existing health issues.

The wall to wall coverage in western media is just another means of undermining China in my opinion, just like their obsessive reporting on the Hong Kong protests while protests in other countries, eg Bolivia, are ignored. They pick and choose news stories to promote the status quo and stir up antipathy towards challengers to US / western hegemony.

Not trying to defend China but you really have to wary of all China related narratives these days."

The second video is more like a car accident, since there is a car parking in the middle of the road right next to the ambulance and there is a man holding a helmet in company with the patient, which means there is also a motorbike or a electric bike involved (you don't need a helmet to drive a car, right?) The reason why the doctors are wearing hazard suits is because they don't know if the patient is infected with this coronavirus. There was a patient who was in hospital for a brain surgery, but he is also a virus carrier and 10 doctors and nurses are infected because of him. So now doctors are treating every patient as a potential virus carrier."

-Do not mock (translation do not criticize authoritarian regime)

-Pray for us as we pray for you (Support the authoritarian regime)

All of this was said only to help the image of the authoritarian Chinese government. WTF.  

We will continues to openly criticize the Chinese government whenever necessary and especially now that a combination of “traditional Chinese medecine” (literary regime sanctioned freshly made-up esoteric malarkey to boast-up cultural attachment) and the intrinsic insalubrious markets (kept this way to please the population to prevent revolution) are major causes of this outbreak. 

And we will blur the line between criticism and mocking as much as we deem necessary for humiliation is a formidable weapon against tyranny. 

Like don’t you think that if the government didn’t (through cultural propaganda of “Traditional Chinese Medecine” ) lead Chinese peasants to believe their dicks would get bigger by eating aphrodisiac bush meat delicacies, this whole thing could’ve been prevented ? 

Maybe if the Chinese government didn’t absolutely needed meat to keep their oppressed people happy, they wouldn’t have resorted to let the oppressed buy filthy meat sources when they had to slaughter so many pigs because of (again) insalubrious conditions. 

Hey at least the Wuhan coronavirus give us a break from talking about Hong Kong invasion right ? What’s your astro take on that astroboy ? Do not mock China’s invasion of Honk Kong because people died (again at te hand of the authoritarian regime that is the Chinese government) ? 

How about if the Chinese government didn’t stop buying Canadian pork (and Canola oil) in a retaliatory measure against the plausible extradition of that Huawei CFO, maybe the people wouldn’t have needed as much bush meat to compensate ?

If we can’t criticize, if we can’t mock, then nothing will change. So fuck the Chinese government, fuck your blatant astroturfing and fuck your fat complicit mom too."

Last week many people on this thread were angry that some experts claimed thousands are infected and that it is underreported, now we have seen cases tenfold since then. There are commenters online claiming that other areas like Jiangxi has seen a noticeable amount if cases.

Whataboutery and denial will not help anything. Saying things like normal flu kills alot too is not a valid argument point. Flu can be identified and vaccines found, thousands may die, millions however will survive. 

With a coronavirus already the death rate is 26 out of 870 or so. Amongst elderly I think SARS killed about half.  And many healthcare workers have now contracted  it due to treating highly infectious pneumonia cases. 

An incubation period of at least a week combined with high density cities and fast transport links especially with the new years travelling and 拜年 could cause this to overrun many health centres.

As it is a newly-discovered virus, there is no vaccine for it yet and the initial spread of it was extremely fast, making it difficult to contain.

As of current, there are suspected cases all around the world, with confirmed cases in countries including South Korea, the U.S, and Vietnam. In China, the spread is getting worse and people are collapsing in the streets and overcrowding hospitals, which in part motivated the Chinese government to lock down the city of Wuhan and quarantine infected individuals (as per regulation when a new disease is spreading)."

Point well taken, according to the article- 

>*Editor's note: This article was updated on Jan. 23 to include discussion of the controversy around the new study.*

>...

>""They have no evidence snakes can be infected by this new coronavirus and serve as a host for it,"" Paulo Eduardo Brandão, a virologist at the University of São Paulo in Brazil, told Nature News. He added that there is no solid evidence that coronaviruses can infect hosts other than mammals and birds. Brandão is currently investigating whether coronaviruses can infect snakes. 



Just to be clear that it was indeed being reported that a recombination between a bat and snake virus had occurred, although that **no longer seems the case** [from EurekAlert](https://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2020-01/w-rtc012220.php):

>By conducting a detailed genetic analysis of the virus and comparing it with available genetic information on different viruses from various geographic locations and host species, the investigators concluded that the 2019-nCoV appears to be a virus that formed from a combination of a coronavirus found in bats and another coronavirus of unknown origin. The resulting virus developed a mix or ""recombination"" of a viral protein that recognizes and binds to receptors on host cells. Such recognition is key to allowing viruses to enter host cells, which can lead to infection and disease.

>bat coronaviruses

SARS was also a bat coronavirus that emerged from a Chinese live market in 2003, long before this BSL4 facility existed.

I mean, you know what else would be a source for bat coronaviruses?  Live bats.  Especially when they're routinely kept in crowded unsanitary conditions conducive to stress and illness.  Invoking the BSL4 facility simply doesn't add any extra explanatory power to the story.  

I'll also note that the ""snake virus"" team was not an international team but was all Chinese researchers, which have a reputation for producing science of widely varying quality.  

I'm just going to copy paste [this newer study](http://virological.org/t/ncovs-relationship-to-bat-coronaviruses-recombination-signals-no-snakes/331), entitled ""**nCoV’s relationship to bat coronaviruses & recombination signals (no snakes)**"".  It shows there's lots of natural bat coronaviruses floating around, for one, and also that there are unknown bat coronavirus lineages probably involved in recombining to create the current one:

>With Xiaowei Jiang at XJTLU we’ve carried out a preliminary evolutionary analysis to characterise the evolutionary origins of the Wuhan virus, nCoV. Focus of our analysis is on the Wuhan-Hu-1 virus (accession no. MN908947, released on GenBank by Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center and School of Public Health, Fudan University, Shanghai, China) as all nCoV cluster together so will share the same evolutionary ancestry. It’s clear from phylogenetic analysis the new human virus is most closely related to bat coronaviruses in the Betacoronaviruses genera. While this is apparent from both the previously reported BLAST and full-genome phylogenetic analysis the closest related bat viruses (CoVZC45 and CoVZXC21) are in fact recombinants with shared breakpoints either side of ORF1b:


>[nCoV-recombination-analysis-v2](http://virological.org/uploads/default/optimized/1X/3121b49b313070ec014a9472ebdd384ed7df2d41_2_1366x1000.png)


>**The phylogenetic clustering of the Wuhan-Hu-1 virus is consistently as a sister group to the SARS-related bat coronaviruses. [Interestingly, a third bat coronavirus (Longquan_140) is a recombinant involving the Wuhan virus lineage in part of ORF1a.](http://virological.org/uploads/default/original/1X/be51925ea16e1879a8acfa4169b08d137e5f843c.png)**

>This analysis has detected three bat coronavirus recombinants (two with shared breakpoints) involving the nCoV lineage indicating greater diversity in the Chinese Sarbecovirus group than previously appreciated. The clustering of the related Sarbecovirus viruses from Kenya and Europe suggest the Wuhan virus is still part of the Sabecovirus sub-genre, and these recombination events probably occurred in bats. Although. given the propensity of coronaviruses to switch hosts, involvement of another species cannot be discounted. There is also a very good chance that a non-bat intermediate species is responsible for the beginning of the current outbreak in Wuhan. Given the tight clustering of the nCoV viruses in phylogenetic trees it seems most likely one event has occurred.

>Several of these bat coronaviruses have been previously detected to be recombinant under-scoring the importance of doing appropriate analysis when analysing these viruses using phylogenetic methods. **Recombination, in this case between divergent coronaviruses circulating in bats, violates our assumption of a single evolutionary tree** and so needs to be considered carefully when inferring coronavirus evolution from complete genome alignments. We’re looking into the patterns of breakpoints to see if there’s any clues to the significance (or not) of these recombination events.

>We’d like to thank the researchers and health professionals for making the nCoV data available.

Question | Answer | Link
---------|----------|----------|
What are they looking for to determine if a patient has Wuhan-itis?|>Wuhan-itis 😂😂  Our airports are screening for fever in all international travelers from countries with active infections. If anyone identifies that they've been in Hubei province or has a fever, they'll be removed from public area submitted to extra evaluation within the airport.  The extra evaluation includes questioning on symptoms and risk factors - running through contact with potential infected people, being in risky areas, lower respiratory symptoms, etc. If anyone exceeds a certain point value, they'll be isolated and taken to any of the 4 facilities nationwide via an ambulance service special response team for evaluation. Conveniently these are all in the major cities with international airports.  Any known PUI (patient under investigation) will be brought directly to the isolation ward skipping the ER, and we'll send off lab work. The lab work isn't very specific for wuhan virus, so they'll use specialist techniques to attempt to identify any viruses present. We'll compare the results to the results of Chinese and American results, and until then that's our only diagnostic mechanism - we're waiting for the American CDC to develop a conclusive specific test.|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/et3mm6/im_on_a_special_response_team_in_the_event_my/ffdycy8/)
What can I do to prevent infection and if I do get infected, what's the worst that could happen and can I be cured?|I'd say practice standard flu season precautions (stay away from people you know are sick, avoid going to china if you can help it, if your in China avoid areas with active infection, eat sanitary food, wash your hands, try to avoid touching your face)  This virus acts a lot like a contagious pneumonia. Pneumonia is not anything uncommon and can be quite dangerous, but most people (especially those with low risk factor) who seek medical attention early come out well. The treatment looks to be mostly supportive at the moment, and similar to typical pneumonia it appears that the deaths are occurring with those high in risk factors to be affected by disease. (The elderly, the sick, etc)|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/et3mm6/im_on_a_special_response_team_in_the_event_my/ffe02nf/)
Country? Age? Gender? What is more dangerous SARS or wuhan coronan virus|I'd prefer not to answer country just for personal reasons - we are quite close to country with active infections if your wondering, but I'm 23 and male.   I'd say they're reletively equal as far as the known information goes. It's just the unknowns that make Wuhan scary at the moment.|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/et3mm6/im_on_a_special_response_team_in_the_event_my/ffe6b1j/)
How fucked are we?|I don't think this will get much worse than the SARS outbreak, which is still scary.|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/et3mm6/im_on_a_special_response_team_in_the_event_my/ffdysn2/)
What are your thoughts on the masks that people have started wearing to try to stop the virus? I'm no science person but isn't it kind of pointless since air gets in from the sides of the masks?|A regular surgical mask isn't a bad precaution against flus, but since it is a respiratory illness it's considered airborne - surgical masks don't protect against airborne viruses.  N95 (or greater) masks should be used if your known to be in contact with a patient having the virus.|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/et3mm6/im_on_a_special_response_team_in_the_event_my/ffe8jsp/)
I know the CDC have upped it to a Stage 3. Is it at the level that if it went worldwide it would become an imminent threat to the human race?|According to the WHO, no.  I personally believe the WHO - but that doesn't mean it's not concerning. I expect it to play out in a similar way to SARS or MERS. Lots of people may get sick, maybe a few hundred deaths, but I don't think it's going to get close to wiping out humanity by any means.|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/et3mm6/im_on_a_special_response_team_in_the_event_my/ffe8ly7/)
What kind of mask do you recommend to protect yourself from the Coronavirus?|Since it's an airborne virus, N95 is recommended - however I like & trust PAPR too much in these scenarios to downgrade to N95.|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/et3mm6/im_on_a_special_response_team_in_the_event_my/ffe95w6/)
Is there a cure? At least at the testing stage?|No, just supportive care|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/et3mm6/im_on_a_special_response_team_in_the_event_my/ffebt7o/)
Is the Wuhan Virus a potential outbreak? I hear about it on the news, but it’s so hard to believe them. Is there a possibility of this having an a big outbreak in places like the US?|I'd say it's far surpassed outbreak criteria, essentially meaning more cases then you'd expect in a community in a season. For Wuhan Virus, that's 0 because it's a brand new virus to humans. That's why it's called a novel (new) viral outbreak  It's possible, I'd call it unlikely though. I'd likely be quickly contained and most of the western countries have very good infrastructure for handling these sorts of scenarios.|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/et3mm6/im_on_a_special_response_team_in_the_event_my/fff1be2/)
Do you have to wear a big hazmat suit? Like the ones they wore to deal with Ebola patients?|We do have those as options on the ward, but that's not mandatory for this. We use a special kind of face mask + goggles, then just disposable clothes + plastic gowns over.|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/et3mm6/im_on_a_special_response_team_in_the_event_my/fff4rg1/)
Do you believe China's figures? 25 dead, 830 infected. I mean, I think it's totally reasonable to be suspicious. To accept these figures we have to trust the Chinese government is telling the truth about something dangerous that puts them in a bad light (not a situation where China is going to be completely forthcoming).|I'd say it's probably not on the dot, but there are international observer organizations involved so it's likely not substantially more.|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/et3mm6/im_on_a_special_response_team_in_the_event_my/fffng3a/)
what kind of casket do you want us to set up a gofundme for|Cremate me|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/et3mm6/im_on_a_special_response_team_in_the_event_my/ffebysr/)
