>China is authoritarian. You cannot trust authoritarians.

>A lesson Americans don’t seem to have ever learned.

Communism hasn't fallen in China, totalitarian authoritarianism is just the governing mechanism.

That being said, communism is nothing more than a 'pie in the sky' lie sold to poor people. It preys on peoples jealousy of others by convincing them that they're oppressed, that anyone who is doing better than them is their oppressor, and that everyone could have more if those at the top weren't so greedy.

In turn they give up their rights to authoritarians who think they know best. Those authoritarians then form a government and strip property from the 'kulaks' (IE: middle class) giving everyone a nice hit of schadenfreude (eat the rich) and a few more dollars in their pockets.

Within a generation all that's left is stifling propaganda, a society of indoctrinated poor people who are afraid of their neighbors because no one wants to lose what little the system is giving them, and a governing elite class at the very top made of 'party' members that's based entirely on nepotism.

**tldr; communism is inherently authoritarian**"

A passenger aboard a cruise ship docked in Sydney Harbour is being tested for possible coronavirus.

The Australian understands that NSW Health are assessing a Singaporean man who fell ill with a respiratory complaint.

The cruise ship arrived in Sydney this morning having believed to be at other Australian ports after travelling from New Zealand.

The Norwegian Jewel arrived in Sydney this morning at 6am and is docked at the international passenger terminal at Circular Quay.

The 294m ship has a guest capacity of 2376 people and 1060 crew.

A source said the man was being tested as a precaution and had not yet been confirmed to have the virus.

He has been taken from the ship. Passengers have now been allowed to leave the ship after earlier being prevented from disembarking.

The precautionary testing is in line with the Victorian government’s approach to a ship where a man had been suspected of having the virus but was later confirmed to have been clear.

Cruise ship Diamond Princess has been quarantined in the Japanese port of Yokohama after 218 coronavirus cases were detected — the largest cluster of infections outside China.

That ship has 3500 passengers and crew aboard.

In Cambodia, another cruise ship, the Westerdam, finally docked after being turned away by several Asian and Pacific governments. No cases of the viral illness have been confirmed aboard, according to the ship’s operator.

2020-02-13,jayo53,Coronavirus,12,https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/f3m5ui/lusting_after_chaos/fhjp42n/,"My favorite scene from a movie I cannot remember is when a woman is sitting on her couch as she looks out of her glass sliding door. There are two men fighting outside her door, but she just sits there watching it. Eventually, the men end up falling through the window and into her house and only then does she realize that this is here, in her house, threatening her. 

It’s a great piece of film because it perfectly portrays modern society. The glass sliding door is our tv, computer, and phones. We consume action and adventure through entertainment every day, and for many of us, watching the Coronavirus grow and spread isn’t much different from watching the latest episode of our TV show. 

Many people will egg it on, and many get a rush when they hear news of it getting worse. We’re all watching the fight outside our glass door, unaware of the reality of the situation until it breaks through. We all lust after chaos, as it’s the internal battle between our human nature and our current organized societies. 

No matter what happens with the virus, people will always lust after chaos. People want to be afraid of the big bad event, because it’s been trained into us from childhood in almost every story we’ve read or watched. People simply expect a climax. 

In truth, there will be a climax, but it will be a different climax for every person here. Assuming the virus is as bad as we fear, my climax could be vastly different from yours. The virus will spread slowly, and climax at different times for every person. Unfortunately we’d never know until it breaks through the glass.

Bloomberg News
7-9 minutes

For one coronavirus patient at ground zero of the outbreak, the journey from infection to recovery was a nightmare scenario that entailed multiple hospital visits, symptoms so severe he thought he would die and quarantine under police watch.

Tiger Ye -- not his real name -- is a 21-year-old student in Wuhan, the central Chinese city where the new, still little understood virus first emerged. Ye, who doesn’t want to be identified for fear of being ostracized, first suspected he’d caught the illness that’s spread around the world on Jan. 21, when he felt too weak to finish dinner. He checked his temperature, and it was up.

At the time, little was known about the virus now known as 2019-nCov, but paranoia was rapidly building after authorities confirmed the highly contagious pathogen was spreading between humans in the city of 11 million. It was midnight when Ye arrived at Wuhan’s top-tier Tongji Hospital to see a waiting room filled with people like him. Feverish, he knew he would have to wait hours to be tested.

“I was scared,” he said. “Countless cases were piling up on the desks, and every single doctor was wearing protective clothes, something I’d never seen before.”

What followed was more than two weeks of anxiety and desperation as Ye tried to confirm if he had the pneumonia-causing virus and get treatment for his increasingly severe symptoms. He was one of the lucky ones, beating the sickness in part because his father -- a health care worker -- was aware of the risks earlier than most of Wuhan’s population.
Under Siege

More than 1,000 people have died from the new coronavirus in Hubei, the Chinese province that Wuhan is the capital of, as a severe shortage of hospital beds, testing kits and other basic medical equipment mean many have to stand in line for hours to get diagnosed, and some die before even seeing a doctor. China has quarantined vast swathes of Hubei, and the outbreak has caused parts of the world’s second-biggest economy to shut down as scientists across the world race to find a cure.

Read about how China has sacrificed Hubei to try and stem the virus spread

The night Ye first sought treatment, he was able to procure medicine from a smaller hospital nearby after abandoning the wait at Tongji. Because his symptoms weren’t classed as very severe, doctors told him to just go home and quarantine himself.

The first four days of the illness were brutal.

“I suffered from a high fever and pains that tortured every part of my body,” said Ye, who’s a big fan of Japanese culture and has ambitions of becoming a voice actor. He spent the days watching Japanese cartoons to distract from the discomfort.
‘Coughing Like I Was Going to Die’

By the time his follow-up appointment at the hospital arrived four days later, the Wuhan government had locked down the city, barring anyone from leaving to stop the virus’ spread. Everything changed in an instant: roads were empty, prices for fresh fruit and vegetables surged, and residents were unsure if they were even allowed to leave their apartments.

Ye’s condition had also deteriorated. “I was coughing like I was going to die,” he said.

At the hospital, multiple CT scans showed it was highly likely Ye had contracted the novel coronavirus and that it had spread to his lungs. Doctors deliberated if he qualified for a nucleic acid test, which would use the virus’ genetic sequence to confirm if he had been infected, but it was decided his case wasn’t severe enough, and the precious supply of test kits had to be reserved for more critical patients.
‘Hell’s Door’

Diagnosis has emerged as one of the major stumbling blocks in getting the virus under control in Hubei, where the number of those who fear they are infected far outweighs the capacity of hospitals to confirm if they are. On Thursday, Hubei began counting patients who were diagnosed via CT imaging alongside those who tested positive with the nucleic acid kits, resulting in a more than 45% surge in the number of confirmed cases, to nearly 50,000 people.

As Ye convalesced at home after his second hospital visit -- not knowing if he had the virus or not -- his brother and grandmother also began to show symptoms of infection. Overnight, Ye’s condition worsened to the point he thought he might die.

“I thought I was knocking on hell’s door,” he said.

Ye went back to the hospital after his temperature soared to 39 degrees Celsius (about 102 degrees Fahrenheit). Doctors put him on an iv and administered Kaletra, a combination drug used to treat HIV that has shown some success in combating the virus, bringing his temperature down to 37 degrees by the end of the day.

China Stages Clinical Trial Blitz in Search of Coronavirus Cure

A week after the symptoms first began, Ye appeared to be reaching a turning point.
Virus Confirmed

The young student’s condition was steadily improving when he finally secured one of the coveted test kits on Jan. 29. It confirmed he had the virus that’s triggered travel bans around the world. His doctor gave him a five-day course of the antiviral drug Aluvia and sent him back to his three-bedroom apartment for quarantine, in part because the hospital didn’t have enough beds to accommodate him.

Nine days later on Feb. 7, another set of nucleic acid tests came back negative for the virus, but Ye wasn’t out of the woods. After reports that even patients who tested negative could slip into critical distress, the local government quarantined him in a hotel that had been turned into a makeshift hospital. Police stood guard outside to prevent anyone from leaving or entering.

Ye was allowed to go home five days later, ending a saga that began more than three weeks ago. He‘s thankful he survived, and salutes the doctors and nurses who put their own lives at risk to help him. Some doctors told him they suspected they had the virus, but continued to treat patients.

China’s Sick Doctors Show How Infection Breaches Fan Coronavirus

Like many Chinese, Ye is critical of the government’s response to the outbreak, especially the slow initial response from local officials that meant a precious opportunity to contain the virus early on was missed. The two most senior Communist Party cadres in Hubei were replaced Thursday, as Beijing tries to gain control of the spiraling crisis.

“Hubei has missed one opportunity after another while they were trying to keep things under wraps,” Ye said. “Things wouldn’t have come to this point if the government hadn’t hidden information a month ago.”

Viruses are very complex to say the least. There aren’t really any treatments for viruses except supportive care. They pretty much have 3 options: they die on their own, they kill you, or they stay dormant in your body. 

Even when you catch various viruses, they may have lasting effects on your overall health. Chicken pox for example may develop into shingles. HIV may develop into AIDS. There is never a cure. It’s ONLY supportive care. Even a regular flu can cause minor heart damage. 

This is why it’s so important to get a vaccine for common virus such as the flu. The problem with the coronavirus is that we don’t know what they lasting effects may be.

There are other countries that had more people from Wuhan go there, so it doesn't make sense that Singapore would actually have more cases than some other countries like Thailand and Indonesia.

Contingency is for 1% death rate, 3% hospitalization from an infection pool of 20-35% of US population. Which is in the ballpark for this crisis, potentially.

Plan acknowledges that 'involuntary quarantine' would not work and would just lead to further spreading the virus.

Entire military would be called up to provide security, communications, essential services and possible manning of logistics networks for said essential services. This would include liaisoning with private entities as well.

They expect successive waves of infection and 6-9 month latency on vaccine production.

Force protection will be a priority (put your mask on first idea) and they expect something like 40% absenteeism rate.

Civilian air transport systems will not be relied upon.

Logistics will prioritize vaccine and anti-viral delivery, Tamiflu is mentioned specifically. Ventilators are another key item for stockpiling and delivery.

The importance of databases and tracking the pandemic is emphasized.

>Overnight 14’840 cases, including 13’332 clinically diagnosed cases were reported from Hubei. This is the first time China has reported clinically diagnosed cases in addition to laboratory-confirmed cases. For consistency, we report here only the number of laboratory-confirmed cases. WHO has formally requested additional information on the clinically diagnosed cases, in particular when these have occurred in the course of the outbreak and whether suspect cases were reclassified as clinically diagnosed cases.

So it looks like the WHO excluded the clinically diagnosed cases for consistency, for now, but may start to include clinically diagnosed cases in the future once it clarifies reporting. Overall I'm kind of irritated that they didn't just go ahead and make the distinction in this report -- the numbers should reflect the reality of the pandemic instead of quibbling over how the numbers were sourced, in my opinion."

Because it can spread so quickly and has a high rate of infection in close quarters.

100-500:  Stop air travel and venues with large crowds.

500-2000: Limit travel to work and store. Others who don't need to work/school stay home

2000+ Work from home, dont leave except for emergencies and always wearing mask, googles,  gloves.

This changes based on the location of the community spread."

What we do have is a hot mess in Wuhan - and some real signals that this illness has the potential to be very different that seasonal flu and more like pandemic flu. We have a government in China that has been less than transparent about reporting facts on the ground. These factors add to uncertainty and alarm.

The other thing the article left out is the cost if we under-value risk at the beginning of a potential pandemic - the cost can be quite high. The benefit of being overly cautious at this point in time is low compared to the future cost of not exercising an abundance of caution. You only need to wrong once and send one Super Spreader Steve into the population to seed widespread community-based transmission.

A recovery story of a 21-year-old student

Ye, who doesn’t want to be identified for fear of being ostracized, first suspected he’d caught the illness that’s spread around the world on Jan. 21, when he felt too weak to finish dinner. He checked his temperature, and it was up.

It was midnight when Ye arrived at Wuhan’s top-tier Tongji Hospital to see a waiting room filled with people like him. Feverish, he knew he would have to wait hours to be tested.

The night Ye first sought treatment, he was able to procure medicine from a smaller hospital nearby after abandoning the wait at Tongji. Because his symptoms weren’t classed as very severe, doctors told him to just go home and quarantine himself.

The first four days of the illness were brutal.
“I suffered from a high fever and pains that tortured every part of my body,"" said Ye, who’s a big fan of Japanese culture and has ambitions of becoming a voice actor. He spent the days watching Japanese cartoons to distract from the discomfort.

By the time his follow-up appointment at the hospital arrived four days later, the Wuhan government had locked down the city, barring anyone from leaving to stop the virus’ spread. Everything changed in an instant: roads were empty, prices for fresh fruit and vegetables surged, and residents were unsure if they were even allowed to leave their apartments.

Ye’s condition had also deteriorated. “I was coughing like I was going to die,"" he said.

At the hospital, multiple CT scans showed it was highly likely Ye had contracted the novel coronavirus and that it had spread to his lungs. Doctors deliberated if he qualified for a nucleic acid test, which would use the virus’ genetic sequence to confirm if he had been infected, but it was decided his case wasn’t severe enough, and the precious supply of test kits had to be reserved for more critical patients.

As Ye convalesced at home after his second hospital visit -- not knowing if he had the virus or not -- his brother and grandmother also began to show symptoms of infection. Overnight, Ye’s condition worsened to the point he thought he might die.

“I thought I was knocking on hell’s door,"" he said.

Ye went back to the hospital after his temperature soared to 39 degrees Celsius (about 102 degrees Fahrenheit). Doctors put him on an iv and administered Kaletra, a combination drug used to treat HIV that has shown some success in combating the virus, bringing his temperature down to 37 degrees by the end of the day.

A week after the symptoms first began, Ye appeared to be reaching a turning point.

The young student’s condition was steadily improving when he finally secured one of the coveted test kits on Jan. 29. It confirmed he had the virus that’s triggered travel bans around the world. His doctor gave him a five-day course of the antiviral drug Aluvia and sent him back to his three-bedroom apartment for quarantine, in part because the hospital didn’t have enough beds to accommodate him.

Nine days later on Feb. 7, another set of nucleic acid tests came back negative for the virus, but Ye wasn’t out of the woods. After reports that even patients who tested negative could slip into critical distress, the local government quarantined him in a hotel that had been turned into a makeshift hospital. Police stood guard outside to prevent anyone from leaving or entering.

Ye was allowed to go home five days later, ending a saga that began more than three weeks ago. He‘s thankful he survived, and salutes the doctors and nurses who put their own lives at risk to help him. Some doctors told him they suspected they had the virus, but continued to treat patients."

If you do any sort of data studies like I have for the last 19 years, then you would understand that stating the current rate of 2% is the same as saying the sun and stars revolve around earth. We don’t have nearly enough data yet to make any sort of accurate prediction on this. When SARS and MERS were only 20-25 days into their outbreaks, they too were at 2%. Then the final closest approximations turned out to be 10 and 17% respectively. Another piece to all of this right now is that too many people are stuck in what is called Normality Bias - “is a tendency for people to believe that things will always function the way they have normally have functioned and therefore underestimate both the likelihood of a disaster and its possible effects.” That can create dangerous times whereas people are not as careful or vigilant as they should be because they think nothing will go wrong. It is my opinion that as a species, we should be more on the Realist side than be on the Ignorant or Carefree side. Cheers to all.

Since it is weird that a tiny mammal could carry so many horrific diseases and not be effected by them (Ebola, SARS, etc)

It seems to come down to the fact that they can fly which as we know is extremely rare for mammals. The reason why is due to the fact that the incredible energy levels needed to generate flight requires extreme levels of internal heat, which put significant stress on the mammalian genetic code. Bats in turn evolved to withstand this without damaging themselves but it also meant the viruses that it carried also evolved to survive such strenuous conditions. So...

When virus jump from Bats, our petty immune responses cant hope to beat such strong pathogens"

When this hits, there is going to be a lot of panic buying. People will be hitting pharmacies and stores to desperately get supplies, just like people stock up on toilet paper and milk before a big storm. When the virus makes it to your area, your ability to go out and about may not be the thing that is compromised.

The real danger that this is presenting is not the illness itself. With a 2-3% CFR, it's not exactly going to bring about Armageddon. What it will do is break the back of the transportation industry, as ports close, airways are restricted, and mail delivery is delayed. Every mode of transportation that is not electronic will shut down. That means that goods will not be refreshed in stores or pharmacies, leading to a shortage of everything from vegetables, to fruits, to rice, to ampicillin in the pharmacy isle. This is why during hurricane season, lumber yards stock up on plyboard. This is also why there are always people late on prep and that have to resort to nailing random boards to windows in an attempt to protect themselves when it's too late. After all, what logistics company would drive toward the eye of a hurricane before it makes landfall?

You'll know who didn't prepare in time because they'll be living off of Hostess snack cakes and taro root because that's all that was left in their local store before it closed.

You're also preparing for the recovery period afterward, where those transport networks are rebooted and the massive backlog of packages and goods comes flooding back into the area. It could take a bit after things settle for the just-in-time delivery to be restored. Stores and pharmacies will be absolutely crushed by the flood of consumers coming in to stock up their shelves after they've held their consumerist breath for the month. Checkout lines will be 10 deep with people replenishing what they ate with normal amounts of food. You won't want to wade through that.

Roadways will be clogged into major cities by large amounts of 18 wheelers trying to deliver. UPS will be working overtime to deliver packages because their ability to fly cargo was affected. Intermodal rail will be backed up in train yards for miles as cargo is transferred from rail to road. Transit will be strained.

You might also be preparing for peak energy usage. With more people indoors, more heaters will run, more hot water will be used, and peak usage times for local power plants might be extended. We may see more energy usage than normal, which could lead to even more trucks out there, trying to deliver coal and natural gas to distribution centers. People with propane heat, oil heat, coal heat, will have issues scheduling deliveries to their homes.

By stocking up on food and water, you're not preparing to avoid the illness...you're preparing for the chaos that will ensue during and after."

The population density in Chinatown is crazy and hygiene is lacking (coming from somebody who loves to walk through Chinatown). I feel that local health/government officials would keep it under wraps because mass panic in the city would be devestating. NYC has surprisingly delicate infrastructure and is considered one of the biggest travel destinations in the world. Not to mention possibly the biggest business capital of the United States, if not world. A mass quarantine in NYC would absolutely decimate the economy beyond comprehension. It's in the city's best interest to keep any cases under wrap and hope that the warmer months will aid in stopping the spread.

Also you have to factor in that many people don't have Healthcare and people who do usually have ridiculous deductibles. The new year means that deductibles have reset, which makes people wary of getting medical attention if the aren't dying.

But it's impossible to know when a panic will set in. At any point over the next couple weeks a headline could pop up on the nightly news that says ""100 new cases confirmed stemming from international airport X"" - (ATL-LAX-ORD). Depending on the general emotional state of the nation at the point, it could lead to a run on grocery stores. And that could mean if you wait till it happens, you may end up wanting.  
  
Take Hurricanes for example. If you wait until the forecast confirms the path towards your home, you might end up looking at empty isles when you go to the store. It's the people who saw that storm a couple days earlier, got a sketchy feeling about it and stocked up who are ready while the naysayers end up without shutters to cover their homes or gasoline for their generators.  I've spent enough time on the east coast to see this play out in person. 
  
As a general rule, I think EVERYBODY should have at least a month of food stored that you can very easily rotate over the course of a year without being ""irresponsible"". At any point something could happen. A solar flare could knock out the grid for a month in a flash and it'll be the people who just did the bare minimum of prepping who fare way better than those who pretend like everything will be fine all the time forever.  
  
I can't imagine how foolish I would feel the morning after a panic sets in and my cupboards only have a couple cans of chunky soup when I could have dropped $50-100 a couple days earlier for insurance and at least been in a position to wait out the first couple weeks."

SARS     9.6%  
MERS     32.6% but he said it wasn’t easy to get  
Ebola     65.7% (DAMN!)  
Spanish flu     2.5%  (so...close to this, which was considered devastating)  
seasonal influenza     0.02%  

A flat 2% means that if 100 get COVID, 2 will die out of the 15 that got it severely.  That’s close to what Spanish flu did.  That’s what this is doing.  We/they think.  

So when people compare COVID to “the flu,” the flu was only 0.02%--that’s not 2 of 100, that 2 of 10,000!  Where the flu kills 2 out of 10,000, COVID is looking like 200 out of 10,000.  How many in your city?  If a very small town of 5,000 *could* lose 100 people.  A city of 1,000,000 could lose 20,000.  That’s a lot of dead.  

And that’s not counting the severely ill, which is looking like 15%.  Small town of 5,000?  That’s 750 people needing medical help, oxygen, monitoring--for up to 2 weeks!  City of 1M?  That’s 150,000 people needing this.  I don’t know a city that has that many hospital bed, supplies, or personnel to care for that many patients."
