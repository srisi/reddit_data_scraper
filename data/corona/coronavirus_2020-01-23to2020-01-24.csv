Comparing numbers of deaths directly makes NO sense, considering the number of cases are VASTLY different. Again, flu is endemic everywhere. This coronavirus strain just came into existence. The 2019-nCoV is an **emerging** disease, most flu strains are well established.

To determine how much of a threat a new virus is, two parameters matter most: 

\-Lethality. Not known yet for the 2019-nCoV, as most infection cases are still very recent. (i.e. a large portion of the infected haven't had the time to die or recover from it). Simply dividing the number of deaths (18) by the number of currently known cases (654) gives you a 2.7% death rate, which is a ***lower bound***, and already superior to most influenza strains. High fatality rates are not uncommon to coronaviruses. The MERS-CoV had a fatality rate of 38%.

\-Contagiousness. Again, not fully known or understood for this new strain. Potentially quite high, as the high number of cases appearing in such a short timespan since its emergence would suggest."

Here, we see the personification of the Wuhan Coronavirus, AKA Corona-Chan. She is serving soup to the animated character Winnie the Pooh. Now, this meme isn't that hard to explain if you have been watching the news. A coronavirus infection started in a city called Wuhan in China, and it's been infecting a lot of people! It's been spreading to multiple countries such as Thailand, Vietnam, Korea, Japan, and even the United States! Scary! The bat soup basically means that bats may have been a possible cause in this outbreak, from the bat consumption that sometimes goes on in China. Winnie the Pooh here represents the Chinese leader Xi JinPing, who resembles Pooh a lot.

It's a brand new, highly contagious and deadly virus. It has been in existence for less than a month, yet already infected >600 people. A number that will grow exponentially as it is transported to more and more areas of the globe.

The flu kills more, because it has been around longer, and therefore currently more common, endemic to all regions of the globe. But the spread of this coronavirus has just begun, and seems to be going very rapidly. 

If it is not stopped, it is possible it would cause just as many (or even more) deaths as the flu. Especially since unlike with flu strains, we have no vaccine against coronaviruses, or means to rapidly develop one.

Maybe in the end, it will turn out perfectly fine. Maybe it will only have been a seasonal thing, that gets wiped out as soon as the weather conditions are less favourable to its transmission. But maybe not, and we simply can't take the risk."

It's worth noting that around 92% of Influenza deaths are people over the age of 50, the vast majority of the time it contributes to a death and isn't often the sole cause of one. If your immune system is strong, you are almost certain to fight it off. If your immune system is weak due to other factors, then it can easily be fatal.

This is definitely inaccurate. From the official WHO briefing earlier today:

>The initial source of 2019-nCoV still remains unknown. However, it is clear the growing outbreak is no longer due to ongoing exposures at the Huanan seafood market in Wuhan; as in the last one week, less than 15% of new cases reported having visited Huanan market. There is now more evidence that 2019-nCoV spreads from human- to- human and also across generations of cases. Moreover, family clusters involving persons with no reported travel to Wuhan have been  reported from Guangdong Province. There have been very few reports of hospital outbreaks or infections of health care workers, which is a prominent feature of MERS and SARS. WHO assesses the risk of this event to be very high in China, high at the regional level and moderate at the global level.

Additionally, the Chinese government has reported 4th-generation cases in Wuhan. This means that someone originally infected in the market spread the virus to someone else, who spread it to someone else, who spread it to a final person.

2020-01-23,Craig_VG,neoliberal,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/neoliberal/comments/espiul/discussion_thread/ffd18jj/,"**Some interesting facts about this coronavirus:**

1) It’s new! That’s why they’re calling it coronavirus, it’s one of many but we don’t have an official name for it yet. We also don’t know which animal it came from for sure yet. The current working name is 2019-nCoV but it'll gain an official name later that we'll start seeing in the press.

2) The World Health Organization hasn’t yet declared this a PHEIC (public health emergency of international concern). But it probably will soon. That is the highest level of health emergency possible, and the distinction was created after the SARS outbreak in the early 2000s of a different coronavirus. SARS ended up infecting 8098 people and killing 774

3) Today’s coronavirus seems to be less lethal than SARS (~10% lethality) but far more lethal than 2009’s H1N1 (which infected over a billion people, but only caused hundred’s of thousands of deaths). 2009 H1N1 was the first PHEIC. This Coronavirus looks to be about a 1% fatality rate. 

4) China is reacting to this coronavirus much like the SARS outbreak and is calling in contractors to build quarantine facilities “at the fastest speed possible” as they expect this outbreak to be 10x worse than SARS

5) It has medically confirmed to have spread to 10 countries, while suspected to have spread to about 20. Currently there are 654 confirmed cases, and 18 fatalities. These are only medically confirmed cases and there are probably more than this, just testing hasn’t caught up yet. 

6) The first case is rumored to have been found on 8 December, but officially open 31st December. They confirmed it as a new disease on 9 January, and we’ve really seen the number of cases balloon over the current week.

Researching and writing this all out helped me understand the context of this outbreak, and I hope it helps anyone curious as well. I'm no expert, just researched what I could online and listened to WHO press conferences."

Seeing how Ma's government went under that, and Tsai said no, I imagine it's rather obvious yes?

The environment crisis in Australia, yes, that's awful, but it will probably become the new norm in the coming years. Prepare your butts.

But to call the coronavirus a ""pandemic"" is a gross misunderstanding of the situation. The reason why we know so much and we are paying so close attention is because China actively suppressed information about SARS. But that turned out to be a bad idea because it affected way more people than it should have. China learned their lesson and they are treating this seriously.

YES - without question, the CCP is censoring both news and also the flow of information. The CCP both does this directly (internet police deleting or blocking websites) and also by structuring government and society to scare people into not sharing information.  


The second part - the structuring of society and government to incentivize people (especially leaders, like hospital administrators, mayors, and ministry of health officials) not to share \*negative\* news is the big one here. It means that even if Xi Jinping himself says ""please please for the sake of our country and our children, share honest numbers about those sick and dead"", mayors and hospital administrators and healthy ministry officials STILL will not share honest numbers - because that means admitting they lied about the numbers earlier, and they'll be punished after the epidemic is over.

Personal note: I am from Dallas, not there currently, and used to work at UT Southwestern. Dallas is extremely diligent about these screenings since the Ebola case at Texas Health Presbyterian. 

https://www.dallasnews.com/news/public-health/2020/01/23/dallas-hospitals-begin-screening-patients-for-recent-travel-to-china-after-virus-outbreak/

Many Dallas hospitals have started screening patients for recent travel to China at the recommendation of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention since a new pneumonia-like virus originating from the country has infected hundreds of people and left several dead.

The outbreak of a new strain of coronavirus was first detected in Wuhan, China, on Jan. 7, the World Health Organization said. Cases of the virus have been confirmed in four other countries, and the CDC confirmed the first U.S. case on Tuesday in Washington.

Dr. Philip Huang, director of Dallas County Health and Human Services, said his department has been in ongoing discussions with local hospitals about how to prepare and screen for the virus.

“The situation is evolving, and we continue to try and prepare in the appropriate ways,” Huang said.

Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses that can cause a range of respiratory illnesses, according to the CDC. Known strains include Middle East respiratory syndrome, or MERS, and severe acute respiratory syndrome, or SARS. Symptoms can include fever, coughing and breathing difficulties, while serious cases can cause pneumonia, severe acute respiratory syndrome, kidney failure and death, according to WHO.

Dr. Wendy Chung, chief epidemiologist at Dallas County Health and Human Services, said the department is in regular contact with local hospitals and health care providers. Since the outbreak of the new coronavirus, the department has had regular discussions with local hospitals about CDC recommendations for health care providers.

Last Friday, the CDC published guidelines for how providers should evaluate, test and report patients showing symptoms. The agency recommended providers get a detailed travel history of patients, specifically a history of travel from Wuhan, China, and report possible cases to their state’s health department.

Chung said most hospital systems in Dallas have implemented or are working to implement the guidelines.

“Everyone is taking this very seriously,” Chung said. “All of the administrators understand this is a high priority and this should be on everybody’s radar. Everybody’s working on it in some form or fashion.”

Methodist Dallas Medical Center, UT Southwestern Medical Center, Parkland Memorial Hospital and Children's Medical Center Dallas are among Dallas hospitals that have implemented updated screening questionnaires.

Some hospitals, like Methodist and Children’s, always ask patients about recent travel. Children’s also asks the question of visitors to the hospital.

Children’s began asking specifically about recent travel to China on Jan. 10, just days after the new strain of the virus was detected, a Children’s Health spokesperson said.

At Parkland and UT Southwestern, every patient is first being asked if they have traveled recently, and then if they have any respiratory symptoms.

“Right now, everyone has respiratory symptoms,” said Dr. Trish Perl, chief of the division of infectious diseases at UT Southwestern and an epidemiologist at Parkland. “If you haven’t traveled and you have respiratory symptoms, you probably have the flu. … If you have traveled and have symptoms, we can do a deeper dive and ask questions [like], ‘Have you been to Wuhan, [or] have you been in contact with anyone who has?’”

Baylor Scott & White Health said in a prepared statement that the Baylor University Medical Center at Dallas is following CDC guidelines for the new coronavirus.

“As part of our normal patient evaluation process, we conduct screens for infectious diseases symptoms and travel history outside of the United States,"" the hospital said. “If a patient has traveled outside of the US, we review the CDC’s travelers’ health website for global outbreaks. Real-time information is posted from around the world, allowing for providers to receive up-to-date alerts as well as recommendations from the CDC.”

No cases of the new coronavirus have been reported in Dallas County. The CDC said while it is still researching how easily the virus spreads, the immediate health risk for people in the U.S. is currently low.

In addition to China, cases of the new virus have also been confirmed in Japan, South Korea, Taiwan and Thailand, according to the CDC. Chinese officials announced a nationwide quarantine Wednesday, and health experts in a WHO Emergency Committee are in the process this week of deciding whether the coronavirus outbreak is a public health emergency.

To prevent contracting the virus, WHO and CDC recommend frequently washing your hands, regularly cleaning and disinfecting surfaces, avoiding close contact with people who are sick, and maintaining safe food practices."

***The types of Virus from the US CDC***:

Coronaviruses are named for the crown-like spikes on their surface. There are four main sub-groupings of coronaviruses, known as alpha, beta, gamma, and delta.

Human coronaviruses were first identified in the mid-1960s. The seven coronaviruses that can infect people are:

#Common human coronaviruses

1. 229E (alpha coronavirus)
1. NL63 (alpha coronavirus)
1. OC43 (beta coronavirus)
1. HKU1 (beta coronavirus)

#Other human coronaviruses

1. MERS-CoV (the beta coronavirus that causes Middle East Respiratory Syndrome, or MERS)
1. SARS-CoV (the beta coronavirus that causes severe acute respiratory syndrome, or SARS)
1. 2019 Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV)

People around the world commonly get infected with human coronaviruses 229E, NL63, OC43, and HKU1.

Sometimes coronaviruses that infect animals can evolve and make people sick and become a new human coronavirus. Three recent examples of this are 2019-nCoV, SARS-CoV, and MERS-CoV.

That virulent strain of flu is still out there, and no quarantines are in place to control it. I am not suggesting that we should insight mass hysteria over the flu, but rather that the spectacle of the new coronavirus could twist one's perspective so that they overlook or underestimate a well-known and widespread risk because they are focused on a more eye-catching one.

The author of that piece is not only opposed to quarantines, but also seems opposed to airport screenings. She seems to be under the impression that urging the public to self-report symptoms is the best way to control epidemics:

> An informed, alert public may to do more to control the spread of the Wuhan coronavirus than airport screening. 1st US patient turned himself in when he noted symptoms and said he's been in Wuhan. #WuhanSARS #wuhanvirus

I personally would not trust the public to self-report symptoms after travelling, especially for a disease which shares symptoms with the flu: this is a prisoner's dilemma where symptomatic individuals likely see many small personal benefits to denying their symptoms and hiding their illness as long as possible, such as not having to deal with the US healthcare system while on vacation, or being able to tour for one more day. However, the cost to the public is potentially large. I hardly trust Americans to make an informed decision to self-report symptoms, and I have met Chinese people who are well below the US median in their ability to competently make health care decisions. (I have seen Chinese people who go to a Chinese traditional medicine clinic for flu-like symptoms and who refuse a tetanus vaccination because ""I'm strong."")

Furthermore, on the basis of these experiences, I would not trust a journalist who makes anti-screening arguments to have the capacity to objectively consider quarantines.

But that is in a sense *ad hominem*. To get more substantive, it seems the main concerns of the article were (1) that quarantines are unconstitutional, and (2) that health care professionals with (Ebola) experience were being stuck in long state quarantines, when their experience would be better spent helping patients.

I'm not going to consider the minority issue, because the ethical concerns surrounding quarantine seem to be easily offset by providing sufficient monetary offsets for the quarantined. The fact that screening / quarantining for disease disproportionately effects minority populations is furthermore not a result of prejudice, but an inevitability, given that most new transmissible diseases arise as a result of human-animal interactions, and most human-animal interactions occur outside of the West. 

To consider the article's arguments, I think each argument falls flat in two significant ways: (1a) At the federal level, quarantine constitutes ""regulation of interstate commerce"". This rationale justifies other federal regulations that have long since been accepted: the Clean Water Act, for example, applies to navigable waterways, on the questionable rationale that waterways may be used for commerce. The CDC is justified in a similar manner, and the same reasoning that makes the CDC an instrument of interstate commerce also justifies airport travel screening by federal officials and quarantines. (1b) The article notes that quarantines are being imposed by state executive orders, and state officials are overstepping state constitutions. Disease control is among the powers delegated to the states.

(2a) Health care workers are held to a higher standard of health than the public, because they interact with vulnerable populations. At my workplace, a TB diagnosis during annual screening will result in a health care worker losing their job, albeit with severance. (2b) The amount of care a health care worker can provide is roughly proportional to the number of patients they see per day, which also determines the size of the network that would need follow-up, should they be infected. In short, at given risk of infection, increased expected contributions from working are exactly offset by higher risk to society."

So far, only the elderly and those with compromised immune systems have been killed. 

A lot of people who have contracted it are reporting severe cold-like symptoms. Basically the flu (which is obviously caused by a different virus).

Most experts I've seen talking about it believe it won't have as high of a mortality rate as SARs but again it's early, things can change.

Every time it changes host, it replicates, in order to spread itself in the surroundings. This replication is prone to introduce changes in a small portion of the new viruses.

If these changes are on the surface of the virus, this is an advantage. Let me explain why. 

The immune system recognizes known viruses by matching their ""looks"" (what molecules they have on the surface) to a library of previously encountered viruses. This library usually does not recognize every molecule of the virus, but only a small, representative portion: it's faster and uses less resources.

So, if the virus replicates and some new copies have  differences in a few proteins on the surface, some people won't be able to correctly recognize the virus when it comes back from spreading around the world.

You can expect changes to happen, if you think the flu spreads through millions of people, each one producing a boaoad of new viruses.

Some strains are worse than others. You sometimes see concern for bird or swine flu. Why? Mostly because it has pandemic potential, meaning that it can, in theory, spread through most of the human population. Here is why:

Changing species is not easy and requires a lot of changes and adaptations. The problem is that weare dependent on animals and we live with them, so there's always a chance that a change allows ghe virus to spread exactly in a nearby cattle. When this happens, it means the virus changed a lot and the library of previous flu strains is rendered almost useless. Most of the population can be affected and so health organizations raise concerns over a pandemic potential.

Despite my lenghty explanation and my background, I lack the necessary information and knowledge to give you insights about the coronavirus outbreak."

The coronavirus, like SARS in 2003, targets the lungs and essentially turns them into super tight, highly inflamed organs.  You can't expand your lungs for them to do their job.  The problem here is that ""life support"" machines only do the breathing for you, and if your lungs can't expand, they can literally be ripped to shreds trying to do so.

Unlike the bones, brain, kidneys and heart that when damaged, they can be rested while the healing process occurs.  The more damaged the lungs are, the harder they have to work to keep the body alive.

There are about 1000 people known to have it. Let's say it means ten times that actually have it, most of them not knowing. That's 10 000 persons.

Now how many people have ""a sore throat and severe coughing"" ? That's hard to estimate. For reference, Google tells me the flue is responsible for about 49 millions illness since 2010. Based on that, I'd assume that the number of people having a cold right now is probably at least 5 millions, right ? I think I'm being very conservative with this estimate.

Based on that, your chance of having the Coronavirus would about 10 000/5 millions = 0.002

And keep in mind we've been very conservative at every step of the evaluation, so the actual chances are much lower than that."

Here we go again.

A mysterious outbreak sickens people in China, causing panic in Hong Kong, Singapore, and Taiwan as the world awaits real information from Beijing. We have been here many times before, from deadly influenza epidemics in the 1990s to SARS in 2003, with more flus since and recently even a cluster of pneumonic plague cases.

This time around, the story begins with a mysterious respiratory outbreak on Dec. 12 in the central Chinese city of Wuhan. It sent at least 59 people to isolation wards in infectious diseases hospitals, where seven are now said to be in critical condition. As is typical, Beijing has kept mum about the outbreak, aside from insisting that the scientists—including non-Chinese—toiling to identify the culprit microorganism need to maintain secrecy and that there is no evidence that it can be spread from person to person. In fact, the government delayed notifying anybody about the pneumonia outbreak until Wuhan city officials acknowledged it two weeks after its apparent onset. In part because of the delay, the disease spread—according to some sources, there have been at least 16 suspected cases so far in restive Hong Kong and one putative case in Singapore—and Beijing has threatened to jail individuals who convey further information about the disease on social media.

The government of Chinese President Xi Jinping is doing itself no favors by handling outbreaks in such a brutal and secretive fashion. Regardless of whatever legitimate scientific inquiry may now be underway, the lack of transparency and domestic repression of so-called rumormongers simply fuel international suspicions of a cover-up, perhaps of a larger-than-admitted epidemic. Most of the news media worldwide has compared the Wuhan outbreak to the 2003 SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome) epidemic, which spread from mainland China to nearly 30 nations, sickening upwards of 8,000 people, killing 774, and sowing panic around the world.
China would do well to remember the lessons of that outbreak—particularly the humiliation its leaders suffered from anger across Asia—and open the lid on daily information on the Wuhan pneumonia investigation. And it had better do so before Jan. 25, the Lunar New Year, when millions of Chinese pass through the nation’s high-speed train hub of Wuhan on their way to celebrate the holiday with relatives.

**------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------**

As of this writing, it seems that the new outbreak started in, or around, a very large indoor fish market in the city of Wuhan, which has a population of more than 11 million and is located south of Beijing in Hubei province. Whatever the precise origin, most of the subsequent infections have been in Wuhan. Two of China’s major rivers—the Yangtze and Han—flow through the city, making it one of China’s oldest and most important centers of commerce. It is also a hub in China’s vast high-speed railway system, which carries millions of passengers daily. In other words, the latest outbreak has not struck some remote outpost, as has been the case with other epidemics, including Ebola in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, but has arisen in a central hub in a country that is, itself, at the center of international trade and travel.

The Medical Administration of Wuhan Municipal Health Committee first raised the alarm on Dec. 30, when it posted a red alert on its website, declaring an “urgent notice on the treatment of pneumonia of unknown cause.” Local reporters who called the Health Committee hotline were merely told that there was a pneumonia outbreak of unknown cause involving 27 patients, most of whom were connected in some way to the South China Seafood Market. The patients exhibited respiratory distress, reduced white blood cell counts, and high fevers, and they failed to improve with antibiotic treatment. A viral cause was suspected.

On New Year’s Eve, Hubei provincial authorities put out a report announcing that an official inquiry concurred that “27 cases of viral pneumonia have been found, all of which were diagnosed with viral pneumonia/pulmonary infection. Of the 27 cases, seven were critically ill, and the remaining cases were controllable. Two of them improved and were expected to be discharged soon.”

That night, Hong Kong authorities began tightening security, acknowledging that three travelers who had been in Wuhan had ended up in hospitals in the territory suffering respiratory distress. One woman was being treated in Princess Margaret Hospital, which managed many of the 2003 SARS cases. Along with Hong Kong, Singapore and Taiwan also began conducting temperature screenings at airports and train stations, hoping to spot feverish pneumonia carriers before they could spread whatever the mysterious disease might be.

Then, on New Year’s Day, alleged medical documents appeared on Chinese social media and Twitter purporting to show that the outbreak was, in fact, caused by the SARS virus, which is a member of the coronavirus family. But by Jan. 3, Chinese authorities said they had ruled out several types of pneumonia, as well as SARS, noting that the mystery agent was not a coronavirus and bore less than 4 percent genetic similarity with SARS. Concern about another SARS epidemic was ill-placed, authorities said, and they arrested eight individuals from Wuhan, who now face severe punishments for “publishing false information on the internet without verification.”

**------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------**


avid Paulk, editor of the Shanghai-based Sixth Tone news website, noted on a page that has since been removed that the crime of spreading rumors can lead to seven years’ imprisonment in China. Last year, a man was detained for 10 days for “spreading rumors” on WeChat about a H7N9 flu outbreak in Haikou. In 2018, a man went to prison for falsely claiming that thousands of people had been hospitalized after eating tainted watermelons.

The reason rumors spread so easily is clear. As Paulk translated one post that has since been removed on Weibo, “People spread rumors precisely because the authorities didn’t respond in a timely manner, so how can we be blamed? Don’t I have the right to know the truth, be afraid, and try to save myself?” Another person wrote, “How is this a rumor?” on the Wuhan police’s Weibo account, according to the South China Morning Post. “This outbreak happened. The public was spreading information because there was nothing from the officials for an entire day.” The Post also reports that families of the hospitalized patients in Wuhan haven’t received information about their loved ones and in some cases don’t even know what hospital they are in.

Within a week of the initial outbreak in Hong Kong, at least 16 people were sick. Besides the airport and train screenings, Hong Kong health authorities have activated quarantine laws and placed all of the territory’s health facilities on high alert. Supplies of face masks have sold out, and Hong Kong nerves are on edge. One of the latest patients, a Chinese University of Hong Kong student, was removed from the dormitory on the night of Jan. 5, with photos and video of the event widely circulated on social media. Given extreme political tensions that have left Hong Kong in a state of protest for months, efforts to implement quarantine and infection control in the territory have already sparked rumors about the government’s real motives. As of Jan. 8, a bulletin put the number of cases in Wuhan at 111.

Meanwhile, in Singapore this week, a 3-year-old girl whose family had visited Wuhan over the holidays came down with severe pneumonia on returning home. Health authorities there have ruled out all known viruses and bacteria as causes of her illness and placed her in quarantine.

Alarms were also raised in Taiwan, but an alleged case of Wuhan pneumonia was misdiagnosed.

If these cases’ connection to Wuhan’s fish market are proved, and the virus that has caused this outbreak did spread from the facility, the mystery only deepens. There are no known fish viruses that cause pneumonia in humans. Bacteria, fungi, and parasites, yes—but not viruses. It is rumored, though, that the huge fish market also housed live snakes, wildlife, rabbits, and birds. The 2003 SARS outbreak began in a Guangzhou live animal market and spread from the slaughter of infected civets.

As a precaution, Wuhan authorities closed the market on New Year’s Day. Both Chinese authorities and the World Health Organization (WHO) insist that there is no evidence of person-to-person transmission of the virus (or whatever it may be), but a week after the closure of the market, new cases are appearing, their origins unexplained.

On Jan. 8 Chinese scientists informed foreign colleagues that the Wuhan pneumonia appears to be caused by a previously unknown coronavirus—a cousin of SARS  and of MERS (Middle East Respiratory Syndrome), which has primarily infected people and camels in Saudi Arabia. The latest information contradicts pervious claims that the mystery virus was only 4 percent genetically akin to SARS. If this is a coronavirus disease, it is almost certainly capable of being passed from person-to-person via contact with an infected person’s saliva, nasal fluids, or uncleaned hands.

CONFIRMED IMPORTED CASE OF NOVEL CORONAVIRUS INFECTION IN SINGAPORE; MULTI-MINISTRY TASKFORCE RAMPS UP PRECAUTIONARY MEASURES

The Ministry of Health (MOH) has on 23 January 2020 confirmed one imported case of novel coronavirus infection in Singapore. The case is a 66 year-old male Chinese national from Wuhan who arrived in Singapore with his family on 20 January 2020. He is currently warded in an isolation room at the Singapore General Hospital (SGH) and his condition is stable.

2. MOH has also been notified of a suspect case, who has tested preliminarily positive for the novel coronavirus. She is a 53 year old female Chinese national from Wuhan. MOH was notified of this suspect case on 23 January at about 3am. The result of the confirmatory test is pending, and her condition is stable.

3. Both cases were immediately isolated upon presenting to the respective hospitals with clinical symptoms.

About the confirmed case

4. This case presented at SGH Emergency Department with fever and cough on 22 January, and was immediately isolated. MOH was notified at about 10pm on 22 January, and the test results were confirmed for the novel coronavirus at 6pm on 23 January.

5. The patient reported that he had developed a sore throat but did not have fever during the flight to Singapore on 20 January. He subsequently developed fever and cough on 21 January. He was admitted and isolated at SGH on 22 January for further assessment, in view of his clinical symptoms and recent travel history from Wuhan. The patient was diagnosed to have pneumonia upon admission, and has been isolated since admission.

6. Prior to hospital admission, the patient stayed at Shangri-La’s Rasa Sentosa Resort & Spa in Sentosa and indicated that he had kept to the vicinity of the hotel.

Contact tracing commenced, close contacts to be quarantined

7. MOH has initiated contact tracing and nine close contacts of the case, who are his travelling companions, have so far been identified. One of his travelling companions has also been warded as a suspect case. He is a 37 year-old male Chinese national from Wuhan. 8. The health status of all close contacts will be monitored closely. As a precautionary measure, they will be quarantined for 14 days from their last exposure to the patient. Those who develop symptoms will be brought to hospital in a dedicated ambulance for further assessment. In addition, all other identified contacts who have a low risk of being infected will be under active surveillance, and will be contacted daily to monitor their health status.

9. Our public hospitals are geared up to handle the situation, and have put in place precautionary measures to screen and manage suspect and confirmed cases. MOH has also reminded doctors and healthcare workers to be highly vigilant, and maintain strict infection control and prevention measures.

10. Given the high volume of international travel to Singapore, MOH expects to see more suspect cases and imported cases. We urge the public to remain calm and vigilant, and to adopt good personal hygiene practices.

Taskforce ramps up precautionary measures

11. In view of the confirmed case, the Taskforce set up to direct a whole-ofgovernment response to the novel coronavirus pneumonia outbreak has decided to step up Singapore’s overall posture. This would include enhancing our border controls, including at land and sea checkpoints.

12. Singapore will also expand our travel advisory to recommend that Singaporeans avoid travel to the whole of Hubei Province, in view of the travel restrictions that China has imposed on Huanggang and Ezhou. MOH also advises Singaporeans to continue to exercise caution and attention to personal hygiene when travelling to the rest of China.

Health advisory

13. All travellers should monitor their health closely for two weeks upon return to Singapore and seek medical attention promptly if they feel unwell, and also inform their doctor of their travel history. If they have a fever or respiratory symptoms (e.g. cough, shortness of breath ), they should wear a mask and call the clinic ahead of the visit.

14. Travellers and members of the public should adopt the following precautions at all times:

• Avoid contact with live animals including poultry and birds, and consumption of raw and undercooked meats;

• Avoid crowded places and close contact with people who are unwell or showing symptoms of illness;

• Observe good personal hygiene;

• Practise frequent hand washing with soap (e.g. before handling food or eating, after going to toilet, or when hands are dirtied by respiratory secretions after coughing or sneezing);

• Wear a mask if you have respiratory symptoms such as a cough or shortness of breath ; • Cover your mouth with a tissue paper when coughing or sneezing, and dispose the soiled tissue paper in the rubbish bin immediately; and

• Seek medical attention promptly if you are feeling unwell.

I currently have a hospital full of people with influenza A, respiratory syncytial virus, human metapneumovirus, and more -- and that's just this week. This happens every year, people die in the hundreds and thousands every year, and you never see a single news story about it. 

Meanwhile there's one new epidemic on a completely separate continent, which the local government is actually being responsible about and appropriately instituting quarantines to prevent further spread, and everyone here in the US is losing their shit like the End Times are upon us. What exactly do people think is gonna happen? Is the PRC is going to send an army of sick Communists marching across the ocean to come cough in the face of every American? 

No. If the virus even makes it over here and actually starts to spread in even one US community, some people will get sick, they will go to the hospital, and most will survive. And, because it's just a coronavirus strain (meaning, it's really not scary-contagious), basic precautions including frequent hand washing and surgical masks are more than enough to protect yourself and your family."

> Three Chinese cities with a total population of 20 million have been put on lockdown and Beijing has cancelled a number of major public events in an attempt to contain the spread of a deadly coronavirus outbreak.

> Authorities banned transport links from Wuhan, the capital of Hubei province, on Thursday, as well as the nearby central Chinese cities of Huanggang and Ezhou, suspending buses, subways, ferries and shutting the airport and train stations to outgoing passengers.

> Chinese authorities initially played Sars cases down, and were subsequently much criticised because the virus spread virtually unchecked to 37 countries causing global panic, infecting more than 8,000 people and killing more than 750.

> Most cities have biolabs, so it's not weird that there's one in Wuhan

As explained in the article itself, most cities do not have biolabs. This one was the first of its kind in China, and its construction was controversial. Your point is factually incorrect.

> Someone would have had to deliberately create and disseminate the pathogen

False. Also stated in the article, SARS has managed to escape from high security containment multiple times. It is possible that this new virus was created artificially, but that's what these labs do as part of their work. It may not even necessarily be a target to weaponize the material, but that's possible too.

> It's not suspicious that the disease developed so close to such a facility because pandemics tend to originate in large population areas

 Extremely weak and tenuous argument, but at least it isn't factually wrong (afaik).

There you have it. In conclusion, it is extremely suspicious that there was a high security biolab studying coronaviruses in the same city in which a coronavirus outbreak occurred, and this should be investigated. In fact, the fact that the lab isn't even mentioned when discussing possible origins is shady af."

**Third generation means that someone who became infected after handling animals at the market in Wuhan, China, spreads the virus to someone else, who then spreads it to a third person.**

The virus initially appeared to spread only by very close contact that would typically occur within a family, such as hugging, kissing, or sharing eating utensils, Heymann said.

**Now, he says evidence is accruing that shows more distant contact could spread the virus, such as if a sick person were to sneeze or cough near someone else’s face.**

He said there is no evidence at this point that the virus is airborne and could be spread across a room, as happens with the flu or measles."

> Global count of cases now stands at 622Regional health authorities in China have confirmed 13 new cases of the Wuhan coronavirus, bringing the total number of cases in mainland China to 611, and 622 globally.

> Is coronavirus more deadly than SARS?Scientists say the death rate of Wuhan coronavirus is not as high as the SARS virus - which swept through Asia in 2003 - but added that the number of people infected is climbing.

> There are currently no confirmed cases of the virus in the UK.The health secretary did however say that this is a &quot;Rapidly developing situation&quot; and he expected the number of cases and deaths to rise, but so far all fatalities have been in mainland China.

2020-01-23,Tyler_Zoro,conspiracy,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/eslg29/maximum_security_biolab_opened_a_few_years_ago/ffc6bzc/,"> As explained in the article itself, most cities do not have biolabs.

This is true, but misleading. Most major cities around the world have such facilities. China has a ... complicated history with bioresearch, though. To say that they didn't have facilities like this makes it sound like they didn't have facilities to perform such bioresearch previously, and that's not actually true. They just didn't have facilities like this, which was bad. China has specialist hospitals that perform research, but in order to get samples from other nations for study, they needed to have the internationally recognized safety protocols and equipment. That's what this lab is for.

> SARS has managed to escape from high security containment multiple times. It is possible that this new virus was created artificially, but that's what these labs do as part of their work.

That's not the implication of putting this post here on /r/conspiracy. I get that it's a valid option, but it's not the implication I was responding to. It's also yet another unnecessary introduction of new requirements. For this existing virus to mutate in the animal or human population and then spread in humans is possible without any external agency, intended or not. So there is no reason to introduce this additional agency.

> Extremely weak and tenuous argument

It's not actually an argument. I'm just pointing out that the initial idea that a thing we expected to see playing out exactly as we expected to see it isn't evidence of a new phenomena or some unseen agency. To argue that it is is the weak argument. Saying, ""you haven't demonstrated the need for your claim,"" isn't a weak argument or a strong one, it's just a factual observation in this case.

> it is extremely suspicious that there was a high security biolab studying coronaviruses in the same city in which a coronavirus outbreak occurred

Not at all. We know that China has been a hot-bed of coronavirus mutation in the past because of the high density of people and livestock providing an opportunity for disease to leap back and forth. That the place where this occurs is investigating that phenomenon in that pathogen is obviously expected. It's similarly expected that a future outbreak starts in that nation. The two are correlated, but not (directly) causally linked."

“He added: ""The result of that was that the world spent billions and billions of pounds on vaccines and anti-virals that will never be used. It is huge waste of money.""

But it's also possible this person may be in hospital for an unrelated reason; Not every patient is going to have the coronavirus, as from what I understand this hospital (assuming it is a ""typical"" hospital) services the entire local population and is not a dedicated infectious disease specialist hospital/facility. 

Also, with this situation going on, I'm sure it's easy to overlook a hidden camera or two. Clearly tension is high; It decreases someone's ability to search for concealed lenses somewhat.

SARS is a coronavirus that kills a full 50% of the people who contract it.

I'm not an epidemiologist, but based on the early reports I think the odds of this thing being anywhere near as deadly as SARS are extremely unlikely. But even if it only kills 1% of the people who contract it, that still means it could kill up to 70 million people globally if it's not contained. That's why China is going so ham to try to contain this thing."

They reported fourth-generation cases in Wuhan and second-generation cases outside Wuhan, as well as some clusters outside Hubei province. They explained that strong containment measures (closure of public-transportation systems in Wuhan City, as well as other nearby cities). After this presentation, the EC was informed about the evolution in Japan, Republic of Korea, and Thailand, and that one new possible case had been identified in Singapore.

2020-01-23,redditknees,AskReddit,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/et2i9p/serious_medical_scientistsprofessionals_of_reddit/ffe156d/,"Epidemiologist here: in short I am concerned but not overly worried although I am a Canadian living in Canada. My main concern would be for the elderly and young children who are immune compromised. In addition, those with chronic kidney disease, diabetes, and other chronic diseases are more at risk of infection. Had I been living in China, my concerns would be much worse but I feel for the people in the Asian countries, I can’t imagine how helpless they must feel. That said, there just simply isn’t enough information available to make solid causal inferences here. The WHO has reported the virus carries an R-naught of 1.4-2.5 which is somewhere in the ballpark of Ebola. SARS had an R-naught of 2-5. So for every case of coronavirus there is an estimated up to 2.5 people infected, that we know of but there is a lot of uncertainty. 

Viruses have weird behaviour and if rapidly spreading are also very unpredictable. Some viruses can live on hard surfaces from several minutes up to several hours or days. Some stomach viruses can live up to 5-7 months. That said the situation is very circumstantial. The epicentre of the outbreak is a densely populated area (as one would expect), expect spread to increase in the coming weeks. it was good practice for the government to implement quarantine procedures but it also creates hysteria which in itself is a public health threat. Right now you can guarantee that every country public health agency is on alert monitoring all ports of entry. The problems is the subclinical nature of the virus. Hosts exhibit no symptoms given the long incubation period. 

That said, Western countries as well as most European countries while still under risk, are at far less worry given the spread of the population and density of home dwellings and just fundamentally different cultures and ways of living. I would anticipate and smattering of random cases at major land ports where people have travelled but those are hopefully easier to contain. I would also imagine that everyone is scrambling to develop policies and procedures to screen suspected individuals. Though the virus may be able to travel across continents, it does not necessarily mean it is a pandemic unless it is able to thrive and infect whole populations regardless of the location. 

The media per usual is very misleading. Parts of me are also wondering if we are seeing a heard mentality phenomenon happening here. The threat of a potentially new deadly virus crops up and suddenly every Tom, Dick, and Harry are rushing to the ED with a small cough. This in fact is how situations become worse, because then you have already immune compromised people in a hospital exposed to more than just coronavirus if not the virus itself. There really is no way to control what people are going to do in a situation like this aside from declaring martial law and a state of emergency. A person is smart but people are dumb irrational bricks who act in desperation before knowing all the facts. I recommend keeping up to date only on official channels (WHO, CDC, PHAC, NHS, etc). Regardless, I don’t mean to downplay the situation, it is still a very real and serious threat to the people of China and neighbouring countries. My advice would be to make sure you have at-least the basic flu vaccine to prevent other influenza’s from spreading and also to boost your own immunity if the time comes. Make sure that you are washing your hands frequently (after touching door handles, common contact points, people, your face, etc) and avoid touching your face at all. if you suspect someone may be ill, keep your distance and maintain proper aseptic procedure (wearing gloves, a proper N95 particle mask). Avoid eating foods prepared outside of the home and keep your home clean. An effective way to kill viruses is to use a 10% bleach solution (10 mL of bleach in 100 mL of water) and put in a spray bottle. For stronger adeno-associated viruses, spraying the area first with bleach and waiting 30 seconds and then spraying with 95% alcohol will kill most viruses. Cover your face when coughing and sneezing by using the pit of you elbow. This will not only avoid the spread of a virus to your hands but also other surfaces. 

Im tired of writing now. Let me know if you have other questions. My background now is in chronic disease surveillance in public health epidemiology and I have aMasters degree and am now pursuing my doctoral degree. For the last decade I worked with adenoviruses, e coli, Noro, and c difficile so I have a pretty good grasp on viruses."

Só a pandemia de H1N1 teve, confirmados, 1,5 milhão de casos e 15 mil mortes. 1% parece pouco, mas esse vírus que agem no trato respiratório superior têm uma capacidade espalhamento assustadoramente alta e podem sofrer mutações muito rapidamente e surgirem cepas mais agressivas, por serem vírus de RNA.

E se essas epidemias acabaram não virando uma nova gripe espanhola, isso se deu em boa parte por causa da ação exemplar da OMS e dos órgãos de saúde pública nacionais. Autoridades chineses mesmo já isolaram duas cidades na província de Hubei, Wuhan de 12 milhões de habitantes e Huanggang de 7,5 milhões de habitantes, medida que pode ser considerada bem exagerada, mas eles sabem que a situação pode sair de controle muito rápido e acharam melhor prevenir, até por saberem a quantidade de gente que vai pra China diariamente, e aviões e transportes públicos são o paraíso pra esses vírus.

Então, por favor, não menosprezem essas pequenas criaturas, elas são sim MUITO perigosas. E se a situação piorar, não caiam em conspiracionismo, que sempre surge nesses casos."

There will be plenty of ongoing/waitlisted tests and negative tests that clog the system. So the ""real"" number lags behind.

The symptoms are not specific, it's fever, cough and maybe shortness of breath, like any other pneumonia, or flu. You don't know it's Wuhan Coronavirus unless you test it.

There will also be asymptomatic/milder cases that don't go to the hospitals, those are included in the ""estimated"" cases, which is way higher than the confirmed cases number. Those people can still infect others. That's why China locked down entire cities. *The decision is based upon the estimated number instead of the confirmed number. So saying that China wouldn't quarantine cities based only on 600 cases therefore it's still being covered up is not accurate.*

China already told WHO about an unknown virus on December 31th 2019. Then shut down the market on January 1st. At that time, no human to human transmission is confirmed yet. 

January 9th: Coronavirus confirmed. 10th: Gene sequenced and shared globally.

There's been 581 confirmed cases as of today according to today's WHO situation report. Out of those, 571 have been in China. And out of those, 96 have been severely ill. That means that this little virus has put ~15-20% of people who get it in the ICU. The vast majority of those were before we knew what was going on. 

All that said, it's still a very small number of infected people, and very few hospital based outbreaks, which means that it either isn't great at spreading from one person to the next, or that fairly simple precautions (like hand washing and minimizing exposure) can stop it."

There have been reports all over that early symptoms are identical to common flu. Put yourself in their shoes. There's an epidemic going all around and suddenly you catch a cough and have high fever. Will you place your bet on it just being common cold and sleep it off, or do you go to the hospital to make sure?

It's a terrible situation all around, but people going to the hospital are not the ones to blame here. The people have done the right thing given the situation, what's needed now is for the government to provide proper assistance. Even if no help is available at the time, at least the disease is contained. 

In fact, the kind of decision you're suggesting is the one that's dangerous and irresponsible here. It'd be so much worse if sick people decide to not go to hospital and risk letting virus spread to even more healthy people, no matter if its common cold or the coronavirus.

It was created off the back of the r/conspiracy sub which is where I learned of it. At that point in time the MSM were referring to it as a mystery flu like virus which it is, if you boil it down to basics. Hence why people displaying flu like symptoms are being flagged and put into quarantine. What however is interesting is the lack of ‘influenza’ in the UK. This is its peak time in January and February. Instead there is this. The difference between a corona virus and influenza is something that needs more attention. Whilst they both display similar primary symptoms they are not the same. This NCoV2019 seems to attack the respiratory system after a rather long incubation period (some are saying 14 days-that’s a long time) with influenza it’s a lot shorter and whilst it does attack respiratory systems it’s also going to attack everywhere too. Whilst I’m sure I’ll get downvoted as I’m not a qualified doctor, this coronavirus is more than the authorities are making out. It’s causing viral pneumonia and without seeing an X-ray or CT Scan of someone’s lungs I really can’t say anymore. We should all just remember that medical ‘words’ like pneumonia or anything that ends in ‘itis’ is just a description and NOT a medical diagnosis."

2020-01-23,mongoose_with_rabies,answers,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/answers/comments/ess9lu/can_products_shipped_from_china_ex_jewelry/ffcokgd/,"Coronavirus is an enveloped virus, meaning (barring major discovery) that it has to be passed fairly directly from host to host. 

(Viruses can either be non-enveloped or enveloped, where the envelope is a lipid barrier surrounding the virus, much like a cell membrane. This means they require water and a pretty moderate temperature to survive. Non-enveloped viruses are packaged differently without this membrane-like structure, which allows them to survive in a much wider set of conditions and be much more tolerant of sterilizing agents.)

Common colds are typically enveloped, which is why you'd need to have bodily fluids contacting mucous membranes to get sick. Norovirus (the cause of those outbreaks on cruise ships where people are all vomiting and getting diarrhea) is non-enveloped, which explains why it's so difficult to contain and causes acute outbreaks since contaminated material has to be very carefully disinfected. 

So if someone coughs a spit droplet into your eye or mouth, yes, it could be spread to you, but in most cases will have dried or cooled to the point that the virus is no longer viable.

(This is also one of many reasons why you should wash your hands instead of using hand sanitizer, because it physically removes both enveloped and non. Non-enveloped viruses are often unaffected by ethanol-based sanitizers because the mechanism of action is to break down the membrane on bacteria and enveloped viruses)"

Raza, pues con todo este desmadre que se tran del Coronavirus, pensé que sería util armarme un buen kit de supervivencia contra el apocalipsis zombie culero que se avecina estos dias, y pues quedó masomenos así:

\- Indicativo: COMPADRE

\- Locación: toda la republica mexicana

\- Grito de guerra: Fierro pariente

\- Ultimas palabras: chingue su madre el america

\- Arma princípal: un cuernote de chivo ak-47 de narco, bañado emn oro de 24 kilates. si hay que matar zombies, hay que matar zombies con estilo alv (Ademas es un arma muy confiable)

\- Arma secundaria: Al arma de Han Solo (pa' disparar primero siempre)

\- Arma de pelea: El sable de luz de kylo ren porque, seamos honestos, todos hemos soñado alguna vez con partir zombies por la mitad con un sable de luz.

\- Vestimenta:

	\- Un buen sombrero como el de chalino sanchez, para el sol ademas de que se ve bien acá, estilero.

	\- Lentes como los de morfeo, de Matrix. al chile siempre quise unos desde morrito.

	\- Camisa del pri: infalible en cualquier situación, está comoda (100% de algodón) y ademas se puede usar como pijama

	\- Pants grises viejos y puteados, para andar lo mas comodo posible durante situaciones complicadas. 

	\- Navaja de tobillo, siempre util en combate cuerpo a cuerpo contra zombies.

	\- Botas piteadas, puede que tenga que caminar por terrenos escabrozos, estas son especiales para el rancho. ademas se ven chidas.

\- Inventario: 

	\- Hielera, super util para manetener bebidas y alimentos en buen estado.

	\- Carton de caguamas (indio) pa' la sed y por si se arma la peda con otros sobrevivientes que vaya encontrando en mi camino.

	\- Xiaomi redmi note 8 pro (la mejor relación calidad/precio). se que no va a haber redes de telefonía probablemente, pero un smartphone puede ser extremadamente util en muchos casos con todas las funcionalidades que tiene. camara, brujula, reloj, giroscopio, calculadora, etc.

	\- Kit de primeros auxilios (con un cingazo de paracetamol) siempre util.

	\- Generador de electricidad a gasolina

	\- Radio transmisor de onda corta, para mantenerme comunicado con otros sobrevivientes (y armar la peda)

	\- Caja de maruchan de pollo, seguramente va a haber desabasto de alimentos en muy poco tiempo, esta caja me puede salvar la vida en situaciones dificiles, ademas de que pueden durar mucho tiempo guardadas.

\- Vehiculo: ahuevo, una cyber ranfla, le puedo cargar la bateria con el generador, tiene una aceleración impresionante, no necesita combustible y en general tiene una pinta muy de apocalipsis zombie

\- Otros: 

	\- Fortaleza: sería en Ecatepec. estaría chido ver una horda de zombies tratar de invadir ese pinche lugar olvidado de dios, esa jungla de hormigon, suciedad y crimen donde solo sobreviven los mas fuertes, aunque como contraparte estaria complicado tratar de salir de ahi cuando todos los ecatepequeños sean convertidos en zombies, zombies brayans chilangos. que miedo.

	\- Compañero: aquí pense en poner un perrito labrador o husky, porque pues los perros son buen pedo, ademas de que ayudan y me vería como will smith en ""soy leyenda"" pero al final me decidí por el Bronco, a huevo. ese wey ya sobrevivió varios atentados, balaceras, etc ademas que es cagado por las cosas que dice, no me aburriria con el y al chile se vería bien chingon andar los dos matando zombies lado a lado, yo en mi cyber ranfla y el montado en su caballo llendo hacia el horizonte en un ocaso mientras destrozamos hordas de zombies, como plus: estaria vergas mocharles las manos a los zombies que se quieran pasar de huevos.

	\- Soundtrack: 15 boleros de oro, de los cadetes, para andar inspirado.

	\- Jefe final: Aqui hiba aponer al peje zombie pero al chile, se ve que está muy pendejo como para ser un buen villano, de hecho puedo asegurar que sería de los primeros en morir al tratar de implementar una estratejia de abrazos contra los zombies, acusarlos con sus mamas y esas pendejadas. al final me pareció mas apto el Trump zombie, ese we tambien está pendejo pero se ve que seria un buen villano (si es que aun no lo es), tiene todas las aptitudes para ello.

The situation is, as some people mentioned above, some cities have already been quarantined now. All the public transportation and infrastructures (like the libraries and cinemas) are closed. Almost every provinces in China has infected patients now. We are even told not to go to the family party in Chinese new year, 

All the four cities which own the owl team in China are big. The homestands will be a huge crowd. Both audiences and players can be easily infected under this situation. It seems that the coronavirus outbreak can not be well controlled now so we have no idea what it will be.

I hope everyone (especially Blizzard) can pay more attention on this issue. This is rly serious. But we will not give up hope. A lot of people are still fighting against it."

You were pretty close and the details can be confusing. Perfectly understandable. Fun fact if you’re interested in smallpox, camel pox is the closest related relative of smallpox. So maybe it jumped from close contact with camels in Egypt? Just an unproven hypothesis but interesting to think about. I would recommend reading “Demon in the Freezer” by Richard Preston to learn more about the eradication of and bioterrorism threats of smallpox, and his other book “The Hot Zone” for more about the emergence of Ebola. Both pretty interesting without being too dry. A little alarmist maybe but I enjoyed them. There’s a great infectious disease podcast “This Podcast Will Kill You” that covers all sorts of diseases. I’m hoping they cover this new coronavirus soon but the smallpox episode is pretty great. 

I will admit I don’t specifically work in Ebola or hemorrhagic fevers at this point, but they are my favorite to read about. So more of a hobbyist.

I'm an American MD and the last week has been particularly rough in our city without the aid of the coronavirus; my hospital of about 600 beds has been 90-100% full every single day with an additional 70-100 people in the ER.

If you take that situation and then added on even a small additional load of 100-200 sick people who need special isolation precautions and a high level of care, that would instantly overload our system.

It's not like all the heart attacks, gallbladder infections, and heart failure exacerbations suddenly go away because you have an outbreak of a new illness. In fact it's arguably worse because you'll have lots of worried people in the ER who in reality have a cold thinking they have coronavirus that will need to be triaged out, taking more time and resources.

Healthcare systems aren't designed to cope very well with epidemics, they're designed for predictable demand, and even small additional loads can completely overwhelm them.

The chinese government is an oppressive state and deserves no praise, but the problem is threads like this get filled with lots of redditors trying to get their anti-china hot takes upvoted, when really the problem is a lot dumber than all that; even a relatively small amount of sick people will overwhelm any modern healthcare system."

In the worst case, that horse is a pale one, and death is riding with it. Quarantine is either a disproportionate, crazy response … or it’s not. It’s a last resort. “If you’re closing down a megacity like Wuhan, which is also central China’s major transportation hub, it tells me you’ve lost control of the epidemic,” Gostin says. “It tells me there’s widespread community transmission person-to-person, and that all the things we’ve been told about this being essentially an animal-vectored disease with limited or no human transmission were either false, or information that wasn’t well thought out.” It’s hard to trust the official line from China; one local estimate now puts the number of cases at more than 6,000. Gostin worries that the epidemic is already out of control."

Lots of these cases around the world have turned out to be false positives since anyone coming from Wuhan with a fever is suspect.

 https://www.ijidonline.com/article/S1201-9712(20)30011-4/fulltext gives a very brief overview; it's short and not very technical.

We luckily think (but aren't certain) that it causes a milder illness than other dangerous CoVs like SARS and MERS.

What this would mean is that the snake virus can likely infect other animals of some sort but not humans. It infected an animal that was already infected with a different coronavirus that can infect humans. The viruses infected the same cell and swapped some RNA. Coronaviruses have proteins that look like spikes on their outer surfaces, and these are what actually bind to cells and let the virus get inside and infect the cell. The swap gave the snake coronavirus a new version of the spike protein that is able to bind to a receptor found on human cells, so now it can suddenly infect human cells. This is all very new and may not be true, but that's the process by which viruses that infect other animals suddenly jump to people and start causing a new illness.

We treat it with extreme caution because other illnesses caused by coronaviruses like SARS and MERS are extremely fatal - there have been about 1800 confirmed cases of MERS and more than 1/3 of those people died even with modern medicine. It's also extra alarming because there can be almost no symptoms from infection until you just die. A virus that causes similar disease but is also highly transmissible from person to person could be devastating - imagine if the flu killed 1/3 of people that get it.

3. In conclusion, a market crash is coming and it has something to do with Titanic, and cobras, rats, chefs, and bats. Ti...ti...tit.. Titenic https://youtu.be/G9DKoMSiDc4"

There are other coronaviruses that are much more deadly like SARS, which killed about 10% of its victims, and MERS, which killed 34%. 17 people have died from the Wuhan virus so far, but there were 500 confirmed cases yesterday and apparently around 600 confirmed cases today. The number of people infected has more than tripled this week. Currently, that's about a 3% mortality rate, but that number could rise since it's begun to spread much more rapidly in the last week so the number of people currently infected compared to the number of deaths is not necessarily a good indication of the actual fatality rate.

Some infections go that way quickly enough, others cause massive death tolls before then.

>Squared euclidean distance between the 2019-nCoV and Bungarus multicinctus is 12.47. The distance between the 2019-nCoV and another snake Naja Atra is 14.70. However, the distance between the 2019-nCoV and other animals is greater than 24, specifically 24.87 for marmota, 25.92 for hedgehog, 26.81 for manis, 27.47 for bat, 29.07 for bird, and 35.44 for human. These data suggest that the 2019-nCoV can more effectively use snake’s translation machinery than that of other animals, suggesting that the epidemic 2019-nCoV might originate from snakes. 

As in, this virus works really really well on snakes, so that's probably where it came from. 

I'll admit, after seeing more about this high-security lab, the only lab in China able to safely handle the new coronavirus, also just happens to be in the same city as where the outbreak started? It makes for a very good conspiracy theory. 

I'm not just that much into conspiracy theories, if there's 7 strands of Coronavirus that can infect humans and SARS jumped from bats to humans, they think this one jumped from snakes to humans and the epicenter is fish and animal market which sold bushmeat like snakes, koalas, bats, rats, then that's a good enough explanation for me, no need to invoke a conspiracy if everything can be explained with a more simpler explanation, Occam's razor.

Both are very similar Coronavirus’ and the situation going on around it is near identical, with heavy evidence that China has been lying about the number of infected people and potentially the number of deaths. WHO already confirmed they lied about transmission, as of 2 days ago it was confirmed by WHO that it can be contracted from human-human contact whereas China ASSURED the world it was only from coming in contact with infected animals. 

The issue here is we dont know the full truth of the situation and its approaching Chinese New Year where worldwide travel to and from China will be BOOMING. We got lucky with SARS in the sense that we didnt reeeally beat the disease, we more-so got lucky because it evolved into a less harmful virus than it could have. Can we really count on the same happening here?

Keep in mind im no scientist, but my science prof has spoken tremendously about this during the week and almost all my information comes from her.

I would definitely say people are overreacting when comparing to ebola (which really isnt as nasty anymore as it used to be considering a cure got developed in December) but at the same time people still need to act in caution or else we might be stuck here with a worldwide outbreak on our hands of a completely new and un-studied virus."

* Up to 6 percent in persons 25 to 44 years old.
* Up to 15 percent in persons 44 to 64 years old.
* Greater than 55 percent in persons aged 65 or older.

Considering the first case of SARS was in November 2002 and the press was only told about in February, 3 months later when there was 806 cases, 34 deaths.

Coronaviruses are single-strand (as opposed to double strand like human DNA) RNA viruses with a peplomer shell that links to receptors on host cell. The shape is where the corona name comes from. 

The reason why coronaviruses are dangerous is because they often have a relatively high fatality rate for a easily spread respiratory illness; SARS and MERS had around 10% fatality rate as compared to the deadly Spanish flu which only had 3%. If they became pandemic there would be a much larger loss of life than the swine flu from 2009 which killed 150k+ and only had a .5% fatality rate.

The Wuhan outbreak so far has killed 18 people out of 684, which is better than SARS but still a much higher fatality rate (3%) than flu."

Whoever said this has also said it for the sake of downplaying a disease.

If there isn't enough data to say it could be as problematic as SARS(shows similar symptoms, far more infectious according to MRC's 2nd report and causes quarantine of 3 cities so far) then there hasn't been enough data to say ""we'll be fine""

If you aren't a virology major, immunologist, a chinese medical expert or a member of WHO, then you aren't qualified to make statements like this. You are playing a dangerous game by downplaying the virus. NCoV has an unknown latency period, an infectious period at which time people are unaware of their symptoms and spread the infection everywhere they go. Depending on transmission type(unconfirmed mind you) this can range anywhere between HIV(intimate, fluid contact) to aerosol transmission(flu). 

People should take better care of themselves in the upcoming 3 months. Precaution is better than nothing. Don't go doomsday on us but don't downplay the severity of the situation.

Oh and

CONFIRMED IMPORTED CASE OF NOVEL CORONAVIRUS INFECTION IN SINGAPORE; MULTI-MINISTRY TASKFORCE RAMPS UP PRECAUTIONARY MEASURES

The Ministry of Health (MOH) has on 23 January 2020 confirmed one imported case of novel coronavirus infection in Singapore. The case is a 66 year-old male Chinese national from Wuhan who arrived in Singapore with his family on 20 January 2020. He is currently warded in an isolation room at the Singapore General Hospital (SGH) and his condition is stable.

2. MOH has also been notified of a suspect case, who has tested preliminarily positive for the novel coronavirus. She is a 53 year old female Chinese national from Wuhan. MOH was notified of this suspect case on 23 January at about 3am. The result of the confirmatory test is pending, and her condition is stable.

3. Both cases were immediately isolated upon presenting to the respective hospitals with clinical symptoms.

About the confirmed case

4. This case presented at SGH Emergency Department with fever and cough on 22 January, and was immediately isolated. MOH was notified at about 10pm on 22 January, and the test results were confirmed for the novel coronavirus at 6pm on 23 January.

5. The patient reported that he had developed a sore throat but did not have fever during the flight to Singapore on 20 January. He subsequently developed fever and cough on 21 January. He was admitted and isolated at SGH on 22 January for further assessment, in view of his clinical symptoms and recent travel history from Wuhan. The patient was diagnosed to have pneumonia upon admission, and has been isolated since admission.

6. Prior to hospital admission, the patient stayed at Shangri-La’s Rasa Sentosa Resort & Spa in Sentosa and indicated that he had kept to the vicinity of the hotel.

Contact tracing commenced, close contacts to be quarantined

7. MOH has initiated contact tracing and nine close contacts of the case, who are his travelling companions, have so far been identified. One of his travelling companions has also been warded as a suspect case. He is a 37 year-old male Chinese national from Wuhan. 8. The health status of all close contacts will be monitored closely. As a precautionary measure, they will be quarantined for 14 days from their last exposure to the patient. Those who develop symptoms will be brought to hospital in a dedicated ambulance for further assessment. In addition, all other identified contacts who have a low risk of being infected will be under active surveillance, and will be contacted daily to monitor their health status.

9. Our public hospitals are geared up to handle the situation, and have put in place precautionary measures to screen and manage suspect and confirmed cases. MOH has also reminded doctors and healthcare workers to be highly vigilant, and maintain strict infection control and prevention measures.

10. Given the high volume of international travel to Singapore, MOH expects to see more suspect cases and imported cases. We urge the public to remain calm and vigilant, and to adopt good personal hygiene practices.

Taskforce ramps up precautionary measures

11. In view of the confirmed case, the Taskforce set up to direct a whole-ofgovernment response to the novel coronavirus pneumonia outbreak has decided to step up Singapore’s overall posture. This would include enhancing our border controls, including at land and sea checkpoints.

12. Singapore will also expand our travel advisory to recommend that Singaporeans avoid travel to the whole of Hubei Province, in view of the travel restrictions that China has imposed on Huanggang and Ezhou. MOH also advises Singaporeans to continue to exercise caution and attention to personal hygiene when travelling to the rest of China.

Health advisory

13. All travellers should monitor their health closely for two weeks upon return to Singapore and seek medical attention promptly if they feel unwell, and also inform their doctor of their travel history. If they have a fever or respiratory symptoms (e.g. cough, shortness of breath ), they should wear a mask and call the clinic ahead of the visit.

14. Travellers and members of the public should adopt the following precautions at all times:

• Avoid contact with live animals including poultry and birds, and consumption of raw and undercooked meats;

• Avoid crowded places and close contact with people who are unwell or showing symptoms of illness;

• Observe good personal hygiene;

• Practise frequent hand washing with soap (e.g. before handling food or eating, after going to toilet, or when hands are dirtied by respiratory secretions after coughing or sneezing);

• Wear a mask if you have respiratory symptoms such as a cough or shortness of breath ; • Cover your mouth with a tissue paper when coughing or sneezing, and dispose the soiled tissue paper in the rubbish bin immediately; and

• Seek medical attention promptly if you are feeling unwell.

During the [SARS epidemic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_the_SARS_outbreak) they purposely tried to cover up the spreading of the plague and only started talking straight about how bad it was once it had spread to other countries and they couldn't cover it up anymore.

Hong Kongers who lived through SARS would remember how for the first couple of months we received constant reassurance from the Chinese authorities that this was a small disease and they had it totally under control.  The Chinese even bullshitted the WHO into thinking the disease was confined to one province when it had already spread far beyond GuangDong.  People only really started catching on to the bullshit when they noticed that a *very* similar virus had spread to other countries, and the death rates and rate of transmission seemed *very* inconsistent with the rosy picture China was pitching.

China's reaction to this new coronavirus has not been very dissimilar.  If you followed Chinese media, when the news of this outbreak first began to spread online around early January, Chinese state-media-mouthpiece CCTV explicitly called it out as ""slanderous rumours"" (造謠) against China and said encouraged people to beware of online slander.

Many Hong Kongers like myself are sceptical of Chinese data about the number of infected as well as the number of deaths.  We remember only too well how we had also trusted the reassuring Chinese-provided data at the start of the SARS epidemic, and how it turned out to be mostly lies.  Many of us suspect that China is still playing the exact same game as it did 17 years ago - outside of major cities, infections of the coronavirus will be reported as the common flu, and any deaths from such would be reported as natural deaths from old age.  If this is indeed how the Chinese government is playing it, the death toll could already be much, much higher.

The fact that China is now no longer trying to hide the outbreak and has even quarantined a city can mean one of two things.  Either the outbreak has gotten so bad that it scared whoever was in charge into ordering this, even though they are still under-reporting deaths and transmission rates to the outside world; or, alternatively, whoever was originally in charge has been swept aside by a more responsible figure from the Communist Party.

For the sake of China and the rest of the world, let's hope it's the latter rather than the former."

We already have a good idea where the virus originated and jumped over into people (it likely came from a specific market, can't remember its name).

Funerary rites are perhaps the most important traditions in Chinese culture/folk tradition.

And I believe it was this analysis that caused the government to open up and change their tight-lipped stance (the first US case apparently returned to the Seattle area January 15, he got ill only last Monday).

Two things: one is that many people may be infected but do not show symptoms (not a lot of testing is going on with asymptomatic individuals at present due to expense of testing but real-time PCR tests are now available), two is that the fatality rate (depending on the divisor used) is a fraction of MERS (30-35%) and SARS (about 10%); 2019-nCoV (the current name of the virus) is about 2%.

I am not saying they should not be preventing scenarios like that, however to blanket the country with bans on movies seems a bit too much. In the Wuhan area and surrounding environs YES. In other major cities like Shanghai of 24M that have had 10 confirmed and 9 suspected? That is a tough one. What about Nanjing, population 8M, zero cases?

Although Canada is the second largest country land-wise, only part of the country is really livable. Our federal government wants to have the population up to 100,000,000 by the year 2100, and sometimes I wonder if we haven't hit that benchmark already.

The last few months or so, it seems as if a hell of a lot of people have come out of nowhere in my neck of the woods. I've noticed an incredible uptick in Chinese people, in particular. I don't know whether it's people who fled Hong Kong, and decided to use their Canadian real estate, or if Trudeau has ramped up the immigration numbers on the qt.

For example, take the local casino. My elderly parents will go once in a while, and there has been an explosion in Chinese patrons. When the casino gave out rice cookers as a free gift, the line up all night was epic! Around Christmas time, the crowds were off the charts, and a lot of those Chinese patrons were sick, coughing over everyone and everything with their mouths uncovered. With this coronavirus outbreak, my mother said yesterday that she'll be staying away from the casinos. 

Now, combine the rapidly expanding population with hospitals already dealing with a multitude of issues such as elderly ""bed blockers"" who can't find an opening in an assisted care facility; ODs from the opiate crisis; people who use the ER because they don't have a family doctor; people who use the ER because they don't realize that a hangnail is not an emergency; and serious cases of seasonal influenza--everything adds up to a recipe for disaster. 

I can remember when SARS hit Toronto, and being thankful that I didn't have to take the Toronto-bound GO Train anymore. This current outbreak is rather reminiscent of SARS because many health care workers are falling ill with this virus also."
