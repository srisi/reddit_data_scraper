If there's one single positive to take out of the current situation, it's that it is really highlighting the cracks and creaking noises in the way we've structured society. The current system underpinning it demands, nay even *requires*, that as many people be working as possible in order to function, and without that shit gets wobbly. But even when people are working -- and some people like to point out how low unemployment was  -- many can still barely afford to make ends meet, let alone actually enjoy some of the niceties of modern life. And it's not even like they aren't working hard enough, some people are holding down two or even three jobs and still struggling.

Here in the UK, [Only 9% of people want things to return to normal after all of this](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/coronavirus-uk-lockdown-end-poll-environment-food-health-fitness-social-community-a9469736.html), and people have been enjoying cleaner air, more wildlife, better food and stronger social bonds. There's been a lot of noise about the mental health impacts of this situation, and the lockdown it has brought, but that survey suggests to me that if there is an impact to mental health, it'll be if things return to the way they are and people have to go back to sitting at a grindstone to justify their existence.

Fighters don’t have to fight if they don’t feel safe

At numerous points throughout the call, White repeated a similar sentiment: If fighters don’t feel comfortable taking a fight during the pandemic, White said there is no pressure – it doesn’t matter the reason.

White’s participation in Trump’s coronavirus economic task force

White said his confidence events will be able to proceed partially stems from knowing non-public details from being part of Trump’s task force to reopen the economy.

Locations are secret

White was not willing to reveal any details concerning the location of the next UFC event – or his proposed “Fight Island.”

Meeting with Nevada’s governor

White said he’s not sure when fights in Nevada will return. However, he made it clear one of his top priorities is getting the UFC Performance Institute and UFC Apex back up and running. White said he’ll be meeting with Nevada Gov. Steve Sisolak to discuss options.

Fighters who had fights that were canceled will get first dibs

As a result of UFC events being canceled in London; Columbus, Ohio; Portland, Ore.; and Brooklyn, N.Y., White said the fighters who missed out will be offered fights first.

If anyone is struggling, please reach out

At one point in the call, White paused to ask if fighters and their families were all healthy. The response was overwhelmingly, ‘Healthy.’ White reiterated fighters should reach out if they are encountering issues in the midst of the pandemic.

Coronavirus catchweights? Probably not

White said while he’s considered allowing catchweight fights due to fighters’ limited resources, he doesn’t like the idea. Catchweight fights have less meaning, White said.

Lack of cornermen access could result in fighters making tough decisions

White said the number of people that will be allowed at the events is still fluid. The UFC likely will have to limit the amount of people on scene, so White said fighters will likely have to make tough decisions.

Other tidbits

Americans may fight on “Fight Island.” “International Fight Week” in Las Vegas in July is doubtful. Medical staffs and hospitals will be readily available for every event. The goal is to have fights every Saturday starting May 9. UFC Trifecta meals from the UFC Performance Institute are on hold, but the issue will be fixed soon."

Edit:

 Never mind, it was from a report from The Lancert back in late January:








>As confirmed cases of a novel virus surge around the world with worrisome speed, all eyes have so far focused on a seafood market in Wuhan, China, as the origin of the outbreak. But a description of the first clinical cases published in The Lancet on Friday challenges that hypothesis.
>
>The paper, written by a large group of Chinese researchers from several institutions, offers details about the first 41 hospitalized patients who had confirmed infections with what has been dubbed 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV). In the earliest case, the patient became ill on 1 December 2019 and had no reported link to the seafood market, the authors report. “No epidemiological link was found between the first patient and later cases,” they state. Their data also show that, in total, 13 of the 41 cases had no link to the marketplace. “That’s a big number, 13, with no link,” says Daniel Lucey, an infectious disease specialist at Georgetown University.
>
>Earlier reports from Chinese health authorities and the World Health Organization had said the first patient had onset of symptoms on 8 December 2019—and those reports simply said “most” cases had links to the seafood market, which was closed on 1 January.
>
>Lucey says if the new data are accurate, the first human infections must have occurred in November 2019—if not earlier—because there is an incubation time between infection and symptoms surfacing. If so, the virus possibly spread silently between people in Wuhan—and perhaps elsewhere—before the cluster of cases from the city’s now-infamous Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market was discovered in late December. “The virus came into that marketplace before it came out of that marketplace,” Lucey asserts.
>
>The Lancet paper’s data also raise questions about the accuracy of the initial information China provided, Lucey says. At the beginning of the outbreak, the main official source of public information were notices from the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission. Its notices on 11 January started to refer to the 41 patients as the only confirmed cases and the count remained the same until 18 January. The notices did not state that the seafood market was the source, but they repeatedly noted that there was no evidence of human-to-human transmission and that most cases linked to the market. Because the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission noted that diagnostic tests had confirmed these 41 cases by 10 January and officials presumably knew the case histories of each patient, “China must have realized the epidemic did not originate in that Wuhan Huanan seafood market,” Lucey tells ScienceInsider. (Lucey also spoke about his concerns in an interview published online yesterday by Science Speaks, a project of the Infectious Disease Society of America.)
>
>Kristian Andersen, an evolutionary biologist at the Scripps Research Institute who has analyzed sequences of 2019-nCoV to try to clarify its origin, says the 1 December timing of the first confirmed case was “an interesting tidbit” in The Lancet paper. “The scenario of somebody being infected outside the market and then later bringing it to the market is one of the three scenarios we have considered that is still consistent with the data,” he says. “It’s entirely plausible given our current data and knowledge.” The other two scenarios are that the origin was a group of infected animals or a single animal that came into that marketplace.
>
>Andersen posted his analysis of 27 available genomes of 2019-nCoV on 25 January on a virology research website. It suggests they had a “most recent common ancestor”—meaning a common source—as early as 1 October 2019.
>
>Bin Cao of Capital Medical University, the corresponding author of The Lancet article and a pulmonary specialist, wrote in an email to ScienceInsider that he and his co-authors “appreciate the criticism” from Lucey

In the words of San Diego physician Jennings Staley, the drug hydroxychloroquine , approved to treat conditions ranging from malaria to lupus, was ""almost too good to be true.""

On his website advertising the product, Staley -- whose practice includes Botox injections, tattoo removal, oxygen therapy, and fat transfer -- cited President Donald Trump's recent promotion of a French study claiming hydroxychloroquine had overwhelmingly positive results in the fight against Covid-19 , according to federal prosecutors.

**The doctor would soon be charged with a federal crime.**

According to federal authorities, comments by the Southern California doctor about the drug's remarkable capabilities were recorded during a phone call with a concerned father of three, who contacted Staley inquiring how he could protect his family from contracting Covid-19.

**In reality, the man on the other end of the line was an undercover FBI agent conducting an investigation into possible health care fraud.**

According to a federal criminal complaint filed  Thursday and obtained by CNN, the FBI launched an undercover operation and made contact with the doctor in early April after receiving a tip from the public indicating Staley was attempting to sell ""Covid-19 Treatment Packs""  to the public.

**In an advertising email message reviewed by the FBI, Staley's purported medical package included dosages of hydroxychloroquine, antibacterial drug Azithromycin, antianxiety treatments, intravenous drips, and the use of a medical hyperbaric oxygen chamber. Staley offered to sell the items as a family pack for $3,995, according to the criminal complaint.**

During the recorded phone call with an FBI agent posing as a customer, Staley indicated the drug hydroxychloroquine ""cures the disease"" associated with coronavirus, according to the complaint."""

Another order, which goes into effect Tuesday night, will allow a limited amount of nonessential surgeries at hospitals, as long as those surgeries don't deplete the hospitals' supplies of personal protective equipment and allow the facilities to keep at least 25% of their capacity available for the treatment of patients with COVID-19, the illness caused by the new coronavirus.

A third order will allow state parks to open Monday. Visitors to parks will be required to wear masks and keep a safe distance from people outside their households.

You don't test that many people for the flu. You have to compare similar populations.

Flu death rates are based on how many people tested positive for the flu end up dying. People are tested for the flu once their symptoms get bad.

If you're testing people for Coronavirus that have no symptoms, you're biasing your results.

If you're struggling to understand the seriousness, ask yourself this:

When was the last time that the Flu was the number 1 cause of death in the US?"
2020-04-17,algoredumbledore,Anxiety,21,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/fj2y1a/lets_post_good_news_on_the_coronavirus_here/fnq3n5r/,"Hello! 👋I'm a bit earlier this Friday than previous Fridays, but I'm back again to remind you that you made it through another week! A lot has happened over the last week and sometimes the pace of change can be overwhelming. We have data on clinical trials of potential treatments beginning to come in, new cases and hospitalizations are slowing in many locations, some countries are beginning to relax restrictions on open businesses and other countries and regions are making public plans to do the same in the future. There really is a lot to celebrate right now. Every day the light at the end of the tunnel gets brighter.

Let's start with a study from the Oxford Centre for Evidenced-Based Medicine that suggests COVID-19 is behaving less like a traditional pandemic illness and more like a severe outbreak of a seasonal virus. This might seem obvious to some people, as we've had coronaviruses circulating seasonally in our communities for decades. The difference between those coronaviruses, which on any given year account for 10-30% of respiratory illnesses in adults, including the common cold (Source: [a research paper](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2759815) from The Journal of the American Medical Association), and COVID-19 is that COVID-19 is new and we still have a lot of questions. Its novelty is why we must implement measures to protect our at-risk communities until more is known about severity, spread, and immunity.

It's worth remembering that our current response to COVID-19 (social distancing, business closures, increased vigilance in regards to personal hygiene) is **not** due to it being highly severe but because it would be irresponsible to those who are in at-risk groups to let a new virus spread unabated before we know the best ways to manage and treat it.

But back to the study from the CEBM. Researchers looked at the H1N1 Swine Flu pandemic in 2009, as well as historical data on pandemics in general, and found that COVID-19 doesn't line up with pandemics of the past. In most pandemics, younger people are more likely to develop severe complications and die from the pandemic disease than if they were to catch a seasonal illness like influenza. To put it plainly, in most cases a pandemic illness will kick your ass way more than the flu or a cold and it doesn't care how young or fit you are. Now, months after we began tracking the spread of the virus and gathering data, COVID-19's risk for otherwise healthy young adults and adults lines up pretty well with your typical seasonal illness. It might kick your ass while you're sick, but it's going to do so like the flu or a cold is going to, depending on the individual (not to mention the question of how many asymptomatic cases are out there).

>In a pandemic, the proportion of deaths among the young should increase (See [here](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9652423/) and [here](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19423872/)), and [several studies](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3841239/) have further demonstrated this age shift in deaths to younger populations.  In a 1918 scenario, the major prevention strategies are to target [younger people](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18558871/) to minimize the loss to expected years of life. An analysis of three other pandemics over the last century also suggests pandemic viruses  cause excess mortality in ‘[unusually young populations](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20352125/).’

The study goes on to say that as of April 4th, in countries and U.S. states with at least 250 COVID-19 deaths, over 95% of deaths occurred in people >60 years old, and 50% in people >80 years old. These are a good chunk of the people we're trying to protect right now and it illustrates the fact that this virus is targeting the same people seasonal flus and other seasonal viruses target - the elderly and the chronically ill.

>The data support the theory that the current epidemic is a late seasonal effect in the Northern  Hemisphere on the back of a mild ILI season. The age structure of those most affected does not fit the evidence from previous pandemics.  
>  
>The outbreak does, however, fit with the  [WHO’s definition of a  Pandemic](https://www.who.int/csr/disease/swineflu/frequently_asked_questions/pandemic/en/)

(Source: [CEBM](https://www.cebm.net/covid-19/covid-19-deaths-compared-with-swine-flu/))

This should serve more as a reminder that there are people we need to protect right now while more research is conducted, but this is not the black death descending upon humanity. It is likely a seasonal illness that will be here to stay, but once we have treatments and a vaccine it will not trouble us the way it is troubling us now.

In other news, there have been some people worrying about supply chains and food shortages. A few meat processing plants have shut down for deep cleaning after workers tested positive and, as the media does, an influx of articles poured in that alarmed some people and gave them a new worry to occupy their brains - will we run out of food at grocery stores? No, we will not run out of food at grocery stores.

An April 15th article from Forbes reported that demand for food from grocery stores and food banks has increased due to more people staying home and cooking meals themselves. This new demand, coupled with waves of panic buying, has created pockets of temporary, local shortages in things like eggs, meat, dairy, and of course, our lord and savior, toilet paper. I say ""temporary"" and ""local"" shortages because it really does depend on when you check the store and where you live. It is variable and things that are sold out are likely to come in stock within a few days.

The Forbes article says **any food shortages related to plant closures or supply chain delays would cause these kinds of localized, temporary gaps in stock**, but that's what they are. Localized and temporary. The meat shelf will not be empty for weeks on end and it's likely your trips to the store will still result in you finding the majority of items on your list. Our access to food will not be gone, but our access to variety is likely to differ based on location and timeline. There might not be a specific cut of beef or variety of frozen chicken product for a short period of time, for instance, but beef and chicken will be available.

>There’s plenty of food in the U.S. with [hundreds of millions of pounds of meat](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/13/business/coronavirus-food-supply.html) in cold storage, the challenge is the lack of processing options (with facilities like Smithfield closing), which could result in less product variety, “We have a lot of pork, we have a lot of chicken, we have a lot of beef in cold storage,"" said Steve Meyer, a Kerns and Associates economist to [CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2020/04/13/business/meat-supply-coronavirus/index.html). ""We can draw on that should we have some shortages.""  
>  
>The food retail system is a [$1.46 trillion](https://www.ers.usda.gov/topics/food-markets-prices/food-service-industry/market-segments/) industry in the United States with American grocery stores bringing in [$650 billion](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/grocery-stores-carry-40000-more-items-than-they-did-in-the-1990s-2017-06-07) a year. Stores typically stock [40,000 to 50,000](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/grocery-stores-carry-40000-more-items-than-they-did-in-the-1990s-2017-06-07) items per location, up from about 7,000 in the 1990s. While there may be a lack of options for all the reasons mentioned above, shoppers today will likely walk away from grocery stores with everything they need—except, maybe, toilet paper.

I've spent 2+ hours a day reading the actual scientific papers and analyzing the direct data sources for the past ten weeks. It was very confusing but for the last three weeks the latest data and science has converged around the hypothesis that CV19 is much more widespread but much less severe than first thought. The independent serological studies from Finland, Scotland, Denmark, Iceland and Santa Clara all indicate a huge number of people have already had CV19, gotten over it and never even knew they had it. It can be completely asymptomatic or like a mild head cold in 60%-90% of people. That means the death rate is much, much lower than previously thought which is very good news.

> 
> The Long Island-based firm‘s flagship Medallion hedge fund has risen 24% this year through April 14, according to investors. The performance is thanks in part to a 9.9% gain in March, a brutal month for global stock markets. Medallion’s gains come even after its hefty investor fees, which include a cut of 36% or more of all trading gains and 5% of all money invested in the fund.
> 
> Medallion is only open to employees, former employees and a handful of people close to the firm. Because employees are the firm’s owners, most of the fees end up going back to them in some form. Before those investor fees, Medallion, which manages nearly $10 billion, was up about 39% for the year on April 14.
> 
> Funds that Renaissance makes available to outside investors haven’t done nearly as well as well, however, though they have rebounded lately. The Renaissance Institutional Equities Fund (RIEF), for example, was down 10.4% through April 10, investors say. RIEF has a longer holding period than Medallion.

A cloth mask is better than no mask. Don't buy N95 unless you immunocompromised, or elderly. If you get Coronavirus, Scientists say its the ‘viral dose’ you initially inhale that determines your viral load and if you're going to die or not. Remember young healthy 20 year olds are dying. Wear a mask and it will limit your initial dose and you'll only get mild symptoms, instead of deadly.

I don't usually sit and stare at the live feeds because duh, I'm in the anxiety subreddit that's BAD for me lol. BUT I can't help but notice that the media is starting to tiptoe into more positive reporting recently.

**Number of hospitalizations across New York continues to decline, governor says**. ""Gov. Andrew Cuomo announced moments ago that hospitalizations across New York due to coronavirus have fallen. Net change in total hospitalizations is undeniably on the decline. The three-day average, which is more accurate than any one-day number, also says the same thing.""

**Florida ramps up coronavirus testing with ""walk-up"" sites**. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis says his state is almost ""neck and neck"" with California in terms of Covid-19 testing. At today's press conference in Fort Lauderdale, DeSantis announced the opening of two walk-up testing centers in Broward County. 

DeSantis said that 43% of hospital beds are currently empty statewide. As of 8 p.m. ET Thursday, there were 774 Covid-19 patients in the ICU statewide, **the lowest number since April 9**, according to DeSantis. 

*My commentary*: Florida saw a spike in new cases yesterday that lines up EXACTLY with a spike in new tests, and in fact saw a lower percentage of positives. That percentage keeps creeping down. 10.3% positive roughly, which is pretty low in the grand scheme of things, and it's been that or higher for weeks. In my (uneducated) opinion, this is not the sign of an out of control outbreak. This is the sign of a stable outbreak that we're slowly discovering the scope of.

Finally, I know a few of yall in here really like to see this. More evidence pointing towards HIGH PREVALENCE and LOW SEVERITY: 

**Roughly 40% of French aircraft carrier personnel have tested positive for coronavirus**. Sounds like a bad headline, BUT: Dr. Maryline Gygax Genero, who testified before the French Senate Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defense and the Armed Forces, said all 2,300 personnel were tested for the virus, and 940 were positive. 

So far, **20 personnel have been hospitalized**, eight are on oxygen therapy and one is in intensive care. The personnel who tested negative are all in quarantine in military facilities. 

*My commentary*: 2% of cases were severe enough to be hospitalized. 0.1% (1) were severe enough to be put in the ICU. Of course my heart goes out to those who have been hospitalized, especially the 1 in the ICU, and there's no doubt that's a severe outbreak. But these numbers are significantly lower than what we see in cities because in cities, we can't test everyone like they can on an aircraft carrier. And what we find, almost always, when we test entire swaths of people like this is high prevalance, but very low severity. Comparable to the severity of Influenza. Of course this is a different virus, and not to downplay the severity of Influenza because that's ALSO a serious, albeit familiar, virus. But this is just further corroboration to the idea that the fatality rate is far, far, far, less than what we can estimate based on the limited data we can gather in the middle of the pandemic. In a few weeks we'll have tested tons of people for antibodies, and if a few years the CDC will put out a final estimate for exactly how many people caught it. And we'll have a much clearer idea then. But this is another glimpse into the actual severity rate.

All of this was on CNN's live ticker, which I don't recommend because I doubt the news will be good all the time lol. And I would link it but I'm not sure how exactly to link the individual stories but hopefully this works.

2020-04-17,Imnotsureimright,Coronavirus,13,https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/g36oqk/who_issues_warning_on_coronavirus_testing_theres/fnqtde7/,"Except the effect of a vaccine (and indeed natural immunity via infection) can be short lived. (Early SARS and MERS viruses resulted in short lived immunity, for example.) It can also take multiple boosters over a short (or long) period of time to achieve life long immunity. And even when that’s done, many viruses are prone to mutation. So, maybe you’re immune to Coronavirus but it’s the version that existed a year ago or six months ago or six weeks ago and not the version that it has mutated into today. This is part of the reason why we can repeatedly get colds and influenza despite being previously infected and/or vaccinated.

I strongly suspect that the WHO is not “retarded” when it comes to epidemiology and may instead actually be basing their statement on things like “facts” and “scientific evidence.”

Right now there is no evidence either way - there’s no evidence that covid antibodies imply covid immunity but there is also no evidence that they don’t. All we can do is wait and see. And hope."

1. Infections are under-reported 50 to 85-fold
2. 2.49% to 4.16% of the population is infected
3. The #covid19 death rate is 0.12-0.2%:

Here's why their numbers don't hold up

1. As of 4/17 NY state, population 19,440,469, has reported 226,198 cases.

At 50-fold under reporting implies 11,309,900 NY #coronavirus cases.

At 85-fold under reporting implies 19,226,830 NY #covid19 cases.

Respectively, 58% and 99% of the population.

Neither are likely.

2. An infection rate of 2.49% to 4.16% implies between 484,067 and 808,723 NY cases, both plausible.

However, NY currently has 16,736 #covid19 deaths and those counts imply a #coronavirus death rate of between  2.06% and 3.45% which is 10 to 28 times higher than the study.

3. With 16,736 #covid19 deaths and counting a 0.12% death rate implies 13,946,667 infections - 72% of NY's population. 

A 0.2% death implies 8,368,000 infections or 43% of NY's population and nearly the entire population of NYC.

Infection rates of 43% to 72% are not plausible.

4. NYC, population of 8,550,971, has reported 12,941 deaths.

That’s 0.15% of NYC’s total population and rules out the lower bound death rate of .12%.

The upper bound death rate of .2%, with an impossible 100% infection rate, allows for 17,101 deaths which NYC will surpass soon.

5. The study itself admits uncertainty about the tests noting the estimate of the population infected could drop to under 1%: 

""If new estimates indicate test specificity to be less than 97.9%, our SARS-CoV-2 prevalence estimate would change from 2.8% to less than 1%"""

Secondly, Mad fucking respect for Fauci for starting to lash out at some reporters that are trying to insinuate that he and Trump are at odds and that he's being ""forced"" Which really shows where these people are at and their priorities.

Third...The doomers are decreasing in numbers over at r/coronavirus. The top posts and first 15ish top comments will be acting like this is the T-virus but below those are hundreds of people calling them out, noting that that sub is hornier for the apocalypse than the guys watching that Bernie girl video.

And finally...as much as i dislike Sweden (grew up there) they have done this right, not in every way of course but they have done one of the better jobs. And more and more countries are starting to follow them.

These doomers will lose. It's a terrible time but that does not mean we can make terrible decisions. Thank fuck for this thread and the ones before."

The talk of a ""lost decade"" (echoed by the right-wing factions who also backed Sir Keir for leader) re-inforces just how deeply they hated not just Corbyn, but Ed Miliband and the soft left politics he represented too. Interventions such as this are timed precisely to put pressure on Sir Keir Starmer and remind him that it's not just Momentum and the socialist left, but the squishier and more liebral parts of Starmer's support within the party, that they see as the problem.

Blaming Corbyn for the behaviour of the factional right-wing he is such a key figure is a brass neck move, one that others on the right-wing have been making both inside and outside the party, but seems to be the line that they're taking. Now they've got the leadership and NEC there's no need to come across as reasonable, and since they take pleasure in goading the membership at the best of times there's absolutely no reason for him to strike a conciliatory tone

Finally, some of the talk about how we need to make ""equality of sacrifice"" and not use the pandemic to bring back ""old-fashioned socialism"" don't bode well about the future direction of the party. It seems they're going to fully buy into the ""who will pay for the Coronavirus bill"" austerity drive that will follow this, adopting a right-wing ideological framing about the economic consequences of the virus in much the same manner both Gordon Brown and Ed Miliband adopted the ideological framing around austerity following the financial crash of 2008."

I don't even think that most Turks understand the concept that *they are not responsible* for the Armenian genocide, what 3 degenerate Pashas in charge of the government decided 100 years ago is not who 80 million are today....but so many Turks take it as a personal offense and it sends a message that they support genocide or think its acceptable. The more they deny, the more guilty and an accomplice to the crime they appear in the eyes of Armenians. But the truth is, this is strictly a crime committed by the Turkish government, and it's crazy how the government dragged regular Turkish people and politics into this mess to try to defend itself from its own shameful crime

2020-04-17,knowyourbrain,Coronavirus,10,https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/g3g4lz/uber_driver_dies_from_covid19_after_hiding_it/fnr3818/,"An Uber driver has died from Covid-19 after trying to hide his illness for fear that he would be evicted if his landlord found out, a friend has revealed.

Rajesh Jayaseelan, a married father of two who came to London from India about a decade ago, died alone in Northwick Park hospital in Harrow on 11 April, according to Sunil Kumar, a friend of his.

The 44-year-old driver had “starved” for several days in his rented lodgings, telling his wife by phone that he did not want to leave his room because other residents might realise he had Covid-19 and he would be thrown out.

Kumar, 38, an NHS IT worker, said the fear was founded in an experience in March when a previous landlord allegedly ordered him to leave because he thought Jayaseelan, as a minicab driver, would spread the disease to him and his family. Jayaseelan had to sleep in his car for several nights.

By the time he drove himself to hospital earlier this month, his condition was becoming critical and he was placed on a ventilator. He died shortly after his wife and mother in Bangalore saw him unconscious in a final video call arranged by Kumar.

Jayaseelan is the third Uber driver confirmed to have died from Covid-19 in the capital, but there have been reports of several more. Zeeshan Ahmed, a father of two young children in his late 20s, died in St George’s Hospital in Tooting on Thursday. He had underlying health problems, a friend said.


“He is young, he left a young wife and children and he was the only child of his parents,” the friend told the Guardian. “He was a great person, very charming and full of life.”

Ayub Akhtar died last week of complications relating to Covid-19. Abdurzak Hadi, another driver who fell seriously ill, said the lack of clear guidelines and protection for minicab drivers left them highly vulnerable.

Some have improvised plastic barriers between the front and back seats, but many have not, concerned that doing so might breach their licence, Hadi said.

“We think that there have been at least six deaths of minicab drivers and there have been countless numbers ill, some critically,” said Yaseen Aslam, general secretary of the United Private Hire Drivers’ Association. “It is very distressing. The migrant workers in particular are vulnerable because they feel forced to work because they are not entitled to government benefits.”

Uber confirmed the deaths of Akhtar and Jayaseelan, saying it was “deeply saddened”. The Guardian has asked for comment about Ahmed.

“Our hearts go out to their loved ones and to everyone suffering during this unprecedented time,” said Jamie Heywood, Uber’s regional general manager for northern and eastern Europe.

Uber last month said it would compensate drivers with up to £100 per week for up to 14 days if they were diagnosed with Covid-19, placed in quarantine or asked to self-isolate.

Kumar said Jayaseelan came from poverty and had hoped to move his family to London but could not yet afford to. He would travel to Bangalore to see his mother, wife and children, aged four and six, for two months each year. He had been worried about catching coronavirus last month and called Kumar asking how to stay safe.


“That’s when he told me that his landlord had told him to leave because he feared that with him being a driver he could bring the virus back and infect the landlord and his family,” Kumar said. “He gave him immediate notice and he had to spend a few nights in his car.”

Around 20 March, Jayaseelan was admitted to Northwick Park hospital with dehydration but was discharged after receiving intravenous fluids, Kumar said. It appears that he went back to work and his last fare was at Heathrow airport on 25 March, after which point he fell ill again.

“He was finding it difficult to breathe,” Kumar said. “He told his wife he wished he had someone that could look after him even for a week and give him some food and take care of him. In the last week he really starved. He was in a room by himself and didn’t come out because he didn’t want people to see him [being ill].”

When his condition worsened, he refused to call an ambulance because that might alert others to his sickness and cause him to be thrown out again, Kumar said.

Shortly before he died, the hospital managed to contact Kumar, who arranged for a video call with his family. Jayaseelan died on 11 April."

Someone has to be last.  And being last/first isn't necessarily a big deal.    


The story gives no point of comparison.  If Kansas is testing  495 people per 100,000.  And the best #1 state is testing 550 people per 100,000.  I don't see the 45 test per 100,000 being that big a deal.

  
According to [https://www.vox.com/2020/3/26/21193848/coronavirus-us-cases-deaths-tests-by-state](https://www.vox.com/2020/3/26/21193848/coronavirus-us-cases-deaths-tests-by-state)  


As of 16 APR 2020  


Kansas has a testing ratio of 5,035 : 1,000,000  (Is last)  
NY has a testing ration of  27,039  : 1,000,000 (Is first)  


So NY is testing \~5.3 more times as Kansas.  Ok.  A matter of opinion on if that is acceptable or not.  Some won't be happy (as I've found) unless anyone that wants tested can get it.  But NY has waaay more than 5 times the number of confirmed cases, and deaths per million people than Kansas (for many reasons).  So I would really hope they are testing more per capita than Kansas.  Its a hot mess over there right now.  It kind of explains why Kansas hasn't been getting more supplies and help.  Even CA has a rate of  6,094 : 1,000,000 and comes in 46.  


Kansas is doing ok.  Could be better.  Might had been worse.  But lets not beat anyone up over it."

There are two police officers in a town. One hides at a redlight intersection all day, and every day he catches at least two people running a red light and gives them a ticket. The second officer always keeps his car in plain sight at the stoplight for all to see. Every day at least two people think about running a red light but choose not to so they don't get a ticket. The first police officer is not preventing any risk of accidents while the second police officer removes all risk of accidents. At the end of the year, the police station promotes the first police officer for successfully catching over 700 violations while the second police officer is fired for not catching a single person all year. 

It's difficult to calculate events that don't happen. The 2nd police officer can't come home and say ""I stopped two people from running red lights."" because they don't know that. The same thing is happening with the shutdown. People are saying ""This shutdown over 60,000 deaths is not worth it. That's how many die from the flu but we don't shut down over that."" Just like Trump said at the presser today, if we did nothing then a minimum of 1.6-2 million Americans would have died. If we could view a parallel world where no steps were taken then people could see that and realize we are taking the right steps. But since it is so hard to calculate events that didn't happen, the success of the lockdown is working against itself. Just like the success of our police officer got him fired."

Without more information about how op's life is financed police intervention could be disastrous.

> Mom doesnt work right now but John can work from home. 

That was the sentence that really stood out to me and gave me some concern about the potential repercussions of getting the law involved. Op did mention that they sometimes felt like John is a ""leech,"" but with the coronavirus putting millions of people out of work that may no longer be the case.

We don't know if the house they live in has a mortgage that John is paying, and if no one else is working and he were to get arrested they could literally lose their home. What he did was wrong, criminal, and should not be simply ignored and forgiven, but being homeless and jobless during a global pandemic with a 17 year old brother who might not have any good shelter options once he turns 18--that's not a good alternative either, and potentially much harder to come back from.

Maybe there is another family member she could move in with, maybe not. Did her mother choose John's side because she's a battered and broken house wife, because she knows without him she will be destitute, bc she is afraid of being alone and selfish, bc she genuinely agrees with him? I have no idea.

But I do know that in certain situations getting law enforcement involved can leave you worse off then the problem you set out to fix. Is John going to escalate things? History of abuse, or the only time he's ever hit a woman? 

I guess what I am trying to get at is that sometimes all options are shitty, but depending on the situation and looking at our present reality then yes, there could be a chance that keeping her distance and giving herself the time needed to get into a better living situation may be a better alternative than calling the police. The former prosecutor who made the initial comment was doing so because some people do not realize the full scope of what will happen after they ask for police assistance with regards to domestic violence. I've firsthand witnessed women call for help and then later deeply regret it because they didn't realize that police officers aren't coming out to play Dr. Phil, and employers don't like to have abusers working for them.

Op needs to make an informed decision based on her living situation and she needs to know what the potential fallout will be as well to make an informed decision in the first place. I really hope things work out for her and John gets what's coming to him-but hopefully not at op's and her brother's/mother's expense."

A male employee arrived at the door to assist, and the would-be patron threatened to take his mask off and ""give all y'all the coronavirus.""

I go upstairs to fix dinner.  My mom is watching God's Not Dead.  For anyone who doesn't know this is that infamous movie where Kevin Sorbo plays an insane atheist college professor who uses his position to punish students who believe in god.  Its hilariously bad and insulting and I'm there when she gets to that scene where he's ranting and that one brave student stands up and faces him and proves that god is real because the evil atheist professor has no real argument.

This in of itself isn't the issue.  Its my mom who can't even fathom why I find it so funny.  She was unironically enjoying the movie.  ""you hear about this stuff in colleges how they go after believers because they want to indoctrinate them""  Really??? Really you want to talk to me about indoctrination?  You're a mormon!  You made me take church class in school before I was allowed to even take drivers ed!  You make kids baptised by 8 years old!   Long before they can even think for themselves!  Don't even use that word!  And my mom is just annoyed that I distracted her during her stupid ass movie but I had to explain because I know her.  She's going to watch this and think atheists are all like this.  She even said as much ""you put me down for my beliefs all the time""  Except no.  You can't find one instance where I have.  NOT ONCE!  FUCK OFF you haven't even finished the movie and you already buy into this nonsense!

Oh it gets better!  I'm finishing my cooking when she comes in no doubt to punish me for disrupting her movie watching and just starts talking about the Coronavirus.  Just starts telling me how great Trump is doing because nothing gets me more worked up than Trump praise.  What follows is the usual heated argument where I raise my voice because I'm unreasonable in hating rapists and racists and generally shitty people in charge.  She would counter everything I said with every right wing talking point that she's ever been fed and a lot of deflection.  Boy does she love deflecting.  ""you think Fox News is bad what about your sources"" Always the go to response.  My best source to find out how shitty Trump is is listening to the asshole talk but thats not a good enough source apparently.  We go at it for a while and she brings up Clinton cause in her mind if i hate Trump I must be up Clinton's asshole.  Thats how it works.  I explain how I do not like either one either.  Before she even has a chance to bring him up I say I don't like Biden either ""well what other choice do you have?"" she asks.  EXACTLY the two party system is garbage!

At the end of it she got what she wanted.  Me getting angry over politics and her paiting me as the bad guy for getting angry.  And also don't fucking interrupt her watching tv or else!

Oh and she ended it all with ""you're lucky we don't kick you out"" which is her way of stopping the argument when she's had enough and ""saying stop talking and agree with me or we will!""

So every single shitty thing you can imagine about Trump supporters is 100% true in my mother.  Oh and also she wants money because I got my tax return and she's broke.  So she stopped being a parent in that instance and became my landlord."

We knew the Chinese version of the emergence of the coronavirus was increasingly under attack, but here is a thesis that tells a completely different story about the Covid-19 pandemic, which is already responsible for more than 120,000 deaths worldwide. According to Professor Luc Montagnier, winner of the 2008 Nobel Prize in Medicine for having ""co-discovered"" HIV as the cause of the AIDS epidemic with François Barré-Sinoussi, today he claims that SARS-CoV-2 is a virus that was manipulated and accidentally released from a laboratory in Wuhan, China in the last quarter of 2019. According to Prof. Montagnier, this laboratory, which is known to work on coronaviruses, has sought to use one of these viruses as an HIV vector in the search for an AIDS vaccine!

""With my colleague, the bio-mathematician Jean-Claude Perez, we looked closely at the description of the genome of this RNA virus,"" explained Luc Montagnier, interviewed by Dr Jean-François Lemoine for the daily audio journal Pourquoi Docteur, adding that others had already explored this avenue: ""Indian researchers had already tried to publish the results of analyses showing that this genome contained sequences of another virus which is . . the HIV virus, the AIDS virus, but they were forced to retract, the pressures were too strong"".

""To insert an HIV sequence into this genome, you need molecular tools.""
In the face of these assertions by a professor, sometimes challenged by iconoclastic positions, particularly on vaccination, one might also think that these conclusions are coincidental and that the coronavirus examined may have been taken from a patient who is otherwise infected with HIV. No,"" says Luc Montagnier, ""to insert an HIV sequence into this genome, you need molecular tools, and this can only be done in a laboratory.

According to the 2008 Nobel Prize in Medicine, the explanation lies in an ""industrial accident"" at the Wuhan laboratory. ""The story of the fish market is a beautiful legend... The hypothesis is that this virus came out of the laboratory because it escaped its promoters, it's the work of a sorcerer's apprentice,"" he says, favouring the thesis that the object of this work was the search for an AIDS vaccine.

""The truth always comes out in the end.""
This thesis defended by Professor Luc Montagnier in any case generates ""reassuring"" information. According to him, the altered elements of this virus eliminate themselves as it spreads: ""Nature does not accept just any molecular construction, it eliminates these foreign bodies ... even if we do nothing, things will get better, but after many deaths ..."", he says, and he nevertheless suggests a solution. To stop the pandemic, Luc Montagnier says that by using ""interfering waves, we could eliminate these sequences"".

This is enough to fuel some famous debates! So much so that Professor Montagnier's assertions could also place him in the category of ""plotters"": ""The plotters are the opposite camp, the one that hides the truth,"" he replies, without wanting to accuse anyone but hoping that the Chinese will recognize what, according to him, happened in their laboratory. ""In any case, the truth always comes out in the end; it's up to the Chinese government to take responsibility.

People are scared simply because they are gullible and easily manipulated.

&#x200B;

In January I found this virus scary because it was clearly highly infectious, and it was past the point of containment and we knew it was going to spread all over the world, while back then we didn't know how deadly it was.

And at that point it looked like it was possible that it was some 5% mortality rate, or even 10% mortality rate, killer virus. And in January we knew it was coming and everyone is going to get it, and if it weren't like the flu then by now we'd be at war and civilisation would be on its knees.

&#x200B;

Late January and February happened.

&#x200B;

We started to see in February, funnily enough in the end, all along it's basically just a common flu. Which is what the press initially said without any real basis to their claims of that it was as deadly as common flu pandemics every other year. The press were wrong at the start, and then as the data changed the press changed to be wrong again.

&#x200B;

People who started getting scared in February and March was not because they understood anything, it's simply because they are dumb and the press exploited how easily manipulated most people are and turned the whole issue into a political football.

Media organisations have beefs with Boris Johnson, and Ferguson gave them ammunition. It's not about the virus, it's about politicking, it's about fear clicks.

&#x200B;

Edit: And this is the sort of track record Ferguson and Imperial have: [https://www.spectator.co.uk/article/six-questions-that-neil-ferguson-should-be-asked](https://www.spectator.co.uk/article/six-questions-that-neil-ferguson-should-be-asked)

(outline to get past any paywall: [https://outline.com/GPcr67](https://outline.com/GPcr67))

\- In 2009 ... A government estimate, based on Ferguson’s advice, said a ‘reasonable worst-case scenario’ was that the disease would lead to 65,000 UK deaths. In the end Swine Fly killed 457 people in the UK and had a death rate of just 0.026 per cent .. Or to borrow Robinson's words to Hancock this morning: **'that prediction wasn't just nonsense was it? It was dangerous nonsense.'**

\- In 2001 he fk'd up with Foot and Mouth disease and cost the U.K £10 billion in livestock.

\-  In 2002, Ferguson predicted that between 50 and 50,000 people would likely die from exposure to BSE (mad cow disease) in beef. He also predicted that number could rise to 150,000 if there was a sheep epidemic as well. In the UK, there have only been 177 deaths from BSE.

\-  It has been reported that Imperial College London’s model of Covid-19 disease is based on 13-year-old computer code, that was intended to be used for a feared influenza pandemic

Tips For Social Distancing, Quarantine, And Isolation During An Infectious Disease Outbreak

What Is Social Distancing?

Social distancing is a way to keep people from interacting closely or frequently enough to spread an infectious disease. Schools and other gathering places such as movie theaters may close, and sports events and religious services may be cancelled.

What Is Quarantine?

Quarantine separates and restricts the movement of people who have been exposed to a contagious disease to see if they become sick. It lasts long enough to ensure the person has not contracted an infectious disease.

What Is Isolation?

Isolation prevents the spread of an infectious disease by separating people who are sick from those who are not. It lasts as long as the disease is contagious.

What To Expect: Typical Reactions

Everyone reacts differently to stressful situations such as an infectious disease outbreak that requires social distancing, quarantine, or isolation. People may feel:

•	⁠Anxiety, worry, or fear related to:
•	⁠Your own health status
•	⁠The health status of others whom you may have exposed to the disease
•	⁠The resentment that your friends and family may feel if they need to go into quarantine as a result of contact with you
•	⁠The experience of monitoring yourself, or being monitored by others for signs and symptoms of the disease
•	⁠Time taken off from work and the potential loss of income and job security
•	⁠The challenges of securing things you need, such as groceries and personal care items
•	⁠Concern about being able to effectively care for children or others in your care
•	⁠Uncertainty or frustration about how long you will need to remain in this situation, and uncertainty about the future
•	⁠Loneliness associated with feeling cut off from the world and from loved ones
•	⁠Anger if you think you were exposed to the disease because of others’ negligence
•	⁠Boredom and frustration because you may not be able to work or engage in regular day-to-day activities
•	⁠Uncertainty or ambivalence about the situation
•	⁠A desire to use alcohol or drugs to cope
•	⁠Symptoms of depression, such as feelings of hopelessness, changes in appetite, or sleeping too little or too much
•	⁠Symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), such as intrusive distressing memories, flashbacks (reliving the event), nightmares, changes in thoughts and mood, and being easily startled.

Ways To Support Yourself During Social Distancing, Quarantine, and Isolation

UNDERSTAND THE RISK

Consider the real risk of harm to yourself and others around you. The public perception of risk during a situation such as an infectious disease outbreak is often inaccurate. Media coverage may create the impression that people are in immediate danger when really the risk for infection may be very low. Take steps to get the facts:

•	⁠Stay up to date on what is happening, while limiting your media exposure. Avoid watching or listening to news reports 24/7 since this tends to increase anxiety and worry. Remember that children are especially affected by what they hear and see on television.
•	⁠Look to credible sources for information on the infectious disease outbreak.

BE YOUR OWN ADVOCATE

Speaking out about your needs is particularly important if you are in quarantine, since you may not be in a hospital or other facility where your basic needs are met. Ensure you have what you need to feel safe, secure, and comfortable.

•	⁠Work with local, state, or national health officials to find out how you can arrange for groceries and toiletries to be delivered to your home as needed.
•	⁠Inform health care providers or health authorities of any needed medications and work with them to ensure that you continue to receive those medications.

EDUCATE YOURSELF

Health care providers and health authorities should provide information on the disease, its diagnosis, and treatment.

•	⁠Do not be afraid to ask questions—clear communication with a health care provider may help reduce any distress associated with social distancing, quarantine, or isolation.
•	⁠Ask for written information when available.
•	⁠Ask a family member or friend to obtain information in the event that you are unable to secure this information on your own.

WORK WITH YOUR EMPLOYER TO REDUCE FINANCIAL STRESS

If you’re unable to work during this time, you may experience stress related to your job status or financial situation.

•	⁠Provide your employer with a clear explanation of why you are away from work.
•	⁠Contact the U.S. Department of Labor tollfree at 1-866-487-2365 about the Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA), which allows U.S. employees up to 12 weeks of unpaid leave for serious medical conditions, or to care for a family member with a serious medical condition.
•	⁠Contact your utility providers, cable and Internet provider, and other companies from whom you get monthly bills to explain your situation and request alternative bill payment arrangements as needed.

CONNECT WITH OTHERS

Reaching out to people you trust is one of the best ways to reduce anxiety, depression, loneliness, and boredom during social distancing, quarantine, and isolation. You can:

•	⁠Use the telephone, email, text messaging, and social media to connect with friends, family, and others.
•	⁠Talk “face to face” with friends and loved ones using Skype or FaceTime.
•	⁠If approved by health authorities and your health care providers, arrange for your friends and loved ones to bring you newspapers, movies, and books.
•	⁠Sign up for emergency alerts via text or email to ensure you get updates as soon as they are available.
•	⁠Call SAMHSA’s free 24-hour Disaster Distress Helpline at 1-800-985-5990, if you feel lonely or need support.
•	⁠Use the Internet, radio, and television to keep up with local, national, and world events.
•	⁠If you need to connect with someone because of an ongoing alcohol or drug problem, consider calling your local Alcoholics Anonymous or Narcotics Anonymous offices.

TALK TO YOUR DOCTOR

If you are in a medical facility, you may have access to health care providers who can answer your questions. However, if you are quarantined at home, and you’re worried about physical symptoms you or your loved ones may be experiencing, call your doctor or other health care provider:

•	⁠Ask your provider whether it would be possible to schedule remote appointments via Skype or FaceTime for mental health, substance use, or physical health needs.

USE PRACTICAL WAYS TO COPE AND RELAX

•	⁠Relax your body often by doing things that work for you-take deep breaths, stretch, meditate or pray, or engage in activities you enjoy.
•	⁠Pace yourself between stressful activities, and do something fun after a hard task.
•	⁠Talk about your experiences and feelings to loved ones and friends, if you find it helpful.
•	⁠Maintain a sense of hope and positive thinking; consider keeping a journal where you write down things you are grateful for or that are going well

1. Infections are under-reported 50 to 85-fold
2. 2.49% to 4.16% of the population is infected
3. The #covid19 death rate is 0.12-0.2%:

Here's why their numbers don't hold up

1. As of 4/17 NY state, population 19,440,469, has reported 226,198 cases.

At 50-fold under reporting implies 11,309,900 NY #coronavirus cases.

At 85-fold under reporting implies 19,226,830 NY #covid19 cases.

Respectively, 58% and 99% of the population.

Neither are likely.

2. An infection rate of 2.49% to 4.16% implies between 484,067 and 808,723 NY cases, both plausible.

However, NY currently has 16,736 #covid19 deaths and those counts imply a #coronavirus death rate of between  2.06% and 3.45% which is 10 to 28 times higher than the study.

3. With 16,736 #covid19 deaths and counting a 0.12% death rate implies 13,946,667 infections - 72% of NY's population. 

A 0.2% death implies 8,368,000 infections or 43% of NY's population and nearly the entire population of NYC.

Infection rates of 43% to 72% are not plausible.

4. NYC, population of 8,550,971, has reported 12,941 deaths.

That’s 0.15% of NYC’s total population and rules out the lower bound death rate of .12%.

The upper bound death rate of .2%, with an impossible 100% infection rate, allows for 17,101 deaths which NYC will surpass soon.

5. The study itself admits uncertainty about the tests noting the estimate of the population infected could drop to under 1%:

>Anthony Fauci

>, the nation’s leading infectious disease expert, said Thursday evening that diseases like the novel coronavirus “don’t just disappear.”

>Fauci was asked during an interview with Fox News host Laura Ingraham

>if COVID-19 could ""disappear"" like SARS did in 2004. 

>“Anything could, Laura, but I must say that the degree of efficiency of transmissibility of this is really unprecedented in anything that I’ve seen. It’s an extraordinarily efficient virus in transmitting from one person to another,” Fauci said. “These kinds of viruses don’t just disappear.”

>Earlier in the interview, Ingraham asked why the U.S. is “pegging on going back to normal with a vaccine,” when that wasn’t the case for SARS or HIV/AIDS.

>Fauci said it’s inefficient to compare the current pandemic to HIV/AIDS or SARS because the diseases behave differently, calling the rate of transmission in COVID-19 “unprecedented.”

>“This is different,” Fauci said. “...So I think it’s a little misleading maybe to compare what we’re going through now with HIV or SARS, they’re really different.”

>Fauci has previously come under criticism for exercising caution when discussing the public health risks of reopening the economy fully. The doctor has said that there needs to be a vigorous increase in testing in the United States before the country can think about a phased approach to reopening and a vaccine needs to be created. 

>On Saturday Republican Reps. Andy Biggs (Ariz.) and Ken Buck (Colo.) criticized Fauci, saying his excess of caution and recommendations to the president could do serious damage to the U.S. economy now and in the future.

>“For Fauci, is it merely a societal or economic inconvenience that about 17 million workers are unemployed because of the government’s response to the coronavirus pandemic, with many more to come in the weeks and months ahead? The economic calamity lies largely with the origination of policies resulting from Fauci's recommendations,” the lawmakers wrote in an op-ed in the Washington Examiner published Saturday."

These governments need to be held accountable for their failures and short comings. They knew the trends that were being shown in countries and failed to act quickly enough. The situation in UK regarding PPE is nothing short of shambolic. The government again need to be help accountable. 

Once this is all done, I sincerely hope all these doctors and nurses are given the respect they deserve. Some patients treat them like absolute dirt, hopefully that will change.

""After relaxing social distancing measures, San Francisco faced a long second wave of deaths.""


""St. Louis had strong social distancing measures and a low total death rate. The city successfully delayed its peak in deaths, but faced a sharp increase when restrictions were temporarily relaxed.""

""The studies reached another important conclusion: That relaxing intervention measures too early could cause an otherwise stabilized city to relapse. St. Louis, for example, was so emboldened by its low death rate that the city lifted restrictions on public gatherings less than two months after the outbreak began. A rash of new cases soon followed. Of the cities that kept interventions in place, none experienced a second wave of high death rates.""

https://www.cdc.gov/flu/pandemic-resources/1918-commemoration/three-waves.htm

The pandemic peaked in the U.S. during the second wave, in the fall of 1918. This highly fatal second wave was responsible for most of the U.S. deaths attributed to the pandemic.

https://www.contagionlive.com/news/analysis-spanish-flu-pandemic-proves-social-distancing-works

“The duration that these ‘social distancing’ measures were kept in place correlated with a reduced total mortality burden,” he writes. “Although we still have no known effective therapy or vaccine prevention for this coronavirus, and the world is a quite different place than it was 100 years ago, the efficacy of the measures instituted during the 1918-19 pandemic gives us hope that the current measures will also limit the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.”

https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2020/3/24/21188121/coronavirus-covid-19-social-distancing-1918-spanish-flu

""Another point worth emphasizing from the research: Social distancing practices have to be sustained. As obstructive as it is that we might need to do some social distancing for months, that really might be what’s necessary to save as many lives as possible.

Markel’s study demonstrates this: As the pandemic appeared to subside, St. Louis pulled back its social distancing measures. But it turned out that the pullback was premature — and flu deaths started to rise once again. This graph shows that, with the line chart tracking flu deaths over time and the black and gray bars below showing when key social distancing measures were in place:""

""In a lot of cities, similar premature pullbacks produced a lot of “double-humped epi curves,” as Markel described them: Officials instituted social distancing measures, saw flu cases fall, then pulled back the measures, saw flu cases rise again, and reactivated the measures.

Notably, the second spike in deaths only appeared when cities removed social distancing measures, Markel’s study found: “Among the 43 cities, we found no example of a city that had a second peak of influenza while the first set of nonpharmaceutical interventions were still in effect.”""

Think first. Research second. Type third.

I also never mentioned anything about a ""global shutdown."" I stated ""*cities* started reopening too soon."" So nice strawman as well.

Good day."

2020-04-17,fishball_7204,AusFinance,8,https://www.reddit.com/r/AusFinance/comments/g2u8r6/home_prices_to_plunge_20pc_cba/fnnyouz/,"Australia's largest lender Commonwealth Bank has downgraded its home price targets for the next six months, citing a short-term but deep economic hit from coronavirus restrictions.

The bank says residential property prices will drop by 10 per cent over six months or 20 per cent on annualised basis, led by steep falls in Sydney and Melbourne.


CBA expects Melbourne home prices to fall by 11 per cent and Sydney by 10 per cent in the next six months due to rising unemployment.

Melbourne's housing market is expected to cop the biggest decline of 11 per cent, while Sydney and Canberra are set to fall by 10 per cent each over the same period.

Brisbane, Adelaide and Hobart markets are expected to drop by 8 per cent each while Perth is forecast to slide by 7 per cent.

CBA's head of Australian economics Gareth Aird said the government's response to limit the spread of COVID-19 has created a plunge in economic activity and a spike in unemployment.

""This will have profound short term consequences for the housing market,"" he said.

""As a result, we have materially downwardly revised our expectations for Australian residential property prices.

""It is our view that prices will fall sharply over the next six months.""

CBA is expecting the market to recoup some of the losses by the end of the year, but home prices in Melbourne were still set to slide by 8.4 per cent and in Sydney by 6.4 per cent.

""We expect both Sydney and Melbourne to underperform relative to the national benchmark,"" Mr Aird said.

""Both NSW and Victoria have more exposure to the most heavily impacted services sectors and less exposure to the more insulated sectors such as agriculture and mining.

""In addition, the Sydney and Melbourne housing markets are more impacted by the abrupt temporary halt to net overseas migration as well as the expected fall in foreign demand.""

Nationally, the bank is expecting house prices to drop by 7 per cent.

CBA's forecast is a dramatic reversal from its rosier expectation of a 6.1 per cent price growth for 2020 in November last year.

This comes after investment bank UBS forecast a 10 per cent drop in housing values in the coming year in line with their pandemic scenario.

Unemployment, consumer sentiment and migration
Mr Aird said the rapid rise in unemployment caused by the government shutdown is a big shock to the labour market and will put significant downward pressure on home prices.

The surge in unemployment is also expected to weaken rental markets at a time of uncertainty due to government interventions to prevent evictions.

These would act as a major deterrent to property investors over the next six months.

The collapse in consumer sentiment is also a strong portent of sharp price decline, Mr Aird said.

The Westpac/Melbourne Institute Consumer Sentiment report showed the number of households expecting dwelling prices to rise over the next twelve months has plunged to its lowest level since 2009.

""This index has historically had a very strong leading relationship with dwelling prices. If households as a collective expect prices to fall, then they will,"" Mr Aird said.

The foreign investment and international migration have been reduced to zero due to the border shutdown, which will also have a material negative demand shock to the property market, Mr Aird said.

""It will have an impact on both prices and residential construction,"" he said.

Best and worst case scenarios
Mr Aird said the spike in unemployment should start falling by the second half of the year, which will limit the magnitude of the price decline.

""This will mean the impact on the property market is immediate, but should not be as long lasting,"" he said.

""In a best case scenario government restrictions on economic activity could start to be lifted by the end of May.

""If that were to occur, the plunge in economic activity that we expect would not be as large and the impact on the property market would not be as severe, particularly given the extraordinary low borrowing rates currently on offer.""

If restrictions are eased and a second round of COVID-19 cases emerge, the hit to the housing market would be more long lasting.

""We would see restrictions return but the hit this time around on the economy and labour markets would be more significant and the damage would be longer lasting,"" he said.

""Falls in dwelling prices far greater than our central scenario would be plausible. We believe that policymakers will be acutely aware of the risk of this scenario and as a result they will take a cautious approach to reopening the economy."""

Calling out airlines for being irresponsible and not preparing for a crash is not mutually exclusive with feeling bad for airline pilots.

The airlines fucked themselves and their pilots over. No one could have predicted the coronavirus this year, but we all could have predicted *something* would happen *sometime*. A virus, a regular recession, a war, a terrorist attack, etc. The airlines spent money on something that had no tangible benefits for the airline itself, and left themselves open to risk.

But calling the airlines out doesn't mean that we can't also realize that pilots don't control the financial decision of the airline and that they deserve wage protection. Airlines are, for better or worse, to big to fail and we need some financial protections now. The government saved the banks in 08 and made a small profit, no reason they can't do that to the airlines.


People saying something bad about an airline's leadership is not an attack on the pilots."

You had me agreeing up until the end.  There is, of course, a *ton* we can do about it before either a vaccine is developed or it kills everyone it could.

Flattening the curve is all about making sure that our ability to care for the people most hurt by this isn't overwhelmed.  That is, if you get sick enough to need to go to the hospital there will be room, and if you're sick enough to need a ventilator there will be one for you.   Even if only 1% of the population (i.e. 33 million Americans) eventually gets this sick, having it happen slowly over a couple of years will go much much better than having it all happen in the next three months.

[Here is a CDC list of over 400 articles regarding incidents where lab personnel were accidentally infected.](https://search.cdc.gov/search/index.html?query=Laboratory-Acquired+Infection)

It's not some nut conspiracy to think that it could have happened this time. Especially considering that:

1. It happened in the winter, when bats are hibernating.
2. Bats are not sold in the wet market. Any animal carrying the disease would have to have been infected prior to being brought to the market, however the same contact tracing that pinpointed the wet market in the first place found no link leading to the outside.
2. [13 of the initial 41 cases had no link to the wet market](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736\(20\)30183-5/fulltext), suggesting that the virus was already circulating before being brought into the market and spreading from there.
2. [SARS-CoV-2 was found to be 96.2% match with a virus sampled from a cave over 1000 miles away from Wuhan.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7095418/) This kind of match in a genome as small as that of a coronavirus is very significant.
3. There are not one but two labs within a few miles of the wet market where this kind of virus is studied.
4. The Wuhan Institute of Virology lab was studying bat coronaviruses as recently as November 2019 (known through [job postings on the official lab website](https://archive.is/QU22i)).

We averaged about $20 a week for groceries, buying them at a store where you wrote the prices on the products with a red wax pen and boxed or bagged them yourself.  We still remember once having only $11 for a week’s worth of groceries... $11 for three people!  We bought enough baby food for a week and then food to last the two of us.  We ate a lot of Rhoades frozen bread, Mac & cheese, and knew that a single waffle with butter *and* syrup (at 1980 prices) cost $0.11 cents.  I often think living with those kinds of financial restraints makes one more appreciative of the better times.  Now, however, battling the coronavirus and unemployment for millions is a challenge that blows our 1980’s concerns out of the water.  Today I’m retired with a pension and my wife has a decent job that she’s allowed to work at from home, so we’re okay.  I wish everyone could say the same.

The near shutoff of subway ridership in Manhattan – down by over 90 percent at the end of March – correlates strongly with the substantial increase in the doubling time of new cases in this borough. Maps of subway station turnstile entries, superimposed upon zip code-level maps of reported coronavirus incidence, are strongly consistent with subway-facilitated disease propagation. Local train lines appear to have a higher propensity to transmit infection than express lines.

Under Xi Jinping's concept of ""Chinese Dream"" and ""The Great Rejuvenation of Chinese Nation"", China has breed a whole loads of nationalists which even [destroyed friendship](https://supchina.com/2019/12/19/nationalism-ruined-my-chinese-friendships/) between overseas Chinese and Mainland Chinese.

The country now sees itself as a rising power and want ""a rightful place in the world"", not so different from Imperial Germany's Platz an der Sonne (a place in the sun) or Imperial Japan's Hakkō ichiu (eight crown cords under one roof). It is becoming problematic last year when Chinese nationalists went violence in [Australia](https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/aug/17/pro-hong-kong-rally-in-melbourne-turns-violent-amid-clashes-with-china-supporters) and [Canada](https://www.blogto.com/city/2019/08/hong-kong-protest-toronto/) over Hong Kong.

China is increasingly seeing the West and Japan as blocking its path to be a world superpower, just like how Imperial Germany saw Britain or how Imperial Japan saw the West last century. In fact [xenophobia and nationalism](https://www.firstpost.com/health/as-coronavirus-pandemic-fades-in-china-country-sees-rise-of-equally-infectious-nationalism-and-xenophobia-8269061.html) have flared up as coronavirus fades in China, so much so countries who are usually friendly to China have denounced the behaviors. Things that happened that are not in China's interests are increasingly being blamed on the West.

And just to say, among China's immediate neighbors, it has problems with Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, the Philippines, Vietnam and India. Only when you are very strong, like Russia, then China dares not reclaim its lost territories, such as [Outer Manchuria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outer_Manchuria), a vast land lost to Russia just around the time Manchu China lost Hong Kong to the Brits.

Chinese online armies have long attacked anyone who posted the most trivial thing, including forcing a 16-year old Taiwanese singer [to apologize](https://qz.com/596261/a-16-year-old-pop-star-was-forced-to-apologize-to-china-for-waving-taiwans-flag/) for waving a Taiwan flag at South Korean TV.

This time their target is a [Thai celebrity](https://foreignpolicy.com/2020/04/17/nnevvy-bright-firewall-thailand-china-online-army/) named Bright who retweeted a post sharing photos of the skylines in four ""countries"", one of which was Hong Kong. This upset Chinese online nationalists, who hold that Hong Kong is part of China, and they demanded Bright apologize, which he did. Then, Bright's girlfriend, another Thai social influencer retweeted a Thai-language tweet questioning why China would not let foreigners investigate whether the novel coronavirus was leaked from a Chinese lab while at the same time accusing foreigners of having brought the virus to China.

This has those online Chinese armies go crazy. They begin to insult the Thai king, the Thai prime minister, and dismissed the country as poor and backward. But they were surprised to find Thais did not seem to care. In response to Chinese taunts of “NMSL,” which means something like “hope your mother dies,” Thais retorted that they have 20 mothers. The Chinese were baffled by this, and some attempted to lecture the Thais on the meaning of patriotism.

When all these has been made public, other Thais join the ""[Milk Tea Alliance](https://www.straitstimes.com/asia/se-asia/young-thais-join-milk-tea-alliance-in-online-backlash-that-angers-beijing)"" supporting Hong Kong and Taiwan. Moved by this show of solidarity, netizens from Hong Kong and Taiwan, as well as the Philippines, Malaysia, Vietnam, and other Asian countries that have long been agitated by Chinese nationalists online bullying, mobilized to join the #nnevvy war.

The Chinese embassy in Bangkok waded into the affair by insisting the ""One China"" principle towards Hong Kong and Taiwan, saying it is ""irrefutable"" and ""the recent online noises only reflect bias and ignorance"". Thais tell the embassy that ""One China Principle is only China's. Don't force it on others."" Seeing this, Taiwan's President Tsai Ing-wen tweeted best wishes in Thai for the Thai new year, which began on Monday. 

Even among overseas Chinese, the perception towards PRCs has increasingly turned negative. Between overseas Chinese and PRCs, they have a very different mindset. When Mao Zedong ruled China, he deemed the millenniums of Chinese culture as ""capitalist"" and ""backward"", and launched the [cultural revolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cultural_Revolution) eliminating the traditional Chinese-Confucianist values and replaced it with ""Mao Zedong Thoughts"" (or Maoism). The PRCs are brought up with Maoist Marxist-Leninsm thought while overseas Chinese maintain Chinese-Confucianist culture that is actually closer to the Japanese, South Korean, Hong Kongers and Taiwanese. As if that is not enough, now you have ""[Xi Jinping Thoughts](https://www.scmp.com/news/china/policies-politics/article/2116504/brains-chinas-children-xi-jinpings-thought-become)"" which is to be made compulsory in China schools.

One year ago, the Hong Kong protest has split Mainland and overseas Chinese, now with the even more aggressive  nationalism from China amid coronavirus, overseas Chinese are reportedly [distancing themselves](https://mercatornet.com/overseas-chinese-are-distancing-themselves-from-the-communist-mainland/47575/) from Communist China. 

The CCP has always claimed that it brings China into economic prosperity after a century of turmoil, but economic development has always been part of Chinese characters. For the past 2,000 years, during the Han, Tang, Ming and early Qing dynasties, China was the world's biggest economy. Histories has shown that since the unification of China under the First Emperor, given a stable environment the Chinese will always build up a vibrant economy within 50 years. This happened in Singapore, Taiwan and Hong Kong post-WWII, The last turmoil in China, Great Chinese Famine - Great Leap Forward - Cultural Revolution, ended in 1976, so the 50-year timeframe is right about time, regardless of whether there is a CCP or not."

> ""what is holocaust denial even about? Why are there people that think it never happened?""

It's not so much that we don't think there was mass murder of Jews; we just find the propagandized narrative to be completely absurd.

We question the number, which isn't allowed. We question the method, which isn't allowed. We question the means and motive, which isn't allowed. We question the timing and resources, which isn't allowed. And on and on.

The Holocaust is the only historic event that is beyond questioning. Either you accept that six million Jews and five million others were systematically executed in death camps across German territory over the course of just a few short years during a multi-front global war, or you're an evil person that needs to be deplatformed. You must accept that, during the peak of war where resources were scarce and under constant bombardment, the Nazis were throwing 20+ people at a time many times a day into small open-air shacks to kill them with a delousing agent.

To many, these ideas are simply ridiculous and deserve to be questioned so that we can understand what happened and why.

Notice, for example, how all focus of Holocaust study and rhetoric is on the gas chambers and camp systems. That's all anybody cares about anymore. It's also the most flimsy of the whole picture.

Did the Nazis undertake an operation of the mass execution of Jews during WWII? Why, yes in fact they did. When the Germans were marching east into Russia during the final moments of the war they went town by town, took out the Jews and the Communist supporters, had them dig their own grave, and then shot them. This is incredibly well documented by all sides involved, with vast amounts of physical evidence that persisted. Why is it we never hear talk of this?

We are not allowed to approach the Holocaust from a neutral perspective. We are not allowed to dig and prod and reevaluate evidence or information. You MUST accept that six million Jews died. You MUST accept that the Nazis hated the Jews suddenly one day for no reason at all. You MUST accept that all white gentiles everywhere are guilty of the crimes you aren't allowed to question. You also must accept that the trillion dollar industry of war reparations must continue.

Meanwhile, over in the USSR and China, we are free to downplay all of their atrocities. Why is that? Why is National Socialism forbidden and evil, while Global Socialism is taught in universities and pushed by political committees both left and right as beautiful and good?

As an American I find this whole idea of forbidden thoughts and discussion to be pathetic and self-defacing. We should seek out the truth, whatever it may be. 

To tie that into modern day politik there is a hard effort from various parties to prevent acknowledgement of the source of the Chinese Coronavirus being a research lab in Wuhan. This is entirely for political reasons but is being pushed all the same into the ""untouchable"" territory. You're a racist if you say that China caused this to happen."

One is by triggering an abnormal immune response known as a cytokine storm that causes inflammation of the brain -- called autoimmune encephalitis.

The total number of confirmed COVID-19 cases in Wuhan as of April 16 was revised up by 325 to 50,333, and the number of fatalities up by 1,290 to 3,869, reports Xinhua news agency.

In a notification, the Wuhan municipal headquarters for the COVID-19 epidemic prevention and control said the revisions were made in accordance with related laws and regulations as well as the principle of being responsible for history, the people and the deceased.

Four reasons for the data discrepancies were listed in the notification:

A surging number of patients at the early stage of the epidemic overwhelmed medical resources and the admission capacity of medical institutions. Some patients died at home without having been treated in hospitals.

During the height of their treating efforts, hospitals were operating beyond their capacities and medical staff were preoccupied with saving and treating patients, resulting in belated, missed and mistaken reporting.

Due to a rapid increase of designated hospitals for treating COVID-19 patients, including those administered by ministries, Hubei province, Wuhan city and its districts, those affiliated to companies, as well as private hospitals and makeshift hospitals, a few medical institutions were not linked to the epidemic information network and failed to report their data in time.

The registered information of some of the deceased patients was incomplete, and there were repetitions and mistakes in the reporting.

An official of the headquarters told the media that a group for epidemic-related big data and epidemiological investigations was established in late March.

So on the one hand, I can sort of see why, out of the crowd that is resisting the lockdowns the ones here would especially *feel* like things are overblown... they're not seeing much of the virus where they are.

On the other hand, I was *also* surprised and interested to see that, while many other states are seeing their numbers start to level off, [Minnesota](https://www.health.state.mn.us/diseases/coronavirus/situation.html) is **still experiencing exponential growth** in their cases and deaths - they had a record number of deaths just today - it also looks like the state's stay-at-home order came ""only"" three weeks ago, a little later than some other.

Singapore’s new covid-19 cases reveal the country’s two very different realities

￼

By Kirsten Han 

April 16, 2020 at 11:25 AM EDT

Kirsten Han is a journalist and writer in Singapore.

Singapore’s government is often praised, domestically and internationally, for its planning and foresight — and, in the past few months, particularly for its response to the coronavirus pandemic. But recent developments have demonstrated that you can’t have foresight for things you refuse to see.

A sharp increase in covid-19 cases among the country’s migrant worker population has now forced the government to take drastic measures. On Thursday, Singapore saw its highest number of new cases thus far: 728, the vast majority of which were among migrant workers. Nine dormitories, housing more than 50,000 men, mostly from Bangladesh, India and China, have been declared “isolation areas.” On Tuesday, the government put all dormitories effectively on lockdown, meaning that about 300,000 workers now have restrictions on their movements within their complexes.

The government appears to have been blindsided by this turn of events. ""Unfortunately, we do not have the luxury of the benefit of hindsight,” Minister for National Development Lawrence Wong said in response to a question at a news conference on April 9. Wong is also the co-chair of a task force put together to lead Singapore’s covid-19 response.

He added: “The virus is moving so quickly. If I'd known, I would have done things differently. But no one can tell the next step.”

While one can appreciate the number of considerations that the task force has to grapple with, an outbreak of the coronavirus among migrant workers should not have come as such a shock. The country has nearly a million work permit holders, usually referring to low-wage workers such as domestic workers or manual laborers. Though domestic workers are required to live with their employers, those who work at construction sites, shipyards, petrochemical refineries, or even as cleaners in neighborhood estates, live in dormitories, often with about 12 to 20 people in a room. One of the earlier clusters of covid-19 was at a construction site.

Migrant labor rights groups have been warning for years that these cramped, crowded conditions were a recipe for disaster. Transient Workers Count Too (TWC2) and the local media reported an outbreak of chickenpox in 2008. The same organization pointed out in 2016 that migrant workers were in need of better housing to protect them from the spread of dengue and Zika. This March, before the outbreak of covid-19 among migrant workers really hit home, TWC2’s president wrote that the ""risk of a new cluster among this group remains undeniable.”

There is no way the government did not know of the conditions in which migrant workers live and the risks that they would face during a global pandemic. The reality that covid-19 so harshly reveals is that there has long been two Singapores: one for citizens, long-term residents and expatriates, and one for the low-wage migrant workers who provide the back-breaking labor upon which Singapore gleams.

While immigrants on work visas for white-collar jobs have rights to family reunification and paths to eventual long-term residency and citizenship, low-wage work permit holders have no such options. They aren’t even allowed to marry Singaporeans or permanent residents in Singapore without first seeking permission from the government.

This logic has even extended into virus containment measures. At the April 9 press conference, Wong said that it was “important to realize and recognize that we are dealing with two separate infections” — one rising among migrant workers, and a more stable situation among the rest of the population. A later update, shared by the minister on Facebook, separated migrant worker cases from imported and community cases. A separate task force has been convened specifically to look at migrant worker dormitories, with the military and police force roped in.

While returning Singaporeans and permanent residents serve isolation periods in the comfort of hotels, some even with laundry and personal shopping services, there is now a desperate hurry to find alternative solutions for the huge migrant worker population. Those confirmed to have the coronavirus have already been relocated, but the government is still facing an urgent need to reduce population density within dormitories.

Healthy workers performing “essential services” are being relocated to empty public housing flats, so they can continue cleaning and managing the facilities that Singaporeans need. Floating lodgings, military camps and even car parks at projects still under construction are also being put to use in the rush for different accommodation options.

The covid-19 response is stretching the ministries to the limit, and ministers have pleaded with the public for understanding. One sympathizes with the civil servants grappling with a mammoth task. But it shouldn’t be forgotten that the political leadership has not only neglected, but also enabled, the exploitation and discrimination of Singapore’s lowest-paid migrants.

The minister for manpower has pledged that living conditions in dormitories will be further addressed once this crucial period is over, while the prime minister himself has made a commitment to care for the well-being of these workers. These promises need to be kept. When people eventually return to their regular routines, Singapore cannot return to this exploitative model that pretends migrant workers aren’t really part of the local population, even as it profits off their labor."

America pulled the funding out of concern. I personally believe COVID-19 was building upon that research as an HIV/SARS-coronavirus chimera.

Now I don't know about all the biowarefare stuff. I can just say as a scientist myself, we are incredibly foolishly brave types who are cavalier about the risks of what we are working with. It becomes ""normal"" to casually toss around explosives when you work with them everyday.

\- People hesitant to be around other people  
\- People hesitant to spend what little money they've got on anything  
\- People now used to being on internet more and don't feel like going out anyways  
\- Small B&M businesses and sectors like retail, theaters/concert venues, etc. suffering as a result of all of this  
\- Some sectors like cruises probably taking much much longer to get back on their feet than anyone expects. Screw vaccine - unless there's actual reasonable treatment, I think people will be seeing cruises as coronavirus factories  
\- As time goes, the ""bounce back"" earnings reports end up being shit and that keeps things down even longer

Maybe it won't be SPY 220 or below again, but maybe back down around 240-250 when this stuff starts happening. I'm just not sure what sudden surprising turn of events could happen before this that would take the market down. But certainly states/govt telling people it's safe to go out and people being like ""nah son"" would have an effect."

FAQ

Q: Why is your data different than OP's?

A: I pull my data from the [Ohio Coronavirus website](https://coronavirus.ohio.gov/wps/portal/gov/covid-19/home/dashboard) via a spreadsheet they update daily. That gives different numbers than what OP posts. 

From my understanding, rather than just saying ""we have 400 new cases today"" they backdate some of the cases to the day they likely actually contracted the virus. So the total remains the same, but the daily amount changes. For example, on 4/7 the number of cases on 4/6 was 56. On 4/8 the number of cases on 4/6 went up to 137."

I think he is a very weak candidate. But also: coronavirus changes things. If the economy hasn't recovered and Donald Trump is presiding over a depression in which many people are continuing to lose loved ones to a horrendous disease that he is blamed for failing to mitigate, voters might be willing to vote for a potted plant over Donald Trump. Biden is as close to a potted plant as a living human can be, so he could conceivably win. If not for the virus, though, if Trump had still been presiding over a strong economy, I think Biden would have been doomed. Now everything is chaos and I'm going to try not to predict the future."

Also there’s a hit to the economy which decreases the marginal propensity to consume, further decreasing demand for goods and the supply of money (increased amount of saving). On the flip side, supply is increasing as inventory accumulated, which further diminishes the price of goods. This is called a deflationary spiral and often occurs in economic downturns. You can see this happening already with many retailers hosting large sales to offset coronavirus (lower prices = deflation) and a decrease in the consumer price index.

I know breakthroughs have been made, but vaccines for coronavirus strains can't go through the same rapid-pace rigorous testing that one-off (non-seasonal) flu vaccines go through.

Part of that is we (as a global whole) have a lot of experience making flu vaccines. So when a specialized one is needed (such as for H1N1), there is already a fairly speedy process to put that new vaccine through, since we know the common downfalls. 

With coronavirus strains, I know that at least in my lifetime, there have only been three major coronavirus strains that effect humans, and one of those basically never even hit the news here in Canada (MERS). Even SARS didn't affect as many people as severely in Canada as the flu does every year. 

That said, this coronavirus is obviously far more virulent, fatal, and overall concerning than SARS or MERS. 

We deal with creating flu vaccines every 6 months, globally. It's gonna take some time to create a viable vaccine for this specific strain of coronavirus. Fortunately, we will probably figure out ways to create new vaccines in a more rapid fashion from this, but, as of right now, a viable vaccine is still likely 1-1.5 years out."

Having identifiable coronavirus antibodies in your bloodstream means you've probably built up immunity. But roughly 6% of the patients studied didn't develop any detectable antibodies at all.”

“Interestingly, the levels of antibodies patients produced seemed to correlate with their ages: Middle-aged and elderly recovered patients had higher levels of antibodies. Nine of the 10 of the patients who did not develop detectable levels of coronavirus antibodies were 40 years old or younger.”

“In the 10 patients in the study who did not develop detectable antibodies, ""other immune responses, including T cells or cytokines, may contribute to the recovery,"" the researchers wrote.”

2020-04-17,Kader_surprise,france,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/france/comments/g38spa/ce_que_le_confinement_nous_apprend_de_léconomie/fnpu30v/,"Depuis quelques jours, une petite musique se fait entendre : il faut cesser de toute urgence le confinement pour des raisons économiques. Dans Les Échos, l’éditorialiste Éric Le Boucher le dit clairement : « Il faut sortir la France du confinement. » L’idée est défendue par plusieurs journalistes sur Twitter, dans les radios, à la télévision. L’idée est simple et s’appuie sur un des instruments préférés des économistes, le tableau coût-bénéfice.

D’un côté, les morts du coronavirus, de l’autre les coûts économiques de perte de PIB et de la crise qui suivra, qui induiront aussi des morts. Ce rapport serait favorable à la reprise de l’activité économique. On pourrait donc revenir à la fameuse stratégie de « l’immunité de groupe » et tolérer les morts du coronavirus pour ne pas avoir à en déplorer davantage pour cause de désastre économique.

La démarche est remarquable par ce qu’elle dit de ce qu’est l’économie capitaliste. Elle s’appuie sur un des éléments les plus puissants de ce système, mais aussi, lorsqu’il est mis à nu, un des plus fragiles : l’abstraction. Car dans cette macabre comptabilité, deux réalités distinctes sont mises à égalité. D’un côté celle d’un phénomène qui s’impose à l’homme, un virus contre lequel nous n’avons pas d’armes, du moins pour l’heure, et qui tue directement des hommes et des femmes. Et de l’autre, une création de l’humanité, l’économie de la marchandise, qui imposerait sa loi à sa créatrice au point de lui enlever également des vies.

**Il n’est pas question de nier que les crises économiques sont coûteuses en vies humaines. Les exemples du passé le montrent assez. Mais ce que ces doctes penseurs oublient, c’est que ces crises ne sont pas des phénomènes qui échappent aux hommes. Elles sont le produit de leur organisation sociale, de leur activité et de leurs choix. Et il ne dépend que d’eux de trouver d’autres formes d’organisation qui sauvent des vies et empêchent que les crises ne tuent autant.**

Autrement dit, ce que le discours de ces contempteurs économiques du confinement cache, c’est que les victimes de la crise ne seront pas les victimes collatérales du choix de préserver aujourd’hui des vies, elles ne seront pas les victimes tardives de notre décision de freiner la pandémie de coronavirus, elles seront les victimes de l’organisation économique fondée sur le fétichisme de la marchandise qui se traduit précisément dans leurs calculs de bas étage.

On comprend leur colère : soudain, en quelques semaines, on se rend compte que l’on peut stopper la fuite en avant de l’économie marchande, que l’on peut se concentrer sur l’essentiel : nourrir, soigner, prendre soin. Et que, étrangeté suprême, la Terre ne cesse pas de tourner, ni l’humanité d’exister. Le capitalisme est suspendu dans son fonctionnement le plus primaire : il génère une plus-value minimale, insuffisante à alimenter la circulation du capital. Et l’homme existe encore.

Mieux même, débarrassé de l’abstraction marchande, il pense à sa vie et à celle des autres. C’est un pan essentiel de la pensée de ces gens qui s’effondre : le capitalisme n’est pas l’humanité. Lorsque la marchandise cesse de créer la « richesse », il ne se passe rien ou presque. On établit une forme de « socialisme de la pandémie», pour reprendre les termes de l’ancien dirigeant de Citigroup Willem Buiter.

Alors, pour continuer à maintenir en vie le mythe du caractère capitaliste intrinsèque de l’humanité, on a recours à des menaces : tout cela se paiera, et au centuple. Et par des morts. On ne réduit pas impunément le PIB de 30 %. Sauf que, précisément, l’époque montre le contraire et invite à construire une organisation où, justement, la vie humaine, et non la production de marchandises, sera au centre.

Et là encore, l’époque est bavarde. Ces gens qui pensent que seul le marché produit de la valeur se retrouvent, eux-mêmes, à pouvoir manger à leur faim dans une ville propre, alors même que le marché ne fonctionne plus de façon autonome. Ils ne le peuvent que grâce au travail quotidien de salariés, des éboueurs aux caissières, des chauffeurs de bus aux soignants, des livreurs aux routiers qui, tout en s’exposant au virus, exposent au grand jour la preuve de l’écart béant entre la valorisation par le marché de leur travail abstrait et la valeur sociale de leur labeur concret. La valeur produite par le marché qui donne à un consultant un poids monétaire dix fois supérieur à celui d’une caissière ou d’un éboueur apparaît alors pour ce qu’elle est : une abstraction vide de sens. Ou plutôt une abstraction destinée à servir ce pourquoi elle est créée : le profit.

Pour nos « économistes », tout cela est profondément insupportable et il faut vite en finir avec un confinement qui finirait par rendre tout cela trop visible. On finirait par s’imaginer qu’il est possible de s’organiser autrement, de placer d’autres priorités au sein du fonctionnement social, de définir ses besoins essentiels pour construire une société de la sobriété. Mais alors, on n’aurait plus besoin de tout ce fatras – PIB, compétitivité, profits, dividendes, marchés financiers – qui assure la soumission du monde du travail à la valeur d’échange. On pourrait démocratiser l’économie…

C’est bien pourquoi il est urgent de passer à la suite, cette fameuse crise qu’on laissera se développer pour nous passer l’envie de recommencer à placer les vies concrètes au-dessus de l’abstraction marchande.

Mais ne nous faisons pas d’illusion : quelles que soient les gamberges qui, dans ce temps suspendu, nous occupent sur le « monde d’après », le confinement n’est en rien progressiste, encore moins « socialiste ». Et c’est précisément la difficulté de la situation.

Au début de la pandémie, les gouvernements les plus imprévoyants (notamment l’Italie, la France, l’Espagne, le Royaume-Uni et les États-Unis) ont choisi de faire le même calcul que ce que proposent Éric Le Boucher et ses amis : on ne pouvait sacrifier l’économie à une « mauvaise grippe ». On tablait donc sur l’immunité de groupe. Les gens mourraient certes en nombre, mais vite. L’impact économique serait réduit.

C’est ce choix qui a incité les autorités italiennes à tarder à agir en Lombardie, alors que, comme l’ont montré les enquêtes d’Il Fatto Quotidiano, le patronat local redoutait de perdre des marchés. Et c’est aussi ce choix qui explique, en France, le mensonge sur la pénurie de masques, tant la reconnaître publiquement aurait obligé à détrôner l’économie au profit de l’urgence sanitaire. Sans compter, dans le cas français toujours, les agendas idéologiques et politiciens du pouvoir – imposer à la hussarde la réforme des retraites, tenir coûte que coûte les municipales.

Si toutes ces autorités, y compris les plus convaincues, comme les gouvernements britannique ou étasunien, ont abandonné cette stratégie, c’est que, politiquement, face aux alertes répétées des soignants et des chercheurs, il n’était plus possible d’assumer ces décès massifs dans des hôpitaux surchargés. Et il était trop tard pour les éviter. Une telle image aurait été désastreuse et on aurait accusé le capitalisme de dévorer les vies pour son propre intérêt. À une époque où la question des inégalités et du changement climatique, et de leurs relations avec le modèle économique, se pose avec acuité, l’effet aurait été ravageur. On s’est donc résolus à momentanément « sacrifier » l’économie.

On s’y est d’ailleurs plus ou moins résolus. En France, toujours, on s’est échinés à maintenir une activité inutile pour « réduire l’impact », mais aussi et surtout pour continuer à maintenir au maximum le règne de l’économie. On se souvient des pressions exercées par la ministre du travail Muriel Pénicaud sur le secteur du BTP pour que les chantiers reprennent. Il ne faut jamais oublier que le confinement français, comme d’autres d’ailleurs, est un confinement limité où 40 % des travailleurs doivent continuer à justifier de leur présence, malgré les risques. Et il faut se souvenir que c’est encore une fois devant l’échec de cette stratégie du « en-même-temps » et l’accélération de la pandémie que des gouvernements, avec la même stratégie de départ, en Italie ou en Espagne, ont dû réduire au strict minimum l’activité économique.

Mais qu’on ne s’y trompe pas : ce n’est que partie remise. Plus cette crise « politiquement fabriquée » sera sévère, plus, là aussi, on la fera payer à la population. Pour « reconstruire », assurer les « emplois », attirer les investisseurs, bref, faire repartir la machine, on demandera, comme a commencé à le faire Bruno Le Maire, des « efforts » à la population. On fera donc tout pour que le confinement produise une violente crise économique qui, effectivement, sera cruelle et coûteuse en vies humaines. On le fera simplement : en se contentant de « geler » le système économique et en se gardant de profiter de cette suspension pour le modifier. Une fois décongelé, l’économie marchande donnera le pire d’elle-même. Ses mécanismes propres se déchaîneront. Mais on devra l’accepter comme une loi divine."

Deaths in hospital of patients with or suspected of having coronavirus have to have a ""covid notification of death"" form filled out and submitted to NHS England within an hour of death - that's where the daily counts are coming from. It can be days before a death is registered so what actually goes on the MCCD isn't being counted as part of the death toll. 

Covid is also a notifiable disease so all positive cases, regardless of mortality must be sent through to public health england which is where the ""diagnosis"" figures come from. 

This guidance just brings it into line with other diseases. We don't write the causative organism for other types of pneumonia - you'll record ""Bronchopneumonia"" as opposed to ""Klebsiella Bronchopneumonia"".

* **I want to bring your attention to a site which is presenting a lot of graphs more elegantly and effectively than some of my own crude attempts.

Please check it out here: https://advaithasabnis.github.io/covid19/ **
* There was a double-log incoming vs total cases graph, explained here https://www.reddit.com/r/CanadaCoronavirus/comments/fqxgi7/how_to_tell_if_were_beating_covid19/. I've retired my graph for this; it's better done elsewhere - e.g. in this graph you can see the provinces as they drop out of exponential growth: https://aatishb.com/covidtrends/?region=Canada&location=Alberta&location=British+Columbia&location=Manitoba&location=New+Brunswick&location=Newfoundland+and+Labrador&location=Nova+Scotia&location=Ontario&location=Quebec&location=Saskatchewan 
* Here are some other graphs I'm playing with (MultiTrends): https://imgur.com/a/caRxVWu

* Canadian data from virihealth.com (from PHAC & provinces), USA data from coronavirus.1point3acres.com, Other national data was from WHO sitreps.
* I am not an epidemiologist. I'm not a government employee. I don't even play a doctor on TV. I just like numbers.

This data is admittedly imperfect: testing is incomplete, there is a test backlog, and reporting is not completely fluid.  This is too simplistic a model for realistic projection, given all of the unknowns and variables of such a complex system.  That said, I'll continue to track this, to see where it goes.

Today's data notes:  

* I was informed that QC's deaths yesterday jumped partially due to reclassifying probables with their official number. QC and ON continue to climb steadily, and Alberta's positives are accelerating in the past week. On a happy note, we now have over 10K recovered. NB, PEI (and dare I say, MB?) had no new cases today.
* Nationally, 2121 are hospitalized (+93 from yesterday, and a new high), and 533 are in ICU (-8 from yesterday; the high water mark was 575 on Apr 13). As these numbers climb, the burden on our healthcare workers will increase. Godspeed and thanks to them as they stand on guard for thee and me. 
* Canada's death toll today was 115, bringing the cumulative total deaths to 1310: 58 in QC, 55 in ON, 1 each in NS & BC.  4.1% of known positives are deceased. This is higher than average, but we've had a lot of senior care homes hit. Also, this is not really the mortality rate, since that won't be known until all those infected are recovered or not, and may vary significantly if the healthcare system is overwhelmed.
* People tested (+20,073) = 515,900 (1.37% of the population). Testing up from over 18.6K yesterday. Nice to see it back up >20K. 
* Tested positive (+1820) = **31,926** (6.19% of those tested). The cumulative hit rate climbs slightly from 6.08% yesterday, rising 24 days in a row. The higher hit rate is concerning, particularly in QC(10.9% overall, 18.27% today) and ON (7.3% overall, 7.8% today). 
* Test backlog - 8133 today, up from 7639 yesterday. 
* Recovered (+814) = 10,560 (33.08% of known positives). MB joins the happy side of 50% recovered, joining PEI, SK, NB, NL and BC are above 50% recovered. AB was briefly above 50% on Apr12 but has regressed below after an increase in cases. Now AB are chasing ON to the 50% line. QC and NS are way behind on this score.
* Known active = 20,073 (Total positives - recovered - deceased). First time this has exceeded 20K but it could start going down in the next week or two, if things go well. The unknowns are unknown. 
* The bump in China's number @ day 29 was due to a change in the way their cases were categorized.
* The growth rate appears in cases seems to be slowing. Higher doubling time is better. March16 - doubling rate= every 2.84 days; March23=2.74 days; Mar30=4.21 days; Apr6=8.19 days. My latest week-averaged doubling rate: Apr13=11.7 days.
* World notes: Global cases exceeded 2 Million, today, half being from Europe. USA passes 700K cases, half their 32K (confirmed) deaths are NY/NJ/CT, but there are 5 other states with over 1K deaths. Russia adds 4K more cases to 32K, passing Canada and Holland today. UK cases surpassed 100K.  After months of containment, Japan and Singapore cases are climbing again (585 and 728).

“Antibody tests have captured the world’s attention for their potential to help life return to normal by revealing who has been exposed, and might now be immune, to the new coronavirus...

But as with most new technologies, there are signs that the promises of COVID-19 antibody tests have been oversold, and their challenges underestimated...

Antibody tests are also being used by researchers globally to estimate the extent of coronavirus infections at a population level ...

Kits need to be trialled on large groups of people to verify their accuracy: hundreds of people who have had COVID-19, and hundreds of people who haven't, says Peter Collignon, a physician and laboratory microbiologist at Australian National University in Canberra. But so far, most test assessments have involved only some tens of individuals because they have been developed quickly...

A high-quality test should achieve 99% or more sensitivity and specificity, adds Collignon. That means that testing should turn up only about 1 false positive and 1 false negative for every 100 true positive and true negative results.

But some commercial antibody tests have recorded specificities as low as 40% early in the infection. In an analysis1 of 9 commercial tests available in Denmark, 3 lab-based tests had sensitivities ranging 67–93% and specificities of 93–100%. In the same study, five out of six point-of-care tests had sensitivities ranging 80–93%, and 80-100% specificity, but some kits were tested on fewer than 30 people. Testing was suspended for one kit. Overall, the sensitivity of all the tests improved over time, with the highest sensitivity recorded two weeks after symptoms first appeared.”"

Speaking at the midweek coronavirus briefing, Mayor Steve Freel of Casper, Wyo., said he might sound a little frustrated.
He had just watched a Facebook video of a party that took place over the weekend showing partygoers “flat-out thumbing their noses” at public health guidelines, he said. And what’s worse: The party was attended by a health-care worker with a pending coronavirus test, as the Casper Star-Tribune earlier reported.
The health-care worker’s roommate, an employee at the Wyoming Behavioral Institute — home to one of the largest clusters of cases in Wyoming — had tested positive for the virus last Friday. So, because of evident exposure, the unidentified health-care worker then sought a covid-19 test on that same day.

But despite a self-quarantine recommendation, the worker decided to go to a party on Friday night, Freel said. On Saturday, the worker went to another party.

And finally, on Monday, Freel said the health-care worker got the test results back: positive for coronavirus.
Public health officials were left scrambling to locate all the partygoers to get them in isolation as quickly as possible, Freel said. He did not say how many attendees were exposed, or if they have been tested yet, but rebuked the worker and all of the party attendees for putting the community at risk.
Sign up for our Coronavirus Updates newsletter to track the outbreak. All stories linked in the newsletter are free to access.
“We’ve been preaching this for the last how many weeks now, that you have got to take this seriously,” Freel said at the Wednesday news conference. “And for people who say it’s not a serious thing, ask the people who just attended that party and tell me how serious it is now.”


The situation is an example of the difficulties some Wyoming officials are having enforcing social distancing guidelines in a state with the lowest amount of confirmed coronavirus cases in the nation — just under 300 as of early Friday. Wyoming, the country’s least populated state, became the last to report a coronavirus death, with its first on Monday and its second on Wednesday. Like in several other states, a group of protesters showed up at the state capitol building Wednesday to demand that Gov. Mark Gordon (R) release a plan to reopen the economy, believing the covid-19 curve had been sufficiently flattened, as the Wyoming Tribune Eagle reported.
AD

But Gordon said this week that it was too soon to lift restrictions. Since Wyoming was late to the outbreak compared to other states, he said, it will probably be late to its peak, too.
“If we ease up and fail to adhere to the guidance currently in place, if we think that this will turn off like a switch, we may not be ready to relax any restrictions,” he said. “If anyone thinks that simply easing restrictions currently in place will lead to an immediate return to normal, they need to think again.""

The spread of the novel coronavirus in Wyoming has been slow, making the state vulnerable to vacationers trying to escape the virus. Rich people with private jets have been flying into Jackson Hole, located in the valley of two majestic mountain ranges near the Idaho border, to hide away as the virus takes its course, the New York Times recently reported. Law enforcement in Johnson and Park counties told the Tribune Eagle that they had been noticing an unusual amount of out-of-state traffic that typically doesn’t show itself this time of year.
AD

“There’s definitely nonresident traffic that we’ve not had before, not this time of year,” Johnson County Sheriff Rod Odenbach told the paper, which called the crowd “coronavirus refugees.” “You’re used to seeing those people, but not in April. The snow’s not even off the mountain yet.”
In Natrona County, Mark Dowell, the county’s health officer, said Wednesday that the low number of statewide and county cases is likely deceiving, warning that it may be “easy to think it’s not that big a deal when it hasn’t destroyed your community.” But signs of community transmission are growing, as officials monitor at least three large clusters of coronavirus cases statewide.

“We have not flattened any curve at all,” Dowell said.
One cluster is linked to the Wyoming Behavioral Institute — where the health-care worker’s roommate was employed. Of the 37 cases in Natrona County, at least 22 are linked to the psychiatric hospital, a caseload that now includes staff, patients and residents not affiliated with the hospital, the Star-Tribune reported.
AD

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention visited the hospital this week as part of its efforts to help Wyoming keep its caseload down low, the paper reported, citing a news release from Mike Phillips, the hospital’s CEO.
Phillips said the CDC reviewed and approved the steps the hospital has taken to stop the spread of the virus. New patients are quarantined for 72 hours, and all are screened for symptoms twice a day, along with anyone entering the building. The hospital stopped allowing visitors in mid-March.

Dowell applauded the hospital’s efforts on Wednesday during his briefing, saying they were doing a good job “containing a problem that is not their fault but is very tricky.”
Freel said he hoped people who still weren’t taking the pandemic seriously in the area would look at the WBI outbreak and see what happened when just one person decided to ignore social distancing guidelines.
AD

“Ninety percent of the people out there, you’re doing what needs to be done,” Freel said. “To the people that aren’t, [to the people] on the Facebook video I saw today, hopefully they change the way that they think.”"

* While it is true that travel bans for China and Iran went into effect at the very end of January, the US did not close its borders to the rest until mid- to late-March.  Given that the vast majority of countries were still open for travel, it's not even close to being as improbable as he believes.
* He assumes that the only reason someone would leave would be to save money.  Perhaps they had to return to take care of elderly parents?  Or some other obligation that required them to return (i.e., visa requirements)?
* Some people do have unreliable internet, particularly overseas.  I see it every day when I meet with my team at work via Microsoft Teams.
* Some freshmen ARE of an age to be supporting children.  I myself went back to school at 34, and while I don't have kids, it's not outside the realm of possibility for me to have them in the slightest.  There are also some very young parents out there who may have had kids in high school and are trying to balance parenthood with their education.
* Sure, coronavirus poses a low (but not insignificant) risk to otherwise-healthy young adults.  It still poses a risk to those with underlying medical conditions (asthma, cystic fibrosis, obesity, hypertension, etc.)  And not everyone's parents are in their 40s-50s--some are older.  Even assuming that his assumptions are true, there also seems to be a genetic component to how hard the virus hits, as well. 

Sure, he's entitled to his opinion, but his opinion, at least in my own opinion, is pretty ill-informed."

ironically for men it doesn’t matter. if the guy makes money that’s the marker of success. looks are secondary. but also in my culture there’s very few ow men in general. i’m not sure why but the obesity rate is really low. i assume its cause men have a lot of pressure to work so they’re usually too stressed and busy to eat. usually the consensus is that women cook so if there’s a girlfriend or wife it’s all home cooked meals. 

our food is very simple, no extensive sauces or spices. so like it’s very bland but it’s also all whole foods, even canned stuff is like fish or marinated vegetables. our junk food is made with different ingredients, significantly less salt and flavoring cause a lot of additives are banned and there’s practically no imports. when i moved to north america i was blown away by the food here. it’s addicting af and so tasty. like even our tomatoes don’t taste the same. tomatoes here taste like morsels of heaven, i could eat them all day. back home they don’t taste that great - like they’re okay but meh whatever. like we don’t have that much variety. like you can’t go to the store and find 50 varieties of cereal, we don’t even eat cereal back home. it’s just not a thing to give kids sugar in the morning. like we eat a regular meal like lunch or dinner in the morning, with protein. 

it’s also why it’s difficult to get ow back home, cause we eat a lot of meat but it’s not made the same way. like there’s no deep frying. i didn’t even know this until recently but when we say frying we actually mean sautéing (woohoo new words). most things are baked, broiled, bbq-ed or put on an open fire. and a lot of it is game or big animals rather than poultry. like deep fried chicken only became a thing recently with mcdonald’s showing up. but lol even the mcdonald’s doesn’t have the same menu as in america and the portion sizes are so much smaller - even for burgers. 

i’m so nostalgic writing this, i really miss home. every time i go back i like instantly lose 7kg without even trying. i don’t even change anything about my eating either. i don’t restrict when i go home. i eat everything, including ice cream and stuff i would never eat while i’m here. and i still lose weight. i really do believe that it has to do with how food is grown and the culture, what ingredients are allowed in processed foods etc. cause the milk here doesn’t even taste good compared to the milk back home. it’s rich and delicious and can substitute a meal, meanwhile milk here is like some watered down shit. i don’t even drink it. 

ahhh i wanna go home to visit family. stupid coronavirus."

They were very careful to clip out the sensational part, when the full motion is the complete opposite of the headline here. Here is the first paragraph of the motion that they pulled their hacked up quote from (emphasis mine).

>Plaintiff WASHLITE seeks a judicial gag order against Fox News for airing **supposedly ""deceptive""** commentary about the Coronavirus outbreak and our nation's response to it. But the only deception here is in the Complaint. Fox's opinion hosts have never described the Coronavirus as a ""hoax"" or a ""conspiracy,"" but instead used those terms to comment on efforts to exploit the pandemic for political points. Regardless, the claims here are frivolous because the statements at issue are core political speech on matters of public concern. The First Amendment does not permit censoring this type of speech based on the **theory** that it is ""false or ""outrageous."" Nor does the law of the State of Washington. The complaint therefore should be dismissed as a matter of law.

„In recent weeks, most of the Eastern European nurses who worked 24 hours a day, 7 days a week supporting people in need of care in Italy have left the country in a hurry. This is not least because of the panic-mongering and the curfews and border closures threatened by the „emergency governments“. As a result, old people in need of care and disabled people, some without relatives, were left helpless by their carers.

Many of these abandoned people then ended up after a few days in the hospitals, which had been permanently overloaded for years, because they were dehydrated, among other things. Unfortunately, the hospitals lacked the personnel who had to look after the children locked up in their apartments because schools and kindergartens had been closed. This then led to the complete collapse of the care for the disabled and the elderly, especially in those areas where even harder „measures“ were ordered, and to chaotic conditions.

The nursing emergency, which was caused by the panic, temporarily led to many deaths among those in need of care and increasingly among younger patients in the hospitals. These fatalities then served to cause even more panic among those in charge and the media, who reported, for example, „another 475 fatalities“, „The dead are being removed from hospitals by the army“, accompanied by pictures of coffins and army trucks lined up.

However, this was the result of the funeral directors‘ fear of the „killer virus“, who therefore refused their services. Moreover, on the one hand there were too many deaths at once and on the other hand the government passed a law that the corpses carrying the coronavirus had to be cremated. In Catholic Italy, few cremations had been carried out in the past. Therefore there were only a few small crematoria, which very quickly reached their limits. Therefore the deceased had to be laid out in different churches.

In principle, this development is the same in all countries. However, the quality of the health system has a considerable influence on the effects. Therefore, there are fewer problems in Germany, Austria or Switzerland than in Italy, Spain or the USA. However, as can be seen in the official figures, there is no significant increase in the mortality rate. Just a small mountain that came from this tragedy.“"

A small subset of COVID-19 patients have exhibited neurological problems and brain impairments, including strokes, seizures or generalized confusion. [Cases reported in the New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/01/health/coronavirus-stroke-seizures-confusion.html) include a 74-year-old man in Boca Raton, Fla., who lost the ability to speak and appeared to be suffering a seizure, flailing his arms and legs. An airline worker in her late 50s in Detroit complained of headaches and became less responsive — brain scans showed abnormal swelling in the brain, and areas where brain cells had died. Doctors diagnosed acute necrotizing encephalopathy, a rare complication of influenza and other viral infections. The pattern was consistent with a viral inflammation of the brain.

“This may indicate the virus can invade the brain directly in rare circumstances,” Dr. Elissa Fory told the Times. Doctors globally have reported patients who come in appearing dazed or confused. Experts emphasized most COVID-19 patients appear normal neurologically, and it’s too early to establish a definite link to neurological impairment. Low oxygen levels and increased carbon dioxide caused by the disease can also have an impact on brain functioning and lead to confusion and lethargy."

There’s a time and place for blockchain-bashing, and now is probably not the time (though Alphaville is, of course, the *only* place). Frankly, there are more important and concerning things to write about at the moment. 

But sometimes, when a spot of writer’s block just happens to coincide with the delivery of the most perfect exemplar of a techno-solutionist press release, well one’s appetite for blockchain-bashing is re-whetted. 

Shimmying on into our inbox on Wednesday came the news that “Tech rivals collaborate on blockchain to combat COVID-19”! This of course wasn’t the first release we’d been sent on how the distributed technicolour dream-ledger could help combat this deadly pandemic. And nor, we concede with some regret, will it be the last. 

But what it was, by a country mile, was the best (emphasis ours):

>In response to COVID-19, technology companies have ramped up collaborations on innovative technologies such as blockchain, says GlobalData, a leading data and analytics company.  
Charlotte Dunlap, Principal Analyst at GlobalData, comments: **“The industry can no longer afford to wait several years for new market segments such as blockchain to take off.”** 

Why is that, we hear you ask?

Well it’s simple. And reader, please do take your time to really savour this paragraph, because honestly even if we were trying to write parody we couldn’t have come up with this:

>The dire nature of COVID-19 demands the ability to fast-track solutions at a Netflix-like pace. **With the forthcoming enabling technologies, reducing complexity and the need for technical expertise in order to usher in a broader set of stakeholders, ‘citizen solver’ could become the newest catchphrase.**

There’s then some fluff about a “potentially mega-blockchain initiative” to “integrate COVID-19 data” from relentless [blockchain-pushers IBM](https://ftalphaville.ft.com/2019/01/10/1547127900000/Occam-s-blockchain-shaver/) and Oracle (who were actually [already working together](https://www.coindesk.com/old-rivals-oracle-and-ibm-want-their-blockchains-to-talk-to-each-other) on blockchain projects, so coronavirus does not appear to be, contrary to what the release is claiming, the impetus for this). We’re never told what on earth this integrated data will do, of course. We’re also given a couple of examples of “blockchain-based monitoring systems springing up”. Again, no explanation for why in Ford’s name the blockchain could possibly be of any benefit. 

And then the conclusion: 

>Dunlap concludes: **“The effects of unprecedented cooperation among technology rivals coming together to solve a global crisis will continue to linger long after the coronavirus is under control.** Enterprises should become accustomed to new levels of industry collaboration. This expectation will be based on a critical need for industry giants to rally together to focus attention in 2021 and beyond on helping to get the economy back on track and **ensuring customers are successful.”**

(Please God, please, can the customers be successful.)

You can read through this survey conducted by the [IGM Forum and University of Chicago](http://www.igmchicago.org/surveys/policy-for-the-covid-19-crisis/). Support for Question A

> A comprehensive policy response to the coronavirus will involve tolerating a very large contraction in economic activity until the spread of infections has dropped significantly

Is unanimous, but for the 3% of respondents who were “uncertain.” No economists disagreed with this statement.

Support for Question B

> Abandoning severe lockdowns at a time when the likelihood of a resurgence in infections remains high will lead to greater total economic damage than sustaining the lockdowns to eliminate the resurgence risk

Is also unanimous, but with a higher uncertain rate (14%) than question A.

Then, he saw an opportunity to gain PR and promised to donate ventilators to hospitals.

1.	He didn’t even donate ventilators, he donated BIPAP machines (which hospitals still accepted, but which cannot be used to help corona patients)
2.	Most of the machines have not even been delivered to hospitals. The governor of California himself confirmed that no machines have been received by hospitals. Someone else in this thread posted a source saying that he refused to send them to multiple hospitals because they would not do a photoshoot with Musk and doctors/nurses.
3.	The machines he donated have the Tesla logo plastered on them and as I mentioned before he wouldnt even give them to hospitals if it didn’t boost his public appearance. This was pretty tacky IMO, shows once again hes only doing this for his PR

Now yes, the long incubation period does complicate things in this regard but it still stands that milder symptoms tend to be spread easier so most viruses tend towards less severe.

Of course we don’t want to count on things going that way, you never want to assume the best case scenario when preparing for something so dangerous, we ought to prepare for the possibility of it going that way, but if it helps you sleep at night, mutating to a more deadly strain is less likely than mutating to a milder strain, that’s why it’s so notable that the Spanish Flu played out the way it did, but do understand that that was the exception more than the norm.

You want to be ready for the worst, of course, but do understand that mutating into a more deadly strain isn’t the most likely scenario"

**Highlights**

The primary concern is triggering avalanches in freshly wind-drifted snow. The Northern Mountains picked up some decent snowfall over the last couple days, and more is on the way for Wednesday. Winds are strong enough to drift this snow into stiffer slabs up to 2 feet thick in areas that picked up more than foot of recent storm snow. The most dangerous slopes are at higher elevations, steeper than about 35 degrees, and face north and east. Look for signs of recent wind loading like smooth rounded pillows, and slopes below fresh cornice formation. Cracking in the new snow is a clear sign of slab formation.  

You can find safer riding options in wind-sheltered and below treeline areas.

**Weather Discussion**

Tuesday night is cold with some light snowfall, favoring the Northern Mountains. Increasing moisture arrives with good jet support on Wednesday. This will generate moderate snowfall for the Park Range and northern Continental Divide areas with quickly diminishing totals as you move further south. Temperatures warm about 5 to 10 degrees compared to Tuesday. The jet and low-pressure trough remain somewhat stagnant Wednesday night, and another pulse of moisture will generate additional snowfall favoring the Central and Northern Mountains with an additional 2 to 6 inches of accumulation. 

We are issuing morning and afternoon [Zone Weather Forecasts](https://avalanche.state.co.us/forecasts/weather/zone-forecast/). You can check current conditions on the [Weather Stations page](https://avalanche.state.co.us/observations/weather-stations/).

**Snowpack and Avalanche Discussion**

The last shot of snow dropped some healthy totals in portions of the Northern Mountains. Areas near Hoosier Pass, Berthoud Pass, the Ten Mile Range, and over to the Vail area picked up between 1 and 2 feet of snow. This snow was drifting into slabs on lee terrain features on Tuesday. With more snow and wind forecast for Wednesday, the threat of triggering a wind-drifted slab will stay with us the next couple days. 

Conditions are most dangerous on east-facing slopes with predominately westerly winds. But don't let your guard down on other aspects. Look for signs of wind loading below ridgelines, cornice features, and in cross-loaded gullies. Smooth round pillow, stiff snow surfaces, and/or cracking in the drifted storm snow are all signs of fresh slab formation. Consider the consequences of even a small avalanche in the drifted snow should you get knocked off your feet and taken for a ride. A two foot deep avalanche is large enough to bury you.

In wind sheltered and areas that received less snow conditions are generally safe. Do not commit to riding in steep confined areas without assessing if there are wind slabs lower down on the slope. It is easy to get 25 to 50 feet below the ridgeline and trigger a slide. 

Temperatures remain unseasonably cold for most of the week, but when the clouds break and the sun pops out the snow surface will warm up quickly. Southerly-facing slopes will be the most dangerous spots and it won't be surprising to see the surface snow sheet off on very steep southerly-facing aspects.

We don't have many observations from the Northern Mountains over the last few days, so if you are out please [submit an observation](https://avalanche.state.co.us/observations/submit-a-report/).

Ongoing bleeding, weight loss and suspected cancer is a big red flag and you should definitely be a priority right now, despite coronavirus. Don’t give up. Make sure you mention you have a family history of bowel cancer, it will be important in them triaging you. There are still doctors working from home - I live with one - and they will do their best to triage and make sure you can get the colonoscopy. Your GP is your best chance at getting you reconsidered as they can refer you to the specialists."
2020-04-17,baby_o,norge,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/norge/comments/g348ez/sikkerhetsbevisste_nordmenn_akkurat_nå/fnqh34u/,"Det virker å bli glemt at man til enhver tid har muligheten til å skru av sporing eller slette appen - og det faktum at det er frivillig å installere den på din mobil. Det er også en forutsetning for hele appen at den kun skal være mulig å bruke/installere så lenge Coronavirus/Covid-19 er en trussel for folkehelsen. 

Ja, jeg er enig i at det ikke er bra at staten ikke vil publisere kildekoden. Jeg har vanskelig for å forstå hvorfor de ikke publiserer den, men synes likevell at appen har livets rett all den tid folk tør å bruke den. 

Men å kalle det «ekstrem sporing» når du kan legge igjen mobiltelefonen der du vil, slette appen, skru av sporing etc. Er i beste fall en sannhet med store modifikasjoner. 

Norge er ikke Kina per i dag, og har ikke i nærheten av samme grad av statlig overvåkning som en ser i flere andre land, deriblant Storbritannia, Spania, Tyskland m.fl. 

Det er lite som tyder på at vi beveger oss i den retning også, og godt er det! 

Misforstå meg rett, det er veldig bra at folk er årvåkne og ikke tar alt for god fisk. 

Og det må være sagt, jeg kommer ikke til å installere appen selv, men synes det kan være et godt verktøy for den eller de som føler for å ofre litt mer av sin private data og/eller ønsker å få beskjed om de har vært farlig nær noen andre med appen som er smittet. Har også en følelse av at det er et godt alternativ til andre lignende tjenester som aktører med mindre hederlige hensikter. 

Dessverre tror ikke jeg denne appen vil ha noen effekt i en befolkning der en grei andel benytter iPhone (hvor appen er nærmest ubrukelig), der det ser ut til at majoriteten ikke vil bruke appen og de som blir smittet selv kan velge å ikke bruke appen. Så en kan gjerne ta i og skyte småspurv med kanon, men jeg mener der finnes bedre ting å bruke energien sin på. 

Ta en runde i dagligvarebutikken for din lokale frivilligsentral eller spør en i risikogruppen om de trenger noe!"

Infertility and birth defects have been side effects of other viruses, so it is not unreasonable to ask whether it is also a side effect of SARS-Cov-2 infections.  And even without infertility, there is a picture emerging of long-term health effects such as lung scarring, even in asymptomatic patients.

Short version: 

* The Chinese state media has been suggesting that the coronavirus didn't actually start in Wuhan 
* Rumors begin to grow, which are seemingly endorsed by the Chinese government, that the virus may have been brought to China via the US Military during military games in Wuhan
* Chinese state media increasingly report on COVID cases being imported via ""foreigners"" which includes everyone from Chinese who'd been traveling but are returning home, to actual foreigners. 
* Conspiracy theories grow, and increasingly anyone who is viewed ""foreign"" is now considered dangerous/the source of COVID/etc. 
* Blacks are lumped in with this and receive the brunt of it:

>In southern China, where there’s a large African community, a large number of Africans are evicted from their homes out of fear. And hotels won’t have them, so they’re sleeping on the streets. African diplomats are trying to deal with this, but they’re shouted down. McDonald’s and other restaurants won’t let black people in. The United States issues an actual diplomatic warning to African-Americans, saying, avoid this area because of the xenophobia and racism. And so you just see this sort of snowballing effect of this fear growing and growing. All of the fear of the foreigners related to the virus starts to tie into nationalism and a national self-image, all of which has been carefully cultivated by the Chinese Communist Party and the Chinese government."

If yes, then follow that spark of desire and see where it wants to land, there is a lot to learn from that. If no, then get curious. Why might that be? See if you can locate within yourself your own erotic landscape. Sometimes it is open to us, and sometimes it gets shut down for reasons that are not always readily available. Our conscious mind can be so distracted or in denial sometimes, but the body never lies. Honor the information it is giving you and see if what you can find out. 

For myself, this whole coronavirus thing has been a buzz kill. Crisis mode and constant togetherness (plus constant kids and a puppy in the house!) doesn’t exactly do great things for my libido. Sex is great when you have electricity inside that wants to jump to someone else’s body, and for a minute (or hopefully more, haha) you’re grounded to and through each other. It’s this incredibly social act. But the electricity has to be generated from within first, and you have to want to make a connection. It’s OKAY to not want to sometimes. It’s okay to not always have access to that zappy sparkly power. Trust that it’s there. Ask for what it needs. And let it rest if it wants to. 

I’ve been with my person for going on sixteen years, and I’ve come to realize that seasons of hot sex come and go and then come again, and most of the time I’m in an off season it has more to do with me actively turning myself “off” for reasons that are always obscure at first and always important to attune to. 

So yes. Go locate your desire if you can. It holds the answer to your question. 

All the best!"

I read somewhere else, and it bugs me I don’t have the specific source on hand, that vaccine development can be rather quick, but the big issue is testing to make sure it’s safe. This is typically why it takes SO LONG for any typical vaccine. There are already multiple vaccines being tested at the moment and have to go through the typical phases of clinical trials. Assuming any of those work comes mass production and immunity may come into question after some time. 

So I don’t disagree with you about it being longer than 18 months, my “17 months” figure came off the original hopeful numbers given."

So... they were fake Democrats? I'm not following your logic here. If he wasn't calling the vrus a hoax, what else was he calling a hoax?

>Do you not comprehend simple English

The irony. But seriously, the dems were asking him to take action or take it seriously, and that is ""politicizing"" it? As far as the English language goes the word hoax is defined as:

>a humorous or malicious deception.

**So in the context of the virus, a world leader on stage, at a rally, in front of a crowd used the word hoax, 2 months into a global pandemic**. 

No matter how you slice it, that shit looks terrible.

If he wasn't calling the virus a hoax, then the dems were, what? Deceptively ""politicizing it"" by asking him to take it seriously (when he very clearly wasn't)? Your ""logic"" falls apart. 

And even your nonsensical alternative looks terrible. Bottom line, there are ~35,000 dead Americans and ~20 million unemployed thanks to that dipshit. So much winning, ""MAGA""."

The proximity of a P4 coronavirus facility within about a kilometer from the wet market is of course quite suspicious.  We know that these labs capture bats and other exotic animals to isolate coronavirus for study.  I do not subscribe to the idea that this was engineered or let loose deliberately by China.  Why would they set it off in their own country? 

If the virus did originate from the lab and not the market, it was probably by poor control of the lab.  There were previous incidents where animal handlers got contaminated with feces or bit.  There are rumors that the handlers would even sell the exotic animals to the markets after working with the animals.  So either a worker got it in the lab or more speculatively a pangolin could have been sold after use in the lab.  You may be able to search this reddit for threads and links to articles.  The other possibility of course is that it came from the wet market.  They need to be stopped from selling exotic animals."

The problems: Customers get way too close to each other in the aisles (this is a problem that many stores around the country are having though), their staff outside the store watching the line to get into the store were NOT wearing any masks (but they were wearing gloves and were using hand sanitizer). Some of their cashiers wore masks and gloves but some of them were not wearing gloves or masks at all.

The good things they are doing: They make you wait in a line outside to get into the store, they make sure you keep a 6 feet distance while you are in the line to get into the store, they have plastic barriers installed at the checkout that keeps you separated from the cashier, they make sure customers keep a 6 feet distance while waiting in line for the pharmacy. And the last one, they have three people wearing masks directing customers in the line to checkout to different checkouts to make sure people don't get too close when they are checking out. Sometimes, they even wiped the trolley handles when I came into the store. They have limits on key supplies like toilet paper. All pharmacy members were wearing masks and gloves.

I feel like with how busy this place is, all of their cashiers and staff need to be wearing masks and gloves, along with continuing to use hand sanitizer.

I'm not really worried about having a brand or followers. I love art, and I feel like just being able to express myself artistically would be a huge relief for me. I don't have any hopes of doing it professionally. I just love art and am very inspired by drag. But I have exactly the worries you said you had in the beginning: I'm afraid of being rejected. And I'm even more afraid of offending people or giving the impression that I'm trying to appropriate the culture.

I was actually familiar with Hugo Grrl and Adam All's work, and I absolutely love what they do. That said, they do represent what I think most people conventionally understand as drag, and my style is extremely different from theirs. :( They are incredibly talented and their performances are visibly masculine, so I think no one in their right mind could reject them or question their place in the drag community. My style on the other hand... Lol.

I like weird clothes. I like toys and action figures and things that are a little out of reality. I would love to explore the idea of performing with puppets, toys, or animated characters (I LOVE stuff like this: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjPqV8GXVQU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjPqV8GXVQU) ). I'm autistic and have pretty severe OCD, so I would love to explore ways to turn all the weird shit that goes in my mind onto something interesting/entertaining to others. Lol. I'd love to create something weird and fucked up (kind of like Don't Hug Me I'm Scared. Here's a link if you're not familiar:  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C\_HReR\_McQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C_HReR_McQ)) but that can be performed live. Btw, I absolutely love that you were brave enough to join a competition! I'm so sorry that the coronavirus situation messed up your plans. But things will go back to normal soon. What were you planning to perform? What style inspires your drag the most? When you do perform, you have to post a video here so we can see!! I followed your Reddit page in case you decide to post your performance, so I don't miss it. :)

I don't think I could ever perform. I just don't see myself having the courage. I'm having an incredibly difficult time creating a drag persona that fits with at least some of my style because these weird ideas that make up my style are actually very representative of who really I am, while my sciency day job feels more like a costume. Lol. Living with autism I had to create a persona in order to be able to interact with people around me. The way I see myself doing drag would allow me to be myself for a little bit, which would make me feel a little less frustrated when I have to get up on Monday morning put on the ""normal person"" costume again before getting on with my day. I waste my time sketching costumes (I say it's a waste of time for me particularly because Idk how to sew, so it's not like I could ever make the outfits. Lol) and I find myself always drawn to saying weird things about myself through these outfits. I always find myself drawing super crazy gloves (as it is difficult for me to touch stuff without feeling like I have to wash my hands afterward), or outfits with stuff that speaks to my OCD. I sent a friend of mine a sketch I did of myself dressed in a costume with a doorknob as a nose because we had been talking about the time when I was 2 hours late for work because I could not get through the ritual I need to do when crossing the doorway of my house. So I told my friend that I designed the costume to try to get a job as a door so I wouldn't have to feel bad about getting stuck in the doorway anymore. Lmao.

In any case, thank you so much for the advice, it is super helpful. I just found Andro Gin (thanks to your reply) and I'm mesmerized. Thank you so much for the suggestion!"

What Bernie Sanders accomplished electorally was remarkable, revealing both how far a progressive can venture and the limits proscribing further advancement to the left within the Democratic Party.

>That Sanders was once the frontrunner and might have swept the Democratic primaries is an indicator of the neoliberal order’s decay. The coronavirus pandemic was both the final blow to the Sanders campaign and the world-historic event that proved unquestionably that his platform of universal health care and fairness to the working class was the medicine needed for an ailing nation.

snip

>The lie that money was not available to fund single-payer healthcare is now exposed by tsunamis of cash mainlined tax-free to resuscitate parasitic speculative financial markets. With unemployment rampant and Jeff Bezos’ net worth swelling by the billions daily, Sanders had the temerity to say: “If Trump can put a trillion and a half into the banking system, we can protect the wages of everyday workers.”

snip

>Monday morning quarterbacks have been unkindly critical of Sanders for not going for the jugular against Biden. But despite criticisms, Sanders did what some leftists have been asking politicians to do. He stayed on message, stuck to the issues, and did not get lost in the weeds of ad hominem snipes.

>What Sanders didn’t do is politically critique the Obama/Biden record, hamstrung by his determination not to harm the Democratic Party. The courtesy was not returned, to say the least. Unlike Trump in 2016, who savaged the Republican establishment and won, Sanders pulled his punches and lost.

snip

>Sanders arguably could have beaten Trump but not the DNC. Or to turn that around, had the DNC not sandbagged him, Sanders surely would have beaten his Democratic rivals and gone on to defeat the incumbent president…if what passes for the “liberal” establishment (e.g., the Pelosi and Schumer) didn’t sabotage him.

snip

>Sanders proved on one hand that a sizable potential constituency would support and fund a progressive agenda. On the other hand, the Democrats – who would rather risk four more years of Trump than back someone with a mild New Deal agenda – are the graveyard for such a movement. The Democratic Party is an instrument of class rule and not a democratic institution.

>For all his remarkable accomplishments, Sanders’ legacy in 2020 will likely be that of 2016, which was to be the sheepdog that herded progressives into the Democratic Party and got nothing in return.

>If your obsession in life is to defeat Trump, by all means hold your nose and vote for what you perceive as the lesser evil. But if your interest is broader – to pull the US political spectrum to the left and buck the neoliberal tide of imperial plunder and austerity for the working class, instead of encouraging the Democrats to be more reactionary than the Republicans – then vote for a left party such as Peace and Freedom or Green."
2020-04-17,Sygaldry,RedWingShoes,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/RedWingShoes/comments/g382as/a_gift_to_myself_to_commemorate_a_promotion/fnprbpz/,"I'm generally really frugal, almost to a fault and in the past when I've received windfalls, promotions, or bonuses, I've used the money to pay down loans or debt aggressively, or socked the money away in investments when co-workers or friends would buy fancy watches or even nice cars.

With the Coronavirus going on, I decided I needed to treat myself for a recent promotion otherwise I'd go crazy in quarantine.

For as long as I can remember, two boots have been my grails - the Alden 405 and the 9060, with the 9060 edging them out for the top spot in recent years.

I bought these from Grown and Sewn at retail price (somehow around the same price or cheaper than some seconds are going for on eBay...)

These are my second pair of Red Wings (first is a pair of well worn CRT Iron Rangers). Ironically, my wife has more pairs of red wings than I do - after I bought a pair of Moc Toes for her for Christmas she's been hooked!

In any case, I initially was set on the 8849 Black Prairie Moc Toes (I knew I definitely wanted a tea core leather) but it just didn't work for my feet. Then there was the 3345 but for $80 more I said why not?

The 9060 fits so well! I know some of you folks have trouble taking the same size for other 8 last boots and the Beckman Flatboxes but these fit even better than the Iron Rangers do for me. My feet are kind of uniquely shaped, where they're longer and wider but lower volume - with the Iron Rangers, while they fit pretty well, I definitely notice the extra space. On the other hand, the moc toes just don't work at all - either I size up and they're way too big or I take my normal size and my toes get jammed up. With these, my feet are snug but not cramped.

Also... the leather. Wow... the Black Klondike just feels quite a bit nicer than the Black Prairie - no real comparison when comparing them side by side. I have a few pairs of ""nicer"" dress shoes with what some would consider some of most popular leathers (CXL and Shell Cordovan, etc) but for some reason I just feel more drawn to the Black Klondike. Also, I haven't really worn dressier shoes since switching career paths so those shoes are just sitting in storage because I just haven't had the occasion to wear them in the past few years.

The silhouette just works great for so many situations, I don't think I'd feel too out of place wearing these with a suit to a wedding nor would I feel weird out wearing them around town with jeans. And man is the Gro Cord a nice step up from the Vibram minilugs. The minilugs feel like walking on wood planks compared to the Gro Cord... Would it be strange if I resoled my Iron Rangers with Gro Cord or Roccia soles?

I've been wearing them around the house and getting weird looks from my wife but I love them so much!

Anyway, I love these boots and can't wait to break them in and beat them up (within reason of course - I plan on keeping them for as long as I can walk)!

Would love suggestions on how to take care of them so that they last as long as possible, and maybe lace suggestions because the waxed laces they come with are annoying and seem flimsy/cheap."
2020-04-17,CKingX123,Coronavirus,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/g36oqk/who_issues_warning_on_coronavirus_testing_theres/fnppv6l/,"The issue I have with coronavirus antibody testing is just that we need more research. Let's talk about a few issues that I have:

1. Cross-reactivity of human coronavirus antibodies: The main issue is that these tests can also pick up the common cold human coronaviruses. The issue here? Anywhere from ""75-99% of all humans have antibodies to one or more of the common-cold causing coronaviruses."" So, if it starts detecting those, the tests are useless. The FDA right now is authorizing tests quickly because of Emergency Use rather than putting it through proper testing right now (the specificity of the test). This should be stopped as the last thing we want is for people to think they are immune when they are not, and causing the pandemic and the cases to worsen.
2. The types of antibodies; The main antibodies for immunity is the neutralizing antibody. This typically targets the S protein (which the coronavirus uses to enter cells) There are other antibodies whose job is to alert the immune system ""Hey! We have a virus here."" The problem is the test determines all antibodies that can target the coronavirus, not just the neutralizing antibodies (and these are the ones that provide long-lasting and effective immunity) While you can conduct a specialized test for neutralizing antibodies, this requires a lab and is way too slow, cumbersome, and expensive to do it at scale and none of these antibodies tests do that. That said, like with SARS, neutralizing antibodies may be proportional to all antibodies (which is not true for all diseases). Right now, we don't know, but if this is the case, then we can use it. The main thing here is that we must wait to see if they even will be effective before rolling the antibody tests out.
3. We must also deal with an issue with all tests: false positives and false negatives. False negatives may not cause as much harm as it means you will maintain social distancing (though a test shouldn't have a low detection rate as then it is not very useful). But false positives can be disastrous. The reason is that even if false positives are extremely low, the sheer number of people who don't have coronavirus means it can have more false positives than actual detections. If you are having a hard time comprehending how (and the statistics behind), this [video by Veritasium](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R13BD8qKeTg) should help. Here, people who don't have immunity may engage in social activities and catch coronavirus due to false positives.
4. Here finally is the issue of immunity is how long it lasts. We know that people can keep getting coronavirus-based cold viruses because they are so mild that immunity does not last very long at all (at max a few months without exposure). For SARS and MERS, immunity lasts for at least a year and typically over (though those diseases are more severe than SARS-CoV-2). However, I don't really consider this an issue as we can just make the immunity cards with short validity (3 months or 6 months before going through the antibody test again to renew) until we know how long it should last.

&#x200B;

So, essentially, the main issue here is that we need to know how well total antibodies correlate with neutralizing antibodies. In the mean time, the FDA should fully review the current tests rather than issuing them quickly. Once reviewed, the FDA should hold off of actually certifying it until the results of the correlation comes back. Then it can approve all the tests that passed the full review at once. The immunity card, if implemented, should have a short validity period until we learn how long the immunity lasts. But, the key thing here is that we need more research before we can implement it, and right now it is a terrible idea to implement it. Even in Wuhan, random testing revealed that only about 2% of the people have had coronavirus (which, by the way, suggests that not many people have had it. Also, at least based on the result, means it is not detecting human coronaviruses either), so we would still be a long way off from herd immunity, so anyone wishing for herd immunity to work soon is missing the whole point.

Please read

""Pandemic"" is NOT, I repeat NOT about 
coronavirus/covid-19. The pattern doesn't mention it at all. 

The pattern has information about:
What a pandemic is...
How a pandemic starts...
Phases of a pandemic...
What to expect during a pandemic...
What you can do to help prepare/get through...

It contains reputable sources from where I got my information.

We are all stuck at home, unless were essential workers, and by the way a BIG thank you to all essential workers. This idea came to me because we need to keep our minds busy. We need something to do. This sad experience has inspired me to learn more. To try my best to help. It is FREE, I am not charging at all for the CAL. It will run at least 6 weeks. Every portion is free. 

It will give us something to do, some information to read and learn about pandemics in general. And a sense of community.

So I want to make sure I explained this, but not because I have to. Because I want to. I can't wait to start the CAL and see all the awesome blankets that will leave a beautiful memory in the midst of these hard times. And give you information to take away."

I’m 26. My stepfather (moms husband) passed away April 7th. Since then, myself and my 2 bothers as well as my bf have been living with my mom full time. We were also here with her when he died as he was home under hospice care. She has a huge friend network and many supportive colleagues and other family...but to be completely honest, idk how well she’d have fared without us here. It’s a big house, she lives in a different area of the country than her parents and siblings rn, coronavirus keeps 99% of visitors away, etc. I’m a fence sitter myself and wonder about this too because it’s definitely a valid concern. Children, at least adult ones, can provide immense support when a spouse dies. My older brother is 28 and my youngest, 18. We are caring for her, not the other way around. Friends and other family are great but it’s not the same as children who will literally move back in with you indefinitely. I plan to stay for months. Just wanted to add that perspective in since it seems to be lacking on here. But yeah, I struggle with the same question. I suppose we just have to plan for it accordingly? I don’t know."

A group of workers at the clinic of the Mexican Institute of Social Security in the municipality of Los Reyes, Michoacán, threatened to burn people infected with coronavirus at the health center.

In a video that circulates on social networks, **the fury and threats of one of the employees are heard** , **which even challenges one of the managers to forcibly leave the place.**

""Look cousin, nobody is going to be treated here with coronaviruses; here we are going to burn them and this is the last time I come. They are going to come or I will see them ... somewhere else,"" he warned.

Internal sources of IMSS pointed out that **this is a group of workers who were misinformed by a local media.**

The newsletter announced, without support, that this clinic **was to be converted into a** **retraining** **hospital** **to serve positive** **COVID-** **19** **patients** **.**

That version was denied by the Social Security authorities and emphasized that **this clinic will only be, like any other, receiving patients.**

That clarification, they explained, was made yesterday Wednesday to the workers of that health center, to whom they reiterated that it is not in the conversion catalog.

After the meeting of managers of the IMSS Delegation in Michoacán with clinic staff, the activities returned to normal in that health center."

What I learned is that I needed to pull away from my Q and live my life in a healthy manner. I was getting sucked into their down-spiral whenever I made it my mission to rescue, save, and influence them.  I'm not more powerful than their addiction, so I can't cure it or prevent it, and I can't convince them that they need help, no matter how many ways I try. When I continued to engage with my Q, it always wore me down because it required me to re-work my life around their problem, ignoring my own life path and destroying my own emotional health. This resulted in two lives in crisis instead of one. 

Have faith in your friend and never stop loving them. Don't push. Encourage them by telling them you know they're struggling and it's crushing-hard, but you believe in them and know they can get succeed in recovery when they're finally ready. Then step aside and leave them to their choices. (As an aside, it's healthy to set a boundary that you cannot stay in a roommate situation with someone who's actively drinking or doing drugs. Moving may not be an option right now because of the coronavirus, but you and your sober roommate can set limits about drinking in the house, and model sober habits and behavior.)

I'm hoping for success for your friend and healthy detachment for you! It says a lot about your character that you are so kind and caring -- and paradoxically, it requires someone who is kind and caring to set the boundaries and limits that an addict needs (giving them ""reality therapy"")."

There are restrictions along with the reopening, however: Groups must be confined to five people, everyone must wear a mask or face cover of some sort, and no one (except for those from the same household) can be within six feet of one another.

>As a travel journalist and someone who cares deeply about the future of our planet, the moral dilemma of air travel is something I constantly grapple with. I’ve reduced the number of trips I take, buy carbon offsets when I travel and focus my assignments on stories that allow me to tackle conservation issues whenever possible. But the positive effect these measures have had is hard to quantify.

>What isn’t as nebulous is this: when the world stays home, the planet benefits. There’s nothing good about the coronavirus, but with a ban on non-essential travel and some countries in lockdown, we’re able to witness what happens to the Earth when we’re largely absent for the first time.

>Polluted Chinese cities have seen a dramatic reduction in nitrogen dioxide levels over recent months (Credit: Liyao Xie/Getty Images)

>In light of these startling statistics – in conjunction with the visible signs of environmental relief we’ve seen as the world stays home to beat Covid-19 – the question needs to be posed: when we can travel again, should we?

>“There's just no way to have a safe climate and the business-as-usual plan with the aviation industry,” said Nicholas.

>Biofuels offer a solution, but we may not have enough land to spare (Credit: Abadonian/Getty Images)

>If we want to meet the Paris Agreement’s target of limiting global warming to 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels by 2030, we need to make significant changes to how we travel. Part of this is going to have to come from within the airline and transportation industries.

>Overtourism is just another form of overconsumption

>City streets around the world are deserted as countries try to stop the spread of the coronavirus (Credit: Noam Galai/Getty Images)

>“Overtourism is just another form of overconsumption,” said Shannon Stowell, CEO of the Adventure Travel Trade Association and sustainable travel advocate. “I'm fine seeing tourism numbers lower overall and for the quality of tourism to increase, where people understand the destination better and have a positive impact on it versus overcrowding and pollution and wildlife habitat loss – which are all outcomes of too much tourism,” he added.

>Carbon offsets help and they absolutely move the needle

>We can also alleviate some of the environmental stress of travel simply by keeping more of our adventures local. “This is actually the biggest impact we can have,” said Nicholas. “I used to be a frequent flyer, but I’ve found other ways to find that kind of novelty and adventure. Basically, slow travel and self-powered travel.” This might look like enjoying your local beach instead of one in Mexico and saving your carbon budget for a more impactful trip.

>When we do fly, we can purchase carbon offsets. “Carbon offsets help and they absolutely move the needle,” said Murphy. They're not as good as actually reducing the emissions from travel so you're not completely undoing all the harm, but they help.” When trying to decide what kind of offset to purchase, it’s vital to donate to a project that’s additional, meaning that it didn’t exist beforehand. So, when you donate to a cause that’s protecting deforestation, make sure the land in question wasn’t going to be protected anyway.

>How we fly also matters. As enticing as the extra legroom in business class is, purchasing those seats also increases your carbon footprint because it means less passengers per plane. “The more densely packed you are, the lower your emissions are per passenger mile by quite a bit,” Murphy notes. “At a policy level, we need transparency about the true environmental impact of our choices, and we need prices to align with those impacts,” said Austin Brown, executive director of the Policy Institute at UC Davis. “For example, making first-class tickets cost more.” (The price tag on first-class seats is used to subsidise cheap economy tickets, reducing the overall cost of travel and allowing more people to fly.)

>Exploring the world gives us the global perspective we need to care about the future of our planet (Credit: Art Wager/Getty Images)

>When we’re on the ground in a destination, we can reduce our footprint by being respectful to the area’s culture and environment. “When you travel to a new place, you’re a guest in their home,” said Stowell. Part of accomplishing this is to choose sustainable accommodation and activities, and a green mode of transportation to explore the place you’re in. This might mean partnering with a sustainable local tour operator who is more familiar with the tourism landscape, which is also a way to give back to the local economy.

>There are destinations, worldwide, reliant on travel and tourism for survival

>“We still need travel,” Guihan added. “Tourism is one of the biggest employers in the world and there are destinations, worldwide, reliant on travel and tourism for survival.”

>Outside of the global tourism economy, travel has the potential to benefit all of us. When we travel in a meaningful way, we gain cross-cultural understanding and develop greater empathy for people outside of our immediate circle. Travel gives us the global perspective we need to care about the future of our home here on Earth.

>Slow and self-powered travel are good ways to reduce environmental stress (Credit: Skyimages/Getty Images)

>Throughout my career as a journalist, I’ve shared mint tea with Bedouins in the middle of the desert in Jordan, looked into the eyes of a mountain gorilla in the lush jungles of Rwanda and tracked tigers under a white-hot sun with local naturalists in India. These experiences have given me a deep appreciation for the vast, diverse, infinitely beautiful world we live in, and a desire to protect it.

>Our ability to wander has been temporarily taken from us, and never has it felt like more of a luxury. “This crisis might give us the opportunity to instill a new travel mindset,” said Stowell. “Travel is a privilege, not a right.”

>I can’t imagine a world without travel, but I know that if we don’t change how we travel, there won’t be a planet left for us to explore."

My dad used to be a private investigator who had gotten a gun permit.

As Keir Starmer embarks on a similarly arduous task, Mandelson is hopeful a new generation can climb the “steep mountain” ahead**

For a man who has spent much of his career being pejoratively referred to as the ‘Prince of Darkness’, Peter Mandelson is currently emitting rays of positivity.

That is not to say that he is somehow ambivalent about, or at ease with, the current situation. Instead, he is preferring to seek out the positive, rather than dwell on the negative. 

The first spark of optimism has come from the development of an NHS contact tracing app for the coronavirus, which he argues could inspire innovation in the healthcare system. “In this sense, we shouldn’t waste the crisis and the terrible suffering it has inflicted on people,” he says.

“We need a modern health system that takes full advantage of data, both for diagnostics and continuing care, as well as artificial intelligence where it can be deployed, to target resources and to enhance therapeutic care and recovery. Let’s not simply talk ourselves down into a stupor of despair about this, ghastly as the medical crisis is. We can learn and improve things for the better.”

 While a “sledgehammer” has been taken to the economy, Mandelson argues there is an understanding that the burden of sacrifice will have to fall on “everyone’s shoulders equally, according to their resources and what they can pay”. As a result, he continues, Britain will be a “better and more equitable society”. “That is another gain that we can seize from what has been a terrible experience.”

For all of these reasons, there has been a perception that politics in the post-corona world will be firmly in Labour’s sweet spot. “Many Labour people are expecting policy to move much more onto our territory, as demands grow for the protection and security offered by a strong state and the public services it delivers. And, of course, this is right. Boris Johnson has recognised this by stating emphatically that there is such a thing as society,” says Mandelson.

However, he urges caution about taking away the wrong message.

“Now, just as the Tories will need to face up to the tax implications of this realisation, because no longer can our public services and welfare system be run on the cheap, so too must Labour address public concerns and priorities realistically and in a modern way, and not take ideological license to pursue old-fashioned notions of socialism. That would be the wrong lesson to take from the coronavirus crisis,” he says.

“Labour’s 2019 manifesto was written by different people for different times, and whatever the merits of its individual policies, we have to understand that we are now facing demands and challenges of a very different kind and magnitude in order to rescue the UK economy and to rebuild so much of it. The world has changed as a result of this pandemic, and Labour’s policy making must adjust to new realities.”"

The Italian federation of doctors has a message for those who build castles in the air based on theoretical modelling of Covid-19, and for those credulous enough to base policy on such models.

“Whoever is handling the numbers is either incompetent or living in a parallel universe,” said Dr Paola Pedrini, head of the federation’s Lombardy chapter, currently facing the pandemic onslaught.

Those dying at home or in care homes are not being recorded as coronavirus deaths. The true death toll is multiples higher. “We don’t want data confusion to hide the general responsibility for the ‘Caporetto’ of the Italian health system.”

The Battle of Caporetto was where the Italian front across the Isondo collapsed in late 1917 under a combined Austro-Hungarian and German attack, despite General Cadorno’s policy of ‘decimation’ for underperforming regiments.

By all means let us have a lively national debate over the rights and wrongs of shutting down normal economic and social existence for three to six months in order to save lives, but let it be based on reality. Only then can we make an informed moral decision.

We have a ‘real time’ laboratory before our eyes. What is happening at the Italian coal face is not remotely consistent with claims being made by some that the death rate from Covid-19 is akin to seasonal winter flu at around 0.1pc.

Many have jumped on the Oxford ‘Gupta’ study to claim that we already have herd immunity reaching 50pc or 60pc of the population. Actually, the study merely explores a hypothesis. It concludes that a high level of early spread is theoretically possible, and that therefore we should go for antibody testing quickly to find out who has had the disease. We can all agree to that.

The Gupta analysis is not peer-reviewed but you can get a flavour of reactions in the scientific world from the PubPeer page and from named experts at the Science Media Centre.

The mayors of Bergamo and Brescia - two Covid-19 hotspots - say the reported deaths in their cities are a small fraction of the true numbers. An epidemiological portrait is easy to construct. You compare deaths since January with seasonal averages over recent years. Corriere Della Sera has done exactly that.

The small town of Nembro has 11,600 inhabitants. Typically it would have 35 deaths over the first quarter. This year it had already had 158 deaths by March 24. Yet the official data counts just 31 Covid-19 mortalities. The implication is that the real pandemic death rate has been four times higher.

The same method showed that deaths were 6.1 times normal in Cernusco and Pesaro, and 10.4 times higher in the city of Bergamo. This is partly because Covid-19 care is crowding out treatment for other diseases. But that changes nothing in practical terms. It is all part of the same drama.

The much higher death toll conforms with the grim accounts by doctors facing a lack of beds, ventilators, and ECMO oxygen equipment. They are forced to separate young from old, sending the over-70s home to take their chances.

This is taking place in the richest part of Italy with world class hospitals. It is what happens if governments delay and let their health care systems break under the strain of exploding Covid-19 cases. Italy was taken by surprise. Britain had weeks of prior warning.

The Corriere analysis also conforms with estimates of a 1.4pc death rate in China published by the University of Hong Kong in a widely-praised Nature study (this one peer-reviewed).

You can look at the Italian figures another way. La Stampa reported this morning - for example - that registered Covid-19 deaths in Alessandria have reached 155. That is already 0.16pc of the entire 94,000 population of the town even if you accept official mortality data - and we know that they are not all infected. It is the same story for nearby Biella and Verbani. The flu parallel is obvious nonsense.

South Korea has done over 300,000 tests and kept up a rigorous policy of tracing and isolation. Its mortality rate from Covid-19 has been creeping up as slow deaths come in. The country currently records 158 fatalities out of 9,661 positive cases, a ratio of over 1.6pc. The Koreans have undoubtedly missed cases. The tests often give false negatives. But it would be unwise for Britain to base policy on the premise that they are massively wrong.

The recorded death rates so far in countries that test widely is: Norway 0.7pc, Germany 0.9pc, Austria 1.1pc, and Switzerland 2.1pc. They all have good health care systems.

Arctic Iceland has a much lower ratio at 0.2pc. This is interesting but it would be folly for any major state to rely on signals from that one tiny nation. How efficiently does the viral load transmit in glacial temperatures at 63 degrees latitude? There may be variables that make extrapolation dangerous.

The question I have for those in Britain who argue that we should call off the lockdown and restart the economy is what would happen if the virus were allowed to run wild and the death ratios were to track Lombardy.

You would be looking at a weekly death rate in late Spring that was four, five, or ten times normal and that would overwhelm the critical care facilities of the NHS many times over. There could be an extra 500,000 or 600,000 deaths before the pandemic burnt itself out.

The tragedy - or scandal - would shatter the reputation of this country. We would no longer have any claim to moral leadership. Authoritarian regimes would have shown more care for their people. The credibility of this Government would be destroyed. This is the tail-risk - not a prediction, nota bene - that policy-makers must ponder.

One has the impression that the Government’s original strategy of herd immunity was crafted in the bureaucratic hothouse of the SAGE committee during those crucial wasted weeks in late January and February without regard for reality on the ground, first in Wuhan, and then in Italy.

Boris Johnson overruled bad counsel in the nick of time. This was a crucial decision that may just have saved the NHS and his own political future. My advice to the Prime Minister now is simple: don’t recoil and repeat the error; don’t listen to those who urge capitulation in order to ‘save the economy’. The emergency measures of Rishi Sunak have already saved the economy.

The worst thing this Government can do to commercial businesses now is to pursue a half-baked policy of partial containment that causes the pandemic to drag on for six months. The sooner this virus is contained - and then managed with the East Asian formula of ‘test, trace, isolate’ until we have a vaccine - the sooner the economy will come roaring back."

Objective To investigate the efficacy and safety of recombinant human interferon alpha1b (rhIFN-α) nasal drops in healthy medical staff to prevent 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19). Methods A prospective, open-label study was conducted. Starting January 21, 2020, at Taihe Hospital in Shiyan City, Hubei Province, 2944 medical staff members were recruited and allocated into a low-risk group or a high-risk group according to whether they were directly exposed to the coronavirus. Participants in the low-risk group received rhIFN-α nasal drops (2-3 drops/nostril/time, 4 times/day) for 28 days; those in the high-risk group received rhIFN-α nasal drops combined with thymosin-α1 (1.6 mg, hypodermic injection, once a week). The primary outcome was new-onset COVID-19 over 28 days. The secondary outcome was new-onset fever or respiratory symptoms but with negative pulmonary images. The results were compared with the number of new cases in medical staff in the same areas of Hubei Province (including Wuhan) during the same period. Adverse reactions to interferon nasal drops were also observed. Results Among the 2944 subjects in our study, 2415 were included in the low-risk group, including 997 doctors and 1418 nurses with average ages of 37.38 and 33.56 years, respectively; 529 were included in the high-risk group, including 122 doctors and 407 nurses with average ages of 35.24 and 32.16 years, respectively. The 28-day incidence of COVID-19 was zero in both the high- and low-risk groups. The 28-day incidence of new-onset clinical symptoms with negative images for pneumonia was also zero in both the high- and low-risk groups. As controls, a total of 2035 medical personnel with confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia from the same area (Hubei Province) was observed between January 21 to February 23, 2020. There were no serious adverse effects in the 2944 subjects treated during the intervention period. Conclusion In this investigator-initiated open-label study, we observed that rhIFN-α nasal drops can effectively prevent COVID-19 in treated medical personnel. Our results also indicate that rhIFN-α nasal drops have potential promise for protecting susceptible healthy people during the coronavirus pandemic."

In NYC, nursing homes account for 1 in 4 coronavirus deaths.

And for age groups, I can't find exact comparisons, but this strongly suggests that NYC death rate is not higher for young people than it was in Italy:

So we have a much greater CO2 sink as well as a severely reduced human emissions, yet atmospheric CO2 is breaking records daily.  You're going to need to abandon logic if you want to explain this away with ""but, but, but climate change!"".

Climate scientists are currently [watching CO2 levels](https://www.climatechangenews.com/2020/03/26/coronavirus-hawaii-scientists-seek-signs-economic-slowdown-air/) like hawks, praying for it to go down, even though it never did in previous recessions.  It's like Christians anxiously waiting for the second coming that they've been promised.

>Recessions, like the 2008-09 financial crisis or even the 1991 collapse of the Soviet Union, did not cause a discernible drop. And other factors that have tended to drive the curve up more steeply, such as the economic rise of China this century, were not visible as sudden events.

Hmm...maybe Jesus isn't coming after all?"
