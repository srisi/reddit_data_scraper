They are supposed to help battle epidemics among other things around the world. When it was conceived in 1948, it was thought to be in the best interest of the planet to have an organization who can help on a global level. They have handled things like the ebola outbreaks and generally assist more countries which don't have the resources to handle outbreaks. In case of a global catastrophic event, they would help coordinate a global response. Needless to say, this is pretty much the first time that has happened since its inception at this scale.   

If you download the [PDF from the WHO's website](https://www.who.int/about/finances-accountability/funding/assessed-contributions/en/), you can see exact contributions. It looks like their budget is done every 3 months and the US paid roughly around 60 million per quarter of its 250m dollar budget. Looking at the numbers for 2020 Mar 31 and 2019 Dec 31, it looks to be consistent so its about 240m per year of a 1 billion USD budget, or 24%. I've seen varying numbers as little at 15% and as high as 25% but I am using the WHOs own website and budget PDFs. The important thing is not that the exact number but to know that the US is the largest contributor and obviously, pulling out causes a big disruption to the flow of cash.   

Do we get 240m worth in return? That is the big question that has wider reaching facets in the answer. It is difficult to answer this without bias. For starters, to answer back with a question, are we looking to get something back from it? In some people's eyes, the WHO is goodwill for those less fortunate who otherwise would be extremely devastated. Next, it is hard to calculate benefit when it comes from secondary prevention of a pandemic. For example, we don't know how much we benefited from say, a stopping of ebola in Africa and preventing it from spreading to other countries like the US. However, it should be noted that the concept of global organizations (like the UN, NATO, etc) having the US as a big contributor without reaping a proportional amount of benefits or without other countries paying their proportional amount is an argument that has been debated way longer than Trump has been in office. The whether or not this is worth it is up to you to decide.    

The bigger issue is that the WHO is supposed to be neutral and effective in a situation like this. However, to many (reaching outside of the US as well), the WHO has been suspiciously [cozy with the Chinese narrative of events](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2020/04/world-health-organization-blame-pandemic-coronavirus/609820/). It should be noted that South Korea and other regional countries questioned the Chinese story of events long before the US was even on pandemic mode, so this isn't just the US making these claims. Note that this perceived favoritism is nothing new for these big global organizations and is often more of a nuisance than a serious problem. However, the claim by the US is that in this case, it caused serious issues if the WHO is in fact deliberately just following Chinese orders as is the claim."

Yet he blames the WHO for having too much Chinese influence. This defunding is all a massive finger-pointing game so people will stop blaming him for his incompetence. 

How the fuck is the WHO supposed to become less China influenced if the US pulls out funding. That just leaves a massive power vacuum for China to grab. 

Also the WHO (when it’s not in a pandemic) is a massively helpful organization that helps nations with their fights against diseases. Defunding the WHO likely means that families in low-income nations that need medical support and vaccinations from the WHO may not get it this time all because Trump doesn’t want to take responsibility for his stupidity.

Half of Reddit has no clue what the fuck the WHO does (and that’s not because they don’t do anything its because of ignorance and trying to cope with shit by pointing fingers)."

>Good evening once again to everyone in the room, and to everyone online. Once again, I’d like to thank Dr Didier Houssin, who has done a  superb job of leading the Emergency Committee through what was a very  complex deliberation. My thanks again to all the members of the  committee for their time, expertise and full commitment.   
>  
>I am not declaring a public health emergency of international concern today. As it was yesterday, the Emergency Committee was divided over whether  the outbreak of novel coronavirus represents a PHEIC or not. Make no mistake. This is an emergency in China, but it has not yet become a global health emergency. It may yet become one. WHO’s risk assessment is that the outbreak is a very high risk in China, and a high risk regionally and globally. 584 cases have now been reported to WHO, including 17 deaths. 575 of  those cases and all of the deaths have been reported in China, with  other cases reported in Japan, the Republic of Korea, Singapore,  Thailand, the United States of America and Vietnam. We are aware of  media reports of suspected cases in other countries, but those cases are  still being investigated.  
>  
>Let me talk about what we know. We know that this virus can cause severe disease, and that it can kill, although for most people it causes milder symptoms. We know that among those infected, one quarter of patients have experienced severe disease. We know that most of those who have died had underlying health  conditions such as hypertension, diabetes or cardiovascular disease that  weakened their immune systems. We know that there is human-to-human transmission in China, but for  now it appears limited to family groups and health workers caring for  infected patients. At this time, there is no evidence of human-to-human transmission outside China, but that doesn’t mean it won’t happen. There is still a lot we don’t know. We don’t know the source of this  virus, we don’t understand how easily it spreads, and we don’t fully  understand its clinical features or severity.  
>  
>WHO is working with our partners night and day in China and the other  affected countries, at the regional level and here at headquarters to  fill the gaps in our knowledge as quickly as possible. It is likely that we will see more cases in other parts of China and other countries. China has taken measures it believes appropriate to contain the spread of coronavirus in Wuhan and other cities. We hope that they will be both effective and short in their duration. For the moment, WHO does not recommend any broader restrictions on travel or trade. We recommend exit screening at airports as part of a comprehensive set of containment measures. All countries should have in place measures to detect cases of coronavirus, including at health facilities. The committee has made several recommendations to prevent the further  spread of the virus, which the Chair has described, and which I have  accepted. There are a few simple things we can all do to protect ourselves and  each other, like washing hands, covering your mouth and nose when you  sneeze, and so on.

>  
>This outbreak was detected because China had put in place a system  specifically to pick up severe lower respiratory infections. It was that  system that caught this event. I wish to reiterate that the fact I am not declaring a PHEIC today  should not be taken as a sign that WHO does not think the situation is  serious, or that we are not taking it seriously. Nothing could be further from the truth. WHO is following this outbreak every minute of every day, at country, regional and global level. We are working to prevent human-to-human transmission. We have provided guidance to all countries for the rapid identification, management and containment of the virus. We are coordinating our networks of global experts. We are working to advance the development of diagnostics, therapeutics and vaccines. We are completely committed to ending this outbreak as soon as possible. And I will not hesitate to reconvene the committee at a moment’s  notice - anytime. It could be in a day, it could be in a couple, it  could be anytime.

>WASHINGTON — The lone member of the nascent Congressional Oversight Commission created as part of President Trump’s $2 trillion economic stimulus law is calling on the Federal Reserve to release detailed information about which companies receive loans from its emergency lending facilities and how the money is being used.

>The request comes amid growing concern that disbursements from the giant economic stabilization package will be shrouded in secrecy or used improperly. In recent weeks, the Fed and the Treasury Department have rolled out a half-dozen emergency lending facilities that will allow the Fed to inject $4 trillion into almost every corner of financial markets. But who will be getting what remains murky.

>In a letter sent on Wednesday to Jerome H. Powell, the Fed chair, and Steven Mnuchin, the Treasury secretary, Bharat Ramamurti, the only person appointed to the Congressional Oversight Commission so far, demanded clarity.

>“I write to respectfully request that the Federal Reserve publicly release detailed and timely information about each individual transaction,” Mr. Ramamurti wrote. “The public deserves to know which companies are receiving taxpayer-backed lending through the Fed and on what terms, and to be able to monitor what those companies do after receiving taxpayer support.”

>Mr. Ramamurti asked the Fed to provide details about the identity of borrowers, the terms of the loans and the intended use of the proceeds. He is also seeking full deal documents, information about the equity supporting the deals, and proof that the money is not going to foreign businesses or companies controlled by White House officials or members of Congress and their families.

>The Fed, which avoids taking credit risk on its own, is using Treasury funds authorized by Congress to buy corporate and municipal bonds and to provide lending to mid-sized businesses as part of an effort to keep credit flowing as the coronavirus pandemic shutters large parts of the economy. Congress gave the Treasury Department $454 billion to back up the Fed’s efforts, which need to be insured against losses.

>The economic relief legislation that Mr. Trump signed last month created a three-pronged oversight structure: a special inspector general within the Treasury Department, a committee of inspectors general and the Congressional Oversight Commission, which is selected by the majority and minority leaders of the Senate as well as the House Speaker and minority leader.

>Mr. Ramamurti, a former aide to Senator Elizabeth Warren, Democrat of Massachusetts, was the first person selected to what will ultimately be a five-person commission that will oversee the bailout fund being run by the Treasury Department.

>There have been growing concerns that Mr. Trump will not comply with oversight efforts, particularly after his selection of a White House lawyer, Brian D. Miller, to serve as the special inspector general at Treasury and his firing of the Pentagon’s inspector general, Glenn A. Fine, who had been tapped by the Council of the Inspectors General on Integrity to lead the new Pandemic Response Accountability Committee.

>The economic stimulus legislation requires the Fed and Treasury to turn over an array of information after disbursing loans. However, Mr. Ramamurti is concerned that the information could be provided in aggregate, making it difficult for watchdogs or taxpayers to know how the money is being spent and which specific companies or sectors are benefiting.

>The Fed and the Treasury Department did not immediately respond to requests for comment."

They are already planning for this in Germany and NYC. Right now, most public health officials believe that once you catch this virus, 99.9% of people are immune for the forseeable future. This isn't necessarily true for everyone as some people just don't make good antibodies for this, but it's blanket enough that we can act on it. The idea is that once they can prove you have antibodies for it, you can be given permission to rejoin society as though nothing happened. 

We don't know how far this virus spread, but a serological sample of one town in Germany showed that 15% of people carried antibodies for covid-19. It's not unrealistic to think that any hard hit area will have 20-25% immunity in a month. Most people in this town did not know they had caught the Coronavirus. They either thought they had a flu, bad cold, or were asymptomatic. 

This will likely create a problem as many construction job sites and public facing jobs (i.e. bartender) will require a statement of immunity to hire you for safety reasons. This will lead to a blue collar divide where only immune people will be able to provide for their families, and you may even feel encouraged to get the virus so you can get over it, get immune, and get a job."

> The change – which alters what certain business owners are allowed to deduct from their taxes – will allow some of the nation’s wealthiest to avoid nearly $82bn of tax liability in 2020.

> Nearly 82% of the benefits from the tax law change will go to people making $1m or more annually in 2020, according to an analysis by the joint committee on taxation (JCT). Overall, 95% of individuals who benefit from the change make $200,000 or more.

> Taxpayers will lose nearly $90bn from the change, which suspends a restriction introduced in the 2017 tax bill.

> The change allows owners of businesses known as pass-through entities to lower their taxes by deducting as much as they want against income unrelated to the business.

> Before, owners of pass-through entities could deduct a maximum of $250,000 in losses from non-business income such as stocks and bonds. This limitation was introduced in the 2017 tax law as a way to offset other tax benefits going to firms.

> Republicans said it was a mistake to include the provision in the 2017 legislation and moved to temporarily suspend it in the $2tn Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (Cares) act passed in late March.

> Because of the suspension, the JCT estimated 43,000 people making $1m or more would owe a total of $70.3bn less in taxes in 2020. Less than 3% of the benefits from the change will go to Americans earning less than $100,000 a year.

>Steve Rosenthal, a tax expert at the Tax Policy Center, a non-partisan thinktank, told the Washington Post hedge-fund investors and owners of real estate would benefit most from the change.

> Alan Viard of the American Enterprise Institute thinktank said the change should be made permanent. “The tax relief gives businesses badly needed liquidity during the coronavirus pandemic while also reducing the tax penalty on risky business investments,” Viard wrote in a blogpost.

> The JCT analysis was prompted by two Democratic senators seeking more information from Donald Trump’s administration about changes to the tax law included in the coronavirus relief package.

> In a letter last week, senators Sheldon Whitehouse, of Rhode Island, and Lloyd Doggett, of Texas, said they were specifically seeking information about whether any people in the Trump administration who were involved with developing the changes would also benefit from the provisions.

> After the analysis was published, Whitehouse called for this provision to be repealed.

> “It’s a scandal for Republicans to loot American taxpayers in the midst of an economic and human tragedy,” Whitehouse said in a statement. “This analysis shows that while Democrats fought for unemployment insurance and small business relief, a top priority of President Trump and his allies in Congress was another massive tax cut for the wealthy.

The new coronavirus kills by inflaming and clogging the tiny air sacs in the lungs, choking off the body’s oxygen supply until it shuts down the organs essential for life.

But clinicians around the world are seeing evidence that suggests the virus also may be causing heart inflammation, acute kidney disease, neurological malfunction, blood clots, intestinal damage and liver problems. That development has complicated treatment for the most severe cases of covid-19, the illness caused by the virus, and makes the course of recovery less certain, they said.

The prevalence of these effects is too great to attribute them solely to the “cytokine storm,” a powerful immune-system response that attacks the body, causing severe damage, doctors and researchers said.

AD
Almost half the people hospitalized because of covid-19 have blood or protein in their urine, indicating early damage to their kidneys, said Alan Kliger, a Yale University School of Medicine nephrologist who co-chairs a task force assisting dialysis patients who have covid-19.

Even more alarming, he added, is early data that shows 14 to 30 percent of intensive-care patients in New York and Wuhan, China — birthplace of the pandemic — have lost kidney function and require dialysis, or its in-hospital cousin, continuous renal replacement therapy. New York intensive care units are treating so much kidney failure, he said, they need more personnel who can perform dialysis and have issued an urgent call for volunteers from other parts of the country. They also are running dangerously short of the sterile fluids used to deliver that therapy, he said.

“That’s a huge number of people who have this problem. That’s new to me,” Kliger said. “I think it’s very possible that the virus attaches to the kidney cells and attacks them.”

AD

But in medicine, logical inferences often do not prove true when research is conducted. Everyone interviewed for this story stressed that with the pandemic still raging, they are speculating with much less data than is normally needed to reach solid clinical conclusions.

Many other possible causes for organ and tissue damage must be investigated, they said, including respiratory distress, the medications patients received, high fever, the stress of hospitalization in an ICU and the now well-described impact of cytokine storms.

Still, when researchers in Wuhan conducted autopsies on people who died of covid-19, they found nine of 26 had acute kidney injuries and seven had particles of the coronavirus in their kidneys, according to a paper by the Wuhan scientists published April 9 in the medical journal Kidney International.

AD
“It does raise the very clear suspicion that at least a part of the acute kidney injury that we’re seeing is resulting from direct viral involvement of the kidney, which is distinct from what was seen in the SARS outbreak in 2002,” said Paul M. Palevsky, a University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine nephrologist and president-elect of the National Kidney Foundation.

One New York hospital recently had 51 ICU patients who needed 24-hour kidney treatment but had just 39 machines to do it, he said. The hospital had to ration the care, keeping each patient on the therapy less than 24 hours a day, he said.

The virus also may be damaging the heart. Clinicians in China and New York have reported myocarditis, an inflammation of the heart muscle, and, more dangerous, irregular heart rhythms that can lead to cardiac arrest in covid-19 patients.

AD
“They seem to be doing really well as far as respiratory status goes, and then suddenly they develop a cardiac issue that seems out of proportion to their respiratory issues,” said Mitchell Elkind, a Columbia University neurologist and president-elect of the American Heart Association. “This seems to be out of proportion to their lung disease, which makes people wonder about that direct effect.”

One review of severely ill patients in China found that about 40 percent suffered arrhythmias and 20 percent had some form of cardiac injury, Elkind said. “There is some concern that some of it may be due to direct influence of the virus,” he said.

The new virus enters the cells of people who are infected by latching onto the ACE2 receptor on cell surfaces. It unquestionably attacks the cells in the respiratory tract, but there is increasing suspicion that it is using the same doorway to enter other cells. The gastrointestinal tract, for instance, contains 100 times more of these receptors than other parts of the body, and its surface area is enormous.

AD
“If you unfurl it, it’s like a tennis court of surface area — this tremendous area for the virus to invade and replicate itself,” said Brennan Spiegel, co-editor in chief of the American Journal of Gastroenterology.

In a subset of covid-19 cases, researchers have found, the immune system battling the infection goes into hyperdrive. The uncontrolled response leads to the release of a flood of substances called cytokines that, in excess, can result in damage to multiple organs. In some severely ill covid-19 patients, doctors have found high levels of a pro-inflammatory cytokine called interleukin-6, known by the medical shorthand IL-6.

The unfettered response, also called “cytokine release syndrome,” has long been recognized in other patients, including those with autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis or in cancer patients undergoing certain immunotherapies.

AD
For covid-19 patients, cytokine storms are a major reason that some require intensive care and ventilation, said Jeffrey S. Weber, deputy director of the Perlmutter Cancer Center at NYU Langone Medical Center.

“When your cytokines are systemically out of control, bad stuff happens,” he said. “It can be a complete disaster.” It isn’t clear why cytokine storms occur in some patients and not others, though genetic factors may play a role, some doctors say.

To treat cytokine storms, some doctors are using anti-IL-6 drugs such as tocilizumab, which is approved for cancer patients who develop cytokine storms as a result of immunotherapy.

Another odd, and now well-known, symptom of covid-19 is loss of smell and taste. Claire Hopkins, president of the British Rhinological Society, said studies of patients in Italy and elsewhere have shown that some lose their sense of smell before they show signs of being sick.

AD
“The coronavirus can actually attack and invade olfactory nerve endings,” Hopkins said. When these aroma-detecting fibers are disrupted, they can’t send odors to the brain.

Anosmia — the medical term for the inability to smell — was not initially recognized as a symptom of covid-19, Hopkins said. Doctors were so overwhelmed by patients with severe respiratory problems, she said, that “they didn’t ask the question.”

But subsequent data from a symptom-tracking app has shown that 60 percent of people later diagnosed with covid-19 reported losing their senses of smell and taste. About a quarter of participants experienced anosmia before developing other symptoms, suggesting it can be an early warning sign of infection.

AD
Intriguingly, Hopkins said, people who lose their sense of smell don’t seem to develop the same severe respiratory problems that have made covid-19 so deadly. But a very small number of patients have experienced confusion, low blood oxygen levels and even lost consciousness — a sign that the virus may have traveled along their olfactory nerve endings straight to the central nervous system.

“Why you get this different expression in different people, nobody knows,” she said.

There are also reports that covid-19 can turn people’s eyes red, causing pinkeye, or conjunctivitis, in some patients. One study of 38 hospitalized patients in Hubei province, China, found that a third had pinkeye.

But like many of the non-respiratory effects of the virus, this symptom may be relatively uncommon — and may develop only in people already severely ill. The fact that the virus has been found in the mucus membrane that covers the eye in a small number of patients, however, does suggest that the eye could be an entryway for the virus — and is one reason that face shields and goggles are being used to protect health-care workers.

The virus also is having a clear impact on the gastrointestinal tract, causing diarrhea, vomiting and other symptoms. One study found that half of covid-19 patients have gastrointestinal symptoms, and specialists have coined a Twitter hashtag, #NotJustCough, to raise awareness of them."

>The finding, first reported by the Wall Street Journal, may worsen ties already strained by U.S. charges that the global COVID-19 pandemic resulted from Beijing’s mishandling of a 2019 outbreak of the coronavirus in the city of Wuhan.

>U.S. concerns about Beijing’s possible breaches of a “zero yield” standard for test blasts have been prompted by activities at China’s Lop Nur nuclear test site throughout 2019, the State Department report said.

>Zero yield refers to a nuclear test in which there is no explosive chain reaction of the type ignited by the detonation of a nuclear warhead.
“China’s possible preparation to operate its Lop Nur test site year-round, its use of explosive containment chambers, extensive excavation activities at Lop Nur and a lack of transparency on its nuclear testing activities ... raise concerns regarding its adherence to the zero yield standard,” the report said, without providing evidence of a low-yield test.

Thank you for sounding the alarm for the coronavirus back in November when you were aware of a SARS-like virus spreading around one of your major cities. 

Thank you for warning everyone, and especially telling the WHO to share, about human-to-human transmission of the virus. 

Thank you for not covering any of this up at all, as well as for letting doctors and researchers speak out and not torturing them and their families for spreading what you would call ""false information.""

Thank you for addressing the maverick research practices of your biohazard laboratories and proving everyone who thought it was a terrible idea to give you one wrong. 

Thank you for being truthful and letting us know just how many people were/are infected and the amount of deaths from the virus. 

Thank you for letting other nations and organizations into your nation to lend their hands in investigating what happened. 

Thank you for informing the world when your cases just abruptly stopped while in the middle of an exponential growth, it really helped! 

Thank you for shipping masks and other supplies to other countries in need even though they were faulty and completely useless, it's the thought that counts! 

Thank you for twisting other nations' arms into a deal with Huawei before sending that faulty equipment. 

Thank you for your honest and deep investigation that shows the true blame for coronavirus rests with the ~~wet markets~~ ~~US Military~~ ~~foreign tourists~~ Africans. 

Thank you for treating those African workers and tourists as scapegoats and locking them in their rooms and not allowing them to go dine at places open to everyone. 

Thank you for calling us out on our racism for saying ""China virus"" and blaming the CCP for this pandemic and setting the model for us to all follow in not being racist with your treatment of the African people in your country. 

Thank you for allow religious liberties to all people in your country and giving Uyghur Muslims the freedom to practice as such, the autonomy to control their own region, and not throwing them into death camps for their religious ideology and not forcing their women into marriages. 

Thank you for not sending followers of Falun Gong and other religions in your country to camps and carving them up alive to harvest their organs. 

Thank you for not violently suppressing protestors for freedom in Hong Kong even though they just keep eating that garbage Western propaganda that says the CCP is a brutal, totalitarian dictatorship that will send any who disagree to a death/labor camp along with their entire families. 

Thank you for correcting the record on the ~~Tiananmen Massacre~~ Tiananmen Insurrection and giving us the truth on those ~~peaceful student protestors~~ violent troublemaking traitors.

And, finally, thank you so much for allowing 2020 to be the best year ever by completely averting this coronavirus disaster. Without you, we would all be locked in our houses for months on end, with disastrous unemployment, a free-falling economy, no get togethers, no sports, no anything in the Spring and early Summer. Without you, we would all have to worry about this coronavirus being a danger to all for years to come and not be allowed to live our lives as we normally do. 

Thank you, China, you are surely a model nation for the rest of us around the world to follow and respect. We graciously accept your superiority over us all.

Anybody looking to herd immunity to save anybody doesn't understand basic things like math, exponential growth, medical science, statistics, and the like.

Which is why UK was pushing for herd immunity, until they suddenly weren't. Italy has been hard at work staying home, but even they have nothing but vague ideas on what and *when* to do next."

1. It's all fake news media scare tactics intended to destroy Donald Trump, so its their patriotic duty to take the extended family to Wal-Mart every other day.
2. It's real but only affects 90 year olds, and meh... who cares, they've lived their lives so the entire response and all this coronavirus concern is nonsense.

These people are lost. And they won't even understand when it hits them. One man attending this protest *WAS A CORONAVIRUS SURVIVOR* and talked about how bad it was. But even he didn't care, now he's got antibodies and everyone else can fuck off and roll the dice."

Of course, most people who assert this never actually understood what the WHO actually said. The WHO claimed that they didn't find evidence of sustained human-to-human transmission. What people didn't bother to follow up on, is that the also said that they need to collect more data and to not be surprised if the data does show sustained H2H. People also didn't realize that they acknowledged that H2H was very much possible from early on, they just didn't know if it was a sustained form of transmission, or a limited one.

> GENEVA (Reuters) - There **may have been limited human-to-human transmission of a new coronavirus in China within families, and it is possible there could be a wider outbreak**, the World Health Organization (WHO) said on Tuesday.

The truth is, most people here are too ignorant to understand the difference that the absence of evidence isn't the evidence of absence. They don't realize that science needs time to get enough data to confirm hypothesis. And they mistake the WHO's acknowledgement of the lack of clear evidence/data early on for willful deception."

>Donald Trump is threatening to use a never-before-employed power of his office to adjourn both chambers of Congress so he can make ""recess appointments"" to fill vacant positions within his administration he says Senate Democrats are keeping empty amid the coronavirus pandemic.

>Mr Trump opened his daily virus press conference on Wednesday by griping about Senate Democrats blocking tens of his nominees, alleging many otherwise would be working on virus-related efforts. He offered few specifics, however, on how the federal virus response might be different if a substantial amount of those individuals had been approved by the upper chamber.

>Article II, Section 3, Clause 3 of the US Constitution gives a president the power to adjourn both chambers if they cannot agree on an adjourn date. No chief executive, however, has ever used it.

>

>The president said he would prefer ""not doing"" the adjournment order, but feels strongly he ""needs"" to make some appointments.

>He does have another option, which many presidents have turned to when unable to convince the minority party to provide the votes needed to confirm an executive branch official: Find other nominees that are more agreeable to Democrats.

>Both chambers have been meeting in so-called pro forma sessions, though with almost no legislators present.

>On the Senate side, doing so blocks a president from making recess appointments.

>Curiously, it was Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, a Republican, who controls the chamber's calendar. He began holding pro formas early in Mr Trump's term to block just that: recess appointments, opting to ensure his chamber would have a say in vetting potential Trump administration officials. 

A spokesman for Mr McConnell had not responded to an inquiry for comment.

>Notably, Mr Trump falsely said he had pushed over 445 federal judges through the Senate confirmation process. The real number is closer to 200.

>Meantime, Mr Trump has been panned by Democrats and some health experts about the federal government not setting up a comprehensive testing program. On Tuesday night, he tried to shift blame on testing to governors; the next night, he said ""we're not going to run a parking lot"" typically used by shoppers going to big-box retailers, for instance, ""from Washington, DC.""

>The president also partially sidestepped a question about reports US intelligence agencies have concluded the coronavirus went public via an intern at a Chinese testing facility, who infected her boyfriend – and he went to a wet market and sent it viral. But he did say ""we're hearing more and more about"" that version of events.

>No hype, just the advice and analysis you need

>Register with your social account or click here to log in

>In a comment likely to be widely renounced by economists, the US leader declared America a ""developing nation"" after complaining that China is often still considered such despite its booming economy.

Additionally, Mr Trump announced an announcement coming Thursday ""afternoon"" during yet another Covid-19 press conference: He will spell out the guidelines he wants state chiefs executive to use to craft plans for reopening their jurisdictions.

>The guidelines are part of a broader walking back of a threat he made earlier this week to issue such an order himself, insisting he has ""total"" power to do so – before backing down 24 hours later.

>Legal experts say it is as doubtful under the Constitution and existing statutes that any governor would need Mr Trump's approval to issue individual reopening orders based on the conditions in their states, which vary greatly. It also is not certain they have to craft the plans he for which he will lay out specifications.

>White House sources have not waived The Independent off the notion that Mr Trump, in a Tuesday tweet, threatened to withhold federal aid from states if their governors opted against complying with his demands or orders.

>The president briefed for under an hour on Wednesday, saying it was ""freezing"" in the Rose Garden. White House aides have made clear for years that it is Mr Trump who typically decides where he will hold events, making his early – by his standards – exit curious. The briefing was initially scheduled for the indoor and climate-controlled James Brady Briefing Room.

It relies on previously unknown mechanisms and structures for its infectiousness. It has features that make lab culturing more difficult - features that wouldnt be bioengineered. All of the evidence presented simply means that it was not created by humans, in a lab or elsewhere.

Whether the cross over event happened in a lab or at a wet market is less clear. The closest wild bat coronavirus analogue was found in bats not native to the Wuhan region. However they are kept and studied at the viral research laboratory that is about 1000 feet from the infamous wet market. There has been reporting that while SARS was researched in BSL-4 labs(very secure labs), novel bat coronaviruses and bat tissue were studied in BSL-1 and BSL-2 equivalent labs(much less secure labs).

These facts certainly suggest the possibility of a cross-over event at the Wuhan Institute of Virology. In the absence of further evidence, its not possible to know with any degree of certainty where it happened. For the scientific community, for China, and, probably, the United States, having the cross-over event happen at a wet market is a more convenient truth between two possible options."

[January 10th](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/09/who-cited-human-transmission-risk-in-january-despite-trump-claims): ""The [World Health Organization](https://www.theguardian.com/world/world-health-organization) warned the US and other countries about the risk of human-to-human transmission of Covid-19 as early as 10 January, and urged precautions even though initial Chinese studies at that point had found no clear evidence of that route of infection."" 

They didn't invent evidence which didn't exist at the time, but they clearly warned about the risk, and urged countries to take precautions.

> On January 22nd, the WHO blatantly refused to call the coronavirus an outbreak 

They declared it a public health emergency. ""Outbreak"" is a vague term, and I'd be pretty surprised if they hadn't used it well before this time, but whether they did or didn't use this word on a specific date isn't an indication that they are incompetent. 

> On February 12th, the WHO finally declared a global pandemic, causing many nations to miss a window of opportunity to prepare. 

You're really confused about this. A pandemic is when the disease is already present in multiple areas. Once a pandemic exists, it's too late to prepare - you want to prepare before something actually becomes pandemic. They'd warned a month before this (see above) that countries would need to take precautions.

Please, please think before you quoting Trump's arguments in the future. He's not an accurate source of information on this or, well, any other subject."

For the moment, WHO does not recommend any broader restrictions on  travel or trade. We recommend exit screening at airports as part of a  comprehensive set of containment measures. All countries should have in  place measures to detect cases of coronavirus, including at health  facilities. The committee has made several recommendations to prevent  the further  spread of the virus, which the Chair has described, and  which I have  accepted.

PREVENTION. That was the key advise of the WHO at that time. Hindsight is always 20/20. We see how bad it is now, and try to correlate that to an action that may have led up to it. The WHO was not that action. The action, the root, that has led to so many damn cases in the U.S. was our own government going against that prevention and not being properly prepared because of misinformation about the virus by FOX News and our own damn president.

It’s a long read but really provides valuable insight into the whole situation. It took into consideration the role WHO played during some of the previous pandemics and offered contexts to the WHO’s response this time. 

To me it just goes to show how the organisation which relies heavily on international cooperation and solidarity, with only the annual budget of a university hospital, is painfully ill-equipped to deal with a pandemic of this magnitude in this current world we live in. Considering the geopolitical obstacles the WHO constantly faces and the lack of support from almost all its member states, maybe they really did the best they could, although far from adequate.

As the WHO has been actively and openly supporting China's politics, this is a problem. WHO is in an awkward situation. A number of diseases start in China. Not all, obviously, but a good number. To be allowed any access, they must comply with the Communist Party of China's wishes. Those wishes are often political rather than epidemiological. 

If they give in, they have to toe to the Party line. If they don't give in, they lose access to early epidemiological data that is critical. As China is providing a significant amount of money, that is also a financial pressure to give up legitimacy for expediency. 

But that begs the question. What's the benefit of selling out for access, if that access means you cannot respond to a global pandemic with correct information?

A better solution would have been to give the WHO a choice. Commit to open transparency and we'll cover what China pulls, or they lose their funding from us. At the moment, we are providing funding to a health organization that is providing political cover for China, who is blaming us for COVID19. This is a hamfisted response, but it does have its legitimate concerns."

So then he went with the low tech approach of RNG (Randon Number Generator) of passing it back and forth between ferrets until he got the mutations he wanted and he created a version that could kill millions of people if it accidentally leaked out.

My question is why is this not a possible scenario being discussed.

One of those Unions I work for is the International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees (IATSE). They are the labor union responsible for representing stagehands in the concert, live entertainment, broadway, sports, TV and Film industries. WWE and AEW hires Union stagehands to help setup, run, and tear down their shows. 

As many of you know, one of the first things to happen when the Covid19 pandemic started in the states was the massive shutdown and cancellation or shut down of nearly every singe tour, broadway show, and movie/tv sets in production. Hundreds of thousands of people lost their jobs and incomes in seconds. On top of that, our job is gig based work, so filing for unemployment can be an incredible hassle and difficult process. At the moment its projected our industry wont start back up until fall of 2021 at the very worst. Its an incredibly scary situation. 

So what did IATSE do for its members? Immediately pushed for relief for not only its members, bjt everyone involved in the industry whether union brothers and sisters or not. They were one of the main Labor Unions behind the [""Congress Cares Act""](https://www.iatse.net/news/congress-passes-cares-act-providing-immediate-economic-relief-entertainment-workers) which laid out ways of helping everyone in the entertainment production industry get financial help and relief. They also allowed all its members to withdraw from their annunity accounts (retirement) without paying the 10% early withdrawal penalty fee, and have the ability to return any money back into the annunity account or other certified account (Roth IRA or another annunity account.)

They are also helping their members by covering copay medical costs for Coronavirus related bills and medical emergencies and aiding in any way they can. You dont have to be a dues paying member of IATSE to qualify for its medical insurance either, you just have to have worked sk mamy hours to automatically qualify for an annunity cap account and medical insurance.

And before anyone says ""why dont they just go get real jobs? They shouldve went to college to get a real career,"" these jobs are a combination of understanding engineering, programming, rigging, and physics to do. Many of those in the industry have went to school to study the work, I personally went to college to study lighting design and stagecraft as a theatre major with two college degrees and its led me to being a full time lighting electrician, designer, rigger and stagehand in the Baltimore, DC, CA and PA areas for 10 years. Every year I take new asses, recieve new certifications and further my studies at home, hell with all the downtime I have Im studying programming new lighting consoles in my home studio. My union has made my career possible and made sure Im taken care of.

If it wasnt for them, both my local and the national, I would be completely shit out of luck right now and would have to deal with all of this all on my own, lost and scared. My Union is doing everything they can to make sure myself and everyone else in the industry thats struggling is being taken care of. Theyre fighting for us. 

Wouldnt you want someone fighting for you? Someone who understands your position and not someone concerned with the company and its budgets and profit ratios? 

Unions fight for the workers rights."

I remember first learning about climate change in the fifth grade or so when the teacher showed us a documentary called *Earth: 2100*, and another film advocating for the salvation and preservation of harp seals (I started crying when the video showed these piece of shit hunters and poachers *beating* the seals, causing blood to splatter on the nearby ice). Hurricane Katrina was also still more or less in people's minds and many were still reeling from the sheer devastation to New Orleans. I also remember watching the Captain Planet TV show around this time, and seeing all these advertisements to ""go green"" and to recycle, and that's when I was introduced to the concept of human pollution.

I think it was around that point that I started to realize something was very wrong in the world, because at the time I couldn't necessarily understand *why* people were ignoring this existential issue, or killing adorable little animals simply for their furs. I knew climate change was a thing, obviously, but I just found our collective human negligence and ignorance, not to mention violence against the creatures of the Earth senseless and deeply depressing. 

I tried to ignore the reality by distracting myself, but eventually as high school came along, I wasn't really able to run away from the truth, especially after the BP Oil Spill in the Gulf of Mexico, and after Sandy hit the Northeast coast and totally devastated New Jersey (and caused extended power outages in my hometown). 

Now, as a young man (21), I am ostensibly far more aware of the reality of climate change, and when I do think about the end of the world, I feel a mix of despair, anger, and sadness. Despair at the fact I will likely be among the last generations of human beings on this planet (( might live until the end of the century, or I might die a little bit before), anger at the fossil fuel companies and greedy multi-billionaires who knowingly kept their businesses going despite the environmental cost, and a profound sense of sadness. Sadness that humanity will probably never achieve its full potential or rise above its baser urges, that these next few decades will see humanity reach its technological apex before the decline and collapse. 

I'm in college right now, but I've lately been wondering about what the point of even working hard to get a job might be, or if even doing anything to benefit society is worth the effort, considering **society itself** is the problem and is doomed to self-destruction once resource scarcity and the worst of climate change arrives on our doorstep. 

I still think back to that film-- *Earth: 2100* that I saw in school, and while some people even today may find it too pessimistic or alarmist, I find it eerily correct in at least some of its predictions. While the current coronavirus pandemic is nowhere near as bad as the Caspian Fever of the film. the film is correct in pointing out insect populations have been disappearing in mass droves across the world, and in the scene where Las Vegas has run out of water, we've already starting seeing cities like El Paso, Texas, switch to recycling water from desalination plants. The end of the film, where Lucy learns that a bunch of cities have become walled enclaves of rich people surrounded by poverty is honestly all too indicative of the future that is to come. Once nation-states collapse around the world, all that will be left will be  neo-feudal city-states with extreme inequality, ruled by billionaire warlords."

On 14 January the WHO made [this twee](https://twitter.com/WHO/status/1217043229427761152):

>Preliminary investigations conducted by the Chinese authorities have found no clear evidence of human-to-human transmission of the novel #coronavirus (2019-nCoV) identified in #Wuhan, #China

The same day they released [this official bulletin](https://www.who.int/csr/don/14-january-2020-novel-coronavirus-thailand/en/) regarding a Chinese citizen who brought the virus to Thailand, the first recognized exported case. I’ll quote the risk assessment:

>WHO risk assessment

>This is the first exported case of novel coronavirus from Wuhan city, China. Since the initial report of cases in Wuhan city on 31 December 2019, 41 cases have a preliminary diagnosis of 2019-nCoV infection, including 1 death in a person with severe underlying medical conditions (for more information, please see the Disease Outbreak News published on 12 January 2020 ).

>As the traveler did not report having visited the market linked to most of the other cases, it is vital that investigations continue to identify the source of infection. To date, China has not reported any cases of infection among healthcare workers or contacts of the cases. Based on the available information there is no clear evidence of human-to-human transmission. No additional cases have been detected since 3 January 2020 in China.

>Additional investigation is needed to ascertain the presence of human-to-human transmission, modes of transmission, common source of exposure and the presence of asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic cases that are undetected. It is critical to review all available information to fully understand the potential transmissibility among humans.

This shows that the possibility of human-to-human transmission was seriously considered, and the details of this case made it seem possible, which we now know occurs all too easily. There is no clear evidence of such transmission, but there was circumstantial evidence that suggested it the WHO wanted to evaluate. 

This contrasts with the [12 January notice when it was still only in China](https://www.who.int/csr/don/12-january-2020-novel-coronavirus-china/en/). Regarding transmission modes, this is all it states on possible human-to-human transmission:

> According to the preliminary epidemiological investigation, most cases worked at or were handlers and frequent visitors to the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market. The government reports that there is no clear evidence that the virus passes easily from person to person.

And later:

> More comprehensive information and ongoing investigations are also required to better understand the epidemiology, clinical picture, source, modes of transmission, and extent of infection; as well as the countermeasures implemented.

Note the shift from essentially discounting human-to-human transmission to considering it in just two days. This shows that the WHO did take the Chinese information at face value and once they had other information started to shift their tone. However, even after the tone shift in the long-form bulletin, the short tweet that more people would see appears to discount it, quoting the only part of the bulletin that suggests there isn't human-to-human transmission. 

On the WHO taking China's information at face value, it's difficult to say when the WHO should have begun questioning the Chinese data without a detailed analysis of what was known from other sources. If there was significant information available before 12-14 January, as some suggest, then they trusted China for too long. I should point out something I see often in my historical studies: often the best information available at the time is horribly inaccurate in hindsight, so to evaluate the WHO's actions one must use the information they had at the time, not what we have found out since then. 

On the tweet, I don't know whether that's down to a poor PR intern on the twitter account or a more systemic issue. Either way that is a very clear problem and the tweet was irresponsible given the WHO statement of the same day.

Edit: u/Kwajoch informed me of another tweet, [part of a chain](https://twitter.com/WHO/status/1217151178884222976), I had not yet known about. This changes my view. 

The 14 January tweet I noted above it timed 6:18 AM. However, at 1:27 PM, seven hours later, the WHO began tweeting about the Thailand case, with a similar shift to the one I noted between the two bulletins. They note Thailand informed them of the case the day before, but between time zones, evaluating the information, and informing their social media team I strongly suspect they did not know about it at the time of the 6:18 AM tweet. Until I am shown convincing evidence that the social media team DIDN'T know at the time of the 6:18 tweet (and if you have it, please share!), I no longer consider this irresponsible or indicative of a systemic issue."

This articles provides great, but disturbing, detail of the reality largely being ignored in Japan. 

> Japan's health authorities are struggling to stay on top of the outbreak.  

> Nine of Japan's 47 prefectures are close to filling all the emergency hospital beds set aside for coronavirus cases

> In a press conference on Tuesday, **Osaka Mayor Ichiro Matsui said doctors and nurses at a number of hospitals are forced to wear trash bags when they treat patients. The city has requested donations of unused raincoats.**

> ""The government has simply not been sufficiently serious about how it needs to conduct itself in times like this,"" said Noriko Hama, a professor of economics at Kyoto's Doshisha University. ""They are also realizing that businesses are being protected instead of ordinary people, but particularly businesses that form the support base of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party,"" she said.

The comments from the Osaka Mayor are shocking and revealing. I think something even more than we see in the news reports is stirring behind the scenes. The government is so closely tied to business and they may be informing business leaders of the real situation. 

All announced on the same day: Honda is going to [lend it’s cars](https://mobile.reuters.com/article/amp/idUSKCN21X1KW) to health facilities in Tokyo. Toyota is mulling doing the same. Sony is going to [manufacture ventilators](https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2020/04/15/business/corporate-business/sony-help-make-ventilators-japan-coronavirus-patients/#.Xpb-UCWRUlQ). Keidanren [secured masks](https://www3.nhk.or.jp/nhkworld/en/news/20200415_39/) from its members. Being all announced at the same time is a signal they may have been prompted by some sudden instruction to mobilize. 

Perhaps it’s go time now that the team of health experts advising the health ministry released a report saying [over 400,000 people could die](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-japan-report/japan-health-ministry-projects-400000-deaths-without-virus-containment-measures-media-idUSKCN21X0JC) among 800,000+ seriously ill. Oddly enough, the health ministry was silent. The same ministry who refused to test their own staff who boarded the Diamond Princess because it would interfere with work if they tested positive. 

> “The health ministry could not immediately confirm the report.”

Makes you wonder if it was released against their will."

Trump horribly screwed up his response to the coronavirus, both before it began (firing the pandemic preparation team in 2018), while it developed (doing little to nothing in February), and currently (most of what he's doing right now). There is absolutely zero reason for anyone to defend his response to the virus. Zero. 

The Chinese government played a key role for the virus becoming as devastating as it has, from covering it up when it began to affect Wuhan (possibly causing it to become much more severe than it could've been), to misinforming the WHO at times. Combined with some of the actions occurring currently, they deserve a significant amount of blame as well for it becoming as globally devastating as it has. 

Both things are true. It isn't one or the other. Trump and China both deserve ample blame, and (in a fair world, which sadly does not exist), both should be punished for their incompetence."

But don't hold Trump accountable for his words and his leadership because Democrats.

February 24th Trump said it was completely under control in the US but Nancy Pelosi said China Town in San Francisco.

March 2nd Trump is talking about the flu vaccine being able to have an impact on this and how a lot of exciting things are happening rapidly but Bill De Blasio wasn't taking it seriously!

Two days later Trump says people have nothing to worry about, they just get better and some get better by going to work like nothing is wrong.

But the Democrats right?"

Wonder if that's actually because they keep putting people on ventilators that shouldn't actually be on one and it's killing them...I was reading something about that recently.

**EDIT:** People immediately jumped on this and started downvoting me and implying that I'm spreading misinformation, but I'm not. Ventilators can cause scar tissue on the lungs, especially if improperly configured, and there is an emerging belief that this can cause worse outcomes in some patients. That is part of why it is supposed to be a method of last resort. When it's used for the wrong patients, damage to the lungs can easily mean worsening prognosis.

I also responded with skepticism the first time I saw this mentioned, but did the research and found out that there's actually something behind it.

I spent a lot of time looking at their championship meet results, and seeing where I would line up. Most coaches will recruit you if you are in the top 16 at their conference. In my emails to coaches, I always asked multiple questions, so that they would have something to respond to. In some cases, I had to email multiple coaches from a school multiple times to schedule a phone call. Being persistent with polite emails is really helpful. Also, I responded to every email, even the slower d3 schools. Even now, I am still getting some emails from smaller schools. As for the coronavirus issue, everyone is out of the pool right now, so maintaining fitness until the next meet is the most important thing.

We can weather it hopefully things get better and we are youngish. But I am tired of the narrative that only the super wealthy are losing out here. Everyone in our “bracket” is in the exact same position as us. And this stuff matters to me and to us a lot. Its ONE of MANY things that matter to me."

People died of poverty before and will die after the coronavirus washes over.

How many times you’ve seen someone say that the cure is worse than the disease because the economic damage, of people losing their jobs, would be worse than the impact of the virus?

It’s like they don’t even acknowledge that poverty is a huge problem even before this, but now that it is convenient to the argument, poor people now exist and should be used to defend this argument.

>The call for body bags came late Saturday.

>By Monday, the police in a small New Jersey town had gotten an anonymous tip about a body being stored in a shed outside one of the state’s largest nursing homes.

>When the police arrived, the corpse had been removed from the shed, but they discovered 17 bodies piled inside the nursing home in a small morgue intended to hold no more than four people.

>“They were just overwhelmed by the amount of people who were expiring,” said Eric C. Danielson, the police chief in Andover, a small township in Sussex County, the state’s northernmost county.

>The 17 were among 68 recent deaths linked to the long-term care facility, Andover Subacute and Rehabilitation Center I and II, including two nurses, officials said. Of those who died, 26 people had tested positive for the virus.

>For the others, the cause of death is unknown.

>Of the patients who remain at the homes, housed in two buildings, 76 have tested positive for the virus; 41 staff members, including an administrator, are sick with Covid-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus, according to county health records shared on Wednesday with a federal official.

>Andover Subacute is not alone. Coronavirus has swept through the New York region’s nursing homes with devastating and deadly speed, killing thousands of residents at facilities struggling with staff shortages, increasingly sick patients and a lack of personal protective gear.

>But with beds for 700 patients, Andover Subacute is, records show, the state’s largest licensed facility — and the risk of continued spread is terrifying to family members who have turned to social media and their local congressman, desperate for answers and extra personnel.

>“The challenge we’re having with all of these nursing homes, is once it spreads, it’s like a wildfire,” said Representative Josh Gottheimer, a Democrat who got the call on Saturday, asking for body bags. “It’s very hard to stop it.”

>One of the owners of the facility, Chaim Scheinbaum, did not return calls or emails. Staff members who answered phones at the facilities said they were not authorized to speak to the news media.

>Even before the pandemic, the nursing home had struggled. Andover Subacute and Rehabilitation II recently got a one-star rating of “much below average” from Medicare for staffing levels, inspections and patient care.

>“I feel so helpless,” one woman, who started a group for family members, wrote on Facebook on Tuesday. “I feel like everyone is going to get Covid. What do we do?”

>Staff members at the facility were asking the same thing.

>“To all the people calling into the governor’s office, the congressman’s office to help us tell them WE NEED HELP,” a representative of Andover Subacute & Rehab Center Two wrote at 7:18 p.m. on Monday, in a Facebook post that was deleted on Wednesday.

>After news began to be shared on Wednesday about the bodies found in the makeshift morgue, a discovery first reported by The New Jersey Herald, the fear intensified.

>Mr. Gottheimer said his office had fielded calls from staff members and worried relatives pleading for help. He said he had spoken to a representative of the Federal Emergency Management Agency about the possibility of sending National Guard medics.

>The state Department of Health sent two shipments containing 3,200 surgical masks, 1,400 N95 masks and 10,000 gloves to the nursing homes, said Donna Leusner, a spokeswoman. The first shipment went out about a week ago and the second should have been delivered Tuesday or Wednesday, she said.

>“It’s scary for everybody — for the residents and for the staff,” Mr. Gottheimer said. “What is surprising to me is how many are dying in house, versus the hospital.”

>The nursing home has told local health officials that they are housing sick patients on separate wings or floors, Chief Danielson said. And local residents have been gathering supplies to donate to the nursing home.

>Several women created a Facebook page and a website, Sparta Helps Healthcare Heroes, to gather needed gowns, gloves and masks.

>“At first, it was kind of like, ‘What can we do?’” said one of the organizers, LeeAnne Pitzer. “Now we have an army of sewers who are making handmade masks that can be washed and reused.”

>One resident of Sparta, Cheryl Boggs, said she found three boxes of Tyvek suits and bootees in a storage room at the company where she works, Petro-Mechanics. She dropped them off on Monday after seeing the pleas for help on Facebook.

>“We just wanted to help,” she said.

>Lily Repasch, 84, died three weeks ago at Andover Subacute and Rehabilitation Center I.

>Her son and three daughters were regular visitors to the facility, even talking through a window in her final days after the state ordered all long-term care facilities to stop allowing visitors.

>The women said the facility offered no way for them to communicate with their mother, who had dementia, and provided family members no information. Their mother was never tested for the coronavirus.

>“Her death was inevitable,” said one daughter, Lee Repasch. “But she was a vulnerable woman with dementia. It was inevitable, but it didn’t need to be like this.”

>Most of the state’s nursing homes have reported at least one case of the coronavirus, which as of Wednesday had infected 6,815 patients of long-term care facilities in New Jersey. At least 45 of the 351 coronavirus-related deaths announced on Wednesday were residents of long-term care facilities.

>Gov. Philip D. Murphy said that once the threat of the pandemic passes, New Jersey must take a hard look at what went wrong.

>“It’s pretty clear that a big weakness in the system, and in reality, is long-term care facilities,” he said.

>Thirteen of the bodies discovered on Monday at the Andover facility were moved to a refrigerated truck outside a hospital in nearby Newton, Chief Danielson said. A funeral home had made arrangements to pick up the other four.

>He said he was not entirely surprised by the number of bodies discovered.

>“I don’t know if I’m shocked by any means,” he said."

Denis Constantine, who is originally from Romania but living at Shinguan, Mile House Road in Enniscorthy, is facing two charges of contravening the provisions of a regulation under the emergency legislation signed into law last month

It is alleged he was stopped by gardaí on two occasions over the Easter weekend more than two kilometres from his home, first on Good Friday near Bunclody and again on Easter Monday morning near New Ross in Co Wexford.

**Mr Constantine is also charged with three other offences including driving without a licence or insurance while disqualified.**

The court was told he made no reply to the charges.

In Gorey District Court sitting in Wexford today, Judge Brian O Shea refused bail and remanded Denis Constantine in custody to appear again in court next Tuesday."

    Article:

Sweden’s population is roughly similar to New York City’s (actually about two million more), and in every way a case study of how one size does not fit all in the coronavirus epidemic.

Sweden is a “high trust” society, which explains why its competitive economy can coexist with an extensive welfare state. People trust each other not to abuse handouts; citizens trust their government to use tax dollars efficiently in supplying services such as housing, child care and higher education that citizens might otherwise get from the market.

A high-trust society, it turns out, also allows Swedes to get by with less government when it comes to social distancing. Sweden has banned crowds and bar service, and has tried to protect the elderly and vulnerable. But otherwise it has expected business owners and their customers to decide how best to deal with the virus.

The U.S. is low-trust society, befitting a big, diverse, rambunctious country, operating under a federalized system of government, and with a strong taste for individualism.

New York, in a sense, represents an attempt to impose high-trust government on a low-trust population. More than 40% of residents rely on Medicaid, nearly a third of whom may be ineligible on income grounds, according to a recent study. Former Mayor Mike Bloomberg might even say they further abuse the privilege by not looking after their health. (His bans of smoking, trans fats and Big Gulps were framed at the time partly as solicitude for the taxpayer.)

The cost of these “comorbidities” that so worried Mayor Bloomberg is now proving high in the coronavirus crisis. New York is also rife with another kind of diversity less found in Sweden: Some 800 languages are spoken in Queens alone; many residents live in high-risk multigenerational households. In Sweden, more than half the population lives in one-person households, the obesity rate is almost 40% less than America’s, and their cultural affinities make it more likely they will hear and heed social directives.

One size doesn’t fit all. That lesson should also guide us in seeking a way out of our nuclear-winter approach to fighting the virus. Sweden’s experiment is still unfolding. Its death tally has been ticking up, but that may reflect the fact that Sweden can permit a faster spread because its hospital capacity is holding up.

Which brings us to a key point. Don’t believe those who claim Sweden’s approach is “radical.” Sweden is following the same flatten-the-curve strategy the U.S. and other countries are pursuing, aiming to control the infection rate to manage demand on its health-care system. It’s just doing so with rather more frankness about what the existence of a “curve” implies: Most citizens can still expect to be exposed to the virus in the year or two before a vaccine might become available.

Sweden, as a result, has been readily dumped on by the kind of critics who have failed to provide their own societies with a realistic lockdown endgame. Sweden, under its Social Democratic Prime Minister Stefan Löfven, has been an easy punching bag, but the real problem is public figures elsewhere who haven’t been candid with their citizens: Even when we have much better testing, we won’t really have a way of stopping the virus while still having an economy.

It doesn’t help that many pundits, news people and politicians are in the age group that arguably needs to be protected from the virus. Naturally, they find it hard to say that others should expect to be infected. I could name a certain business-channel commentator (and you could too) who is especially tangled up in this issue since he is smart enough to know that the alternative is laying waste to America and its economy.

When it’s all over, academics will look seriously at how the lockdown strategy compares with alternative strategies (not the mythical “do nothing” strategy). They will ask how much of our apparent curve-flattening to date was due to individuals taking precautions, how much to heavy-handed government intervention. How many lives (and, more realistically, years of life) were really saved by our efforts? How much of our apparent success came from overestimating the potential burden on health care in the first place?

Our indiscriminate shutdowns may eventually seem perverse for requiring the least and most vulnerable to shoulder equally the risk of the virus’s spread. This will certainly be so if we end up admitting the virus was always destined to become an endemic and recurrent feature of the epidemiological landscape. The strategy that made some sense for America’s biggest city may have made little sense elsewhere. One thing we can be pretty sure of: Under pressure of a fast-evolving crisis, many decisions will turn out to have been fairly bad."

Granted, he’s wearing a mask, so he’s somewhat protected but should he later unknowingly touch somewhere that mucus has landed, he can share those germs with an exponentially larger group of people, especially being that he works in the customer service industry. 

I’m just saying, we all need to be much smarter and overly cautious about spreading germs. One infection, improperly contained, can create a whole host of new cases.

So if that isn't going to the WHO because they did a bad job, then who is it going to.

EDIT:  Forbes says it is $453M/year and that it would be $1.38/American"

Like, don't people only see your stuff if they either follow you or get recommended it by an algorithm? So how do you get people to follow you in the first place, do you just scream memes and nuclear takes into the void until someone out in the void listens and decides ""this is the kind of crazy I want to listen to""?

However that body certainly is not the World Health Organization (WHO) under its current leadership ""Doctor"" Tedros Ghebreyesus. 

* Since taking over the WHO, one of ""Doctor"" Tedros' first actions was to try to appoint Zimbabwean [despot](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-41702662) Robert Mugabe as a ""goodwill ambassador"".  

* Tedros has consistently [praised](https://youtu.be/yz4vfoN9oUk?t=483) China despite the fact that the Chinese Communist Party has engaged in censoring information and is behind the arrest and forced [disappearances](https://www.businessinsider.com/china-coronavirus-whistleblowers-speak-out-vanish-2020-2) of many doctors, journalists, and critics. Tedros commended China for “setting a [new standard](https://www.cfr.org/blog/who-and-china-dereliction-duty) for outbreak control” and “openness to sharing information”.
 
* Yet in China, there have been cases of doctors and journalists who have been [silenced and arrested](https://edition.cnn.com/2020/02/08/opinions/coronavirus-bociurkiw/index.html). Dr. Li Wenliang, who was one of the early senior doctors to report the outbreak was taken by the police, was forced to sign a document to stay silent about the virus. He is [now dead](https://www.businessinsider.com/china-coronavirus-whistleblowers-speak-out-vanish-2020-2).


* Information about the virus in China is still being [suppressed](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/05/chinese-social-media-censoring-officially-sanctioned-facts-on-coronavirus) by the Chinese Communist Party. The Chinese government recently put [restrictions](https://www.ibtimes.com/coronavirus-origin-cover-china-stifles-research-instructions-posted-online-deleted-2957287) on research into the origins of the coronavirus. Chinese government continues to [censor] information about the virus on Chinese internet. 

The WHO under Tedros has also made efforts to appease China with disastrous consequences: 

* WHO tends to echo and mirror China's claims on the virus. The WHO [tweeted](https://twitter.com/WHO/status/1217043229427761152) this on 14 January 2020:
 
>""Preliminary investigations conducted by the Chinese authorities have found no clear evidence of human-to-human transmission of the novel #coronavirus (2019-nCoV) identified in #Wuhan, #China🇨🇳.""

This was around the same day the Wuhan Health Commission said: 

>""The possibility of limited human-to-human [transmission](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-52294623) could not be [excluded](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2020/04/world-health-organization-blame-pandemic-coronavirus/609820/), although the risk of sustained transmission was [low](https://qz.com/1801985/the-changing-coronavirus-outbreak-narrative-pushed-by-china/)."" 

* In Geneva during WHO's annual [Executive Board](https://www.voanews.com/science-health/coronavirus-outbreak/who-chief-urges-countries-not-close-borders-foreigners-china) meeting on 3 February, WHO's Director General Tedros urged countries not to close borders on China.

* Chinese media also notes WHO chief Tedros' effusive praise for China's approach. Tedros did not recommend the evacuation of nationals claiming the power of China's system and the effectiveness of its measures are ""rarely seen in the world"" and are [""admirable.""](http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/2020-01/28/c_138739356.htm). Never mind that China [punishes](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-china-censorship/report-says-china-internet-firms-censored-coronavirus-terms-criticism-early-in-outbreak-idUSKBN20Q1VS) its citizens for reporting the virus and charges them for ""spreading rumors"" on the virus.

If Germany or any government for that matter has any integrity left they should pull support from the WHO. Or at least campaign for the investigation and removal of its leadership. 

The only thing consistent about the WHO under ""Doctor"" Tedros is that it praises governments that have no regard for human rights. Ironic how an international body meant to spearhead human health and properly inform the world actually stands by governments like China's that engage in [censorship](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2020/02/01/early-missteps-state-secrecy-china-likely-allowed-coronavirus-spread-farther-faster/) and [suppression](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2020-03-31/who-accused-of-suppressing-taiwan-coronavirus-response-data/12101512) of information and have no regard for the lives and human rights of doctors, journalists, and people who report the truth."

You didn’t lose me at the 50%. You lost me at this. Notice the lockdowns went from 2 weeks to 2 months to “better do it until there’s a vaccine!” That’s not because some random people you saw a photo of on social media went to the park. It’s because the lockdown narrative has gone from “flatten the curve” to “stop every single case.” Here in NY we’ve flattened the curve, yet I see people pushing for MORE restrictions. 

And yeah, we get through things by working together. But I don’t see anyone “working” for those of us whose mental health is suffering (linking meditation apps and saying “we’re all in this together!!!” is so coddling that it’s offensive). No one gives a shit if someone is suicidal, but if they say they have the sniffles from coronavirus it becomes national news. 

What’s the mortality rate for those who lose their jobs and aren’t helped by a measly $1,200? Those who commit suicide because they’ve been cut off from society (video chats don’t fucking count)? Those who now can’t get *other* medical care because general healthcare isn’t considered to be essential?

And before you say “well yeah, if the hospitals are overwhelmed, you can’t get that general healthcare either!” then take note of how many healthcare facilities are being closed and how many practitioners are being furloughed *because* patients can’t go in for treatment. My therapist office may end up closing permanently because most patients have cancelled video sessions (because video sessions suck and are a joke on top of what is already a joke of a mental healthcare option, but I digress) and they’ve already lost hundreds of thousands of dollars.

“But millions of people could die.” Yes, and millions will die from other ways. Our healthcare system is a joke, and so is everything else in this country. That’s not something that can be changed with the flip of a switch. People will die no matter what we do. 

People (most of us) here aren’t advocating that we open up raves and 100,000+ people events. They’re (rightfully) questioning whether calling for a mass lockdown without considering literally *anything other than the virus* is the right option to take. Your little speech on “togetherness” is bullshit if *all* you care about is the virus."

>“When somebody is the president of the United States, the authority is total. And that’s the way it’s got to be. It’s total,” he said.

>On Tuesday, Mr Trump backtracked: “I’m not putting any pressure on the governors,” he said, before adding that “we’ll open it (the country) in beautiful little pieces.”

>“I think that there’s hypocrisy here in that, one, if President Obama had said those words that you heard from President Trump, that the authority is total with the presidency, conservatives’ heads would’ve exploded across the board,” he said.

>“But now, it’s ‘no he cant open up’.”

>Mr Baier believes that Mr Trump’s comments have a big effect nationwide, and told viewers that “the bottom line is that the president can really influence these governors and work with them.”

>He added that “as far as the top-down order, by the Constitution, you can’t do that. So it’s working with these governors to open it up in a rolling kind of open is what I imagine would happen.”

> Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) and House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) have insisted that Congress spend another $250 billion on small businesses devastated by the pandemic, but they refuse to “renegotiate unrelated programs” from last month’s emergency coronavirus bill.
> 
> What are they afraid of?
> 
> Well, maybe it’s this: As the dust settles on the $2.2 trillion legislation, it has become clear that one of its largest provisions, a $170 billion tax giveaway, appears to be tailor-made for the benefit of wealthy real estate investors such as President Trump and his son-in-law, Jared Kushner, who is running one of Trump’s coronavirus task forces.
> 
> The giveaway, primarily to real estate investors and hedge funds, is larger than the total amount in the legislation for hospitals ($100 billion) and for relief for all state and local governments ($150 billion). Worse, the bonanza for these millionaires and billionaires has little to do with the coronavirus: It lets them offset losses not just from 2020 but from 2018 and 2019, before the pandemic.
> 
> This is repugnant. Cash-strapped states don’t have the funds to care for the sick, much less to do the testing, contact tracing and isolation needed to reopen workplaces and schools. As The Post’s Tony Romm reported Tuesday, more than 2,100 U.S. cities expect major budget shortfalls — and therefore possible cuts to vital public services.
> 
> But this provision gives tax filers who earn more than $1 million a year an average windfall of $1.6 million this year alone. (Compare that with the $1,200 break the average wage earner gets.) As The Post’s Jeff Stein reported Tuesday, the Joint Committee on Taxation found that 82 percent of the benefit of this and another tax giveaway in the coronavirus relief bill will go to the 43,000 taxpayers who earn more than $1 million — and just 3 percent to those who earn less than $100,000.
> 
> Of course, we don’t know for sure how Trump could benefit. As you may have heard, he won’t release his tax returns. But we know that the Trump Organization includes hundreds of “pass-through” entities, the type of corporate structure that benefits from the new tax break. We also know that Kushner and his wife, Ivanka Trump, have been involved in hundreds of such entities. The windfall is particularly of use to pass-through businesses that lost money in 2018 and 2019 — when the economy was booming but many Trump properties had declining revenue because of Trump’s radioactivity.
> 
> The president has used his official position to benefit his businesses before, sending large amounts of federal government business to his properties in Florida, D.C., New York, New Jersey, Ireland and Britain, and even proposing to host the leaders of the Group ofSeven countries at his Doral resort. At least one of his properties appeared to have advance knowledge of his initial plans to reopen the economy by Easter.
> 
> Democrats insisted on a provision in the legislation to stop Trump and his family from being awarded money from a coronavirus relief fund that the administration hands out with little oversight. But the president is free to benefit from the tax break in the package, negotiated by Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin with congressional leaders, for pass-throughs (which are taxed via the individual income of their owners rather than in the form of corporate income taxes).
> 
> Real estate developers, a major component of pass-through businesses, received $67 billion in tax breaks in the 2017 Trump tax cuts, partially offset by new limits on the losses that could be deducted. The new law gets rid of the limits — a conservative goal for the past few years.
> 
> Democrats said they were aware of the provision, which first appeared in a draft of the bill by Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa), the chairman of the Finance Committee, but they weren’t aware of the huge price tag until too late in the process to do anything about it. The Joint Committee on Taxation’s estimate of the cost came out a day after the Senate unanimously passed the bill.
> 
> Joe Biden, the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, has called for repealing the tax break to fund student-debt relief. Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.) and Rep.

2020-04-15,lovememychem,COVID19,29,https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/g1hpwu/ending_coronavirus_lockdowns_will_be_a_dangerous/fngg62w/,"Between February and March 16, our testing was so limited that severe cases were vastly overrepresented in the pool of testing capabilities, which would skew towards higher hospitalization rates.

I’m sure there’s better sources out there that have an even more precisely-targeted discussion of this point, but just some quick searching found this: https://www.statista.com/statistics/1105061/coronavirus-deaths-by-region-in-italy/

https://www.statista.com/statistics/1106372/coronavirus-death-rate-by-age-group-italy/

At the time of that analysis, there were 18,641 confirmed deaths due to COVID-19 in Italy. Of those 18,641 patients that died, only 47 were under the age of 40. Only 217 were under the age of 50. Fewer than 1000 were under the age of 60.

And bear in mind — parts of Italy were absolutely hammered and in those areas, their hospitals were absolutely slammed. And also bear in mind that Italy also doesn’t have the resources to test everyone — they’re still prioritizing the most serious cases, and mild infections aren’t getting picked up nearly as frequently, so the data will still be more heavily skewed towards overestimating mortality.

And even with all those effects, Italy still had very very low death rates in the younger populations — and I’m willing to bet many of the deceased had serious predisposing conditions.

I realize that doesn’t directly answer your question about hospitalization rates, but hopefully that’s a reasonable enough proxy until someone has some better data than I could scrounge up right before bed :)"
2020-04-15,TribRetiree,worldnews,29,https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/g1j3dr/un_chief_says_not_the_time_to_reduce_who/fnggvfy/,"Copied from /u/electric_screams from [another post](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/g1fcav/trump_to_halt_who_funding_amid_review/fnfli79?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x), it's a very well-researched timeline that I think more people should see because there's a **lot** of exaggerated, anti-WHO bandwagoning going on.  I also just want to add [that only 18 nations](https://worldpopulationreview.com/countries/countries-that-recognize-taiwan) recognize Taiwan as a country, which means that at least 90% of UN states, including the permanent members on the Security Council, do not - this means, if the WHO were to take a political stance, not only would it be acting against its mandate, but also in opposition of the official stances of the US, the UK, France, Germany, Canada, Australia, etc. Personally I think this is a great shame, but I also think it's ridiculous/ill-advised to expect health agencies to be leading a political movement against almost every country.

I also don't think the WHO is blameless. But they did more than you might think, and certainly more than the average government. They're just toothless in forcing governments to comply, which isn't necessarily a bad thing.

If the takeaway from this whole affair is ""The UN is garbage and global cooperation is a futile hoax"" that would be a shame indeed.

\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

(To note, as part of this timeline, the WHO released the international community's Strategic Preparedness and Response Plan on 3 February which outlines in its first pillar that:

""National public health emergency management mechanisms should be activated with engagement of relevant ministries such as health, education, travel and tourism, public works, environment, social protection, and agriculture, to provide coordinated management of COVID-19 preparedness and response.""

The US declared a state of emergency on March 12.

Really the entire document is a fantastic read about how countries should prepare themselves for this disease. Should the US, or any country, have read this document and complied with the directions presented, this whole pandemic could have been minimised considerably.

But it's far easier to blame the WHO for our leaders shortcomings... cause we failed to look into this deep enough.)

**31 Dec 2019**

China reported [a cluster of cases of pneumonia](https://www.who.int/csr/don/05-january-2020-pneumonia-of-unkown-cause-china/en/) in Wuhan, Hubei Province. A novel coronavirus was eventually identified.

**1 January 2020**

WHO had set up the IMST (Incident Management Support Team) across the three levels of the organization: headquarters, regional headquarters and country level, putting the organization on an emergency footing for dealing with the outbreak.

**4  January 2020**

WHO [reported on social media](https://twitter.com/WHO/status/1213523866703814656?s=20) that there was a cluster of pneumonia cases – with no deaths – in Wuhan, Hubei province. 

**5 January 2020**

WHO published our [first Disease Outbreak News](https://www.who.int/csr/don/05-january-2020-pneumonia-of-unkown-cause-china/en/) on the new virus. This is a flagship technical publication to the scientific and public health community as well as global media. It contained a risk assessment and advice, and reported on what China had told the organization about the status of patients and the public health response on the cluster of pneumonia cases in Wuhan.

**10 January 2020**

WHO issued a comprehensive package of technical guidance online with advice to all countries on how to detect, test and manage potential cases, based on what was known about the virus at the time. This guidance was shared with WHO's regional emergency directors to share with WHO representatives in countries. 

Based on experience with SARS and MERS and known modes of transmission of respiratory viruses, infection and prevention control guidance were published to protect health workers recommending droplet and contact precautions when caring for patients, and airborne precautions for aerosol generating procedures conducted by health workers.

**12 January 2020**

China publicly [shared](https://www.who.int/csr/don/12-january-2020-novel-coronavirus-china/en/) the genetic sequence of COVID-19. 

**13 January 2020**

Officials confirm a case of [COVID-19 in Thailand](https://www.who.int/news-room/detail/13-01-2020-who-statement-on-novel-coronavirus-in-thailand), the first recorded case outside of China.  

**14 January 2020**

As pointed out, the WHO tweeted "" Preliminary investigations conducted by the Chinese authorities have found no clear evidence of human-to-human transmission of the novel [\#coronavirus](https://twitter.com/hashtag/coronavirus?src=hashtag_click) (2019-nCoV) identified in [\#Wuhan](https://twitter.com/hashtag/Wuhan?src=hashtag_click), [\#China](https://twitter.com/hashtag/China?src=hashtag_click)."" Meanwhile, the first case of COVID outside of China was on January 13th, in Thailand - hence why research was mainly focused on China, because there weren't cases elsewhere. Admittedly, if China were lying, it could've been more forceful about getting information. But 1) that's China's fault more than the WHO's and 2) if the WHO had tried to strongarm China, it could've just as easily been forced out and we have no ground-zero data at all.

WHO's technical lead for the response noted in a press briefing there may have been limited human-to-human transmission of the coronavirus (in the 41 confirmed cases), mainly through family members, and that there was a risk of a possible wider outbreak. The lead also said that human-to-human transmission would not be surprising given our experience with SARS, MERS and other respiratory pathogens.  

**20-21 January 2020**

WHO experts from its China and Western Pacific regional offices conducted a brief field visit to Wuhan.

**22 January 2020**

WHO mission to China issued a [statement](https://www.who.int/china/news/detail/22-01-2020-field-visit-wuhan-china-jan-2020) saying that there was evidence of human-to-human transmission in Wuhan but more investigation was needed to understand the full extent of transmission.

**22- 23 January 2020**

The WHO Director- General [convened](https://www.who.int/news-room/detail/23-01-2020-statement-on-the-meeting-of-the-international-health-regulations-(2005)-emergency-committee-regarding-the-outbreak-of-novel-coronavirus-(2019-ncov)) an Emergency Committee (EC) under the International Health Regulations (IHR 2005) to assess whether the outbreak constituted a public health emergency of international concern. The independent members from around the world could not reach a consensus based on the evidence available at the time. They asked to be reconvened within 10 days after receiving more information.

**28 January 2020**

A senior WHO delegation led by the Director-General [travelled to Beijing to meet China’s leadership](https://www.who.int/news-room/detail/28-01-2020-who-china-leaders-discuss-next-steps-in-battle-against-coronavirus-outbreak), learn more about China’s response, and to offer any technical assistance. 

While in Beijing, Dr. Tedros agreed with Chinese government leaders that an international team of leading scientists would travel to China on a mission to better understand the context, the overall response, and exchange information and experience.

**30 January 2020**

The WHO Director-General reconvened the Emergency Committee (EC). This was earlier than the 10-day period and only two days after the first reports of limited human-to-human transmission were reported outside China. This time, the EC reached consensus and advised the Director-General that the outbreak constituted a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC). The Director-General accepted the recommendation and declared the novel coronavirus outbreak (2019-nCoV) a PHEIC. This is the 6th time WHO has declared a PHEIC since the International Health Regulations (IHR) came into force in 2005.

**3 February 2020**

WHO releases the international community's [Strategic Preparedness and Response Plan](https://www.who.int/publications-detail/strategic-preparedness-and-response-plan-for-the-new-coronavirus) to help protect states with weaker health systems. 

**11-12 February 2020**

WHO convened a [Research and Innovation Forum](https://www.who.int/news-room/detail/12-02-2020-world-experts-and-funders-set-priorities-for-covid-19-research) on COVID-19, attended by more than 400 experts and funders from around the world, which included presentations by George Gao, Director General of China CDC, and Zunyou Wu, China CDC's chief epidemiologist. 

**16-24 February 2020**

The WHO-China Joint mission, which included experts from Canada, Germany, Japan, Nigeria, Republic of Korea, Russia, Singapore and the US (CDC, NIH) spent time in Beijing and also travelled to Wuhan and two other cities. They spoke with health officials, scientists and health workers in health facilities (maintaining physical distancing). The report of the joint mission can be found here: [https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/who-china-joint-mission-on-covid-19-final-report.pdf](https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/who-china-joint-mission-on-covid-19-final-report.pdf?sfvrsn=fce87f4e_2)"

If anyone is seeing the same BS about “we don’t know if antibodies mean that a person is immune to coronavirus!” keep these things in mind:

• if there was NO immunity to CV - how on earth would a vaccine work? 🤔

• most experts say you *more than likely* cannot contract the virus again within weeks or months - you are at least immune for a season, possibly up to 5 years - https://www.businessinsider.com/can-you-get-covid19-twice-experts-think-not-right-away-2020-4

• “There is some recent, hopeful evidence that SARS-CoV-2 triggers the production of the neutralizing antibodies, Walt said. For example, blood-plasma transfusions from people who have recovered from the novel coronavirus at least appear to have a positive impact on Covid-19 patients in critical condition. Many hospitals have begun employing this treatment, and studies of it are underway.” https://www.bloomberg.com/amp/news/articles/2020-04-14/do-coronavirus-survivors-have-immunity-from-reinfection-maybe

The cold war started years ago. Americans just have no idea because this time around the opponent essentially owns or can play both countries' media. 

They [simultaneously](https://youtu.be/KQaNdTKQyLY?t=342) stripped the west's PPE, while begging for donations, while selling them back defective [masks](https://www.scmp.com/news/china/diplomacy/article/3077428/netherlands-recalls-600000-face-masks-china-due-low-quality) and [tests](https://twitter.com/JackBMontgomery/status/1243920592199462913), while hiding a virus, while locking down Wuhan *except* international flights out, while blaming and now openly persecuting foreigners, while playing victim about xenophobia, while playing our retarded MSM to the point half our population is hating on and calling *ourselves* the racists. It's fucking insane. 

Trump has actually done a good job protecting high tech [national security firms](https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2018-12-06/huawei-bust-signals-the-real-u-s-trade-war-with-china) from being bought out. We need to do expand this, *especially* to media. Otherwise we don't have a country. 

The idea of stopping ""foreign election interference"" when your media gravels to foreign nations is naive. The CCP owns the biggest DNC donor and [frontrunner](https://nypost.com/2019/05/11/the-troubling-reason-why-biden-is-so-soft-on-china/). Without an independent media half this country still actually believes a country with the economic power of [Italy](https://countryeconomy.com/countries/compare/russia/italy) is the *true* global bogeyman.

The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation gave two grants to The Pirbright Institute, a research outfit located in Surry, England. Pirbright owns a patent on a weakened strain of coronavirus, which they bought so no corporation could patent it and lock it away from being researched. The goal is to use it for research in preventing infection in birds (like chickens and other livestock).

One, this is not the same coronavirus as COVID-19, and two, Bill Gates has nothing to do with it beyond the grants. The conspiracy morons don't care about those facts, and they claim Gates patented the novel coronavirus so he could profit from an eventual vaccine (or worse).

The fact that his foundation funds vaccine efforts across the globe also makes him a hate-target for conspiranauts because they still think vaccines are poison, used to give you nanobots, or whatever nonsense they've decided is true today. So if you're involved in vaccination, you're the devil to the ignorant and delusional. The COVID-19 pandemic and intentionally lying about The Pirbright Institute means that Gates is now a cabal mastermind or something.

tl;dr Their fantasy story is that Gates is an evil vaccine man."

31 Dec 2019

China reported a cluster of cases of pneumonia in Wuhan, Hubei Province. A novel coronavirus was eventually identified.

1 January 2020

WHO had set up the IMST (Incident Management Support Team) across the three levels of the organization: headquarters, regional headquarters and country level, putting the organization on an emergency footing for dealing with the outbreak.

4  January 2020

WHO reported on social media that there was a cluster of pneumonia cases – with no deaths – in Wuhan, Hubei province. 

5 January 2020

WHO published our first Disease Outbreak News on the new virus. This is a flagship technical publication to the scientific and public health community as well as global media. It contained a risk assessment and advice, and reported on what China had told the organization about the status of patients and the public health response on the cluster of pneumonia cases in Wuhan.

10 January 2020

WHO issued a comprehensive package of technical guidance online with advice to all countries on how to detect, test and manage potential cases, based on what was known about the virus at the time. This guidance was shared with WHO's regional emergency directors to share with WHO representatives in countries. 

Based on experience with SARS and MERS and known modes of transmission of respiratory viruses, infection and prevention control guidance were published to protect health workers recommending droplet and contact precautions when caring for patients, and airborne precautions for aerosol generating procedures conducted by health workers.

12 January 2020

China publicly shared the genetic sequence of COVID-19. 

13 January 2020

Officials confirm a case of COVID-19 in Thailand, the first recorded case outside of China.  

14 January 2020

WHO's technical lead for the response noted in a press briefing there may have been limited human-to-human transmission of the coronavirus (in the 41 confirmed cases), mainly through family members, and that there was a risk of a possible wider outbreak. The lead also said that human-to-human transmission would not be surprising given our experience with SARS, MERS and other respiratory pathogens.  

20-21 January 2020

WHO experts from its China and Western Pacific regional offices conducted a brief field visit to Wuhan.

22 January 2020

WHO mission to China issued a statement saying that there was evidence of human-to-human transmission in Wuhan but more investigation was needed to understand the full extent of transmission.

22- 23 January 2020

The WHO Director- General convened-emergency-committee-regarding-the-outbreak-of-novel-coronavirus-(2019-ncov)) an Emergency Committee (EC) under the International Health Regulations (IHR 2005) to assess whether the outbreak constituted a public health emergency of international concern. The independent members from around the world could not reach a consensus based on the evidence available at the time. They asked to be reconvened within 10 days after receiving more information.

28 January 2020

A senior WHO delegation led by the Director-General travelled to Beijing to meet China’s leadership, learn more about China’s response, and to offer any technical assistance. 

While in Beijing, Dr. Tedros agreed with Chinese government leaders that an international team of leading scientists would travel to China on a mission to better understand the context, the overall response, and exchange information and experience.

30 January 2020

The WHO Director-General reconvened the Emergency Committee (EC). This was earlier than the 10-day period and only two days after the first reports of limited human-to-human transmission were reported outside China. This time, the EC reached consensus and advised the Director-General that the outbreak constituted a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC). The Director-General accepted the recommendation and declared the novel coronavirus outbreak (2019-nCoV) a PHEIC. This is the 6th time WHO has declared a PHEIC since the International Health Regulations (IHR) came into force in 2005.

3 February 2020 

WHO releases the international community's Strategic Preparedness and Response Plan to help protect states with weaker health systems. 

11-12 February 2020

WHO convened a Research and Innovation Forum on COVID-19, attended by more than 400 experts and funders from around the world, which included presentations by George Gao, Director General of China CDC, and Zunyou Wu, China CDC's chief epidemiologist. 

16-24 February 2020

The WHO-China Joint mission, which included experts from Canada, Germany, Japan, Nigeria, Republic of Korea, Russia, Singapore and the US (CDC, NIH) spent time in Beijing and also travelled to Wuhan and two other cities. They spoke with health officials, scientists and health workers in health facilities (maintaining physical distancing).

The McMahons are long time friends of Donald Trump, they’ve donated money to his sham foundation, they donated to his campaign and Linda was given a role in the Trump Administration, Linda runs a pro Trump Super-Pac that donated money to Governor DeSantis who is a staunch Trump supporter and then sporting events get deemed essential? This seems like a huge conflict of interest.

So basically someone like Sarah Logan who wrestled on Monday was an essential worker but today she’s inessential? Well that seems like a prime example of hypocrisy."

I think the schools realized there will be little difference between international students and domestic students in ability to attend classes in-person this fall. If embassy is still closed, likely the universities will still be closed as well, so there is no reason to give deferral options for international students while forcing domestic students choose between attending online and relinquishing his/her spot.

I am international admit and deeply disappointed myself, but after many thoughts I do not see any reason why I should be given preferential treatment on deferral compared to domestic students, while giving deferral to everyone will make this incoming class empty + significantly drop in quality + making next class overcrowded and almost impossible for new applicants to gain admissions on.

In the event of the 250+ people gathering ban due to the coronavirus, the prof told us to come into lecture anyways because total number of people registered for that section wasn't over 250. When we showed up, there was clearly more than 250 people since the section was so full that people had to stand in the back during lecture.

And then with Midterm 2. The whole ""marks will not be higher than MyMathLab mark"" statement while also knowing MyMathLab tends to say the correct answer is incorrect is really worrying. Why were we even required to submit our calculations to support our answers, when we weren't even going to get partial marks for it? It's like this for our final as well.

Now with Gateway 3. 30 minutes before the Gateway test's deadline, we get an email from the prof saying that the deadline for the is extended by 24 hours. Note that the Gateway test is 30 minutes long. So the people that didn't do the test are given a second chance, while those who already did it cannot do it again. After emailing the prof about this unfairness, we were told to basically fuck off.

An example of this was received by a classmate:

>*Second attempt would be viewed as unfair to all students who have exam tomorrow, or the day after. So you see that your proposal can and will be viewed as unfair.*

So had China acted *6 days* before, all of this would've been avoided, right?

Let's say it wasn't China, let's say it was any other country, the US for instance!

Let's say they knew there was a problem in November, and took action then, it would've been great, right? But what if, hear me out, they actually waited 3 months and a half before they did anything, and instead blamed another country for waiting 1/20 of the time they waited before acting, a country like China for instance, would you think it's a good excuse?

China was the first to be affected by the virus. They didn't know that this virus existed, and assumed it was pneumonia. When the volume of cases was becoming very large, they figured something was wrong, and told the WHO, which in turn informed the world. They even sequenced the virus' genome in 2019 (hence the name, coronavirus disease 2019, COVID-19).

Hindsight is 20/20 for sure, but let's not act as if the US or any other country would've done better. China is just a convenient scapegoat for the failures of the rest of the world."

There were only three confirmed cases of SARS-Cov-2 infections in Italy at that point and no major sporting events had been canceled. Eleven days later, the Lombardy region where the match took place [had become the epicenter of Italy's outbreak](https://images2.corriereobjects.it/methode_image/2020/03/01/Salute/Foto%20Salute%20-%20Trattate/ccccccbvv-kjnB-U3170761352051UEE-656x492@Corriere-Web-Sezioni.JPG). Of the 1,694 confirmed cases in Italy as of March 1st, [58.1% were concentrated in Lombardy](https://www.corriere.it/salute/malattie_infettive/20_marzo_01/coronavirus-italia-positivi-sono-1577-34-morti-83-guariti-dati-1-marzo-215bf998-5be0-11ea-ae74-e93752023e91.shtml) while another 35.2% were located in the four connecting provinces. By April 13th, at least twenty thousand people had died from COVID-19 in Italy with [53.3% of those deaths occurring in the Lombardy region](https://www.statista.com/statistics/1099389/coronavirus-deaths-by-region-in-italy/) and another 26.0% occurring in the neighboring provinces. 

Valencia, the Spanish club whose team and twenty five hundred supporters traveled to Milan for that match on February 19th, ended up having [35% of its players and staff test positive for SARS-CoV-2](https://www.espn.com/soccer/spanish-primera-division/story/4075442/valencia-say-35-percent-of-squadstaff-tested-positive-for-coronavirus). A Spanish sportswriter and some of the fans who had traveled to Italy for the match also [tested positive and were taken for medical treatment on February 27th](https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2879998-valencia-journalist-tells-story-of-contracting-coronavirus-while-covering-ucl). The return leg between Valencia and Atalanta was held in the Mestalla on March 10th, but [it was played without fans in attendance](https://www.goal.com/en/news/valencia-atalanta-behind-closed-doors-coronavirus/1hcblq7ujlanp1ohbg1hytblbu), and as a result the region of Valencia did not experience the same kind of disproportionate infection or deaths rates as Lombardy in Italy. 

I certainly hope that there is a college football season in the fall, but the fallout from that Champions League match in February demonstrates conclusively that any attempt to hold sporting events with large crowds in the absence of a vaccine would put many lives at risk, as so many people in such close proximity is the perfect environment for rapid spread. Temperature checks at the gates wouldn't be reliable enough to allow entry, while even the fastest SARS-CoV-2 tests currently take at least 45 minutes to process. Some people are hopeful for herd immunity protection, but it remains to be seen how long SARS-CoV-2 antibodies persist. Influenza antibodies last about six months, at which point you can be infected again by the same strain, while you may be infected by a different influenza strain at any point. Long story short, there is simply no viable means of managing the risk of large gatherings until a workable vaccine is approved for the general public, and that won't happen until 2021 at the earliest."

&#x200B;

 

The number of people who died from coronavirus infection in France jumped by 1,438 or 9.1% to 17,167 in the biggest single-day **increase as a number of nursing homes reported cumulative tolls following the three-day Easter weekend, the health ministry said on Wednesday.**

The number of people who died in hospitals rose by **514 or 5% to 10,643, less than the 541 reported on Tuesday**, but the cumulative death toll in nursing homes rose by 924 or 17% to 6,524, compared with 221 on Tuesday.

&#x200B;

So, essentially, a bunch of nursing home didn't report death stats over the long weekend until today. All of those deaths got piled up onto one day, giving an artificially high single day number. If you spread those 900 nursing home deaths over the three weekend days and today, you end up with death tolls from friday to wednesday of:

*  **Friday:** 987
* **Saturday:** 866
* **Sunday:** 792
* **Monday:** 805
* **Tuesday:** 762
* **Wednesday:** 745

Nothing to be particularly alarmed with about that trajectory. Gives the impression of daily deaths being stable or slightly dropping."

Medicine is chemistry, not common sense. There are situations where a person's race results in worse medical care that aren't even human prejudice. For example: one of the key early signs of Lyme disease is a rash. This rash is very prominent in light-skinned people. For dark-skinned people, the rash can be harder or impossible to detect. So dark-skinned people tend to be misdiagnosed in the early phases, since the symptom doctors are trained to use for that diagnosis is not as detectable. Nobody noticed that problem in diagnostic procedure until someone asked, ""Why do people of these races face such aberrant rates of severe infections?"" 

So if Coronavirus is affecting some race or other demographic more, there are questions to ask. Some of the explanations everyone's no doubt considering are true, but if we roll our eyes and just assume ""race is never important"" people face worse care for no reason other than ""I don't want to think about race because I assume any discussion about it is political."""

January 10th they warned there could be human to human spread.

Comparing the risks of driving a car to the risk posed by coronavirus is a false equivalency that distracts from the reality of the situation.

Yes, we drive cars and that is a risky activity. However, we have laws mandating speed limits, seat belt usage, car safety regulations, car insurance, driving tests and licensing procedures/standards, and laws that outline how someone's ability to drive can be taken away if that person has demonstrated that their driving puts others at risk.

The coronavirus puts other people at risk. Especially because of the lack of testing and asymptomatic carriers, that risk cannot be effectively assessed and so those risks cannot be effectively mitigated (similar to how DUI laws mitigate the risk of drunk drivers on the road or how seatbelts mitigate the risk of injury). Further, you cannot know for sure, unless you have already had the coronavirus and recovered (and if reinfection is not a possibility) that you do not have the coronavirus. So, unlike driving a car where you are aware of the risks involved, there is no way to assess the risk you pose to others."

Also to OP, I’m so so sorry for your loss. Your mom is and always will be a hero and forever will be remembered as such. 

When Liam St. John entered his mother’s hospital room in head-to-toe protective gear, his instincts as a nurse took over. He surveyed the accouterments of her medical care, the drips and the IV and the ventilator, and carefully read over the monitors showing her vital signs. It all seemed clinical, familiar.

But when the goodbyes began, with him dialing in loved ones on a cellphone in a plastic bag, and playing recorded messages from his two kids in hopes their grandmother would somehow hear, all his medical training fell away, he said, and “a very different feeling” took hold.

“Then you’re a scared kid who’s worried about losing his mom,” St. John said Monday, two days after his mother, Evelyn Caro, also a nurse, succumbed to the ravages of the coronavirus. “It’s just like a light switch, where it just really becomes real all of a sudden that you’re going to be saying goodbye.”

St. John is still trying to wrap his head around what happened, since it all happened so fast. He keeps having a dream in which his mother is trying to tell him something, but he can’t make it out over the din of the hospital. He’s mulling the role of health care workers like the two of them in this pandemic, recalling her pride whenever they chatted about their shared profession.

He hopes sharing her story will help others avoid a similar fate, and get them to see nurses less as heroes and more as the most vulnerable among us — as reflected by a U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimate Tuesday that healthcare workers account for 10% to 20% of all coronavirus cases in the country.

“It’s a nightmare, and it’s so fast, and it’s so aggressive,” he said of the illness caused by the virus. “This is not something I ever want anyone to go through. But if we don’t take this seriously, if we don’t limit ourselves, if we become selfish and just thumb our nose at this thing, it’s going to have some drastic consequences for people, and it’s going to be someone else’s mom, someone else’s sister, someone else’s grandmother.”

St. John never thought it would be his mother, until it was.

Caro, 69, was the life of the party, a tough but loving grandmother who was born in the Bronx to strict Puerto Rican parents and who had wanted to be a nurse ever since she left New York City for the U.S. Navy at 19, said her son and her only sister, Patricia Caro.

Even after she got pregnant, left the military and had three sons, whom she would go on to raise as a single mother, she ""never let go of that dream,” St. John said.

Through many tough years, when the family relied on public assistance, she always worked hard, her son said. She labored at a string of low-paying jobs, including in the medical field, before she finally caught her big break: a program for Holy Cross Hospital employees to go back to school for nursing.

She took the leap, and finally realized her dream of being a registered nurse at the age of 50. By last month, Caro had been in the field for 19 years, and was working part time at a gynecology practice near Holy Cross in Silver Spring — which has one of the highest concentrations of coronavirus cases in the state.

Ten days after feeling a slight fever, she was on her death bed at Johns Hopkins Hospital, intubated and depleted. On Saturday, with her lungs destroyed and her strength gone, St. John made the decision along with other family members, and in consultation with her physicians, to take her off the various machines keeping her alive.

“She looked like a shell of a person, and not the vibrant, beautiful woman that she is. That’s not how I want to remember my mom,” he said.

Before the virus, Caro spoke her mind, and doted on her two chihuahuas — Dulce and Bori, short for “boricua"" — at her home in Jessup. She had a habit of tossing things, anything, big things, on top of her head to make her grandchildren laugh. She would always go to the beauty parlor on Saturdays to have her hair and nails done, and was always in church on Sunday.

She and St. John would often sit and chat over café con leche — always Café Bustelo — in her kitchen, their work a constant source of camaraderie.

“She and I could talk to each other as mother and son and as professional colleagues. She loved that,” said St. John, who works at a Baltimore hospital and lives in Columbia. “Being a nurse defined her. And unfortunately, being a nurse is what killed her, too.”

“Being a nurse defined her. And unfortunately, being a nurse is what killed her, too.”

St. John believes his mother contracted the coronavirus at the practice where she worked and was still going in two days a week. On March 18, she texted him: “Hey sweetie! My colleague is still under the weather! I’m going in tomorrow.”

On March 26, the low-grade fever began. He texted, asking her if she had any shortness of breath. “Not to worry! I think it’s my allergies,"" she said.

On March 27, she was tested for the coronavirus at a drive-through testing facility, but “the doctors kept telling her, ‘Keep an eye on things, and pushing fluids, and try to soldier through,’” St. John said. “We didn’t really think that this was going to be COVID, because you never do think it’s going to happen to your family.""

Over the next several days, her temperature would spike and fall, her condition worsening and ebbing.

“Sometimes she would be feeling better, she would be on the phone with us telling us, ‘Oh it’s not that bad.’ Other times she was telling us she was afraid to move, or so sore she couldn’t get out of bed or change her sheets,” St. John said.

On March 30, Caro texted her son again: “I’m scared! I’m hurtin really badly.""

On April 1, she told her son she was having trouble breathing, and that, on the little device he’d bought her to test the oxygen levels in her blood, the readings were startlingly low. He told her to call 911.

“My last words to my mom were, ‘Just calm down, I’m on my way.’”

By the time he got there, the paramedics were outside, taking off their protective gear, he said. “They had her in the ambulance, but I couldn’t open the door to see her,"" he said.

Caro was put on a ventilator that day, existing in a twilight sleep or an even deeper anesthetized state for days as doctors, first at Howard County General Hospital and then at Johns Hopkins Hospital, tried all they could to save her. St. John said Caro had Type II diabetes and was overweight, which complicated her treatment, worked against the ventilator and undercut her recovery.

On Saturday, St. John and his sister-in-law Jennifer Buckle, who is also training to be a nurse, were allowed into Caro’s room to say their last goodbyes — a final mercy after a week of forced distancing.

They called Caro’s sister, Patricia, who was at home in Connecticut, distraught that she couldn’t be there for her only sister, the one who shared her voice and sense of humor, for whom she could never do any wrong.

“I told her that I loved her, that I would honor her and her memory. I would continue being there for the kids. And I apologized to her that I couldn’t be with her there, but that I loved her, and that it was OK, she could let go, because we were going to be OK. We were going to be OK,” Patricia Caro recalled through tears. “This is a horrible, horrible virus that steals people’s last moments with their loved ones.”

St. John also spoke to his mother.

“I told her I wished she was strong enough to hold on, but that if she needed to go, she could go, that we would be OK, that we would take good care of her dogs ... and that she would always be part of our lives,” he said.

She went quickly after that, he said.

Dr. Darryn Band, managing partner of the Capital Women’s Care practice in Silver Spring where Caro worked, said she was “a valued member of our team and her loss will be felt by her co-workers and patients."""

Here is a timeline of WHO's response to COVID-19:

(To note, as part of this timeline, the WHO released the international community's Strategic Preparedness and Response Plan on 3 February which outlines in its first pillar that:

""National public health emergency management mechanisms should be activated with engagement of relevant ministries such as health, education, travel and tourism, public works, environment, social protection, and agriculture, to provide coordinated management of COVID-19 preparedness and response.""

The US declared a state of emergency on March 12.

Really the entire document is a fantastic read about how countries should prepare themselves for this disease. Should the US, or any country, have read this document and complied with the directions presented, this whole pandemic could have been minimised considerably.

But it's far easier to blame the WHO for our leaders shortcomings... cause we failed to look into this deep enough.)

31 Dec 2019

China reported a cluster of cases of pneumonia in Wuhan, Hubei Province. A novel coronavirus was eventually identified.

1 January 2020

WHO had set up the IMST (Incident Management Support Team) across the three levels of the organization: headquarters, regional headquarters and country level, putting the organization on an emergency footing for dealing with the outbreak.

4  January 2020

WHO reported on social media that there was a cluster of pneumonia cases – with no deaths – in Wuhan, Hubei province. 

5 January 2020

WHO published our first Disease Outbreak News on the new virus. This is a flagship technical publication to the scientific and public health community as well as global media. It contained a risk assessment and advice, and reported on what China had told the organization about the status of patients and the public health response on the cluster of pneumonia cases in Wuhan.

10 January 2020

WHO issued a comprehensive package of technical guidance online with advice to all countries on how to detect, test and manage potential cases, based on what was known about the virus at the time. This guidance was shared with WHO's regional emergency directors to share with WHO representatives in countries. 

Based on experience with SARS and MERS and known modes of transmission of respiratory viruses, infection and prevention control guidance were published to protect health workers recommending droplet and contact precautions when caring for patients, and airborne precautions for aerosol generating procedures conducted by health workers.

12 January 2020

China publicly shared the genetic sequence of COVID-19. 

13 January 2020

Officials confirm a case of COVID-19 in Thailand, the first recorded case outside of China.  

14 January 2020

WHO's technical lead for the response noted in a press briefing there may have been limited human-to-human transmission of the coronavirus (in the 41 confirmed cases), mainly through family members, and that there was a risk of a possible wider outbreak. The lead also said that human-to-human transmission would not be surprising given our experience with SARS, MERS and other respiratory pathogens.  

20-21 January 2020

WHO experts from its China and Western Pacific regional offices conducted a brief field visit to Wuhan.

22 January 2020

WHO mission to China issued a statement saying that there was evidence of human-to-human transmission in Wuhan but more investigation was needed to understand the full extent of transmission.

22- 23 January 2020

The WHO Director- General convened-emergency-committee-regarding-the-outbreak-of-novel-coronavirus-(2019-ncov)) an Emergency Committee (EC) under the International Health Regulations (IHR 2005) to assess whether the outbreak constituted a public health emergency of international concern. The independent members from around the world could not reach a consensus based on the evidence available at the time. They asked to be reconvened within 10 days after receiving more information.

28 January 2020

A senior WHO delegation led by the Director-General travelled to Beijing to meet China’s leadership, learn more about China’s response, and to offer any technical assistance. 

While in Beijing, Dr. Tedros agreed with Chinese government leaders that an international team of leading scientists would travel to China on a mission to better understand the context, the overall response, and exchange information and experience.

30 January 2020

The WHO Director-General reconvened the Emergency Committee (EC). This was earlier than the 10-day period and only two days after the first reports of limited human-to-human transmission were reported outside China. This time, the EC reached consensus and advised the Director-General that the outbreak constituted a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC). The Director-General accepted the recommendation and declared the novel coronavirus outbreak (2019-nCoV) a PHEIC. This is the 6th time WHO has declared a PHEIC since the International Health Regulations (IHR) came into force in 2005.

3 February 2020 

WHO releases the international community's Strategic Preparedness and Response Plan to help protect states with weaker health systems. 

11-12 February 2020

WHO convened a Research and Innovation Forum on COVID-19, attended by more than 400 experts and funders from around the world, which included presentations by George Gao, Director General of China CDC, and Zunyou Wu, China CDC's chief epidemiologist. 

16-24 February 2020

The WHO-China Joint mission, which included experts from Canada, Germany, Japan, Nigeria, Republic of Korea, Russia, Singapore and the US (CDC, NIH) spent time in Beijing and also travelled to Wuhan and two other cities. They spoke with health officials, scientists and health workers in health facilities (maintaining physical distancing).

SCIENCECORONAVIRUS COVERAGE

The pandemic is giving people vivid, unusual dreams. Here’s why.

Researchers explain why withdrawal from our usual environments—due to social distancing—has left dreamers with a dearth of “inspiration.”

5 MINUTE READ

BY REBECCA RENNER

PUBLISHED APRIL 15, 2020

Ronald Reagan pulled up to the curb in a sleek black town car, rolled down his tinted window, and beckoned for Lance Weller, author of the novel Wilderness, to join him. The long-dead president escorted Weller to a comic book shop stocked with every title Weller had ever wanted, but before he could make a purchase, Reagan swiped his wallet and skipped out the door.

Of course, Weller was dreaming. He is one of many people around the world—including more than 600 featured in just one study—who say they are experiencing a new phenomenon: coronavirus pandemic dreams.

Science has long suggested that dream content and emotions are connected to wellbeing while we’re awake. Bizarre dreams laden with symbolism allow some dreamers to overcome intense memories or everyday psychological stressors within the safety of their subconscious. Nightmares, on the other hand, can be warning signs of anxieties that we might not otherwise perceive in our waking lives.

With hundreds of millions of people sheltering at home during the coronavirus pandemic, some dream experts believe that withdrawal from our usual environments and daily stimuli has left dreamers with a dearth of “inspiration,” forcing our subconscious minds to draw more heavily on themes from our past. In Weller’s case, his long-time obsession with comics came together with his constant scrolling through political posts on Twitter to concoct a surreal scene that he interpreted as a commentary on the world’s economic anxieties.

At least five research teams at institutions across multiple countries are collecting examples such as Weller’s, and one of their findings so far is that pandemic dreams are being colored by stress, isolation, and changes in sleep patterns—a swirl of negative emotions that set them apart from typical dreaming.

“We normally use REM sleep and dreams to handle intense emotions, particularly negative emotions,” says Patrick McNamara, an associate professor of neurology at Boston University School of Medicine who is an expert in dreams. “Obviously, this pandemic is producing a lot of stress and anxiety.”

Epicenter tripping

During our dream states, stress sends the brain on a trip. The neurobiological signals and reactions that produce dreams are similar to those triggered by psychedelic drugs, according to McNamara. Psychedelics activate nerve receptors called serotonin 5-HT2A, which then turn off a part of the brain called the dorsal prefrontal cortex. The result is known as “emotional disinhibition,” a state in which emotions flood the consciousness, especially during the rapid eye movement (REM) stage of sleep, when we typically dream.

Though these processes happen nightly, most people don’t typically remember their dreams. Living through the coronavirus pandemic might be changing that due to heightened isolation and stress, influencing the content of dreams and allowing some dreamers to remember more of them. For one, anxiety and lack of activity decrease sleep quality. Frequent awakenings, also called parasomnias, are associated with increased dream recall. Latent emotions and memories from the previous day can also influence the content of dreams and one’s emotional response within the dream itself.

According to an ongoing study the Lyon Neuroscience Research Center in France initiated in March, the coronavirus pandemic has caused a 35 percent increase in dream recall among participants, with respondents reporting 15 percent more negative dreams than usual. A different study promoted by Associazione Italiana di Medicina del Sonno (the Italian Association of Sleep Medicine) is analyzing the dreams of Italians confined during the outbreak. Many of the subjects are experiencing nightmares and parasomnias in line with symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder.

“Not surprisingly, some years ago when we studied survivors of the 2009 L’Aquila earthquake, we found that sleep disorders and also nightmares strictly depended on the proximity to the epicenter,” says Luigi De Gennaro, a professor of physiological psychology at the University of Rome who is working on the Italian coronavirus study. “In other words, the seismic map mostly overlapped that of sleep disturbances.”

Results from De Gennaro’s ongoing research and other work such as the Lyon study suggest that people closer to the pandemic threat—health-care workers, those living in epicenters, and those with affected family members—are more likely to experience outbreak-influenced dreams.

Overcoming the nightmares

Multiple studies have shown that our waking activities create a slide reel of memories that influence the content of our dreams. Emotions carried over from the day can influence what we dream about and how we feel about it within the dream itself. Reducing or restricting sources of everyday memories—by being stuck alone in quarantine—may limit the content of dreams or cause the subconscious to reach for deeper memories.

It may seem obvious, but Finnish researchers have scientifically backed up the notion that peace of mind leads to a “positive dream affect,” wherein dreamers feel good about what is happening in their dreams. Anxiety, by contrast, is related to “negative dream affect,” the data show, which results in dreams that are frightening or otherwise upsetting.

Deirdre Barrett, assistant professor of psychology at Harvard University and author of The Committee of Sleep, has collected and analyzed dreams from the survivors of traumatic events, including the September 11 World Trade Center Attacks. Barrett has found that dreams in which people process traumas tend to follow two patterns: They either directly reference or re-enact a version of the traumatic event, or the dreams are fantastical, with symbolic elements standing in for the trauma.

In Barrett’s latest sample of coronavirus dreams, which she began collecting in March with this survey, some participants reported dreaming they caught the virus or were dying of it. In another set of dreams Barrett collected, participants replaced fear of the virus with a metaphoric element, such as bugs, zombies, natural disasters, shadowy figures, monsters, or mass shooters.

“Except for the [dreams of] health-care workers, we don't see vivid visual imagery of people struggling to breathe on the ventilator,” Barrett says. “The virus is invisible, and I think that’s why it’s transformed into so many different things.”

For all their variety, the one thing many pandemic dreams have in common is how weird they seem to participants in the studies. “It may be one of the mechanisms used by the sleeping brain to induce emotional regulation,” says Perrine Ruby, a researcher at the Lyon Neuroscience Research Center.

For those experiencing coronavirus nightmares, there is growing evidence that so-called “dream mastery techniques” can alleviate their suffering.

When Barrett works with patients on “scripting” their own dreams, she often asks how they want the nightmare to be different. After a patient figures out their dream’s new direction, they can write it down and rehearse it before bed. These scripts range from more mundane solutions, like fighting off attackers, to more “dreamlike” scenarios, such as shrinking the attacker down to the size of an ant.

For those seeking to wrest some control over bad dreams, focusing on the “bizarre” may help, says Ruby, the researcher from Lyon. “Changing the context—the laws of physics and so on—may change the perspective [and] propose another angle, a shift in the understanding which may help to change or play down emotion.”"

Normally she always seems to have a runny nose and other gross toddler things going on. 

In the last day, though, she's had a fever and other cold/flu symptoms, and I'm trying not to panic. She's been home for a month and we've been sheltering in place in an area that doesn't have many cases (Orange County, CA), so it's unlikely that it's anything more than a bug, but of course the constant coronavirus news is making much more anxious than I normally would be."

March 17: ""It snuck up on us.""

March 24: “THE CURE CANNOT BE WORSE (by far) THAN THE PROBLEM!”

March 26: ""I don't believe you need 40,000 or 30,000 ventilators. You know, you go into major hospitals, sometimes they'll have two ventilators. And now all of a sudden they're saying, 'Can we order 30,000 ventilators?'""

March 26: “They have to go back to work; our country has to go back. Our country is based on that, and I think it’s going to happen pretty quickly.”

March 29: “So you’re talking about [worst-case scenarios of] 2.2 million deaths, 2.2 million people from this. And so if we could hold that down, as we’re saying, to 100,000 — it’s a horrible number, maybe even less — but to 100,000.

Nothing is prepared until it is right in front of their noses. Then there are lots of bold statements while behind the scenes there's a frantic rush to cobble something together. Occasionally this works (coronavirus hospitals), usually it doesn't (protective gear, testing).

Even that, I think, is a little harsh.  He didn't want to run in 2016, but no one else (looking at you, Warren) in the Democratic Party was willing to talk about the type of healthcare real countries have.  Bernie knew then that he risked his place in the Senate by going up against the Clinton establishment, so the conclusion is that he cared more about even just shifting the conversation on healthcare than he did about his career.  He's an old man on the verge of retirement; what's left of his career anyways?

He's doing something similar here.  He's trying to insulate the left so it can continue to grow, because he does in fact care about this stuff more than his career.  If he was chiefly concerned about his career he would have dropped out a lot sooner; he wouldn't have waited to see if coronavirus or Biden's rape allegation changed the landscape.  He's at the point where he can't help the left anymore, but he could still hurt them if he takes his ball and goes home.  He knows that and is acting accordingly."

Alabama already had stay at home orders in place. Palm Beach County declared a state of emergency on March 13. Palm Beach County issued its first emergency order on March 22 closing certain areas and services. Hannah waited until after Florida issued a stay at home order to leave Florida on April 1 or 2– the eve of when the Order took effect. Prior to that, many cities and counties in Florida already had stay at home orders as well. In other words, Hannah waited until the regulations could possibly impact *her* negatively before she took any action— for the weeks when it was just about other people facing repercussions, like illness and death, she did her thing and publicized ignoring health recommendations. Once she could get a misdemeanor for it, she left. At that time, she entered a state which already had stay at home orders in place, taking a 10 hour drive to get there which no doubt included gas and food stops. Upon entry, she did not self-isolate for 2 weeks. There are about 100 deaths from COVID19 in Palm Beach County and 1,704 confirmed cases— the deaths are almost equal to Miami-Dade County.

*The most notorious example came in the form of a single tweet from the WHO account on January 14: “Preliminary investigations conducted by the Chinese authorities have found no clear evidence of human-to-human transmission of the novel #coronavirus.” That same day, the Wuhan Health Commission’s public bulletin declared, “We have not found proof for human-to-human transmission.” But by that point even the Chinese government was offering caveats not included in the WHO tweet. “The possibility of limited human-to-human transmission cannot be excluded,” the bulletin said, “but the risk of sustained transmission is low.”*

*Even in January, when Chinese authorities were downplaying the extent of the virus, doctors at the epicenter of the outbreak in Wuhan reportedly observed human-to-human transmission, not least by contracting the disease themselves. In the most famous example, Dr. Li Wenliang was censured for “spreading rumors” after trying to alert other doctors of the new respiratory ailment; he later died of the virus himself at age 33. China now claims him as a martyr. Asked about Li’s case at a press conference, the executive director of the WHO’s Health Emergencies Programme, Michael Ryan, said, “We all mourn the loss of a fellow physician and colleague” but stopped short of condemning China for accusing him. “There is an understandable confusion that occurs at the beginning of an epidemic,” Ryan added. “So we need to be careful to label misunderstanding versus misinformation; there's a difference. People can misunderstand and they can overreact.”*

*Those lost early weeks also coincided with the Chinese New Year, for which millions of people travel to visit family and friends. “That’s when millions of Wuhan people were misinformed,” Xiao said. “Then they traveled all over China, all over the world.”*

*The WHO, meanwhile, was getting its information from the same Chinese authorities who were misinforming their own public, and then offering it to the world with its own imprimatur. On January 20, a Chinese official confirmed publicly for the first time that the virus could indeed spread among humans, and within days locked down Wuhan. But by then it was too late. It took another week for the WHO to declare the spread of the virus a global health emergency—during which time Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the WHO’s director-general, visited China and praised the country’s leadership for “setting a new standard for outbreak response.”*

He’s also a military doctor currently working on national coronavirus response/public health stuff. He knows his shit in that area. (Think of him as a public health Ben Carson, if that helps.)

Over the last several weeks he’s taken to beseeching Candace and her ilk on twitter to Listen To The Professionals and Take This Seriously, trying in vain to make them understand why pandemics cause strain on healthcare systems and why massive public response/government intervention is necessary. “I’m a huge fan! Don’t throw away your reputation on this!” and so forth

Sir, she has never listened to a professional in her life, and she’s not going to start now. I still hold out hope that seeing how dangerously, belligerently wrong his faves are being about coronavirus (again, something that he actually KNOWS THINGS ABOUT) will make him reflect on some of the other things they could be wrong about"

&#x200B;

PM: We've have announced some difficult measurements a couple of weeks ago, it was hard but we (mostly) succeeded. We managed to slow down the spread of the virus and help the hospitals stay on top of the situation.

Our hospital capacity is still enough to help everyone who needs it. Sadly, the amount of people in ICU is still quite high, and we hope the number will go down soon.

The situation in the care center is very difficult. I can assure you that we are working hard to create solutions for this situations.

For example: we are giving extra resources to the care centers via 'defense'. Extra testing is being done as we speak. (+210 000 tests in total)

Testing like this helps us show where peaks are located and help us getting a clearer view on the exact number of deceased (in the day care centers).

Belgium has been very open and clear on the numbers we gave every day. even then, It is possible that the numbers are over estimated.

\---

We have to think about the families who lost someone, health care employees who fight every day to safe lives.

Those, together with all other first-line workers have to be able to work in the best situations possible, that's why we've been able to distribute X amount maskers of FFP2 and surgical masks.

\---

It's clear that we need to keep going and keep following the rules in action.

All rules are decided together with the view of experts and people from all sectors.

\---

It has been decided that all current rules are **prolonged until 3 may** .

DIY-shops and garden centers can open in the same way as general stores. (safety distance has to be followed etc)

Habitants of care centers are allowed to get **visits by 1 person**, decided beforehand, every time the same person and that person cannot have shown symptoms for at least 2 weeks before the visits. It is the care centers who have to organise this.

The same rule is for people who live alone and cannot visit others themselves.

It is important that all rules are followed by everyone. The things above do NOT mean that people can think that the rules are less 'strong' than before.

Nobody wants that everyone is punished because a couple of us don't take it serious.

Police will continue giving penalties to all infractions. Police is there to serve and protect us. They should get our respect.

\---

If you notice it is not possible to keep a safe distance wherever you want to go (for example: a public parc) it is better to return another time instead.

Construction sites can stay open (for workers of course) with these rules in mind, and container parcs are allowed to be open as well. (just to clarify the rules).

\---

This evening, I promised that I would speak about the future, so here I am.

I'll try to be as transparant as possible and without any false promises.

Today nobody can tell us when we will be open to return to the ""normal"" life. There are still challenges to come.  Our willpower will be tested. But an improved future is getting closer.

Next week we will organise another national security consultations to get an update on the situation. Our goal is to start to organise the 'easing' of the rules and return to 'casual' life.

\--- *(note from translator: she's talking faster than usual, or I'm more tired than usual :p )*

It's clear that wearing masks will be an important part in the strategy. When the safety measures will start to ease out, (surgical) masks will have to be worn in certain situations.

We're working with local (Belgian) companies for the production of those masks.

Watch out, masks DO NOT REPLACE other safety/hygiene rules.

\---

**Until 31 august: No mass events (like festivals)**

\---

We still have to look at how we will deal with the openings of local shops, bars, restaurants, schools, ... But everything in time. We're not there yet. Same counts for travels, internships, youth camps, ...

\---

Teleworking will be preferred for a (long) time to come.

All other rules for working situations and companies will be dealt with for each sector at a time and will be communicated when known.

\---

We're working together with the countries next to us and with the EU.

But, comparing doesn't always mean that we have to follow. We will take our own decisions when we seem them fit.

As you can see, we're actively preparing the transition period to ""normal"" life. The word ""transition"" is important because we have to work in steps.

It's important to know that as of now, no Vaccination or ""miraculous cure"" for Covid-19/Coronavirus.

\---

As a last note, I want to address those who feel lonely.

We are not yet at the end of the road, but we will get there.

We will come out stronger and closer. But in the meantime, please take care of yourself and those around you.

\----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Q&A: (not translating everything here)

**Q:** First Question, in short: why are the people who help take decisions, allowed to take those  permissions, because person A worked for this company, person B got money from that company etc?

**A:** People are allowed to change jobs, are allowed to work for different companies, and your past work doesn't define your character.

&#x200B;

**Q2**: I didn't catch the question because of the sound :( Sorry

A: Only got part of the answer. But it seems like it was about the situations in care centers and that the one asking the question asked if the situation there wasn't neglected.

&#x200B;

**Q3:** Why the 4th may and not another date like other countries around us. Was it hard picking that date?

**A3:** It was not easy, but it follows what we said before: 2 weeks ago we said it could be prolonged by 2 more weeks and here we are. Also, we are ""Belgium"" so we can decide ourself, depending on how -we- see the situation how we deal with this. There is no need to follow others or compare and copy 100%. Today, there are a lot of people who don't go to the hospital even when needed, because they are scared for this virus or to be a burden. We had to take all this in mind.

&#x200B;

**Q4:** what are ""mass events"" exactly? + What will we know more next week that we don't know today yet?

**A4:** we don't know yet what we will know more next week, because we evaluate the numbers we get day by day.

For the festivals, we took the decision already because it takes a lot of time to organise (or cancel) an event like this. We don't have an exact number for what a ""mass event"" is , but festivals know that they have to cancel. Until 3 may general gatherings are forbidden, and we'll try to define more exact what mass events mean as soon as possible.

Return to the ""what we know more next week"": we'll try to define the easing steps, depending on how the virus propagates.

We asked the experts to create a plan for the next few weeks, but all these decisions have to be measured against each other: easing one thing means we can't remove another rule (opening all shops sooner means we maybe have to wait longer for youth camps for example)

(3 minutes later she's still answering the question..)

Dr. Fauci said later that week that he wished efforts to pit him against the President would stop and added that “there are not differences. The President has listened to what I have said.” The media bait continued with a March 26 Washington Post story titled, “As Trump signals readiness to break with experts, his online base assails Fauci.” The Post also tweeted that “Trump trails Fauci by 26 percent in public approval of coronavirus response,” as if the two are running a campaign against each other.

[How Trump has put the onus on states amid the coronavirus pandemic](https://outline.com/hMwS8C)

In fact, Trump is *intentionally* not doing anything to help because he doesn’t want to be caught holding the bag in an election year. Literally all he cares about is himself and his political fortunes — that he goes about so nakedly is truly grotesque to observe in real time. 

See: 

> Since making that decision [to announce national social distance advisory/ “15 days to slow the spread”] however, Trump has been agitating to find ways for businesses to reopen, mindful that he could end up paying a political price for the staggering number of unemployed Americans.

> Inside the White House, it has been clear to officials since last week that **there is no longer much of a debate — at least with the president — about starting the reopening process May 1,** said numerous current and former senior administration officials, most of whom spoke on the condition of anonymity to candidly discuss the state of play.


> “He desperately wants to reopen as much as possible on May 1,” said one former official briefed on internal discussions. “He’s been that way from the beginning, and he has not wavered. He seems determined to do it. But there’s a growing realization that you won’t be able to open everything up by May 1. Even he realizes that’s a bad idea.”

> **Rather, the debate this week has been over how to implement the return, what data could be used to justify the decision, and how to build public support for it to provide the president maximum political cover,** according to one senior administration official involved in the discussions and a second person who has been briefed on them.


> **Trump’s advisers are trying to shield the president from political accountability should his move to reopen the economy prove premature and result in lost lives, and so they are trying to mobilize business executives, economists and other prominent figures to buy into the eventual White House plan, so that if it does not work, the blame can be shared broadly**, according to two former administration officials familiar with the efforts.

You should read the article above, and then in conjunction with that, read this politico piece [‘Should have happened yesterday’: Republicans press Trump to restart economy](https://www.politico.com/news/2020/04/15/republicans-trump-economy-coronavirus-186452) from today to see just how shamelessly and transparently the GOP is ushering American citizens to a hasty death. Like, that article is just .... a sea to shining sea representation of politicians and party aligned organizations across the republican coalition spectrum saying shit that just sounds - in ~~a~~ 2 words - fucking insane. 

They intend to loosen restrictions **with no plan** to slow or quash a resurgence. We’re nowhere near as prepared as we need to be to do that. Meanwhile, Trump is (STILL!) intentionally not doing *the one thing that needs to happen* to ensure that such a move can be done safely: expanding testing capacity. In fact, federal support for testing capacity was cutoff last week! It’s outrageous. 

And the cherry on top is like 80+% of Americans agree that it’s a bad idea to lift restrictions right now and that we shouldn’t try until we get it under control - *no matter how long it takes.* 

What’s absolutely baffling about this is that the public is going to see Republicans playing games with peoples lives and it’s going to backfire spectacularly. Why are they doing this? It’s electoral suicide. How can they not see this? It’s as inexplicable as it is craven. Sometimes, you have to stand back and marvel at the outright fuckery of it all. I mean, the breadth and scale of the collective bad decisions involved here is just... what’s in the water in Trump country? I guess it doesn’t matter if Fox News and Rush radio is blasting the background all day, now does it?

From the video:
""Please, for you and your families, stop sending emails, cards, and letters saying that we are disrespecting you. If you feel that way, we can understand that. You're entitled to your opinion. It raises for us whether you, in fact, want to keep working for [institution redacted]. I'm not gonna continue to harp on that, but I ask you, really, you have to make your own judgments.""

When interviewed by CBS's David Begnaud regarding her comments in the video ([full interview](https://twitter.com/DavidBegnaud/status/1248756011151867905)), she was evasive in her responses to direct questions and remained unregretful and unapologetic.

Although [name redacted] claims that her comments were directed at ""back office staff"", no employee should be threatened with professional retaliation for expressing that they feel disrespected by their employer.

This is conduct unbecoming of a person in a position of leadership and of a person charged with maintaining a safe working environment for hospital staff, especially considering the dangerous nature of the coronavirus pandemic and its effect on hospital staff. Thusly, [name redacted] is unfit to serve as [position and institution redacted] and should resign from or be removed from her position, effective immediately.

During a question-and-answer session following his April 13 press conference about the fight against COVID-19, Governor Jared Polis remained confident that the state will be able to meet the April 26 end date on his current stay-at-home order, which is among the most optimistic in the country.

This upbeat assessment is supported by modeling from the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation at the University of Washington, which asserted that April 13 would prove to be the peak date for U.S. deaths associated with the novel coronavirus. Moreover, the latest state-by-state breakdown by the IHME, which has become one of the nation's most widely cited sources for COVID-19 projections, contends that Colorado's own peak actually occurred back on April 2, and offers fresh data to support this conclusion.

It is well known why that is: because of the weekend backlog, normally corrected on Tuesday, this week on Wednesday because of Easter. But the trend is still downward because *reported deaths =/= deaths per day*. 

There is no reason to be optimistic or pessimistic. The trend is going down, that's a fact.

As for cases, these behave more erratically because of the changing testing capacity and policy. Increased testing might also increase the reported deaths, which would make it harder to properly discern a trend in deaths. That's why hospitalisations are the best statistic to focus on, along with the amount of corona patients currently in the ICU (which also seems to be declining)."

There are times when bad reports are bad news and prompt traders to unload stocks, and times when bad is good and sparks furious rallies.

Then there’s now, when bad data seem to mean almost nothing. The figures documenting the coronavirus-induced collapse are so horrific -- like 6.6 million new jobless claims last week alone -- it’s hard to fathom them.

Moreover, the reports generally look backward -- not exactly the kind of information that interests traders as they bid stocks higher day after day. Instead, investors are focused on giant new lending programs from the Federal Reserve, trillions in stimulus from the government and the latest statistics on cases of the virus, which show some signs of leveling off or easing.

This week traders’ eyes also are pointed at company earnings, and the forward guidance that comes with them, to help assess the pace of a rebound. Many are looking ahead optimistically and betting that some form of economic recovery will come into view soon as government officials plot how to allow companies to restart operations.

“After the economy begins to reopen,” said Stephen Stanley, chief economist at Amherst Pierpont Securities, “then there will be data that give insight into the trajectory of the rebound.”

Stocks plunged, then rebounded, even as data have worsened
This, of course, could still be several weeks, or even months, away. It all depends on how quickly the pandemic is controlled and testing and treatments are developed.

The extreme bull case says there is no choice but to write off 2020 and focus instead on first signs of the recovery. That assumes, though, there will be a swift rebound in economic activity and little structural damage to the major corporations that make up the S&P 500 Index.

The index plunged by more than a third between Feb. 19 and March 23 amid the spreading crisis, which President Donald Trump declared a national emergency on March 13. Yet stocks in the index have risen by a quarter since Congress enacted a $2.2 trillion relief package and the Federal Reserve pledged $2.3 trillion in lending.

Recovery Signs
“We are getting to the point now where data will not be completely backward-looking,” said Jay Bryson, acting chief economist at Wells Fargo & Co. “Retail sales data for March will be very important because it will give people a sense of how much retail spending cratered in March due to the lockdowns that began mid-month. Initial claims will continue to be important over the next few weeks to see how bad the labor market really is.”

Wednesday’s report on retail sales is expected to reveal an 8% drop, with some forecasts as low as a 24% plunge.

Still, the economic data that will prove most important to markets are statistics that start to show some signs of recovery, said Jim Paulsen, chief investment strategist at Leuthold Group, who published a report Monday advising clients to look past the rush of awful numbers.

“Is it really useful to figure out whether second quarter real GDP is collapsing at a 25% or 50% annualized pace?” he wrote in his client note. “Is it somehow important for stocks if weekly unemployment claims are 3 million, 6 million, or 10 million?”

President Trump and some state leaders are starting to talk about reopening the economy as early as May -- though that depends on having the virus under control. New cases in New York appear to have plateaued, though some states continue to see a rise in new infections. Health-care officials warn it’s essential to have the pandemic contained with massive testing available before business restarts -- or else risk a resurgence.

What Bloomberg Economists Say
“It is premature to assess characteristics of a rebound when the economy is still accelerating into contraction. The profile of the eventual recovery will be shaped significantly by the speed and magnitude of the decline preceding it. However, some high frequency indicators, which are currently still deteriorating, at some point will turn and signal an eventual recovery.”


The economic reports also might matter if they are “surprisingly better-than-expected if the fiscal and monetary stimulus cushions the downside,” said Ed Yardeni, president of Yardeni Research Inc.

“Some data coming from China can be helpful because China is two months ahead of the U.S.,” said Zhiwei Ren, portfolio manager at Penn Mutual Asset Management. “Seeing how China is opening and recovering gives us some idea of what the U.S. economy can look like. China’s recent export and import data was better than expected, and that can be positive for the U.S.”

Of all the reports documenting the decline, weekly unemployment claims give the best picture of how fast the job market is deteriorating -- and eventually recovering. In addition, the monthly jobs report -- next out on May 8 -- will give a clearer picture of the industries most affected.

Investors see claims as perhaps best real-time indicator of virus's damage
“It is the most sensitive, timely and accurate indicator of the economy’s performance,” said Mark Zandi, chief economist for Moody’s Analytics, of weekly claims. “It will help gauge the depth of the job losses, when the job market is stabilizing and when it has begun to rebound and where.”

High-Frequency Data
A number of financial companies, including Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Deutsche Bank AG and Citigroup Inc., have published private-sector real-time indicators, looking at restaurant reservations, hotel occupancy, electricity usage and airport traffic via security checkpoints, among other reports.

“The more high-frequency stuff will be more closely watched,” said Mark McCormick, global head of FX strategy at Toronto Dominion Bank, such as trade data from South Korea, traffic congestion, shipping-vessel movements and air quality.

Once parts of the U.S. start to reopen to business, data that suggest the pace -- such as business and consumer confidence, and credit defaults and bankruptcies -- will be important to watch.

Later this month, there will be the usual flurry of reports on everything from housing to manufacturing and consumer confidence. Investors probably will still ignore most of it.

“Markets will not start reacting to data until it tells us something about how rapidly conditions are normalizing,” said Andrew Hollenhorst, chief U.S. economist at Citigroup. “That means we will be waiting for data from May or June.”"

> “The WHO doesn’t recommend and actually opposes any restrictions for travel and trade or other measures against China,

All available research shows that selective travel bans are ineffective. At best they merely slow the spread of the disease by a couple days.

I’ve seen some loon get up in front of the whole store and announce that Jesus Christ is the cure for coronavirus.

I watched an old lady walk around holding a scarf over her mouth like it was the only thing keeping her alive, then while talking to me she pulls the scarf down, rubs her nose with her bare hand and then starts touching things. She walked away before I could confront her because it really did stun me for a second. 

I had the lady who was next in line to enter the store get huffy with the employee running crowd control because I was let in ahead of her despite the fact that the employee clearly knew me personally (greeted me by name) and I was literally wearing a sweater that said the name of the grocery store I work for on it. I work there. I was coming in for my shift. I don’t wear a grocery store sweater cause it’s fashionable.

I bought a few items at the end of my shift last week and I don’t know if he was being a douche or was genuinely just that blind but a guy with a full cart tried to swoop in as I was gathering my items to leave the cash, skipping the entire line of at least 6 or 7 people waiting properly. He got shut down and sent to the back of the line pretty quickly. 

People arguing with crowd control employees: “Please let me in I only need pineapple/carrots/ground beef” like they’re more important than everyone else waiting and therefore don’t need to respect the pandemic protocols. 

A lot of people who think if they’re asking me a question the 6ft rule suddenly doesn’t exist. Don’t fucking stick that list in my face and repeat your question moistly 7 times while I try to back away from your face which is inexplicably 8 inches from mine. Read me the list from 6 fucking feet away.

##Analysts expect the country to make bondholders an offer they cannot accept

   
April 12, 2020 12:54 pm by Benedict Mander in Buenos Aires and Colby Smith in New York
Argentina is heading for its ninth sovereign debt default, analysts have warned, with increasingly frustrated investors set to reject the government’s debt restructuring offer due this month.


Last week, the centre-left government delayed payments on $10bn of local-law debt, a move seen by many as a signal of what is to come.


After missing a self-imposed deadline of March 31 to reach a deal on $83bn of external debt owed to private investors, officials said last week that talks would continue until at least the end of this week.


The process, already beset with delays, has been further set back by the disruption on financial markets caused by the coronavirus crisis, which analysts said would make it easier for President Alberto Fernández to justify a default.


Carlos Abadi of Decision Boundaries, a financial advisory firm, said the government risked making an offer to investors without first ensuring it had enough of them on side. “I fear that Argentina may jump into the pool without first making sure there is water in it,” he said. “The result is likely to be a failure of the offer and, hence, default.”


A bondholder involved in negotiations said Argentina was heading towards a “hard” default, with no prior agreement with investors. “It is very hard to be optimistic,” this person said.


Prices of Argentina’s sovereign dollar bonds have plummeted in a broad sell-off of riskier assets due to the coronavirus pandemic, to levels suggesting investors expect an imminent default.


The country’s international bond maturing in April 2021 has fallen 45 per cent since the beginning of March and now hovers around 30 cents on the dollar. The country’s once-vaunted 100-year bond, issued in 2017, has plunged to 26 cents on the dollar, a more than 35 per cent fall since the beginning of March. 


“Seeing where bond prices are now, the government probably feels more empowered and believes it can put forward more aggressive terms,” said Patrick Esteruelas, head of research at Emso Asset Management. That would make negotiations with bondholders even more protracted, he said.


Settling Argentina’s debt issues was widely seen as essential to solving its economic woes, including a recession now in its third year and inflation of about 50 per cent. But any sense of urgency in government for doing so has diminished since the spread of Covid-19.


##Recommended


Can Argentina escape a debt default?
Mr Fernández, who has a reputation as a skilled negotiator, has repeatedly said he wants to avoid a default. But he has also insisted that this must not be at the expense of the wellbeing of Argentines. The coronavirus crisis has underscored the government’s other goal of securing fiscal and financial relief through debt restructuring.


The next test will come on April 22, when Argentina is due to pay about $500m to bondholders. 


Gordon Bowers, an emerging markets research analyst at Columbia Threadneedle, said he expected Argentina to fall into hard default at that point. “If negotiations aren’t progressing and it looks like a deal can’t be done in the 30-day grace period, it doesn’t make a lot of sense [for the government] to let go of $500m,” he said, especially as net foreign exchange reserves have dwindled to about $12bn.


But others say a default is not yet inevitable. Some analysts recommend a standstill in negotiations until the coronavirus crisis has passed and Argentina’s economy has stabilised. Mr Abadi said creditors would accept “a one-year reprofiling”, which would also satisfy Argentina’s need to stop bleeding dollars through debt payments.


“If a debt deal was improbable last year, in this context it looks nearly impossible. But the crisis opens a new door,” said Eduardo Levy Yeyati, a local economist, who sees a standstill as Argentina’s only viable option.


He argued that such an offer to bondholders could be “sweetened” by using some of the $13bn that remains to be disbursed from Argentina’s currently suspended $57bn IMF programme — implemented when it came to the country’s rescue during a currency crisis in 2018 — as an upfront payment to creditors."
2020-04-15,PropagandaDebunker,conspiracy,20,https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/g1qjhr/robert_f_kennedy_jr_on_instagram_anthony_faucis/fnh12rt/,"SS: The Daily Mail reported that it has uncovered documents showing that Anthony Fauci’s NIAID gave $3.7 million to scientists at the Wuhan Lab at the center of coronavirus leak scrutiny. According to the British paper, “the federal grant funded experiments on bats from the caves where the virus is believed to have originated.”
Background: following the 2002-2003 SARS coronavirus outbreak, NIH funded a collaboration by Chinese scientists, US military virologists from the bioweapons lab at Fort Detrick & NIH scientists from NIAID to prevent future coronavirus outbreaks by studying the evolution of virulent strains from bats in human tissues. Those efforts included “gain of function” research that used a process called “accelerated evolution” to create COVID Pandemic superbugs, enhanced bat borne COVID mutants more lethal and more transmissible than wild COVID. Fauci’s studies alarmed scientists around the globe who complained, according a Dec. 2017 NY Times article, that “these researchers risk creating a monster germ that could escape the lab and seed a pandemic.” Dr. Marc Lipsitch of the Harvard School of Public Health’s Communicable Disease Center told the Times that Dr. Fauci’s NIAID experiments “have given us some modest scientific knowledge and done almost nothing to improve our preparedness for pandemic, and yet risked creating an accidental pandemic.” In October 2014, following a series of federal laboratory mishaps that narrowly missed releasing these deadly engineered viruses, President Obama ordered the halt to all federal funding for Fauci’s dangerous experiments. It now appears that Dr. Fauci may have dodged the federal restrictions by shifting the research to the military lab in Wuhan. Congress needs to launch an investigation of NIAID’s mischief in China."

The mortality rate is currently at 0.17, which is in line with Influenza. If you want to count bodies it would be roughly 22K Wuhan Coronavirus versus 83K Influenza.

>	Steroid compounds, which are expected to have dual functions in blocking host inflammation and MERS-CoV replication, were screened from a chemical library. Within this library, ciclesonide, an inhaled corticosteroid, suppressed human coronavirus replication in cultured cells, but did not suppress replication of respiratory syncytial virus or influenza virus. The effective concentration of ciclesonide to block SARS-CoV-2 (the cause of COVID-19) replication (EC90) was 6.3 μM. After the eleventh consecutive MERS-CoV passage in the presence of ciclesonide, a resistant mutation was generated, which resulted in an amino acid substitution (A25V) in nonstructural protein (NSP) 15, as identified using reverse genetics. A recombinant virus with the mutation was also resistant to ciclesonide suppression of viral replication. These observations suggest that the effect of ciclesonide was specific to coronavirus, suggesting this is a candidate drug for treatment of patients suffering MERS or COVID-19."

*This obituary is part of a series about people who have died in the coronavirus pandemic.*

Joseph Migliucci’s parents wanted more for their young son than the family restaurant business. So they gave him the hardest jobs, like cleaning the floors and washing dishes.

“Finally I put him behind the range and thought, ‘This will kill him. He’s going to hate it,’” his father, Mario Migliucci, said in an article by The New York Times food critic Craig Claiborne in 1976. “Not a bit. And now he’s good at everything. Terrific bartender, good host, the works.”

Joseph Migliucci stayed on at the restaurant, Mario’s, for nearly a half century more, maintaining its tradition as a red-sauce cornerstone of the Bronx’s Little Italy on Arthur Avenue in the Belmont section.

Mr. Migliucci, the fourth generation of his family to own the restaurant, died on April 6 at a hospital in White Plains, N.Y. He was 81. His daughter, Regina Migliucci-Delfino, said the cause was the novel coronavirus.

The restaurant was opened in 1919 by Joseph’s great-grandmother, Scholastica Migliucci, an Italian immigrant, as a pizzeria with six tables. Joseph’s father, Mario Migliucci, and his Uncle Clemente took over management in the 1930s, expanded the menu and renamed it Mario’s.

Joseph took a job in the restaurant at around age 13, according to his daughter. In recent decades he and Ms. Migliucci-Delfino ran it.

Mr. Migliucci would come to work each day in a button-down shirt and suspenders often adorned with a big yellow pin that read, “I’m the boss.” He would add to customers, “But when I go home, I give the pin to my wife.”

Mr. Claiborne described the restaurant’s fare as “first‐rate, unpretentious but adventurous Neapolitan cookery.”

Mario Puzo name-checked the restaurant in his novel “The Godfather.” When producers of the movie version asked about filming a scene there, his father declined. “He didn’t want that stigma,” Mr. Migliucci said.

Mr. Migliucci was born in Manhattan in Nov. 18, 1938. His mother, Rose Migliucci, also worked at the restaurant.

He attended Samuel Gompers Industrial High School in the Bronx and went on to study engineering at a local college before returning to the family business. “He loved engineering, but he had a love for people,” his daughter said. “And he loved the restaurant business.”

Mr. Migliucci married Francis Lagamma in 1961. Along with Regina, they had another daughter, Michele. The couple divorced and Mr. Migliucci married Barbara Farino. They had two children, Nicole and Mario.

Along with his wife and children, he is survived by his sister Diane Lentini, 16 grandchildren and three great-grandchildren.

Ms. Migliucci-Delfino said she will continue the family legacy and run the restaurant."

First, let me note that there are many limitations to reading this data and taking it as gospel. While we can always use as much information as the city / county are willing to provide, our main hurdle right now is that we don't have information on testing locally. It might be the single most important thing when looking at this data and trying to reach a conclusion, and yet we remain in the dark about it. This is not something that I blame our officials for, it is mainly a product of how this information is reported / collected. The best thing that we can do is make sure our officials know that active testing is a priority for their voters.

You can [**GO HERE**](https://www.austintexas.gov/contact-us) and find contact information for you district council member. I highly recommend contacting them. The message shouldn't be that we need more information about testing, it should be that testing is one of the most impactful things that we can do. It needs to be aggressive, and widespread. All healthcare workers should be tested routinely. Symptoms or not. Front line workers should be tested routinely. Beyond that we should be testing as many people as possible.

**Commentary:**

New count looks bigger than it is. Not great, but also not horrible.  The University of Texas at Austin confirmed that 83 students and eight employees have tested positive, or are presumptive positive, for COVID-19. This may have contributed to this bump today; timing is right. Of note, The [City of Austin Dashboard](https://austin.maps.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html#/39e4f8d4acb0433baae6d15a931fa984) has a few oopsies today. The age chart is messed up and the Epi chart is flat-out missing. It had some missing data in it last time though, so that may have been cause for concern.

There are 89 people hospitalized in the 5 county MSA (metropolitan statistics area) that are confirmed COVID-19 cases. 47 (+5) of those are in the ICU and 27(-3) are on ventilators. Our Trauma Service Area has 389 ventilators available. Out of the confirmed COVID-19 cases, the county reports that 178 have now recovered. Up 20 from the day before. I'll be looking to include this data in my graphics as soon as we have more data points to work with.

The average daily rate of change since we crossed 100 cases is 11.3%. That is 12 days of continuing to flatten the curve; even if this time we only flattened by .1%.  Good job Austin! Today’s rate of change is 8.6%. I think we are at the point where I feel like I can say that the secondary effects of the UT students going on spring break would have showed up by now. Hopefully that means it was caught early enough and those that were infected were responsible with their actions.

Lastly, the death toll increased to 17.

Be safe Austin. Take care of each other.

Also, thank you to everyone giving me gold and platinum. It means the world that you find this helpful. Please use that money and donate to a cause that can help the people in our city. I don't need it. Thank you for the support!

[Post, Politico announce groundbreaking partnership to expand expert coverage of US-China ties](https://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/article/2147279/post-politico-announce-groundbreaking-partnership-expand-expert)

>A partnership was ­announced on Tuesday that will see the *South China Morning Post* team up with top American media ­company Politico to expand ­authoritative coverage of US-China relations.  
The   newsrooms of the two media organisations will share content and   collaborate on reporting opportunities and events in the United States   and Asia.  
The *Post* has a fast-growing global readership and has been reporting on China and Asia for more than a century.   
Politico,   launched in 2007, has publications in Washington, New York and   Brussels, and is highly regarded for its specialised coverage of   politics and policy.   
“The   groundbreaking partnership represents a major ­alignment of two   prominent news organisations with complementary geographical reach and   ­editorial expertise, and also represents milestones in both Politico’s   ambition to establish a deeper foothold in Asia and *SCMP*’s growth in the US market,” the two companies said in a press release.  
Tammy Tam, editor-in-chief of the *Post*, said: “This content partnership represents a milestone for *SCMP*   by expanding our coverage to new audiences, and allowing us to  leverage  our breadth and depth of expertise on China with Politico, one  of the  world’s most innovative and ­ambitious digital newsrooms.”  
Gary Liu, CEO of the *Post*,   said: “Readers from across the world are realising that China needs to   be better understood through journalism that offers a plurality of   views.   
“This  collaboration will  ­provide distinctive and contextualised coverage on  the interplay  between the US and China, a  relationship that impacts the  entire  world.”   
The agreement was also ­welcomed by Robert Allbritton, Politico’s owner and publisher.   
“The   relationship between the US and China is one of the most important   conversations shaping this next generation of decision makers, with   consequences echoing not only in Washington, DC and Hong Kong, but   around the world,” he said.  
John   Harris, co-founder and editor-in-chief of Politico, added: “We’re very   excited about this ­collaboration between two equally ambitious global   media companies with a shared set of values and vision for what we   produce for our respective audiences.

We’re having less new cases every day, just look at [This](https://www.health.govt.nz/our-work/diseases-and-conditions/covid-19-novel-coronavirus/covid-19-current-situation/covid-19-current-cases). If you look at the new cases per day, you can see that the curve is flattened, we’ve gone from a maximum of 90-100 cases per day to 15-20, and that number is still dropping daily. 

And that’s only what she’s doing with coronavirus. She also banned semiautomatic weapons and united the nation in the wake of the Christchurch Mosque attacks last year, and is pushing for free tertiary education (she has already given us one year free and is pushing it up to three); all of this while pregnant or with her newborn baby!


She makes me proud to be a New Zealander, I only hope the rest of the world (especially the USA and our siblings in Aus) can elect a leader as wonderful as ours. Until then, Kia Kaha!"

Way it sounds, the plan is to give suggestions for reopening the country in the states not hit by COVID-19. This is an early plan

>The version obtained by The Post appears to be an early draft by FEMA and contains granular instructions for a phased reopening of institutions such as schools, child-care facilities, summer camps, parks, faith-based organizations and restaurants.

Some other relevant quotes:

> The plan lays out three phases: Preparing the nation to reopen with a national communication campaign and community readiness assessment until May 1. Then, the effort through May 15 would involve ramping up manufacturing of testing kits and personal protective equipment and increasing emergency funding. Then staged reopenings would begin, depending on local conditions. The plan does not give dates for reopenings but specified “not before May 1.”

> The plan also carries this warning: “Models indicate 30-day shelter in place followed by 180 day lifting of all mitigation results in large rebound curve — some level of mitigation will be needed until vaccines or broad community immunity is achieved for recovering communities.”

Reopening also must meet these four conditions:

>Incidence of infection is “genuinely low.”

>A “well functioning” monitoring system capable of “promptly detecting any increase in incidence” of infection.

>A public health system that is “reacting robustly” to all cases of covid-19 and has surge capacity to react to an increase in cases.

>A health system that has enough inpatient beds and staffing to rapidly scale up and deal with a surge in cases. 

In summary, plans are to reopen the country in areas that have not seen significant coronavirus penetration. Moderately penetrated areas may continue some mitigation measures as well."

The result is that people can enjoy big tax breaks stemming from only-on-paper losses, even if they enjoy big cash profits in the real world.
  
>But the use of those losses was limited by the 2017 tax-cut package. The losses could be used only to shelter the first $500,000 of a married couple’s nonbusiness income, such as capital gains from investments. Any leftover losses got rolled over to future years.  

>The new stimulus bill lifts that restriction for three years — this year, and two retroactive years — a boon for couples with more than $500,000 in annual capital gains or income from sources other than their business. That group comprises the top 1 percent of taxpayers, according to Internal Revenue Service data.

My former job was to investigate hidden conspiracies against US interests abroad.  Conspiracies are everywhere.  But most seem minor until a large one is revealed publicly.  

On a spiritual level, if you don’t believe Satanic powers are conspiring with our unrepentant desires for power or money - you may still believe that sometimes governments lie to benefits their interests.  This happens all the time.  

“If you want to believe that some secret lab created this as a biological weapon, and now everyone is covering that up, I can't stop you.”

Most diplomatic cables, and scientific evidence, points to the Wuhan Virology Lab as the source of the virus. Not the wet market. For anyone paying attention to how the Chinese Communist Party runs information domestically and internationally- it would be wise to investigate every claim that would make the CCP look bad ( including lax efforts at a bio security compound).  The WHO is strongly influenced by the Chinese government (look up the censored Hong Kong/Taiwan interview if you need a peak into this)

There is a bunch of misinformation (possibly, and I suspect mostly, disinformation) about Coronavirus being reported. Because a government only functions when people believe it has the ability to conduct proper governance.  When the government says “we have no idea how to handle this” people naturally take matters into their own hands. 

I get the “don’t fall for it” idea.  As Christians, we need to be patient, kind, and brave during crisis.   

But let’s never pretend that vile and evil conspiracies don’t exist, and we should ignore them to look prudent or above them.  Nor should we criticize those who point them out.  I remember just a year ago people saying there isn’t billionaire underage sex extortion rings run by intel agencies: then Epstein became too big to ignore.  (Looking at the Royal family involvement now)

Or that we had solid proof of chemical weapons in Iraq.  

Or that during the first Persian Gulf that Iraqi soldiers threw incubator babies on the floor.  

Or that the US would never harm our own citizens to cause conflict (See Operation Northwoods)

Or that intelligence agencies wouldn’t drug the civilian population and military with mind altering substances (see Tuskegee or MK ULTRA)

However, at the time of publication, there are actually 15 UN member states, and a clutch of other remote inhabited territories, still to report their first infection. 

The presence of some of the countries on this list, like secretive North Korea and Turkmenistan, which borders Iran, are highly dubious. These, and others, are likely to have unreported cases of coronavirus. However, according to official statistics, these are the last places without Covid-19.

The 15 countries with no confirmed cases

1. Comoros

There are currently no known cases of coronavirus in Comoros, with one doctor claiming the widespread use of anti-malarial drugs had boosted the country’s collective resilience. However, Comoros authorities have introduced a number of precautionary measures, including the suspension of all international flights until further notice. 

With only 36,000 annual arrivals, this volcanic archipelago off the east coast of Africa is one of the world’s least visited countries. The few who make it can enjoy pristine beaches and superb diving.

2. Kiribati

Some South Pacific nations have seen cases, but not yet Kiribati. As a precaution it is currently denying entry to any travellers who have been in or transited countries with confirmed local transmission within 14 days immediately prior to entering Kiribati. 

With only 6,000 annual overseas arrivals, Kiribati is one of the world’s hardest to reach, and least frequented, travel destinations. Its 33 coral atolls attract those in search of underwater wonders and complete isolation.   

3. Lesotho

Along with Comoros, Lesotho is one of only two African countries without a single reported victim of Covid-19. With a population of two million, and its neighbour South Africa experiencing thousands of confirmed cases, it seems highly likely that the virus has reached Lesotho. The parliamentary turmoil it is currently experiencing - prime minister Tom Thabane is facing allegations of murder - may also be a factor behind its apparent lack of cases. 

In normal times, Kiribati is paradise for travellers

Lesotho’s borders have been closed until at least April 21. When trips are again possible, travellers will find spectacular landscapes - high-altitude Lesotho is known as the “Kingdom in the Sky”.

4. Marshall Islands

Like Kiribati, the Marshall Islands appears to have benefited from its geographical location. Nevertheless, authorities have introduced a number of precautionary measures, including a total ban on international arrivals.

5. Federated States of Micronesia

This vast archipelago encompasses 607 islands that spread over 1,678 miles of ocean. So far, however, no coronavirus. “I sailed some years back through Micronesia and am pretty sure some of the island communities there will have no idea this is actually unfolding,” travel writer Mark Stratton, who specialises in trips to the world’s most remote corners, told us.   

6. Nauru

Around 200 tourists make it to Nauru each year, which means perhaps 15,000 living souls, or 0.0002% of the global population, have been there. So it is of little surprise that Covid-19 has not yet been detected. To keep it that way, passengers who have transited through, or have been in mainland China, Hong Kong, Macao, Iran, Italy, Korea, Europe, USA or Asia (except Taiwan) in the past 21 days, will not be allowed to enter Nauru. Everyone else will be screened and forced to self-isolate for 14 days.

7. North Korea

The secretive nation’s claim to have no cases of Covid-19 needs to be taken with a wheelbarrow of salt, given its ties with China, the source of the outbreak, and its tendency to be sparing with the truth. 

Even in normal times, travel to North Korea is not advisable. The Foreign Office warns that visitors may be arbitrarily detained, adding: “Offences that would be considered trivial in other countries can incur very severe penalties in North Korea, particularly actions the authorities deem to be disrespectful towards the North Korean leadership or government.”

8. Palau

Another coronavirus-free Pacific Island nation, Palau may be feeling thankful that China cut ties with the country in 2018, and urged its citizens not to visit, due to Palau’s diplomatic support for Taiwan. 

With no cases (allegedly), North Korea has turned its attention to firing rockets

To keep the virus out, Palau has banned travellers arriving via China, Macao or Hong Kong.

9. Samoa

One of the region’s larger nations, with a population of 198,413, Samoa has managed to keep Covid-19 at bay, at least officially. Nevertheless, a state of emergency was declared on March 20 and all international travel by plane prohibited. 

For travellers, it is in its natural beauty that Samoa really appeals. Savai’i, for example, is host to the hiking and birdwatching oasis that is Tafua Peninsula Rainforest Preserve.

10. Solomon Islands

With a population of 686,884, the Solomon Islands is considered one of the more “at risk” Pacific nations. So far, however, no cases have been reported, and since March 23 all non-citizens have been refused entry.

The Solomon realm gleams in the water as a collection of over 900 islands but only six have any real heft. Of these, Guadalcanal is the centre of life, deeply forested but also the site of the national capital Honiara, which adorns its north coast. As with Kiribati, tourist numbers are low, but there are great scuba opportunities for those keen to delve into way-out waters.

11. Tajikistan

Given its land border with China, and strong economic ties, it seems unlikely that a nation as large as Tajikistan (population: 9.1m) has managed to completely avoid coronavirus. But that is the message from the authoritarian regime of President Emomali Rahmon, who has ruled since 1992. 

In better times, Tajikistan is considered one of the best offbeat trekking destinations in the world.

12. Tonga

Tonga has also avoided Covid-19, according to official statistics, and hopes to keep it that way by closing its borders to all travellers and installing a state of emergency, including a nighttime curfew. 

Tajikistan

The nation is home to 169 outcrops, of which Tongatapu (where you find the capital Nuku’alofa) is by far the largest. Most visitors arrive here and stay here, although there is much to be said for making the short south-easterly crossing to ’Eua, which offers glorious beaches on its west shore and plunging cliffs on its east. Captain Cook paused in Tonga on his second “voyage of discovery” (in 1773), which partly explains why it was a British protectorate from 1900 to 1970.

13. Turkmenistan

Another Central Asian nation with a very vague appreciation of the benefits of transparency, Turkmenistan also claims to have no coronavirus cases. That’s despite being sandwiched between China and Iran, two of the hardest hit countries. 

Turkmenistan’s dictatorial rulers have reportedly banned face masks and outlawed discussing the virus in public, while all international flights have been grounded and land borders closed.

14. Tuvalu

The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge visited far-flung Tuvalu back in 2012, and only 2,000 tourists make it to the remote Pacific nation each year. That figure will be even smaller for 2020. 

No Covid-19 cases have been confirmed but precautionary measures are in place.

15. Vanuatu

None of Vanuatu’s 307,145 residents has tested positive for coronavirus, but it is taking no chances, with social gatherings of more than five people prohibited, and restaurants, bars and most supermarkets closing by 7.30pm each evening, and international flights suspended."

So it looks like we're starting a conversation about when things will go back to the ""new normal"", and it basically means that all social distancing standards will be in place until there's a concrete reason for them to be removed.  I really appreciate updates as information changes, because we'll never look the way we did again.

We live about 1.5 miles apart. I work at a bar/restaurant in Boston, and it is in a neighborhood where some of the highest concentrations of coronavirus are located. 

We are keeping the restaurant open for takeout and delivery to keep (most) of our staff employed and I am working most days just answering phones and taking orders. And I must say, our neighborhood is totally supporting us, and we are very thankful to our friends.

The shutdown order came on March 15. Through some stroke of luck, I was able to finagle a Saturday off on March 14. I got to spend the night with the kids and I fell asleep on the couch with my daughter. We walked to the store the morning of the 15th so I could get a newspaper, had breakfast, and their mom came to pick them up. 

I gave them a hug and a kiss, and for some reason, I felt really great about sleeping in the couch with my daughter. The shutdown order came a few hours later. I went into work Sunday evening, and I have only been able to see the kids through FaceTime since then.

I’m hopeful for a return to normal, but I know that won’t come for a long while. And I’m ok with that, because we all have to sacrifice now, and this just happens to be mine. But I miss them. I miss them so much. 

My daughter is turning 6 on the 22nd. I don’t know how I am going to deal with that.

So a full ban on all the markets wouldn’t be smart. 

Granted, I agree that these sorts of markets should be AT LEAST heavily regulated.

More of what’s currently being worked on + fast tracked!

“FDA: Human trials can begin for Emory COVID-19 antiviral”

Human clinical trials may begin on an antiviral compound which was discovered and developed by Emory University and shows promise as a potential treatment for COVID-19.

EIDD-2801 is an orally available form of a highly potent ribonucleoside analog that inhibits the replication of multiple RNA viruses including SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of COVID-19. In animal studies of two distinct coronaviruses (SARS-CoV1 and MERS), EIDD-2801 has been shown to improve pulmonary function, decrease body weight loss and reduce the amount of virus in the lung.

In addition to activity against coronaviruses, EIDD-2801, in laboratory studies, has demonstrated activity against seasonal and bird influenza, respiratory syncytial virus, chikungunya virus, Ebola virus, Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus and Eastern equine encephalitis virus. The development of EIDD-2801 has been funded in part with federal funds from the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID)

——————————

I post a lot of these medications/antivirals going into clinical trials bc I think, in my opinion, that’s our first step out of this dumpster fire. And so many intelligent people (scientists!) are working on it. 🥳

It really helps me to keep that in mind. As my pessimist of a husband with coronavirus reminds me - “whoever resolves this in any way is getting the Nobel peace prize so trust me, they’re on it.” Comforting!"

* Canadian data from virihealth.com (from PHAC & provinces), USA data from coronavirus.1point3acres.com, Other national data was from WHO sitrep 84.
* I am not an epidemiologist. I'm not a government employee. I don't even play a doctor on TV. I just like numbers.

This data is admittedly imperfect: testing is incomplete, there is a test backlog, and reporting is not completely fluid.  This is too simplistic a model for realistic projection, given all of the unknowns and variables of such a complex system.  That said, I'll continue to track this, to see where it goes.

Today's data notes:  

* MB ~~was the only province without a new case today (3rd day running)~~ **is tricksy with numbers** . PEI had a new case today after staying flat since Apr8. Nunavut continues to have none of it. 
* Nationally, 1993 are hospitalized (+71 from yesterday, a new high), and 559 are in ICU (-12 from yesterday; the high water mark is 575). As these numbers climb, the burden on our healthcare workers will increase. Godspeed and thanks to them as they stand on guard for thee and me. 
* Today, Canada's total deaths passed a threshold, with a cumulative total of 1010. It was our 2nd day in a row of 3-digit losses, with ~~101~~ **107** deaths today: 52 in QC, 51 in ON. 3.56% of known positives are deceased. This is a little high, but we've had a lot of senior care homes hit. Also, this is not really the mortality rate, since that won't be known until all those infected are recovered or not, and may vary significantly if the healthcare system is overwhelmed.
* People tested (+13,796) = 477,248 (1.27% of the population). Testing down from over 17K yesterday.
* Tested positive (+1316) = 28,379 (5.95% of those tested). The cumulative hit rate climbs slightly from 5.85% yesterday, rising 22 days in a row. The higher hit rate is concerning, particularly in QC(10.4% overall, 10.7% today) and ON (7.4% overall, 13.4% today). More testing must be done to improve confidence in the latest numbers of positives. 
* Test backlog - 7417 today, up from 5151 yesterday. 
* Recovered (+744) = 8979 (31.53% of known positives). PEI, SK, NB, NL and BC are above 50% recovered. AB was above briefly but with a number of incoming the last 3 days, has regressed to 45.8%.
* Known active = 18,390 (Total positives - recovered - deceased). The unknowns are unknown. 
* The bump in China's number @ day 29 was due to a change in the way their cases were categorized.
* The growth rate appears in cases seems to be slowing. Higher doubling time is better. March16 - doubling rate= every 2.84 days; March23=2.74 days; Mar30=4.21 days; Apr6=8.19 days. Currently over 10 days. Curve is flattening, but not flat. 
* World notes (new): France passes 15K deaths, UK/Fra with 778/762 deaths. Russia +3K to almost 25K - on pace to leapfrog 3 countries in a week to 7th most cases in Europe. Sweden passes 1K deaths (like Canada) but with only 11K known cases."

It is quite good a signal that the coronavirus was not wildly spread in other provinces.  thanks the strict lockdown of the entire Wuhan city and almost the entire Hubei province.

If you think 653 and 0 is also fake…It's easy to report a smaller number but not easy to report 0 when it's not.

In order to keep 0 death, doctors in Jiangsu even replaced one patient's lung to keep him alive.

I don't know if 3000 deaths in total is accurate. I can say 50000 confirmed cases in Wuhan is not far from the truth, 0 death in Jiangsu is a truth, the coronavirus not being wildly spread in other provinces is true, China testing quite aggressively is also true.

This was not picked up in local media.

Singapore, too, expects to go back and forth between different levels of restrictions, Lee said during the webinar, which might be the most sustainable strategy in the long run. Minimally intrusive policies, such as encouraging personal hygiene and telecommuting, are relatively easy to keep up, he noted, but it’s harder to limit the size of gatherings, cancel entertainment, and close schools and businesses for very long.

....

As Lee put it, “This is not a sprint over the next month, it’s a marathon that we do not know how long will last.”

>By comparison, only 10 percent called for the Trump administration to “stop social distancing to stimulate the economy, even if it means increasing the spread of coronavirus.” Nine percent of respondent had no opinion. 

>While the majority stretches across all ideological divides, Republicans were slightly more likely to support reopening the economy, a prospect raised by President Trump

>in recent days and dismissed by some of the nation's leading governors, some of whom have entered into regional discussions about opening businesses up in the weeks ahead.

>Further driving home Americans' priorities in the poll was a question on whether the government now has a greater responsibility to manage the virus's spread or the overall health of the economy. Seventy-five percent of respondents say  the government should focus on the virus, while 17 percent chose the economy.

>Just 37 percent say Americans should be allowed to return to work while the virus is still active.

>“Public trust in the safety of interacting with other Americans is a necessary precondition for being able to reignite the U.S. economy,” said pollster John Leer, according to Politico . “If Americans believe that their eating at restaurants or spending time in an airport jeopardizes their safety, loosening restrictions on businesses is not a sustainable economic solution.”

Yes, but the car industry worldwide gets subsidies from every country they operate in because they're a strategic industry. Propping up Holden, Ford, and Toyota created manufacturing jobs in the automobile parts industry. Having heavy industry means that you can have other heavy industry further down the line and is important so that you're not entirely dependent on the global supply chain, the negative impact of which we're experiencing now (through shortage of coronavirus test reagents, equipment, PPE, etc).

The subsidies also kept about 40K people employed in decent jobs that paid reasonably. Since the car industry departed, the vast majority of those people have worse paying jobs because full factor mobility is a bit of a lie. 

One thing that Australia *should* do, but inexplicably doesn't is manufacture farming and mining equipment (as those are things we do a lot of)."

That said, Japan just went through hanami season, where people gather to picnic under cherry trees, as well as graduation ceremonies and reopening of schools. It's like Japan let its collective guard down, masks off, sharing food and drinks. I would expect there to be a big spike in cases from that, but I also think it may not become as severe as in, say, NYC, because most people are still wearing masks, so there's less virus in the environment to be exposed to.

Of course, none of that is to say what we're facing isn't serious or that we can beat this thing without the government issuing stay-at-home orders and taking other measures."

Even if you said something like we can have 60,000 deaths, you can not wait till you have 60,000 dead then act and have the deaths stop. Keep in mind that we have been at this as a country for about a month, and we are not even at the peak and we do not know when that will be over for the first wave. Yes, there are going to be multiple waves that will hit the country and we have to be prepared for this.  So what is the purposed action, wait till 100,000 people die then we act, and accept that 300,000 people can die? Even people who say that the death toll may be less than expected, remember that this is assuming we do all we can. Our death toll is lower because we have acted. I mean 30,000 people dead is the 1/2 the death from the flu from one wave over the course of 2 months and we're not over the first wave. It took us all the effort and that many people have died.

Della Spagna non sto ad aspettare l’aggiornamento seral-notturno (ieri, peraltro, quello finale credo l’abbiano fatto dopo l’una di notte).

In Italia: +2667 casi, trecento meno di ieri e più basso incremento giornaliero dal 13 marzo; totale 165.155. Le vittime sono 21.645, di cui 578 oggi.

Continua il saliscendi in Francia, con 4560 nuovi contagi, duemila meno di ieri, per totali 147.863. Le vittime sono 17.167 (di questo passo la Francia finirà col superare la Spagna nel numero di vittime ufficiali…), di cui 1438 oggi (presumo sia una di quelle giornate in cui aggiungono in un colpo solo un sacco di decessi ‘arretrati’, come la Francia fa di tanto in tanto).

La Germania registra ad ora 1246 nuovi casi (totale 133.456) e 97 decessi (totale 3592), probabilmente ri-aggiorneranno più tardi come al solito.

Il Regno Unito registra 4603 nuovi contagi (650 meno di ieri, totale 98.476) e 761 decessi (totale 12.868).

Giornata negativa per il Belgio, che registra 2454 nuovi casi, quasi il quintuplo rispetto a ieri e massimo incremento di sempre, per totali 33.573. Ho però idea che in realtà una parte di questi nuovi casi siano “arretrati” degli ultimi giorni, quando c’era stato un calo un po’ troppo rapido dei nuovi contagi, causato forse dal rallentamento nell’attività di aggiornamento causato dalle festività pasquali. Le vittime sono 4440, di cui 283 nella giornata di oggi.

I Paesi Bassi dichiarano 734 nuovi contagi (134 meno di ieri, totale 28.153) e 189 nuovi decessi, superando ufficialmente le tremila vittime (3134).

In Svizzera si registrano 400 nuovi casi, 150 in più rispetto a ieri (totale 26.336), e 65 vittime (totale 1239).

Sempre peggio in Russia, dove 3388 nuovi contagi (seicento più di ieri e massimo incremento giornaliero) portano il totale a 24.490 casi, con 198 vittime.

In Portogallo 643 nuovi casi, 140 più di ieri, portano il totale a 18.091. 599 le vittime.

L’Austria conta invece 110 nuovi contagi, una settantina meno di ieri, per complessivi 14.336. 393 le vittime.

In Irlanda 1068 nuovi casi (230 più di ieri) portano il totale a 12.547. 444 le vittime.

Sempre peggio in Svezia, con 170 decessi nella giornata oggi (compresi verosimilmente un po’ di “arretrati” dal finesettimana), che portano il totale a 1203. I nuovi contagi dichiarati sono 482, totale 11.927.

In Polonia 380 nuovi casi (110 più di ieri) portano il totale a 7582. 286 le vittime.

La Romania conta 337 nuovi casi (una novantina più di ieri) e supera i settemila (7216), 362 le vittime.

La Norvegia registra 63 nuovi casi (il triplo rispetto a ieri), totale 6686. 142 le vittime.

La Danimarca conta 170 nuovi contagi, otto meno di ieri, per complessivi 6681. 309 le vittime.

La Repubblica Ceca registra 105 nuovi contagi (il doppio rispetto a ieri) per totali 6216. 166 le vittime.

La Serbia conta 408 nuovi casi (quasi esattamente quanti ieri) per complessivi 4873. 99 le vittime.

L’Ucraina conta 392 nuovi casi (122 più di ieri) per complessivi 3764, con 108 vittime.

In Bielorussia, 447 nuovi casi (un’ottantina più di ieri) portano il totale a 3728, con 36 vittime.

66 nuovi casi (oltre il quadruplo rispetto a ieri) in Lussemburgo, totale 3373. 69 le vittime (worldometers segna due in più da ieri? ma io mi ero segnato 69 già ieri?).

La Finlandia registra 76 nuovi casi (una ventina in meno rispetto a ieri) che portano il totale a 3237. 72 le vittime.

22 nuovi casi (tre meno di quelli di ieri) in Grecia, totale 2192. 102 le vittime.

115 nuovi casi in Moldavia, totale 2049. 46 le vittime.

Altrove, meno di 2000 casi.

""We now know from recent studies that a significant portion of individuals with coronavirus lack symptoms (“asymptomatic”) and that even those who eventually develop symptoms (“pre-symptomatic”) can transmit the virus to others before showing symptoms.  This means that the virus can spread between people interacting in close proximity—for example, speaking, coughing, or sneezing—even if those people are not exhibiting symptoms.

*my ignorance is as good as your knowledge*

* A group from Harvard including oft-cited Marc Lipsitch has published a [paper in Science](https://science.sciencemag.org/content/early/2020/04/14/science.abb5793) warning that physical distancing measures may need to be in place intermittently until at least 2022. The paper discusses impacts of climate, intermittent immunity, seasonal variation, and resurgence. It's a fairly austere assessment.

>  Absent other interventions, a key metric for the success of social distancing is whether critical care capacities are exceeded. To avoid this, prolonged or intermittent social distancing may be necessary into 2022. Additional interventions, including expanded critical care capacity and an effective therapeutic, would improve the success of intermittent distancing and hasten the acquisition of herd immunity. Longitudinal serological studies are urgently needed to determine the extent and duration of immunity to SARS-CoV-2. Even in the event of apparent elimination, SARS-CoV-2 surveillance should be maintained since a resurgence in contagion could be possible as late as 2024.

> In summary, the total incidence of COVID-19 illness over the next five years will depend critically upon whether or not it enters into regular circulation after the initial pandemic wave, which in turn depends primarily upon the duration of immunity that SARS-CoV-2 infection imparts. The intensity and timing of pandemic and post-pandemic outbreaks will depend on the time of year when widespread SARS-CoV-2 infection becomes established and, to a lesser degree, upon the magnitude of seasonal variation in transmissibility and the level of cross-immunity that exists between the betacoronaviruses. Social distancing strategies could reduce the extent to which SARS-CoV-2 infections strain health care systems. Highly-effective distancing could reduce SARS-CoV-2 incidence enough to make a strategy based on contact tracing and quarantine feasible, as in South Korea and Singapore. Less effective one-time distancing efforts may result in a prolonged single-peak epidemic, with the extent of strain on the healthcare system and the required duration of distancing depending on the effectiveness. Intermittent distancing may be required into 2022 unless critical care capacity is increased substantially or a treatment or vaccine becomes available.

* The WHO has published a [scientific brief about the BCG vaccine's](https://www.who.int/news-room/commentaries/detail/bacille-calmette-gu%C3%A9rin-\(bcg\)-vaccination-and-covid-19) potential use in this outbreak; there is, for now, no evidence. [Further analysis suggests](https://www.statnews.com/2020/04/14/decades-old-tb-vaccine-attracts-attention-and-skepticism-as-a-potential-weapon-against-covid-19/) initial modeling may be too simplistic and there's an opportunity cost to moving too quickly.

> There is no evidence that the Bacille Calmette-Guérin vaccine (BCG) protects people against infection with COVID-19 virus. In the absence of evidence, WHO does not recommend BCG vaccination for the prevention of COVID-19.

> “Suddenly everybody and their brother has found the atlas and then taken their Covid data from the WHO or from Johns Hopkins University or wherever, overlaid the two and run regression models and [said] ‘Oh, look here. BCG works,’” Pai said.

> That kind of approach is flawed, he said, and doesn’t factor in that different outbreaks around the world are at different stages... many low- and middle-income countries are not testing for Covid-19 in large numbers; their low case and death rates are more likely the result of under-reporting than of the BCG vaccine, Pai said.

> The WHO’s statement also challenged the studies attempting to draw conclusions based on countries where BCG had been used. And it, too, pointed out that a run on the vaccine could create real damage. “BCG vaccination prevents severe forms of tuberculosis in children and diversion of local supplies may result in neonates not being vaccinated, resulting in an increase of disease and deaths from tuberculosis,” the global health agency said.

* In an [early release in Emerging Infectious Diseases](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/26/7/20-0915_article), Swiss and German researchers found that WHO-recommended hand sanitizers are effective at killing the virus - not unexpected, but useful confirmation:

> They found that all sanitizer formulations and dilutions of 40% or more killed the coronavirus and reduced the virus to background levels within 30 seconds. The two WHO formulations had a virus reduction factor of >3.8, while the modified versions had a reduction factor of ≥5.9.

* Also as [an early release in EID](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/26/7/20-0885_article) is an article about findings of viral RNA (not necessarily live) on surfaces up to four meters from patients in Wuhan; this includes [air sampling](https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2020/04/study-finds-evidence-covid-19-air-hospital-surfaces) and sampling of commonly touched surfaces including shoes, computer mice, and rubbish bins:

> Almost all positive results were concentrated in the contaminated areas (ICU 54/57, 94.7%; GW 9/9, 100%); the rate of positivity was much higher for the ICU than for the GW. The rate of positivity was relatively high for floor swab samples (ICU 7/10, 70%; GW 2/13, 15.4%), perhaps because of gravity and air flow causing most virus droplets to float to the ground... the virus can be tracked all over the floor, as indicated by the 100% rate of positivity from the floor in the pharmacy, where there were no patients. Furthermore, half of the samples from the soles of the ICU medical staff shoes tested positive. We highly recommend that persons disinfect shoe soles before walking out of wards containing COVID-19 patients.

> The rate of positivity was also relatively high for the surface of the objects that were frequently touched by medical staff or patients (Tables 1, 2). The highest rates were for computer mice (ICU 6/8, 75%; GW 1/5, 20%), followed by trash cans (ICU 3/5, 60%; GW 0/8), sickbed handrails (ICU 6/14, 42.9%; GW 0/12), and doorknobs (GW 1/12, 8.3%). Sporadic positive results were obtained from sleeve cuffs and gloves of medical staff. These results suggest that medical staff should perform hand hygiene practices immediately after patient contact.

> Richard Horton, the editor-in-chief of the Lancet medical journal, wrote that Trump’s decision was “a crime against humanity… Every scientist, every health worker, every citizen must resist and rebel against this appalling betrayal of global solidarity.”

> Antonio Guterres, the UN secretary general, said it was “not the time” to cut funding or to question errors. “Once we have finally turned the page on this epidemic, there must be a time to look back fully to understand how such a disease emerged and spread its devastation so quickly across the globe, and how all those involved reacted to the crisis,” said Guterres.

> Echoing Guterres’s plea, Dr Amesh Adalja, a senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins University Center for Health Security, said the WHO did make mistakes and may need reform but that work needed to take place after the crisis had passed. “It’s not the middle of a pandemic that you do this type of thing,” he said.

> Dr Nahid Bhadelia, an infectious disease doctor and associate professor at Boston University’s school of medicine, said the cut was “an absolute disaster. WHO is a global technical partner, the platform through which sovereign countries share data/technology, our eyes on the global scope of this pandemic.”

> Lawrence Gostin, the director of the WHO centre on public health and human rights, predicted the US would ultimately lose out because other countries would step into the vacuum with increased funding. “In global health and amidst a pandemic, America will lose its voice,” said Gostin.

> “It’s a bizarre decision that would be profoundly detrimental to global public health,” said Gavin Yamey, the director of Duke University’s center for policy impact in global health. “He’s trying to distract from his own errors that have led to the worst government response to Covid-19 on Earth.”

As it stands there are 6171 confirmations of 42,763 tests performed. That means that of all those tests performed, meaning these people were hospitalized and showing symptoms of the virus, [only 14.5% *at this time* are actually positive for Corona Virus.](http://www.vdh.virginia.gov/coronavirus/)

[This virus in terms of symptoms experienced is very similar to a variety of other common illness.](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/coronavirus/symptoms-causes/syc-20479963), notably influenza. 

In summary, even now, most people with symptoms and who qualify for testing -[ which is ridiculously stringent through the VDH] (http://www.vdh.virginia.gov/coronavirus/health-professionals/vdh-updated-guidance-on-testing-for-covid-19/) - do not have the virus. While it is possible that the virus has been present in the state since prior to [the first known case on 7 March](https://imgur.com/a/0rOBfzu), there is no evidence of that being the case at present.

Further, if I were to speculate, in slightly over a month since the first case, we've identified an additional 6000 cases, and 102 separate breakouts, [most of which at Long-Term care facilities](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.dailyprogress.com/news/state/majority-of-virginias-coronavirus-outbreaks-are-in-long-term-care-facilities-5-747-cases-of/article_53ed6b48-685b-5982-a781-6bddb1da82d3.amp.html). If this virus were here since 2019 or early 2020, its likely we'd have noticed a surge of illnesses and deaths at similar facilities prior to March that would have been cause for alarm by health authorities and resident families."

>There's an unspoken social contract that the government brings prosperity in exchange for individual freedom.

To justify my degree (that I haven't used because I became a programmer), this is called ""performance legitimacy"" in international relations/studies. Like you already put so eloquently, a government derives its legitimacy by proving that it can and will continue to make citizens' lives better, which leads the citizens to trade off (ala Rousseau's 'social contract') their civil rights so long as the gravy train keeps running. 

There are a couple of problems here, though. Capitalism operates on a boom and bust cycle, or as Our Lord and Savior Bob Ross would say, ""you gotta have dark times to have good times."" This doesn't work so well for an authoritarian government that operates on performance legitimacy. And, like you say, their reaction tends to be a further clampdown on civil rights to prevent a 2nd faction from displacing them.

The United States under Nixon opened its economy to China in the early 1970s for 2 reasons: to capitalize on the Sino-Soviet Split (look it up on Wikipedia, I can't go that far in-depth) and with the hopes that they would eventually hit what's called a ""middle income trap"" that most countries get stuck at before they adopt capitalist democracies. The first was accomplished until a reversion to the 2001 Sino-Russian Friendship Treaty, and the latter has not been accomplished for what I think are two more reasons.

The first is that overall, China is still a poor country barely on the cusp of the middle-income trap, beset by staggering amounts of income inequality. Comparing a world-class city/region like Shanghai or Shenzhen to an inner rural province is startling, even when compared to the urban-rural divide in Western countries like France or the USA. The French might make fun of French Flanders and the Americans might make fun of Mississippi, but nothing compares to the divide between Shenzhen and rural China. As Bosw04k probably experienced IRL, there are a *deluge* of country peasants (nongmin) who travel back and forth between rural areas and the coast of China for work and holiday. Coronavirus in particular was crazy because it struck right before Chinese New Years, in which a lot of these migrant workers were just about to head off. 

The second is that a country like the USA pouring FDI (foreign direct investment) and aid into China has propped up an authoritarian regime through performance legitimacy. The USA has effectively given the country jobs and wealth, which justifies the CCP's existence and belays the need for (ideally democratic) reform. This is fine and dandy to offset the USSR, but it has created 21st century problems of intractable severity. Trust me, my stepmom is Chinese from Hangzhou and we're both American citizens (I'm not ethnically Han, I'm white), we both want China to become democratic and successful - but the day seems further and further away with a fascist like Xi Jinping in power. 

The US currently has an incompetent leader but I would wholeheartedly agree that a trade war is the most sensible strategy to kneecap an authoritarian regime depending on performance legitimacy. Even if it contracts the US economy by 5-10%, toppling an authoritarian regime that feels so threatened that it *polices communication via Switch games* is nothing but good for the world. My Chinese friends deserve a better government. I can't even talk to them on Animal Crossing. It's bullshit."

Muutama kappale lainauksena:

  > China acted as you’d expect. Countries that run gulags for religious minorities typically aren’t noted for their good governance and transparency. Chernobyl-type cover-ups are what they do. The purpose of the Chinese Communist Party isn’t to protect its citizens, let alone the welfare of other countries, but to do whatever seems best-suited to maintain its dictatorial grip on power at any given moment.

  > Incredibly enough, in late January, Tedros was praising Chinese officials for “the transparency they have demonstrated.” A team of experts lauded China’s response after a mid-February visit to Wuhan, contributing to Beijing’s storyline that it succeeded in containing the virus where everyone else has failed. Despite the emerging consensus that China has lied about its number of cases and deaths, and despite China’s refusal to share key information about the virus, WHO hasn’t said a discouraging word about China’s actions.

   > It’s been resolute, though, in excluding Taiwan from its workings, just as Beijing dictates. From a public health perspective, this has it exactly backward. Taiwan has proved quite adept at controlling outbreaks and got this one exactly right, in large part because it didn’t believe anything that China or the WHO said.

Eli tässäkään ei yritetä puolustella Trumpia mitenkään, vaan todetaan vain, että hänen kritiikki WHO:ta kohtaan on aiheellista, vaikka sen motiivi varmasti on itsekäs.

> Poola parlament otsustab kolmapäeval, kas võtta päevakorda kaks seaduseelnõu, mis keelaks riigis sisuliselt abordid ja seksuaalhariduse andmise koolides.

> Mõlemad eelnõud esitas parlamendi alamkoja päevakorda seimi spiiker eelmisel nädalal. Otsuses nähakse tagamõtet, kuna varasemalt on nende teemade käsitlemine toonud tänavatele meeleavaldused, kuid koroonapandeemia tõttu kehtestatud karantiini tingimustes ei saa protestimeeleavaldusi korraldada, kirjutas väljaanne Notes from Poland.

IMHO on ääretult rumal hakata kriisiga võitlemise ajal ühiskonda vaidlustega lõhki kiskuma. Poliitiline konflikt vähendab usaldust, aga usaldus võimukandjate omakasupüüdmatu tegutsemise osas on see, mis inimesed riigi soovitusi kuulda võtma paneb. Ühiskonnad, kus puudub usaldus, tulevad reeglina kriisidega palju halvemini toime.

Vastukaja on põhjust oodata küll ja veel. Ma ei imestaks, kui elanikud protestimiseks [mingi uudse nipi](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-poland-abortion-idUSKCN21W1EP?utm_campaign=trueAnthem%3A%20Trending%20Content&utm_medium=trueAnthem&utm_source=facebook&fbclid=IwAR3xwVAEu7ddSs9YnO_ooDOvZh-NOMxeW-KiciUPsBZlGdAzeBo1e0JGrnU) leiutaks.

> Aborte puudutav algatus keelaks raseduse katkestamise juhul, kui lootel avastatakse terviseprobleem, mis on üks kolmest põhjusest, mille korral katoliiklikus Poolas on seni veel lubatud aborti teha. Teised kaks põhjust on kui rasedus ohustab ema elu või rasedus on tekkinud kuriteo tagajärjel. Samas on sünnidefekt abordipõhjuseks 98 protsendil Poolas tehtud abortidest, mis tähendab, et sisuliselt keelataks sellega riigis abortide tegemine.

Mis puudutab seksuaalhariduse vastast algatust, siis see näib olevat kantud ideest, et alla 18-aastaste vahel seksi ei eksisteeri, mistõttu pole neid ka selle osas harida vaja - ja pärast õppigu ise. Minu silmis on idee umbes sama tark, kui nakkushaiguste olemasolu koolis mitte mainida. Kindlasti viiks sama kaunite ühiskondlike tagajärgedeni kah. :(

Et Poolas esitatud eelnõu läbi läheks, peab selle heaks kiitma nii Seim kui Senat. Seimis on valitsusel hetkel enamus, Senatis on asjad palju segasemad ja selget enamust pole... tundub tõenäoline, et toimuma saab palju kära ja vastuolusid, ja lõpuks kukub seadus ülinapilt läbi.

Kui aga targasti tehakse, siis lükatakse kogu asi tulevikku edasi.

Kahju, et nad selle tee nüüd ette võtma pidid."

In the earliest case, the patient became ill on 1 December 2019 and had no reported link to the seafood market, the authors report. “No epidemiological link was found between the first patient and later cases,” they state. Their data also show that, in total, 13 of the 41 cases had no link to the marketplace. “That’s a big number, 13, with no link,” says Daniel Lucey, an infectious disease specialist at Georgetown University.

If you stop to buy petrol or supplies and are contagious, you have now helped spread coronavirus to a community that may not have been heavily exposed. Even if you are extremely responsible and make literally no contact with any person or business on the way there and back there are others who will. I imagine you have seen how some people leave their filth behind at campsites, those people cannot be trusted to ensure they have zero exposure to others. Sadly the police cannot distinguish easily between the responsible and the irresponsible so everyone has to miss out.

The other problem is that 'I'm going camping' is a great bullshit excuse to travel wherever you want. Want to go see your mate at Bacchus Marsh? Just tell the highway patrol you're on the way to Lerderderg."

The new coronavirus kills by inflaming and clogging the tiny air sacs in the lungs, choking off the body’s oxygen supply until it shuts down the organs essential for life. 

But clinicians around the world are seeing evidence that suggests the virus also may be causing heart inflammation, acute kidney disease, neurological malfunction, blood clots, intestinal damage and liver problems. That development has complicated treatment for the most severe cases of covid-19, the illness caused by the virus, and makes the course of recovery less certain, they said. 

The prevalence of these effects is too great to attribute them solely to the “cytokine storm,” a powerful immune-system response that attacks the body, causing severe damage, doctors and researchers said. 

Almost half the people hospitalized because of covid-19 have blood or protein in their urine, indicating early damage to their kidneys, said Alan Kliger, a Yale University School of Medicine nephrologist who co-chairs a task force assisting dialysis patients who have covid-19."

The FDA has really lightened approval rules for COVID related medical items in order to ""cut red tape"" in an emergency. It sounds good on paper and it may come with some net positive for us all but it has also allowed capitalism to go unchecked. When capitalism goes unchecked, greed becomes the highest goal. 

With that, medical companies have been rushing items to the market without full testing or approval. That includes serum antibody testing. A lot of stuff on the market is crap and a quick way for pharmaceuticals to grab cash in an emergency.

>First, the US Food and Drug Administration relaxed its rules, and now companies can sell antibody tests without submitting validation data that shows they actually work.
The American Public Health Lab Association says that has resulted in ""crappy"" tests flooding the market.

>""It's like the wild, wild West out there -- or wild East,"" said association CEO Scott Becker, a reference to the fact that at least half the companies making these tests are in China.
Becker said that in conference call Tuesday that FDA Commissioner Dr. Stephen Hahn said antibody tests would undergo scientific review by the National Cancer Institute.

>There has been concern that some of the tests might confuse the coronavirus causing the current pandemic with one of several coronaviruses that cause the common cold.
""Lots of tests confuse the two,"" Relman said. 

>The tests would then end up telling people they had antibodies to the pandemic coronavirus when they didn't, and people might think they're immune when they're not.

>A few days after the phone call, the NAS scientists wrote a letter to the White House frankly apprising them about the quality of antibody tests.

>Results from antibody tests ""should be viewed as suspect until rigorous controls are performed and performance characteristics described, as antibody detection methods can vary considerably, and most so far have not described well-standardized controls,"" according to the letter.

Shame on Northwest Hills Pharmacy for pushing this garbage. Wait until an FDA approved antibody test is available."

There is some misunderstanding about what the test actually entails and why there are shortages. It wouldn't be 500 test kits per week used up by the NBA, it'd be about 1-3 test kits per week. A COVID-19 test kit from IDT (which is one of two manufacturers of RT-PCR probe kits for COVID-19 testing that have been functionally tested and approved by the CDC) provides enough probes for 500 samples, and costs \~$125. The rest of the reagents and machines necessary for RT-PCR are pretty common in any lab that does molecular biology. If the NBA wanted to they could probably go to a different manufacturer for the probes, which many non-approved companies are perfectly capable of accurately making, especially at the small scale needed for the NBA, and use a different lab to run the tests, thus not impacting existing testing pipelines. But also companies like IDT have significantly upscaled their manufacturing capabilities since this has started so I'm not sure if it'd really be a big deal in terms of resource allocation to just get those kits and then run them in a private lab, and it'd probably protect them from lawsuits in case of false negatives, which happen with RTPCR, even the approved kits.

Where we are really suffering is with serological test kits, which detect presence of COVID-19 antibody in the blood. This tells you if you've had prior infection, instead of just a current active infection. There are a bunch in development, but this takes more time because the current generation of tests isn't great at differentiating between COVID-19 and similar members of the coronavirus family, such as SARS or MERS. But better tests are coming, and some are already available in China, some are already available here but only to point of care workers.

I think your last point is a really good one though. You'd basically have to suspend the whole team for two weeks, which is a huge chunk of the season. I think you can definitely do some games, but its going to have to be structured very differently than the season is now."

**’I have not heard anything other’**
In a CDC telebriefing, Nancy Messonnier the director of the Center for the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, says: “Ultimately, we expect we will see community spread in this country” and “disruption to everyday life may be severe. But these are things that people need to start thinking about now.”
At a news conference in New Delhi, Trump says: “You may ask about the coronavirus, which is very well under control in our country. We have very few people with it, and the people that have it are – in all cases, I have not heard anything other.”

‘**4m tests by the end of the week’**
Former Trump homeland security adviser Tom Bossert publishes an op-ed: “It’s now or never for the US if it hopes to keep coronavirus from burning out of control.”
In an evening news conference, White House officials say the United States will have tested 1 million people that week and thereafter perform 4m tests per week. “We’ve been moving progressively to bring that test closer and closer and closer to the patient,” Azar says.
The number was false by multiple orders of magnitude. Through 12 March, the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) had completed 4,000 tests – not 4m.
10 March

**’When people need a test, they can get a test’
“When people need a test, they can get a test,” Trump says** at a White House briefing. “When the professionals need a test, when they need tests for people, they can get the test. **It’s gone really well.”**

Before the ""the press does this"" thing, I would see it online from coders who thought *everyone* should do that, because then everyone would be paid well.

This ignores *so* much about how economics works that I will just let it sit there.

Also, when I was unemployed (last time, not this thing with the Coronavirus), I did qualify for a job retraining program. The people in the industry I retrained for started laying people off, my guess is because there were suddenly too many people doing it. Also (since this was a thing the state arranged) you can only do it once. Per lifetime."

NIH and many sites have a collections of 3d print mask and accesories

[https://3dprint.nih.gov/](https://3dprint.nih.gov/)

Consider also if you have high performance filter material from air conditioners (unused of course) you can make mask from that material.

Remember that good fit and seal is as important as the mask/filter material.

Pollution mask are also very useful, the ones that cyclist use, i have a P100 from years ago with filters that can be replaced.

And last consideration, any mask, even a bandana is better than nothing. Just try to look like you are not from rdr2 robbing a bank  ;) .

How to properly wear a mask, short video.

[Donning and Doffing Facial Protection – Mask alone](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OABvzu9e-hw)

If you are going to reuse your mask (many of us will), take into consideration how to decontaminate them

[https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/ppe-strategy/decontamination-reuse-respirators.html](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/ppe-strategy/decontamination-reuse-respirators.html)

 [https://www.n95decon.org/](https://www.n95decon.org/) 

Mask, specially N95 will lose some performance on every decontamination cycle depending on the procedure used. This is because the filter media ( non woven melt blown fabric) could suffer some mechanical damage to the little fibers that makes the cloth, and also there is an electrostatic charge that gets the small particles, that could be lost on the procedure.

HEPA type filters could be reusable for longer periods of type, depends on the decontamination procedure."

I am feeling so stressed.  I read our governor (I'm in New Jersey) says that June or July is when we could return to some state of normalcy.

I am prepping for the downvotes for this but...I'm not staying in quarantine that long.  I'm just not.   I'm going to go see my friends and my family.   I'm not going to go around licking grocery store shelves or anything, but I have been in quarantine since the beginning of March.

I've mentioned this in previous comments, but I have bipolar disorder and am on FMLA from my job because this pandemic has destroyed my mental health.  My family and friends are a HUGE source of support and have been a crucial part of keeping me sane for these last 9 years since I was diagnosed.

I care about other people's physical health.  But also?  My mental health is important too.  I'm having daily panic attacks so bad that I'm vomiting.   Medication and therapy is helping only in the sense that it's keeping me from killing myself (which I guess is not nothing!).   And so if this lockdown lasts much longer, I'm going to start breaking it to spend a few hours with my loved ones.  Otherwise, I'm legitimately worried that I might have to be hospitalized.

This is just such a 180 from where I've been the last 9 years...completely stable, usually barely even remembering that I'm bipolar.  And this coronavirus and lockdown has come and completely destroyed all of that progress in a matter of weeks.  It sucks.  I'm not going to kill myself over it, but it sucks."

The virus happens to have been the pin to prick the bubble, but the problem has always been the bubble, not the pin. Even without coronavirus, we would have been staring down the barrel of the same financial predicament as what we are now, or at least something very close to it.

I believe that the current government is aware of this fact. In fact, we *know* they are, since Peters alluded to it way back in October 2017, on the night he announced his coalition partner, way before any COVID-19:

> [We] believe that an economic correction or a slowdown is looming, and that the first signs are already here... despite us having had no influence on these risks, some will attempt - when the looming dangers come - to heap the blame on us...

What this government is doing is trying to avoid a situation where we have to deal with *both* a health crisis *and* an economic one at the same time. The economic crisis is coming regardless, so we may as well ""go hard and go early"" in order to nip COVID-19 in the bud, so we can give our full attention to the economy later. Of course there will be some economic damage done in the process, but minimal compared with what was inevitable anyway. NZ is well positioned to succeed here, being a relatively isolated group of islands in the South Pacific we have a fairly big moat, and if we rid ourselves of the virus then there's a good chance we can keep it gone. 

I think ""go hard and go early"" was the right decision to take, and I have to commend the government on their handling of the coronavirus. We'll see about their handling of the economic situation however, their track record so far doesn't particularly fill me with confidence. One issue going forward is that we're in election year, and the whole thing is going to become heavily politicised.

That tweet was absolutely correct. Preliminary studies did not show clear evidence. Despite that, within days they were telling countries to **assume** it was possible anyway. And of course they provided continual updates as more information was uncovered.

> January 23rd: ""WHO declines to declare China virus outbreak a global health emergency"", despite cases in Thailand, Japan, South Korea, and US at the time. It only called it a pandemic on March 12th.

I love how you just gloss over the fact that they *did* declare it a global health emergency (in January) before it later met the definition of pandemic. 

> February 4th: Director General of WHO says widespread travel bans and restrictions not necessary to stop outbreak and could increase fear and stigma

And as Korea shows compared to the US or Italy, there was nothing incorrect about that statement. It is also consistent with their position before COVID-19."

I have tuned in to his press conferences every single day, and I made my own opinions based off the words that come out of his mouth, as opposed to what the headlines say. And I can confidently say that your mindset that the media is lying every time they criticize him is the reason that he has too much power, and the reason that we really need a better way to educate the voting population so they can’t just blindly vote off their own bullshit. I like what trump has done with the economy. I am fairly indifferent about how he approaches things like gun laws and I do agree with him on a good portion of his economic policies. That being said, he says so many racist and immature things and his entire strategy for keeping his supporters happy with him is making sure they don’t trust anyone who judges him. This is America. We are allowed to criticize our politicians. But instead of taking criticism, addressing it, and moving on, he gets stuck on it, freaks out, and demonizes it. He hates freedom of speech, unless it agrees with him, and that’s genuinely frightening.

You don’t even have to be a liberal to recognize what a horrible person he is. Is his economic approach bad? No, it’s not the worst. But he uses populist strategies (not saying he’s Hitler but that’s exactly what Hitler did and y’all are gullible enough to fall for it) to brainwash people against certain groups and rally them to him by creating a fake enemy. Wether that be Democrat’s, Mexicans, immigrants, the Chinese- he finds a way to create a sense of fear and anger in his followers so they support him. All that does is divide the country and fuel hatred and bigotry, and it’s scary.

If you’d like some unbiased examples of his incompetence, look at him screaming at reporters during his press conferences for asking him appropriate and basic questions. If you haven’t seen that, you gotta pay more attention. Look at him talking about the Charlottesville protests a few years back- he refused to condemn white supremacists after they had a rally. Once again- REFUSED. TO. CONDEMN. WHITE. SUPREMACISTS. No, that’s not from “liberal news”, I vividly remember watching that live on fox. No commentary, just his own stupidity. Watch him personally attack people on Twitter. Instead of bringing valid issues to the table with other politicians, he insults and throws fits. And most importantly, look at his incredibly delayed and horrible response to coronavirus. I’m very very happy he’s taking it seriously now and I hope he makes the right decision, but his initial response was very very slow. To try and cover that up, he created a timeline with his administration to try and make it look like they didn’t act too late- which they did, or we wouldn’t have as many cases as we do now. People make mistakes but he confirmed what a horrible person he was when he tried to cover those mistakes with lies.

If you want to insist he’s great and eat up the propaganda he’s feeding you, then be my guest. If liberals would like to read their bullshit news and attack him constantly, they look stupid too. But the moral of the story is you look just as stupid as the people who write those fake headlines. You’re buying into the same stuff, just on the other side.

Sincerely, someone who can actually do their own research."

• Abbott said it plans to distribute 4 million of the new tests by the end of this month, after an initial shipment of 1 million tests this week to U.S. customers.

They may be less opposed to the idea of leaving the WHO in general, but leaving the WHO during a pandemic - the US response has been mismanaged, shortsighted, and miscommunicated about by the POTUS - is probably where the push back comes from. It's difficult to trust Trump's leadership on anything let alone leaving a health organization in the middle of a pandemic. His argument may have been sound, but idk if his timing was great. Now, if he pulled out and said, let's use these funds to deal with the pandemic instead, that would be a more digestible response. I don't care either way. I am a Democrat, I don't like Trump, but I don't have any issue with pulling funding from the WHO."

He came in excited telling me that he was going to be our next government leader and the man barely had any good business sense. I asked how the hell he was gonna accomplish that? I mean he had a barely recognizable name in our community, other than being a small business owner, and married into said family. He let it all slip out that said family was good with the 5 large churches in our county and about a dozen other small churches and if the family greased the palms of the church pastors/leader/elders there was no way he was gonna lose, and they'd have their congregations vote for him like he was a mandate from God himself.

Sure enough, less than 12 months later, he was voted in as the commissioner for our entire county by a landslide. Then he presided over the worst economic decisions that set our community back years in terms of progress for the entire 3 - four year terms he served. I still worked for him a bit after he got elected in, and the amount of grift, stealing from taxpayers, handing out contracts to family, and friends of family (the corruption so to speak) was just astounding. He wanted me to be involved more with his political career as time went on, and less with the business as he would eventually shut that down. But with all the shit I'd seen there was no fucking way and moved on. And yet, the uninformed idiots of my community still praise him to this day regardless of his being investigated by the state for corruption multiple times during his tenure. We're still feeling the economic pains from his serving to this very day, people openly discuss how bad the decisions he made were, but still praise his fucking name. It's infuriating.

People always crow about getting involved in local politics, but unless you have that pull with the churches in a bible belt community, you aren't going to get much further than ever putting your name on a ballot. Saw a number of progressive people move to this community to try to jump start a political career just to crater their chances because they thought electorialism was still a thing.

America is fucked up from the ground up starting with local politics. I don't see any way for these southern bible belt communities to ever break this cycle, coronavirus or not."
