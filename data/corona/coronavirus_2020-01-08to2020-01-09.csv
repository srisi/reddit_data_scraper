From [Live Science](https://www.livescience.com/china-mystery-pneumonia-is-not-sars.html) it is not coronavirus (SARS or MERS), adenovirus or avian strains of influenza.  I take a total guess that it is a mutant strain of human bocavirus. We haven't heard much in ID Land about boca."

>Chinese scientists investigating a mystery illness that has sickened dozens  in central China have discovered a new strain of coronavirus, a development that will test the country’s upgraded capabilities for dealing with unfamiliar infectious diseases.  
>  
>The novel coronavirus was genetically sequenced from a sample from one patient and subsequently found in some of the others affected in the city of Wuhan, people familiar with the findings said. Chinese authorities haven’t concluded that the strain is the underlying cause of sickness in all the patients who have been isolated in Wuhan since the infection first broke out in early December, the people said."

> Some of the virus types cause less severe disease, while some - like the one that causes Middle East Respiratory Syndrome - are far more severe.

> The pneumonia outbreak started last month, and 59 cases had been reported by Chinese authorities by Sunday.

> The WHO noted that coronaviruses emerge periodically - including in 2002 to cause SARS and in 2012 to cause MERS. It said that according to Chinese authorities, the virus behind the Wuhan cases can cause severe illness in some patients and does not appear to pass easily from person to person.

A lot of people seem to be taking the possibility of an outbreak rather lightly at the moment, and don't seem to have any inclination to start protecting themselves before it's too late."

>  
>Xinhua News Agency quoted a mainland expert, Xu Jianguo, as saying that a team he is leading in analysing pathogen test results has come to the conclusion that the virus is new, and is different from Sars or Mers.

>Hong Kong has also placed almost 40 people in isolation over fears they too had the illness, although no cases have been confirmed and some people have already been discharged from hospital."
