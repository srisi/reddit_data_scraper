We cannot expect vaccines to do much better. Since immunity varies with the circumstances, consult with your veterinarian regarding specific vaccination recommendations for your pet. Some kennel facilities require a booster vaccination shortly before boarding and some veterinarians recommend a booster vaccine every six months to ensure maximum protection. 

My dogs are vaccinated for it, and most clients prefer to be vaccinated for it. Several viruses and bacteria can cause kennel cough, often at the same time. These include adenovirus type-2, parainfluenza virus, canine coronavirus, and Bordetella bronchiseptica. Your DA2PPV typically covers most of them, but still susceptible to bordetella bronchiseptica without the appropriate vaccine."

It’s endemic in shelters and multicat environments, and cats can spread it to each other. FIP itself is not contagious. Waiting 3 months won’t really do anything in this situation.

Highly recommend the SOCK FIP site if you want more info (a lot of vets seem confused about how FIP works, the research is ongoing and incomplete), it’s run by the lead FIP researcher in the world and is pretty up to date."

Rhinovirus is more likely in a healthy individual, and it causes up to 70-80% of colds.  It is also highly unlikely for a provider to screen for that or the other respiratory viruses like parainfluenza, bocavirus, coronavirus, and adenovirus in an individual that is not already immunocompromised or presents with a complex clinical history.  Usually, it is defaulted to influenza A/B and RSV only."

I am almost certain my female has the coronavirus just because of statistics and any cat I adopt will be from a shelter."
