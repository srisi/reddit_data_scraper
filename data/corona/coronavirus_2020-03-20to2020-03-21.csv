However, I think it is fair to look critically at the Chinese government. Not only have they failed to properly regulate food markets in China (which is likely the cause of this coronavirus as well as past dangerous viruses like SARS), but they also downplayed the severity of this virus for over a month. 

I’m ready for downvotes calling me racist. But I’ll reiterate- Asian people are not to blame AT ALL. But the Chinese government is to blame- not because they are Asian, but because authoritarian systems of government are dangerous- Chinese officials knew the severity of this virus long before they spoke out... and lower level officials were afraid to speak out because they were afraid of backlash from higher up officials."

Many of the warnings had made their way into daily briefing papers from the Office of the Director of National Intelligence and the CIA by late January and early February. While the agencies didn’t predict that the virus would land in the U.S., the reports tracked the virus’ spread in China and other countries and warned that China might be minimizing the damage of the coronavirus. Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar reportedly couldn’t speak to Trump about the virus until a Jan. 18 call. During the conversation, Trump reportedly interrupted Azar to ask about vaping. “Donald Trump may not have been expecting this, but a lot of other people in the government were—they just couldn’t get him to do anything about it,” one official told the newspaper. “The system was blinking red.”

Our intelligence agencies didn't predict it would land in the U.S.? So are they incompetent.... Or is their actual prediction classified? Because whatever they told the Senate.... It made them dump their stocks....."

This patient had gone on spring break and come back with a cough and shortness of breath so bad he could barely walk across a room. I am very concerned that younger people look at the mortality numbers from the WHO (0.2%) and not realize they are susceptible too. Sure, they may only die at 0.2%, but they are susceptible to hospitalization, ICU admission. 

14-20% of patients 20-44 needed hospitalization from a CDC report that recently came out. Sure we may be able to keep these people alive 0.2% of the time, but is that really the best way to measure risk? I want to emphasize this because it’s important for young people to do their part with social distancing.

I am also very concerned about what will happen because of spring break. I think there have been reports of younger people ignoring social distancing recommendations and then potentially returning home from vacations and spreading COVID.

Just last Saturday, a digital health thermometer company, Kinsa, showed data that indicated an unusual rise in fevers in South Florida, even though it's not a known Covid-19 cluster. Our worry: is this because of spring breakers? The elderly? A local cluster in Florida? The fear is that this will be a potential new spreading cluster with people flying back from spring break into their homes and igniting thousands of smaller cluster across the USA. Keep in mind that the South Korean outbreak can almost solely be attributed to a single person (Patinet #31) who did not self quarantine, then went to church and buffets while positive with COVID. Please, please let's do our part to not be that patient.

**TL;DR: Please don’t be our patient #31. Self isolate, especially if you’re young and healthy.**

U pitanju je [lek za maleriju iz 1944, Chloroquine](https://www.zmescience.com/science/anti-malaria-covid-19-0523/), od koga 70% ugrozenih ozdravi za 6 dana. Drzave koje su testirale lek uspesno i primenjuju ga na pacijentima: Kina, Juzna Koreja, Francuska, Nemacka, Holandija. Nije nikakva ""fejsbuk i viber"" vest vec prava i proverena, proverite na svim naucnim i medicinskim portalima kao i na mainstream medijima. E sad, drzave i predsednici NE SMEJU da obaveste narod da je lek pronadjen i korona pobedjena da se ljudi ne bi previse opustili i krenuli da se okupljaju jer je sledece 3-4 nedelje kriticno. Takodje lek ne pobedjuje korona virus nego pomaze imunom sistemu da se lakse nosi sa virusom. Isto kao sto se bogati pojedinci zarazenim od korone lece lekovima za AIDS.

Zanimljivo je da je [Elon Musk pre 4 dana tvitovao](https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1239650597906898947?lang=en) o ovom leku da moze biti resenje i sherovao je google doc fajl nacuni rad koji je uploadovan od strane naucnika da bi ostale Vlade mogle da pristupe.

Trump juce izlazi pred medije i govori da je ovaj lek veoma obecavajuci i americka drugs administracija je krenula u testiranje istog. Svaka drzava mora da testira sama lek pre nego sto ga da svojim gradjanima. [Australija je trenutno u testiranju](https://asiatimes.com/2020/03/australia-lab-to-human-test-reputed-covid-19-cure/) i rezultati su pozitivni i obecavajuci, i ko zna koliko jos drzava. Koja je politika kurva, pogotovo u Americi, pokazuje cinjenica da anti-Trump mediji koriste ovo da seru po leku kako bi naudili Trumpu, sto je meni neverovatno, da se sve stvari pa cak i ovakve koriste u politicke borbe.  Krenimo redom:

NY Post: [Anti-malaria, potential coronavirus drug chloroquine can be lethal to children](https://nypost.com/2020/03/20/anti-malaria-potential-coronavirus-drug-chloroquine-can-be-lethal-to-children/) \- Trump bad amrite? Vest govori da neki roditelji tvrde da je njihovo dete davne 1983 popilo neki lek iz fioke i umrlo i tvrde da je od tog leka. I to je dovoljno za novinski clanak? Ali steta je nacinjena, kada guglate ovaj lek na prvoj stranici izlazi rezultat da od njega umiru deca. Sto je opet glupost sama po sebi, nemoj decu leciti sa tim i resen problem.

NY Times: [With Minimal Evidence, Trump Asks F.D.A. to Study Malaria Drugs for Coronavirus](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/19/health/coronavirus-drugs-chloroquine.html) \- Trump bad. Nema dovoljno dokaza da pokrene.... test? Cekaj kako bez dokaza da testiras, pa sta je onda test ako ne akcija zarad skupljanja dokaza? A u ostatku teksta pise da u Kini, Juznoj Koreji i Francuskoj je testirano uspesno. Nema veze, los naslov je napravljen, steta Trumpu je nacinjena.

Najvece farmaceutske kompanije koje proizvode ovaj lek vec dobijaju po 5% dnevno na berzi, medju njima i [Nemacki Bayer koji je vec poslao 3 miliona ovih lekova](https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/03/18/bayer-is-donating-its-malaria-drug-that-could-help.aspx) kao donaciju. Donacija je sigurno biznis potez da Trump nastavi da kupuje lek od njih. Nemacki Bayer izdao saopstenje da su krenuli u masovnu proizvodnju leka, [kao i ostali pharma velikani](https://www.statnews.com/pharmalot/2020/03/19/teva-mylan-coronavirus-covid19-malaria/).

&#x200B;

Zakljucak: sa ovim lekom cemo pobediti koronu, ali to ne znaci da i dalje necemo biti zarazeni, da nece biti ljudi po bolnicama, ne znaci da ne treba da budemo obazrivi. Bilo je prognoza da ce sve ove blokade trajati 6, 9 ili 12  meseci, ali sa ovim lekom nam je sad jasno da toga nece biti, i da necemo totalno ekonomski propasti. Koliko ce sad sve ovo trajati sa pojavom ovog leka - ne znam, mozda 4, mozda 8 nedelja, ali sigurno cemo se brze vratiti na poslove i stvari ce se vratiti u normalu."

We need to protect our front line health care workers with the right gear! If you known if anyone with masks and gloves like painters and such, please see if they can donate to local hospital. 

I’m going to be on the front lines soon. I work inpatient medicine. 
I will proudly treat all my patients and go into work doing the best I can to save all my patients. Please please don’t make our jobs harder. Please stay at home so we can do our jobs at work. I chose what I do knowing it would be hard. I’m not backing down now. But please let us help you by you helping us. 

If you are sick with shortness of breath, cough, fever and even stomach ache and diarrhea call your doctor and local health department. 10% symptoms can be stomach related. Don’t go to the ER and get tested. Go to ER if you have a fever of 100.0 that is not going away, increasing shortness of breath, chest pain. 
Ask to be tested for the flu. There is low coInfecting rates, so if you have the flu, you likely don’t have covid-19. If you have just plain old coronavirus virus you probably don’t have the covid-19 strain either. 
It’s in the community now. Make sure they just aren’t asking if you traveled. Make sure you tell them if you have contact with anyone that might have tested positive. 
And if you have to go to hospitals - when you call 911 or go to the ER, please give heads up it’s for covid 19 so healthcare and have the right gear for you and them! 

Not that Colton meant for this. But seeing who is getting tested in the US is showing me just who has the  privilege around here."

2020-03-20,duckcowman,australia,22,https://www.reddit.com/r/australia/comments/flohsi/coronavirus_schools_to_remain_open_across/fkzsn5v/,"The number of cases in Australia is increasing rapidly, as can be [seen here](https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/country/australia/).

[Hundreds of other countries](https://i.imgur.com/noaWwCx.png) have already shut down their schools to prevent the spread, and we are just now learning of [cases within schools in Australia](https://old.reddit.com/r/australia/comments/flmawv/adelaide_student_tests_positive_for_covid19_after/).

The government is using Singapore to justify keeping the schools open, but they are closely monitoring kids and taking their temperatures twice a day. To my knowledge nothing like that is being done here and I haven't heard a single compelling reason to keep the schools open.

‘Medical staff will have to stay home to look after their kids’ is the main argument being used, but it means we will have more healthy people to look after the sick when things get worse. In a couple of weeks a lot more medical staff will be sick and unable to work if we don’t have rosters/planned isolation already in place. ‘Other workers will have to take leave to look after their kids’ applies to more people, but in the case of high school kids this shouldn’t be an issue as they should be able to look after themselves for a few hours. For younger kids, a lot of them will have older siblings to look after them, or other family members who don’t work. It’s not ideal but we are going to reach this point eventually so why not start figuring it out now. I don’t think most people realise how serious this is going to get.

Soon our number of critical cases will far outweigh what our healthcare systems can handle unless we start taking drastic action to flatten the curve.

Australia is not being proactive and is one of the slowest countries to put preventative measures in place, which means more deaths will occur. There are a large number of countries with only a handful of cases that have already closed their schools because they are the perfect places to spread the virus. We are being incredibly short-sighted and will pay for it dearly.

Kurzgesagt have just put out a [very informative video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BtN-goy9VOY) explaining why it is so important to flatten the curve, which means taking action sooner rather than later. Please start planning what you are going to do with your family now and keep your kids at home if you are able to because things are going to get bad very quickly."

I'm older than most of the DT, and my parents are elderly.  Ever since coronavirus went global I've been very worried that I might get that sudden phone call from home (especially since I just moved away from Northern Italy, and have had news from people I know there).  Today I got it...not quite my greatest fears, but still bad.  My dad was suddenly hospitalized and will need heart surgery, and because of the quarantine the rest of my family isn't allowed near the hospital.  My dad doesn't even have a cell phone.  I live 5000 miles away.  It's better than a coronavirus diagnosis (probably), but still an abysmal scenario.  My mom has high blood pressure and anxiety issues and I'm terrified of this ordeal pushing her over the edge as well.

I don't think there's any kind of ping yet for people whose family are going through a health crisis right now, but if there were I would be grateful for the support of this community.  I recently moved to a new country and I have no friends here except my SO, so as dumb as it might sound to some of you, the DT means a lot to me.

In the absence of another group I'm going to !ping CHRISTIAN because I appreciate prayers in this very difficult time for my family.  If anyone else is going through serious hardship during this crisis, whether it's you or family or friends, let me know and maybe we can get some kind of support ping going, to help each other through this.

I know it's a cliche.  But tell your friends and family that you love them."

Those nations were:

* Prepared, after the SARS outbreak last time. They don't have issues with mask shortages like we do, for instance
* Have collectivist cultures that are far more willing to cooperate/obey the authorities (\#SpringBreak2020 isn't a fucking thing)
* Have a very strong and robust ability to control/shut down society when needed or don't have the same notions of civil rights we do (like forced screenings of people)

Do you remember #flattenthecurve? One of the things that happens in crisis is that valuable supplies, or sometimes even things that have no trouble going around, predictably become scarce because of hoarding/overuse. That means people buy all that they can get their hands on and then it just sits on a shelf somewhere. This goes for hospital ICU beds, toilet paper (are you really using all that toilet paper?), and also for personal protective equipment (PPE) and masks. One of the things we are seeing was that hospitals themselves can’t purchase any PPE because so many people, both government, hospitals, and regular folks are buying masks.

This is because masks work. Of course they do. There is ample evidence that the virus is transmitted by airborne droplets (NEJM report below) and that masks of all types do prevent infections. 

However the mask situation is like the toilet paper situation. When everyone tries to buy toilet paper at once, there is no toilet paper left. That is a peak in the curve. But when everyone buys TP at a slow regular pace, there is usually enough to go around. That is a peak that can hopefully be flattened.

Now imagine that same situation for those of us in healthcare. If everyone buys masks at the same time, then the masks are like your TP—nothing left. This means the nurses taking care of coronavirus patients don’t have masks, which means they will get sick. What happens if there are no doctors, nurses, PAs, NPs, environmental services personnel, or other staff left to take care of the sick, and we are all ill? Essentially, there won’t be any of us available to treat you when you do.  Thus the need to leave masks for healthcare workers. [We talked about it over here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/flvu7k/im_ali_raja_md_and_shuhan_he_md_emergency/fl1bm3y/): 

**TL;DR: Wear a mask, but a homemade one if you can. Please save us the reusable N95's, or we might have a shortage of doctors & nurses if/when you get it.**

Dr. Glanville: 3 to 4 weeks before completing engineering on drug that neutralizes coronavirus

Distributed Bio president Dr. Jacob Glanville on efforts to combat COVID-19.

Distributed Bio co-founder and CEO Dr. Jacob Glanville revealed on ""The Story with Martha MacCallum"" Thursday that his company's laboratory is three to four weeks away from engineering a therapeutic antibody to combat the coronavirus.

""What my company is doing is adapting antibodies to recognize and neutralize the novel coronavirus. So this would ... [be] sort of skipping what a vaccine does,"" Glanville said. ""Instead of giving you a vaccine and waiting for it to produce an immune response, we just give you those antibodies right away. And so within about 20 minutes, that patient has the ability to neutralize the virus.""

Glanville told MacCallum that once his colleagues are done engineering the antibodies they will send it to the U.S. military before eventually conducting a human study this summer.

""The completed drug is going to go to the USAMRIID [United States Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases]. So that's the U.S. military and they're gonna be testing it for its ability to neutralize the virus.

""At the same time, that drug was going to go to Charles River Laboratories, which is a international contract research group, which is going to test the safety of that drug,"" Glanville said. ""Both of those pieces of information come together so that we can produce batches, go through some red tape, and then do the first human studies that we'll do on 200 to 600 people in the summer, probably in July.""

Glanville said that he believes ""social distancing"" is working to reduce the spread of the virus, but that medicine is needed to further combat the spread.

""It is definitely helping. We are way safer now than we were a week ago. The social distancing measures slow down the growth of new cases. But the problem is, eventually people have to go back to work. And the coronavirus appears so infectious that we we don't think we're actually gonna be able to just squish out the pandemic just through social distancing,"" Glanville said. ""So eventually we're gonna need medicine because otherwise all the models I'm looking at are guessing that this thing's going to last all year and it could indeed become seasonal with everybody eventually becoming infected.""

Glanville added that the U.S. is on a ""different trajectory than Italy,"" where the number of recorded deaths from the virus surpassed China earlier Thursday, but he also warned that hospitals will be stressed by the coronavirus.

""Our medical care is excellent. That said, this thing is really infectious and it's growing. So we are going to see stress on our hospitals and our ICUs throughout the nation,"" Glanville said. ""And that's part of the reason why the White House made such a strong decision to go institute these these isolation measures."""

**First,** I think its important for people to remember that we’re treating patients here in the Emergency Department for COVID, but we’re also here for all your other emergency medical needs as well /u/ashley_oc . We still see patients with strokes, heart attacks, gunshot wounds, car accidents, blood clots, and all the things that people regularly have, which are quite deadly in themselves. My biggest fear during all this is that someone with shortness of breath will test negative for coronavirus but then be found days later to have a severe pulmonary embolism that was passed over because we were only focusing on COVID. Its important for people who need care to come to the ER, that’s why we’re here. We’re the front door of the hospital - that’s our mission.  The reason that we became emergency physicians was so we could offer that care 24/7/365. We hope to make sure that the message gets out that we’re still here for people, even (especially!) for non-COVID related concerns.

**Second:** the dividing line for when we have told people to come to the ER has and continues to be based on symptoms: If you are having a hard time breathing or feel awful, call you doctor or, if you can’t get a hold of them, come to the ER. We’ve had patients with home oxygen monitors who have noticed that their numbers drop into the 80s (normal is above 95%) when they walk around at home and feel short of breath.  That is something we’d normally only see when you’re ill or at a very high altitude like climbing Mt. Kilimanjaro. While most people probably don’t need a home O2 monitor, we should all listen to our bodies, because our symptoms can often correlate with vital signs (like our blood pressure or oxygen saturation). If you feel short of breath while doing your day to day activities, I think that's the time to come in.

**TL;DR: Come in when you feel short of breath. It could be a reason to admit you for COVID, or it could be something else that’s dangerous. We don’t know until we see you.**"

1. She was not privy to the information as she did not attend the briefings on Jan 24th.

2. She did not make the transactions, her husband did. 

3. She did not come out and lie to the American people and try to assure them things were fine while secretly moving money out.

    ""Under Senate rules I report my husband's financial transactions,"" she wrote. ""I have no input into his decisions. My husband in January and February sold shares of a cancer therapy company.

The masks have to be replaced each time the physician enters/leaves a room or they really aren't effective at all - in fact the most useful aspect of masks (particularly non-N95 ones like the construction masks or surgical masks I've seen people taking to wearing in public) is to prevent people wearing them from spreading any infection they may potentially have.

Sisolak said the state has made “countless calls” to ask and “even beg” for more testing materials, but the government has no guidance for when the backlog will be cleared.

In the meantime, Sisolak is responding with a new emergency order taking previous guidance for non-essential businesses to close, and now making it mandatory. 

“I am not asking them anymore,” he said. “I am telling them they must close their doors.”

Coronavirus bungling by White House is now 'too late to be fixed,' Obama's Ebola czar says

Suzanne Smalley
March 20, 2020, 9:52 AM EDT

WASHINGTON — The delay by the administration in making coronavirus tests available is a problem that is now “too late to be fixed,” Ron Klain, who handled the 2014 Ebola crisis for former President Barack Obama’s administration, told Yahoo News in a wide-ranging interview this week. Klain said that while President Trump has fumbled several aspects of the federal government’s coronavirus response, he expects the shortage of tests in the United States to be one of the most enduring legacies of the crisis.

“The No. 1 thing that people will flag from day one, where the administration has just totally dropped the ball,” is testing, Klain said on the Yahoo News “Skullduggery” podcast. “Because the main purpose of testing in January, in February, was to identify where the disease was and isolate it before it spread wildly. Now it’s spread.”

Klain was chief of staff to former Vice President Joe Biden and is now a senior adviser to Biden’s presidential campaign. Maintaining that his criticisms are not motivated by politics, he singled out Republican governors Mike DeWine of Ohio, Larry Hogan of Maryland and Charlie Baker of Massachusetts for their deft and proactive responses to the coronavirus.

“Calling out the Trump administration failures is not politicizing it,” Klain said. “It is a demand for action to save lives.”

The virus’s spread will cost thousands of American lives and will inflict long-term damage on the economy, Klain said. And there is no clear indication that the number of tests available in the U.S. will ramp up anytime soon.

“The testing problem has not been fixed,” he said. “It’s not just that we were promised a million tests three weeks ago and we’re still at probably fewer than 100,000. It’s not just that we were promised 1.4 million tests last week, and we’re still at fewer than 100,000. It’s that even as we are talking today, we are still at fewer than 100,000.”

And with a few exceptions, only celebrities and well-connected leaders have easily procured tests so far. “You can’t get a test unless you’re an NBA player or a movie star or a member of Congress,” Klain said. “That is the reality.” He said the administration’s decision not to use a test provided by the World Health Organization is indefensible, particularly since almost every other country is relying on the WHO test, and “they’re doing a better job of controlling this disease than we are.”

Klain said the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s subsequent failure to quickly create its own test only exacerbated the problem and further exposed the administration’s incompetence.

“As all this was unfolding in January, in February, President Trump resisted the demands that he put someone in charge at the White House,” Klain told “Skullduggery” hosts Michael Isikoff and Daniel Klaidman. “He at first had no one in charge at all. Then he put Alex Azar in charge, in just one Cabinet department.” 

Even with Vice President Mike Pence now spearheading the administration’s response to COVID-19, Klain said it is still unclear who is in charge since Trump’s son-in-law, Jared Kushner, has taken over a task force to get private sector testing launched “even as the public sector testing can’t get the supplies, can’t get the reagents, can’t get the chemicals.”

“This is still an ongoing mess,” Klain said. “It needs organization, it needs direction and it needs prioritization. And finally, what it needs, really, is accountability. We don’t really know how many people are being tested each day, we don’t know where the gaps are. That’s not being reported by the Centers for Disease Control on a real-time basis, and you can’t fix a problem if you can’t measure a problem.”

Klain published a scathing op-ed in the Washington Post in January laying out what he believed the administration needed to do to have a shot at avoiding the current crisis. He also testified before Congress in February to repeat his call for a single White House czar to lead the administration’s response. 

While Klain said the incompetence of the administration is “bad enough,” he is even more distressed that “the president of the United States, until a few days ago, was up there saying this isn’t a problem. Just a couple of weeks ago, he said there are only 15 cases, they’re all going away, [and] that the travel restrictions on China had sealed the country up tight.”

Klain said that while he was Ebola czar, even with Obama demanding answers, it was still “difficult to get the bureaucracy to do the right thing.”

“If you have a president saying to people, ‘This isn’t a problem,’ if you have a president sidelining scientists who speak out and say it’s a problem, and this president did, then it is absolutely impossible to get the bureaucracy ... to do the right thing because inertia is the default setting,” Klain continued. “And when you add to that inertia a discouragement of action, a suppression of truth, you are going to go from inaction to even what’s worse than inaction, and that’s what we saw here.”

Ebola, a hemorrhagic fever that originated in Africa, was almost entirely controlled in the United States, accounting for just a handful of cases, none by community spread. 

Trump, a private citizen at the time, tweeted about Ebola more than 100 times in 2014, denouncing the administration’s handling as criminally incompetent.

The administration continues to fumble its response, said Klain, citing the CDC’s guidance to doctors this week to use bandannas as masks when seeing patients, since many hospitals have run out of masks.

“How long can we put up with this?” he asked. “This is a social science experiment with life or death consequences that we’re running in real time in the United States.”

A day after Trump stirred controversy by pointedly calling the coronavirus a “Chinese virus,” Klain also said the administration’s initial obsequiousness toward the country is a glaring contradiction. On Jan. 24, Trump tweeted praise for the Chinese response and transparency in controlling the virus, Klain said, even though the Chinese wouldn’t allow American scientists access to data they needed to better understand the virus.

“President Trump was slathering the praise on President Xi even as President Xi was denying access,” Klain said. “So now that this has gone out of control, now, when it’s too late, President Trump all of a sudden has found his voice and is blaming China.”

Klain singled out former White House national security adviser John Bolton’s 2018 decision to close the National Security Council office responsible for responses to pandemics as an especially damning indictment of the administration. Klain recommended creating the office after he led the Ebola fight for Obama. He said it was clear to him then that the United States needed to be “prepared for the next one.”

“We knew this day was coming,” he said. “We didn’t know when and where, but we knew it was coming. And President Obama put in place a structured plan for it.”

Trump initially kept the NSC’s pandemic response unit, but later allowed Bolton to disband it.

“There is no question in my mind that we were less prepared for this and responded less quickly because there was no one at the White House after the summer of 2018 in charge of preparing for and planning for this response,” Klain said. “The president made a conscious decision with John Bolton to de-prepare the country from where we were, and to disband the unit that was getting us ready.”"

Meanwhile the shift away from driving and towards alternatives like bicycling and resulted in 1330 fewer collisions and 228 fewer motor vehicle injuries.

So -228 and +24 - that's a tradeoff I'll take any day of the week.  And the 1330 motor vehicle collisions avoided takes a certain load off the first responder and police systems, even if there are not injuries involved  in many of them.

Also many people are cycling instead of taking public transit, which means that the public transit facilities are less crowded.  Bicycle travel is generally a good choice from the perspective of social distancing and thus it is benefiting those who travel by bicycle rather than by public transit.  But reducing the number of people using public transit right now is also better & safer from the perspective of the remaining public transit users, many of whom are older, disabled, etc and just don't have the option  to bicycle.

In short, the (relatively) few additional bicycle injuries are a good reason to call for better, safer bicycle infrastructure and facilities but they are definitely *not* a good reason to discourage bicycling as part of the coronavirus response.

In fact the vastly lower number of injuries in comparison to the alternatives and the potential to reduce virus spread in comparison with other transportation options is a positive reason to *encourage* more bicycling during the pandemic conditions, not discourage [it.](https://it.As)

As with everything, there are tradeoffs but the negatives are quite small and the benefits quite large in comparison."

“Next few streams - RE: COVID19

Hi all!

I wanted to post here so we can explain things in more detail than a tweet would allow, but last night following some internal decisions with Yogscast and Fourth Floor, the HighRollers team have decided to try and minimise our travel and self-isolate due to the current pandemic of COVID19 (Coronavirus). We're doing this because not only is there a risk to ourselves, but everyone we might come in contact with, even if we don't show any symptoms. This is a very serious global health issue, with statements from the WHO and many other medical institutions suggesting that self-isolation is a key strategy to help reduce spreading the virus.

What this means is that this weeks stream (Sunday 15th of March) will likely be replaced by something else (Tom and Rhi causing chaos I'm sure) and then the following weeks (22nd and 29th) we'll be attempting to use Roll20 and Video software to stream HighRollers from home so we don't miss out on the inevitable descent into ruin... I mean ADVENTURES of the Aerois gang. :)

This solution won't be perfect. Not everyone has a mega-hype stream setup at home. The software has slight delays and audio might be messy, no cool maps etc. But it's the best practical solution right now. It also may need to last longer than those weeks, but we're going to play it by ear and see.

We hope you understand the situation and thank you for your patience as we work out the best solutions. With luck we'll be back around a table in no-time! :)

With love and appreciation,

Mark & the HighRollers Team.”"

By Dan Petrella, Gregory Pratt, Stacy St. Clair and Jamie Munks
Chicago Tribune |

Mar 20, 2020

Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker plans to issue a “shelter-in-place” order for the entire state starting Saturday, essentially commanding residents to stay in their homes as the officials take drastic measures to slow the spread of the coronavirus, sources told the Tribune.

Pritzker is expected to announce the directive at a 3 p.m. Friday news conference along with Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot. Details are still being worked out, sources said.

Residents can still go to the grocery stores, put gas in their cars, take walks outside and make pharmacy runs. All local roads, including the interstate highways and tollways, will remain open to traffic, as well.

What Is This?

 U.S. Cardiologist: It's Like a Pressure Wash for Your Insides
Illinois will be the second state to impose a shelter-in-place directive, after California Gov. Gavin Newsom issued one Thursday night. The San Francisco area was placed under one Tuesday.

New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio also has told his residents to prepare for a possible order, though New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo dismissed the idea, saying his previous edicts are akin to a lockdown without the panic-inciting language.

Suburban Oak Park also issued a “shelter-in-place” order as of 12:01 a.m. Friday, after two emergency room physicians at Rush Oak Park Hospital tested positive for COVID-19. Residents have been ordered to stay in their homes except for “essential” travel as outlined by village ordinance. They can go to work, for example, if their businesses remain open, especially if they have essential jobs such as first responders, sanitation workers or health-care providers.

Pritzker laid down the groundwork for a potential order Thursday, telling parents to prepare for the statewide school closure to extend past March 30. Though the governor acknowledged he has discussed imposing more stringent rules on the general public, he said that no matter what he decides, interstate highways, gas stations, grocery stores and pharmacies would remain open.

“There is no need to run out and hoard food, gas and medicine,"" the governor said Thursday. ""Buy what you need within reason. There is enough to go around, as long as you do not hoard.”

Though the governor activated the Illinois National Guard earlier this week to help combat the virus, the service members will have no role in enforcing any potential order. Instead, 60 service members will be deployed to establish drive-up testing sites, help with food delivery to disadvantaged families impacted by school closures and possibly prepare closed hospitals to reopen.

The vast majority of currently activated troops are health-care professionals – doctors, nurses, medical technicians – who would not be tapped for an law-enforcement assignment.

“We have never even discussed a quarantine mission for the Illinois National Guard,” Leighton said. “It’s never come up.”

Leighton said he understands anxieties are high amid the pandemic, but the Guard is not the boogeyman.

“We are your friends, neighbors and co-workers,” he said. “We’re fellow worshippers at your church, synagogue, mosque or wherever you worship. We are part of the community. We are you. We are not going to invade Chicago. We are here to help.”

While the specifics for a shelter-in-place order might be different if one is issued here, San Francisco provides an idea of what the rules could look like.

In the San Francisco area, six counties are on lockdown until at least April 7, with only people with essential jobs or government functions allowed to work outside their homes.

Jobs deemed essential there include: Health-care workers, grocery store employees, pharmacists, hardware store workers, plumbers, electricians, day care providers, bank tellers and roles that are essential to a business’ operations such as payroll and security. Police, firefighters, paramedics and sanitation workers also are be quarantined."

Making cheap goods there is NOT worth all the costs we are dealing with on them:

* They undercut and steal our technology and systems, often threatening our national security. For what? A cheaper iPhone? 
* They profit off our relationship and threaten our allies. We're indirectly funding their geopolitical ambitions
* They have a corrupt government that lies and steals from its people, and their authoritarian system is being spread as an alternative to Western democracy and human rights
* They don't play by international rules or norms

The whole coronavirus situation is ultimately a great example of the limits I now have with regard to globalization and freedom of movement. 

A nation like China, with corrupt bureaucrats (I know everyone talks about watching *Chernobyl* and I think it's important to point out the same corrupt bureaucratic attitude to please party bosses exists in China and other communist countries, it's a big problem):

* Lied about the outbreak early on to hide the reality of it
* Barred outside medical experts/epidemiologists from investigating
* Continued to allow citizens to leave and visit other countries and spread the disease
* Instituted a massive shut down without warning others about how sever it was
* By the time other nations could respond, it was too late
* Now they are trying to revise history and make it look like they're the good guys with this garbage like ""China bought you guys 2 months"" and ""China is providing masks and tests and doctors!"" when their own management of the situation fucked it all up

Ironically, Trump's ban on Chinese travel probably delayed the US from what Spain and Italy got earlier. Had we shut down travel with Europe earlier, we probably would have fewer cases and bought more time - but he's bungled so much."

At some point we must consider the effects of self-isolation on society and the economy.

 I'm wondering if anyone informed on the subject can comment: What would be wrong with a government directive mandating that the high-risk, and elderly population self quarantine, and provide ample assistance to them during this time. The rest of the population goes about their lives as normal. 

The hospital rush problem occurs when too many of these patients get sick at one time. Hospitals are not becoming overrun with coronavirus patients who don't have any type of pre-existing conditions (yes, there are a few outliers)."

>The director of the center, José Manuel Sampedro, appeared this Wednesday in various media outlets to denounce an alleged situation of ""abandonment"" by the Administration, forcing staff to care for residents in ""triple shifts"" and even work ""with fever"".

>[However t]he regional government confirmed the presence of public health care workers in the residence since it learned about [its] state, reveals that the center does not have any doctor on payroll and that employees had been working without protective equipment until the regional government provided them with it.

>CIUDAD REAL.- Fifteen elderly people from the private residence managed by the Elder Foundation in Ciudad Real province's town of Tomelloso have died in recent days, some of them in the center itself - which houses about 170 elderly people - and others in the hospital after their positives for coronavirus COVID-19 were confirmed.

>According to the account of the situation made by its director José Manuel Sampedro -son of the foundation's president, Ramón Sampedro-, a couple of weeks ago five elderly people presented symptoms of coronavirus, so they were transferred to Tomelloso Hospital, where they were tested positive and were admitted. Four of them died days later in the hospital.

>But the advance of the virus in the nursing home did not stop there, since last Saturday, March 14, four other residents died in the center, which, according to Sampedro in statements to various media, also presented the symptoms of coronavirus.

>These eight deceased residents have been joined in the last four days by four other deaths of elderly people in the center, who also had symptoms of COVID-19, although they had not been tested, according to the director.

>And it is that according to his version, of the total of residents, about thirty would be isolated in their rooms for possible coronavirus, while about twenty workers would be quarantined in their homes, also presenting symptoms of coronavirus.

>The [only] person who acually submitted to the test and tested positive was José Manuel Sampedro himself, as he himself stated.

>A situation he denounced to the press this wednesday, demanding ""urgent attention"" from health authorities and claiming to feel ""psychologically devastated"" by being ""overwhelmed"", lacking the human and material means to deal with the pandemic, therefore they feel - he said - ""abandoned"" by the regional government. ""We need urgent help,"" he assured, then sentenced that ""no one"" was responding to this request for help.

>Likewise, Sampedro claimed that since the first positive for coronavirus -which according to his account arrived a couple of weeks ago- the home closed, and only workers could enter it, while the elderly remain in their rooms, forcing them to ""triple the shifts"" to be able to attend them one by one. ""We are even working with fever,"" he noted.

I can't translate them, obviously, but numbers should be universally understood. I highly recommend looking at them! 


Translation of original article (done with deepl.com):


The aim was to slow down the spread of the virus. But slow would still be too fast, say Germany's epidemiologists - the hospitals would be hopelessly overtaxed. Now containment is the name of the game. That means: tough measures that take a long time.



Scientists and physicians are exerting increasing pressure on politicians to extend the considerable initial restrictions in order to contain the spread of coronaviruses nationwide. According to the virological advisor to the German government, Christian Drosten, the German Society of Epidemiology has now also reacted to the exponentially increasing infection rates in a statement: ""Currently, there is a short time window in which the decision between containing or slowing down the spread of the infection can still be made without overburdening the healthcare system. Now it is a matter of ""restricting social contacts to the bare essentials in the entire population"".


Slowing down or containment - these are the only options as long as there are no proven effective drugs. The goal of slowing down was recently mostly clothed in the formula that one must ""flatten the curve"": no fewer people would be infected than without the recommended or prescribed protective measures, but the spread of the virus in the population would be spread over a long period of time. Containment, on the other hand, refers to the goal of stopping the spread of the virus so that no one is infected at all. If this were to succeed in Germany, which seems unrealistic in the absence of a vaccine even with drastic measures, it would also be necessary to prevent ""a renewed introduction of the infection"" into Germany, as the epidemiologists' paper states.



Success is ""practically unimaginable"" 

Slowing down is and remains the approach followed in most of the countries concerned. As long as the number of infected persons was manageable, this resulted in calls for hand hygiene, isolation of infected persons and quarantine for contact persons. ""Social distance"" became a battle cry: people should keep one and a half to two meters distance to their fellow human beings. The Chancellor also called on the Germans to do this. The Society for Epidemiology also believes that the figures of individual regional virus clusters show ""that the measures taken so far have already led to a reduction in the effective reproduction rate"".


The reproduction number of the virus (R0) indicates how many other people an infected person can infect. It thus corresponds, so to speak, to the rate of infection and is - in addition to the mortality rate - a decisive indicator of the spread of the pathogen. However, it is difficult to determine in an ongoing epidemic because the infectivity of the virus depends on many characteristics of the virus itself, such as the behaviour of the population and the proportion of citizens already infected or immune. R0 therefore changes in the course of an epidemic, and it also varies regionally depending on the density of infection. The new model calculations are largely based on Chinese figures on the spread of the Covid 19 virus; these are not very reliable, but better data are not yet available.


If protective measures had not yet been taken, the study estimates that the infection rate in Germany would be between two and three: each infected person would therefore infect two to three more people. Although the current strategy has reduced the infection rate, it has not been sufficient, the epidemiologists' opinion states. Only if the spread of the virus could be slowed down to an infection rate of just over one, would German hospitals be able to cope with the expected number of intensive care patients.


The model is based on the approximately 30,000 intensive care beds currently available, most of which are occupied independently of the corona pandemic, and an average length of stay for corona patients of twenty days. These assumptions are also provisional, however, because in some places an expansion of bed capacities is already being organised. Even with optimistic assumptions, the epidemiologists assume that with only a continuation of the measures taken so far, the capacities of the health care system would possibly be drastically exceeded and an infection rate of 1 to 1.2 would not be reached: ""Controlling the speed of spread into this narrow range seems practically inconceivable"".



Time is running out

According to the epidemiological model, the decisive factor here is the timing: the measures would have to be taken immediately. The model was based on two different assumptions from 15 March onwards: that the measures taken so far had already reduced the infection rate to 2 or even to 1.5. Even in the more optimistic scenario, there would not be much time left. ""These scenarios show that additional measures would have to be introduced within the next two weeks in order not to exceed the capacity of the intensive care units. It is also likely that these cuts would have to be maintained over the next few months in order to completely contain the spread of infection.

As far as the regulatory nature of the prescribed restrictions is concerned, however, the scientists are cautious: it is important to convince the population to contribute voluntarily and consistently to the restriction of transmission. However, because the restriction of civil rights and thus the freedom of movement of people would lead to ""considerable burdens for people and companies"", there is an urgent need for a public debate on the matter."

First off, thanks for answering questions, it's obviously vital to get the right information out there. There is a lot of misinformation and hardly any way for most people to see what's actually going on.

As for my question, you talk about a vaccine being ineffective in a manner similar to influenza, and I agree that this is a possibility. However, do you think this is likely given that it is a coronavirus? I would think not, and that extreme changes that render a vaccine ineffective like the seasonal flu would be unlikely if only because coronaviruses typically contain a 3' proofreading through their replicase enzymes that keep their mutation rates lower \[1\].

Empirically, they have found that SARS-Cov-2 mutates at about half the rate of seasonal flu \[2\], and the significantly larger genome means many of those changes are less meaningful to the overall function. That is, the virus sort of has to ""hunt around"" more to evolve something meaningfully advantageous. In terms of mutation and vaccine effectiveness, I would expect this to be far more like SARS than the seasonal flu.

Also, my impression was that a vaccine for the common cold is unfeasible not just because the viruses mutate, but because there are far too many. I mean it can be any number of rhinoviruses, adenoviruses, etc... and there are tons and tons of strains of each, all of which have mutated over a very long time to become very ""good"" viruses, that is, infectious but not deadly to the host.

Maybe it's wishful thinking, but the more I read the more I start to think we may be a bit better off than the most dire predictions with regards to mutation and eventual vaccine success. That doesn't change protocol moving forward, but I do think that a vaccine for this virus, if we can develop a successful on and if we can get it back under control, should be somewhat longer lasting and more effective than our seasonal flu efforts.

China suppressed information about the virus in the early weeks of December when the virus first broke out. It was not hidden for months, it was hidden for weeks. By the end of the year, Chinese citizens knew about the existence of the virus, although not in great detail. While Trump was bumbling about it being a Democrat hoax at the end of February, China had already been on lockdown for an entire month.

The United States was not blindsided by the coronavirus. The virus simply exposed the terrible leadership at the federal level—leadership that did nothing to contain the initial spread of the virus despite ample evidence that it was going to devastate the U.S. Other countries, like South Korea, reported initial cases around the same time the United States did; yet, they are far better equipped today to deal with the virus than we are. Why is that?

China fumbled their initial response to the virus, but when the government realized how out of control it was, it took swift and decisive action to contain it. Meanwhile, at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, Trump got caught with his pants down and is blaming everyone else for looking."

During challenging times, we focus on what really matters: family, loved ones and community. Those reminders also serve as our inspiration and a call to action. 

Since our return to Los Angeles, our organizational priority has been to use the Rams to bring together Angelenos and inspire our city to shine its brightest. We’ve seen the amazing spirit of Rams fans throughout the Coliseum and its parking lots, in your homes and restaurants, and outside SoFi Stadium en route to the Super Bowl.

While most of our gatherings have been in times of joy, others have been in times of healing and emotion. Our Monday Night Football game against the Chiefs showed that Rams football, powered by each of you, could bring a city and region together when it was needed most to heal from the Borderline shooting and to honor our first responders who kept us safe from wildfires.

From ownership down, our first thought in this time of need has been how we could bring together our fans and our region to help our fellow Angelenos who are hurting the most from the economic and health fallout of the COVID-19 pandemic. While Rams fans are at our best in large groups, not social distancing six feet apart, the high-fives, hugs and joy that accompany the Rams need to be saved for Inglewood and SoFi Stadium this fall. Right now, we are focused on channeling our Rams energy into an effort to help our fellow fans and community at large while keeping everyone safer at home.

Thanks to our newest partner ABC-7, and our long-time partners at the United Way of Greater Los Angeles and Los Angeles Regional Food Bank, we are coming together virtually to help those in need.

On Tuesday, March 24, we are partnering with KABC on a virtual Te”LA”thon for Los Angeles to raise money for the United Way of Greater Los Angeles’ Pandemic Relief Fund in direct support of community partners, including Los Angeles Regional Food Bank.  The UWGLA’s Pandemic Relief Fund will provide immediate relief to low-income individuals, students and families at imminent risk of homelessness as well as the unsheltered residents across LA County who are experiencing disproportionate hardship due to the impact of coronavirus (COVID-19).  Yesterday, our captains Jared Goff and Andrew Whitworth each pledged $250,000 to Los Angeles Food Bank which will fund a total of 2 million meals for Angelenos in need and serve as the lead gifts for the Te”LA”thon.

A number of our players, coaches, staff and other members of the Rams community will participate on Tuesday, asking those who are able to donate money.  You can find more information about the Te”LA”thon here.

We know Rams fans will bring their love for our city to the virtual Te”LA”thon, but we also want to make sure we directly reach those who can’t participate.  To that end, we are partnering with Los Angeles Regional Food Bank to sponsor mobile food pantries in 20 different neighborhoods throughout Los Angeles for the remainder of the year.  The mobile food pantries feature a refrigerated truck that contains healthy foods such as produce, frozen turkeys and fish. When the truck rolls in, families can shop farmers’ market-style and fill grocery bags with items to feed their families for up to two weeks.  Each mobile food pantry serves at least 200 families, so over the course of the year, we will provide hundreds of thousands of meals. These meals will be delivered in Rams-branded grocery bags in the names of our Season Ticket Members. Each bag will have a hang tag that includes the name of one of our Season Ticket Members. We will be donating these groceries on your behalf, helping fuel up Angelenos in need, just as you fuel us each day to be our best.

What logo will be on those grocery bags? Well, we had planned to reveal our new colors and logos this coming weekend with a big surprise planned for Los Angeles, but in these unprecedented times, like Sean McVay does best, we had to call an audible and get into a different formation.

On Monday, March 23 at noon PST, we will host a live stream on therams.com and our social channels during which we will reveal our new logos and colors to our fans.  We have loved seeing all of the creative ideas and feedback on social media throughout this process and are excited for you to continue this journey with us.  Giving back to our community and inspiring Angelenos is at the heart of our organization, so it is fitting that we will showcase our new look as part of the Te”LA”thon. Furthermore, anyone who donates to the Te”LA”thon has a chance to win a Rams hat donning our new brand, while supplies last. And don’t worry – it's not the hat that you saw on social media a few weeks ago.

Later this spring, after years of planning, designing and receiving considerable input from our fans, we will roll out our new uniforms. We look forward to sharing them with you in the coming months.

Before concluding, we have a large and diverse fan base that is helping keep Los Angeles safe in many ways, but I want to offer a special thank you on behalf of our team to the healthcare workers who are putting the most vulnerable Angelenos first, the true embodiment of “We not Me”.

Through your passion, the Los Angeles Rams strive to be a beacon of unity and hope during Sundays in the fall and every day throughout the year. We look forward to tapping into the power of each of you to help our fellow Angelenos when they need it most and look forward to the days when celebratory hugs and high-fives are allowed again.

Respectfully,


Kevin Demoff
Los Angeles Rams

1. We're accelerating the adoption of technologies which allow us to work and collaborate remotely, and securely.  
2. Senior leaders (even in the government) are accepting more cyber risk to keep the workforce working.  
3. More productivity as employees have no commute time and will most likely start their day earlier.  
4. This situation highlights the importance of disaster recovery, and business continuity plans.  
5. Proving the meme correct - we really are seeing which meetings could have been just emails  
6. Staying at home reduces our carbon footprint by driving less, using less electricity at our workplaces, making traffic better!  
7. Employees are being trusted more to telecommute and first level supervisors are finding methods to keep them accountable.  
8. Society is more conscious about germs and improving their hygiene. If nothing else, washing their hands more.  
9. We may be eating healthier by not eating as much fast food and large meals at lunch.  


Most important:  


10. We are spending more time with our families!"

I understand that this virus is dangerous to certain individuals and is spreading at an alarming rate. Furthermore, it is an illness that nobody wants to deal with. However, it is inevitable that the world must face this virus just like many other viruses we deal with every year. No one wants to get sick, but why must the responsibility of combating this virus be upon the government rather than the individual? A person takes a risk everyday leaving their house. Whether they are going to go drive their car or possibly get murdered. But we take risks like these everyday. So why must we treat this virus any different? 

People have jobs, people have families to take care of. Some people are willing to take risks to fulfill these responsibilities. If people are so worried about getting sick, then THEY should isolate themselves, not the whole population. All of this quarantining will most likely bear no effect on the rate of the virus infecting people since every country and state is infected. 

The point is that pandemics should have no effect on the decentralization of government and the promotion of liberty. Let people take their risks and let people isolate themselves. It does no good to anybody if the government prevents EVERYBODY from carrying out their jobs and responsibilities."

2020-03-20,Hektor_Ekhein,Coronavirus,9,https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/florkq/s_korea_mask_and_filter_industries_object_to/fkzs78z/,"Translation of article:

With the new coronavirus infection (Covid-19) showing signs of being a long-term issue, the government is asking mask producers to convert up to 70% of production to 'KF80' standard instead of the 'KF94 (*roughly equivalent to N95*)' that was previously produced, but industry response is unenthusiastic.

The government's rationale for switching to KF80, which requires less raw materials, is to benefit from an 'increase' in the number of masks and also switch the mask rations to KF80, but the production rate is equal for both KF94 and KF80 masks.

Furthermore, it's difficult for filter manufacturers to switch immediately production to KF80, and as the government had been strictly imposing that KF80 has 'no infectious agent protection', companies are confused by the government's capriciousness.

&#x200B;

During a briefing on the 14th, the Ministry of Food and Drug Safety (FDS) reported that ""in order to convert production from KF94 to KF80, work is being started on facility conversion, purchase of raw materials, etc. We anticipate visible results starting the following week"".

For confirmation, FDS sent a letter to manufacturers last week entitled <(Emergency) Health Mask KF80 Production Conversion Cooperation and Plan Submission Request>, stating ""each manufacturer must consult with their MB filter manufacturers and order KF80 filters. We need to prepare thoroughly for converting to KF80 production, so reorder packaging as well. ""

The core material of the KF-certified health mask is the MB (melt-blown) filter. Manufacturing a filter for KF80 uses 20\~30% less core material than for KF94. FDS judged that using less of this core material could increase mask production by up to 50%.

Mask makers who heard the news pointed out that the government has until now, always emphasized that KF80 cannot provide ""infectious agent protection"", and changing the rationed masks to KF80 right now is going against their previous claims.

&#x200B;

FDS has so far approved the KF80 grade under the reason of 'protecting the respiratory system from harmful substances such as yellow dust and fine dust.' The official position of the FDS was that it had no protection against infectious agents such as viruses. On the other hand, KF94 grade was approved as 'protecting the respiratory system from harmful substances such as yellow dust, fine dust, or infectious agents', and masks could be called ""prevention masks"" from KF94 grade and above.

For this reason, FDS had been punishing manufacturers for 'over-advertising' if they included the phrase 'protection from infectious agents' while selling KF80 masks.

&#x200B;

A mask industry worker **A** said, ""It's self-conflicting for the FDS to strictly monitor the mask's quarantine ability standards and suddenly lower it now. With study results showing that the Covid-19 virus survives for more than 3 hours in the form of an aerosol, it's inconceivable why they want to reduce KF94 production and convert to KF80. It's like they're obsessed with mask supply statistics.""

Another mask industry worker **B** said, ""If the government wants to change the KF80 for the purpose of preventing only droplet spread, it would be better to print health masks padded with waterproof non-woven fabric. Then they can be sold on the market for 200\~300 KRW (around 18\~20 cents)"".

&#x200B;

There have been remarks that the government was ignorant of the mask production industry's situation in the process of requesting this ""KF94 → KF80 conversion"".

A mask industry worker **C** said that ""Production speeds of KF80 and KF94 masks are equal. Maybe the filter production speed will slightly increase, but mask production will have the same output"".

He pointed out ""Telling producers who are hard at work making KF94 masks to stop operations and convert to KF80 is nonsense. Market demand is utterly tilted towards KF94, and converting to KF80 will be giving up competitiveness in the market"".

**C** also complained that ""There's hundreds of millions of KF94 packaging I've ordered, but the government is just ordering us to 'do what you can'. Every day, the people from the Ministry of Food, Drug, Police and Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy are monitoring us like criminals"".

Similarly, **B** said ""Report to the Ministry of Commerce, Industry and Energy, report to the Ministry of Food and Drug Safety - there are too many reports to make. We must manage our production in the remaining time. I would think that if we report to the FDS, the report should be shared between ministries, but instead they tell us to report to each individual ministry, while following each ministry's specific report format"".

Grumbles are rising in the filter industry as well. A source in the filter industry said, “Filters don't fall under FDS jurisdiction, and it was unpleasant to listen to them order us to change to KF80 as if we had to follow their orders. All manufacturers are focusing on producing KF94 masks, but it's difficult to comply with orders to print KF80 filters that we don't even know are going to be used"".

&#x200B;

In response to a fact-check call from our newspaper, an official from the FDS said, ""We meant that overall production could increase for the mid- to long-term, not that the daily production would increase. Creating a 50% gain is not a short-term goal. There must have been a misunderstanding in communication"".

Regarding the government's own reduction of the mask protection standards set by law, the FDS official said, ""Even experts judge that the KF80 standard is sufficient for prevention. The KF80 also has some (prevention) effects, it's just that we don't test for it"".

He then added ""As we obviously cannot leave \[KF80 effects and functions\] standards as is, we are discussing ways to reflect the current situation"", implying a possible reduction in standards.

\-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

TL;DR

1. Gov tried to reduce mask production standards to drive up production numbers
2. Masks take the same time to manufacture, regardless of prevention grade
3. Gov is now saying ""error in communication"", says that they weren't trying to drive up daily production, only total production over a long-term period."

To be clear, the report was for the UK, but if you take these models and plug them into the USA, it does a pretty good job outlining this.[ Credit Twitter Jeremy Young for a really nice breakdown](https://twitter.com/jeremycyoung/status/1239975682643357696) (and if you want to have some nightmares)

""You may or may not have seen the Imperial College of London report. This will and should scare everyone. Let’s walk through what they did: The Imperial College team plugged infection and death rates from China/Korea/Italy into epidemic modelling software and ran a simulation: what happens if the US does absolutely nothing -- if we treat COVID-19 like the flu, go about our business, and let the virus take its course?""

**Now specifically addressing a vaccine and trying to paint our own picture:**

We’ve heard a lot of people say we just need to hold out until a vaccine. Then life will go back to what it was like before, and we have pretty significant concern that it is being treated as a magic bullet to reverse time to what it was like before. But let's paint an alternative picture here where the vaccine is more like the Flu vaccine. The vaccine sort of-maybe works, but we’ll still have an outbreak of the flu every year, and every year thousands of people will die (as they have for many years with the seasonal flu). 

Why do we think that? Well, this novel coronavirus is somewhat related and in the same family as the viruses that cause the common cold (which is usually caused by one of a number of relatively benign coronaviruses). And you can’t really make a vaccine for the common cold. Why? Because by the time we come out with a vaccine to the virus, there may be multiple strains across the world with different genetic variations (imagine COVID with 18 months to evolve). I’m not convinced a new strain won’t just travel to an area immunized for a different strain and resprout again, and that's assuming a vaccine is 100% effective for a particular strain (which it likely won't be).  Now, there are vaccines being developed that target parts of the flu virus that are similar across strains, and that may work with coronaviruses as well, but we’re many years from that point.  

So here’s what I think the future will look like. We’ll get this novel coronavirus under control, if, and only if, we do things like self-quarantine aggressively. We’ll develop a vaccine, and the symptoms will be milder, but it won’t entirely prevent it (much like the flu shot, which decreases the symptoms and duration of - but doesn’t entirely prevent - influenza). But every so often, maybe once or twice a year, there will be flare-ups, and we likely haven’t seen the last of things like occasional city-wide lockdowns and travel restrictions. This might be a new reality for us for a long time. This is assuming we actually do quarantine and self-isolate. If not, well, [read up on the numbers people are projecting](https://twitter.com/jeremycyoung/status/1239975682643357696). I want to try to avoid being too pessimistic here today. It's not fun for a Friday afternoon.


**TL;DR We have choices. Either we self-quarantine and lockdown for a short period (months), or lots of bad things will happen.**

Sir, – Many people have been showing great support to the healthcare workers that are on the “frontline’’. I have had people asking me what they can do to support doctors and nurses in the fight against coronavirus. This is a heartwarming sentiment but it also shows a huge misunderstanding of what is actually going on here. The frontline is not in hospitals. The frontline is where you are, out on the streets. If we are using this war analogy, doctors and nurses are not the soldiers. They are still just the doctors and nurses, dealing with the casualties of war. It is the everyday citizen who is the soldier. It is you who is playing the most important role in fighting this disease. We do not have medicine to treat this virus. Prevention is the only way to fight this. Prevention is up to every one of us.
There are two things about viruses that we all must understand. First, they require hosts to spread. They cannot replicate by themselves. Every time you come into contact with someone you are giving the virus a chance to spread, to replicate, and become more powerful. Every time you decide to avoid contact with someone new, you starve the virus.
Second, viruses spread exponentially. Every time you come into contact with someone new, you are not just putting that person at risk, but also all the people that that person comes into contact with, and all the people that those people come into contact with. Every time you meet one person, it will affect an untold number of people, many of whom will have weaker immune systems than you, and will suffer severely. It is your duty to protect these vulnerable people. I cannot stress this enough. It is the decisions that you make that will decide the course of this disaster.
Social distancing is the most important intervention we can all carry out. It is our greatest weapon. If you can self-isolate for at least two weeks you will help flatten the curve and you will save countless lives. That is the gift that healthcare workers are praying for. Please be our heroes! – Yours, etc,
Dr COLM HARRINGTON,
Salthill, Galway."

One of the main reasons I got fired for was because I pushed back about my (now former) company's COVID19 policy. The policy was relayed to us after the virus was considered a pandemic. As much as this sounds like satire, I can assure you it is not. 

A few weeks ago, my manager came in and said ""We think the Coronavirus is overblown. We are treating this like any other illness. If you test positive, you can come in and work or you can take stay home, but if you stay home you have to take sick leave. We are not mandating anyone to stay home."" I interjected, saying that I have young children and a pregnant wife, who is in her 3rd trimester, and I did not agree with the policy. This was met with the comment ""Can you tell me the death rate of babies and pregnant women related to this virus?""

Subsequent to this, we received an email from our CEO, stating that working from home was available in extenuating circumstances, as approved by VPs (we all have laptops and VPN but we weren't allowed to work from home at the time). My wife, being \~1 month from delivery, is scheduled to deliver at a hospital which does not allow any visitors, and only 1 ""support person"", who is screened at the hospital door to determine if they've been exposed to or are showing symptoms of COVID19. I requested to WFH due to these hospital restrictions and the potential exposure at work, along with the risk that I'd miss my child's birth and wouldn't be able to support my wife during her first childbirth. The next day, I was called into a meeting, where my manager said ""I was surprised to receive your email. Was I not clear enough before about our work from home policy? We are coming to work, and if you cannot get behind Management's decision, perhaps you should reconsider your employment at (company).""

Medical associations and unions pushed back Friday against new federal guidelines for conserving and reusing masks, saying they will leave them unprotected against a dangerous infection carried by waves of patients already at their doors.

“Needless to say this is frightening for our staff,” Katie Oppenheim, chair of the union for University of Michigan nurses, said on a conference call with reporters.

Randi Weingarten, president of the American Federation of Teachers, which represents 112,000 health professionals, described the delays in procuring additional equipment — when officials knew from the experience of other countries this would be a problem — as unethical.

“If I sound angry,” she said, “I am.”

President Trump has announced steps in recent days to address the nation’s dwindling supplies of protective equipment for health-care workers — authorizing the release of emergency stockpiles, and working with manufacturers to ramp up production in a wartime-like effort. But health-care workers on the front lines are voicing frustration — and panic — that such help may arrive too late. If they can’t stay healthy, they say, the whole system will fall apart.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention earlier this week loosened its minimum requirements for how personal protective equipment should be used in times of shortages, suggesting that certain items be used only in risky procedures, or for more extended periods of time. As a last resort, the CDC suggested, bandannas could be used in place of masks.

Sign up for our Coronavirus Updates newsletter to track the outbreak. All stories linked in the newsletter are free to access.

Health-care workers say those guidelines are insufficient to protect them against a virus as deadly as covid-19. In addition, they say more test kits need to be made available to them to catch infections among doctors and nurses earlier.

One doctor in New York City, an internist in her 30s who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said her facility was now following those guidelines and that surgical masks, rather than the more protective N95 masks, were being used in most cases. She said she was reprimanded for wearing a leftover N95 mask because it might make others feel their surgical masks were inadequate. She added that now even those surgical masks may be running low.

""There is huge concern that we’ll run out of everything soon,” she said, noting that the number of confirmed covid-19 cases in New York had doubled overnight.

Some health-care systems have gone even further to conserve supplies.

At Beth Israel Lahey Health in the Boston area, workers were told this week of “extreme shortages” and asked to wear only single-use protective equipment “for as long as they can tolerate during their shift.” They were also asked not to discard any surgical masks, N95 respirators or eye protection but to place the used ones in special bins to be saved.

“BILH is investigating potential options for mask sterilization and future repurposing,” according to a copy of the memo obtained by The Post. “This is not currently active but we are storing supply in the interim.”

Amid the shortages, doctors across the country are scrambling to secure their own masks. The New York City doctor said a physician friend in Seattle had mailed her half a dozen N95 masks. When another doctor with a relative in Taiwan said she had a line on some N95 masks, other physicians eagerly asked for 50 or 100.

“She said, 'I got a guy selling them for $3 a piece, who’s in?’ ” the New York City doctor said with a laugh. “It sounds like a drug deal.”

Standards set by medical associations say that health-care staff conducting testing for covid-19 should have gloves, gown, goggles, disposable face shields, and N95 masks — which are fitted and can filter extraordinarily small particles like viruses. But at many testing sites, they are given only looser-fitting surgical masks.

For workers helping with high-risk procedures such as intubations of infected patients, which sends sprays of droplets into the air, power air-purifying respirators or PAPRs are recommended. But as the number of patients increases, many hospitals have put in to place protocols that allow for the use of N95 masks in these situations.

The American Medical Association said in a statement Friday that this situation of workers wearing a single mask for a full day and cleaning them or sewing their own protective gear is not sustainable, and called on the Trump administration to “pull every lever” to secure supplies.

Eat enough food that's good for you, go for a walk or get some exercise if you're not sick, make sure you get a good amount of sleep, and try to focus on managing your stress levels so your immune system is up and running at 100% and kicking ass!

It was *crystal* clear by mid-February that shit was about to go down. Anyone who really looked into this with publicly available information could have made those calls. Maybe not 100% sure when there'd be a crash, but that the risks were heavy and pulling out of the markets until it cooled off was a wise move.

I sold all my stock near the end of January. My inside information? Subreddits. Thank you Reddit, I literally made tens of thousands of dollars inside trading off of you. Keep your filthy gold, I'll take cash and bonds though. I didn't need a senate report.

The number was jarring given official reports that only a few thousand people were infected, and people immediately began to respond with concern. The People’s Daily account quickly deleted the post and associated hashtag. 

Linda took a screenshot and saved it. (She asked that we use a pseudonym because she fears retaliation from the Chinese authorities. We verified her identity by asking her to send information from the accounts she uses to post her work.) Today Linda lives in northern China, but she’s a native of Wuhan, the capital of Hubei and the epicenter of the outbreak. She’d been in the city for the Lunar New Year holiday, but left to return home on January 22. Earlier in January she’d started collecting information about the virus to share with her family; back then they were “very relaxed” about the situation.

But after concern grew worldwide, she decided to spend time collecting, translating, and archiving information as a form of public service. The Chinese government is famously willing to censor its citizens; already, it has deleted many posts criticizing the government for its handling of the outbreak, as well as stories of people affected by the virus. “I feared that [these accounts] would disappear,” Linda says, “and that people’s experiences won’t be reported. I just want to keep an emotional archive of some sort for people asking for help and affected by it, mostly patients and medical workers.” Not everything in the archive will be accurate, and she is aware of that risk, but not everything posted from government channels has been accurate either."

L.A. County gives up on containing coronavirus, tells doctors to skip testing of some patients
The nation’s second-largest municipal health system has told its staff that it is essentially abandoning hope of containing the coronavirus outbreak and instructed doctors not to bother testing symptomatic patients if a positive result won’t change how they would be treated.

The guidance, sent by the Los Angeles County Department of Health Services to its doctors on Thursday, was prompted by a crush of patients and shortage of tests, and could make it difficult to ever know precisely how many people in L.A. County contracted the virus.

The department “is shifting from a strategy of case containment to slowing disease transmission and averting excess morbidity and mortality,” according to the letter. Doctors should test symptomatic patients only when “a diagnostic result will change clinical management or inform public health response.”

The guidance sets in writing what has been a reality all along. The shortage of tests nationwide has meant that many patients suspected of having COVID-19 have not had the diagnosis confirmed by a laboratory.

Advertisement

In addition to the lack of tests, public health agencies across the country lack the staff to trace the source of new cases, drastically reducing the chances of isolating people who have been exposed and thereby containing the outbreak.

For years, state and local health officials have been warning that steep cuts to federal grants meant to boost preparedness for a pandemic would mean there wouldn’t be enough equipment and staff on hand to respond in the crucial, early stage. Those fears have come to fruition now, officials said.

A front-line healthcare provider who was not authorized to speak to the media and requested anonymity said county doctors are interpreting Thursday’s letter and other advice coming from senior L.A. County public health officials to mean they should only test patients who are going to be hospitalized or have something unique about the way they contracted the virus.

They are not planning to test patients who have the symptoms but are otherwise healthy enough to be sent home to self-quarantine — meaning they may never show up in official tallies of people who tested positive.

Advertisement

The letter also says that, with the increasing availability of tests at private labs, the health department will focus on testing aimed at detecting and preventing outbreaks in hospitals and “congregate living settings,” such as nursing homes.

Department officials did not immediately respond to a request for comment."

If you can’t guarantee all your students have online access, nothing’s graded,” said Tim Robinson, a spokesman in Seattle Public Schools in Washington, which closed schools and plans to broadcast not-for-grade educational activities online and by TV.  The U.S. Department of Education recently sent out information to remind educators that schools moving to online learning must comply with civil rights laws, including making sure such tools are available to students with disabilities. Some teacher unions have decried school districts rolling out online plans not accessible to all.

He is now recently retired but was a doctor at Massachusetts General Hospital. He asked me to spread the information:

From Boston Doctors Corona Virus
 

Letter from MDs in our Boston community: please share “As there is so much confusion, misinformation and denial on social media about the coronavirus we hope to explain, in plain language, why the experts see this as such an emergency. Many people are reading the claim online that this virus is a lot like the viruses that cause colds, and that if you get it, it will probably just seem like a bad cold and you are very unlikely to die. Depending on who you are, this may be true, but there is more to this story that is key to our outcome as a community. This is a coronavirus that is new to the human population. Although it is related to the viruses that cause colds, and acts a lot like them in many ways, nobody has ever been exposed to this before, which means nobody has any immunity to it. The virus is now moving explosively through the human population, spreading through respiratory secretions and 10 times more contagious that the flu or cold. Although many people will recover, about 20% will wind up with a serious pneumonia that will require hospitalization. Some will be so ill from the pneumonia that they will die. We estimate this may be 2-3%, but it is higher in Italy’s experience, partially because the healthcare system was overwhelmed so rapidly. In those over age 70, the death rate is 8-20%. So if a child catches it on a playdate, they can easily transmit it to their grandmother as easily as touching the same doorknob or countertop. Scientists measure the spread of an epidemic by a number called R0, or “R naught.” That number is calculated this way: for every person who develops the illness, how many other people do they give it to before they are cured (or dead) and no longer infectious? The R0 for coronavirus appears to be a number close to 3 – an extremely frightening number for such a deadly disease. Suppose you catch the virus. You will give it to 3 other people, and they will each give it to three others, and so forth. Here is how the math works, where you, the “index case,” are the first line:

1

3

9

27

81

243

729

2,187

6,561

19,683

59,046

177,147

531,441

1,594,323

4,782,969

14,348,907

So, in just 15 steps of transmission, the virus has gone from just one index case to 14.3 million other people. Those 15 steps might take only a few weeks. With school out and lots of playdates, maybe less. The first person may be young and healthy Brookline child, but many of those 14 million people will be old and sick, and they will likely die because they got a virus that started in one person's throat. R0 is not fixed – it can be lowered by control measures. If we can get the number below 1, the epidemic will die out. This is the point of the quarantines and social distancing, but we are not doing it fast enough. In the US, we have to slow down the virus. American hospitals, Boston hospitals, have limited resources. We have a fixed number of ventilators and an impending calamity on our hands. Our Italian critical care colleagues have shared with us that they simply do not have enough resources (ventilators, physicians and nurse, critical care beds), and are forced to choose who lives and dies based on old tenets of wartime triage. Older patients do not even get a ventilator and die of their pneumonia. These are decisions nobody should have to face, and we are only 11 days behind Italy’s fate. Their hospitals are quite advanced, and we are no better in Boston. As doctors, we are desperately trying to prepare for the onslaught of patients in the coming weeks. It is already beginning. This is an opportunity for you as the district leadership the time to be aggressive and help us fight this by “Flattening the Curve”. We implore you, as a group of Boston’s doctors preparing to fight this, to help us. Please send a new email to ALL the Brookline school district families. Social distancing is painful. We know that kids have cabin fever, they are pleading to see their friends, they may have birthday parties coming up or special events they have been looking forward to. All of us need to work and childcare is a big worry. But we need to overcome these issues and boredom for the coming weeks so that we can survive this with as few deaths as possible. What does that mean? 1) No playdates, not even 1:1. 2) No small gatherings, no meetings between a couple families, even for birthday parties. 3) Avoid trampoline parks, climbing gyms, restaurants, movie theaters, anything in an enclosed area. Many of these places are advertising increased cleaning and hygiene. This is not sufficient! Do not go. 4) Cancel planned vacations for the next month. Avoid airline travel that is not an emergency. Many airlines and rental agencies are offering penalty free cancellations. 5) Stay at home as much as possible. Work from home if you possibly can. You may have to go buy groceries and medicine, of course, but make the trips quick and purposeful. 6) Wash your hands thoroughly after you have been in public places, for a full 20 seconds, soaping up thoroughly and being sure to get between the fingers. 7) Please avoid disseminating social media claims that the situation is not serious or is being exaggerated. This is a national crisis and conveying misinformation to your friends and family may put their lives in danger. 

 

Thank you for taking the time to read this and stay safe and healthy in the coming weeks.”

I’m not a doctor but can only tell you how it feels to me. At first I thought I was getting bronchitis but when I tried to cough anything up there’s nothing there. I feel like I’m wheezing on the tail end of both inhaling and exhaling. I was checked with a stethoscope by a doctor nine days ago and she said my lungs were clear. 

It’s like having asthma or bronchitis. There’s an obstruction but I don’t have shortness of breath. 

I don’t have a fever. Sometimes in the evening I’ll get warm but no high fever. My other symptoms are occasional body aches and headaches. Also glassy eyes. All the time. I had diarrhea on and off two weeks in and bad nausea one night. That night was the worst for me. Tonight I feel like I’ve turned a corner. My lungs feel like they’ve cleared up a bit. 

Health officials determined that I should not be tested as of yet. I’m considered to have a mild case and am low risk for dying.  Treatment doesn’t change if I get tested for where I’m at with this virus. 

When I was checked out by a doctor nine days ago, before I even considered it to be this virus, my blood pressure was slightly higher than normal (but still good -my normal bp is low) and my oximeter reading was 95%. I get my vitals checked regularly and that reading is normally at 98-99%. I have no idea if that means anything. The doctor at the time said I had no fever and so no coronavirus. 

I was in contact with someone at the beginning of March who has this virus. I didn’t find this out until four days ago."

February 28: “We're ordering a lot of supplies. We're ordering a lot of, uh, elements that frankly we wouldn't be ordering unless it was something like this. But we're ordering a lot of different elements of medical.”

February 28: “Now the Democrats are politicizing the coronavirus, you know that, right? Coronavirus, they’re politicizing it. We did one of the great jobs.

March 5: “The United States… has, as of now, only 129 cases… and 11 deaths. We are working very hard to keep these numbers as low as possible!”

March 6: “I think we’re doing a really good job in this country at keeping it down… a tremendous job at keeping it down.”

March 6: “Anybody right now, and yesterday, anybody that needs a test gets a test. They’re there. And the tests are beautiful…. the tests are all perfect like the letter was perfect. The transcription was perfect. Right? This was not as perfect as that but pretty good.”

March 6: “I like this stuff. I really get it. People are surprised that I understand it… Every one of these doctors said, ‘How do you know so much about this?’ Maybe I have a natural ability. Maybe I should have done that instead of running for president.”

Some states could enforce a [quarantine](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5886825/) using police [(think Typhoid Mary)](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00219266.1998.9655608). 

There are [public health orders](https://www.cdc.gov/quarantine/aboutlawsregulationsquarantineisolation.html) for federal, state, and local.

A “lockdown“ isn’t a defined term but could mean could be used to refer to anything from *mandatory geographic quarantine* (which would probably be unconstitutional under most scenarios in the US), to *non-mandatory recommendations* to *shelter in place* (which are totally legal and can be issued by health officials at the federal, state, or local level), to anything in between (e.g. ordering certain events or types of businesses to close, which is generally constitutional if deemed necessary to stop the spread of disease based on available evidence).

[Other countries](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/18/what-a-coronavirus-lockdown-might-mean-for-london) are structured differently and restrict citizens differently. In the case of Wuhan it meant not leaving home except for essentials (food, toiletries), doctor appointments, and emergencies. In Italy travel is only allowed for “urgent, verifiable work situations and emergencies or health reasons.” [Yesterday](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-03-19/italy-is-now-world-s-deadliest-hotspot-in-the-virus-pandemic) they further clamped down on outdoor activities, closed parks, and stopped

2020-03-20,concubovine,australia,7,https://www.reddit.com/r/australia/comments/flsuc4/coronavirus19_megathread_5_discussion_ideas/fl2jk67/,"I've posted this elsewhere yesterday, but thought it might be useful for people who should get tested and are concerned about the process, queues etc. Note that I returned from the Philippines last Saturday so it was easy for me to get a referral & tested at a fever clinic (in this case a designated Sullivan Nicolaides clinic). The test was done yesterday (Friday 19th) in Brisbane, QLD. 

I have very mild but definite symptoms. I was reluctant to ""waste"" a kit, but symptoms set in 4-5 days after my flight home so it's possible I was exposed on my flight home, or by someone at the Philippines office. Frankly after a week of self-isolation it would be nice just to be sure I have it so my partner knows she'll soon have it too, and we can both get out of the house and move forward with our lives once we're both confirmed recovered.

Called my local GP and got a phone consultation this morning. They went over my travel, timelines, symptoms etc and they gave me a referral to get tested (which was sent straight to the pathology lab). $55 fee for the consult.

Tried calling ahead to confirm they weren't too busy but no one ever picked up the phone. After half a dozen tries over a couple hours, I decided to just go and see if I could get it done before Friday night rush hour traffic started. Note only SPECIFIC clinics have been designated fever clinics. I went to the wrong lab the first time as there were several pathology labs with the same name within a couple of km of each other. Make sure you take note of the address and go to the right one.

After reading stories on reddit and elsewhere I wasn't sure what to expect. Walked in and the place was empty, no other patients waiting in line. Turns out that lab is only staffed by a single person and they won't answer the phone if they're with a patient. Moments after I walked in, the previous patient walked out and I got straight into the testing room.

The nurse went over all my symptoms and recorded the answers again, presumably to be submitted with the test. First test was a nasal swab where she stuck an extra long q-tip into the back of my nostrils, one for each nostril. Felt a bit like getting dumped in wave and having water go into my nose; mildly unpleasant. Second was two separate throat swabs which didn't hurt at all, one for coronavirus and one to test for other viruses.

That was it. Exited the testing room and there was no one else waiting.

I was told to expect results within 24-48 hours. Not sure if I'll get a call from my doctor, a text or some third party. If it's the doctor, I may not know until Monday. 

Note - the coronavirus test should be free for everyone, including international visitors. I think my doctor added on an extra viral pathology to test for other infections (the second throat swab) which would have cost me money if I didn't have a valid medicare card. I haven't received a test result yet today but hopefully soon."

When I tried to share it with my friend last night, she said she couldn't find mention of eight weeks anywhere. I just looked again and I can't find it either.

My interpretation of this is that they can no longer say with certainty things will be improved by 8 weeks, so it's a general call to cancel large events for however long it takes...

edit: I swear I've reread the page 5 times at this point haha, it feels like many details have changed since we saw this announcement a few days ago. It looks like they have also adjusted it back to being 250+ (as opposed to 50+), but with heavy consideration for vulnerable attendees, density, etc. as well as Trump's call to no 10+ events for at least 2 weeks. Someone else feel free to confirm though, because I'm basically playing spot-the-differences with my memory."

The only people that don't think we're going into lockdown is these Muppets. Just pull the trigger already so we don't have to spend as long locked down! 

The big issue is that we can't sustain a serious lockdown. 

* We have the second-highest personal debt in the world
* Our interest rates have already been cut down to the bone
* 50% of our population is living paycheck to paycheck
* The cost of living has skyrocketed in recent decades and wages haven't kept up
* We have huge issues with underemployment and a lot more people are at risk financially than the 5.3% unemployment figure suggests
* Our economy was being propped up by foreign money in a big way (which is fucked with the world shut down)
* We've just come out of a resource boom with no real money saved up 
* We don't have great assets to fall back on:
 * We've already sold a lot of govt assets at a loss to help pork-barrel elections
 * In spite all of our personal debt, we're a nation of renters
* Recent stimulus attempts have failed (see the tax break last year)
* Public trust in the government is incredibly low which will make coordinating an economic bounceback hard
* Large businesses have zero contingency plans in place, despite their recent record profits. They've all just worked on the assumption they will get bailed out if something bad happens
 * **e:** Just to put this in perspective:

The reality is, we can't lockdown. We can't afford it. 

Covid-19 is dangerous, but we also need money to survive. In that respect, all we have left right now is:

1. Taxing the rich - Not going to happen
2. Printing money - If we're relying on printing money for the next year our country will collapse
3. Keeping this country operating as long as possible

That's why you see the government and medical professionals talking about quarantining in stages. 

The way it's looking:

* We're quarantining in stages rather than all at once. You can already see that with the ban on large crowds
* We're going to hold off on hard quarantines for as long as we can
* After enacting hard quarantines we're going to have periods where we try to ease off those quarantines

The quarantine measures aren't great, but you have to understand we're trying to juggle two crises simultaneously."

Sources also told ESPN that the players are aware about the discussions and would need to give the green light for the club to temporarily cut their salaries.

During a conference call on Friday in which members of the club's board met remotely, Barca president Josep Maria Bartomeu explained his fellow members that the financial situation is ""complicated"" but it is still ""reversible"" if certain measures are taken.

Barcelona are not considering any temporary layoffs yet but sources have told ESPN that, due to the absence of income, players might need to cut their wages while games remain suspended due to the coronavirus pandemic.

According to the Global Sports Salary Survey, Barcelona is first team in history to have an average individual salary in excess of €11 million a year.

Furthermore, other sources told ESPN that players from Barcelona and from other clubs are in regular contact with the union representing Spain's players (AFE) in order to try to resolve a number of doubts over the matter.

Sources from Barcelona told ESPN that Bartomeu is leading the negotiations with members of the ECA (Association of European Clubs) and UEFA, as there is a general concern regarding the financial implications of the coronavirus in the club business.

Meanwhile, Barcelona CEO Oscar Grau is in talks with La Liga and other clubs around Europe so that they take concerted measures to address the impact of the coronavirus.

La Liga president Javier Tebas has insisted several times that the season will be completed once the situation improves.

""It is vital for Barcelona's financial stability,"" sources from the club told ESPN while pointing out the large amount of revenue potentially earned in Champions League. ""Other clubs that have already done their job but Barca must keep fighting for the La Liga title and for continuing to advance in the Champions League.""

So far, Barcelona have generated €22.1m from the group stage of the Champions League and could add a further €37.5m further if they reach the final. A victory would provide €4m more to the Camp Nou coffers with an extra €3.5m for playing in the UEFA Super Cup.

The target is to cushion the financial impact that Barcelona and the rest of Spanish and European clubs are suffering due to the football games' suspension.

Barca have closed their official stores, the club's museum, worldwide academies, and Camp Nou itself -- therefore earning no money from ticketing or VIP boxes.

Sources have told ESPN that Barcelona have found an important way of income from the marketing department as the kits sale have increased online but that money is not enough to make up the numbers."

We’re also learning and developing predictive tools to help us figure out how to take care of our patients. For example, a very popular tool called [MDCalc by Graham Walker](https://www.mdcalc.com/covid-19#calcs) just came out based on the science to help us make decisions based on data of when to admit the patients and when to send them home. This will continue to evolve in the next week. The difference in what we could state in our AMA this week just from last is already exponentially better and I anticipate it will continue trending in that direction. Specifically for prior pneumonia? We're not sure. However, we do have enough information to make some guesses and paint a picture of what this disease looks like for most people:

**If you’re on the mild trajectory.**
* Day 1: The first symptom is usually a fever. You might have fatigue, muscle aches, and a dry cough. 
* Day 5: You might get worse shortness of breath at this point, especially if you have other medical problems. 
* Day 17: The symptoms continue, but get milder and milder until you get fully better. The trajectory is a lot like a flu, and how bad it is depends on your baseline health.

**If you’re on the critically ill trajectory**

* Day 1: The first symptom is usually a fever still. You might have fatigue, muscle aches, and a dry cough. Some patients are particularly susceptible with diarrhea and abdominal pain. We think this cohort does worse than the rest (diarrhea).
* Day 5: Your symptoms continue and it feels like a flu. You might get worse shortness of breath at this point, especially if you have other medical problems. 
* Day 7: At this point in other countries, people are admitted to the hospital. You have Dyspnea, which is shortness of breath while speaking. This is usually the symptom that we make that has patients admitted to the hospital
* Day 8: ARDS, acute respiratory distress syndrome, where a significant amount of fluid builds up in the lungs from leaky capillaries, builds up. This is while you are in the ICU and on a ventilator. At this point you worsen to death or you improve in the ICU. This is the critical time for improvement or worsening.
* 17 days later: On average, the people who make a full recovery from the virus after discharge from the hospital do so after 2.5 weeks. 

So far we don’t know if the things we’ve seen in Italy and China will apply here in the USA. We’re still around day 14 for the first smaller clusters, especially in Boston. It might feel like an eternity ago, but in Boston the first cluster linked to the Biogen cluster was March 8th, almost 2 weeks ago. 

To give all a sense of how rapidly this is changing, on 3/19 the first cohort of data came out of Washington State that looked at these patients. We are still digesting this and rapidly learning new things.

In the U.S., wild deer can carry diseases which have the potential to be passed on to humans and are supposed to be tested before being consumed.

We've been using a housekeeping service for about 10 years. Every two weeks, like clockwork, a very nice group of ladies come and do the floors, vacuum, clean the bathrooms, dust, and all the rest of it. We decided to put everything on hold for the next month (at least) until we see how this all starts to shake out. As of now, my job (and my husband's) are both safe. Because of that, we were able to still pay for the 2 times we'll miss, and so I sent the woman who owns the business a check earlier in the week. Small businesses are really being hit hard, and I wanted to do my part to try and help her get through this.

The cleaning ladies always bring all their own stuff. And because we've been using them for so long, that meant I had no cleaning supplies at all, and I had to order a bunch from Amazon.

GTM is also valuable in part because it doesn't try to teach you any substantive material. Lots of 0Ls (including me) read a hornbook or try to get ahead of reading for their 1L classes but as any current student can tell you it's basically a waste of time.

He doesn’t even save himself. Instead, Jesus descends deep into our humanity to share it with us for love’s sake.

The system is deeply entrenched and secure - stop waiting for the b00gal00 or next election cycle to save you or whatever other panacea. The right controls no avenues to power other than the MIC and some dying old neoconservative holdouts in the corporate world. Power flows down. We are not in control. Crises like coronavirus open up society to large changes. Those changes may or may not be in our favor, but we won't be the ones making the decisions.

Blackpill right? It's just reality. The right would be better suited to confronting that reality.

**Build.** Build social structures and infrastructure. Build intellectual paths forward. Build communities. Build art. Build culture. Build charities. Build organizations. Build reputation. Build youth services. Build elderly services. Build ideology. Build a worldview. Build an intellectual community of *elites*. We have to win over the minds of those with power. We need elites, not plebeians. **Give up on participating in political theatre.** It's a distraction and keeps people believing they have power when they don't. You make it sound like we've tried and failed. *We never tried.* The only thing we've done is delude ourselves that the election every 2 years matters, our stupid little protests matters, or our any other type of direct involvement in politics matters.

The coronavirus has a typical incubation period of just over 5 days, and it obviously worsens over time for those who require ICU. So the peak is gonna be somewhere around 5 (incubation period) + average time between hospitalization and death (no idea this number, but I’m sure it’s more than 7 days) from whenever the lockdown effort started. So, unfortunately, the peak is probably not going to be until sometime next week or the weak after, depending on whatever that average timeframe is..."

Also the data so far suggest China's data is actually accurate due to extensive testing after the lockdown: [https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2762130](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2762130), western media rarely report the big jump in cases in China around Feb 13th, on that day Chinese government announced that anyone will be admitted into hospital for Coronavirus treatment even if there is no test result, as long as their doctor suspect it is the case, so that all the people who needs treatment can get it. Surprisingly I never seen any english report about it. Also, try finding a scientist in western media, either from WHO or academic world outside of China, actually finding Chinese data inaccurate. Why? Most people listen media without reading data themselves. 

Also, tons of map App began to provide real time tracking info around late January for recent cases near people's location, so that you can make sure you are not a close contact of some one tested positive. This is the way China is able to quickly track down any potential patient. This is never reported by any western media for some reason.

The hottest topic for Chinese oversea for last 3-4 weeks is how to find airline tickets to fly back to China. I call it ""vote by feet"", ask yourself this question: why is Chinese people oversea, that get both info from western media and Chinese media believes Chinese government's data?

A) some panic buyers that live paycheck to paycheck are buying more than they can really afford and they'd want to return it for a short term cash flow.

B) the people that bought specifically to price gouge on eBay or Craigslist are screwed because they sunk hundreds or thousands into it and now can't get any more than retail legally, so at best a waste of time for a total wash in revenue.

And yes, this is only stage 1 of the Coronavirus problem.  Once the cases have subsided and we've reached the downslope in new cases, we'll have a major wave of economic fuckery where businesses that operate on a month to month revenue stream will quickly go deep in to debt and probably shutter, which will lead to loan defaults that will ripple up and down the economic ladder and basically affect everyone.  Governments will probably have to issue a fuckton of low or no interest loans to a substantial part of the population of every country to prevent a complete economic collapse if this holds up for much more than a month.

They are trying to give cash, not loans, to American citizens, contra your post.

If you google ""coronavirus children sick"" dozens of articles about this study come up.

Most of them probably get symptoms (mild ones), and around 6% of them may require hospitalization. Perhaps 25-50% are asymptomatic, but there's 0 evidence whatsoever that shows the vast majority of kids get 0 symptoms at all. 

If tens of millions of children get it, tens of thousands will die, especially when hospitals are overwhelmed. That is a mathematical fact. Even if it's just 0.1%. Mortality rates for kids 0-18 probably won't be much different from adults 20-29. Does anyone REALLY believe ZERO kids 0-9 died in China?

Coworker that's been in the shop for 15 years decided to leave today, at least.. I'm worried he did, I'm afraid to ask him. I parked behind the shop beside him this morning and he was waiting in his car, told me he didn't know anymore if he wanted to come in or not.

He's been enduring shit from the foreman in the shop for too many years, and he's come to tolerate his meddling by ignoring him and keeping out of his business. Even managed to get the 'foreman' title removed from the guy by threatening to leave some years ago, but he still does the same shit. Guy's just a welder but he struts like he owns the place, has the big boss in his pocket, fishing buddies and all.

Big boss had a meeting yesterday morning asking us to let the 'old grudges' aside and help each other out in the tough times coming and he took it personally, as it's pretty much the only feud there is in the shop. Everyone knows. small shop and all...

Left the shop yesterday after the meeting without saying shit to anybody in the shop. Told dispatch he didn't feel well and had to go home. He told later on fb he was fucking pissed and needed out to relax and not say shit he'd regret.
Well meanwhile Mr. fucking foreman goes around the shop and tells me and the others to watch ourselves for signs of coronavirus since we were working close the whole week and he left 'not feeling good'. Fucker got the panic set in the shop, and kicked the rumor mill in 2nd gear.

Told this to my coworker this morning when he was waiting in his car. It's probably the last thing he wanted to hear, but I thought it fair to keep him in on what was said behind his back. He told me thanks, for helping him make up his mind, and drove off.

I feel like I did a terrible mistake, and am somehow responsible for the choice he's gonna make, or did this morning. I just hope he finds happiness, here or elsewhere.."

The incubation for COVID-19 is 5-19 days. The flu is 4 days. This is part of what makes the Coronavirus more contagious with the R0. 

19% of people who get the virus require hospitalization while less than 1% for for the flu. 

All of these combined make for an extremely likely scenario in which we overload our health care system. It is only designed to handle a max of ~0.5-1% of the population in critical circumstances. Our current models from epidemiology experts project scenarios of 25-75 million people becoming infected. 19% of the more conservative end of the spectrum at 25 million infected would be 4.75 million people in hospitals or 1.5% of the population. 

The current death rate will only increase as medical supplies thin and people are turned away from the care that they need. Certain areas like New York have hospitals with less than one week worth of supplies already. 

For the reasons above and many, many more, the comparison to the flu is ludicrous."

2020-03-20,hilltopye,Coronavirus,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/flzr1z/ethicists_agree_on_who_gets_treated_first_when/fl1fqtb/,"Pandemics bring ethical dilemmas into sharp, terrible focus. Around the world, hospitals have been unable to cope with the millions who need treatment for coronavirus. China created makeshift hospitals and denied treatment to those who needed non-coronavirus care; Italians wait an hour on the phone to get through to emergency services. Few countries will fare better: The United States has fewer than 100,000 ICU beds, and is expected to need a minimum of 200,000 to cope with coronavirus; the UK has just 8,200 ventilators and is getting an extra 3,800.

As health care systems are overwhelmed with more patients than they can feasibly treat, medical personnel are forced to decide who should get the available ventilators and ICU beds. Quartz spoke with eight ethicists, all of whom agreed that in such dire situations, those who have the best chance of surviving get priority. Despite the unanimity, all agreed that this decision is far from easy and should not be taken lightly.

Different moral theories, same answer

The decision to prioritize those with good survival odds is reinforced by several moral theories. Utilitarianism, for example, argues that morality is determined by the consequences of actions, and so we should strive to create the maximum good for the maximum number of people. “If we give scarce treatments to those who don’t stand to benefit (and have a high chance of dying anyway), then not only will they die, but those with higher likelihood of survival (but require ventilator support) will also die,” says Lydia Dugdale, professor of medicine and director of the center for clinical medical ethics at Columbia University. “It’s not fair to distribute scarce resources in a way that minimizes lives saved.”

A contractarian theory, which bases ethics on the social contract we would agree to if we didn’t know our status in society, arrives at the same conclusion. Joshua Parker, a trainee general practitioner (primary care doctor) who co-wrote an article on the ethics of coronavirus care for the Journal of Medical Ethics, points to philosopher John Rawls’ concept of a “veil of ignorance” as a way to determine the just action: “Behind the veil of ignorance, I am stripped of any knowledge of my position. I don’t know if I’ll be old, young, rich, poor, well, unwell, male or female; and I don’t know if I will catch COVID-19 or if I do, what resources I will need,” he writes in an email to Quartz. This thought experiment makes it easier to judge what’s fair for society as a whole. Alex John London, director of the Center for Ethics and Policy at Carnegie Mellon University, agrees: “Such agents might agree that in a pandemic, when not everyone can be saved, health care systems should use their resources to save as many lives as possible—because that is the strategy that allows each person a fair chance of being able to pursue their life plan.”

Even typically diverging ethical theories are likely to point to this conclusion. Utilitarianism, which focuses on the consequences of an action, is typically opposed to deontology, which says morality is determined by the act itself. “The deontologist might well start with a justice argument: each person is individually valuable and should have an equal chance of health care,” says Anders Sandberg, a philosopher at the Future of Humanity Institute at the Oxford University. But if this is simply impossible, then the theory doesn’t hold. “As Kant said, “ought implies can,” and if one cannot do an action it cannot be obligatory.” A deontologist approach to treat everyone equally falls short when there simply isn’t enough medical equipment to treat everyone; if some will have access and some won’t, then we have to face the question of who gets preferential treatment. And so “even the most die-hard deontologist will usually agree” that it’s wrong to treat people who are unlikely to benefit while others are in need, agrees Brian D. Earp, associate director of the Yale-Hastings Program in Ethics and Health Policy at Yale University and The Hastings Center.

Doctors have reckoned with the need to allocate resources in the face of overwhelming demand long before coronavirus. Dugdale points out that the New York department of health’s ventilator allocation guidelines, published in November 2015 to address the issue amid a flu epidemic, states that first-come first-serve, lottery, physician clinical judgment, and prioritizing certain patients such as health care workers were explored but found to be either too subjective or failed to save the most lives. Age was rejected as a criterion as it discriminates against the elderly, and there are plenty of cases in which an older person has better odds of survival than someone younger.

So the decision was to “utilize clinical factors only to evaluate a patient’s likelihood of survival and to determine the patient’s access to ventilator therapy.” In tie-breaking circumstances, though, they did approve treating children 17 and younger over an adult where both have an equal odds of surviving. Dugdale adds that there’s talk of applying these guidelines to address coronavirus treatment in New York.

No good answer

The dire consequences of any decision made under such extreme circumstances means that, despite agreement, the best course of action is hardly favorable. “I would say that leaving some to die without treatment is NOT ethical, but it may be necessary as there are no good options,” David Chan, philosophy professor at the University of Alabama at Birmingham, writes. “Saying that it is ethical ignores the tragic element, and it is better that physicians feel bad about making the best of a bad situation rather than being convinced that they have done the right thing.”

Rather, it’s simply the least bad option. Alternatives, such as a lottery system or prioritizing the sickest, are likely to lead to more deaths. “There is a good chance that we invest resources into patients who don’t survive, and we have thus doomed not just the patient we tried to save, but also the patient who was passed over for care, because the resources have been used up,” says Vanessa Bentley, philosophy professor at the University of Alabama at Birmingham. “Lives that could have been saved were lost.”

Although there’s broad agreement on the best approach, the nuances of applying this decision will always be difficult. Not only must doctors accurately assess and prioritize those with the best chance of survival, but there could also be times when the hospital doesn’t have enough equipment to help even those with equal odds. Italy has prioritized treatment for those with “the best chance of success” but adds as a second criterion those “who have more potential years of life.” This secondary factor is not so easily agreed upon but, in the face of coronavirus, it’s an ethical question doctors will have to face."

I want to discuss this point specifically. In the past week alone I have been reached out to something like 500 times by people with really unique talents, skills and abilities to help. I absolutely am floored with the care and dedication people have. I posted this below in a Facebook group and I think it bears worth repeating here: We have a lot of needs, and here is how I think people can be most helpful:

1) Focus on consumers. Can you provide PPE that decreases demand from the private sector to maximize supply among the medical community? We are in critically short supply and our husbands/wives/loved ones are starting to make us masks. Before I would have wondered if it really is kosher for me to wear a homemade mask between patient to patient. Now I know that might be a reality. But I beg people to try to save the N95's for us. Of the patients I saw in the ER the other night, something like 60% had COVID. We see many of them and are at very high risk. Increased production of other types of masks would be incredibly helpful for this effort. 

2) Education among the population: can you find ways to decrease barriers to understanding and maximize responsible actions like social distancing, hand hygiene, and self-quarantine? This AMA by itself is incredibly helpful. Please keep spreading the message.

3) Issues with self-quarantine: Can you assist with technology that can make self-quarantine more tolerable, humane, easy for those most vulnerable in the population? (homeless, etc). The truth is the most vulnerable in our society will not be able to self-quarantine, perpetuating infections.

4) Childcare: Schools are closed and many healthcare providers have families. If healthcare providers cannot care for their children, they cannot go to work. This is a major issue being discussed in healthcare right now. Something that we discussed in our recent AMA:

""I do want to mention that closing schools has a HUGE impact on us and everyone in healthcare. Both my wife and I work in healthcare... if our schools close, how do we both continue to see patients when one of us has to stay home with the kids? Sure, we can afford sitters, but demand is high and - more importantly - many of our coworkers (from nurses to the very important environmental staff that disinfect rooms of infected patients) often cannot. The decision to close schools can have far-reaching impact beyond the kids who are students at them.""

Death rate of 20-29 bracket is around 0.2%, although that data unfortunately doesn't split between comorbidities. But it's reasonable to assume, since the death rate of people without comorbidities is around 0.9%, that at least one person with no comorbitities died. I've found an article about a health 27 year old person dying, but it's from The Sun, which I don't consider a trusted source.

We could argue about what is considered a comorbitity (smoking?) and if a ""healthy"" person that died did in fact have an unknown comorbitity or not, but I don't think that would be a useful discussion.

My point is that being young does not mean you'll definitely survive, the same that being old and fragile doesn't mean you'll die, as the post about the 98 year old that survived COVID shows."

Interesting article by TIME. The reduction in emissions from China likely wasnt the result of less cars but the result of some factories shutting down.

\- Un vaccin, quand on arrive à en faire, met environ 2 ans à sortir (sauf miracle)

\- Un virus ne s'arrête que très difficilement sans vaccin.

Voilà, ça c'est la règle générale. Maintenant, il existe des antiviraux, il existe des solutions alternatives, mais pour encore faire très simple, c'est très facile d'avoir des résultats encourageants (cf la chloroquine et toutes les actualités qui nous rappellent tous les jours qu'on trouve 5000 médicaments potentiels) mais c'est très difficile d'avoir des résultats concrets (cf l'Italie et la Chine qui sont pas forcément des crétins et qui ont pas forcément des systèmes de santé déplorables et qui ont quand même probablement 1% de décès)

C'est clairement une course contre la montre, mais la recherche y compris médicale ne fonctionne absolument pas comme ça. Dans plein de problème en économie, t'as un soucis? Tu mets davantage de pognon et ça marche. Dans la recherche c'est vrai mais pour dans 5 à 10ans. Aujourd'hui la situation d'avant est figée. Et avant on avait quoi? Pas beaucoup de connaissances sur les coronavirus (beaucoup moins que sur le VIH ou sur le cancer évidemment), pas de vaccin sur les coronavirus etc.. Là les chercheurs tentent des approches standardisées, ils tentent d'ancien médicaments qui marchaient avant, ils vont tenter d'appliquer la méthodologie classique des vaccins aux coronavirus. Mais tous ces trucs basiques qu'on fait dans plein de situation ont pas spécialement de raisons de bien marcher pour ce virus. On peut avoir de la chance et ça marchera (genre si la chloroquine s'avère fonctionnelle ou si on a aucun obstacle sur le vaccin), et on peut avoir pas de chance et même d'ici 2ans absolument rien ne marchera (genre on déjà eu un covid-2003 et un mers-sras, et pour certains virus genre le VIH ça fait 40ans qu'on cherche un vaccin).

Oui mobiliser tous les chercheurs du monde ça a un impact, mais cet impact est bien moindre que ce qu'on peut croire."

They received warnings from local police, but that was not arrested in any means. And they kept working after received the warning. Dr. Li Wenliang received the warning on 3rd Jan, and got infected from a patient on 8th Jan. If he was arrested, he would not be infected, and he could save his life. 

If you check the timeline now, the virus was first informed by another doctor Zhang Jixian on 27th Dec. Dr Li Wenliang told his friend about the virus on 30th Dec. China informed WHO about pneumonia on 31st. The first batch of specialists sent into Wuhan on 31st. Dr. Li got the warning on 3rd Jan. China informed US on 3rd Jan. China announced that the pneumonia was caused by novel coronavirus on 8th Jan.   

Did Wuhan local authority suppress information? Yes, they did. They should already know the new disease might be caused by coronavirus between 27th Dec to 30th. They should inform all the medical workers to protect themself. They could save hundreds of medical workers' life!  But they did nothing! They also lied to the specialists sent by the central government,  they didn't want to share information with those specialists at the beginning. All the Chinese, I mean almost everyone, hate Wuhan local authority. They f-ing messed everything up! 

But let's back to Li Wenliang. Would the current situation be any better if he was not been warned? I highly doubt it. China had already taken action before Dr. Li was warned. 

The warning Dr. Li received was a tragedy. Dr. Li's death was a tragedy. But at the end of the day, Dr. Li did not and could not help the situation be any better. 

I just hope Dr. Li's tragedy can warn CCP, the current epidemic prevention system is a joke. If the right to speak about any new disease is controlled by the local CDC, which is controlled by the local authority, the same tragedy will happen again. All the epidemic prevention system should directly report to the central government.

The department “is shifting from a strategy of case containment to slowing disease transmission and averting excess morbidity and mortality,” according to the letter.

And from the [CDC report](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/69/wr/mm6912e2.htm?s_cid=mm6912e2_w)

> Among 2,449 patients with known age, 6% were aged ≥85, 25% were aged 65–84 years, 18% each were aged 55–64 years and 45–54 years, and 29% were aged 20–44 years (Figure 2). Only 5% of cases occurred in persons aged 0–19 years.

The mortality is still clustered almost entirely among the elderly (85 & up).

My questions:

How much would mortality rise among younger demographics due to insufficient medical care (eg due to overcrowding, understaffing, lack of ICU beds and ventilators)?

And — How do these demographics compare with those in other countries? What explains the difference? Are the young in America taking less precautions? Are they more likely to be working? Some other factor?

One being to free up medical personnel for addressing the coronavirus response. The hospitals will likely need everyone from private practice to help out.

With dentists and their hygienists, they work in your mouth in very close proximity. It probably makes them very high risk for catching and transmitting the disease.

Psychologists, on the other hand, could do one-on-one therapy and maintain social distancing recommendations. And while psychiatrists could perhaps help in the hospitals with coronavirus care, must therapists don't have that kind of medical training."

Fear in this situation is natural. You're going to feel it, and that's okay. Accept it. Let yourself sob in the car for a while.

So let's look at the facts. You interacted with someone who interacted with someone who has this coronavirus. That means you might have caught it. We can work with that. Take the next reasonable steps to set everything up so you can quarantine and protect others around you. Do your part in reducing the spread and impact.

>Likewise, Camacho explained that he himself spoke with Sampedro on Sunday morning and he told him that there was a ""complex"" situation, that the situation was ""desperate"", and that they were ""overwhelmed"", as well as the fact that in that moment the home had no resident doctor, because he had left, and that the workers did not have personal protective equipment (PPE), which had to be supplied by the Castilla-La Mancha government.

>A situation in which the General Directorate of Public Health was given the appropriate instructions so that in the same morning - Sunday, March 15 - a team of doctors and nurses travelled to the center, to which another one would join in the afternoon, who were replaced by a team of doctors and nurses from Sunday to Monday night. In total three teams of doctor and nurse, Camacho stressed, were doing ""the complete triage of the 75 patients who at that time had symptoms in different states of severity.""

>A completely different version of that offered by the director of the 'Elder' home, against whom the regional government has already announced its intention to take legal action to clarify the causes of death of the fifteen residents.

>Until only just two days ago, Sampedro himself claimed that the residence was ""working normally"" on social networks.

>Regarding the medical vehicle that is parked at the entrance of the 'Elder' home, he explained that it was ""from the hospital"" and that it was there because he was ""verifying that all the residents are well and testing them for COVID-19"", the which, he insisted, ""is being done in all [elderly] homes.""

>Instead, the health team had come owing to the lack of medical personnel in the residence, after the latter reported the deaths and the presence of coronavirus symptoms among the residents. Despite this, Sampedro concluded by inviting any family member who needed information to call him - the message included his phone number - before finishing with the words ""But everything is fine!!!!!!""."

Inhofe said he is not involved in his investment decisions. The senator asked his financial adviser in December 2018 to move his portfolio entirely out of stocks and into mutual funds in December 2018 “to avoid any appearance of controversy,” he said.

“My adviser has been doing so faithfully since that time and I am not aware of or consulted about any transactions,” Inhofe said in a statement.""

Productivity has dramatically decreased as I spend more and more time reading Reddit and epidemiology op-eds.  I'm desperately trying to defend a reduced coronavirus response.  Utilitarian calculations drift through my head as I justify the deaths of hundreds of thousands of olds.  Posts disparaging others for improperly socially distancing make me roll my eyes harder than the shrill complaints of a self-righteous NIMBY.


I want to get out.  Please, I'll do anything.  But my rage manifests as inaction as I sit another day in my room, contemplating dumb yolo option plays, collecting my paycheck, and anxiously waiting for the coronabux I don't deserve.


But what will others do that aren't as privileged? How will they react to joblessness? To sitting around their house powerless, unable to participate in the economy?


I don't know, but the corona fear-mongerers will find out soon enough.  I feel like I'm at least a week in the future, as other states will one-by-one face the new work from home and quarantine reality.


I open up the Robinhood app again and search for the QQQ calls that have been in my dreams this week.  Do I just want to feel like I know something they don't?  That this will all be over soon?  My finger hovers over the buy button.
