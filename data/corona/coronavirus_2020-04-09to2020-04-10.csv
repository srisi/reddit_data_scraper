It was bad for his blood pressure-- his doctor warned him many years ago. Marty was stubborn; it was hard enough to get him to go for a regular checkup in the first place, let alone actually follow through with any medical advice. Marty always thought he knew best. 

""This whole coronavirus bs,"" he muttered under his breath, ""when is all this nonsense going to be over?"" He lamented to his wife of 23 years. TV news drolled  ambivalently in the background. You could hear the neighborhood birds, chirping in the thawing springtime; but Marty couldn't enjoy it. The stillness of the quarentine secretly bothered him; the busy sounds of traffic, the oily squeak of air brakes hissing from he neighborhood school bus, the distant sputtering of a John Deere riding mower-- to him, they were sounds of tranquility, of routine, warm familiarity, the hums of productive stability in a clean and safe suburb. That world seemed so distant, but it was less than a month ago. 

""I really should give that libtard teacher a piece of my mind,"" he smirked, putting down his coffee mug. He pulled out his iPhone 4s and adjusted his drug store quality reading glasses. He pulled the phone screen back and forth until his eyes could focus. 

Marty tapped the easily recognizable dark blue Facebook icon, on the eighth page of his phone screen, an unorganized littered mess of apps; the out-of-focus oddly cropped background screen of the family dog only added to the chaos of digital clutter. 

He started typing away, chipping away on his qwerty keyboard with a single pointer finger on his dominant hand. With every painfully slow keystroke, was the signature Apple click sound with a volume at its highest setting. Click............click......click.........click.

The only time the sounds would move any faster than a snail's pace were the occasional rapid taps of the backspace button, at least for the typos, capitalization, and grammatical errors he actually noticed. 

Halfway through his status update, he'd gotten distracted. A new, fresh, bright red notification. A half finished two genders joke would be temporarily abandoned.

It was a new message from the Neighbor Watch Group. Apparently there'd been an unfamiliar black teenage skulking around the development, but Marty wasn't able to read the full message. When he tilted his phone to read the text better, his phone was doing that thing again. When the screen rotates horizontally even though he's holding it vertically, then rotates vertically when he turns it horizontally. 

""Dumb chinese phone,"" he huffed, still struggling to correct his screen orientation. His son, still sleeping at the computer chair. His son had a gift, a way with electronic gadgets, if only he applied himself more to his school or ""essential"" job position at the neighborhood Dunkin', making a good dollar above minimum wage. 

Marty debated if he should wake him up now for impromptu tech support, or wait until this liberal schooling nonsense lesson plan was over first. 

Marty decided on the latter. He shuffled slowly in his garage, still wearing his house slippers, retreating to the one space in the house he had to call his own. His ""man cave"" as the Mrs called it.

It had everything he needed. A tidy workshop of tools. A bulky white fridge from the 1970s full of domestic beer and frozen steaks. Behind the bookshelf, some of his old Playboys. Marty made sure the door was locked, and dug around for the March 1981 issue featuring Kymberly Herrin, who other early accidental hormonal boner-inducing work included Ghostbusters and the ZZ Top music video ""Legs"". 

Marty took his favorite fan belt off of his work bench; he used to use thick rubber bands, but they kept breaking. He wrapped the warped, slightly oily fanbelt around his droopy gray sack of genitalia; a field of wispy einstein pubes stood at attention, a wrinkly pruned crease in his fleshy beanbag, wrapped tightly like a frog's throat. Marty liked to wrap it tight enough to turn purple and throb. He took two generous fingers worth of gooey white turtle wax, and spread the chemical burning sensation throughout the folds of his four and a half inch erection. The smooth vaseline legs of Ms. Herrin still looked as youthful as he remembered, albeit the pages a bit more chummed together and slightly bleached from the furious fistful of a thousand misfired loads from his cum cannon.  Marty liked to torture and mutualite his genitalia as much as he liked the sensation of strange objects deep inside his anal cavity. This time, it was front end of his Callaway sand wedge; it stuck out of his dropped khakis like a skeleton framed musical note. He dared not get too loud, no matter how excited he got, so he bite down on his favorite multi purpose rag, the tops of his crowns grinding against the old sops of turpentine. 

After a few minutes of manic tugging, and nearly fainting, his knees buckled. Eggshell yellow ejaculate  dribbled out of his gonnarhea motel, making subtle new stains on the floor of the oily garage. 

Except he did pass out; the Mrs heard an usual thud and found Marty face-down and ass-up with his cheek inadvertantly mopping up his low-sperm count sebum. The golf club had popped out of his asshole and was now covered with a streak of turd long enough to make a Charmin Bear jealous. 

""Dang it Marty,"" she murmured; it was a scene she was all too familiar with. She helped him stop his mild nosebleed. They both knew what happens next; A new pair of shoes would make this incident all but forgotten. Without a word, and a revealing resignation of a sigh, he handed the Mrs the family credit card. 

They say hindsight is 20/20. Looking back, Marty wished he would've just woken up his son."

They're even running out of the medications to sedate patients for intubation. This is about rationing resources - all resources: people, PPE, medications, beds, ventilators, etc - that we need for modern medical care because there has been and is an enormous medical strain on the system.

We're \*lucky\* some of the hospitals are at 50% capacity or less, we wouldn't have the ventilators, medications, or PPE equipment for the whole country to continue having hospitals as full as they were with elective surgeries AND COVID patients. Nevermind the issue of elective surgeries and people who go through them being very vulnerable to disease or infection during recovery.

Please also look up the US ratio of elective to emergency procedures (edit here is a source:  [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29270649](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29270649) which indicates there are many more elective surgeries to emergency surgeries, in the US Ee ratio is 9.4  ""Ee ratio which represents the number of emergency surgeries performed for every 100 elective surgeries"" - in layman terms we freed up a shit ton of hospital beds and reduced using medical resources). By canceling elective surgeries we freed up significant amounts of beds and if we continued them we would be over capacity at many hospital systems. We also stopped using resources. Typically in the US ""only 36% of these beds were unoccupied on a typical day, leaving just 0.8 unoccupied beds per 1,000 people.""( original source: [https://www.urban.org/research/publication/hospital-readiness-covid-19-analysis-bed-capacity-and-how-it-varies-across-country](https://www.urban.org/research/publication/hospital-readiness-covid-19-analysis-bed-capacity-and-how-it-varies-across-country) )  If we're at 50% capacity now, and its only emergency procedures, then clearly we would have had been over capacity without canceling elective surgeries and making the spread of the virus worse.

Additionally "" Stanford Anesthesiologist Dr. Alyssa Burgart, noting that [41 percent of cases of COVID-19 in Wuhan were likely hospital acquired](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32031570), points to the primary reason that the system seems slow to cancel elective cases — namely that elective surgeries and colonoscopies account for almost $500 billion in revenue for the over 50 million procedures performed annually.  "" Clearly hospitals would choose to do this if they could, they can't, they don't have the resources needed for medical procedures and it would be irresponsible as it would likely spread COVID to more people.

Talk about hivemind mentality, I hear people complaining about /r/coronavirus and here we are with everyone piling on to ""hospitals are at 50% or less in some areas"" yet completely ignoring the reality of the fact that we're incredible short on medical supplies in the US as well as world wide due to the enormous demand this has caused for medical resources of all sorts. Hospital beds are only \*one type\* of medical resource."

&#x200B;

1. The WHO claimed there is no human to human transmission:  

\[[https://nypost.com/2020/03/20/who-haunted-by-old-tweet-saying-china-found-no-human-transmission-of-coronavirus/](https://nypost.com/2020/03/20/who-haunted-by-old-tweet-saying-china-found-no-human-transmission-of-coronavirus/)\]([https://nypost.com/2020/03/20/who-haunted-by-old-tweet-saying-china-found-no-human-transmission-of-coronavirus/](https://nypost.com/2020/03/20/who-haunted-by-old-tweet-saying-china-found-no-human-transmission-of-coronavirus/))

2. The WHO claimed that the Wuhan Virus is not a pandemic:  

\[[https://www.forbes.com/sites/lisettevoytko/2020/02/04/who-says-coronavirus-is-not-a-pandemic-despite-increase-in-cases-and-deaths/#6019f3ee44ce](https://www.forbes.com/sites/lisettevoytko/2020/02/04/who-says-coronavirus-is-not-a-pandemic-despite-increase-in-cases-and-deaths/#6019f3ee44ce)\]([https://www.forbes.com/sites/lisettevoytko/2020/02/04/who-says-coronavirus-is-not-a-pandemic-despite-increase-in-cases-and-deaths/#6019f3ee44ce](https://www.forbes.com/sites/lisettevoytko/2020/02/04/who-says-coronavirus-is-not-a-pandemic-despite-increase-in-cases-and-deaths/#6019f3ee44ce))

3. The WHO ignored Taiwans findings at how to combat and deal with the virus just to please china:

4. The WHO still claims that travel bans are not necessary despite the fact that Taiwan has been using them and having great success with it:  

\[[https://www.who.int/news-room/articles-detail/updated-who-recommendations-for-international-traffic-in-relation-to-covid-19-outbreak](https://www.who.int/news-room/articles-detail/updated-who-recommendations-for-international-traffic-in-relation-to-covid-19-outbreak)\]([https://www.who.int/news-room/articles-detail/updated-who-recommendations-for-international-traffic-in-relation-to-covid-19-outbreak](https://www.who.int/news-room/articles-detail/updated-who-recommendations-for-international-traffic-in-relation-to-covid-19-outbreak))

5. The WHO denies the existence of Taiwan to please China:  

\[[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/30/senior-who-adviser-appears-to-dodge-question-on-taiwans-covid-19-response](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/30/senior-who-adviser-appears-to-dodge-question-on-taiwans-covid-19-response)\]([https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/30/senior-who-adviser-appears-to-dodge-question-on-taiwans-covid-19-response](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/30/senior-who-adviser-appears-to-dodge-question-on-taiwans-covid-19-response))

6. WHO praised Chinas inhumane efforts to contain virus:  

\[[https://khn.org/morning-breakout/who-praises-chinas-draconian-measures-balks-at-labeling-outbreak-a-pandemic-even-as-cases-spike-globally/](https://khn.org/morning-breakout/who-praises-chinas-draconian-measures-balks-at-labeling-outbreak-a-pandemic-even-as-cases-spike-globally/)\]([https://khn.org/morning-breakout/who-praises-chinas-draconian-measures-balks-at-labeling-outbreak-a-pandemic-even-as-cases-spike-globally/](https://khn.org/morning-breakout/who-praises-chinas-draconian-measures-balks-at-labeling-outbreak-a-pandemic-even-as-cases-spike-globally/))

&#x200B;

Anyone defending the WHO at this point is in denial. Yes of course countries/goverments could have prepared better but fact is that the WHO has majorly dropped the ball on this one. I cannot imagine that there will be no consequences for them after what happened.

Unlike others, I do not believe this will cause an inflation problem. 2008 saw a quadrupling in the money supply; however, banks simply accumulated excess reserves and sat on it. Now, since all financial assets are up for grabs (including corporate bonds), the market has an unprecedented amount of cash looking to spend it on something. In fact, the worse the economy becomes, the more cash there is looking to be invested into things like equities. 

Of course, the bullish case is also tenuous at best, considering that the market is almost certainly overvalued compared to the projected outputs half a year to a year out. 

My conclusion is to be a bull in the short run until the markets seem to become sensitive to bad news. Track market sentiment over time. Coronavirus could be projected to kill 10,000 more people tomorrow and the market probably would not care. Unemployment could be 20 million Americans tomorrow. The market probably would, at worst, react in a lukewarm manner."

""An estimated additional 180 - 195 deaths per day occurring at home in New York City due to COVID-19 are not being counted in the official figures. ""Early on in this crisis we were able to swab people who died at home, and thus got a coronavirus reading. But those days are long gone. We simply don't have the testing capacity for the large numbers dying at home. Now only those few who had a test confirmation *before* dying are marked as victims of coronavirus on their death certificate.

""A study by disease modelers at the University of Texas at Austin states that ""Given the low testing rates throughout the country, we assume that 1 in 10 cases are tested and reported. If a county has detected only 1 case of COVID-19, there is a 51%
chance that there is already a growing outbreak underway"" [source]""

I never suggested ending lockdowns now. I said we should discuss the ""balance of harms"" of extending lockdowns past the peak surges in the U.S. and into May. You've illustrated my point when I wrote that we can't even discuss this *""because that requires a nuanced understanding of how epidemic peaks actually work.""* Remaining ignorant of the increasing number of preventable deaths every additional day of lockdown in May will cause isn't morally defensible. Three billion humans are under mandatory lockdowns and it's already causing disaster globally - with Oxfam saying yesterday:

> ""More than half a billion more people could be pushed into poverty unless urgent action is taken"" 

And in the U.S.

> ""Unemployment could top 32% as 47M workers are laid off amid coronavirus: St. Louis Fed""

Just because the number of displaced families and increased homelessness our precautions are causing may not impact *you*, doesn't mean it's not catastrophic to the poor and marginalized who are bearing the brunt of the consequences. Among the disadvantaged and marginalized unemployment and homelessness *are* serious health problems.

> ""When America catches coronavirus, [Black people die.](https://www.brookings.edu/blog/fixgov/2020/04/09/why-are-blacks-dying-at-higher-rates-from-covid-19/) Blacks in about every state with racial data available have higher contraction rates and higher death rates of COVID-19.  During a White House coronavirus task force briefing, Dr. Fauci, Director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases since 1984, stated, “Health disparities have always existed for the African American community… [coronavirus is] shining a bright light on how unacceptable that is because, yet again, when you have a situation like the coronavirus, they are suffering disproportionately.""

Your ability to calmly say ""People should be able to sit tight a while longer"" just refects your position of privilege. A lot of people need to work to eat and keep a roof over their children's heads - and no, government ""relief"" checks aren't enough.

> ""Millions of low-income Americans are at risk of missing out on stimulus payments""

Starting with the undocumented and the poorest who can't get any of that relief. (search the headline above as I can't link it on this sub.) Even for those that can get them, temporary handouts can't solve the problem because many of the small businesses that employ most Americans aren't coming back and [every day lockdowns are extended it gets worse.](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/hope-resilience/202004/are-covid-19-patients-risk-ptsd)

'It's striking to me that over half of us are saying right now, we're concerned about meeting our monthly obligations and close to half of people under the age of 50 are worried about laying off,' he said.""

The purpose of the lockdowns was only to ""flatten the curve"" until the first surge peak passed. You're now trying to move the goalposts after lockdowns have done their job. None of the things you mentioned are going to *dramatically* improve from where they are on May 1st by locking down another month but we'll be causing a lot of lives to be lost or destroyed on the other side. Sorry if this sounds harsh but some people's continued willful ignorance of the tragic consquences to the most marginalized people in our society is starting to seem as selfish as the spring-breakers last month who didn't care about the consequences of their actions on the elderly. Sure, I understand that for *you* the cost of continuing lockdown another month seems worthwhile.

You could ignore me, say ""who cares about other people"" and go ahead so that you can get your college acceptance. But research is a serious field, and **there are consequences for your actions**. If you really want to ignore not just my advice – but the advice of many expert epidemiologists – you have demonstrated a callous disregard for human life. I get it, you want to help in this crisis. So do I. But its best that we stick to what we know, rather than having a high-schooler rush out into the world of formal research (which, judging by your unfamiliarity with Arxiv, LaTex, and proper citation formats, your age, and the brevity of your paper, I doubt you have extensive experience with). By all means, continue exploring neural networks for the sake of learning – but don't aim for the published paper just so you can put it on your LOCI/LinkedIn.

Perhaps, you'll brush me off. Perhaps, **you'll decide that a PreStIgIoUS acceptance is more important to you than actually helping people**. **I hope you are not that person**, and I hope the MIT AOs saw something good in your character that earned you a spot on their waitlist, as someone who they would be proud to have represent/attend their school. But I hope that, if you do brush me off, you reconsider 1) your priorities and what the college admissions process has done to you as a human being and 2) whether you would be the sort of student to thrive at MIT in the first place if your own career progress is more important than the lives of others."

“Today I voted against extending the governor’s State of Emergency for several reasons:
 
1. I have received more calls and emails on this issue from constituents than any other issue in my time as state representative, with 99% opposed to extending this shutdown. I’m not sure how I could have been a good representative of the 72nd District and supported this.
 
2. The governor has been unwilling to work with the legislature on common-sense adjustments like allowing landscapers to work. Landscapers are at a very low risk for exposure due to being outside and not congregating around other people. Springtime is a key season to keep these small business owners going. Why should we extend the governor’s broad authority when she won’t consider common-sense adjustments?
 
3. There has been a complete double standard. The state can still get its construction projects done (i.e. the 100th Street Bridge), but a two-man homebuilding business can’t build houses. I’ve talked to families that have their lease expiring this spring and need a house to move into. With the homebuilding industry shutdown, they could be left homeless this summer. And yet the state government gets to continue doing their construction projects. I’ve never been a fan of having one set of rules for the government and another for the people.
 
4. Let’s have some compassion for those that are struggling financially. I’ve heard from numerous individuals that are not able to work right now and unemployment isn’t going to be enough to allow them to pay their bills. I’ve had grown adults nearly in tears because they don’t know how they are going make ends meet. I don’t see any compassion for those that are struggling financially in this shutdown order.
 
5. The big box stores are allowed to be open but smaller stores don’t get that privilege. You can go to Menards and buy plants for your yard, but the local nursery isn’t allowed to be open. They are sitting on expensive inventory that they won’t be able to sell if we can’t get them open soon. A small flooring store isn’t allowed to be open, but you can go to Home Depot and buy flooring. How is this fair? Extending this shutdown order did nothing to provide even playing field between the big box stores and our locally-owned small businesses.
 
6. Why can’t we have a regionalized approach? Clearly Detroit is where the vast majority of these cases are. Why not let parts of the state that have few if any cases remain open? Does it really make sense to shut down rural Michigan?
 
The Coronavirus is a serious virus that should not be taken lightly. However, we have to be responsible in our reaction to it. Let’s be smart while being safe.”"

Unless you're a healthcare professional and I'm in the hospital, you can get the fuck away from me if you were in proximity to an individual that tested positive for coronavirus.

I'd be more up for it if this is for people who *haven't* been in contact with someone who tested positive, but if the Federal government is directly jumping to people known to have been exposed, you can count me out. Especially since the average American public doesn't even have access to surgical masks yet, nevermind n95.

To that end we are requiring that all comments be a minimum of 5,000 characters to ensure that there is a safe distance between users at all times. Please help us by ensuring that your commentary meets this minimum requirement. Attempts to circumvent this will see users quarantined from the subreddit.

Tips For Social Distancing, Quarantine, And Isolation During An Infectious Disease Outbreak

What Is Social Distancing?

Social distancing is a way to keep people from interacting closely or frequently enough to spread an infectious disease. Schools and other gathering places such as movie theaters may close, and sports events and religious services may be cancelled.

What Is Quarantine?

Quarantine separates and restricts the movement of people who have been exposed to a contagious disease to see if they become sick. It lasts long enough to ensure the person has not contracted an infectious disease.

What Is Isolation?

Isolation prevents the spread of an infectious disease by separating people who are sick from those who are not. It lasts as long as the disease is contagious.

What To Expect: Typical Reactions

Everyone reacts differently to stressful situations such as an infectious disease outbreak that requires social distancing, quarantine, or isolation. People may feel:

•	⁠Anxiety, worry, or fear related to:
•	⁠Your own health status
•	⁠The health status of others whom you may have exposed to the disease
•	⁠The resentment that your friends and family may feel if they need to go into quarantine as a result of contact with you
•	⁠The experience of monitoring yourself, or being monitored by others for signs and symptoms of the disease
•	⁠Time taken off from work and the potential loss of income and job security
•	⁠The challenges of securing things you need, such as groceries and personal care items
•	⁠Concern about being able to effectively care for children or others in your care
•	⁠Uncertainty or frustration about how long you will need to remain in this situation, and uncertainty about the future
•	⁠Loneliness associated with feeling cut off from the world and from loved ones
•	⁠Anger if you think you were exposed to the disease because of others’ negligence
•	⁠Boredom and frustration because you may not be able to work or engage in regular day-to-day activities
•	⁠Uncertainty or ambivalence about the situation
•	⁠A desire to use alcohol or drugs to cope
•	⁠Symptoms of depression, such as feelings of hopelessness, changes in appetite, or sleeping too little or too much
•	⁠Symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), such as intrusive distressing memories, flashbacks (reliving the event), nightmares, changes in thoughts and mood, and being easily startled.

Ways To Support Yourself During Social Distancing, Quarantine, and Isolation

UNDERSTAND THE RISK

Consider the real risk of harm to yourself and others around you. The public perception of risk during a situation such as an infectious disease outbreak is often inaccurate. Media coverage may create the impression that people are in immediate danger when really the risk for infection may be very low. Take steps to get the facts:

•	⁠Stay up to date on what is happening, while limiting your media exposure. Avoid watching or listening to news reports 24/7 since this tends to increase anxiety and worry. Remember that children are especially affected by what they hear and see on television.
•	⁠Look to credible sources for information on the infectious disease outbreak.

BE YOUR OWN ADVOCATE

Speaking out about your needs is particularly important if you are in quarantine, since you may not be in a hospital or other facility where your basic needs are met. Ensure you have what you need to feel safe, secure, and comfortable.

•	⁠Work with local, state, or national health officials to find out how you can arrange for groceries and toiletries to be delivered to your home as needed.
•	⁠Inform health care providers or health authorities of any needed medications and work with them to ensure that you continue to receive those medications.

EDUCATE YOURSELF

Health care providers and health authorities should provide information on the disease, its diagnosis, and treatment.

•	⁠Do not be afraid to ask questions—clear communication with a health care provider may help reduce any distress associated with social distancing, quarantine, or isolation.
•	⁠Ask for written information when available.
•	⁠Ask a family member or friend to obtain information in the event that you are unable to secure this information on your own.

WORK WITH YOUR EMPLOYER TO REDUCE FINANCIAL STRESS

If you’re unable to work during this time, you may experience stress related to your job status or financial situation.

•	⁠Provide your employer with a clear explanation of why you are away from work.
•	⁠Contact the U.S. Department of Labor tollfree at 1-866-487-2365 about the Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA), which allows U.S. employees up to 12 weeks of unpaid leave for serious medical conditions, or to care for a family member with a serious medical condition.
•	⁠Contact your utility providers, cable and Internet provider, and other companies from whom you get monthly bills to explain your situation and request alternative bill payment arrangements as needed.

CONNECT WITH OTHERS

Reaching out to people you trust is one of the best ways to reduce anxiety, depression, loneliness, and boredom during social distancing, quarantine, and isolation. You can:

•	⁠Use the telephone, email, text messaging, and social media to connect with friends, family, and others.
•	⁠Talk “face to face” with friends and loved ones using Skype or FaceTime.
•	⁠If approved by health authorities and your health care providers, arrange for your friends and loved ones to bring you newspapers, movies, and books.
•	⁠Sign up for emergency alerts via text or email to ensure you get updates as soon as they are available.
•	⁠Call SAMHSA’s free 24-hour Disaster Distress Helpline at 1-800-985-5990, if you feel lonely or need support.
•	⁠Use the Internet, radio, and television to keep up with local, national, and world events.
•	⁠If you need to connect with someone because of an ongoing alcohol or drug problem, consider calling your local Alcoholics Anonymous or Narcotics Anonymous offices.

TALK TO YOUR DOCTOR

If you are in a medical facility, you may have access to health care providers who can answer your questions. However, if you are quarantined at home, and you’re worried about physical symptoms you or your loved ones may be experiencing, call your doctor or other health care provider:

•	⁠Ask your provider whether it would be possible to schedule remote appointments via Skype or FaceTime for mental health, substance use, or physical health needs.

USE PRACTICAL WAYS TO COPE AND RELAX

•	⁠Relax your body often by doing things that work for you-take deep breaths, stretch, meditate or pray, or engage in activities you enjoy.
•	⁠Pace yourself between stressful activities, and do something fun after a hard task.
•	⁠Talk about your experiences and feelings to loved ones and friends, if you find it helpful.
•	⁠Maintain a sense of hope and positive thinking; consider keeping a journal where you write down things you are grateful for or that are going well

A coronavirus patient was able to come off ventilation just two days after receiving [the blood plasma of people who have recovered from the virus](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2020/03/28/uk-coronavirus-patients-will-treated-blood-recovered-people/) in a breakthrough described as ""remarkable"" by scientists.

[The first trials](https://www.pnas.org/content/early/2020/04/02/2004168117) looking at whether antibodies of people who have successfully fought the virus can help others do the same found that all 10 severely ill patients made a speedy recovery.

The treatment, known as convalescent plasma (CP) therapy, was used during the 1918 Spanish Flu pandemic before vaccines or antivirals were available.

It relies on the fact that the blood of people who have recovered contains powerful antibodies trained to fight the virus.

There is currently no treatment for coronavirus, and [vaccines are unlikely to be available until the end of the year](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2020/04/06/coronavirus-qa-will-vaccine-will-testing-kits-available-expert/) at the earliest.

Researchers from the Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine said the findings suggest blood plasma therapy is a safe and promising treatment for severe Covid-19 patients, and called for larger clinical trials.

 

However, British experts said larger studies were needed to be sure that the treatment was safe and effective before being widely rolled out.

Sir Munir Pirmohamed, the president of the British Pharmacological Society, said: ""This was not a randomised trial and all patients also received other treatments, including antivirals such as remdesivir, which are currently in trials for Covid-19.""

Sir Munir added that it was also important to remember that there are potential safety concerns around the treatment, including diseases that occur through transfusion.

He said: ""Even if shown to work, scalability to treat large numbers of patients may become an issue.""

The pilot study, published in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, involved 10 patients, aged between 34 and 78, who showed severe symptoms such as shortness of breath and chest pain.

All received a transfusion of a 200ml dose of blood plasma and the researchers said all clinical symptoms, which also included fever and cough, subsided within three days.

 

The patients' liver and lung function, as well as blood oxygen levels, were also found to have improved.

The numbers of disease-fighting white blood cells **–** lymphocytes **–** also increased, and antibody levels remained high after CP transfusion, the researchers said.

One 42-year-old man, who was seriously ill and on a ventilator, was breathing for himself again after two days, a result labelled ""remarkable"" by the scientists. 

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the US approved the use of CT therapy as an experimental treatment in clinical trials, and for critical patients without other options.

In the UK, it has been reported that the NHS may start giving the therapy to hospital patients in the near future."

“Lewis, the time has come. It is time to make the Coronavirus in this Coronavirus factory. I am Reanu Keeves, Keanu Reeves’s evil brother.”

So I says to him

“Ok Reanu Keeves’s Keanu Reeves’s evil brother, I will do that because you asked me too. But will you give me money?

“no” said Reanu Keeves, Keanu Reeve’s evil brother.

“Ok” says Lewis (me)

So I do my work and go home. On the way back, Karl Marx and Max Stirner come up to me and they’re like 

“Hey there little boy, do u work at Big Chungus Coronavirus Factory”

So I say “Why yes, Karx Marx from communist manifesto and Max Stirner from popular anime “The Ego And It’s Own”, I, Lewis, the author, do in fact work at Big Chungus’s Coronavirus factory”

And the old men are like “tomorrow at work can you break into Big Chungus (meme of fat bugs bunny)‘s office, and steal the secret papers about the factory?”

And I’m like “no i cant do that stealing is wrong and i am get fired. But I will do it if you give me a money.”

“Ok” says old guys

So I go home, and see my hot girl freind who is totally real and has big boobs. 

“hey babe how was work?” She asks

“Shut the fuck up bitch” I say

We have super hot sex for the next three days, and then I go back to work at Big Chungus Coronavirus Factory.

“YOUR’RE LAIT!” Screams Keanu Reeves evil brother

“Fuck u” I say, and then I pull out a glock 19 and blow his fucking head off. I put is body in the Coronavirus machine. Then I sneek up to fat bugs bunny meme’s office, and break in. It’s really dark so I turn on light, and take the secret papers. Suddenly, the wooden thing that u open to get into room (i forget name) opens up, and in walks Big Chungus. He say

“WAT ARE U DO HERE??!! IM CALL THE POLICE

“No sir please don’t I’m so sorry I’m begging you please.” I say

He says “2 BaD!” and calls the police. The police show up and they say 

“WE ARE PLOLICE!! U UNDER AREWST!!!”

But then they see a black man walking a dog and go to shoot him. While they distracted, I run away, but then I get attacked by a DRACULA!! He’s like

“Aaahhh I’m a Dracula I drink blood aaaahhhh”

“No sir please don’t I’m so sorry I’m begging you please.” I say

“No” it says

Then I pull out an onion, and throw it at him.

“Aaahhh I’m allergic to onions!!! Ahhhh” then the Dracula turns back into a frog. 

Suddenly, big Chungus appears behind me and he’s like “I got you know” and the police come back and point their guns at me. I cry.

“Hand over the pappers.” Big Chungus (fat bugs bunny) says to me.

“no” I say, and then I pull out a can of black paint, and throw it on fat rabbit.

“Ahhh now i am covered in black paint that really sucks.” He says

Then the police say “everyone look! It’s another black persons!” And they shoot Big Chungus. I run away, and give the papers to Max Stirner and Karl Marx

They say “thank you so much loois, thanks to you, we can expose Big Chungus and cure the Cornucopiavirus. U r a her0.”

“ok” I say.

I think it’s wrong to “cancel” someone for their political party. Some people identify as republicans, some people identify as democrats; both are fine. People are entitled to their own beliefs. That just boils down to different values which is to be expected.

For me, it becomes an issue when those beliefs could potentially affect/harm the livelihood of others. If someone from BN shows any variety of support for a political figure who promotes harmful ideologies, they should be able to be called out for it. Should they be bullied? Definitely not. But there’s nothing wrong with educating someone, especially when a crisis this big is happening.

This isn’t really a matter of a difference in beliefs; it’s speaking out against people whose beliefs harm the livelihood and well-being of others. 

Recently, it has come out that many states are being denied medical resources from the federal government, and people are dying because of it. If someone wants to call out or educate HA after she quoted the tweet of someone who has had a hand in denying those people access to the medical resources they need to survive, they should be able to.

In the early stages of the pandemic we saw the exact same behaviour from politicians that we see in climate change. Slow to act, denial, disbelief, refusal to act, playing it down. This has happened with climate change but over decades. 

I think the key difference is time frame and ease of seeing consequences. Coronavirus is an imminent, present threat, that has easily identifiable and immediately visible consequences. Climate change is imminent too, but its a little harder to see the consequences for some people. We understand viruses more inherently than we understand climate science. And unfortunately, most political leaders are as average as the rest of us. 

Ultimately - I hope this pandemic does shake our leaders into a more sensible frame of mind. Its as if, in the west particularly, we've become completely complacent and willingly ignorant of the threats that face us. We are so comfortable that we believe our own bullshit ""oh, that won't happen to *us*"". This is exactly what happened at the start of the pandemic, its uncanny if you go through a lot of leaders newsclips week by week, many of the shittier ones follow the same pattern.

https://www.bostonglobe.com/2020/04/09/business/fauci-says-us-coronavirus-deaths-could-be-60000-half-earlier-projections-because-social-distancing/

>US fatalities from Covid-19 may be as low as 60,000 -- far fewer than earlier projections -- because of safety measures such as social distancing, the nation’s top infectious disease expert said Thursday.

>“The real data are telling us it is highly likely we are having a definite positive effect by the mitigation things that we’re doing, this physical separation,” Anthony Fauci, director of the US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, told NBC in an interview.

>“I believe we are going to see a downturn in that, and it looks more like the 60,000, than the 100,000 to 200,000” projected fatalities, he said. “But having said that we better be careful that we don’t say, ‘OK, we’re doing so well we could pull back.’”

I sometimes get depressed at the huge facilities they are building to house 1000 people with COVID, and then I remember that they haven't been filled yet, and how wonderful it would be if they were only every filled with a fraction of those people."

Some people on this sub told me that it was probably a prank but I have to wonder...I've never had something like that happen to me before. Right after that happened, I went to get baklava and the person at the counter asked me China? Japan? You have a virus?

&#x200B;

I went to Istanbul after Serbia (it was my 3rd time and this was in the first week of February) and the vibes were different from before. Some people coughed when I would get on public transportation and glared at me. One time I asked a lady for directions and the woman next to her looked me up and down and muttered ""China."" A woman kept glaring at me in an elevator and wouldn't stop so I finally told her I wasn't Chinese (because it was getting annoying). And several times, on that trip, I noticed people asking me about my ethnic background and being almost relieved/friendlier once they knew I was ethnically Korean.

&#x200B;

Then I came back home to NY and shit, the vibes were weird too. I have always felt comfortable in NY. Sure, you have some crazy people here and there (like a man who once randomly told me he hated Koreans when he saw me) but I felt safe usually taking the subway. I started noticing the energy changing...people looking at me funny on the subway, covering their mouth, walking away from me, not sitting next to me, fake coughing in a really mean way, and just looking at me sometimes like I was disgusting. I heard a lady say ""omg what if she has corona"" when I passed by her. Certain areas were much worse than others. I didn't feel safe visiting my friend in the Bronx. She had to walk me to the subway and once she left and I was waiting on the platform, a man spat in my direction. Next thing I know, the weeks after, I kept hearing of cases of people being punched in the head, having acid thrown on them, etc...sadly, a lot of this has been from other POC.

&#x200B;

I've had mixed experiences also in CVS and Costco...nothing too bad but just people running away from me again and also cashiers sometimes not being so friendly or nice (in a way that's obvious). Now people are scared of everyone and distancing from people regardless of whether they are Asian or not, but in the first few months, the stark contrast was really upsetting.

&#x200B;

I've traveled to almost every European country and in all honesty, I'm concerned with traveling to certain places like Italy and Spain. I found those regions pretty racist even before corona.

&#x200B;

There's a wikipedia article that lists a lot of cases of the xenophobia happening due to coronavirus. I'm having a hard time linking it but it's easy to find.

&#x200B;

PS: to the random people who hijack this thread and start saying that Asian countries are the most racist. a) this doesn't change the fact that people who are visibly Asian are getting attacked. This doesn't justify us getting attacked, spat at, or knifed. b) much of the racism in Asia is between neighboring countries. this kind of racism exists in a lot of Old World nations. You rarely hear cases of say Koreans beating up, spitting on, or stabbing random white people. c)  It amazes me how you try to justify Asian-Americans getting physically attacked (many of whom have NO ties to Asia) because ""Asian countries are SO racist."" This just shows me that you truly don't view us as American and you still view us as foreigners. Just saying. Also, imagine if I said this kind of shit about some other group. What if I said in response to attacks on Jewish people that are happening in NYC these days, ""omg Israelis ARE so racist and terrible to Palestine."" Like, for real, does this justify Jewish-Americans getting punched in the face? NO. So seriously, stop gaslighting Asian-Americans when they are talking about their experiences."

Something similar happened in Italy. In the south there's a significant percentage of people who work off the books. As a result they didn't qualify for unemployment aids. As people started to run out of food, crime increased. The most famous case was a local supermarket being raided by desperate people organising through whatsapp. A week ago the government said they would expend help to people working off the books.

When the clapping happens at 8, she's on her way home from the hospital and it's been a massive boost for her. She was a bit overwhelmed and emotional the first week it happened too.

>Is what we are doing now really the best approach? How can we respond to COVID-19 in a way that keeps our economy intact, keeps people employed, and empowers our people with a feeling of hope and optimism, not desperation and despair?

I mean, he does have a point. A post below me is linking scary articles about how California doesn't plan on lifting shelter-in place any time soon.

It's really like absolutely no consideration is being taken for anything outside of this virus whatsoever. We are so focused on trying to eradicate something that cannot be eradicated, so much that when we stop, we will realize all of the damage we have caused in the process and not know what to do. It is really getting to the point where are we really helping people? Sure we may be decreasing the possible number of deaths. At the cost of millions of jobs, at the cost of lives people have built up, at the cost of education, at the cost of businesses and dreams, at the cost of more lives because mental health really is an issue right now that needs to be taken more seriously. I mean, are we really helping ourselves in the long-run? If we keep this up for months more out of fear. Are we helping or hurting outselves?

Shelter-in place has to be lifted at some point. You cannot keep it in place forever because ""cases will rise when it is lifted"" it simply is not sustainable. What you're saying is all we're doing right now is delaying deaths. What does that help with if you look at it that way? I thought it was about keeping medical facilities from being too overwhelmed. Not about preventing every death which is not possible. Like c'mon. We have gone too far."

However, seeing around the 11th corner is to realize that school staff too will rightly, severely drag their feet when asked to return to petri dishes with extra agar, closed rooms during a pandemic where the root virus is new, asymptomatic for many, as-yet absent any significant therapeutic, and certainly absent a vaccine. 

Seeing around the 12th corner will be to consider the psychiatric pandemics that will follow the coronavirus crisis for all humans, regardless of location: PTSD, anxiety disorders, agoraphobia, enochlophobia (fear of crowds), insomnia, survivor's guilt, etc.

A nonzero amount of teachers, coaches and school staff will die between now and the fall. A nonzero amount of students' parents also will. The idea that even a plurality will be ready to walk into closed rooms with tens of others in August is clearly not a complete vision quite yet. Affix a few extra mirrors, and you can see, we are in this for the long haul with education, particularly for middle and high schools in the United States. With kids at those levels regularly viewed as ""mature enough"" to monitor themselves at home or in a room alone, expect all stakeholders--parents, students, teachers, counselors, administrators, coaches--to aim for remote secondary education.

Anyway, the people who criticized Bindel also made fun of her haircut and called her a Karen and racist and ignored all she has done to liberate all women, including women of color, from sexual slavery.

“Super-spreading events have played a significant role in transmission of other recently emerged coronaviruses,” the report said.

The ratings at this point don't matter and are [heavily skewed to news programming and network tv because of the pandemic](https://qz.com/1824422/coronavirus-has-stopped-the-decline-of-broadcast-tv-ratings/). When you control for the pandemic (re: go back to 4 weeks ago and before), AEW's numbers are perfectly steady and exceeding the sub-500k expectations TNT had. 

But let's ignore that people are afraid and anxious about dying from Coronavirus. AEW is using less than half its roster because it's an international cast and many are stuck in their home countries. These are empty arena shows when a big part of AEW is how into the product the fans and audiences are; that's a major character that is left out. There are so many extenuating circumstances that I don't know how you could make that comment with a straight face.

I know this will either get buried, ignored, fall on deaf ears or downvoted, but you should really focus on making sound arguments rather than false equivalences or an opportunity to dunk on someone.

Did the virus respect state borders?

2020-04-09,unpopularperiwinkle,italy,12,https://www.reddit.com/r/italy/comments/fxkkx3/live_megathread_coronavirus_090420/fmv9zno/,"https://erc.europa.eu/news/resignation-mauro-ferrari-–-statement-scientific-council

`The ERC's Scientific Council notes with regret the statement made by Mauro Ferrari concerning his resignation on 7 April. We here present the facts of the situation.

On Friday 27 March, all 19 active members of the ERC’s Scientific Council individually and unanimously requested that Mauro Ferrari resign from his position as ERC’s President.

This request was made for four reasons:

During his three-month term in office, Professor Ferrari displayed a complete lack of appreciation for the raison-d’être of the ERC to support excellent frontier science, designed and implemented by the best researchers in Europe. Although voicing his support for this in public pronouncements, the proposals he made to the Scientific Council did not reflect this position. He did not understand the context of the ERC within the EU’s Research and Innovation Programme Horizon 2020.

Since his appointment, Professor Ferrari displayed a lack of engagement with the ERC, failing to participate in many important meetings, spending extensive time in the USA and failing to defend the ERC’s programme and mission when representing the ERC.

In contrast, Professor Ferrari made several personal initiatives within the Commission, without consulting or tapping into the collective knowledge of the Scientific Council, and instead using his position to promote his own ideas.

Lastly, Professor Ferrari was involved in multiple external enterprises, some academic and some commercial, which took a lot of his time and effort and appeared on several occasions to take precedence over his commitment to ERC. The workload associated with these activities proved to be incompatible with the mandate of President of the Scientific Council.

Professor Ferrari subsequently resigned on 7 April 2020. Therefore, his resignation in fact followed a written unanimous vote of no confidence. In contrast, Professor Ferrari has stated that the reason for his resignation is that the Scientific Council did not support his call for the ERC to fund a special initiative focused on the COVID-19 virus. To address this point specifically, we did not support a special initiative because that is not our remit and the Commission's Research and Innovation Directorate General, with which we are connected, was already very active in developing new programmes to support this research through the appropriate channels.

Indeed, many ERC funded researchers have been active for some time in researching the coronavirus family and many other equally dangerous pathogens. Over 50 ongoing or completed ERC projects supported for a total value of about EUR 100 million are contributing to the response to the COVID-19 pandemic by providing insights from several different scientific fields such as: virology, epidemiology, immunology, paths for new diagnostics and treatments, public health, medical devices, artificial intelligence, social behaviour, crisis management.

In addition, as stated on its website in reaction to the COVID-19 crisis, the ERC offers ‘grantees the flexibility to adjust their research project”. This is an efficient measure because several ERC grantees already enquired about the possibility of addressing COVID-19 related research in their ongoing ERC project. All this information is publicly available on the ERC website, which also includes testimonies from funded ERC grantees on how bottom-up frontier research is critical to deliver new – and sometimes unexpected – insights relevant for better understanding and fighting the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as for providing social behaviour and crisis management related solutions.

However, the ERC does not make calls for specific topics, since a guiding principle of ERC is that our researchers are free to pursue the goals they define and to decide on what they wish to work. In our view, this is a crucial way to generate the best science.

The Scientific Council wishes to clarify, in case of any doubt, that they absolutely endorse the view that scientific research will provide the best solutions to tackling pandemics, such as COVID-19.

Therefore, we regret Professor Ferrari's statement, which at best is economical with the truth. This Scientific Council remains dedicated to pursuing the mission for which the ERC was established: the support of bottom-up ground-breaking research. It is also worth noting that despite the pandemic, the ERC Executive Agency is struggling against the odds to actively process applications for our Consolidator Grants and Starting Grants, which will support researchers throughout Europe to make the discoveries of the future.

The country quickly identifies the pathogen, closes its borders, launches an unprecedented campaign to eradicate the virus, and manages to ensure that very few cases leave the country. The other countries that do report cases – such as South Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong and Singapore – rapidly identify those who are infected, trace the people they have contacted, isolate the carriers of the virus and contain its spread. Through this three-pronged strategy – test, trace, isolate – eradication is successful. Humanity is saved.

> In reality, Sars-CoV-2, the novel coronavirus, escaped the public health interventions of the Chinese government and spread across the world. As other governments fumbled in their early responses, the virus silently rippled through communities, infecting many people and hospitalising and killing some. The virus is remarkably dangerous – it spreads as easily as a cold or flu, even via individuals who don’t have any visible symptoms, and the latest data shows that roughly 5% of people who become infected will require hospitalisation. Among them, 30% will be admitted to ICU. An estimated 0.6-1.4% of those who contract the virus will die.

> The world now has more than 1 million confirmed cases of coronavirus. The United States, which has more than 400,000 cases and approaching 13,000 deaths, has overtaken China, where there have been roughly 82,000 cases and 3,000 deaths. Half of all confirmed cases are now in Europe. Low- and middle-income countries are just a few weeks behind. While nations such as Senegal, Liberia and Nigeria have shown themselves aggressively ready to meet this challenge, their governments are constrained by a lack of resources, healthcare and testing capacity. Others, such as Brazil, India and Mexico, seem in denial of what is to come.

> We still don’t know what percentage of the world’s population has already been exposed to the virus. Without a reliable antibody test that can identify whether someone has had the virus and are likely to be immune, it’s unclear how many people are carrying the virus but not showing symptoms. The role of children in transmission is also unclear; children are neither immune nor seem to be heavily affected.

> So, what now? Based on what I’ve learned from published modelling and other countries’ responses to the virus, there are four possible scenarios for how this might end. One is that governments come together to agree a plan of eradication dependent on a rapid and cheap point-of-care diagnostic. All countries would simultaneously close their borders for an agreed amount of time and mount an aggressive campaign to identify carriers of the virus and prevent transmission.

> This approach seems unlikely; the virus has spread aggressively, and some countries have been reticent to cooperate with one another. But it could become more realistic for three reasons: antiviral therapies used to prevent or treat symptoms of Covid-19 may be poor; a vaccine may take decades to produce; and immunity may only be short-term, resulting in multiple waves of infection, even within the same individuals. New Zealand is currently attempting a version of this approach; the country has closed its borders, enforced a lockdown and is rolling out community testing to eradicate the virus.

> A second scenario, which seems moderately more likely, is that early vaccine trials are promising. While waiting for the vaccine, countries would try to delay the spread of the virus over the next 12-18 months through intermittent lockdowns. Health authorities would need to anticipate, three weeks in advance, whether there are enough beds, ventilators and staffing to treat those infected. On this basis, governments could decide whether to relax or increase quarantine measures.

> But this scenario is far from ideal. Healthcare systems would still be strained, and the economic and social costs of lockdown are high. Repeated lockdowns could lead to mass unemployment, an increase in child poverty and widespread social unrest. In poorer countries, more people could die from the lockdown than from the virus itself: of malnutrition, vaccine-preventable diseases or dehydration from limited access to clean water.

> A third and even likelier scenario is that countries follow South Korea’s example while they wait for a vaccine: increase testing to identify all carriers of the virus, trace the people they have contacted, and quarantine them for up to three weeks. This would involve large-scale planning, the swift development of a contact-tracing app, and thousands of volunteers to help with swabbing, processing results and monitoring quarantine. More relaxed physical distancing measures could be enforced to prevent the spread of the virus and ease the pressure on healthcare systems.

> In the absence of a viable vaccine for the foreseeable future, a final scenario could involve managing Covid-19 by treating its symptoms rather than its cause. Health workers could administer antiviral therapies that prevent patients from deteriorating to the point where they needed intensive care, or preventing them from dying when they reach a critical phase. An even better solution would be using prophylactic therapy to prevent the onset of Covid-19, in combination with rapid diagnostic testing to identify those who have been infected. In countries with the resources, this could be sustainable – but for poorer countries this approach would be difficult, if not impossible.

> There is no easy solution. The months ahead will involve a fragile balancing act between the interests of public health, society and the economy, with governments more reliant on each other than ever before. While half the battle will be in developing the tools to treat the virus – a vaccine, antiviral therapies and rapid diagnostic testing – the other half will be manufacturing enough doses, distributing these in a fair and equitable manner, and ensuring they reach individuals across the world.

I think the new part is that China is now going to isolate ""close contacts"" of those who don't test positive. 

Previously, China had been isolating anyone who tested positive, symptomatic or not, along with inbound travelers.  This is a multi-fold increase in isolation quarantine, because they're going to isolate the *entire* family/household if just ONE person tests positive, regardless of symptoms.  That is, they are operating under the assumption that the rest of the family/household are infected, but not detectable, and still infectious.

> 
> As of Wednesday, those communities, with a combined population of about 600,000, had recorded more than 7,260 coronavirus cases, according to data collected by the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene. Manhattan, with nearly three times more people, had about 10,860 cases.
> 
> Health officials have not released data on the race or ethnicity of the people who are sick, and officials from the Department of City Planning cautioned against drawing broad conclusions based on ZIP codes, which is how the city has released limited information about positive cases.
> 
> Yet health care workers and community leaders say it is indisputable that the pandemic has disproportionately affected the Hispanic day laborers, restaurant workers and cleaners who make up the largest share of the population in an area often celebrated as one of the most diverse places on earth. Latinos comprise 34 percent of the deaths in New York City, the largest share for any racial or ethnic group, according to data released by state officials on Wednesday.
> 
> The neighborhoods also have large communities of Indian, Bangladeshi, Chinese, Filipino and Nepali people, and a score of other ethnicities that have been devastated by the pandemic.
> 
> The city-run Elmhurst Hospital Center was one of the earliest and hardest-hit by the virus. Dozens of Covid-19 patients have clogged hallways as they wait for beds, terrified, alone and often unable to communicate in English.
> 
> “We’re the epicenter of the epicenter,” said Councilman Daniel Dromm, who represents Elmhurst and Jackson Heights. He became emotional as he took stock of losses that included five friends and more than two dozen constituents. “This has shaken the whole neighborhood,” he said.
> 
> In their daily toll of the fallen, city and state health officials have not disclosed where exactly deaths are occurring. But community leaders and organizers have kept their own tallies, providing a window into the virus’ disproportionate impact on immigrant communities. Some of the more prominent names in Queens include the Rev. Antonio Checo, a pastor at St. Mark’s Episcopal Church in Jackson Heights; Lorena Borjas, a transgender activist; and Kamal Ahmed, the president of the Bangladesh Society.
> 
> The New York Taxi Workers Alliance said 28 drivers had died — the vast majority of them immigrants living in Queens — and Make the Road New York, an advocacy organization that serves the area’s working-class Latinos, said eight of its members in Queens had died. “A tragedy is unfolding,” said the co-director, Javier H. Valdés.
> 
> The crisis has transformed the neighborhood. Roosevelt Avenue, the vital commercial artery that normally bustles with taquerias, arepa stands, threading salons and shops selling newspapers in dozens of languages, has all but shut down. The eerie silence is intermittently broken by sirens and the clattering of trains on elevated tracks.
> 
> A handful of street vendors have returned, but now they sell masks and dress in Tyvek suits. With churches and mosques closed, families of the dead can mourn only at home.
>
> 
> The chockablock density that defines this part of Queens may have also have been its undoing. Doctors and community leaders say poverty, notoriously overcrowded homes and government inaction left residents especially vulnerable to the virus.
> 
> “I don’t think the city communicated the level of danger,” said Claudia Zamora, the interim deputy director of New Immigrant Community Empowerment, an advocacy group and worker center in Jackson Heights.
> 
> In early March, she said, city health officials sent out fliers with hand-washing tips, but not the outreach workers and multilingual posters that might have conveyed the looming peril.
> 
> The sick now include laborers like Ángel, 39, a construction worker from Ecuador who asked that only his first name be used because of his immigration status.
> 
> Like many, he said he worked at a Manhattan construction site until he fell ill. He said he was turned away from Elmhurst Hospital because his symptoms were not deemed life-threatening and had been suffering in the apartment in Corona he shares with three other workers. “I don’t have anyone to help me,” he said.
>
> &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t have anyone to help me,&rdquo; said &Aacute;ngel, a 39-year-old construction worker from Ecuador.
> “I don’t have anyone to help me,” said Ángel, a 39-year-old construction worker from Ecuador.
> 
> City officials rejected the suggestion that they left the city’s immigrant neighborhoods to fend for themselves. The Department of Health, officials said, created coronavirus fact sheets in 15 languages. Officials mounted multilingual public service campaigns in subways and on television, and have provided continuous updates to the ethnic media including on the need for social distancing.
> 
> Ronny Barzola, a 28-year-old Ecuadorean-American from nearby Kew Gardens who works for the food delivery service Caviar, is one of the lucky few to still have a job. He slathers his hands with sanitizer throughout the day but worries about his mother and sister, both of whom are sick at home but have been unable to get tested. “It’s impossible to isolate when everyone is sharing the same apartment,” he said.
> 
> Mr. Subba, a longtime driver for services including Uber and Via, had stopped driving last month after picking up a sick passenger, said a cousin, Munindra Nembang, who added that Mr. Subba, 49, had been diabetic. His wife and two of his children were also infected.

Turns into: ""There are cases in Brazil, therefore Covid-19 has no seasonality!"".

Its important to note that virtually every coronavirus has a degree of seasonality to it (yes, even MERS). Most of the empirical evidence we've seen points to warmer weather and/or humidity retarding the spread of the virus. The question is to what degree. If the virus has a normal R0 of 3 with no mitigation and in cold weather and summer turns that into an R0 of 1.5, that is very helpful, because then even mild mitigation can dramatically slow the spread during the summer."

FAQ

Q: Why is your data different than OP's?

A: I pull my data from the [Ohio Coronavirus website](https://coronavirus.ohio.gov/wps/portal/gov/covid-19/home/dashboard) via a spreadsheet they update daily. That gives different numbers than what OP posts. 

From my understanding, rather than just saying ""we have 400 new cases today"" they backdate some of the cases to the day they likely actually contracted the virus. So the total remains the same, but the daily amount changes. For example, on 4/7 the number of cases on 4/6 was 56. On 4/8 the number of cases on 4/6 went up to 137."

The article has some other outlandish takes. 

Yet, the graphs and raw data point to the peaks in the US hitting this weekend with individual states spread out over the last 2 weeks of April. And 0 daily deaths by June (https://covid19.healthdata.org/united-states-of-america/california). 

MLB is attempting at coming back in May. A hefty task yes, and one I dont think will happen until June at the earliest, but a plan nonetheless. 

If the data shows the trends getting better and what we're doing is evidently working, one could presume that by June things can be relaxed and life could return to semi normal with some obvious restrictions and procedures in place (basic daily social distancing, crowd limit at shops/theaters/parks, no huge events until the fall (festivals, sports, amusement parks), etc. 

People and many officials are already pushing back on total lockdown, and many European countries are re opening very soon and theyve all pretty much gotten past their peaks and now are working on maintaining their pace and getting on their feet to tackle any stragglers and a potential second wave later this year. Asian countries are well past us it seems at this point and are also prepping for the waves to follow

A second wave is definitely a big worry, and should be treated as such. But to think we wont have things until late November, if we're lucky, is just beyond preposterous and reeks of not knowing how humans work to me. Not to mention, I highly doubt the sports leagues of the world will hold out much longer as they're actively losing *billions* in revenue, and people like their money. On top of that, not having sports for another 8+ months keeps thousands of people across all sports jobless and at the mercy of their penny pincher billionaire bosses. 

I can see having no crowds in the arenas and stadiums, but sports are a billion dollar industry, and I dont think theyll keep losing money out of their pockets lightly. 

This whole article just reeks of clickbait shit to me, a business man making some bold prediction so his name can trend on Twitter and media and he can go ahead and say something like ""thank God we managed to stop this virus, you the people are awesome! Our original projections and predictions weren't met because you all did your part. Now, let's get to the voting polls and vote for us!""

2020-04-09,FlyingFox86,DebunkThis,10,https://www.reddit.com/r/DebunkThis/comments/fxwzcj/hospitals_receive_13000_for_each_diagnosed/fmxfcfs/,"As promised in another reply, I've taken a closer look.

1. The 12% figure in Italy. This does not mean that 88% didn't die of Corona. It means that only 12% is confirmed to have directly died from Corona and nothing else. These 88% often have underlying conditions, but we already knew that people in their situation would be more vulnerable. Should they not be counted because of that? Do only the strong count?
2. *In cases where a definite diagnosis of COVID–19 cannot be made, but it is suspected or likely (e.g., the circumstances are compelling within a reasonable degree of certainty), it is acceptable to report COVID–19 on a death certificate as “probable” or “presumed.”*  
https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nvss/vsrg/vsrg03-508.pdf?ref=patrick.net  
The way she focuses on ""probable"" and ""presumed"" and quickly rattles of the part between the brackets, makes it sound as if you can guess a death is from Covid-19 and write it up like that.  
But the truth, if you actually read it, seems quite the opposite. It specifically states you need to have a reasonable degree of certainty, and even then you must make note that it's presumed or probable.
3. The politician being interviewed here claims that this is ridiculous, that the CDC manual for writing death certificates requires precision and specificity. But as per the previous point, this Covid-19 guideline doesn't deviate from that.  
Furthermore, here's an instruction from the CDC 2004:  
*The cause-of-death information should be YOUR best medical OPINION. A condition can be listed as “probable” even if it has not been definitively diagnosed.*  
https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/dvs/blue\_form.pdf  
Perfectly in line again with the Covid-19 guidelines. Everything that follows from this family doctor is therefore based on a lie.
4. *[The people's] thrust in politicians is already wearing thin.*  
Said the politician
5. Doctor makes a very clear with an example that cause of death is not a judgement call. He pretends doctors are being asked to do something different from normal. Clearly not the case, refer to point 3.
6. I can't find the claim about the 13,000 $ from medicare for a hospital for each Covid-19 patient. But given how expensive intensive medical care like this can get, this does not seem all that outlandish at all. What is it with Americans and their medicare?  
But the more important point is that he is trying to link this to the previous stuff about death certificates, that money is a strong motivator to fudge the numbers. But this 13,000$ is for the treatment of living patients, so this is irrelevant.
7. Host argues that as there is socialized medicine in Italy, they don't care about the money. I don't think she has any clue how socialized medicine works. The hospitals still have their costs, they still get their money from the healthcare system.
8. She then makes a claim about Italy reclassifying deaths according to their top scientific adviser. Yet there is no evidence of that, unless she is talking about the stuff she mentioned in the beginning:  
https://www.telegraph.co.uk/global-health/science-and-disease/have-many-coronavirus-patients-died-italy/  
If so, she has deeply misunderstood this article. Nowhere does it state that anything has been fudged after the fact.

That's about it for the factual debunking. I just want to say as a closing remark how unprofessional this is from both Fox News and this doctor. To present yourself like this, as if you are an expert, while peddling some politically motivated conspiracy theory, during a time like this, is disgusting. Some people have no decency.

LÅter ganska i linje med hur folkhälsomyndigheten har resonerat faktiskt.   


"" One way to make progress is to consider that a lockdown, if it goes on  long enough, will bring about a smaller economy that can afford fewer  doctors, nurses, and medicines. In the United Kingdom, the National  Health Service [estimates](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18767894)  that for about £25,000 ($30,000) it can pay for one more  “quality-adjusted life year.” In effect, that sum can buy a patient an  extra year of healthy life.If we then estimate how much lockdowns cost  the economy, we can estimate the years of healthy life we are likely to  gain now by containing the virus and compare it to how many years we are  likely to lose later from a smaller economy.We have not yet seen any sufficiently rigorous attempts to do this. Paul Frijters, an economist, has offered a[ back-of-the-envelope analysis](http://clubtroppo.com.au/2020/03/21/the-corona-dilemma/) that  leads to a startling result: it would have been better, in terms of  years of healthy life lost, not to have started the lockdowns.  "" (...)    


""in any case, thinking solely in terms of quality-adjusted life years is  too narrow. Health isn’t all that matters. What we really need to do is  compare the impact different policies have on our overall wellbeing.To  do that, we think it’s best to measure wellbeing by using individuals’  reports of how happy and how satisfied with their lives they are, an  approach pioneered by academics in the[ World Happiness Report](https://worldhappiness.report/).  Doing this means we can, in a principled way, weigh up otherwise  hard-to-compare considerations when deciding how to respond to COVID-19 –  or to any other systemic risk.To focus on one major concern, [ten million US jobs](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/02/world/coronavirus-news.html?action=click&module=Spotlight&pgtype=Homepage#link-1d2683c5) have been lost in just two weeks, almost entirely due to the pandemic.

We all agree that  unemployment is bad, but it’s not obvious how we should trade  unemployment against years of healthy life. Thinking directly in terms of wellbeing allows us to make this comparison. Unemployment has dire effects on wellbeing, [reducing individuals’ life satisfaction by 20%](https://theconversation.com/coronavirus-lays-bare-the-trauma-of-losing-your-job-134450).  With this information, we can compare the human costs of a lockdown to  the wellbeing gained by extending lives. A broader analysis would  include other impacts, such as social isolation and anxiety, and tell us  when a lockdown should be lifted.COVID-19 will be with us for some  time. Are months of government-enforced lockdowns the right policy? We  don’t know, and as moral philosophers, we can’t answer this question on  our own. Empirical researchers need to take on the challenge of  calculating the effects, not in terms of wealth or health, but in the  ultimate currency, wellbeing. ""

Maybe people don't want to arm up because they are panicked crazy people, but because they want some means of self defense when a significant portion of a city's police officers are down for the count with coronavirus and departments are openly announcing that whole categories of crimes will receive no officer response at all.  

Of course, in the eyes of this author (and those of many anti-gun people), a gun is a highly dangerous weapon that dispenses death without discrimination to anyone/everyone around it, and thus no truly sane person would want a gun anywhere near them.  The fact that people are buying guns must be motivated by panic, for the same reasons that people hoard toilet paper, people are buying dangerous weapons of destruction that (were they not panicked to the point of losing their grip on reality) they'd want nothing to do with.  And now the upcoming SCOTUS case will 'pour gasoline on the fire' giving more panicked insane people deadly weapons.  How terrible!

Says right there, N95 **or higher.** If truly nothing is available, then use a facemask.

So what does ""or higher"" mean?

Well, on the page entitled, [Strategies to Optimize the Supply of PPE and Equipment](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/ppe-strategy/index.html) you will find this:

These may be purchased straight from Amazon or 3M by any hospital right now.  They cost about $30 each, may be cleaned easily with soap and water or bleach wipes, and may be used indefinitely.  Cartridges are rated to last 6 months, and are inexpensive to replace.

So for less than the cost of a single day's worth of N95s (mind you, they now cost $7-10 EACH on the bulk market right now), they could give you a respirator that you could use **for a year.**  Speaking as someone who has worn these on a daily basis, they are quite a bit more comfortable than N95s, they fit much better, they are easy to leak-check, they don't leak, and besides they offer significantly better protection against viral aerosols.

In 1995, a TB clinic in Texas switched from masks to elastomeric respirators and PAPRs for those who couldn't wear elastomerics.  Prior to that, 40-50 percent of staff were PPD+ and 1-2 percent were positive for actual disease.  After 1994, [zero TST conversions](https://books.google.com/books?id=7-6UDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA106&lpg=PA106&dq=TCID+elastomeric+seroconversion+tuberculosis&source=bl&ots=MbKqGbootn&sig=ACfU3U15NrGzILAM146uPyQzjXiyIJDeaw&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjGuaalztzoAhVDnKwKHaKDBSgQ6AEwAHoECA0QKQ#v=onepage&q=TCID%20elastomeric%20seroconversion%20tuberculosis&f=false).  Isn't that what you want protecting your lungs?

There's a good amount of information on [required procedures, training, cleaning, etc](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK540080/) already available for these, too.  Nobody has to reinvent the wheel here.

**Your life is on the line because certain specific people will not order you a one-time purchase of a $30 respirator.**

>	So, this whole thing has been bothering me for a while now and this seems like the only place I won't get decried for saying this, including my own home.

>	This virus has turned the entire world into a dystopia. Not even a partial dystopia, a full, 100%, novel dystopia.

>	Through googling and prior knowledge, there are a couple things that have to happen to be a dystopia:

>	* Propaganda being used for control
* Information, thought, and freedom being restricted
* A figurehead or concept is worshiped
* Citizens perceived to be under constant surveillance
* Fear of outside world
* Living in dehumanized states
* Natural world being banished or distrusted
* Citizens conforming to uniform expectations, individuality and dissent are seen as bad
* And lastly, but most importantly, the society is an illusion of a perfect world

>	[Source for those points here](http://www.readwritethink.org/files/resources/lesson_images/lesson926/DefinitionCharacteristics.pdf)

>	For the propaganda (def: information, especially of a biased or misleading nature, used to promote or publicize a particular political cause or point of view), countless media outlets are reporting the number of confirmed cases and deaths live as they come in, however, this information is only the people who are tested. For a disease that has been known about since last year, and has been able to move unchecked throughout the world, as there were no shutdowns at that time. There is no statistically possible way that the numbers reported are close, to even 1/10th of the true number of infected at least, possibly even including deaths. I know that hospitals are being swarmed, but that is partially because of human stupidity, as not every case of COVID19 is a death sentence that needs a hospital bed. as of the time of writing this, there have been over 1.26 million confirmed cases, and 0.069 million confirmed deaths. That comes out to a death percentage of around 5%, which sounds horrible. However, this does not account for age, prior conditions, or anything else. [Given the information here](https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/coronavirus-age-sex-demographics/), for the actual death rate to reach the supposed total estimate, you'd have to be around 60+ years old, or have a pre-existing condition. Anyone under 60, with no pre-existing condition, your chances of death are actually 1%, based on all who have been tested, ignoring the billions who have not and have certainly been infected already.

>	For information, thought, and freedom being restricted, it's a bit more circumstantial depending on where you live. Most countries are going into lock down, which is causing multitudes of other problems for the people's well being (mental, economic, social, even physical health). If you are living in a locked down country, your freedom is being restricted. There are many examples, but [this is the first I found](https://futurism.com/neoscope/spanish-police-drones-yell-breaking-quarantine). Granted, you could always ignore them, but then they will start going to more drastic measures, such as armed lock downs, which [can be seen here](https://www.forbes.com/sites/alexandrasternlicht/2020/04/02/duterte-threatens-to-shoot-quarantine-violators-in-philippines/#171e28102b85).

>	A figurehead or concept being worshiped is easy to see when you look at subs like /r/coronavirus, as they constantly praise people social distancing, locking down entire states and countries, and even pushing for more drastic measures around the clock. People see these things as the gods that will save us from the virus, one that isn't actually as bad as the media hopes you think it is.

>	As mentioned above, citizens are close to becoming under constant surveillance, if they weren't already. As mentioned with the drones, and just people looking out their windows, if you're outside, there is most likely someone watching you, unless you live completely alone away from society.

>	The fear of the outside world is the most prominent I believe, as people are starting to believe that even stepping foot out your front door will give you COVID 19. Since this so closely leads into another aspect, I'll simply mention it here to save your time. The natural world has been banished and is so heavily distrusted, that people are becoming afraid to walk outside.

>	The next point is that people live in dehumanized states. This one should be obvious for anyone who even remotely is alive. People are social creatures. They are meant to have in person contact with others to keep their mental health up. In this state, people who rely on social interaction to stay happy are being forced to isolate themselves from their coping mechanisms, and as much as people praise this and say they were living like this already, none were harassed, or even threatened with death, to go out.

>	The second to last point, is that citizens conform to uniform expectations, and any individuality is shunned. This is quickly becoming true, as more and more people fall to the praise of social distancing, lock downs, turning away any visitors, and shunning people who actually socialize with others without a screen. I'll be the first to say I used to think that it was socializing to be talking over a computer or phone, but actually talking with people you like in person is a completely different experience. If you're to do the latter now, you'd be shunned, and probably harassed just for being human.

>	Finally, the most important characteristic, the idea that we're living in a perfect world. Does this mean that we're living in a world that there will be no deaths? No, it means people have been convinced into believing that all these excessive measures are actually helping us rather than hurting us. How deep do we have to go into a dystopia before we finally wake up and realize what's happened?

>	All in all, this **CANNOT** go on if we're to live as free people. Build more hospitals, actually prepare for the severe cases, and stop admitting every single case **INCASE** it gets bad. Will there be deaths? Yes. I will be the first to admit it, I'm living with 2 people who are at risk, and I'd rather not see them dead. But we can't be caged like animals just because there's a less than 1% chance of a normal person dying. I hate Trump for some of the stuff he's caused, trade wars and corruption and all, but I agree with him on one point. **THIS CANNOT GO ON**. For the people who say he's trying to make himself a dictator, he could take this chance to take complete control, declare martial law and never end it, but he hasn't. He's pushing for us to open back up by Easter."

To put it in perspective, the leading cause of death in the US in 2017 was heart disease with 647,457 deaths.

That was an average of 1,798.5 deaths per day.

So far today, at 5:32p, coronavirus has killed 1,666 people.  It will be over 1798 by the end of today.  Like it was tomorrow.  And the day before that.  And will be tomorrow.

Obviously - hopefully? - those numbers will not continue for a full year.  But what if they do?  Are we willing to sacrifice over 650k Americans?

I just think our economy should work for *us*.  The economy is to benefit humans, not the other way around (humans benefiting the economy).  If a shutdown like this - one that is necessary to save lives - is going to fuck it up so bad, maybe we need to take a real hard look at what we're doing.

Other headlines I'm looking forward too:

*""Do your bit to help Britain recover by taking out Private Healthcare Insurance! Stop putting un-necessary stress on the healthcare system if you are earning 30k or 40k, it's selfish and unpatriotic to use the NHS if you can afford to go private!""*

*""Help Britain pay for it's Coronavirus Bill by taking your kids out of state school and going private! Every penny you spend on private education is money that the government can use to help the nation recover!""*

*""National Service for Ungrateful Millenials, who put the nation at risk (especially the over 65's) by going out and partying during the virus. Make them pay back with forced labour the damage they've done!""*

EDIT: I recall Stanley Baldwin, who was a very clever political operation I think it was in the early 20's, possibly before he was PM and at either the Treasury or Board of Trade, saying to the TUC that ""Every worker in this country must accept reductions in wages in order to help put business back on its feet"" as the line when faced with widespread strike action. This line helped him appeal to patriotism in order to prevent a general strike taking place. By framing it this way it weakened the major unions resolve, helped portray their struggle as selfish and unpatriotic, and basically managed to delay the General Strike that was clearly building from the grassroots up for a few more years, giving the government time to build a strike-breaking operation, stockpile coal, train spies and saboteurs to infiltrate the trade union movement and so on. Has the General strike took place 3 or 4 years earlier, as it nearly did, there's a good chance it would've overthrown the government and the general council of the TUC would've ended up running the country. *Now there's an alternate timeline for you all history nerds to enjoy....*

He was very good at this Baldwin - prior to that when he was at the treasury he had run a scheme asking rich people to give up chunks of their wealth to the treasury as a way of showing that everyone was chipping in to fund the way, but it was crucially a **voluntary** donation, done as a way to deflect criticism for him not increasing taxes on business or the wealthy in the aftermath of the Great War. He managed to placate people on the left who were demanding wealth redistribution but doing it in a way based on *noblesse oblige* rather than any kind of socialism or social democracy.

Out of a mixture of decency, patriotism and concern for human welfare you can get people, even those who are poor, to give up huge amounts of what little they have if they feel it's a major crisis. It relies largely on having the media and the PR industry working on shaping a narrative in that way, but the BBC is always reliable in serving the government at times of potential unrest. If you can tug on their heartstrings and appeal to patrotism too, that helps, as well as public shaming of those who don't go along with it (so people will pay up just so they aren't singled out for not doing their bit) and the Tory party is absolutely top notch at playing these kinds of games.

Doesn't work quite so well with Google or Amazon et al sadly, who'll probably end up pressuring the government to pay less tax whilst making a few ""crumbs off the table"" charitable donations for the sake of good public relations."

They should have been stocking up on PPE and ventilators months ago, rather than leaving it until it was too late. If I, a regular civilian, thought to purchase a reusable respirator back then, why didn't the government? 

More generally speaking, the gov ran an operation called project cygnus in 2017, to simulate how well the NHS could cope with a severe flu pandemic. The results were that the NHS needed more PPE, more hospital beds, and more staff, or else catastrophic numbers would die. The tories chose to ignore these results and hide them from the public until recently. And now it has come back to bite them: they are struggling to get adequate PPE and nurses are literally wrapping bin bags around their bodies to try to protect themselves, they are having to rent hospital beds from the private sector to the tune of £2.5M per day, and they are begging elderly retired doctors to return to the service to bolster numbers.

The magnitude of death we are seeing, particularly among NHS staff, is a direct consequence of tory incompetence and malice."

Hello,

In light of the recent events regarding the global spread of coronavirus (alternately known as COVID-19), we are mandating a minimum distancing between comments. To that end we are requiring that all comments be a minimum of 5,000 characters to ensure that there is a safe distance between users at all times. Please help us by ensuring that your commentary meets this minimum requirement. Attempts to circumvent this will see users quarantined from the subreddit. 

###Tips For Social Distancing, Quarantine, And Isolation During An Infectious Disease Outbreak

**What Is Social Distancing?**

Social distancing is a way to keep people from interacting closely or frequently enough to spread an infectious disease. Schools and other gathering places such as movie theaters may close, and sports events and religious services may be cancelled.

**What Is Quarantine?**

Quarantine separates and restricts the movement of people who have been exposed to a contagious disease to see if they become sick. It lasts long enough to ensure the person has not contracted an infectious disease.

**What Is Isolation?**

Isolation prevents the spread of an infectious disease by separating people who are sick from those who are not. It lasts as long as the disease is contagious.

##What To Expect: Typical Reactions

Everyone reacts differently to stressful situations such as an infectious disease outbreak that requires social distancing, quarantine, or isolation. People may feel:

- **Anxiety, worry, or fear related to**:  
- Your own health status  
- The health status of others whom you may have exposed to the disease  
- The resentment that your friends and family may feel if they need to go into quarantine as a result of contact with you  
- The experience of monitoring yourself, or being monitored by others for signs and symptoms of the disease  
- Time taken off from work and the potential loss of income and job security  
- The challenges of securing things you need, such as groceries and personal care items  
- **Concern** about being able to effectively care for children or others in your care  
- **Uncertainty or frustration** about how long you will need to remain in this situation, and uncertainty about the future  
- **Loneliness** associated with feeling cut off from the world and from loved ones  
- **Anger** if you think you were exposed to the disease because of others’ negligence  
- **Boredom and frustration** because you may not be able to work or engage in regular day-to-day activities  
- **Uncertainty or ambivalence** about the situation  
- **A desire** to use alcohol or drugs to cope  
- **Symptoms of depression**, such as feelings of hopelessness, changes in appetite, or sleeping too little or too much  
- **Symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD)**, such as intrusive distressing memories, flashbacks (reliving the event), nightmares, changes in thoughts and mood, and being easily startled.

##Ways To Support Yourself During Social Distancing, Quarantine, and Isolation

#UNDERSTAND THE RISK

Consider the real risk of harm to yourself and others around you. The public perception of risk during a situation such as an infectious disease outbreak is often inaccurate. Media coverage may create the impression that people are in immediate danger when really the risk for infection may be very low. Take steps to get the facts:

- Stay up to date on what is happening, while limiting your media exposure. Avoid watching or listening to news reports 24/7 since this tends to increase anxiety and worry. Remember that children are especially affected by what they hear and see on television.  
- Look to credible sources for information on the infectious disease outbreak.

#BE YOUR OWN ADVOCATE

Speaking out about your needs is particularly important if you are in quarantine, since you may not be in a hospital or other facility where your basic needs are met. Ensure you have what you need to feel safe, secure, and comfortable.

- Work with local, state, or national health officials to find out how you can arrange for groceries and toiletries to be delivered to your home as needed.  
- Inform health care providers or health authorities of any needed medications and work with them to ensure that you continue to receive those medications.

#EDUCATE YOURSELF

Health care providers and health authorities should provide information on the disease, its diagnosis, and treatment.

- Do not be afraid to ask questions—clear communication with a health care provider may help reduce any distress associated with social distancing, quarantine, or isolation.  
- Ask for written information when available.  
- Ask a family member or friend to obtain information in the event that you are unable to secure this information on your own.

#WORK WITH YOUR EMPLOYER TO REDUCE FINANCIAL STRESS

If you’re unable to work during this time, you may experience stress related to your job status or financial situation.

- Provide your employer with a clear explanation of why you are away from work.  
- Contact the U.S. Department of Labor tollfree at 1-866-487-2365 about the Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA), which allows U.S. employees up to 12 weeks of unpaid leave for serious medical conditions, or to care for a family member with a serious medical condition.  
- Contact your utility providers, cable and Internet provider, and other companies from whom you get monthly bills to explain your situation and request alternative bill payment arrangements as needed.

#CONNECT WITH OTHERS

Reaching out to people you trust is one of the best ways to reduce anxiety, depression, loneliness, and boredom during social distancing, quarantine, and isolation. You can:

- Use the telephone, email, text messaging, and social media to connect with friends, family, and others.  
- Talk “face to face” with friends and loved ones using Skype or FaceTime.  
- If approved by health authorities and your health care providers, arrange for your friends and loved ones to bring you newspapers, movies, and books.  
- Sign up for emergency alerts via text or email to ensure you get updates as soon as they are available.  
- Call SAMHSA’s free 24-hour Disaster Distress Helpline at 1-800-985-5990, if you feel lonely or need support.  
- Use the Internet, radio, and television to keep up with local, national, and world events.  
- If you need to connect with someone because of an ongoing alcohol or drug problem, consider calling your local Alcoholics Anonymous or Narcotics Anonymous offices.

#TALK TO YOUR DOCTOR

If you are in a medical facility, you may have access to health care providers who can answer your questions. However, if you are quarantined at home, and you’re worried about physical symptoms you or your loved ones may be experiencing, call your doctor or other health care provider:

- Ask your provider whether it would be possible to schedule remote appointments via Skype or FaceTime for mental health, substance use, or physical health needs.

#USE PRACTICAL WAYS TO COPE AND RELAX

- Relax your body often by doing things that work for you-take deep breaths, stretch, meditate or pray, or engage in activities you enjoy.  
- Pace yourself between stressful activities, and do something fun after a hard task.  
- Talk about your experiences and feelings to loved ones and friends, if you find it helpful.  
- Maintain a sense of hope and positive thinking; consider keeping a journal where you write down things you are grateful for or that are going well"

Between the massive tornadoes last Memorial Day, the shooting that happened over the summer, the KKK rally, and then seeing the NCAA tournament cancelled when the Dayton Flyers (our pride and joy) actually had a chance to win the whole thing is just devastating (I know the last one is the least of our worries in the coronavirus outbreak, but it was an extra kick in the nuts). If there’s one thing all this tragedy has taught me it’s that Daytonians are a tough bunch who help each other in need. Time and time again, the people here have come together in the face of difficulty and tragedy. As much as this is a heartwarming story, at this point, I’d expect nothing less.

First, it’s important to understand how no-kill shelters work. They typically do not accept animals over a certain age or with any pre existing conditions. They only accept easily adoptable animals. So while no-kill shelters sound great (and I’m not saying they’re necessarily bad), they basically turn away a lot of animals. What’s supposed to happen to those animals they won’t accept?

PETA shelters will accept any animal. Some of these animals are not easily adoptable. PETA will try, but unfortunately, there are just too many unwanted animals for all of them to find a home. They even work with no-kill shelters to place easily adoptable animals with them. Millions of animals end up euthanized annually simply because there aren’t enough resources to care for them, and there aren’t enough homes willing or able to adopt. 

Look at the Coronavirus crisis- there are only so many beds in a hospital and so many ventilators. Our hospitals are at capacity, and in certain areas, doctors have to essentially triage to determine who gets care and who is left to die. That’s the same hard position these PETA shelters are put in- with limited resources, how are they supposed to care an over abundance of these animals? We don’t tell those doctors that they must hate their patients for making that tough call. 

I don’t like that any animals have to be euthanized at all, EVER. But people refuse to spay and neuter their pets, and plenty of people still continue to choose breeding over adopting. Like I’m 100% open to hearing about how we can handle this situation better, but to me, it just sounds like PETA is willing to do the hard/“dirty” work that other shelters won’t do. People look at PETA as this hardline organization so it MUST mean they’re hypocrites if they euthanize animals. But really, they’re doing what they can to adopt out as many animals as possible.

Again, I am not pro PETA. I just think there’s a lot of misinformation surrounding this particular issue. It’s ok if you still disagree with the choices PETA makes, but I do hope that criticism/hate comes along with an alternative to how we handle this situation."

What should have happened is as soon as our intelligence services discovered the virus in Wuhan we should have applied strong international pressure for them to quickly contain it or we completely shut out their travellers. We also use international observers / medical organisations to certify they've done this before normalising things. 

If we weren't able to do the above and the virus spread throughout the world we should have framed the narrative in a consistent way so everyone is clear about what happened: China is the source of this virus, it (and other viruses) started in humans and spread in China specifically because of policies the CCP are in control of. They lifted the ban on exotic, wet markets and the highest ranking officials of the CCP eat these animals for superstitions reasons not supported by medical science, i.e. they make your dick bigger. They also suppressed whistleblowers and disappeared medical staff who warned about this which is why it carried on spreading unabated for months - by this time well outside of China and Asia. 

If we stuck with this narrative and repeated it daily as the virus spread every single government and NGO would be looking for China to justify its behaviour here given the devastating impact of the virus. Countries would already be seriously considering what measures they introduce against China given they are the cause of the biggest crisis to hit their country. They'd be completely under the spotlight and we'd see their international credibility completely collapse. Coronavirus would permanently be associated with the Chinese government, it would be their Chernobyl.

Instead what happened is they knew something like this would happen in future so co-opted the WHO and turned them into their propaganda arm, somehow people think they responded well because ""Chinese people take lockdowns seriously"" and people are even upset that it's being called Chinese. It seems as though it's only people who follow politics closely that know China's figures are bullshit, everyone else seems to be going along with the ""officially reported"" numbers which put several countries ahead of China. This means in a few months everyone will assume China was a victim just like everyone else but they dealt with their crisis well - in fact better than several European countries and America who have far more dead (to be fair America hasn't dealt with it well but China has still been worse).

This virus is dangerous to more than just a ""portion of the population"" that can be ""isolated"".  Basically, almost 40% of the 18+ USA population has a higher risk of developing a serious illness with a COVID-19 infection.   [https://www.kff.org/global-health-policy/issue-brief/how-many-adults-are-at-risk-of-serious-illness-if-infected-with-coronavirus/](https://www.kff.org/global-health-policy/issue-brief/how-many-adults-are-at-risk-of-serious-illness-if-infected-with-coronavirus/)

Getting 40% to really socially isolate themselves is better than some states are probably seeing with stay at home orders.  Even if you could design a system identify, inform, and keep them home, that's 40% of the population that is not going to the restaurants, movies, vacations, stores, etc., etc., etc.  Guess what, your economy still is screwed up.

And since you brought up the flu, only 3-11% get the flu every year.   [https://www.cdc.gov/flu/about/keyfacts.htm](https://www.cdc.gov/flu/about/keyfacts.htm)   Herd immunity needs 70%.  That's a lot of people you are going to need to put in the hospital and potentially kill to reach herd immunity.

That's why the epidemiologists are warning us that there are no quick fixes.  It's going to require lots of testing, contact tracing, and city/region/state shut downs to manage the flare ups until we can get to a vaccine.

Finally, we're deluding ourselves if we think this is even a choice.  If, say, we open up and say, Atlanta has the morgue trucks backing into the hospitals and people dying on the hallway floor of the ER room, people are going to panic and self-isolate.  Then the virus will make our choice for us."

Remember those ratings upgrades that we've been seeing the news for the last 8 years? S&P. Fitch. Moody's? That's our credit rating. Our capacity to pay back what our country borrows. We can borrow money from the world bank. From other countries. Via sovereign bonds.

We do it all the time.

Parang sa bank lang. When you apply for a house, car, or personal loan in a bank, do you need to sell assets? Nope. Because you have a credit score that tells the bank you can pay back, and depending on that, they compute the risk of defaulting on your debts and then impose an interest on it.

But yes, selling assets is a thing. You know which countries do that? Countries that have junk ratings. That means no lending body will trust them anymore. Venezuela. Mozambique. Unless they sell, they can't get money. We are NOT in that level. Going back to the bank analogy, kelan ka magsasangla/magbebenta? Pag di ka namakautang diba?

We have higher credit ratings than India. Greece. Turkey. We have the same ratings as Thailand. India has 2,449 billion dollars in debt. Greece has 372 billion. Have you heard of any of those countries selling assets? (Baka nasa Lazada na yung Parthenon at Taj Mahal, check natin mamaya)

We do NOT need to sell anything to fund the Coronavirus budget. And yes, even if all the countries in the world started borrowing money from each other, the amount of money available will not run out because we are on a fiat currency system for decades now (medyo mahabang paliwanagan to so next time na lang)

Contrary to what the doomsayers in the news make you feel, we are actually still in a good fiscal position in terms of debt. In 1999, our debt servicing is equivalent to 60% of our GDP. In 2018, that's 23% of our GDP. That means we can borrow more and still not hurt economically.

tl;dr; We can afford to borrow. Dramarama lang yung benta ng assets. Unless magbenta talaga ng assets, in which case, ibig sabhin gusto lang talaga nila ibenta yung ref sa kusina para bumili ng bago (yung may double door para soshal).

 The following precautions should be observed if you are receiving goods  Please note that the CDC acknowledges the greatest risk of viral transmission is through direct interaction with delivery personnel, store staff, or other customers within a shopping area. 

 Delivered goods--For both grocery items and other delivered goods, our recommendations are as follows: 

1. If the item is non-perishable, you may leave it outside for 1-3 days depending on packaging type. 

2. If the item requires refrigeration: a. Open the packaging and dispose in a receptacle or garbage bag outside. b. Wash each item with soap, water, and a soft vegetable brush for at least 20 seconds. c. Wash hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. 

Prepared food delivery-- Things to decrease risk of viral transmission are the following: 

1. Pay over the phone and request contactless delivery. 

2. Receive packaged meals, open the packaging, wash hands. 

3. Remove food, wash hands. 

4. Dispose of packaging, wash hands.

 Temperatures and times for coronavirus are not yet fully researched, but conclusions from this paper suggest heating food to a temperature of 149°F (65°C) for at least 3 minutes is sufficient. Experts assume that the virus will respond like other pathogens and that hotter temperatures will require shorter times. The virus was shown to be inactivated by ultraviolet light (UV) at 254 nm, and heat treatment of 65 degrees C or greater. 

 [https://www.nih.gov/news-events/news-releases/new-coronavirus-stable-hours-surfaces](https://www.nih.gov/news-events/news-releases/new-coronavirus-stable-hours-surfaces) 

 The virus can persist on cardboard packaging for 24 hours, plastic packaging and steel surfaces for up to 3 days.

 The following precautions should be observed if you are receiving goods or are entering stores to purchase supplies.

 Please note that the CDC acknowledges the greatest risk of viral transmission is through direct interaction with delivery personnel, store staff, or other customers within a shopping area. Secondary risk, they explain further, is viral transmission from touching contaminated public shopping carts or baskets. 

&#x200B;

If entering a grocery store cannot be avoided, please observe the following: 1. Glove prior to entering the store. Completely avoid touching your face during this time. 2. Prior to shopping, sanitize the basket or cart with a sanitizing wipe and dispose immediately. Alternatively, you may bring your own large reusable bag. 3. To check out, use the self-check line, sanitize the scanning screen, touch screen, and belt prior to and after use. 4. Bag your own items both at the self-check and at the regular check-out line. 5. Use hand sanitizer upon leaving the store. 6. Once home, wash perishable goods with soap and water. Anything non-perishable can be left outside for 1-3 days depending on the packaging. If the item is needed, remove all cardboard packaging and dispose; wipe down plastic packaging with disinfecting wipes or with soap and water. 7. Wash hands for at least 20 second with soap and water after handling goods and prior to eating. 

Hope it helps , Keep washing hands"

Why is A&E quieter than usual?

- Everyone is staying at home. This means that there are fewer traffic accidents, fewer mountaineering accidents, fewer biking accidents, just generally fewer of most activities which cause people to need to visit A&E. Is there anything we can learn from that about preventing accidents and injuries? Sure. Does it mean that we shouldn't visit A&E if we're hit by a car after the lockdown ends? That's just silly."

A nonzero amount of leaders in the developed world, citing their economies, will “jump the gun” and relax social distancing guidelines even before their top experts recommend them to. Public pressure from developed-world countries' respective right wings (as well as mixed initial messaging about asymptomatic transmission among other concerns) will accelerate the decision for these leaders. 

Some economists will promote the idea too, arguing that as long as we have a sufficiently low “R” (reinfection rates), we can and should encourage everyone to go ""back out"" and risk their lives, guaranteeing and accepting a percentage dead, for the “sake of the country.”

The virus doesn’t care about our math to jumpstart economies again, or what acceptable death rates might look like. It salivates at the thought: “open again without a vaccine, please.” 

Considering the pending psychiatric pandemics of agoraphobia and enochlophobia (fear of crowds), we could imagine a much more future-proof plane where we find ways to thread our economies through this bottleneck, into states of self-sustained growth without as much in-person contact. Think, turning all stores into warehouses, and everything is either delivered or picked up curbside. It would create new jobs, and countries can still enforce social distancing guidelines in those new, temporary warehouses.

Lastly and perhaps most importantly when thinking about reopening, know that a large majority of consumers will be too spooked to engage with the reopening--consumers will create the next national or district lockdowns, not leaders.

Studies suggest that otherwise healthy patients who recover from COVID-19 are likely to be immune from catching the virus again.

Through a process of “immune memory,” the immune system of recovered patients will cause antibodies to quash a pathogen from infecting the body again if it is detected.

Still, some microbes are not as easily detected, and immunity against these viruses can wane in a few months. Which begs the question: can people become infected with the coronavirus twice? At this early stage of research, no consensus has been reached."

The Black Plague created the Middle Class by demonstrating the value of skilled labor was much higher than it had been valued at. Blackmsiths and similar future Guild industry workers are not easy to replace and are essential to functioning of the Medieval economy. 

The Corona Pandemic is having the opposite effect. It is demonstrating that human presence in low-skill, but highly important industries (groceries, food processing, delivery/logistics) is a liability, not an asset. With the technology to automate these roles being developed, what was left of the Middle Class this century is going to be eradicated by this transformation. Automation will be pushed harder than ever once this is over and millions of jobs will disappear. 

We've seen automation become a bigger and bigger threat to the economy for a long time, but I don't think even Andrew Yang's predictions accounted for an impetus like Coronavirus. I'm quite worried about the future of the economy. Automation and wealth consolidation are both bad for most people."

Chicago’s Rush University Medical Center was built after 9/11 to handle mass casualties. The coronavirus outbreak poses its first big test.

CHICAGO — As this city braces for April 20, the anticipated peak of coronavirus infections here, doctors and nurses at Rush University Medical Center say they are prepared, not just because of their training, but because of where they work: A 14-story, 830,000-square-foot facility built specifically for a deadly pandemic.

The butterfly-shaped building, known as “the Tower,” opened in January 2012 as the first of its kind in the United States. Built at a cost of $654 million in the shadow of 9/11 and the anthrax attacks, the facility was designed to be able to quickly handle waves of patients, expand its bed capacity to 133 percent and control airflow to entire sections of the structure to prevent cross-contamination.

The coronavirus is the first major test of the facility’s strengths and also its agility in the face of a rapidly increasing death toll in Illinois. As of Thursday afternoon, there were 16,422 cases in Illinois, 528 of which resulted in death. Rush has approximately 20 percent of the ventilated cases in the entire state.

“In the wake of 9/11, they began to rethink this idea of how to deal with mass casualties,” said Jerry Johnson of Perkins & Will, the principal architect behind the medical center. “Other hospitals tried to address some of these issues, but it was the first to deal with all of these issues at once with one facility. They were really visionary.”

The first coronavirus patient showed up at Rush on March 4. Eleven days later, the hospital switched to “surge mode” for the first time in its history to accommodate what could be a flood of patients based on modeling.

At Rush, that means an ambulance bay was refashioned into a triage area where up to 100 patients with covid-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus, can be screened each day. Patients sit in chairs spaced 6 feet apart on the concrete floor and wait to be examined in one of two blue tents designed to isolate them from others in the ambulance bay.

“By setting up there, it allows for patients to be kept out of the remaining emergency hospital where they could infect other people. That makes a big difference” in isolating the spread, said Marvina Williams, a senior medical planner at Perkins & Will who led planning for the emergency room.

The bay is also a mass decontamination area where patients and even ambulances can be washed if needed. Under the floor are 10,000-gallon holding tanks to prevent the water used to clean contaminated patients from entering the city’s wastewater system.

Patients with severe covid-19 symptoms are escorted to the emergency room. Those in less severe condition are sent home with a strict 14-day quarantine order.

The permanent emergency room at Rush is unlike most: Instead of curtains, each bed unit has its own set of thick glass doors to seal it off, with a negative-pressure air system to prevent infection from escaping into common areas. Before sliding the doors open, nurses suit up: a yellow smock, a mask, gloves and a pair of goggles. The ER has 60 beds, but during a surge each unit can be doubled to increase capacity to 120 beds.

“We have not doubled up yet, but that is our apocalypse plan, knock on wood,” said Yanina Purim-Shem-Tov, medical director of the Rush Outpatient Chest Pain Center who operates out of the Department of Emergency Medicine.

Under the surge, routine ER patients — someone with a broken ankle, for example — are handled in the building’s main atrium, which has been outfitted as “a MASH unit,” completely cut off from the covid-19 patients in the emergency section, said Purim-Shem-Tov. The atrium’s design made the transformation easy: Disguised inside every support column are panels giving access to oxygen and other necessary medical gases, as well as electricity. Non-emergency physicians, such as pediatricians, are staffing the MASH unit.

Using the atrium as an extra medical bay is an idea that originated at Rush, said Williams. The scene is quite different at older hospitals in coronavirus hot spots around the country, such as New York City.

“Nowadays you are seeing overloaded hallways and you have to bring in oxygen by portable tanks,” Williams said. “Having the foresight to do something like that really made a difference.”"

Yes every government we’ve had since Thatcher has fucked the public sector consistently every time a new budget has been released. And yes people seemingly mindlessly vote for the same people knowing exactly what will happen when the bastards in charge carve up the budgets. But in this time when so much is being asked of those who work in the NHS and those who have returned from retirement. People who are being asked to literally fight a pandemic with little to no protection whilst the rest of us are being told to hide in our homes. The least we can do as a nation at this moment is unite to clap for them and literally show our love for Our NHS! And no offence but all you’ve done is not clap and then make a post on Reddit?

Pastors throughout America ignore at their peril examples like the megachurch at the outbreak's epicenter in South Korea that accounted for half of that  country's total cases. Or a Sunday mass in March in Paris that resulted in 2,000 known cases.

Where's the line though when it comes to what public health measures are acceptable in a democratic country?

Well, [85% of Canadians](http://www.nationalpost.com/Canadians+willing+suspend+liberties+pandemic+poll/2024882/story.html) agree that asking people to suspend their civil liberties “is legitimate, *for a time limited period, if it’s clearly communicated and measures for support are put in place* \[emphasis added\]”. And half agreed that a violation of a quarantine is  tantamount to manslaughter.

Most Americans though are more social-minded about quarantining than the prosperity church pastors. According to [USA-Today/Gallup](https://www.usatoday.com/in-depth/news/nation/2020/04/03/coronavirus-poll-americans-saving-lives-economy-public-agenda/5098766002/), 9 out 10 Americans polled supported \*stronger\* corona measures, including cancelling group events. So those who wrap themselves in the American Constitution today should perhaps re-read the \*entire\* Preamble which provides for not only *liberty*, but *justice*, *common defense*, *tranquility*, and *general welfare. N.B.* none of those guarantees is paramount or set above the others: it's a balancing act. Civil and human rights must be protected during the pandemic but congregating in groups now is with certainty acting against the general welfare and probably against justice (the rights of others). You know, ""We the People"". That part."

Start with the main storyline, which includes Zero and all of the Stay Night routes. I recommend Zero first, as it's a prequel for the others and an easy entry point. Stay Night has 3 routes (alternative timelines): the original Stay Night, Stay Night: Unlimited Blade Works, and Stay Night: Heaven's feel. Watch those in any order. The original Stay Night is older and not quite up to the quality of the others, but I still enjoyed it. Heaven's Feel is a sequence of 3 movies instead of a TV series, and the final movie has yet to release (got delayed by coronavirus).

Aside from those, pretty much anything else is a spin-off/alternate universe that don't really tie in to the main story."

**""Because of you, my graduation is cancelled,"" said another.** 

**There was also another post that said: ""Because of you, I lost my job.""**

**These negative messages were among the many that Sita Tyasutami received since last month. She also got death threats.**

**The 30-year-old is known in Indonesia as Case 01, the first person who was tested positive for COVID-19 in the country.** 

She has since recovered from the illness, but hate messages are still appearing in her social media accounts.

“They still get me sometimes,” she told CNA during a phone interview on Monday (Apr 6).

Tyasutami,  who is a professional dancer and an independent performing arts  manager, was declared positive on Mar 2, after being sick for some days.

When President Joko Widodo broke the news on that Monday morning that  the country had its first two COVID-19 cases, Tyasutami did not even  know that she had the disease.

Although she and her mother Maria  Darmaningsih, who became known as Case 02, were already warded in  separate rooms at Jakarta’s Infectious Disease Hospital Sulianti Saroso,  it never crossed her mind that they both had COVID-19.

Tyasutami’s older sister Ratri Anindyajati, who is an independent  producer and arts manager, was the one who broke the news to her mother.

“Ratri called me. She was so nervous,” Darmaningsih, 64, recounted.

“I turned on the TV and I saw the news about[ Mr Jokowi announcing the country’s first two COVID-19 cases](https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/asia/coronavirus-indonesia-confirms-first-cases-covid-19-12490574). I was like: 'Oh my goodness' ... I felt so broken.""

A nurse was coincidently in Darmaningsih’s room when Anindyajati called.

But she couldn’t verify whether Darminingsih and her younger daughter Tyasutami had COVID-19.

**MEDIA FRENZY AT THEIR HOUSE**

Mr Widodo did not  mention the names of the country’s first two COVID-19 cases. But within  minutes, messages started to circulate on Whatsapp indicating  Tyasutami’s and Darmaningsih’s initials. Their health records  and complete home address were also made known.

A few hours after  Mr Widodo made the announcement, the health minister also held a press  conference revealing details and the medical history of Case 01 and 02.  What was announced matched the profile of Tyasutami and Darmaningsih.

“I asked a nurse who was visiting me in my room whether there were  other patients currently warded at the hospital,” said Tyasutami.

“The nurse said no. So it must be us the president was talking about!” Tyasutami recounted.

At that stage, the nurses said they had no details on what was going on.

Tyasutami  and her mother later found out that it is the protocol in Indonesia  that during a specific disease outbreak, the president must first be  informed before the patients are made aware.

The day did not unfold well, according to Tyasutami, Darmaningsih and Anindyajati.

A flood of messages filled their handphones, asking them various questions.

Journalists  flocked to their house in Depok city, on the outskirts of Jakarta,  while health officials raced to disinfect their house and test everyone  living there, including Anindyajati.

The 33-year-old artist  actually resides in Vienna, Austria, but she has been in Indonesia since  February for professional and family matters.

**ALL THREE TESTED POSITIVE FOR COVID-19**  

Just like her younger sister and her mother, Anindyajati was ill towards the end of February.

All three of them had been suffering from a combination of complaints such as itchy throat, fever and joint pain.

But Anindyajati quickly recovered and took her mother and sister to a local hospital in Depok on Feb 27.

Tyasutami was originally diagnosed with bronchopneumonia and Darmaningsih with typhus.

They were both hospitalised. Tyasutami later heard from a friend that  she had attended the same dance event as a foreigner. The latter later  went to Malaysia and tested positive for COVID-19.

Tyasutami did not know the lady but she immediately thought that she should be swabbed for COVID-19.

She and her mother were then transferred from the hospital in Depok to Jakarta’s Infectious Disease Hospital Sulianti Saroso.

Once officials knew Tyasutami and Darmaningsih were COVID-19 positive, Anindyajati also underwent a swab test.

Her result was also positive. She was warded at the same hospital on Mar 5 and became known as the country’s Case 03."

The social scene can be great if you're the sort of person who thrives in a very nerdy environment - I personally love the community here. We're very much not a party school. There are plenty of clubs to get involved with if that's your thing. Student life can be difficult for people not suited to this sort of environment, but a lot of the students love the student life here.

The administration is the largest weak point, but most people won't need to interact with them much or deal with their bs (disregarding the chaos this year from the coronavirus).

Tips For Social Distancing, Quarantine, And Isolation During An Infectious Disease Outbreak
What Is Social Distancing?

Social distancing is a way to keep people from interacting closely or frequently enough to spread an infectious disease. Schools and other gathering places such as movie theaters may close, and sports events and religious services may be cancelled.

What Is Quarantine?

Quarantine separates and restricts the movement of people who have been exposed to a contagious disease to see if they become sick. It lasts long enough to ensure the person has not contracted an infectious disease.

What Is Isolation?

Isolation prevents the spread of an infectious disease by separating people who are sick from those who are not. It lasts as long as the disease is contagious.

What To Expect: Typical Reactions
Everyone reacts differently to stressful situations such as an infectious disease outbreak that requires social distancing, quarantine, or isolation. People may feel:

Anxiety, worry, or fear related to:
Your own health status
The health status of others whom you may have exposed to the disease
The resentment that your friends and family may feel if they need to go into quarantine as a result of contact with you
The experience of monitoring yourself, or being monitored by others for signs and symptoms of the disease
Time taken off from work and the potential loss of income and job security
The challenges of securing things you need, such as groceries and personal care items
Concern about being able to effectively care for children or others in your care
Uncertainty or frustration about how long you will need to remain in this situation, and uncertainty about the future
Loneliness associated with feeling cut off from the world and from loved ones
Anger if you think you were exposed to the disease because of others’ negligence
Boredom and frustration because you may not be able to work or engage in regular day-to-day activities
Uncertainty or ambivalence about the situation
A desire to use alcohol or drugs to cope
Symptoms of depression, such as feelings of hopelessness, changes in appetite, or sleeping too little or too much
Symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), such as intrusive distressing memories, flashbacks (reliving the event), nightmares, changes in thoughts and mood, and being easily startled.
Ways To Support Yourself During Social Distancing, Quarantine, and Isolation
UNDERSTAND THE RISK
Consider the real risk of harm to yourself and others around you. The public perception of risk during a situation such as an infectious disease outbreak is often inaccurate. Media coverage may create the impression that people are in immediate danger when really the risk for infection may be very low. Take steps to get the facts:

Stay up to date on what is happening, while limiting your media exposure. Avoid watching or listening to news reports 24/7 since this tends to increase anxiety and worry. Remember that children are especially affected by what they hear and see on television.
Look to credible sources for information on the infectious disease outbreak.
BE YOUR OWN ADVOCATE
Speaking out about your needs is particularly important if you are in quarantine, since you may not be in a hospital or other facility where your basic needs are met. Ensure you have what you need to feel safe, secure, and comfortable.

Work with local, state, or national health officials to find out how you can arrange for groceries and toiletries to be delivered to your home as needed.
Inform health care providers or health authorities of any needed medications and work with them to ensure that you continue to receive those medications.
EDUCATE YOURSELF
Health care providers and health authorities should provide information on the disease, its diagnosis, and treatment.

Do not be afraid to ask questions—clear communication with a health care provider may help reduce any distress associated with social distancing, quarantine, or isolation.
Ask for written information when available.
Ask a family member or friend to obtain information in the event that you are unable to secure this information on your own.
WORK WITH YOUR EMPLOYER TO REDUCE FINANCIAL STRESS
If you’re unable to work during this time, you may experience stress related to your job status or financial situation.

Provide your employer with a clear explanation of why you are away from work.
Contact the U.S. Department of Labor tollfree at 1-866-487-2365 about the Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA), which allows U.S. employees up to 12 weeks of unpaid leave for serious medical conditions, or to care for a family member with a serious medical condition.
Contact your utility providers, cable and Internet provider, and other companies from whom you get monthly bills to explain your situation and request alternative bill payment arrangements as needed.
CONNECT WITH OTHERS
Reaching out to people you trust is one of the best ways to reduce anxiety, depression, loneliness, and boredom during social distancing, quarantine, and isolation. You can:

Use the telephone, email, text messaging, and social media to connect with friends, family, and others.
Talk “face to face” with friends and loved ones using Skype or FaceTime.
If approved by health authorities and your health care providers, arrange for your friends and loved ones to bring you newspapers, movies, and books.
Sign up for emergency alerts via text or email to ensure you get updates as soon as they are available.
Call SAMHSA’s free 24-hour Disaster Distress Helpline at 1-800-985-5990, if you feel lonely or need support.
Use the Internet, radio, and television to keep up with local, national, and world events.
If you need to connect with someone because of an ongoing alcohol or drug problem, consider calling your local Alcoholics Anonymous or Narcotics Anonymous offices.
TALK TO YOUR DOCTOR
If you are in a medical facility, you may have access to health care providers who can answer your questions. However, if you are quarantined at home, and you’re worried about physical symptoms you or your loved ones may be experiencing, call your doctor or other health care provider:

Ask your provider whether it would be possible to schedule remote appointments via Skype or FaceTime for mental health, substance use, or physical health needs.
USE PRACTICAL WAYS TO COPE AND RELAX
Relax your body often by doing things that work for you-take deep breaths, stretch, meditate or pray, or engage in activities you enjoy.
Pace yourself between stressful activities, and do something fun after a hard task.
Talk about your experiences and feelings to loved ones and friends, if you find it helpful.
Maintain a sense of hope and positive thinking; consider keeping a journal where you write down things you are grateful for or that are going well

There's never gonna be a vaccine for this.  There's never been a successful vaccine for any other coronavirus.  It's from the same family as most common colds...  It'll burn itself out naturally, when enough people have caught it, and either died or got better.  Herd immunity, eventually.  Or, it'll settle into a steady pattern, help slow down overpopulation a bit.  

The shutdown isn't to avoid people catching it until they come up with a vaccine.  That's over-optimistic hype to stop the sheep from panicking.  It's just to prevent too many people from catching at once, and overwhelming the hospitals & undertakers.  

Flattening the curve doesn't imply any reduction in the total number of deaths from it.  Just means spreading them out over a longer time period.  So it doesn't cause more deaths, as a side-effect of overwhelmed hospitals."

* Canadian data from virihealth.com (from PHAC & provinces), USA data from coronavirus.1point3acres.com, Other national data was from WHO sitrep 80.
* I am not an epidemiologist. I'm not a government employee. I don't even play a doctor on TV. I just like numbers.

This data is admittedly imperfect: testing is incomplete, there is a test backlog, and reporting is not completely fluid.  This is too simplistic a model for realistic projection, given all of the unknowns and variables of such a complex system.  That said, I'll continue to track this, to see where it goes.

Today's data notes:  

* Nationally, 1530 are hospitalized (+71 from yesterday), and 559 are in ICU (+41). Virihealth.com is doing a much better job tracking these than I. As these numbers climb, the burden on our healthcare workers will increase. Godspeed and thanks to them as they stand on guard for thee and me. 
* Deaths hit a new ghastly high with 73 today, 41 in QC and 26 in ON. The national total is 508 deaths (2.45% of known positives - this is not really the mortality rate, since that won't be known until all those infected are recovered or not, and may vary significantly if the healthcare system is overwhelmed)
* People tested (+13,869) = 370,315 (1.02% of the population - finally > 1%!). This was about the same as yesterday, but still down from nearly 20K/day which we were seeing a week or 2 ago. 
* Tested positive (+1474) = 20,765 (5.40% of those tested). The cumulative hit rate climbs from 5.21% yesterday, rising 16 days in a row. The higher hit rate is concerning, particularly in QC(9.6% overall) and ON (6.6% overall).  
* Test backlog - total is 4966, up from 4425 yesterday. 
* Recovered = 5311 (25.58% of known positives), surpassing 5K and 25% (of known), nice. 
* Known active = 14,946 (Total positives - recovered - deceased). The unknowns are unknown. 
* The bump in China's number @ day 29 was due to a change in the way their cases were categorized.
* The growth rate appears in cases seems to be slowing. Higher doubling time is better. March16 - doubling rate= every 2.84 days; March23=2.74 days; Mar30=4.21 days. My latest calc is doubling every 8.19 days. 
* In the world, Russia took a big jump today to go above 10K cases; this may be one to watch in the weeks to come. Sweden is another one to watch, where an initial ""herd immunity"" strategy has 687 deaths/8419 known cases, a very high death rate (or way too many unknowns)."

China broke the World Health Organization. The U.S. has to fix it or leave and start its own group.

 By Lanhee J. Chen

April 8, 2020 12:58 pm ET 

The World Health Organization isn’t just “China centric,” as President Trump called it on Tuesday. It is also broken and compromised. The WHO fell short in its dithering reaction to the 2014 Ebola outbreak in West Africa, which claimed more than 11,000 lives. Now its response to the coronavirus pandemic shows it is willing to put politics ahead of public health. The way the WHO has consistently acted to placate China’s leaders makes clear the need for fundamental reform.

The U.S. is the biggest financial contributor to the WHO—more than $400 million in 2019, when China sent only $44 million, according to the U.S. State Department. Mr. Trump suggested that the U.S. might hold its funding while his administration takes a “good look” at what the country is getting for its money. He and Congress should go further.  
While Washington pays, Beijing works behind the scenes to influence WHO leaders. The current director-general, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, was backed strongly by the Chinese government during his campaign for the job. Mr. Tedros was a controversial pick, dogged by allegations of having covered up cholera outbreaks in his native Ethiopia, where he served as health minister (2005-12) and foreign minister (2012-16). During those years, China invested in Ethiopia and lent it billions of dollars. Shortly after winning his WHO election, Mr. Tedros traveled to Beijing and lauded the country’s health-care system: “We can all learn something from China.”  
Under Mr. Tedros’s leadership, the WHO has accepted China’s falsehoods about the coronavirus and helped launder them into respectable-looking public-health assessments.

On Jan. 14, before an official WHO delegation had even visited China, the group parroted Beijing’s claim that there was “no clear evidence of human-to-human transmission.” Two weeks later, after China had reported more than 4,500 cases of the virus and over 70 people in other countries were sick with it, Mr. Tedros visited China and heaped praise on its leaders for their “transparency.”

Recall that China waited six weeks after patients first saw symptoms in Wuhan to institute a lockdown there. During this time Chinese authorities censored and punished physicians who tried to sound the alarm, repeatedly denied that the virus could be transmitted between humans, and held a public banquet in Wuhan for tens of thousands of families. In the meantime, more than five million people left or fled Wuhan, according to the city’s mayor. This included the patient with the [first confirmed case](https://archive.is/o/l0h60/https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2001191?mod=article_inline) of the virus in America.

The WHO finally declared a public-health emergency on Jan. 30, after nearly 10,000 cases of the virus had been confirmed. China’s reported figures rose in early February to more than 17,000 infections and 361 deaths, yet Mr. Tedros rebuked Mr. Trump for restricting travel from China and urged other countries not to follow suit. He called the virus’s spread outside China “minimal and slow.” It took until March 11 for the WHO to declare a pandemic. By that point the official world-wide case count was 118,000 people in 114 countries.

China’s influence is also apparent in the WHO’s exclusion of Taiwan. The WHO didn’t even bother [replying](https://archive.is/o/l0h60/https://www.economist.com/asia/2020/03/26/let-taiwan-into-the-world-health-organisation?mod=article_inline) to Taiwanese inquiries in December about whether the coronavirus could, contrary to Beijing’s claims, be transmitted between humans.

Last month a Hong Kong TV reporter [asked](https://archive.is/o/l0h60/https://twitter.com/HKWORLDCITY/status/1243865641448169474?mod=article_inline) Bruce Aylward, who leads the WHO-China Joint Mission on Coronavirus, if the organization would reconsider its refusal to allow Taiwan to join. Dr. Aylward, on a remote video connection, sits silent and expressionless for nearly 10 seconds before the reporter prompts him again: “Hello?”

“I’m sorry,” he finally says, “I couldn’t hear—I can’t hear your question, Yvonne.”

“Let me repeat the question,” she says.

“No, that’s OK. Let’s move to another one then.”

When she presses him on Taiwan, he terminates the connection. The reporter calls back and tries a different tack: “I just want to see if you can comment a bit on how Taiwan has done so far in terms of containing the virus.”

His reply: “Well, we’ve already talked about China, and, you know, when you look across all the different areas of China, they’ve actually all done quite a good job.”

The exchange demonstrates how the WHO prioritizes politics over public health. It has internalized Beijing’s view of Taiwan and seeks to praise China’s leaders at every turn. And at no point during the crisis has the WHO substantively investigated the Chinese regime’s claims about the virus or been transparent about the thinking behind its decisions.

As the biggest financial contributor to the WHO, the U.S. has the leverage to push for radical reform. Congress should condition all future funding on the WHO’s explaining in detail how it reaches its public-health decisions and rigorously and independently investigating the extent of disease outbreaks.

The U.S. should work aggressively to change the culture and leadership of the WHO. The Trump administration took a good first step in January by creating a special envoy at the State Department focused on countering China’s attempts to control international organizations. The WHO’s next director-general must not be a rubber stamp for Beijing.

If efforts to transform the WHO are ineffective, the U.S. may have no choice but to walk away and start over. That could mean creating an alternative organization open to any country willing to abide by higher standards of transparency, good governance and the sharing of best practices. The world needs an organization that can be trusted to address public-health problems that transcend borders—if not the WHO, then something else.

My parents are divorced, living in towns 2 hours apart from each other. I have 4 siblings, two of which are now in college and the other two are in HS living with my mom in town A. Growing up we all lived with my mom in town A and visited my dad in town B every other weekend and holidays. I moved permanently to town B for college and I live with my dad. My other college aged siblings went to college 7 hours away in town C.

That's where we were at before COVID closed down our schools. Now I was forced to decide if I wanted to stay in town B or go home and spend quarantine with my family in town A. It was a very difficult decision, but I decided to stay because 1) I couldn't leave my dad alone here in town B and 2) it would be very difficult focusing on school with 6 people packed in my mom's house. When I told my mom this decision, she said that was OK, but I would not be allowed to return to town A until life returned to normal. Which was harsh, but from her perspective, one of my little brothers in town A has asthma and can be considered at-risk.

One of my brothers in college quickly chose to stay in town A. The other went back to town A, but told me and my dad that he wants to come to town B to focus on school. He was just about convinced he was gonna do it until he found out our mom isn't allowing me back to town A. Additionally, she won't allow any of my siblings to visit town B if they wanted to come back before this is over (my brother with asthma isn't allowed to leave at all). When my college brother told my dad this, he was pissed. Obviously, he wants to keep asthma brother safe, but he also wants to see his kids and feels my mom is being way too precautious and making it into a ""pick between your parents"" thing. He also feels bad for me that I'm essentially trapped here although I told him that town B is my home now and I wouldn't have visited town A often even if there was no virus scare. My brother coming permanently to town B isn't off the table yet but he still hasn't made up his mind.

This is very hard because I truly can empathize with both sides here. Currently town B only has ~150 cases with a population of almost 300k. Although Town A has even less cases, the odds that me or my father have coronavirus is slim to none. My dad feels that his kids are being intimidated not to visit us which is pretty much true. While he admits that having my healthy siblings going back and forth increases the risk of infection for asthma brother, he feels that at this stage the risk is negligible and again I think he's probably right. But on the flip side, as my mom points out, there is a chance, and we're possibly playing with my brothers life here. The only way she can guarantee he stays safe is by keeping my family in town A strictly quarantined. She does miss me, but she always believes I was free to make my decision and now that it's made she has to take care of the rest of her family.

Personally, I would love my brother's company up here, if he should choose to do that. I'm not gonna force him up here but I feel that my mom is impacting his ability to make his own decision. But when I think about calling my mom to talk about it all of a sudden my mind goes from dad mode to mom mode and I can understand why she's doing the things she's doing. So my dilemma is, do I call my mom and try to talk her into allowing travel between the two towns or just let her do her thing and stay here with my dad while my college brother is stuck up there? This is hard man. I've never had so many ethical dilemmas in the space of a month."

In the organisation that I work in, in which everyone loves to gossip about everything, most of the older people who discussed it were cross when they initially left - thought that they had been disrespectful to the Queen, that Meghan and Harry's experiences were nowhere near as traumatic as living through WW2, having family members killed in revolutions or by the IRA like other members of the BRF, or even acting as an emotional crutch for Diana like William in the divorce, and thought they were massive hypocrites. The younger crowd, which also contained far more people of colour, were initially a lot more sympathetic and thought that Meghan had really been treated cruelly by the press and that Harry seemed so traumatised that it was kinder to let them go.

That shifted quite a bit when all the arguments over security aired, as no one liked the idea of forking out extra millions for them to live abroad. When the whole stuff about the branding struggles came out, a bunch of young nurses were discussing it and one said that they could do far more good by living in a small flat in London and channelling all their excess money to the NHS 'but then they wouldn't get to go on red carpets all the time'. Everyone seemed pleased that they didn't get to keep the SR brand. There was also a lot of positive discussions about the Cambridges, though I think that there's a bit of a bias there because one of the charities that Kate supports apparently contributes directly towards trust funding in our area for extra equipment.

My vote goes to this lie.

In fact, foreigners' offers of help don't matter all that much because the CCP doesn't even accept them them half of the time. Case in point: The US CDC offered to share their expertise with the Chinese government early in the coronavirus crisis, and never even received a reply for months.

And even when help from foreigners is accepted, you've got to be out of your mind to think it would be publicly appreciated.

2020-04-09,Demandredz,wallstreetbets,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fxkud3/this_is_what_is_actually_going_on/fmvcby3/,"No coronavirus has ever had a vaccine commercialized successfully.  They have spent more than 7 years in trying to do so for MERS.  Even with tons of cash, the bottleneck is that it takes time to do trials, there is no chance of a vaccine by fall. Unlike other treatments, because it will be deployed en masse to otherwise healthy people that likely wouldn't be substantially harmed by Covid, it has to have essentially no side effects.  Given all that, even 18 months is very optimistic, as the average vaccine takes 10 years to develop.  I think we are gonna spend a ton of money and with dozens of companies on it, this will shatter records in vaccine commercialization time but that still puts it at about  12 months if stars align but realistically 18 or more.  See: https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/31/us/coronavirus-vaccine-timetable-concerns-experts-invs/index.html

There's a similar argument made in the National Review as well. I completely agree that this mostly kills folks that are older, obese etc... who generally do not contribute as much to GDP.  Here's the thing, no modern day politician in the US can say ""I am fine with 1 million+ of you old or obese people dying, we aren't going to murder the economy.""  I agree with you, the death rate is likely overstated, its a fair bit worse than even the bad 2018 flu year, but its not MERS, not by a long shot.  None of that matters if policy makers don't give a shit, Cuomo basically said that they shutdown and if it saves one life, it's worth it.  Everyone loves him, even though that's a batshit insane thing to say.  You can save 20,000 lives by dropping the speed limit 20 mph, but no one would ever do that.

Just like with the flu, there's limited possible treatments just by the nature of the disease, otherwise we wouldn't lose 60k to the flu some years.  As long as policy makers are unwilling to herd immunity this out like Sweden, and given that a vaccine won't be ready for at least 12 and more likely 18 months, it is what it is.  I don't love that millions of small business owners are going to lose everything they worked for due to government policy, but the states have clearly decided that's what they are going to do because no politician has any other choice for political survival."

Wuhan to Shanghai = 839km
Wuhan to Beijing  = 1,152km
Wuhan to Milan  = 15,000km
Wuhan to NY = 15,000km

The Coronavirus started in Wuhan yet there is no effect of Coronavirus in nearby Beijing or Shanghai but many deaths in Italy, Iran, European countries and USA.

All business areas of China are now safe.

*Something is fishy.*

America is not just blaming China without a reason. 

Even today, India is locked down but all the cities of China are open. China has also announced the opening of Wuhan from April 08. Not a single leader in China has tested positive for the deadly Coronavirus.

*Something is fishy.*

The virus has ruined many economies around the world. Many have had to close their borders in an attempt to contain and control the spread of the Coronavirus. Thousands have lost their lives, millions have now got this disease, countless people have been locked in their homes and many countries have placed their citizens on lock down.

*Something is fishy.*

The Coronavirus orginated from the city of Wuhan in China and has now reached every corner of the world, but the virus did not reach China's capital Beijing and China's Economic Capital Shanghai, located in close proximity to Wuhan itself.

*Something is fishy*

Today Paris is closed, New York is closed, Berlin is closed, Delhi is closed, Mumbai is closed, Tokyo is closed, the world's major economic and political centers are closed, but Beijing and Shanghai are open. No Coronavirus effect is seen in either cities. There were only a few cases but the virus had no real effect on Beijing and Shanghai.

*Something is fishy.*

Beijing is the city where all the leaders of China live, including their military leaders. There is no lock down in Beijing.

*Something is fishy*

Shanghai is the city that runs China's economy. It is the economic capital of China, where all the rich people of China live and run major industries. There is no lock down here, there is no effect of the Coronavirus there.

*Something is fishy*

Beijing and Shanghai are the areas adjoining Wuhan. The virus from Wuhan reached every corner of the world, but the virus did not affect Beijing and Shanghai.

*Something is fishy*

Another big thing is, that the worldwide share market has fallen by almost half. In India also the Nifty has gone from 12 thousand to 7 thousand, but the share market of China was at 3000 and just merely dropped to 2700.

*Something is fishy*

This leaves one to speculate that the Coronavirus is a bio-chemical weapon of China, which China used to carry out destruction in the world in order to gain economic supremacy. 

China has now put this virus under control, maybe they also have the antidote/ vaccine that they are not sharing with the world ever or will do when it is in their best interest to do so.

*Something is fishy*

Hollywood stars, Australia's Home Minister, Britain's Prime Minister and Health Minister, Spain's Prime Minister's wife, Canada's Prime Minister's wife, and Britain's Prince Charles, among others, have contracted the Coronavirus, but NOT A SINGLE POLITICAL LEADER  IN  CHINA, NOT A SINGLE  MILITARY COMMANDER in China have tested positive for Coronavirus.

The coronavirus may be “reactivating” in people who have been cured of the illness, according to Korea’s Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

About 51 patients classed as having been cured in South Korea have tested positive again, the CDC said in a briefing on Monday. Rather than being infected again, the virus may have been reactivated in these people, given they tested positive again shortly after being released from quarantine, said Jeong Eun-kyeong, director-general of the Korean CDC.

“While we are putting more weight on reactivation as the possible cause, we are conducting a comprehensive study on this,” Jeong said. “There have been many cases when a patient during treatment will test negative one day and positive another.”

South Korea was one of the earliest countries to see a large-scale coronavirus outbreak, but the country has seen just 200 deaths and a falling new case tally since peaking at 1,189 on Feb. 29. One of the world’s most expansive testing programs and a tech-driven approach to tracing infections has seen Korea contain its epidemic without lockdowns or shuttering businesses.

Fear of re-infection in recovered patients is also growing in China, where the virus first emerged last December, after reports that some tested positive again -- and even died from the disease -- after supposedly recovering and leaving hospital. There’s little understanding of why this happens, although some believe that the problem may lie in inconsistencies in test results.

As of Wednesday, South Korea had 10,384 virus cases, with 6,776 released from hospital, according to data compiled by Johns Hopkins University and Bloomberg News.

Epidemiologists around the world are in a race to find out more about the virus that causes Covid-19. The pathogen’s rapid global spread has recently seen the focus shift to patients who contract the virus but display few or atypical symptoms. Korea has been at the forefront of tracking these cases, which are causing particular concern in China, where the epidemic is showing signs of coming under control."

Tips For Social Distancing, Quarantine, And Isolation During An Infectious Disease Outbreak

What Is Social Distancing?

Social distancing is a way to keep people from interacting closely or frequently enough to spread an infectious disease. Schools and other gathering places such as movie theaters may close, and sports events and religious services may be cancelled.

What Is Quarantine?

Quarantine separates and restricts the movement of people who have been exposed to a contagious disease to see if they become sick. It lasts long enough to ensure the person has not contracted an infectious disease.

What Is Isolation?

Isolation prevents the spread of an infectious disease by separating people who are sick from those who are not. It lasts as long as the disease is contagious.

What To Expect: Typical Reactions

Everyone reacts differently to stressful situations such as an infectious disease outbreak that requires social distancing, quarantine, or isolation. People may feel:

•	⁠Anxiety, worry, or fear related to:
•	⁠Your own health status
•	⁠The health status of others whom you may have exposed to the disease
•	⁠The resentment that your friends and family may feel if they need to go into quarantine as a result of contact with you
•	⁠The experience of monitoring yourself, or being monitored by others for signs and symptoms of the disease
•	⁠Time taken off from work and the potential loss of income and job security
•	⁠The challenges of securing things you need, such as groceries and personal care items
•	⁠Concern about being able to effectively care for children or others in your care
•	⁠Uncertainty or frustration about how long you will need to remain in this situation, and uncertainty about the future
•	⁠Loneliness associated with feeling cut off from the world and from loved ones
•	⁠Anger if you think you were exposed to the disease because of others’ negligence
•	⁠Boredom and frustration because you may not be able to work or engage in regular day-to-day activities
•	⁠Uncertainty or ambivalence about the situation
•	⁠A desire to use alcohol or drugs to cope
•	⁠Symptoms of depression, such as feelings of hopelessness, changes in appetite, or sleeping too little or too much
•	⁠Symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), such as intrusive distressing memories, flashbacks (reliving the event), nightmares, changes in thoughts and mood, and being easily startled.

Ways To Support Yourself During Social Distancing, Quarantine, and Isolation

UNDERSTAND THE RISK

Consider the real risk of harm to yourself and others around you. The public perception of risk during a situation such as an infectious disease outbreak is often inaccurate. Media coverage may create the impression that people are in immediate danger when really the risk for infection may be very low. Take steps to get the facts:

•	⁠Stay up to date on what is happening, while limiting your media exposure. Avoid watching or listening to news reports 24/7 since this tends to increase anxiety and worry. Remember that children are especially affected by what they hear and see on television.
•	⁠Look to credible sources for information on the infectious disease outbreak.

BE YOUR OWN ADVOCATE

Speaking out about your needs is particularly important if you are in quarantine, since you may not be in a hospital or other facility where your basic needs are met. Ensure you have what you need to feel safe, secure, and comfortable.

•	⁠Work with local, state, or national health officials to find out how you can arrange for groceries and toiletries to be delivered to your home as needed.
•	⁠Inform health care providers or health authorities of any needed medications and work with them to ensure that you continue to receive those medications.

EDUCATE YOURSELF

Health care providers and health authorities should provide information on the disease, its diagnosis, and treatment.

•	⁠Do not be afraid to ask questions—clear communication with a health care provider may help reduce any distress associated with social distancing, quarantine, or isolation.
•	⁠Ask for written information when available.
•	⁠Ask a family member or friend to obtain information in the event that you are unable to secure this information on your own.

WORK WITH YOUR EMPLOYER TO REDUCE FINANCIAL STRESS

If you’re unable to work during this time, you may experience stress related to your job status or financial situation.

•	⁠Provide your employer with a clear explanation of why you are away from work.
•	⁠Contact the U.S. Department of Labor tollfree at 1-866-487-2365 about the Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA), which allows U.S. employees up to 12 weeks of unpaid leave for serious medical conditions, or to care for a family member with a serious medical condition.
•	⁠Contact your utility providers, cable and Internet provider, and other companies from whom you get monthly bills to explain your situation and request alternative bill payment arrangements as needed.

CONNECT WITH OTHERS

Reaching out to people you trust is one of the best ways to reduce anxiety, depression, loneliness, and boredom during social distancing, quarantine, and isolation. You can:

•	⁠Use the telephone, email, text messaging, and social media to connect with friends, family, and others.
•	⁠Talk “face to face” with friends and loved ones using Skype or FaceTime.
•	⁠If approved by health authorities and your health care providers, arrange for your friends and loved ones to bring you newspapers, movies, and books.
•	⁠Sign up for emergency alerts via text or email to ensure you get updates as soon as they are available.
•	⁠Call SAMHSA’s free 24-hour Disaster Distress Helpline at 1-800-985-5990, if you feel lonely or need support.
•	⁠Use the Internet, radio, and television to keep up with local, national, and world events.
•	⁠If you need to connect with someone because of an ongoing alcohol or drug problem, consider calling your local Alcoholics Anonymous or Narcotics Anonymous offices.

TALK TO YOUR DOCTOR

If you are in a medical facility, you may have access to health care providers who can answer your questions. However, if you are quarantined at home, and you’re worried about physical symptoms you or your loved ones may be experiencing, call your doctor or other health care provider:

•	⁠Ask your provider whether it would be possible to schedule remote appointments via Skype or FaceTime for mental health, substance use, or physical health needs.

USE PRACTICAL WAYS TO COPE AND RELAX

•	⁠Relax your body often by doing things that work for you-take deep breaths, stretch, meditate or pray, or engage in activities you enjoy.
•	⁠Pace yourself between stressful activities, and do something fun after a hard task.
•	⁠Talk about your experiences and feelings to loved ones and friends, if you find it helpful.
•	⁠Maintain a sense of hope and positive thinking; consider keeping a journal where you write down things you are grateful for or that are going well

The point of the shelter-in-place was never to eradicate the virus, but to slow the spread. 

So as this virus works its way through the population (the stay at home orders have to end eventually), there are going to be some people who sadly won’t survive no matter how much medical equipment is available. If an entire nation of hundreds of millions of people *eventually* get the virus and health experts say this is 10x more lethal than the flu, how can we possibly think only 60,000 people will perish? 

Then I start thinking “well, maybe the virus really is widespread and most of the population does have it and the death rate is super low? But then why are the majority of people who get a Coronavirus test being told they don’t have it? 

60,000 lost is still unbelievably tragic! But it would be comforting news among the other projections. I guess the math is just not computing for me.

The US federal government seized an order of 3 million N95 masks headed to Onatrio. They had to get masks from China instead. The Chinese masks were subpar and taken out of circulation, likely after Canadians were infected as a result. Ontario is scheduled to run out of masks later this week despite being guaranteed masks by 3M. The orders for the masks were placed while Trump was still calling the Coronavirus a democratic hoax.

Meanwhile, over 1000 Canadian medical professionals continued crossing the border into Detroit to treat diseased Americans, many of whom have since tested positive for the virus they caught while saving american lives.

I went to a top20 program in my field. I had a few small pubs when I was on the market, but I was really marketing myself as a teacher more than a researcher, because that was truly what I wanted to do. I wanted to teach. I did not want the R1 life. I also intuitively understood that I would not be competitive for those positions.

I applied for more than 200 jobs. I got five campus visits (one school brought me out twice!) and two offers. I'll summarize the offer particulars here, but keep in mind this was a decade ago so my recollections may not be perfect and the figures should be adjusted for inflation. I am in the social sciences.

Offer 1: Small private two year college in a highly desirable (to me) part of the country. Job itself was not particularly prestigious but the town/region the college is in has something like 20 other small liberal arts colleges so I really liked the ""vibe"" of the place and thought I could be happy there. 5/5 load. $40,000 salary. School did not have tenure but after four years contracts have no end date.

Offer 2: Small private four year Catholic college in a less desirable part of the country. College was known in its niche as having a very distinctive and, frankly, quite cool general ed program that I would also be teaching in. Rural environment, surrounded by corn and basically nothing else. Nearest anything an hour away. I would be the only person in my field at the school and could build the program. I would be in a department of 3, with the other two professors in an adjacent field. 4/4 load (which was really more like 4.5/4.5 given the gen ed). $46,000 salary. Tenure after four years and reading the guidelines made it seem that as long as I didn't burn the place down or sleep with a student, I'd get it.

I took Offer 2 and worked there for three years at which point I left for my current position, at a mid-sized public regional comprehensive closer to the area of the country of Offer 1. 4/4 load, $56,000 salary. I go up for tenure this year after delaying for having a child. I am happy here (mostly). I like the area, I like my colleagues. 

The school I worked at (Offer 2) for three years (2010-2013) is now closed. They closed in 2017. Last I heard, the school from Offer 1 has folded the department I would have worked in and I don't know what would have happened to me had I been there. My position now is stable and safe. Like just about any institution of higher ed, we will face challenges in the coming years given the coronavirus, but we are not in danger of closing our department or university. 

My advice, based solely on my experiences (N=1) is to take a good and honest look at what is important to you. If you are someone who would rather take a job at a middling liberal arts school that will close in the next decade while you try to work your way up and out than work at Target, then know that about yourself and make the jump. Also, realize that you cannot know the future so trust your gut and do what you need to do to eat and live indoors. At the end of the day, prestige is way less important that happiness and being content with your life. 

And really, there is a lot of value (at least to me) in working with students who represent the vast majority of college students in the U.S. which is to say, many of them are first generation and/or are Pell-eligible, many of them come from tough backgrounds but you know what? They are driven as hell. They are inspiring to me every day. They show the fuck up. They are not entitled. My favorite thing about my university is that we know who we are and we aren't pretending to be something we aren't. Not to give to much away, but we are just down the road from a very well known university with a national profile in the sciences. If I told you the name of that school you'd know it, but you would likely not know the school I work at. That's ok. We aren't trying to be them. We are doing the thing we do and we are doing it well. And I'm happy to be a part of it.

So that's my long winded way of saying: get the fuck over yourself and figure out what's important, like really and truly. If holding out for a TT job at Harvard is the only thing that will make you happy, well then go for that. Delay graduation, pump out those articles, go get yours. But also consider that there's wonderful work to be done down here in the trenches. At the schools that 85% of college students attend. At the places where most of us (and most of you will) work."

In case of stock picking, not always. 

There are two kinds of risk, market risk and idiosyncratic risk. Market risk, like the situation with coronavirus, is unavoidable. Stocks tend to correlate with each other a lot. Idiosyncratic is the risk of each specific company. Like, a biotech company's price being heavily influenced by FDA approval of their drug, oil producers influenced by oil prices etc, and also issues specific to the management of each individual company. 

You get more expected return for taking on more market risk (like by weighting your portfolio towards small cap companies which are riskier). You don't get any higher expected return for taking on idiosyncratic risk, since you can get rid of idiosyncratic risk for free by simply diversifying. So if you have a portfolio of a small number of stocks, you are taking on unnecessary risk for no reward."

In Jeffery Watson’s view, a Toyota Camry was moving too slow in the fast lane of West Loop 820, Fort Worth police said.

He got behind it, and the car’s 70-year-old driver hit her brakes. He drove past, and she flipped him off, he said.

Fueled by anger, Watson, 34, aimed his Glock handgun at Julia Gregor’s car, intending to shoot out her tires, he told detectives.

Jeffery Watson’s father repeatedly cried Wednesday as he tried to describe his son.

“He’s not a monster,” Joe Watson said as he fought back tears in a telephone interview with the Fort Worth Star-Telegram. “He made a stupid mistake.”

Jeffery Watson was in custody and accused of killing Gregor. The married father of two children was booked Tuesday into jail on suspicion of murder.

“He told me he shot at the tire,” Joe Watson said. “And somehow the gun went off again and it went up. He kept apologizing over and over again.”

An arrest warrant affidavit written by Detective Thomas O’Brien describes this account of Watson and Gregor’s encounter on April 1:


About 11:45 a.m., Gregor was driving along the southbound lanes of West Loop 820, near Camp Bowie West Boulevard.

Jeffery Watson was traveling in the fast lane as was Gregor, but she was driving much slower, he told police. When he got behind her, she hit her brakes.

Jeffery Watson told a detective that upset him and as he drove past Gregor, she flipped him off. He drove in front of her and slammed on his brakes, causing both vehicles to stop in the fast line of the highway, he told police.

Gregor continued to flip him off, he said, and he pulled out his gun and attempted to shoot her tires, according to the warrant affidavit. Watson shot twice at the car but said he did not know if he had hit the vehicle. He left the highway and went to his job.

Gregor’s husband of 53 years suggested in an interview with the Star-Telegram that if Watson’s account is accurate, his wife had lost her life over a trivial matter.


“All I know is if I would’ve shot everybody who’s flipped me off, there would be quite a few dead people,” Ted Gregor said. “That’s no excuse to me.”

“That’s just his story. I really don’t know,” he said.

After she was shot, Gregor’s car crashed into a guardrail in the median. She died about 4 1/2 hours later at a hospital.

Jeffery Watson told police he did not realize his round had struck her until he read a news article on the shooting.

Immediately after that, he asked his cousin to hide his handgun in an attic.

After posting information about the crime on social media on Friday, homicide detectives received an anonymous tip on Monday that led them to Jeffery Watson, police said. The next day, detectives located the weapon.

Joe Watson, who lives in Wichita, Kansas, sobbed Wednesday as he talked about how Julia Gregor’s family must be devastated.

“It’s all been a nightmare for them,” Joe Watson told the Star-Telegram.

He said he wanted to pass along his condolences to the Gregor family and that his son also was remorseful.

“He’s never done anything like this,” Joe Watson said. “He didn’t drive down that road on the intent of killing her.”

Joe Watson said his son has bipolar disorder and takes medications to treat it.

“He has anger issues,” the father said. “That night before, he had grounded his son and he didn’t get much sleep. He was frustrated that day. He shouldn’t have been driving.”

Jeffery Watson was arrested in 2003 and accused of burglary and retaliation, according to Tarrant County criminal court records. Those charges were later dismissed.

In 2008, he was arrested and faced a charge of aggravated assault with a deadly weapon in what his father said involved another road rage incident.

“In 2003, his girlfriend wouldn’t let him in their home to see his son and he kicked the door open,” Joe Watson said. “That road rage in 2008 was when the other man came at him with a knife and he (Jeff) pulled out his gun, but that charge was dropped.”

In the last few years, Jeffery Watson had straightened out his life, raising a family and working a steady job in Fort Worth, his father said.

“He had even gone to check on his elderly neighbors,” Joe Watson said, referring to the coronavirus pandemic.

Gregor had worked for about 15 years at XPO Logistics as a supervisor dealing with failed electronics, her husband said. She usually worked from 3 a.m. to 3 p.m., but left early on April 1 and headed to her Benbrook home.

“I’m just — I’m glad he’s caught. I wouldn’t want another family to go through this,” Ted Gregor said.

A chaplain called to tell him of his wife’s condition, and Ted arrived at the hospital to find Julia on life support.

“I got to hold her hand,” he said.

Then she was gone."

I believe the idea is that it was likely freely spreading around well before we did anything to contain it (for example, there was a large, as-yet-unexplained increase in influenza-like infections in the US back in January and February, but nobody was looking for coronavirus back then), and the situation deteriorated far more rapidly than was expected.

If the virus gets under control thanks to social distancing, there may be additional waves, but they’ll likely be caught sooner (due to the increase of test from...uh...no testing), kept more localized, and, for patients that are in the hospital, treatment will be easier (meaning no more sending sick patients out to spread it more).

The biggest problem seems to be asymptomatic cases. Some recent data out of China suggests that as many as 80% of cases may be asymptomatic. Ironically, a number this high could end up being a good thing: while it would make the other poster’s claim of a 60% infection rate a possibility, it would also mean the virus is much less deadly and not quite as contagious as previously expected. More importantly, it would mean many people are already immune from the disease, which would make it harder for additional waves to gain traction, and those people could resume work w/o worrying about getting or spreading it (...once we have a cheap antibody test to confirm, anyway)."

The real worry right now is the number of hospital beds, ventilators, medical personnel, etc that we're going to need to combat the worst infections. Triaging is necessary no matter what but the less we isolate, the more we overload the system, and the more people will die (whether from coronavirus or other issues that cannot be treated in a timely manner).

Sure the mortality rate seems low, but when it's ridiculously infectious, that still means a great number of people are dying.

The Juventus forward challenged his Instagram followers to a 'core crusher challenge' in Nike's Living Room Cup on Sunday. 


The name of the game: touch your toes as many times as possible while lying flat on your back. 

By the end of it, you might not have abs like Ronaldo, but the aim is to get as many people doing exercise at home during the coronavirus lockdown as possible. 

Athletics star Caster Semenya quickly beat the Portuguese's record. While he managed 142 reps in 45 seconds, the Olympic gold medallist easily surpassed him with 176.  

Footballers haven't found it so easy, however, and Manchester United's Bruno Fernandes probably regrets bringing his attempt to his compatriot's attention. 

The playmaker wrote after notching up 117 reps in the allotted 45-second time:


[""#NikeLivingRoomCup - Week One. 117 Abs in 45 seconds. Not bad for a Sunday…""](https://www.instagram.com/p/B-nUeznBV_e/?utm_source=ig_embed&ig_mid=4F9A9BB3-B3BE-49BC-8891-476DD56D5602)

It's an impressive attempt, but it clearly didn't win over Ronaldo, who replied on his own Instagram story: 

[""Train your arms instead!""](https://gmsrp.cachefly.net/images/20/04/08/a5220590cc892bd4d271d7b10c2fe82b/480.jpg)

Ouch. 

Of course, it's not the first time in recent months Fernandes' name has been mentioned in the same breath as his idol.

Having moved to Old Trafford from Sporting Lisbon to follow in the footsteps of the five-time Ballon d'Or winner, the 25-year-old has been a revelation. 

Before the season was interrupted, he had already chipped in with two goals and three assists in just five league games. 

If that's a sign of things to come, then the early comparisons with Ronaldo might be justified - even if he pales in comparison to the legend when it comes to his abs workouts."

I have been trying to figure out the same thing for a while, and I think there is an obvious answer that I really wish weren't true: many people attracted to our ways of thinking are simply contrarians. Which is to say they ended up here for emotional/psychological reasons, not intellectual reasons.

I won't accuse them of being charlatans because I believe they are perfectly genuine. But they aren't people I take seriously, because they are just guided by wanting to be the opposite of mainstream. They are right-wing political hipsters. Like hipsters it was never about the music or clothes, it was because they wanted to be different.

It's probably also why we attract so many provocateurs and genuine charlatans. It's really easy to get by on the far-right by just putting out edgy opinions and competing for relevance through absurdity."

Thank you for your input. I respectfully disagree with your statement. Along with my council, we are working on constructive solutions that are in the best interests of all involved parties. This sometimes means compromising and fighting for an unpopular solution, but at this point in time, I don't believe after everything that the administration has done and invested into the Arch program, that they're going to make it optional. That is why we are working to make this summer implementation as beneficial for students as possible.

I know it's not an easy time for people right now. I personally live in New York City, the center of the Coronavirus outbreak in the United States, so believe me when I say I understand what being an active family member and having loved ones on the front lines mean. 

Can I ask for the source on ""RPI's administration has dismissed the recent petition for an optional Arch and proven once again that they will not act in our best interests.""? I agree, there are definitely students that are pushing for an optional arch, or the complete cancellation of arch altogether. To the best of my knowledge, the student senate is addressing this petition, working hard on this and trying to propose something to the administration very soon, but let me know if I'm mistaken."

2020-04-09,rpalaces,unpopularopinion,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/unpopularopinion/comments/fwlg3m/coronavirus_mega_thread/fmvkab9/,"After reading through some of this thread, I feel like the coronavirus-related opinions on here actually aren't as unpopular as they might seem. I think there are a few things that are obscuring how widespread these views are.

First - the overall political orientation on Reddit tends to be fairly pro-lockdown. I think this generally correlates with left-leaning views, although personally I consider myself left of center overall and I'm pretty concerned about the effects of the lockdown.

Also, most of the major media outlets tend to be fairly pro-lockdown. There have been some dissenting voices but they're definitely in the minority. I think a good analogy is the 2016 election. People who primarily move in left-leaning social circles (myself included) were totally blindsided by the true number of people who supported Trump, largely because he received such uniformly negative coverage in almost every major media outlet.

I'm sure there are also issues of social pressure that make it so that people are hesitant to speak against the lockdown because they fear being attacked and harassed on social media. I'm almost certain a similar thing occurred in 2016 with Trump supporters.

So having said all that, I'm wondering how we can collectively push for change. In addition to my day job (which fortunately I still have, although I know others aren't so lucky), I'm the owner of a small commercial property. I have a restaurant tenant on the bottom floor and a couple apartments on the top floor, which I've been renting through AirBnb. Needless to say, things have not been good the last few weeks. AirBnb bookings have all but disappeared, and the restaurant has been forced to close. I have the savings to get through a couple months of this, I worked out a deal to get a small amount of rent from the restaurant, and I've been looking into aid through the CARES act, but this is still unsustainable.

In any case, I didn't mean to make this post about me. I brought up my situation to say that I've shared this info with my local elected officials in an attempt to push them to provide more clarity on when and how this lockdown will end.

From this thread alone, it looks like there are a lot of us with similar concerns. If we all reach out to our elected officials, chambers of commerce, etc, I'm optimistic that there will be enough of us to start to shift the conversation. The pro-lockdown people are certainly not remaining silent. Let's make sure to be heard as well."

https://www.weblyf.com/2020/04/covid-19-vaccines-killed-seven-children-in-senegal-africa/

I found it by searching on DuckDuckGo. From the URL it is clear that the article is talking about what you are saying.
 But you are correct, the article is not available. When I tried to open it, this message appears:

> Internal Server Error
> 
> The server encountered an internal error or misconfiguration and was unable to complete your request.

> Please contact the server administrator at webmaster@weblyf.com to inform them of the time this error occurred, and the actions you performed just before this error.

> Additionally, a 500 Internal Server Error error was encountered while trying to use an ErrorDocument to handle the request.

Not only that, but the homepage itself (https://www.weblyf.com/) gives out this error.

So either the site is down for unrelated reasons, or there was a DDOS attack bringing it down.

It's not surprising these psychopaths would want to test this in Africa. [Heck, recently a French doctor even openly said this should be done](https://www.businessinsider.com/coronavirus-vaccines-france-doctors-say-test-poor-africans-outrage-2020-4?op=1). He was condemned by the international community, but we all know things like this are going on behind the scenes and he was just saying what other similar psychopathic researchers have on their minds.

""The trade-war with China will destroy our economy!"" It didn't, and it turns out having major economic and trade entanglements with China is being proven to be a very bad idea—as is having unsecured borders in general.

I ask because a very high percentage of cats in shelters get a virus similar to our cold sore virus. It can go away for a long time and come back and flair up in times of stress. That’s a lot more likely than her catching it 2 days ago because that’s a very short incubation period. 

Generally speaking, mild flairs go away on their own in a week or two. Signs you should take her to the vet are if she stops eating, you see anything green or yellow from her eyes or nose, or the symptoms  get much worse. If the sneezing doesn’t resolve in 2 weeks I’d get her checked as well"

Politics is interesting in that people who may not be qualified for anything, can actually end up running everything. Is that really a sane approach?

My post explains the immediate math for why S&P is up.

What it doesn’t say is that I still have a bearish outlook.  I think the upside from current levels is limited, while the downside is significant.  I think it’s a bad trade-off to be 100% long right now.  I wouldn’t keep money in that I have to touch anytime soon.

For this reason, I’d rather not be fully invested right now.  I need to see further resolution of the Coronavirus problem.

And I also think the consumer pullback from this crisis will be more severe than is being estimated.

Plus, if there is any deleveraging, we’ll see more asset sales.

There are plenty of good reasons to be a bear, and the spreadsheet I presented really just says “you’re getting paid less for the same thing you owned 3 months ago”."

Wednesday was the smallest percentage increase in cases in Florida in a month. We'll see in a few days if things are near a peak in FL.

Looking at Worldometers, Florida is at 16,000 cases, which sounds bad until you account for Florida being the 3rd largest state in the nation. If you look at cases/deaths per 1 million, then there are more covid cases/deaths per 1m in Vermont than in Florida. Vermont has 968 cases per 1m, Florida has 762 cases per 1m.

Considering how much tourism goes through Florida and all the people posting pictures shaming spring breakers and beachgoers, things are going a lot better than one would suspect.

It kinda feels like some of the emphasis on Florida is more a thing of Dems trying to find some swing state with a Republican governor to bash. It was either gonna be Florida or Texas to get targeted for that 'attention'. But it turns out that Texas is faring even better than Florida. Texas has 361 cases per 1m. Maybe FL/TX are too warm for the coronavirus.

If either Florida or Texas had 5300 or 7700 cases per 1m like NJ/NY, there'd be a lot of people being critical of DeSantis or Abbott. Those same people aren't bashing Cuomo or Murphy though. One could imagine how positive the coverage would be if Andrew Gillum was Florida's Governor and Florida was faring better than the nation in dealing with covid19.

Nearly 46% of all US Coronavirus cases have happened in NY or NJ. Which is awful for them. That also means that since the major media companies are located in NYC, it's being covered like the entire country is going through the same thing as NY/NJ.

I say all this knowing that Phil Murphy probably won't let me back in New Jersey now. Considering the power of the Governor of New Jersey, he probably can declare people persona non grata too. But one day people really should take a look into how Cuomo, that idiot Bill De Blasio, and Murphy handled things."

Actually, the best ongoing proof of immunity is no infection as a result of an innoculum exposure, or presence.  

However, in about 10 or 20 years, specific antibodies (at a specified concentration level)  will be accepted. 

There has never been any prior accepted criteria for human immunity from a coronavirus, but in the long run, there will be tests for multiple different antibodies.  

Of course, one can have current antibody production and a current infection.

Social distancing on a regular day is difficult.

And during the upcoming Easter and Passover holidays, I urge everyone  to stay vigilant by staying home during the [coronavirus lockdown](https://nypost.com/coronavirus/) — and getting creative with technology.

I  know it’s a special holiday season, but this disease doesn’t care about religion or  social status or ethnicity. It wants to be in your nasal passages and respiratory tract.

Please  stay at home, not let new people into their houses to celebrate and skip religious services in person.

People may cough or sneeze, and the virus can last for up to three hours in the air. Transmission is as simple as that. To decrease it, stay home, FaceTime your family and contact your church, to find out how they are using technology for services.

“This is the ultimate definition of apart together.”

As someone who has been at the bedside when someone is dying from COVID-19 , that despair and helplessness and anguish is real and I implore you all to continue social distancing."

He died in Sri Aurobindo Hospital, where he was admitted after being diagnosed to have COVID-19. He is survived by his wife and three sons, all of whom are in Australia.

His colleague, Dr D. Natwar, said Panjwani's patients included mostly from the slum colony.

RNA viruses, or those that have RNA as their main genetic material instead of DNA, including SARS-CoV-2, mutate constantly and do not have the mechanisms to fix these ""mistakes,"" as human cells do, for example. 

But most of these mutations negatively affect the virus. If mutations are not beneficial to the virus, they are typically eliminated through natural selection, the mechanism of evolution whereby organisms better adapted to their environment tend to survive. Other mutations survive and get embedded into the ""average"" genome of a virus.

Typically, multiple genes code for traits such as a virus's severity or ability to transmit to other people, Grubaugh wrote. So, for a virus to become more severe or transmit more easily, multiple genes would have to mutate. Despite high rates of mutation among viruses in general, it's unusual to find viruses that change their mode of transmission between humans over such short time scales, he wrote

2020-04-09,Doctor_Scholls,sandiego,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/sandiego/comments/fy3soz/san_diego_landlord_to_tenants_nobody_really_has_a/fmy6m45/,"A San Diego landlord has sent an email to his tenants criticizing the idea of a rent strike and putting in blunt terms that federal and state aid mean they shouldn’t be having problems.

He wrote the email in response to letters circulating at an apartment complex about a rent strike. There is a strike already happening in San Diego, but there are other planned strikes throughout the state and nation.

Renters and tenants groups argue many of them are out of work because of COVID-19 and that landlords are afforded more protection than them, with mortgage deferments and other options.

“Nobody really has a legitimate reason not to pay rent,” wrote Jeff Miller, CEO of Pacific Living Properties, to tenants.

A renter forwarded the email to the Union-Tribune calling it “tone deaf.” Efforts to reach Pacific Living Properties for comment were unsuccessful.

In the letter, Miller says many renters have a mistaken belief that mortgages are forgiven for landlords during the crisis — not that they eventually have to pay it back.

He said the company is sympathetic to job losses because of coronavirus but that federal aid programs should mean they should not be financially burdened.

“For those that did lose jobs the CARES Act was put in place by the Federal Government to enhance unemployment, to minimize the impact, and help you pay your obligations and necessities,” he wrote.

The San Diego Tenants Union, which is organizing the local rent strike, said the letter was insulting and an example of greed.

“What is it with landlords that fail to account for the fact that if tenants don’t pay rent they end up homeless?” said Rafael Bautista of the Tenants Union. “If landlords don’t pay the mortgage, they can defer. It’s not the same outcome.”

The union argues that many have yet to receive benefits and some renters simply have no choice but to not pay rent.

Pacific Living Properties, based in San Diego, owns or manages apartment complexes in Montana, Washington, and throughout California.

The letter seemed to have struck a nerve outside of just San Diego, with renters in Los Angeles and Washington complaining about it on Twitter and Facebook.

Pacific Living’s complexes in San Diego include Aztec Lofts, Aztec Pacific, Catalina Pacific, Elivia, Golden Pacific, Mission Pacific, Pacific Sands, Pelican Point, Talmadge Point and The Pacific at Mission Bay.

The average rent at the complexes exceeds the $1,200 check that will eventually be sent to most Americans as part of the CARES Act. At Aztec Lofts, where the tenant who sent the Union-Tribune the email lives, the average rent is $1,620 a month, said real estate tracker CoStar.

Other landlords have taken a more sympathetic approach, offering payment programs or, in a small number of cases, forgiving rent for a month.

The San Diego-based Southern California Rental Housing Association did not comment directly on the Pacific Living Properties email but has advised landlords to reach out to tenants and work with them to make payments.

It even sent out a sample letter it could send to residents that doesn’t say anything about forgiving rent but talks about working in good faith together.

Miller’s letter did say it would work with residents on a deferment plan, but the letter went beyond that. He wrote that Pacific Living Properties and renters must stick together as a community.

Miller included a quote from what he said came from President John F. Kennedy (although it is a contested quote usually attributed to his brother or other politicians): “If not us, who? If not now, when?”

On Thursday, Invitation Homes CEO Dallas Tanner spoke with CNBC about how it is working with deferment plans with tenants. He said it was prepared because it has done similar programs throughout the years during natural disasters, such as California wildfires.

Invitation Homes has around 80,000 rental homes, mainly single-family, and Tanner said landlords have to strike the right balance in coming weeks and months.

“We have to help folks and we need to make sure we are helping residents in a time of need,” he said. “At the same time, we need to be careful. If we put too much pressure on landlords — we have obligations as well, such as credit facilities, property taxes, Mello-Roos, that we pay back into the system.”

He said his company has submitted a proposal to the federal government to help tenants with various options, such as a short-term, interest-free loan for rent.

Rent strike movements are continuing across the nation and many are planning to begin in May. Some of the organizations gathering signatures are Rent Strike 2020 and the Alliance of Californians for Community Empowerment, or ACCE."

How big it is depends on a whole lot of factors, including information we don't know about this virus yet. However, the TL;DR version is that there is a very small chance of you getting infected if you are walking outside and practicing social distancing.

Generally speaking, the larger water droplets (expelled from the body via talking or sneezing) that we know can/do carry the virus fall to the ground usually within a few feet (generally speaking, up to 2m, thus the 6ft social distancing rule we have, but obviously a strong sneeze can send them pretty far). They are heavy compared to the air and fall pretty quickly. Even with wind, they aren't going to travel very far. But in addition to those larger droplets, we expel bazillions of little tiny ones. We do not know how many of those are large enough to carry the virus, particularly at a substantial enough load of the virus that it would survive to infect you. We do know that those smaller droplets can last in the air for an extended period of time after being expelled because they are so light.

**However** because those droplets are super tiny and super light, the slightest wind carries them away and only a very small amount of the virus could potentially exist in them. The current general consensus appears to be that there isn't a huge concern about those tiny droplets. There have been some incidents and studies that at least have caused concern that the virus may be able to be carried via those tiny droplets, but the vast majority of data so far suggests that if it *can* be transmitted that way, it requires very specific conditions to be able to do so and is not common. When you hear people talking about a virus being ""airborne"" that is usually what they are talking about. Covid-19 is not generally considered to be airborne because it requires relatively large droplets to infect you, and those droplets can't stay in the air very long, but that doesn't mean that it can **never** happen if the circumstances are right.

That means that, while his campaign is still legally and technically a thing, Bernie is no longer actively pursuing the nomination.  He won't be buying ads to get people to vote for him, he won't be debating Biden, he won't be having volunteers canvass neighborhoods, he won't be holding rallies, or doing any of the other things a candidate does to try and win an election.  

That said, it does not remove him from the ballot or prevent people from voting for him.  It is technically possible (albeit EXTREMELY unlikely) that Bernie supporters could continue to hit the polls *en masse* and end up outvoting the Biden supporters.  That could still, technically, lead to a situation where Bernie wins the nomination.  

That said, this is virtually impossible.  Any candidate has to move heaven and earth to try to get their supporters to even show up on election day, and with a suspended campaign it's unlikely anybody will show up anyway.  

Right now the only scenario I see that ends with a Bernie win is if Biden gets coronavirus so badly that he has to withdraw from the race entirely (IE, the virus either kills him or causes permanent damage to his body that would prevent him from becoming President).  If that happened, Bernie would still face a battle against the DNC establishment, who would likely try to support one of the other, more moderate candidates.  But he would have a decent shot as the second most voted for candidate.  
If that happened he could resume his campaign and with the right message could probably attract a lot of support due to COVID-19 and his policies that favor strong safety nets and universal health care."

However, it would be my guess that the defense would argue that the ""attack"" was meant to remove Ms. Marshall (86) from Ms. Lundy's (32) space and avoid infection risk, not directly as a means to cause harm to Ms. Marshall.  It is hard to prove motivation here, especially in times as stressful and terrifying as these.  Additionally, the current situation makes panic regarding infection a very defensible position, as pretty much any jury you could find today might be able to understand a ""coronavirus panic"" defense, especially if the defense did a good job arguing it.  An ""involuntary manslaughter"" charge is probably the prosecution preempting this defense by setting a lower standard for conviction for the defendant.

I am not a lawyer, a paralegal, a law student, or anything close to a lawyer.  I have a decent amount of experience in E.R.s, though, and, knowing the stresses many patients are under even without a pandemic raging, I would personally be open to believing that Ms. Lundy did not exactly INTEND harm, even though she SHOULD have anticipated causing harm to the elderly woman in front of her.  This doesn't mean no crime was committed - I personally believe that this situation is well described by ""involuntary manslaughter"", and that pushing for higher charges would probably be a bad strategy for the prosecution if they want to ensure justice for Ms. Marshall's senseless death."

* there are really few infectious diseases that can spread all over the globe at the same time: it doesn't exist.
* it's not true \[...\] that we can have one disease case in one country, and then pchhht! it invades the whole earth. it's all nonsense/rubbish.

Same story for friends with symptoms and neg flu tests (or flu shots). I have a feeling it ran through here, or at least a variant, in January and just got attributed to a flu resurgence, even when people tested neg for the flu or weren’t tested at all.

2020-04-09,goodbyekawaii,Coronavirus,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/fy1e4b/this_hospital_was_built_for_a_pandemic_chicagos/fmxt24x/,"Without paywall 2:


Located along the Interstate 290 expressway and just west of Chicago’s downtown lakefront, Rush is an academic health system that includes the main medical center, plus four other locations in the city and nearby suburbs. Funding for the Tower came from private grants, contributions and federal agencies, including the Energy Department and the Defense Department.

On a recent morning, the atrium is empty. Non-coronavirus patients are staying home, despite their injuries, afraid they’ll become infected at the hospital, Purim-Shem-Tov said. A typical Monday at Rush might bring 240 people to the emergency room. Now that number is about 155, she said.

But the ER is sending an increasing number of patients to intensive care. Typically, 2 percent of ER patients are transferred to the intensive care unit. Last week, that rose to 10 percent, Purim-Shem-Tov said. The most patients admitted to the ICU in a single day so far has been 21, said ICU Medical Director Mark Yoder.

Capacity in the ICU is becoming a challenge as patients are not recovering quickly and are staying longer. Rush has already filled its ICU floor, plus another floor outfitted for ICU patients. On Saturday, it started sending ICU patients to a third floor. The Tower’s total critical-care bed capacity on the top five floors is 304.

The volume has stressed nurses who have had to forgo frequently turning patients, checking blood sugar levels and examining chart notes, Yoder said. They “can’t operate at [the] high level” they are used to, he said. Monitors and supplies are kept in the hallways so nurses don’t have to go in and out of the rooms as frequently. “Precautions” needed to interact with coronavirus patients, Yoder said, “take a longer time.”

‘We are using everything that we have’

If Rush and Chicago’s other five major hospital systems reach capacity, they can send overflow patients to a 3,000-bed field hospital just built by the Army Corps of Engineers inside Chicago’s McCormick Place convention center. Staffing will come from qualified personnel pulled from the suburbs and the surrounding area. Five hundred beds became available last week; the rest will open by the end of April. At that point, the makeshift facility will be one of the largest of its kind in the United States, the state says. The city also signed agreements with downtown hotels to house nurses and doctors working with covid-19 patients if they fear infecting their families.

So far, officials consider this the calm before the surge. Not one Illinois hospital has reached capacity, which makes the state’s greatest struggle so far with the federal government. Chicago and the state are pulling supplies from the state’s stockpile while Gov. J.B. Pritzker (D) has been sharply critical of the Trump administration, charging that it has denied needed supplies to his state. He said he asked for N95 masks but received surgical masks, and he requested 4,000 ventilators but got just 450. Pritzker told CNN that Vice President Pence told him Illinois needed only 1,400 ventilators.

Pritzker said Illinois is particularly vulnerable because it borders Iowa, which has no stay-at-home order, and Missouri, which only recently imposed one — a situation Pritzker attributed to a rise of cases in southern Illinois near St. Louis.

President Trump has attacked Pritzker, saying “he’s always complaining.”

In an interview with The Washington Post on Saturday, Allison Arwady, Chicago’s public health commissioner, said the local stockpile was designed “to serve Chicago and then be supplemented” by the federal stockpile.

According to state data, 1,198 ventilators from the city’s stockpile are in use, and 57 percent are still available. But with about 25 percent of coronavirus patients on ventilators, the need for more is becoming urgent, she said. To date, her office has already pulled ventilators from local zoos, veterinary hospitals and surgical outpatient centers.

“We are using everything that we have,” she said. “But when we look at our models, we need more.

“We anticipate we are going to need more even in the best-case scenario than we have right now. I spend a lot of time trying to convey that sense of urgency to the federal government,” she said.

“We took our part really seriously locally. We really need this, and we need it soon.”

In a glass-walled boardroom in Rush’s professional building, the system’s top doctors and department heads gather at 9 a.m. on a recent morning to comb through the daily numbers on giant overhead screens. The data tracks covid-19’s journey as it moves through the city, the state, the United States and the world.

They discuss how medical staff members can protect themselves, profiles of certain patients, how Illinois compares with other hot spots around the United States, particularly New York and California. The internal briefings, which take place twice a day, are intended to expedite decision-making, but they are also helping Rush prepare for the inevitable surge in Illinois, which Pritzker said is likely to happen later this month.

If Chicago’s stay-at-home order is lifted in May, many worry that residents — eager to get outside in the warm weather — will congregate too fast and too closely, triggering a second outbreak.

Meanwhile, the hallways of the ICU buzz as medical staff, most working five-day, 12-hour shifts, show no visible signs of fatigue, although Betty Tran, a critical-care physician, admits the pace is difficult to sustain.

“I have a 3-year-old, so a 12-hour shift means it’s tough to see her before or after bedtime,” Tran said.

Omar Lateef, Rush’s chief executive, acknowledges the advantage his hospital has over many others because of its design. But he said the greatest resources at Rush are the men and women in the building.

“What really defines your response isn’t so much a building or number of beds you have or supplies you have, it is the staff and the culture of institution,” he said. “What we found is our staff is not only willing to work, they are volunteering. We have a tremendous list of people trying to get in and help. From the security to the front-door staff to the ICU, there’s not a member of our team not willing to stand up.”"

But I have my good days and I have my bad days. I want to explain why I think the HUGE SPY 5/15 240 put position I entered today is probably going to fall. So this is a bull case from a reluctant bear.

Even before the coronavirus shit popped off, everyone knew that the good times were going to come to end. Usually the idea was that JPow was going to end QE and repo operation. If the Fed stopped or even signaled an end to QE and Repo, trust me, before corona, it would've sucked this market dry and presented a huge liquidity issue that would've done terrible thing. Here comes corona and fucks everything. This meant that it was a ***liquidity crunch that defined the March equities sell-off and three different days of circuit breakers.*** The issue is that I think current bears think that corona on it's own will produce the same set of conditions for another drop, but it won't. The liquidity problem has been solved by the FED, or at least temporarily. That means the corona bear case needs another catalyst or de-stabilizer, which it got in the form of Russia backing out of the OPEC deal back in March which sent the markets into circuit breaker mode on that next Monday.

If the liquidity crisis has been solved, which make no mistake was one of the biggest macro issue facing the economy before corona hit, if that problem is solved with JPOW and BRRRR, then corona needs another catalyst. Clearly the recession thesis has, at least, temporarily been debunked, despite whatever TA u/Variation-Separate and [u/scarvesandsuspenders](https://www.reddit.com/user/scarvesandsuspenders/) throw out there. I think the market really thinks that this is a temporary stoppage of an economy that just got thrown trillions of dollars at it.

You won't have a steep downward trend because people aren't scared of a recession anymore, so greed has entered the question. People think this is the bottom. They buy in. If the rug is going to get pulled it need *something* besides just corona. I don't care what the TA says but, to be frank, and I love V-S, he has been wrong for 2 weeks now (at least with his timing). TA is not serious or real enough, though certainly helpful, to predicate the direction of the market, especially in the special circumstances we are in right now.

5/15 240p SPY. But that is based on gut, and a sense that smart people don't believe this rally. Plus WSB has turned bullish which means time to turn bearish. Hook, line, and sinker."

Tips For Social Distancing, Quarantine, And Isolation During An Infectious Disease Outbreak

What Is Social Distancing?

Social distancing is a way to keep people from interacting closely or frequently enough to spread an infectious disease. Schools and other gathering places such as movie theaters may close, and sports events and religious services may be cancelled.

What Is Quarantine?

Quarantine separates and restricts the movement of people who have been exposed to a contagious disease to see if they become sick. It lasts long enough to ensure the person has not contracted an infectious disease.

What Is Isolation?

Isolation prevents the spread of an infectious disease by separating people who are sick from those who are not. It lasts as long as the disease is contagious.

What To Expect: Typical Reactions

Everyone reacts differently to stressful situations such as an infectious disease outbreak that requires social distancing, quarantine, or isolation. People may feel:

•	⁠Anxiety, worry, or fear related to:
•	⁠Your own health status
•	⁠The health status of others whom you may have exposed to the disease
•	⁠The resentment that your friends and family may feel if they need to go into quarantine as a result of contact with you
•	⁠The experience of monitoring yourself, or being monitored by others for signs and symptoms of the disease
•	⁠Time taken off from work and the potential loss of income and job security
•	⁠The challenges of securing things you need, such as groceries and personal care items
•	⁠Concern about being able to effectively care for children or others in your care
•	⁠Uncertainty or frustration about how long you will need to remain in this situation, and uncertainty about the future
•	⁠Loneliness associated with feeling cut off from the world and from loved ones
•	⁠Anger if you think you were exposed to the disease because of others’ negligence
•	⁠Boredom and frustration because you may not be able to work or engage in regular day-to-day activities
•	⁠Uncertainty or ambivalence about the situation
•	⁠A desire to use alcohol or drugs to cope
•	⁠Symptoms of depression, such as feelings of hopelessness, changes in appetite, or sleeping too little or too much
•	⁠Symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), such as intrusive distressing memories, flashbacks (reliving the event), nightmares, changes in thoughts and mood, and being easily startled.

Ways To Support Yourself During Social Distancing, Quarantine, and Isolation

UNDERSTAND THE RISK

Consider the real risk of harm to yourself and others around you. The public perception of risk during a situation such as an infectious disease outbreak is often inaccurate. Media coverage may create the impression that people are in immediate danger when really the risk for infection may be very low. Take steps to get the facts:

•	⁠Stay up to date on what is happening, while limiting your media exposure. Avoid watching or listening to news reports 24/7 since this tends to increase anxiety and worry. Remember that children are especially affected by what they hear and see on television.
•	⁠Look to credible sources for information on the infectious disease outbreak.

BE YOUR OWN ADVOCATE

Speaking out about your needs is particularly important if you are in quarantine, since you may not be in a hospital or other facility where your basic needs are met. Ensure you have what you need to feel safe, secure, and comfortable.

•	⁠Work with local, state, or national health officials to find out how you can arrange for groceries and toiletries to be delivered to your home as needed.
•	⁠Inform health care providers or health authorities of any needed medications and work with them to ensure that you continue to receive those medications.

EDUCATE YOURSELF

Health care providers and health authorities should provide information on the disease, its diagnosis, and treatment.

•	⁠Do not be afraid to ask questions—clear communication with a health care provider may help reduce any distress associated with social distancing, quarantine, or isolation.
•	⁠Ask for written information when available.
•	⁠Ask a family member or friend to obtain information in the event that you are unable to secure this information on your own.

WORK WITH YOUR EMPLOYER TO REDUCE FINANCIAL STRESS

If you’re unable to work during this time, you may experience stress related to your job status or financial situation.

•	⁠Provide your employer with a clear explanation of why you are away from work.
•	⁠Contact the U.S. Department of Labor tollfree at 1-866-487-2365 about the Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA), which allows U.S. employees up to 12 weeks of unpaid leave for serious medical conditions, or to care for a family member with a serious medical condition.
•	⁠Contact your utility providers, cable and Internet provider, and other companies from whom you get monthly bills to explain your situation and request alternative bill payment arrangements as needed.

CONNECT WITH OTHERS

Reaching out to people you trust is one of the best ways to reduce anxiety, depression, loneliness, and boredom during social distancing, quarantine, and isolation. You can:

•	⁠Use the telephone, email, text messaging, and social media to connect with friends, family, and others.
•	⁠Talk “face to face” with friends and loved ones using Skype or FaceTime.
•	⁠If approved by health authorities and your health care providers, arrange for your friends and loved ones to bring you newspapers, movies, and books.
•	⁠Sign up for emergency alerts via text or email to ensure you get updates as soon as they are available.
•	⁠Call SAMHSA’s free 24-hour Disaster Distress Helpline at 1-800-985-5990, if you feel lonely or need support.
•	⁠Use the Internet, radio, and television to keep up with local, national, and world events.
•	⁠If you need to connect with someone because of an ongoing alcohol or drug problem, consider calling your local Alcoholics Anonymous or Narcotics Anonymous offices.

TALK TO YOUR DOCTOR

If you are in a medical facility, you may have access to health care providers who can answer your questions. However, if you are quarantined at home, and you’re worried about physical symptoms you or your loved ones may be experiencing, call your doctor or other health care provider:

•	⁠Ask your provider whether it would be possible to schedule remote appointments via Skype or FaceTime for mental health, substance use, or physical health needs.

USE PRACTICAL WAYS TO COPE AND RELAX

•	⁠Relax your body often by doing things that work for you-take deep breaths, stretch, meditate or pray, or engage in activities you enjoy.
•	⁠Pace yourself between stressful activities, and do something fun after a hard task.
•	⁠Talk about your experiences and feelings to loved ones and friends, if you find it helpful.
•	⁠Maintain a sense of hope and positive thinking; consider keeping a journal where you write down things you are grateful for or that are going well

There are indications that Sweden is experiencing a higher death toll than its neighbors. While the Scandinavian countries reported their first fatalities at roughly the same time, Sweden as of April 8 had 687 fatalities, Denmark 218 and Norway 93. In per capita terms, Sweden is faring clearly worse than Norway and increasingly worse than Denmark.
> 
> In particular, Sweden seems to have failed to protect its most vulnerable citizens, in part by relying on speculative cultural theories. Authorities have argued that Swedes socialize less across generations than southern Europeans, and that Sweden could let the elderly self-isolate while merely slowing the spread of the virus among the rest of the population until so-called herd immunity is attained. (Although herd immunity is not the official strategy, some officials maintain that there is no other conceivable way to stop the epidemic, praising the original British strategy that the United Kingdom later backed away from.)
>
> But it was never clear how this risky strategy of isolating the elderly while others got infected would work in practice. American economist Tyler Cowen sarcastically asked whether the plan for senior citizens is “encasing them in bubble wrap, or something.”
>
> There are now alarming reports that the virus has spread to one-third of nursing homes in Stockholm, which has resulted in rising fatalities. While it is true that Swedes rarely live with their parents, older citizens are hardly isolated: The Scandinavian model simply outsources care from families to caretakers who visit dozens of clients every week. Caretakers are rarely tested for the virus but have simply been urged to stay at home if and shortly after experiencing symptoms.
> 
> Nor is there much indication that the Swedish economy is weathering the storm better than comparable countries. The drop in the stock market and the rise in unemployment are roughly in line with other advanced economies.
> 
> In the past few weeks, the country has experienced a bizarre nationalistic wave dubbed “public health nationalism” (”folkhälsonationalism”), which celebrates Sweden as an island of common sense in a sea of panic and resistance to science. According to this narrative promulgated by authorities and media alike, cultural exceptionalism — such as high public trust –– makes Sweden particularly well-equipped to manage the pandemic. When asked why Sweden’s strategy deviates from other countries’, Sweden’s influential former state epidemiologist Johan Giesecke quipped, “That is because everyone else is doing it wrong.” He went on to explain how he could be so confident: ”I think we will manage the epidemic without destroying the economy more than necessary. The absolutely most important thing is to protect the elderly from getting infected. I think we succeed quite well in that. It lies in the Swedish national character to do as one is told.”
> 
> The public has been assured that Sweden will outperform other countries. Indeed, Sweden ranks among the lowest of 26 surveyed countries when it comes to fear of the coronavirus in a recent YouGov poll –– even though the country ranks fifth-highest in per capita deaths of the countries surveyed.

>Professor Ferrari subsequently resigned on 7 April 2020. Therefore, his resignation in fact followed a written unanimous vote of no confidence. In contrast, Professor Ferrari has stated that the reason for his resignation is that the Scientific Council did not support his call for the ERC to fund a special initiative focused on the COVID-19 virus. To address this point specifically, we did not support a special initiative because that is not our remit and the Commission's Research and Innovation Directorate General, with which we are connected, was already [very active in developing new programmes](http://ec.europa.eu/info/research-and-innovation/research-area/health-research-and-innovation/coronavirus-research-and-innovation_en) to support this research through the appropriate channels.
>
>Indeed, many ERC funded researchers have been active for some time in researching the coronavirus family and many other equally dangerous pathogens. Over 50 ongoing or completed [ERC projects](https://erc.europa.eu/list-erc-funded-research-projects-related-coronavirus) supported for a total value of about EUR 100 million are contributing to the response to the COVID-19 pandemic by providing insights from several different scientific fields such as: virology, epidemiology, immunology, paths for new diagnostics and treatments, public health, medical devices, artificial intelligence, social behaviour, crisis management.
>
>In addition, as stated on its website in [reaction to the COVID-19 crisis](https://erc.europa.eu/news/coronavirus-business-continuity-measures-erc), the ERC offers ‘grantees the flexibility to adjust their research project”. This is an efficient measure because several ERC grantees already enquired about the possibility of addressing COVID-19 related research in their ongoing ERC project. All this information is publicly available on the ERC website[,](https://erc.europa.eu/list-erc-funded-research-projects-related-coronavirus) which also includes [testimonies](https://erc.europa.eu/news-events/magazine/frontier-research-service-coronavirus-epidemic-response) from funded ERC grantees on how bottom-up frontier research is critical to deliver new – and sometimes unexpected – insights relevant for better understanding and fighting the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as for providing social behaviour and crisis management related solutions.
>
>However, the ERC does not make calls for specific topics, since a guiding principle of ERC is that our researchers are free to pursue the goals they define and to decide on what they wish to work. In our view, this is a crucial way to generate the best science.
>
>The Scientific Council wishes to clarify, in case of any doubt, that they absolutely endorse the view that scientific research will provide the best solutions to tackling pandemics, such as COVID-19.
>
>Therefore, we regret Professor Ferrari's statement, which at best is economical with the truth. This Scientific Council remains dedicated to pursuing the mission for which the ERC was established: the support of bottom-up ground-breaking research.

They're already doing what he tried to get them to do, but more efficiently and in the way they're supposed to."

The degree of immunity could also differ from person to person depending on the strength of the patient’s antibody response. Younger, healthier people will likely generate a more robust antibody response, giving them more protection against the virus in future.”

You can read more on the largely ignored, but massive, European response [here](https://ec.europa.eu/info/live-work-travel-eu/health/coronavirus-response/overview-commissions-response_en). An example is the 870 billion euro Pandemic Emergency Purchase Programe from the ECB. Who do you think help finance that? China?

In regards to EU contribution, I'm talking about [net contribution per capita](https://i.imgur.com/c15qvOk.png) where the Netherlands gives more than anyone else. This is what matters. You're not contributing less just because you have built a good economy.

You have a point about the tax haven, but most Dutch seem to agree on it which is why they're disbanding it. However, as has been explained plenty of times in this forum it is pretty insignificant compared to, for instance, tax avoidance in Italy, the cost of their previous years of overspending and low retirement ages or the aid packages we're talking about. It's small fries.

When it comes to ""getting something in return"", of course we all get something in return for being part of the single market, but that's like saying I get a pizza in return for paying 1.000 euro to the local restaurant instead of 10. What do you get for paying the 900 more (edit: I have failed my old math teacher)? But I wasn't actually talking about material gains. I'm fine with Denmark paying a larger portion and I'm sure the Dutch are too. My point was about the hate and demonization they got in return as compared to all the appreciation for countries who have given far less help.

>*What's the point of helping when it's too late, when hospitals already collapsed, when the economy failed already? Is that even considered help?*

The help you're talking about here is being worked on and a lot of it has already been delivered, but it is NOT the discussion in regards to corona bonds. That is about re-investing in the economy *after* it has been hurt. There's no point in buying, for instance, new machinery right now if it just stands still.

>*If they won't get any help from those who are supposed to be their allies, don't get surprised when they'll turn to those countries who never were supposed to be their allies at all.*

Italy and Spain turned to the Belt & Road initiative long before the corona-virus even happened. Regardless, I have already shown there is a massive effort to help Italy and Spain that utterly dwarfs other countries' contribution and this is given from countries facing their own economic crisis and mass-unemployment. Yet, you show them nothing but contempt. This is not the behavior of an ally."

Ok. I appreciate the optimism you're expressing here. Keep in mind that what you're seeing reported isn't intended to be used to understand individual outcomes on the way you've extrapolated the conclusion you've come to. Yes, relatively high levels of physical fitness do correlate with greater resilience at times however the correlation you're perceiving may not apply to you or anyone you know.

You believe a healthier US will be ushered in through the efforts of individuals?

>I'm not sure your current situation. I honestly don't think it matters.

I'm not sure of your current situation. I honestly do think it matters *greatly*, likely more than you or I or Bob will ever truly realize. This is not because you lack Intelligence or you perceive things inaccurately, rather it's because there's a lot going on around you all of the time that you're simply unaware of, I'm not singling you out here. You're nowhere near unique in this as, in my opinion, nobody living could be reasonably expected to take in and actively process all of the information being presented to us through our sense experiences, much less that information combined with the information inaccessible to us through sensory experience yet existent nonetheless.

>Every one of us should be pushing to be better and use this as a means of motivation.

The normative statement you're making here isn't universally applicable and isn't indicative of a thorough understanding of human performance, most especially when it comes to exercise and fitness.

>We are facing a worldwide crisis and people are stepping up everywhere to take care of it. 

Yet life still goes on as it has since we've first experienced it within our minds, subjectively. We are facing a crisis, people are stepping up to help each other take care of it. Not subscribing to your view regarding ""pushing to be better"" or using the current situation as ""a means of motivation"" isn't synonymous with detracting from the fact that there's a crisis and that people are stepping up to help bring about a resolution.

>Maybe we can take a second to take care of ourselves as well.

I guess the whole point of me rambling to you about my thoughts on your post is simply to let you know that it's ok to be ok with you as you are while also striving to attain your goals. There's no need to employ cognitive distortions to bring your behaviors in line with what you believe will bring you closer to attaining your goals, just don't give up on you and you'll eventually find a way to make things work while stressing yourself out a hell of a lot less.

Who knows, you may even find yourself enjoying the journeys you're undertaking to pursue the future you believe you want to exist within so much that you forget all about your imagined eventualities.

Much love, stay safe out there."

NEW YORK (Reuters) - New York City officials have hired contract laborers to bury the dead in its potter’s field on Hart Island as the city’s daily death rate from the coronavirus epidemic has reached grim new records in each of the last three days.

Drone pictures show bodies being buried on New York's Hart Island where the department of corrections is dealing with more burials overall, amid the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak in New York City, U.S., April 9, 2020. REUTERS/Lucas Jackson

The city has used Hart Island to bury New Yorkers with no known next of kin or whose family are unable to arrange a funeral since the 19th century.

Typically, some 25 bodies are interred each week by low-paid jail inmates working on the island, which sits off the east shore of the city’s Bronx borough and is accessible only by boat. That number began increasing in March as the new coronavirus spread rapidly, making New York the epicenter of the global pandemic.

There are about two dozen bodies a day, five days a week buried on the island, said Jason Kersten, a spokesman for the Department of Correction, which oversees the burials.

Before burial, the dead are wrapped in body bags and placed inside pine caskets. The deceased’s name is scrawled in large letters on each casket, which helps should a body need to be disinterred later. They are buried in long narrow trenches excavated by digging machines.

“They added two new trenches in case we need them,” Kersten said. To help with the surge, and amid an outbreak of the COVID-19 respiratory illness caused by the virus at the city’s main jail, contract laborers have been hired, he said.

“For social distancing and safety reasons, city-sentenced people in custody are not assisting in burials for the duration of the pandemic,” Kersten said.

A barge could be seen arriving at the island on Thursday morning with a refrigerated truck aboard containing about two dozen bodies.

The department referred questions about causes of death to the city’s Office of the Chief Medical Examiner (OCME). Aja Worthy-Davis, a spokeswoman, said it would take time to collate individual causes of death from the office’s records, but it was probable some of the recent burials include those felled by the coronavirus.

The island may also be used as a site for temporary interments should deaths surge past the city’s morgue capacity, a point that has not yet been reached, Kersten and Worthy-Davis said.

“We’re all hoping it’s not coming to this,” Kersten said. “At the same time, we’re prepared if it does.”

OCME can store about 800 to 900 bodies in its buildings, and has room to store about 4,000 bodies in some 40 refrigerated trucks it can dispatch around the city to hospitals, which typically have only small morgues, Worthy-Davis said.

Another island to the south of Hart, Randall’s Island in the East River, is being used as a parking depot for dozens of empty refrigerated trucks between deployments outside city hospitals.

On Thursday, two trucks containing bodies that had been parked outside a hospital were temporarily moved back to the island depot, in a stadium parking lot, to make way for a delivery of oxygen and other supplies at the hospital.

“They will not stay there,” Avery Cohen, a City Hall spokeswoman, wrote in an email.

City health officials could be seen on Thursday transferring bodies from the two trucks into three hearses dispatched by funeral homes."

Even Moldbug, this sub's inspiration, advises a [harsher, not milder response](https://medium.com/@curtis.yarvin/plan-a-for-the-coronavirus-7db3997490c1) to the pandemic. 

Admittedly, I skimmed OP's article without reading it in depth. It sounds like the issue essentially boils down to the fact that a) individual doctors have some discretion when identifying cause of death, and b) the CDC recommends identifying COVID-19 when it can be ""assumed"" to have caused the death.

Obviously, I don't know what they mean by ""assumed"" there, but I don't think the article's author does either. Is it more likely that the CDC is recommending doctors write down COVID-19 *regardless of all other observable factors* or that they recommend doing so when the person demonstrably had COVID-19, was hospitalized for a severe case of it, and subsequently died relatively soon after hospitalization? 

My money is on the latter. I fail to see what benefit the ""Cathedral"" gets from scaring people into self-isolation, massively downshifting the economy with the potential for a major recession, and opening themselves up to pretty easy exposure when and if independent researchers determine the virus was much ado about nothing."
