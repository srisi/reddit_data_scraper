For vaccines will you be able to adjust the health status for those that would be recommended for their lifestyle/area? For example not all US states recommend Lepto or Coronavirus vaccines. So they wouldnâ€™t really account to the health status for some dogs, unless they often travel to different states (especially where diseases are prevalent). Another example of that would be the Bordetella vaccine, not a core vaccine and usually only highly recommended for those that do boarding, grooming, daycare, dog parks, etc."

* There are a large number of cases (n=44 last I read) with a common geographic exposure history (unsure if most or all--again the info being reported is not very helpful) and absence of human-to-human transmission (i.e. not spreading illness to other people; honestly it's way too early to conclude there was/will not (be) transmission recognized later)
* Local health authorities are making a presumptive diagnosis of viral pneumonia based on clinical symptoms (respiratory distress, fever) and response to treatment
* They have supposedly ruled out several viruses as potential causes (e.g. influenza A virus, coronavirus) but have not communicated any data regarding the testing methods used or complete list of pathogens included in their screening.

Personally, I'm surprised they aren't at least considering chemical pneumonia based on the information we have currently (e.g. exposure of market goers/workers to toxic gas/fumes with only a portion subsequently developing clinical pneumonia). This is just one alternative hypothesis, and they may indeed be dealing with a virus. However, the health authorities have not communicated important epidemiologic and diagnostic information crucial to narrowing down potential causes."
