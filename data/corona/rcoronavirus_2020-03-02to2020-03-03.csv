When that estimate came that we have 1500 cases likely, with 6 weeks from the initial infection.. . You anticipate no more than a handful the first couple weeks, then maybe 100 on week 3, moving up to 1600 by week 6.

We're only seeing the Week 3 people right now in terms of medical complications... but we should start seeing the hospitalizations and deaths anytime now. **(and what do you know, now we are)**

China locked down and quarantined a huge percentage of its population.  Of course the spread stopped, and that's great.  But it's not like the virus is gone - it's still out in the environment, and there are plenty of infected people.  Once they terminate their lockdown and the people re-emerge (and I guess they're doing that), then wouldn't the number of cases start to climb again?

There's no cure.  There's no vaccine.  The virus hasn't mutated significantly.  Nothing has changed.  Once you release the non-infected people back into circulation with the infected ones, doesn't it just blow up again?"

1/ Pence speaks: White house meets daily w/ head of VA and head of Medicare/Cedicaid

2/ 43 domestic cases, 48 returning cases. 29 out of 43 are from CA/WA state. Expert says there may be clusters.

3/ 4 fatalities today, 6 Americans fatalities total

4/ Risk of coronavirus to American people remains 'low' according to all people

5/ President says we are ready for everything. President's effort to bring the best minds and leadership at every level.

6/ Meeting with governors from 50 states and territories occured this morning. President sends gratitude to states who have repatriated. 'Seamless' relationship between state and federal government.

7/ Met today with pharmaceutical companies. Trump spoke about vaccine and therapeutics. Vaccine going into clinical trials within the next 6 weeks, but won't be available until late this year, early next year. Therapeutics might be available this summer or early fall. Pharmaceutical companies have worked together to form a consortium.

8/ Implementing travel advisories from SK and Italy. Implementing screening for 100% within 24 hours for all flights from South Korea and Itality.

9/ President has directed us to bring the best minds and leaders.

10/ Deborah Birx, ambassador at large, will be Pence's right hand (wo)man. Birx has served as scientist, physician combating HIV/AIDS with 3 decades of public health experience, interagency coordination.

11/ Birx speaks: she arrived from South Africa. She got computer and phone in 'record time', ie showing efficiency. Praising Trump about speed and efficiency of response.

12/ Azar speaks: Azar is fluffing Birx. Empty talk about productive relationships and efficiency.

13/ 43 'confirmed' or 'presumptive' cases. 17 out of 43 are travel related. 26 are from 'person to person' spread. Praises Pence's strong leadership. Immediate risk has been and continues to be low.

14/ Degree of risk has potential to change. Could become pandemic. Community spread may occur in the United States.

15/ May use 'mitigation efforts' learned from Singapore and Hong Kong, closing schools, online classes.

16/ Medicare/Medicaid services is important, blah blah old people. Seema Verma is speaking fluff about Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services roles.

17/ Working with CDC to update healthcare deadlines. Trying to figure out the types of services Medicare/Medicaid will pay for.

18/ Anthony Fauci from NIAID speaks: praising Trump and pharmaceutical CEOs. Praising Birx.

19/ Robert Redfield from CDC: Working with public health partners to identify new cases. Confirm cases, isolate, do contact tracing, limit spread of virus. Despite seeing new community cases, the risk to the American people is low.

20/ QnA time. /end"

One explanation could be that only now a critical point has been reached. The first weeks could just have been single digit new cases each week. Any deaths would not have been noticed anyway during that period. Also it takes a while to get seriously ill. Around 1, 5 weeks I believe, from the moment you get symptoms (so even longer from the moment you get infected). Basically what I'm trying to say is that the first weeks of an outbreak (anywhere) are not very eventful.

I think so far only Iran has waited long enough with testing that at some points the amount of deaths start to become really noticeable and can't be ignored any longer. That is what probably would have happened in the US if they didn't start testing for another 3 weeks or so."

In other words, he got into an airplane he wasn't qualified to fly in with very little overall flight time, brought along two passengers, and crashed during takeoff.

I took a mask on a plane trip 2 weeks ago and was astonished at how much more hygiene-conscious I was in general.

In fact if it wasn't for the mandatory testing and self quaraintee she'd have no idea she is even sick. She has no fever, no cough, nothing.

What concerns me is, how many people are infected, that show no symptoms and are transmitting the disease?"

Are there any distinguishing symptoms? My dad got sick over a week ago. 104 fever for a couple of days and then a bit lower but it lasted for a week and a half. Bad cough, sore throat, headache. It’s been a week and a half and he finally doesn’t have a fever today and is feeling better but still coughing.

My mom got it too, expect she has asthma so her cough is worse. But they both had a high fever for over a week...every day. Doctor said it was the flu but didn’t test them or anything. They were so sick after a week that they dragged themselves to the urgent care becuase the nurse on the phone said they needed to be tested for pneumonia, which the doctor didn’t end up doing because “everyone has these symptoms right now.” 

I have never seen them so sick in my life. We were joking about it being the coronavirus at first, but now they both are questioning if that’s what they had/have.  I was legitimately concerned for their well being, especially because I have seen my parents gets sick many, many times but never to this extent.  Is that really what the flu is like..? I’ve never had it. 


I guess they’ll never know if it was the coranovirus because apparently you either need to be dying or be old to get tested."

The key is ""overwhelming majority is not 95% like with flu. It's 80%. And ""mild"" includes anyone who doesn't have to be hospitalized, including pneumonia. So you may have the worst flu of your life, miss work for three weeks and have trouble breathing, but you're still in the ""mild"" category. Although some truly are very mild and so mild there are almost no symptoms. But 20% of the population needing hospitalization (as in, will die without hospitalization) is too many. If the cases increase as they did in China, South Korea and Italy, our hospitals will be rapidly overwhelmed, IMO.

A mutation means that the genetic code has changed. 
Since we are good at sequencing genetic code, we can use differences in genetic code to identify how closely related two samples are. This is useful for tracking how the virus has spread throughout the world. If you identify two people with two different virus genetic codes, then it is not so likely that they got the virus from the same source. 

Most likely, the mutation will do nothing or very little. Across a greater period of time, maybe we can expect evolution to actually guide the virus to be more fit -- but that isn't what they're talking about when they discuss different mutations in different regions of the world."

The spread has LOOOOONG since exceeded the capacity to test.

We have no idea if this is spreading faster or slower than the flu.

Additionally, the flu starts each season already well dispersed throughout the nation. It is a year round virus. So people already have it all over the country. Seasonal changes cause changes human activity that causes outbreaks. Children go back to school, people spend more time doing indoor activists, people visit relatives....

This virus started in one locality in the early winter. It has spread globally in 9 weeks. If it had started in the fall, and if we had the capacity to test people at the rate of spread, then nobody would be claiming it spread slower than the flu.

Wait until next year. When the seasonal outbreaks start and this virus, which had been spreading slowly and diffusing throughout the global population, suddenly skyrockets in cases again around October/November...

Then all those people saying it spreads slower than the flu will be trying to explain through their masks to colleagues how they were so fucking stupid,"

When you factor in incubation periods, it takes about 5-7 weeks to really start to see cases increase. [Here is a great thread about it](https://twitter.com/trvrb/status/1234401547364122625). As he states, it takes about 7 days to double the amount of cases. 

This is not intuitive for a lot of people. No judgement, here is a VERY basic illustration (this is such a vast oversimplification, but some people may find it helpful to understand exponential growth). For one patient, in an exponential growth you'd see this: 



Week | Infections
---|---
1 | 1
2 | 2
3 | 4
4 | 8
5 | 16
6 | 32

Now obviously there isn't just one infected person in the US, so this compounds exponentially. It does take time to happen though. So all these people saying maybe it's not as bad, don't get your hopes up. Also, it takes time for this disease to kill you, it can take weeks. Especially when you are put on a ventilator. People are expecting this to move WAY too quickly. We are still in the absolute infancy stages. The 1918 Flu took like almost 3 years to reach it's end."

Federal health officials botched an initial diagnostic test and restricted widespread screening. Critics fear the virus may gain a toehold in the U.S.


By Roni Caryn Rabin, Knvul Sheikh and Katie Thomas
March 2, 2020
Updated 6:31 p.m. ET

The coronavirus has found a crack in the nation’s public health armor, and it is not one that scientists foresaw: diagnostic testing.

As of Monday afternoon, there were at least 98 people infected with the new coronavirus in the United States — a sharp rise from the 65 known to be infected on Friday. Six deaths have been reported.

Several patients, in more than one state, had not traveled to China or other epidemic centers and may have caught the coronavirus in their communities, suggesting that it already may be circulating locally.

The case numbers are rising not just because the virus is spreading, but because testing has been expanded. And the persistent drumbeat of positive test results has raised critical questions about the government’s management of the outbreak.
How is it possible that the world’s most medically advanced nation has struggled to diagnose this infection? Why weren’t more Americans tested sooner? How many may be carrying the virus now?

Most disturbing of all: Did a failure to provide adequate testing give the coronavirus time to gain a toehold in the United States?

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s first attempt to produce a diagnostic test kit fell flat, after it had shipped hundreds out to the states. A promised replacement still does not permit state and local laboratories to make final diagnoses. The C.D.C. essentially ensured that Americans would be tested in very few numbers by imposing stringent and narrow testing criteria.

“Clearly, there have been problems with rolling out the test,” said Dr. Thomas Frieden, former director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which has struggled to make its diagnostic test widely available.

“There are a lot of frustrated doctors and patients and health departments.”

Dr. Frieden said he thought the situation was improving.
“The incompetence has really exceeded what anyone would expect with the C.D.C.,” said Dr. Michael Mina, an epidemiologist at Harvard University. “This is not a difficult problem to solve in the world of viruses.”

In February, the C.D.C. rolled out a three-step diagnostic test kit and distributed hundreds of kits to state and local health laboratories. But the third step in the diagnostic process was flawed, and produced some inconclusive results.

A full three-step replacement was promised but never arrived; the agency has not fully explained why, except to say that there was a manufacturing defect. As a result, diagnostic testing was only conducted at the agency’s labs in Atlanta, not state and local labs.


Getting results took days, and the C.D.C.’s criteria for testing were strict — among them, the patient must have recent travel to China or contact with someone known to be infected.

Doctors nationwide complained of a bottleneck, both because of the restrictive test criteria and because of the agency’s limited testing capacity. The agency said it had the capacity to test about 400 specimens a day.

The test criteria were “too stringent, and people aren’t getting tested,” said Lauren M. Sauer, an assistant professor of emergency medicine at Johns Hopkins Medicine.
“I’ve heard from so many colleagues that tests were turned down,” she added.

By the end of last week, as the first cases of possible community transmission began to emerge in California and Washington State, the C.D.C. broadened the number of patients who qualified for testing to include travelers returning from places like South Korea and Italy, and those with symptoms that could not be otherwise explained.

Late last week, the Food and Drug Administration broke the logjam, authorizing state and local laboratories to do initial testing on their own.

The move greatly expanded the nation’s testing capacity, as the C.D.C. also said it was shipping out new tests kits to the states as well. But final confirmatory tests must still be done at the C.D.C.

By that time, the C.D.C. had tested roughly 500 Americans with suspected infections identified by public health officials in the United States.


Other nations have tested patients by tens of thousands. China has tested millions.

“How come the South Koreans can do 10,000 tests a day and we can’t?” said Ralph Baric, who studies coronaviruses and emerging diseases at University of North Carolina.

“Once you knew you had asymptomatic spread and community spread in China, why is it that the United States of America hasn’t created tens of thousands of tests?”"

how seriously the #coronavirus is taken in #Hessen, I am currently experiencing first-hand: Yesterday I learned from the Portuguese press that a writer, with whom I worked in Póvoa de Varzim, has fallen ill with #COVID19. I immediately call 0800- 5554666 

on the official #Corona - Hotline they tell me it is Sunday and I should call my health office on Monday. More could not be done for me. The health department is responsible. 

But I'm worried, not about me, but mainly about the people I had contact with in the meantime. So I would like to know whether I have been infected. So I'm calling 116117 to tell them I'm on call. 

First of all, 116117 plays a minute-long soundtrack about Corona and that you should wash your hands. I've already washed my hands. I'd still like to take a test. For reasons. 

Meanwhile, the administration of the Portuguese town of Póvoa de Varzim is calling everyone, the publisher of the infected writer is releasing his staff. I'm waiting for a call back from the medical emergency service 

I get a call back with the promise of a ""great doctor."" When I have not received a call until 4:45 pm, I call again. My name was on the list... Meanwhile I receive anxious calls from all over the world 

Around 17:30 a person calls me and tells me to go to the family doctor on Monday. There is no official body in Hessen that would do #Corona tests. Meanwhile I should not leave the house. Whether my family may leave the house is my decision. 

It's Monday, 8:00 a.m., I'm being transferred to the health department. They tell me that my family doctor is in charge. But they do not have the necessary equipment. 

I call the public health department again. Now they promise to help me there, they call me back after half an hour and give me the number of a doctor I could turn to. 

They also send me an Excel list by a-mail, in which I should enter people I have had contact with. After all. 

I call the doctor whom the health department has given me and get a laugh: ""Are you a patient here? No, I'm not, but I had contact with a confirmed #Corona case and I want to get tested. ""We'll call you back."" 

Now I can understand why there are so few ""confirmed"" cases. In several places I could have given up trying to get in touch. I might have developed a slight fever and infected hundreds of others.

\#corona #coronavirus 

my #quarantine is voluntary so far, my son is skipping school, and my working day is wasted trying to find some place that is not only responsible but also takes the problem with #corona seriously. 

update, neither my family doctor nor the doctor I was told by the health department has the material for the #Corona test. Not available. In short: No test, no Corona case. 😆 

It is 13:08 Since 24 hours I know that I am the ""contact person"" of a ""confirmed Covid 19 sufferer"" and I try to get tested. All I have is an Excel list in which I am supposed to write down the names of the people I have met since 

A call to the University Hospital in Frankfurt shows that they allegedly do not test for #Coronavirus. I call 116117 again and they tell me that I should try the university hospital and that my family doctor should call the health department ..."

Every day we live life normally the virus doubles every 6 days.  At least close all the schools in cubicle farms in the Seattle and Portland area.  We can ramp up the closures as the virus spreads to other regions.  People who are over 65 and those who are sick are still human beings and their lives still hold value.  We shouldn’t write a large number of them off as an inevitable death statistic just to keep the GDP up. I am willing to risk a recession and a lower standard of living to keep people safe.

With chefs idle and vegetables rotting, China’s virus-hit restaurants say their goose is cooked

By Gerry Shih 

March 2, 2020 at 5:05 PM EST

BEIJING — In the remote subtropical hills of southwest China, 80 miles from the Laos border and 1,200 miles from the heart of the coronavirus outbreak in Wuhan, Yao Tonghua is facing a serious cash crunch.

Yao borrowed heavily two months ago to put down $10,000 for a five-story building she hoped would become a palace of Sichuan cooking. Then came the epidemic. Her seven cooks now lounge around empty tables meant for 100 diners. Vegetables rot in the yard. Fish bob inside tanks, neglected.

“I thought the disease was confined to Wuhan and would have little impact on a small and far-flung city like ours,” said Yao, who is contemplating laying everyone off and selling the restaurant to stem mounting losses but is worried she wouldn’t find a buyer. “This is getting more and more hopeless by the day.”

Several weeks into an epidemic that brought the country to a standstill, Chinese officials and economists are increasingly worried about the devastation wrought on a crucial part of the economy: restaurants and retailers, karaoke halls and family-owned factories — countless small and midsize businesses that collectively employ 80 percent of China’s workers and produce 68 percent of the country’s business revenue.

￼Yao Tonghua says her Sichuan-style restaurant is hemorrhaging money due to the coronavirus outbreak. (Yao Tonghua)

“Only 30 percent of small and medium businesses nationwide have resumed work,” Shu Chaohui, an official at the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology, told reporters Tuesday. “It’s a pretty severe situation.”

In China’s ‘war’ on coronavirus, hospitals turn away other patients — with dire results

How severe is it? A nationwide survey led in February by Peking University found half the country’s small businesses will run out of cash within three months, and 14 percent might not survive past mid-March. Unlike large state conglomerates or multinational companies that could weather the storm, China’s small businesses say they simply do not have cash reserves to continue paying wages and rent.

And while manufacturing giants that mass-produce gadgets such as Apple iPhones can rely on the government to charter buses and trains to shuttle migrant workers back to their factories, nearly 40 percent of smaller businesses say they cannot get their workers back to Chinese cities because of transportation bottlenecks and quarantine restrictions, according to the Peking University study.

The Chinese government has been trying to prop up these small, vulnerable businesses — but with uncertain consequences. Ministries and bank regulators have been pressuring banks to extend loans to cash-strapped businesses. They have asked lenders to push back repayment deadlines or look the other way when payments are late. They have also waived requirements for businesses such as paying for social security.

Beyond that, experts say, policy options are limited when swaths of the country are effectively under lockdown and a cloud of anxiety. People simply do not want to go out and spend.

“If people don’t eat at restaurants, that doesn’t just affect the restaurant but also the seafood supplier or farmer. If people don’t shop for clothes, that affects the silkmaker and weaver,” said Dai Ruochen, a Peking University economist who helps lead the survey group. “The economic impact isn’t contained; it sends ripples up level by level.”

Then there is the effect on employment. In recent weeks, companies across the country have posted online notices apologizing to customers for closing and to employees for mass layoffs.

A debt cloud darkens

In the once buzzing metropolis of Shenzhen, Cao Tianfei closed a roast-fish restaurant and paid a $36,000 penalty to break his rental contract in a mall that was shut down for two weeks in February. He laid off 15 workers.

“I felt like I abandoned my kids,” he said. “But I had no choice. Every morning I wake up, rent and salaries just get sucked out of me.”

Cao said the unpredictable nature of the epidemic had scrambled his planning. “I’ve never considered borrowing money from the bank, because I can’t see the end of the virus,” he said. “Even if it ended today, it would still be a long way for us to get out of this.”

To counter the uncertainty, China’s leaders have tried to project calm. National authorities have set a late-April target for the virus to be fully contained, and a central-bank official took to international media to tout how China has rolled out no less than 30 policy measures, many of which specifically target “small and micro” businesses, to ensure a quick rebound.

“The most likely scenario is a V-shaped curve, which means a decline in economic activities followed by a rapid recovery, with the total economic impact relatively contained,” People’s Bank of China deputy governor Chen Yulu predicted in a Financial Times op-ed.

But there are risks to China’s desperate attempt to restart its economy, and many businesses will inevitably die off, economists predict.

Chinese authorities’ hands are tied when it comes to asking banks to forgive late payments or issue even more risky loans to bail out faltering businesses, said Andrew Collier, a managing director at Orient Capital Research who frequently speaks to Chinese bank executives.

The coronavirus hit at a time when many Chinese banks were already wobbling with bad loans and households and businesses were burdened by massive levels of debt.

China’s economy, having weathered the trade war, is now jolted by coronavirus

China’s leaders “are trying to straddle between having an economic meltdown and crashing the banks,” Collier said. He added, “They will rather let some businesses go belly up than watch banks collapse.”

Survival mode

Across the country, a few small businesses are hoping to survive by creative means rather than government bailout.

Owspace, a chain of bookstores and cultural spaces that is popular with China’s urban literary and art crowd, is asking book lovers to make online donations of between $7 and $1,100 as revenue plunges 80 percent. Expatriates in Beijing recently launched a GoFundMe crowdfunding campaign to raise $330,000 to save Comptoirs de France, a long-established bakery chain with 16 locations.

Holed up in an apartment in Wuhan, Zuo Weiwei, an entrepreneur who has been selling cosmetics and nutritional supplements online, said the congestion and breakdown in China’s shipping industry forced her to end her business.

“Dozens of customers who had preordered products from me asked for refunds,” she said. “I simply couldn’t take it anymore.”

Hundreds of boxes of beauty masks, dietary supplements and silver-coated Buddhist amulets lay piling up in her house. Under these circumstances, Zuo said, she is drastically downsizing her ambitions.

“I’ve given up hopes of selling stuff and making a fortune,” she said. “My wish for this year is for me and my family to stay healthy and not get infected.”

Have you ever held a gun with the intent to kill someone because your life was in danger?  I have.  It was fucking terrifying and I hope I never experience it again.  Luckily the situation resolved itself rather quickly but I learned a few things.

1.  Walking around and telling everyone how fucking tough you are doesn't mean shit when it actually goes down.  You will be scared and there's a good chance you won't be shooting anyone because your muscle control is going to be shit.  Practice often if you really intend to defend yourself.

2.  If you actually intend to defend yourself be sure you store the gun loaded safely in something which doesn't require a ton of dexterity to access.  When the shit goes down, you're not going to have the coordination to load your gun, not with more than about 1 bullet.

3.  Start preparing now for the idea that you may end up taking a life and what that means to you going forward.  It's not a movie and there are going to be real consequences, both legal and moral.  If you actually get into that situation you're not going to be wanting to figure all of this out in the moment.

I'm not trying to make fun of you but I've met a lot of people who pop off saying things like that as if they're proud and they've never experienced the actual fear of being there.  I am assuming this is you because you just told a bunch of strangers who have no idea who the hell you are or where you live that you intend to kill them if they loot you, which seems like a pretty low risk.  Don't walk around just itching for a reason to use your gun.  It's a tool, not a movie prop or a toy.  If you do use it lives will be changed forever, including yours.  It's serious shit."

We have since calmed down and fewer people are wearing masks (I think because people are realising that they are running out of masks and the cases are only increasing by 1 to 5 every day), people seem to be back living their normal lives, children go to schools, we barely talk about it anymore in day-to-day conversations, although we have to measure and report our temperatures at work....we have business contingency plans put into action and my company rotates our shifts (We have split into two big “teams” each taking alternate weeks to work from home, and done away with meetings involving more than 10 people) I see educational ads being shown on TV, and hygiene awareness info at places such as lift lobbies and bus stops etc.

My fear is that this has become so widespread in other countries that all our measures in containment so far will be overridden by new imported cases from basically any possible country in the world. We are a small country and an international business hub, it’s not possible to just close all borders from the world. So yeah, I am starting to feel less calm in the past couple of days knowing that our efforts in containment will soon go to naught. Wished this virus wasn’t so contagious....I remember SARS and although it was alot deadlier (we had over 200 cases and more than 30 deaths compared to now with 100 cases and 0 deaths so far), it was less contagious and there wasn’t social media around to spook fears into everyone so much, it came and it left.

I have so far heard from 5 friends in the Bay Area who are sick with fever, heavy cough, and coughing up bloody green mucous.

What are Bay Area health officials doing to contain Covid-19? I have heard of a few cases of quarantine, but according to my Kaiser doctor, they do not have access to Covid-19 testing and they discouraged me from seeking testing as I would ""have to be quarantined in hospital"" and ""will improve with medication if you stay home."" 

I now know of at least 5 people who are severely sick with symptoms of Covid-19 and being denied testing. None of us have had flu testing either (my doctor denied it and diagnosed me with bronchitis and sinus infection.) How likely is it that most of the people I know within a 20 mile radius suddenly have bronchitis and sinus infections all at the same time? I keep being told it is a ""bad case of the flu"" going around. I have never seen a flu like this."

Just like most travel insurance doesn’t cover disease outbreaks, most event insurance doesn’t cover this either. 

If you cancel the event, you are still liable for the following: venue cost, union costs, hotel contracts, etc.  This could easily be $1M worth if contracts.  

So it’s fiscally impossible to cancel. 

Not sure if everyone remembers but Boston Comic Con was canceled due to the city being on lockdown from the marathon bombing and it almost bankrupted them. I *think* they might have been bailed out by another organization/merged/sold. 

Many events now have disaster or terrorism insurance, but most of those policies don’t cover outbreaks. 

If the city was shut down/quarantined, insurance might kick in. 

They aren’t trying to be jerk, they are being held by the balls by their contracts and if they initiate the cancellation, they are on the hook for it.

Not. Good.  

They are our first line of defense. If they get sick, we lose emergency services. And it doesn’t take much. Most Fire Dept and EMT services in America spend their work shifts at stations- where they bunk together, share bathrooms, eat food together, ect, often for long shifts up to 72 hours. It’s a breeding ground for illness. Small, overcrowded and intimate living conditions. If even one Firefighter/EMT gets sick, the whole station is contaminated- and they can’t just pick up and move stations. This issue is massive and what we are seeing is just the beginning. What’s gonna happen when there are no more emergency services? Or when our own emergency services are spreading the virus to those who are already ill? In case it’s not common knowledge- Many fire departments house both EMTs and firefighters. Many firefighters are also EMTs. 

These should’ve been questions asked years and years ago. They clearly weren’t even showing up in hazmat- which they have and are trained in. They weren’t even briefed. 

When we talked (weeks ago) about what would happen if the virus was already circulating, we said that it would eventually get bad enough that they would realize it was spreading because of cases in Nursing Homes and EMTs/Firefighters. This is exactly what we talked about."
