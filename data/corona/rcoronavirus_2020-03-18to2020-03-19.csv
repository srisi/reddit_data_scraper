The experience in China is the most critical data we have. They did their ""shut down"" and were able to reduce the number of cases. They are testing widely so they see rebounds immediately and so far there have not been a lot. They avoided widespread infection. The Imperial model does not match this experience. Models are only as good as the assumptions put into them. People are working on models that match what we are seeing more closely and they will become a key tool. A group called Institute for Disease Modeling that I fund is one of the groups working with others on this."

You get bailed out, you get bailed out by having the government become an owner of the company. Either in the form of equity, or better yet, preferreds, so they can't pay a dividend or buy back stock until the government is fully paid back with interest. 

I was advocating for this in 2008 and I will continue to advocate for it now. Bailouts are not free. Make the companies taking them pay back the American taxpayer with interest and people will be more careful about this in the future.

Edit: ""Forever"" is too long (also if it's only buybacks and not dividends that is a meaningless restriction) because at that point the equity holder would prefer to just go bankrupt and collect the recovery value, which would be higher than owning a stock that could never distribute cash again. Also you'd have to account for mergers, etc. if they were bought by someone else. The correct way to do this in finance, and it's a solved problem, is with preferred stock or senior debt with covenants that prohibit buybacks and dividends until it is paid off. I assume Cuban ultimately meant this as he knows what he is talking about but was just speaking off the cuff. Point is, you want a bailout? Pay up, so the taxpayer benefits first."

Ideally a growing business would reinvest the profits since they can do so profitably grow the company and raise the stock price that way. When a business is so big in its sector that it literally doesn't know what to do with the extra money they then either pay dividends or buy back stock or potentially sit on the cash. Apple is an example of a company just sitting on cash for a rainy day or some future opportunity.

So really the logical reason to not want to bail out companies that did stock buybacks is that in the not so distant past they had more money than they knew what to do with but didn't keep a rainy day fund."

Manufacturing engineer here. You have no idea what you are talking about. I don't mean that as an attack, I mean that to point out that it isn't that simple and I'd like to inform you about some realities in Manufacturing.

Manufactured products like ventilators today are built to high tolerances and are often much more complex than manufactured items in the 1940s. They involve high tolerances, lots of various materials, and often complex computer controlled equipment to make the various parts.

Retooling a factory is not like changing your drill bits and now you're building ventilators. It may take a month or more to pivot a factory like that. You need a production plan. I had a college class where I made a production plan for a hydraulic press. A relatively simple one. It took us an entire semester about 40 hours a week with 2-3 people to create this plan. 

Also when you say ""manufacturers should act."" Let's break that statement down. Manufacturers is a broad category. They make a large variety of finished goods. Let's take the factory that manufactures MDF wood laminate table tops. That factory is not going to be building ventilators, or even parts for ventilators using their CNC routers, table saws, laminate press, and edge banding machines.

Neither is the factory that makes soda cans using custom, purpose built manufacturing equipment that literally only make soda cans.

The job shop with 60 CNC Mills could do it.

Factories today are often highly specialized, and have lots of secondary parts suppliers for complex products. A factory that makes power drills for example may buy it's battery cells from one manufacturer, the electric motor from another, and hire a contract manufacturer to make the molded housings.

The factory that fills the soda cans gets them from a factory that makes the soda cans.

Ford factories buy lots of parts from other factories.

You often have to coordinate multiple factories together to supply all that is required for a complex medical device like a ventilator. 

And then, medical device industry is highly regulated and has things like clean room facilities for assembly and testing etc. Depending on what's being made.

So it's very easy to log into Reddit and say ""Manufacturers should start building ventilators right away there is no excuse"".

The reality of modern Manufacturing is much more nuanced and complex than you know."

Iran, Italy, and South Korea then put up their own blinker lights to tell people coming from down the highway to tell people to slow down.

The US is coming barreling down at full speed, sees the emergency lights, and instead of stopping, thinks it's a hoax and that there's no point in slowing down.

Another aspect is having the whole world look at you and think about how differently they would spend the money than you and never, ever again knowing if people truly like, let alone love you.

Then there is the daily effort to simultaneously flaunt + also hide your assets and worrying that everyone is stealing from you (and many are).

He kept me as a friend because he knew I would not trade places with him for all the money in the world, lol.  His life, after that check, has truly sucked - it's like another kind of lonely, awful poverty and I know no one believes me."

In the Netherlands there's been a lot of controversy about the 'herd immunity' strategy. As such, prime minister Rutte and the RIVM(Dutch health institute) have elaborated on their plan and claim their strategy actually isn't different from that of other countries at all and more or less aligns with the guidelines of the WHO.

According to mr Rutte and the RIVM the Netherlands aren't really trying to generate herd immunity but rather taking it as a 'given' because they believe people will be infecfed regardless. Their reasoning is that with a complete shut down infections will inevitably increase again after the restrictions are lifted, leaving the countries in a constant state of shut down > no shut down > shut down > no shut down until a vaccine is publically made available. 

Therefore, they say it's safer to 'ease in' infections so our hospitals don't get overloaded and as a bonus generate very slight herd immunity. According to the RIVM and Rutte, this is the same strategy as France, Italy, Germany etc. are implementing.

What are your thoughts on this criticism of the shut down strategy and the argument in support of the Dutch strategy?"

2020-03-18,ssldvr,Coronavirus,96,https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/fl0y9q/sorry_america_the_full_lockdown_is_coming/fkvz0rt/,"Full article by [Laurie Garrett](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laurie_Garrett):

A few days ago I shared wine, cheese, and camaraderie with a small group of close friends, and sadly, after five excellent bottles of Côtes du Rhône wine, we said goodbye to one another, knowing we shall not again share company for many weeks, perhaps months. Yesterday my dearest neighbors knocked on the door, carts loaded with suitcases and boxes in tow, to wish me well for the duration of the great pandemic. We air-hugged, and I sadly watched them tromp off to their packed vehicle, abandoning New York City for their country home. As they wandered off, I said, “See you in September, I hope—or whenever things are normal again.”

For some countries—Italy, South Korea, and Singapore for example—the moment of decision and personal preparation has long since passed, and millions of people are stuck in place, watching their epidemic unfold. On the eve of St. Patrick’s Day, the mayor of San Francisco ordered her entire population to “shelter in place” for a few weeks: The window of opportunity to relocate has closed for residents of the Bay Area.

Whether you are reading this in your living room in Vancouver, office in London, or on a subway in New York City, you need to think hard, and fast, about two crucial questions: Where, and with whom, do you want to spend the next six to 12 weeks of your life, hunkered down for the epidemic duration? And what can you do to make that place as safe as possible for yourself and those around you?

Your time to answer those questions is very short—a few days, at most. Airports will close, trains will shut down, gasoline supplies may dwindle, and roadblocks may be set up. Nations are closing their borders, and as the numbers of sick rise, towns, suburbs, even entire counties will try to shut the virus out by blocking travel. Wherever you decide to settle down this week is likely to be the place in which you will be stuck for the duration of your epidemic.

To appreciate what lies ahead for the United States, Canada, Mexico, and the United Kingdom, pay heed to Italy, France, and Germany. The United States, for example, is currently tracking exactly where Italy was about 10 days ago. France and Germany, which track two to five days ahead of the United States, are now revving up measures akin to those taken by Italy, including lockdowns on movement and social activity. In a matter of days, the United States will follow suit.

If you live alone, have no family members or close friends who require your special attention, and have no alternative living space, you have no decision to make. You are where you will be for coming weeks.

Many households are now swelling as colleges and universities close, sending students to their parents’ homes, and young adults find themselves facing financial ruin amid the shutdown of theaters, restaurants, gig economy work, construction sites, and other forms of employment lacking job protection and home leave assistance. These young adults may also choose to return to their parents’ homes, or to secondary residences owned by friends or relatives.

As employers shift to work-from-home status, white-collar workers with salaried jobs need to consider where best to hunker down, allowing them strong Internet access and a home work setting. For workers whose jobs require physical presence at a work site, such as custodians, factory workers, security guards, construction personnel, taxi drivers, and the like, the relocation option is decided—stay put. But many may lose their jobs, either temporarily or permanently, due to the epidemic, and the prospect of six to eight weeks without an income stream is excruciating. Anybody facing that prospect should immediately negotiate with their landlords, mortgage lenders, and utilities, seeking long-term payment options, and scour for information regarding their legal rights if threatened with eviction, power shut-off, or lost credit due to epidemic-spawned nonpayment.

Because elderly people, particularly those with underlying medical conditions, are at special risk for severe reactions to COVID-19, including death, many families are making choices to move closer to their aged loved ones, or bring them to live with their adult children and grandchildren. These can be painful decisions, particularly if the elder’s health requires daily attention or features dementia. As the epidemic worsens, it will become increasingly dangerous for such elders to travel: Tough choices must be made immediately.

Once tough location decisions have been made, the household must be readied for a long siege. While panic-buying has led to stockpiles of toilet paper and hand sanitizer, getting through eight months of confinement with others will require a great deal more, both physically and psychologically. This is especially true for households that span generations.

Long-term confinement that includes children undergoing remote schooling and adults trying to work requires designated spaces for each individual, a powerful Internet signal and Wi-Fi router, and a great deal of shared patience. Everybody in the household must understand how the coronavirus is spread, and what steps each should follow to eliminate their personal risk of passing infection to others in the home.

The virus is transmitted by droplets and fomites—it isn’t like measles, capable of drifting about in the air for hours. It dehydrates quickly if not inside water, mucus, or fomite droplets. The size of the droplets may be far below what the human eye can see, but they are gravity-sensitive, and will fall from an individual’s mouth down, eventually, to the nearest lower surface—table, desk, floor. You do not need to clean upward.

However, a newly published study, backed by the National Institutes of Health, found that the virus survives in “aerosols for up to three hours, up to four hours on copper, up to 24 hours on cardboard and up to two to three days on plastic and stainless steel.” This means an uncleaned surface can pose a risk to members of the household for a very long time—a doorknob, tabletop, kitchen counter or stainless steel utensil.

Both the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and Occupational Safety and Health Administration have posted cleaning guidelines, indicating which simple, inexpensive products can eliminate the coronavirus from surfaces in your household or work areas. Give special attention to the most commonly shared surfaces in your home or work area: door knobs, light switches, phones, faucets, toilet handles, kitchen utensils, computer keyboards, and remote controls.

The virus is killed by ultraviolet sunlight, and air flow will hasten dehydration. Do not create air flow by turning on building central air systems—you will spread contamination. If there are windows, open them wide and leave them open whenever weather conditions allow. If there are curtains or shades, open them and let sunlight pour in.

If available, wear latex or heavy-duty dishwashing gloves while cleaning anything that an individual suspected to be infected with COVID-19 has had contact with. Place all used gloves and other disposable contaminated items in a bag that can be tied closed before disposing of them with other waste. Wash hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds immediately after removing gloves.

If you live in an apartment, condominium, or co-housing facility, ask management to post signs limiting the number of people allowed to share an elevator to however many can fit in the cars while maintaining a distance of three feet from one another. Elevator buttons should be cleaned regularly. Deliveries should be left in a common area, such as the building lobby, rather than having outsiders use the elevators and knock on household doors.

And all residents should be asked to please be mindful of contagion courtesy, covering mouths when coughing or sneezing and teaching children to do the same. After coughing or sneezing into hands, do not touch public surfaces in the building such as elevator buttons, banisters, and door handles.

It’s also important to prepare psychologically. Every family or couple has its issues, and tensions can amplify during long confinement. Common sense can ease the shared suffering.

If children are undergoing remote schooling, and parents are simultaneously working remotely, everybody needs headphones, plenty of computer bandwidth, and a designated workspace. Before stores close, make sure every user has proper cables, headphones, batteries, adapters, and other tools of the computer trade.

Printers, if they will be used, require paper and ink: Have plenty on hand.

Everybody needs routines, including exercise and recreation. Shared burdens of cooking and cleaning should be offset by shared play and fun.

Boredom and stress can suck the lifeblood out of a person. Before your home goes on lockdown, make sure your download accounts for movies and television are paid. There are plenty of good books around the house, and games and decks of cards are handy.

Plan now for your state of siege. Don’t delay. Choose where you want to survive the pandemic, with whom, and how. Your window of opportunity to act is shrinking, very fast."

I hadn't heard about this, so I looked into it. For anyone curious, they used a simple online registry and regional text messages to notify people that may have been exposed. The Washington Post wrote a [good article](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/asia_pacific/coronavirus-south-korea-tracking-apps/2020/03/13/2bed568e-5fac-11ea-ac50-18701e14e06d_story.html) about it.

It seems like we could take it a step further and create an app that allows users to track their movements (local storage only) and then upload 7-14 days of anonymized time/place data to an online registry when they test positive. The same app could then check the user's local time/place records for overlaps with the online registry to determine if they crossed paths with an infected individual and let them know they're at a heightened risk."

I used to work at target so I assumed it was the usual rah rah corporate propaganda but every single time they've proven to live up to those values.     

They've closed down almost all their stores in cooperation with the edicts about bars and restaurants out here in southern California, and they've continued to pay each and every worker while they are closed. Additionally, they've planned to reopen all there stores, even the unprofitable ones, as soon as is safe.

His whole political strategy was to campaign on the economy and this virus tore it all apart. Even worse, he gave his opposition plenty of ammo with the outstanding incompetence of his early response to it. 

We're seeing a narcissist going through the stages of grief as he comes to terms with the fact this virus is what will define his presidency now, not a booming economy. And the way he delegated the response to Pence has totally sidelined him so he is just another spectator at most press conferences now. Dude is totally fucking lost and lost control of his administration. We're witnessing an emperor has no clothes moment as all these people - Dr Fauci especially - outshine him and dominate the room now, exposing Trump as the buffoon that he is. Today must have been especially difficult for him since we just fell to the same level the market was at when he was sworn in. All of those gains he spent 3 years bragging about are gone.

Trump is politically neutered by this virus. He can't fire people who contradict him anymore because they're the ones leading the response to an actual crisis that affects his supporters lives. He knows he can't run his mouth anymore so mainly he's sticking to the teleprompter when it's his turn to speak."

Airlines based in America have made 49 billion in profits in the last 10 years. They spent 47 billion of that on stock buybacks.

They could've used that money as cash reserves, upgrading their planes, employee benefits, etc. Instead they used all their profits to make their stockholders richer. 

Now that their business model is collapsing, they want a 60 billion dollar bailout. But they could've used their profits so they could withstand a downturn like they have now.

Everything you say is completely correct. I want to add that even if all of the equipment was in place and all of the drawings were made, and all of the programs were already written, and all of the raw materials were at your doorstep, you would still have a very difficult time getting a functional product out the door without production stoppages and high failure rates. It takes time and experience for production engineering, QC, etc to figure out where the quirks in the system are. That after 15 parts the bore i.d. of a tight tolerance part goes undersize because the previous process heated the material up. Or that because a coolant pump is hard plumbed to the machine, when it kicks on the entire machine hits it resonant frequency and causes out of roundness conditions (yes I've seen this and it took 3+ months of several vendor reps to figure out).

1. Taiwan has been preparing for this since they lost \~40 people to SARS in 2003.
2. Taiwan has arguably the world's best healthcare system.
3. Although it exists to some extent, Taiwanese politics and media aren't as gaslit as American politics.  When things like this happen, society isn't flooded with a bunch of bipartisan bullshit, conspiracy theories, etc.
4. Taiwan has had the CDC act as the mouthpiece for the response, rather than the president.  This keeps politics out of it and allows everybody to trust the scientists and doctors in charge.
5. Education is #1 in Taiwan.  People are smart, and this is kind of like an international competence test.  People here just have a better understanding of how to react.

There are many more reasons, these are just a few."

Compare this to Italy where only 2 of the deceased so far were under 40. And it's not like young people don't get infected in Italy.

Grace Fusco — mother of 11, grandmother of 27 — would sit in the same pew at church each Sunday, surrounded by nearly a dozen members of her sprawling Italian-American family. Sunday dinners drew an even larger crowd to her home in central New Jersey.
Now, her close-knit clan is united anew by unspeakable grief: Mrs. Fusco, 73, and four of her children are hospitalized with coronavirus. Two children who contracted the virus have died in the last week.
Mrs. Fusco’s eldest child, Rita Fusco-Jackson, 55, of Freehold, N.J., died Friday with the virus, a relative said. Her eldest son, Carmine Fusco, of Bath, Pa., died on Wednesday, said the relative, Roseann Paradiso Fodera.
Three of the four siblings who remain hospitalized are in critical condition, Ms. Paradiso Fodera said.

Mrs. Fusco, of Freehold, is “gravely ill” and breathing with help from a ventilator, said Ms. Paradiso Fodera, a lawyer who is Mrs. Fusco’s cousin and is serving as a family spokeswoman.
“My cousin Grace doesn’t realize her two oldest children have passed,” she said.

Nearly 20 other relatives are quarantined at their homes, praying in isolated solitude, unable to mourn their deep collective loss together.

“If they’re not on a respirator, they’re quarantined,” Ms. Paradiso Fodera said.
“It is so pitiful,” she added. “They can’t even mourn the way you would.”

As of Wednesday afternoon, five New Jersey residents had died after contracting the virus, which has infected at least 427 people statewide. Nationwide, at least 7,047 people across every state, plus Washington, D.C., and three U.S. territories, have tested positive for coronavirus, and at least 121 have died, according to a New York Times database.

But the virus’s devastating toll on a single family is considered as rare as it is perplexing.
“They’re young and they don’t have any underlying conditions,” Ms. Paradiso Fodero said.

Mrs. Fusco and four of her children are being treated at CentraState Medical Center in Freehold, about an hour south of Manhattan, relatives said. Mr. Fusco died at a Pennsylvania hospital near his home, Ms. Paradiso Fodera said.

The family has deep ties to the horse-racing industry near Freehold Raceway. Some trained horses. Others raced them. The children’s father, Vincenzo L. Fusco, did both, according to his obituary.
A person who had contact with a man who died in New Jersey on March 10, becoming the state’s first coronavirus-related fatality, had attended a recent Fusco family gathering, the state’s health commissioner, Judith M. Persichilli, has said.
The first New Jersey man to die has been identified by a close friend and the harness track where he worked, Yonkers Raceway, as John Brennan.
Ms. Paradiso Fodera said the gathering was a routine Tuesday dinner.
“A party to most people was a regular dinner to them,” she said before counting names on a family tree that listed 27 grandchildren.

The gathering is believed to be the source of the virus, and information about the number of people infected there led to a new intensity in Ms. Persichilli’s warnings over the weekend against even small get-togethers with friends or relatives.
“I cannot emphasize enough how important it is to take personal responsibility and to avoid even small gatherings,” Ms. Persichilli said during a press briefing on Sunday.

Dr. James Matera, chief medical officer of CentraState Medical Center, said he had discussed the uniqueness of treating so many members of the same family with the state’s health commissioner and officials at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

He said officials are in the process of evaluating the patients’ medical histories to look for clues about why the disease might have progressed so rapidly, and been so potent.
“I don’t know if it’s a strain thing,” Dr. Matera said. “I would consider these particular people to be unusual.”
Ms. Fusco-Jackson died a day before her test for coronavirus came back positive on Saturday evening.

Her relatives are urging officials at CentraState or the C.D.C. to conduct an autopsy to learn more about how the virus killed Ms. Fusco-Jackson. She had been in good health, they said, and taught religious education classes at the Roman Catholic church where many members of the large extended family worshiped, St. Robert Bellarmine in Freehold.

Ms. Fusco-Jackson, a mother of three, also sang in the choir, coordinated parish weddings and volunteered in the church’s gardening club, the pastor, Msgr. Sam Sirianni, said.
She had attended a retreat for students preparing for the sacrament of confirmation on Feb. 29, but her contact with participants was minimal, the church said on Facebook.
“I can’t tell you enough about her,” Monsignor Sirianni said on Wednesday in an interview. “She was always willing to assist and to lead.”
The family was among the founding members of the church, he added.
“Until this virus came, they were still the family that would gather for Sunday dinner,” Monsignor Sirianni said. “If grandma was there, everybody came.”

The church has since been deep-cleaned, and Monsignor Sirianni, like all members of the parish staff, is operating under quarantine based on possible exposure.
“It means I turn to the Lord even more,” Monsignor Sirianni said. “What came to mind last week was. ‘Lord save your people.’ And that’s been one of my mantras when I go to pray.”

He said he was struggling to come to terms with being unable to visit the sick at CentraState.
In addition to those who have tested positive for coronavirus at CentraState, a midsize hospital that operates as a nonprofit, 27 community members who have been tested for the virus but are awaiting results are hospitalized under observation, Dr. Matera said on Wednesday.
He said the lengthy turnaround time for test results leaves patients in the dark and burdens the hospital’s limited resources. Patients who might ultimately test negative for coronavirus, and be healthy enough to leave the hospital, are instead being kept in isolation.

If tests were returned more quickly, more patients could be discharged.
“That opens up beds,” Dr. Matera said. “It lowers the anxiety of the staff.”
Ms. Fusco-Jackson’s relatives also believe that speedier test results could have made a difference in her care.
“They didn’t treat her as a confirmed case because everything is so delayed,” Ms. Paradiso Fodera said. “It’s a big bureaucracy. The testing result time is important.”"

I wonder what the value of ""money"" is going to be in 4 weeks? The government is pulling these silly levers with their interest rates and their cash injections as if they have any impact.

People aren't making stuff, people aren't buying stuff. No supply, no demand, no economy.

And these Trumpbux that are going to be sent out next month... Money for what exactly? Rent and mortgages are being suspended. If I miss a car payment, or two or three, what's gonna happen?

Who's going to come out and repossess it? What agency will enforce it? What court will try it? Is my ""credit score"" going to take a hit? How do we even measure credit in a time like this?

It's not just small businesses that are going to tank. Think about bigger businesses, like Apple even. Even if their manufacturing wasn't completely shut down indefinitely, who's going out for a new iPhone or iPad right now? When we finally get through this thing and the world starts coming back online, with most of the world in dire financial situations, what's going to be the demand for luxury goods like consumer electronics?

The impact that this virus is going to have is so utterly profound it's difficult to fully comprehend what the world is going to look like in the coming months. I'm not a doomer, just a realist. Keep walking this scenario of global economic stasis down the line and ask yourself where we end up."

As someone who has been in finance for quite a while, TARP could have been better structured at the time. Direct investment with ownership control (e.g. sitting senior Fed members on the board of these companies) and covenants on distributions until the cash was paid back, with a higher rate of interest than what was charged to be more reflective of the market conditions at the time, is what I would have done.

I think it was a better result than people thought, but taking the right sort of form factor would have had a long-term influence on the institutions in question.

The bigger long-term change for banking was the implementation of CCAR.

Edit: don't take that as a shot at u/probablyuntrue - I think the TARP reference is a good question and that directionally TARP was a good idea, but I give it about a C- at implementation and it could be done much better by sharpening it up substantially as I stated."

One problem: [not many people](https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2019/03/25/home-loans-fewer-first-timers-get-mortgages-under-tough-standards/3271050002/) have FHA-insured mortgages: ""The FHA insured 12.1 percent of all mortgage originations in 2018, down  from 13.5 percent in 2017 and a peak of 17.9 percent in 2009, just after  the housing crisis.""

There doesn't seem to be any moratorium on rental evictions at all -- the HUD announcement [makes clear](https://www.hud.gov/press/press_releases_media_advisories/HUD_No_20_042) that ""foreclosure and eviction"" is being used as a term for the process of first foreclosing on, and then evicting, a mortgage debtor.

This is lame even by HUD standards, but ultimately the US federal government has pretty limited power over rental and mortgage transactions that it isn't a party to. A solution for the coming housing crisis (other than sending people money) would likely require state action."

However, **as of now** our cases are spread out evenly throughout regions, there are almost no clusters with significantly more infections than in other spots. In France and Italy there are a few areas where hospitals are overwhelmed, they also usually report higher numbers of deaths. German hospitals are not overcrowded and even if a hospital is full the next one is not far away, so patients can be transported in a matter of 1-2 hours. I saw in the news today that French transport their problematic patients to more distant hospitals, like from Colmar (one of the infected clusters) to southern France which is a huge journey and can't be done for everyone or often."

That can mean empty shelves, at least temporarily. But retailers and producers can meet this challenge, he says, because America has strong supply chains [for food].

>And at least for now , American food producers are not experiencing production troubles. The barren shelves are simply a reflection of the unusual increase in demand.

So essentially, the continually empty shelves are mostly just a reflection of people buying things much faster than they are being shipped and physically restocked on the shelves.

Our resupply logistics and inventory management are based on anticipated demand, and now demand has acutely surged beyond the norm.

But these supermarket items do get frequently restocked. Our production of food and household essentials is still solid, for now.

You can ascertain this from the state of hospitals. I am a medical student in a large city (not NYC), and right now they are not busy enough to even want me there. My father is a physician who works in the ICU on the outskirts of a larger city than mine, and he has said that as of right now his workload is normal.

This will change of course, and fast. The hospitals *will* be overrun, but to say we *are* Italy currently is just false. It is inevitable that we will have more patients than we have doctors and nurses to care for them. However, when you cite untested cases as evidence that we are on the same level as Italy, that is really not quite right, as Italy has plenty of mild untested cases as well and still higher numbers.

We are on a similar trajectory, but we are not overrun the way Italy is yet. Italy has a far higher density of positive residents. We are 1-2 weeks behind them and will likely follow a slightly less intense path given extra time to prepare, younger population, and lower population density."

Their will be plenty of time for blaming later, I think top priority down there  is paying every citizen so that they're happy for a bit, and mass mobilization of medical services and equipment."

The US was in the low 5000's yesterday. Right now we are in the mid 8000's and the day isn't even done. Thats over 3000 new cases in less than a day and we are still under testing in most states. This is an increase seen only in Italy and Wuhan.

Edit: And now we're at 9005. Thats a jump of nearly 4000 in less than 24 hours."

When companies buy back their stocks they usually retire them from the market which therefore increases the value of the remaining stock.

Essentially it boils down to executives making copious amounts of money on stock valuation increases/dividends by buying back stocks, in this case with taxpayer money."

We now have the technology to use viruses as vectors for good (cancer treatments, etc.) so there is no doubt that some government in the world has not at least considered using them for bad or tailoring one to deal with its enemies."
