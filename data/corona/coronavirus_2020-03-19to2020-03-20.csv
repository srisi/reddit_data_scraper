Specifically: would it be ethically permissible, and if so at what point, to avoid resuscitating even full code coronavirus patients who are already ventilated and have arrested regardless of full care? They felt the chance of achieving ROSC and survival to discharge in these circumstances was extremely low, while the chance of causing aerosolization and infection of staff to be exponentially higher with a resuscitation attempt. 

It was a good question and I felt the answer was obvious--that during a pandemic when we are already anticipating running out of hospital resources, we need to manage expectations with families prior to arrests occurring, and then avoid resuscitation in these events for the protection--and, in fact, the *preservation*\--of critical staff and PPE to help others. 

I understand it is so difficult for us as clinicians to wrangle with this kind of question but resource preservation--including ourselves--is necessary to save the most number of people. Healthcare in a pandemic isn't just about how to save the one patient in front of you--it's about how to save the massive waves of incoming patients altogether. This is not about selfishly putting ourselves before our patients--if it were an isolated infected patient I myself would take the risk to help--but we truly need to think about what will happen to patients and our colleagues if we do not keep ourselves well enough to do our jobs."

	The only US drugmaker that makes a potential treatment for the coronavirus that was touted by President Donald Trump raised the price by almost 100 per cent in January, as the virus caused havoc across China.

Rising Pharmaceuticals, a New Jersey based company, increased the price of chloroquine — an antimalarial, which is one of the drugs that is being tested against Covid-19 — on January 23, according to data from research firm Elsevier. The drug price rose 97.86 per cent to $7.66 per 250mg pill and $19.88 per 500mg pill. 

But Rising said the price rise was “coincidental” and it restored the old price once it realised that the drug might be in demand because of the outbreak. The reversal of the price lift has not yet shown through in the data. 

In an interview with the Financial Times, one executive said that the company had originally increased the price because it wanted to be able to invest in new manufacturing facilities to keep the drug on the market. 

“As soon as we saw the increase in demand and the potential that this was going to be utilised in the way some folks are projecting it to be, we rescinded that price increase to the same price it has been on the market for since 2015,” he said. 

Hiking drug prices at such a pivotal time in world history will not play well in the market for any companies partaking in that activity long term

Michael Rea, chief executive RxSavings Solutions
Mr Trump said on Thursday that the Food and Drug Administration had approved chloroquine for the treatment of Covid-19 — but the FDA commissioner contradicted him, saying the regulator was simply taking a closer look at the drug. The drug is already approved for treating malaria. 

There is no solid evidence that chloroquine improves the condition of coronavirus patients. But there are several trials under way and the drug is being used on a “compassionate use” basis in some countries. 

Small studies have shown positive outcomes, including one in France released on Wednesday that chloroquine had accelerated recoveries and reduced how long patients were contagious. The medicine can have serious side effects, however, including acute poisoning and even death if a patient overdoses. 

Michael Rea, chief executive of RxSavings Solutions, which provides software for employers to lower their drug bills, said: “Hiking drug prices at such a pivotal time in world history will not play well in the market for any companies partaking in that activity long term.” 

In December 2019, Rising Pharmaceuticals admitted price fixing in a case in Pennsylvania and agreed to pay $3m in fines and restitution. The company did not respond to a request for comment about that case. 

The executive speaking on behalf of the company said it is not promoting the drug as a treatment for coronavirus. But Rising received five times as many orders as usual in the last week and it is ramping up production in India to meet demand, purchasing “extraordinary amounts” of more active ingredients, bottles and labels. 

“We have no real knowledge of where this is going to end but we are actively keeping up with demand,” he said."

My immune system either reacts way overboard or completely ignores a pathogen. I am scared too, however there is no point in panicking. Carry hand sanitizer with you when you go out and before you touch your face, nose or eyes make sure to use it. Same with eating. Likewise, a mask really does not do well for prevention unless you already have it and are trying to not get others sick. They tend to be more dangerous because they cause people to touch their face more frequently then they would before. So just stay home as often as possible, have your groceries delivered to your door from your local kroger or whole foods via Amazon. Pick foods that are canned or make sure to wash veggies thoroughly before eating them. 

I currently am working very hard to develop a new coronavirus test at my company. We just released one PCR multiplex kit and we will be releasing a second, autonomous test multiplex PCR test on Monday (sponsored via the Dept of defense). And my company is probably not going to be the only one. So hopefully more tests will be here soon.

The reality is that we don't have enough evidence to make a secure claim either way on this, but Schools and their parent organisations (government, dioceses, etc) have a legal obligation to ensure that they create working/learning environments that are as safe as possible. We've done, practically, nothing to ensure that.  If we want schools to be a safe place to keep the economy ticking along, we need to give teachers significant support in keeping their workplaces clean. Antiseptic hand-rub/wipes in every classroom and entrance and contactless thermometers to check for early signs of illness would be a good start. I know that masks don't protect the wearer, but maybe everybody should start wearing masks to protect other people in case we symptom. 

Again, we've done nothing to protect our young people, teachers, administrators, and their families."

His plan to increase test capacity? Just increase testing capacity, duh.

> Implement successful testing models. Our testing capacity and process has been woefully inadequate. We must massively increase the availability of test kits for the coronavirus and the speed at which the tests are processed. We must look to successful coronavirus testing models in other countries and implement best practices here.

Not enough providers/hospital beds/equipment to treat sick people? Let's expand community health centers to provide dental care.

> Dramatically expand community health centers. Pass emergency funding to dramatically expand access to community health centers which provide primary, dental, and mental health care, as well as low-cost prescription drugs, to nearly 30 million Americans, 63 percent of whom are racial and ethnic minorities. We need to greatly expand our primary health care capabilities in this country, and that includes expanding community health care centers.

Seriously, read that plan, and then read Biden's (https://joebiden.com/covid19/), which contains specific steps and actions that can be immediately put into effect by the executive branch. 

Compare how they would use the military to help.

> Bernie: Utilize the National Guard, the Army Corp of Engineers and other military resources. Several governors have already called in state National Guard forces. Our armed forces are trained for emergency response and must be immediately activated to build mobile hospitals and testing facilities, assist providers, reopen hospitals that have been shut down and expand our health care capacity in at-risk areas.

> Joe: Directing the U.S. Department of Defense (DOD) to prepare for potential deployment of military resources, both the active and reserve components, and work with governors to prepare for potential deployment of National Guard resources, to provide medical facility capacity, logistical support, and additional medical personnel if necessary. This includes activating the Medical Reserve Corps, which consists of nearly 200,000 volunteer health care professionals who stand ready to serve across America; training and deploying additional surge capacity, including U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs/DOD medical equipment and U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) Disaster Assistance Medical Teams; and directing and assisting existing hospitals to surge care for 20% more patients than current capacity through flexible staffing, use of telemedicine support, and delaying elective procedures."

The State Department on Thursday issued a new alert urging Americans not to travel abroad under any circumstances and to return home if they are already abroad unless they plan to remain overseas.

“The Department of State advises U.S. citizens to avoid all international travel due to the global impact of COVID-19,” it said in the new advice. “In countries where commercial departure options remain available, U.S. citizens who live in the United States should arrange for immediate return to the United States, unless they are prepared to remain abroad for an indefinite period.

2020-03-19,hayyache,Coronavirus,24,https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/flmuxc/the_epic_failure_of_coronavirus_testing_in_america/fkziazm/,"I hope this is allowed, sorry I didn’t check I just noticed the paywall issue too and couldn’t remedy the issue on my mobile for some reason.. here it is: 

The World Health Organization, for weeks now, has been making an emphatic plea to countries around the world: Social distancing is crucial to stopping the spread of coronavirus, but it is only half of the equation. To suppress and control a pandemic of this magnitude, countries also must find and isolate every person infected with Covid-19 — including those with mild cases of the disease who don’t turn up in doctor’s offices or hospitals.

For just as long, however, officials in the United States have said something very different: If you suspect you’re infected, stay home. Even those who live in close quarters with someone who faces a higher risk of becoming severely ill or dying from the infection, have been discouraged from seeking testing unless they are having difficulty breathing.

There are valid if dismaying reasons for this guidance. A string of failures at the White House, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Food and Drug Administration have led to intractable delays in making diagnostic tests for coronavirus widely available in the United States. The same failures have sown confusion about where and how to get tests and have forced clinicians to make tough choices about how to ration the tests that are available.

But there is no question that the W.H.O.’s approach works better. Every region that has managed to get a coronavirus outbreak under control has succeeded thanks to a combination of social distancing and aggressive efforts to test as many people as possible. South Korea, for example, has tested some 274,000 people since February. The United States has tested just 82,000, the vast majority of them in the past few weeks.

Epidemiological testing — where the contacts of infected people are identified, tested in turn and isolated as needed — is the only way to fully break the chains of transmission, says Adhanom Ghebreyesus Tedros, head of the W.H.O. Without it, the virus will come roaring back as soon as social distancing guidelines are relaxed.

American officials have not absorbed that lesson. Even as some cities and states enter a phase of exponential spread, with the number of confirmed cases doubling every few days or so, social distancing is not being paired with the basic epidemiology that’s needed. Contact tracing — the practice of identifying and testing every person that an infected person came into contact with after they themselves contracted the virus — has not been prioritized. Almost no efforts are underway to develop the infrastructure for quarantining the exposed or isolating the infected outside their homes, away from their families. In some places, as the case counts surge, doctors who think they’ve been exposed are being advised to keep on working.

Worst of all, widespread testing — the foundation of both clinical care and broader containment efforts — has been disastrously slow to come online in the United States. President Trump and his team have repeatedly assured the country that tens of thousands of tests will soon be available in convenient locations across the country. But media reports make clear that confusion still reigns: It can take days and dozens of phone calls to access a test — at least it can if you don’t play professional basketball or star in the movies — and it still takes at least a few days to obtain results. In some cases, that’s because of backlogs; in others, it’s because of shortages.

The federal government’s mind-boggling failure has bred an apathy that’s as virulent as any microbe. With coronavirus outbreaks in the states of New York and Washington stretching into their second months, some experts have all but given up on testing, saying that the virus has probably spread well beyond our ability to contain it. Based on that logic, people who are known to have been exposed are being advised to isolate themselves at home but are not being tested to determine whether they pose a risk to roommates or relatives, nor are they being monitored for symptoms in any consistent or meaningful way. It also means those who have immunities can’t know it, and thus can’t know they are in a position to safely help those who were high risk. 

In China, when officials realized that some 80 percent of Covid-19 cases involved infected people passing the virus to their family members, the government built large-scale isolation units where those people could be cared for a safe distance from their loved ones. In South Korea, when an early outbreak was pegged to one large church, health workers began tracing the contacts of more than 200,000 of that church’s members. They quarantined all of the people who were exposed, monitored them and sent anyone who became symptomatic to an isolation center.
In the United States, no such efforts are even in the offing.

It’s true that testing is not a panacea. When people venture out for a test, they risk becoming infected by someone else — or infecting others. But other countries have managed to mitigate such risks, and there’s no reason the United States can’t do so as well.

For one, leaders ought to dramatically increase the number of drive-through testing sites, which help minimize exposure to others. Epidemiologists also have suggested expediting contact tracing by redeploying health workers who have been screening passengers at airports to communities dealing with active outbreaks. Using cellphone tracking capabilities, as Israel is already doing, could also help, although the privacy concerns would be substantial and adequate protections would have to be put in place.

None of these measures will be cheap or easy to implement, but neither are the tactics that officials are deploying now. The alternative scenario, in which America maintains this status quo, will be nothing short of devastating."

An infection control experiment that was rolled out in a small Italian community at the start of Europe’s coronavirus crisis has stopped all new infections in the town that was at the centre of the country’s outbreak.

Through testing and retesting of all 3,300 inhabitants of the town of Vò, near Venice, regardless of whether they were exhibiting symptoms, and rigorous quarantining of their contacts once infection was confirmed, health authorities have been able to completely stop the spread of the illness there.

Andrea Crisanti, an infections expert at Imperial College London who is taking part in the Vò project while on sabbatical at the University of Padua, urged countries that have been limiting virus testing, which includes the UK and US, to learn lessons and ramp up the numbers of people being screened.

“In the UK, there are a whole lot of infections that are completely ignored,” Prof Crisanti told the Financial Times. “We were able to contain the outbreak here because we identified and eliminated the ‘submerged’ infections and isolated them,” he said of the Vò approach. “That is what makes the difference.”

The success underscores the importance of testing and isolating otherwise healthy carriers, an approach that has been strongly endorsed by the World Health Organization. The WHO this week urged all countries to test aggressively, noting that South Korea and Taiwan were having success in limiting infections by doing so. “Our key message is: test, test, test,” Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO chief, said on Monday.

Prof Crisanti said the unusual — and in some ways accidental — testing experiment in Vò allowed researchers to obtain a full “epidemiological picture” of the disease.

The testing began as a scrambled contingency measure after Italy’s first virus-related death there on February 22. It is unclear why northern Italy experienced a surge in cases ahead of other parts of Europe, although Prof Crisanti and others have suggested it may be because of close commercial ties to China.

The first testing round, carried out on the town’s entire population in late February, found 3 per cent of the population infected, though half of the carriers had no symptoms. After isolating all those infected, the second testing round about 10 days later showed the infection rate had dropped to 0.3 per cent.

Importantly, however, this second round identified at least six individuals who had the virus but no symptoms, meaning they could be quarantined. “If they hadn’t been identified, the infection would have resumed,” explained Prof Crisanti.

Rather than extensive testing, countries including the UK and the Netherlands had been pursuing a “herd immunity” strategy, which involved allowing more people to catch the virus and develop immunity to it, as a way of building up resistance in the community — though these policies are changing as the crisis intensifies.

A WHO doctor said on Tuesday that aiming for herd immunity may not be the right way to contain the virus. Dorit Nitzan, WHO health emergencies co-ordinator for Europe, said that because so little was known about the coronavirus it was “not the right time for us to recommend” a herd immunity approach. “It is a new virus and we have to learn,” she said.

Britain has not been testing people with mild symptoms but is focusing on patients with serious respiratory illness. However, an abrupt reversal of policy by Boris Johnson’s government this week will see the UK increase testing as part of its efforts to stop new infections and “flatten the curve” so as not to overburden health services and to reduce fatalities.

In Veneto, the authorities plan to expand the aggressive testing regime in the whole region and are seeking to take at least 11,000 swabs a day. “If someone calls the [virus] hotline and says they are sick then everyone in the family, all their friends and the whole building get tested,” said Prof Crisanti.

Luca Zaia, president of Veneto who initiated the Vò project, on Tuesday reinforced the position that widespread testing was vital. “An asymptomatic carrier can infect 10 people,” he told reporters. “Swabs can save lives.”"

## The vice president of the Chinese Red Cross, who defeated the virus in Wuhan, at Palazzo Lombardia with President Fontana: ""Too many people around without masks, economic activities must be closed and everyone must stay at home""

 In Lombardy ""in the region most affected"" by Coronavirus ""unfortunately the policies are not yet as tight as according to our standards. People don't wear masks, there are still too many people around, public transport is still active and you eat too much in restaurants and hotels ». The vice president of the Chinese Red Cross, Sun Shuopeng, said this on Thursday morning during his speech during the [press point at Palazzo Lombardia with the president of the region, Attilio Fontana](https://milano.corriere.it/notizie/cronaca/20_marzo_19/coronavirus-lombardia-fontana-oggi-chiedero-governo-misure-piu-rigide-2c06503e-69df-11ea-a8a1-df48c20e9d2e.shtml) . 

##### «Life is the most important topic»

""It is time - added Vice-President Shuopeng - to close economic activities and prohibit the movement of people. We must hurry, we must stop all economic activities and stop mobility. Everyone must stay at home, in quarantine, and we need everyone to be prepared to protect their lives, because people's lives are the most important thing, we don't have a second choice in front of life ». “Everyone is involved in the fight against Covid-19, not just the government, not just the medical staff. All citizens must be involved and follow containment measures, ""he added.

##### «Situation similar to Wuhan»

""With the control and quarantine measures it is easier to identify the people infected by Covid-19 and this can give us indications on the infected people and how to treat them,"" added Shuopeng. ""What you are experiencing now is very similar to what we have experienced in Wuhan, the epicenter of Covid-19, with a very high number of cases of infected people, hospitalized patients and deceased,"" he explained. The very high numbers ""could be a positive thing right now, because we are moving towards the adoption of international practices in the control of infectious diseases"". ""If quarantine measures are increased - he added - it is easier to find exposed people who can have better treatment"".

##### Check resumed one month after the lockdown

In Wuhan, he continued, ""it was a month after the complete *lockdown* in the city that hospitals were able to truly start treating patients, reduce the number of patients and overcome the peak of the infection."""

A new study reports that people who became sick from the coronavirus in the Chinese city where the outbreak began likely had a lower death rate than previously thought.

The study, published Thursday in the journal Nature Medicine, calculated that people with coronavirus symptoms in Wuhan, China, had a 1.4 percent likelihood of dying. Some previous estimates have ranged from 2 percent to 3.4 percent.

LIVE UPDATESFollow our live coverage of the coronavirus outbreak worldwide.

Assessing the risk of death in Wuhan is instructive because it provides a snapshot of the epidemic from the beginning, when doctors were scrambling to treat people with the brand-new virus and hospitals were overwhelmed. Some experts say that such a benchmark — known as the symptomatic case fatality rate — could be lower in countries like the United States if measures like widespread business and school closures and appeals for social distancing have the desired effect of slowing the spread of the disease.

“The experience gained from managing those initial patients and the increasing availability of newer, and potentially better, treatment modalities to more patients would presumably lead to fewer deaths, all else being equal,” wrote the study authors, a team that included scientists from the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health.

But a 1.4 percent case fatality rate still means many deaths. By comparison, the average seasonal flu kills about 0.1 percent of the people it infects in the United States.

The new study calculated estimates based on cases in Wuhan as of Feb. 29, when there had been 48,557 confirmed patients and 2,169 deaths. The risk of death increased with age, “unlike any previously reported pandemic or seasonal influenza,” the researchers wrote.

While the overall symptomatic case fatality rate was 1.4 percent, for people who were 60 and older it was 2.6 percent. That makes the older age group about five times more likely to die than people with symptoms who were 30 to 59 years old, whose risk of dying was 0.5 percent. For those under 30, it was 0.3 percent.

The risk of developing symptomatic infection itself also increased with age, about 4 percent per year for people aged 30 to 60, the study said. The authors estimated that people 60 and older were twice as likely to develop symptoms as people aged 30 to 59 and that people under 30 have about one-sixth the chance of developing symptoms from the infection. That suggests, as has other research, that many young people may be unknowingly infected and able to spread the virus to others.

The researchers noted that their estimates faced some limitations, including that the study would not reflect the many people who were not tested and diagnosed, and that the data might not adequately capture people who were infected in Wuhan and traveled elsewhere. And although their estimated risk of death is lower than previous guesses, the authors make it clear that the virus will undoubtedly leave many casualties in its wake.

The findings “indicate that Covid-19 transmission is difficult to control,” they wrote, adding that “we might expect at least half of the population to be infected, even with aggressive use of community mitigation measures.”

The rapid economic growth in southern China has led to an increasing demand for animal proteins including those from exotic game food animals such as civets. Large numbers and varieties of these wild game mammals in overcrowded cages and the lack of biosecurity measures in wet markets allowed the jumping of this novel virus from animals to human. Its capacity for human-to-human transmission, the lack of awareness in hospital infection control, and international air travel facilitated the rapid global dissemination of this agent. Over 8,000 people were affected, with a crude fatality rate of 10%. The acute and dramatic impact on health care systems, economies, and societies of affected countries within just a few months of early 2003 was unparalleled since the last plague. The small reemergence of SARS in late 2003 after the resumption of the wildlife market in southern China and the recent discovery of a very similar virus in horseshoe bats, bat SARS-CoV, suggested that SARS can return if conditions are fit for the introduction, mutation, amplification, and transmission of this dangerous virus.”


“The presence of a large reservoir of SARS-CoV-like viruses in horseshoe bats, together with the culture of eating exotic mammals in southern China, is a time bomb. The possibility of the reemergence of SARS and other novel viruses from animals or laboratories and therefore the need for preparedness should not be ignored.”"

> LATEST, March 19, 2:52 p.m. Governor Gavin Newsom requested a hospital ship from the U.S. Navy Thursday afternoon, stating that based on state projections, he estimates 56% of California's population — 25.5 million people — will become infected with the coronavirus over eight weeks this spring. As he stated in the letter, ""our case rate [in California] is doubling every four days.""

I mean ... is this projection taking into account any hopeful effectiveness of shelter-in-place and such?

I'm kind of stunned.

-----

Edit:

> A spokesperson for Newsom later told Politico that the 56 percent number reflects the infection rate if ""mitigation efforts aren't taken into account."" Currently, most of the Bay Area and the city of Fresno are under shelter-in-place orders — the most stringent in the nation — but the remainder of the state is not."

*Ospedale Cotugno, estubati primi due pazienti in cura con Tocilizumab.

Arriva una buona ed incoraggiante notizia dall'ospedale Cotugno di Napoli. I primi due pazienti tra i venti trattati nel capoluogo campano con il farmaco contro l'artrite reumatoide già usato in Cina contro le polmoniti da Coronavirus, sono stati, infatti, estubati.

I due, che hanno rispettivamente 63 e 48 anni, hanno reagito molto bene al farmaco. I pazienti sono attualmente in ventilazione assistita ma, se nelle prossime ore manterranno il livello di respirazione attuale, potrebbero presto essere trasferiti in reparto.*

La sperimentazione sta andando avanti in diversi ospedali di altre zone d'Italia, senza volersi sbilanciare troppo i segnali appaiono incoraggianti, stiamo parlando comunque di persone uscite da una terapia intensiva grazie a questo farmaco.

Spero possano dare maggiore risalto a questi tentativi di cercare un trattamento efficace nel mentre si prova ad arginare il contagio."

In the last 24h you had 49% increase of confirmed cases. Yesterday it was 45% increase for 24h. At this rate, if it doesn't speed up even more, your numbers will double within the next 48 hours and increase by a magnitude (10x) within 5 to 6 days.

This could be due to increased testing capacity or because of community spread.

El objetivo de la cuarentena no es realmente detener el virus sino enlentecerlo, lo suficiente para que la curva de contagiados no sea tan alta y no se sobrecargue el sistema de salud, como pasa en italia y España. Esto solo se soluciona con una vacuna (que no se cuando llegará)"

I'm not sure what people think about this Disney action lately. I've seen a lot of people thinking that Disney is going to recover from this in the near-term. I disagree. Neither Disney, nor the tourism industry as a whole, have seen the full impact of this and here's my retarded logic:

1) **Today**, there have been multiple reports about Disney's uncertain future: 

* [Walt Disney World Now Projected to Remain Closed Through Mid-April Due to Coronavirus (COVID-19) Concerns](https://wdwnt.com/2020/03/walt-disney-world-now-projected-to-remain-closed-through-mid-april-due-to-coronavirus-covid-19-concerns/)

* [Disney warns that coronavirus is making it hard to predict future performance](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/03/19/disney-says-coronavirus-has-made-it-hard-to-predict-future-performance.html)

* [Disney says coronavirus could impact consumer behavior](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-walt-disney/disney-says-coronavirus-could-impact-consumer-behavior-idUSKBN2162GU)

* [Breakingviews - Disney business risks getting frozen](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-disney-breakingvie/breakingviews-disney-business-risks-getting-frozen-idUSKBN2133S4)

2) The whole tourism industry is going to continue to take a dump:

* [Coronavirus could be just the start of bad news for the tourism industry ](https://www.orlandoweekly.com/Blogs/archives/2020/03/17/coronavirus-could-be-just-the-start-of-bad-news-for-the-tourism-industry)

       >**""At this point, the hotel is going in the red ... they are not making anything. To frank be with you, I’m completely fucked.""**

3) Disney has made several public gaffes regarding their handling of coronavirus:

* [Disney World Criticized for Staying Open Through the Weekend](https://variety.com/2020/film/news/disney-world-coronavirus-disneyland-pandemic-crowds-1203535716/)

* [Disney denies knowledge of Coast woman’s coronavirus diagnosis. Is that really the case?](https://www.sunherald.com/news/coronavirus/article241312206.html)

4) There's still another Disney Resort to shut down. It's going to get shut down.

* [Aulani Remains Open During Coronavirus (COVID-19) Pandemic](https://wdwnt.com/2020/03/aulani-remains-open-during-coronavirus-covid-19-epidemic-waives-change-fees-reveals-virus-mitigation-protocols/)

5) Bob Chapek oversaw and subsequently botched the Star Wars: Galaxy's Edge launch (-3% attendance Q/Q) and got someone else fired for it. Now, he's the CEO. It's just a matter of time before he'll botch something else.

* [5 things to know about Disney CEO Bob Chapek](https://www.businessinsider.com/5-things-disney-ceo-bob-chapek-bob-iger-successor-2020-2)
>**""His recent achievements include . . . introducing the technologically advanced ""Star Wars: Galaxy's Edge"" land at Disneyland and Walt Disney World.""**

* [Disney eliminates US parks chief post amid disappointing Star Wars: Galaxy’s Edge opening](https://orlando-rising.com/disney-eliminates-u-s-parks-chief-post-amid-disappointing-star-wars-galaxys-edge-opening/)


6) Reports about children being affected by coronavirus are getting worse, i.e. more parents avoiding large crowds to protect kids.

* [The coronavirus pandemic has claimed the lives of an infant and a teenager ](https://www.latimes.com/science/story/2020-03-19/coronavirus-has-claimed-the-lives-of-an-infant-and-a-teenager)

* [The risk Covid-19 poses for children, explained](https://www.vox.com/2020/3/18/21181009/coronavirus-in-kids-symptoms-covid-19-risk)

7) Streaming revenue won't replace parks revenue at all. With 28.6M Subscribers @ $6.99/mo, Disney+ is pulling in about ~$200M in revenue/month, but while all the parks are closed, they're losing about ~$70M/day in revenue (estimated using park revenue numbers from 2018). Plus, all the real Disney fans already signed up.

*I'm betting against the mouse.*

Second, it is different epidemiologically and in terms of the disease progression, for example, it doesn't seem to cause as much disease in children (but it definitely infects them at the same rate). The R0 or reproductive rate of the virus (related to how fast it spreads) and case fatality rate have both had preliminary estimates that range higher than seasonal flu. In terms of disease, both flu and coronavirus cause immune disregulation (and ultimately possible death by cytokine storm), but the pathways in our cells seem to be different ... all of this is still emerging knowledge - we don't know enough!

Lastly, flu has become a regular infectious agent for humans, cycling in the temperate zone seasonally and at low levels year-round in the tropics.

I currently rent abroad in a house share myself. The bank ensures you charge 125% of the mortgage or at market rate, whichever is highest, it is not my choice. The 25% covers, agency fees and insurance. The rest I put into a savings account, I match that amount myself to pay for any repairs that are needed. If my tenants are adversely effected by the coronavirus and unable to make rent, I am more than happy to drop the rent whilst this is all ongoing. My landlord insurance covers all of this and I will apply for the insurance to cover my rent. I am unable to get a mortgage holiday as it is under a buy to let mortgage. There is no reason to be a slumlord and it's actually not productive, I have been lucky with my tenants but I have friends who ended up with some bad ones and practically destroyed the house and refused to ever pay rent.

I'm not sure what people think about this Disney action lately. I've seen a lot of people thinking that Disney is going to recover from this in the near-term. I disagree. Neither Disney, nor the tourism industry as a whole, have seen the full impact of this and here's my retarded logic:

1) **Today**, there have been multiple reports about Disney's uncertain future: 

* [**Walt Disney Company Hits Hard Times**](https://wdwnt.com/2020/03/walt-disney-company-hits-hard-times-warns-that-coronavirus-makes-predicting-future-performance-tough/)
>There are certain limitations on our ability to mitigate the adverse financial impact of these items, including the fixed costs of our theme park business.


* [Chef Art Smith’s Homecomin’ and Splitsville **Terminate All Employees Due to Coronavirus** (COVID-19) Closures at Disney Springs](https://wdwnt.com/2020/03/chef-art-smiths-homecomin-and-splitsville-terminates-all-employees-due-to-coronavirus-covid-19-closures-at-disney-springs/)

* [Disney warns that coronavirus is making it **hard to predict future performance**](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/03/19/disney-says-coronavirus-has-made-it-hard-to-predict-future-performance.html)

* [Disney says **coronavirus could impact consumer behavior**](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-walt-disney/disney-says-coronavirus-could-impact-consumer-behavior-idUSKBN2162GU)

2) The whole tourism industry is going to continue to take a dump:

* [Coronavirus could be just the start of bad news for the tourism industry ](https://www.orlandoweekly.com/Blogs/archives/2020/03/17/coronavirus-could-be-just-the-start-of-bad-news-for-the-tourism-industry)

       >**""At this point, the hotel is going in the red ... they are not making anything. To frank be with you, I’m completely fucked.""**

3) Disney has made several public gaffes regarding their handling of coronavirus:

* [Disney World Criticized for Staying Open Through the Weekend](https://variety.com/2020/film/news/disney-world-coronavirus-disneyland-pandemic-crowds-1203535716/)

* [Disney denies knowledge of Coast woman’s coronavirus diagnosis. Is that really the case?](https://www.sunherald.com/news/coronavirus/article241312206.html)

4) There's still another Disney Resort to shut down. It's going to get shut down.

* [Aulani Remains Open During Coronavirus (COVID-19) Pandemic](https://wdwnt.com/2020/03/aulani-remains-open-during-coronavirus-covid-19-epidemic-waives-change-fees-reveals-virus-mitigation-protocols/)

5) Bob Chapek oversaw and subsequently botched the Star Wars: Galaxy's Edge launch (-3% attendance Q/Q) and got someone else fired for it. Now, he's the CEO. It's just a matter of time before he'll botch something else.

* [5 things to know about Disney CEO Bob Chapek](https://www.businessinsider.com/5-things-disney-ceo-bob-chapek-bob-iger-successor-2020-2)

* [Disney eliminates US parks chief post amid disappointing Star Wars: Galaxy’s Edge opening](https://orlando-rising.com/disney-eliminates-u-s-parks-chief-post-amid-disappointing-star-wars-galaxys-edge-opening/)


6) Reports about children being affected by coronavirus are getting worse, i.e. more parents avoiding large crowds to protect kids.

* [The coronavirus pandemic has claimed the lives of an infant and a teenager ](https://www.latimes.com/science/story/2020-03-19/coronavirus-has-claimed-the-lives-of-an-infant-and-a-teenager)

* [The risk Covid-19 poses for children, explained](https://www.vox.com/2020/3/18/21181009/coronavirus-in-kids-symptoms-covid-19-risk)

7) Streaming revenue won't replace parks revenue at all. With 28.6M Subscribers @ $6.99/mo, Disney+ is pulling in about ~$200M in revenue/month, but while all the parks are closed, they're losing about ~$70M/day in revenue (estimated using park revenue numbers from 2018). Plus, all the real Disney fans already signed up.

Some quotes from article.

""Danny Yang and Susan Joseph's new project, CoronaVirus API, an effort to disintermediate data from the traditional sources of information. The website collects, collates and presents the most recent figures on the virus’ spread through all 50 states. Using a web scraping bot to gather information from relevant government sources, http://coronavirusapi.com is a decentralized solution to presenting people with information they could grow to trust.""

""Yang’s permissionless data aggregator scrapes government websites, which in turn rely on infection, recovery and death statistics provided by local hospitals to states as required by many state public health laws. Nearly three-quarters of Americans trust their medical professionals, according to PEW. Now, CoronaVirus API has created a more direct line to these official numbers.""

""This Tuesday, Yang contacted the developers behind Real Items, a VeChain-based authentication protocol, to provide historical versioning of medical statistics, so authorities are unable to censor or change the statistics at a later date. 

This product, developed by David Menard, adds these medical records to the InterPlanetary File System and then hashes that information onto a blockchain using a non-fungible token (NFT) format."""

He could barely read his speech and stopped at one point for about 30 seconds to read it before gargling the words out. Then a bit later he repeated that this was all the fault of government.

Apparently the Republicans are going for the ""government is the problem"" policy again (as they did under Reagan). Back then they made catsup a vegetable on school lunches. Today they let coronavirus run wild because of government which THEY are running.

Case rate fatality of regular seasonal flu in the US is 0.1%. Arguing that COVID is actually *half* as fatal as the flu defies belief, even with a higher R0. We have reports of things like, ""13 doctors in Italy die of coronavirus"" and we don't really have this with the flu. If you look at influenza death rate, we get statements like this, ""People who are in their early 20s, like Murrieta, are among the least likely groups to die from the flu and pneumonia; less than one person in this age group died of the flu for every 100,000 people."" which is **0.00001.** And this, I believe, includes young people with pre-existing conditions, not just healthy young people. That is not what we are seeing with COVID in younger people. I understand we all want to feel better about things, but I fear that spreading research like this that isn't peer reviewed and likely wrong, is not helpful.

Edit: What I'm hoping for is that these numbers are what we will end up seeing *after* we have a handle on things, our hospitals are not at capacity, we know what medications works, we have a vaccine, etc. I just am not convinced yet that these are the numbers we would see really with *untreated* COVID."

First step is to completely avoid /r/coronavirus and /r/china_flu. They're chock full of misinformation, overt and unnecessary pessimism that boil down to platitudes (""We're so fucked"" and ""Here we go..""), because mainstream Reddit subreddits have a historical tendency to overestimate their abilities. Reddit didn't find the Boston Bomber, WW3 didn't start in January, and there's hardly any reason to believe it's any different now with this situation.

Instead, I'd recommend /r/COVID19 if you're aching to keep up with news. The community is far more level-headed, and it's well-moderated to avoid any misinformation. Still, I can't guarantee it'll be purely positive news, but it's much less alarmist. And, again, take internet comments with a large grain of salt. Misinformation still spreads like wildfire in the age of information. Don't just take a single news headline or a single Reddit comment as gospel; investigate yourself, and use common sense.

And limit your time spent browsing the news. You don't need to sit there all day, reading about new cases on the other side of the Earth."

A Japanese woman tested positive for coronavirus earlier this week just days after being at the same pub as an infected man who told officials he wanted to “spread the virus,” according to a report.

The man, in his 50s, ignored authorities’ orders to self-quarantine after he tested positive on March 4, just hours before he came into contact with the woman in Aichi Prefecture, around 200 miles southwest of Tokyo, Kyodo News in Japan reported.

The woman, in her 30s, developed a fever four days later and now has a sore throat. Officials in Toyota in Aichi Prefecture said her condition isn’t serious but she is scheduled to be hospitalized. She lives with her family in the area.

The man reportedly went to two bars that night but only told one employee at the second location that he had the virus. The karaoke bar reported him to the police and a health care center. Police arrived in protective gear and the bar was disinfected. Officials are trying to identify who had contact with the man that night."

2020-03-19,tenderqueer0,WWU,11,https://www.reddit.com/r/WWU/comments/fliidc/update_all_classes_online_spring_quarter/fkyrmpt/,"""Dear Colleagues,

Later this afternoon there will be a detailed message going out to the entire Western community announcing that spring quarter classes at Western will be conducted remotely through the regularly scheduled quarter end date of June 12. I want to say how deeply appreciative I am of every member of Western’s faculty and staff during this incredibly difficult and uncertain time, and to thank you for everything you have done, and are doing, to maintain Western’s ability to serve our students. 

We are committed to maintaining essential operations, so this means that we want to encourage all employees who are able to work remotely to continue to do so. As in previous messages, we will continue to use Monday, April 27 as an expected return to campus date for employees, consistent with Governor Inslee’s executive order on K-12 school closures. Of course, that may change, and Western’s Incident Response Team will continue to monitor local and national guidance daily to determine when employees can safely return to campus, even as we continue to deliver classes remotely until the end of spring quarter. 

More of the details of this decision will be addressed in that later message and in subsequent additions to Western’s COVID-19 website. For now, I wanted to take this opportunity to communicate two things with you specifically:

I want to thank faculty who are working very hard and under short notice to put together curricula and course environments that can be delivered remotely. And, I want to thank staff for their work on delivering the much needed services for the university to function effectively, from working with students and families to ensuring that our facilities and workspaces are safe, to cite just a few examples. Thank you.

I also want to acknowledge that the personal stresses imposed by social distancing and the closures of so many of the services, amenities, and social opportunities that make our personal lives functional and enjoyable adds enormously to the strain. I know that those with caregiving responsibilities for children or elders are under pressure to do even more with less time. And, some of us have been or will be personally touched by the health impacts of COVID-19. There simply is no map for how to navigate this territory, and we are all learning how to make it work, doing our best under difficult circumstances. Again, my thoughts and appreciation are with you and your loved ones.

Second, I want you to know that protecting the well-being and employment security of Western’s faculty and staff in this ongoing situation is a top priority. There is no doubt that the impacts of the coronavirus and our response to it will have significant financial implications on global, institutional, and personal levels. At the institutional level we are exploring strategies to reduce and contain costs, recognizing that protecting jobs is important to sustain our community.

Again, I am deeply grateful to each of you for the extraordinary efforts and support you have given to our students and to each other during this incredibly difficult and uncertain time. Thank you for your courage and your partnership as we continue to make our way through this challenge together."""

(Might live edit this as it goes on.

Mayor’s part

* Reassures the public to be as transparent as possible, and *real* facts will be given. “Not all bad news”.

* “There will be many New Yorkers who will not get this disease … 80% will not have serious issues”.

* Those over 50-70, pre-existing conditions are subject to suffer. Practice social distancing and “adjustments that are normally unimaginable”.

* Won’t be the same as the 1918-19 Spanish flu due to improvements in medical care & standards.

* Crisis does have an end point, and “will go on for months, will not last forever”, normalcy *will* come back.

* “We alone cannot solve this crisis”, next few weeks / April, more federal aid will be required. Federal government should act immediately.

* Tuesday’s request to get more health care professional, ~1,746 have signed up to be apart of the emergency medical response as of today (Thursday). Mayor wants more people willing to volunteer and/or current/former health care professionals not a part of the emergency response. Mayor gives praise to those involved in keeping the city running despite less man power. Praised the Teamsters, school workers who were present (while school was not in session) to give food to needy students.

* Mayor wants Federal government to be “as good as people of the United States of America”, and wants the community/NYers + government to help out the needy, the elderly, the disabled too.

* Mayor is happy that the government (HoR / Senate / President) passed the *initial* reform bill, but urges “more will be needed” in the coming weeks/months. Wants more healthcare for Americans who need it.

* Grateful the two military hospital ships will come to NY Harbor to aid in the relief effort.

* Chastised the president for “not doing enough”, and hesitating on relief. Calls Trump “the Herbert Hoover of our generation”. Praised FDR who flipped Hoover’s blunders in short time.

* Mayor didn’t like how Trump passed the Defense Production Act (?) too late. “Could’ve done it in January/February”. Because of the act, the President can use the HHS to promote more medical supplies and consumer goods, but “not enough” to meet current supply and demand.

* NYC has at best 2-3 weeks left of some medical supplies at current rate of supply/demand. Wants more aid from US Fed Government. Criticizes the National Guard/military for not being more involved with COVID-19 response. De Blasio thinks military would be more than willing to want to help + be mobilized to help out. “Our military is the only answer at this point”. Military can also bring qualified medical professionals, and medical equipment that’s hard to procure in private sector due to shortages. “The Front is in New York City”. Mayor de Blasio asks why isn’t the military more active in NYC/NYS and elsewhere in the nation’s “hot zones”.

* Mayor will send letter to head of VA & HHS to request more medical beds, more medical supplies and personnel to come assist in the fight vs COVID-19. 

* Supplies needed early in April to help out city response: n95 masks, surgical masks, mechanical ventilators, Personal protective equipment, surgical gowns, coveralls, face masks, gloves. Mayor has faith that domestic production can easily match the huge demand the city needs to counter COVID-19 & expected future growth.

* Comments on Chuck Schumer’s “New Marshall Plan”: Old Marshall Plan helped rebuild Europe after WW2, Mayor agrees the “new Marshall Plan” should be made made a priority to invest more in our nation’s medical care.

**The Bad News**

(Mayor) (nyc.gov/coronavirus for more info)

* “An explosion of cases in NYC” , testing results are good, but “not enough”. Cites South Korea method as an inspiration for testing. As testing improves, cases may grow.

* Every day at 10AM, city will update new numbers, these results are **New York City specific** and *based off NYC stats*. Since Mayor mentioned they’ll try to differ from NY State results, most likely this is what we have to go for.

* 10AM today (3/19/2020), NYC’s results are **3,615 confirmed cases in NYC**, has rose since 10AM today. **22 deaths in NYC due to COVID-19**. Queens leads the amount of cases. Inmate in Rikers Island has COVID-19, moved to secure part of prison for isolation + care. As for those incarcerated and being released due to health vulnerabilities : Mayor sees it as an ongoing issue , and will plan ahead with city officials to release some. 40 inmates are on list, will be released as soon as today.

* Testing availability : 10 new sites at hospitals, can serve “up to 150 people per day” initially, 8 open currently, 2 will open next week, 1 in Coney Island. Priority is on those in need and who reserved ahead of time. Those who drive up / walk in cannot be tested. 7 sites at Gotham Clinic, will open “this week”. Separate from State & FEMA testing centers. “80% will not be serious cases”.

* Gives thanks to restaurants putting up with the new emergency laws on takeout/delivery only, and understand it’s a huge issue for restaurants to keep their staff afloat or do mass layoffs. Praised the effort of city officials to oversee enforcement of those aforementioned emergency laws.

* Mayor complying with state emergency laws to have 25% manpower in workforce for the time being, and promotes telecommuting / WFH.

* Sunday, all non-essential city workers will be telecommuting / WFH.

* 250,000 city workers will “be out of their traditional worksites”. Some city offices shut down.

* “Not take away sick time from those experiencing COVID-19 symptoms”.

**Other things/closing**

* Food Stamps and other benefits are now applied online.

* Mayor understands the hardship some people feel about not going to their house of worship. Reminds people in face of a dangerous situation, some sacrifices are needed. Some people are making home based religious services in the meantime, “good in a certain degree”, but again reminds people that is a *bad* thing to do & promotes social distancing. Seniors and those with existing conditions can suffer. Services with smaller groups are alright.

* Regular people should offer to help out needy NYers, wants hoarders to share.

* “It will get better in the end”.

Also regarding the feeling that you've ""wasted"" years of your life that just isn't true. Everything you've learnt you've still learnt man and the relationships you've formed are very real.

That might be true, but it still makes him racist, as that's the card he pull *every time*.

The reality is that Trump has been taking a lot of credit for things he had barely any influence on, or things that happened in spite of him. The reality is that the house of cards may fall on him, but he can't see it. 

The coronavirus is the first disaster that really needs a solid president. While hurricanes and other disasters have been seriously mismanaged by Trump, they are yearly occurrences, with centuries of understanding how to handle them, and there's solid systems to manage them that work in spite of Trump to handle the situation. Trump made it mediocre, but not impossible. That's not true of a pandemic. Modern world-wide pandemics are something that only became possible early 20th century, and 2018 marked the 100th anniversary of the first pandemic on this scale. Even then it isn't a common thing, it's been increasing insanely in the last years due to a more connected world, but still the last time we saw something close to this bad was in 2009. There were other risks, but they were managed very well. But the recent choice in world leaders around the world, have pushed against modern science and medicine, and decided the lessons weren't as important. This happens, we've only been dealing with this kind of disaster for 100 years or so.

So Trumps' flaws here have been hugely harmful. Trump could have taken a stronger stance, and tried to protect the disease from entering, taking a hit on the economy, but triggering a stimulus to put it on overdrive (which is not a great idea, as it only sets a more catastrophic collapse, but we could argue that's all Trump has been doing during his term). The thing is if the disease keeps going, there'll be hundreds of thousands of dead, it will be ugly, and many people in government, including Trump, are at high risk from the disease. If the disease weakens during the summer, due to heat and everything, it will certainly make a comeback around September/October. Could you imagine having to do this all again? But this time during holiday season? It will destroy the economy, and if it does so well enough it will completely destroy Trump's chances of getting reelected. I suspect he's freaking out, because this time it's not ideas or people, it's just harsh truth, and no matter how much you scream fake news, the world will still the true outside."

While it's important to be understanding and informed about the ongoing coronavirus situation, I was just as disappointed as the next guy when I started to see all the major American leagues drop one by one about this time last week. There was only an extent to which I could be upset, though, as I knew there was still at least one league going. A league that doesn't need to cancel because of a global pandemic. A league that captures the intensity of any other sport, hosted right here on Reddit... /r/FakeCollegeFootball.

Fake College Football is a Reddit game that deals solely with college football. Essentially you guess a number between 1-1500, as does the defense, and how close the number is to the defense a certain play happens. You play a full game/season like this. And this isn't just limited to the gameplay - we have built a full community around this, with a weekly poll, bowl games and the Playoff (of course, [a national championship](https://old.reddit.com/r/FakeCollegeFootball/comments/f3312n/game_thread_2_132_season_3_fbs_national/)), a coaching carousel, podcasts, [articles](https://fcfbovertime.wordpress.com/), and much more. 

While this league is based on college football and uses real college football teams along with the game mechanics of college football, **familiarity with college football is by no means required to play.** At its root, this is a league surrounding trying to guess your opponent's number, and the strategy comes from this, not from real football strategy. We've had plenty of people who don't follow real college football come in here and have a blast as the mechanics are easy to grasp.

We are days away from starting our fourth season, so there has never been a better time to join. As with real college football, teams are grouped into subdivisions; the highest one, the FBS, is full, the next one, the FCS, has plenty of teams open. While many FCS coaches have the goal of eventually being promoted to an FBS job, the FCS has become a great place to stay in the meantime with many coaches to keep you company and who knows, maybe you'll like it enough there to want to forgo FBS jobs and stay. In addition to waiting for real gameplay to start on this upcoming Wednesday, you can also schedule your own nonconference games against whoever you'd like within your subdivision. Assuming the FCS fills up, we will then open up the next subdivision, D2.

2020-03-19,Real-Possible,Coronavirus,11,https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/fl3zvu/can_smart_thermometers_track_the_spread_of_the/fkwhrns/,"A company that uses internet-connected thermometers to predict the spread of the flu says it is tracking the coronavirus in real time — something that had been impossible, given the lack of testing for the disease.

Kinsa Health has sold or given away more than a million smart thermometers to households in which two million people reside, and thus can record fevers almost as soon as consumers experience them.

For the last few years, Kinsa’s interactive maps have accurately predicted the spread of flu around the United States about two weeks before the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s own surveillance tool, the weekly FluView tracker.

The thermometer data “acts as an early warning system for illness spreading,” said Inder Singh, the company’s founder. The C.D.C.’s system lags because it relies on weekly reports from hundreds of doctors’ offices and hospital emergency rooms about what symptoms they are seeing in patients.
Company scientists are uniquely positioned to identify unusual clusters of fever because they have years of data for expected flu cases in each ZIP code. A sudden spike that far exceeds estimates for flu for a given date may well indicate the coronavirus has arrived.

Medical experts were enthusiastic about the possibility that smart thermometers could be used to track the virus in the United States. Having millions of data points allows Kinsa to produce daily maps showing which counties are seeing spiking fevers.

The most common symptoms of infection with the coronavirus is a fever — about 90 percent of patients suffer from it, according to the World Health Organization.

“This is very, very exciting,” said Dr. William Schaffner, a professor of preventive medicine at Vanderbilt University. “This is 21st-century disease surveillance, and we’ve been rooted in the mid-20th century with something very labor intensive.”

Dr. Peter J. Hotez, dean of the National School of Tropical Medicine at Baylor College of Medicine in Houston, said: “If this tells you where there are new major clusters of fever, it tells you where to swoop in with your test kits.”
Kinsa’s latest map of fever spikes shows areas that are known to have many cases of Covid-19, the illness caused by the coronavirus. But the data also point to spots in Florida, Michigan, Arizona and eastern Texas, where not as many cases have been reported.

Just last Saturday, Kinsa’s data indicated an unusual rise in fevers in South Florida, even though it was not known to be a Covid-19 epicenter. Within days, testing showed that South Florida had indeed become an epicenter.

“We can’t say for sure that these anomalous fever spikes are Covid-19, but we believe this is the earliest signal of where it’s occurring,” Mr. Singh said.

Normally, Mr. Singh said, the company submits its data to peer-reviewed medical journals. But because of the national emergency, it will post its maps and data Friday on medRxiv, an online repository of medical articles.

The latest data will be available on Friday on a new website, www.healthweather.us, he said.

“We’re nervous about putting this out there because we’ve built it so fast,” said Mr. Singh, a former executive at the Clinton Health Access Initiative, which gets medicines to the poor.

“But we think this could be super helpful even without peer review, and we think there’s a moral imperative to do this right now so everyone can see it and judge it,” Mr. Singh added.
Asked for comment about Kinsa’s proposal, a C.D.C. spokeswoman said the agency “is not working directly with this particular company, but appreciates the efforts of so many private sector companies to address this new threat.”

Dr. Nirav Shah, a former New York State health commissioner who is an adviser to Kinsa, said real-time fever data “could speed up public health the way Twitter sped up the news cycle.”

Demand for Kinsa’s smart thermometers has skyrocketed since the coronavirus pandemic began, Mr. Singh said, and the company is now selling 10,000 a day, which is creating production problems but also multiplying the amount of data coming in each day.

The thermometers connect to a cellphone app that instantly transmits their readings to the company. Users can also enter other symptoms they feel. The app then gives them general advice on when to seek medical attention.

Temperature readings have been far more timely and accurate than other rapid measures, such as cough medicine sales, electronic medical records or Google searches for “flu,” Dr. Shah said.

Because influenza usually produces higher, more protracted fevers than common colds do, the company’s software estimates which ZIP codes appear to be hit by flu rather than by other, milder cold viruses.

For a few months now, Kinsa has worked with Benjamin Dalziel, a disease modeler at Oregon State University who uses electronic medical records, C.D.C.’s influenza surveillance network and other data to map the way the flu season historically rises and falls across the country.
The company’s thermometer readings “are by far the most high-quality data set I’ve ever worked with,” Dr. Dalziel said. “Our results suggest that we can now accurately forecast flu out 12 weeks or more.”

Kinsa’s maps accurately detected this season’s early start in the Deep South and its unusual midwinter double peak, and did so about two weeks before these signs appeared in the C.D.C.’s FluView.

In a conference call with a reporter, Dr. Dalziel and Kinsa’s senior data scientist, Sam Chamberlain, showed twin maps overlaying one another: the first showing where this year’s flu season currently is, and another showing ZIP codes where high fevers are two or three times as common as they ought to be, according to the flu model.

“For a sanity check on our data, we compared this to what happened in Houston back when flu season began,” Dr. Chamberlain said. On that chart, a spike of green data points appears, rising to twice the height recorded in a typical season.

That marked the early, unusual outbreak of B-strain influenza that hit Louisiana and Texas in November.

The current flu season in Brooklyn is waning as winter ends. Beginning on Feb. 24, however, another spike of fevers began to grow out of the downward slope of the normal flu recordings.

“We can't say what that is, but it's very different from what we’d normally expect,” Dr. Chamberlain said.

“This is where the local health department might want to direct its testing,” Dr. Dalziel added."

Lots of studies are pointing to an asymptomatic rate of between 20% and 75%, but that doesn't mean non-infectious or immune. 

Also, he says you can avoid catching the virus by just ""not standing close to people with cold symptoms 4head"" even though people are still infectious before they show any symptoms ([CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prepare/transmission.html)). Pretty nutty and useless article all around."

**By** [**ALICE SU**](https://www.latimes.com/people/alice-su) **CHINA CORRESPONDENT** 

**MARCH 18, 2020 10:49 PM**

SHANGHAI —  A woman who flew last week from Massachusetts to Los Angeles — then to Beijing, where she [tested positive](https://www.latimes.com/world-nation/story/2020-03-15/coronavirus-test-us-china) for coronavirus — is under investigation on allegations of concealing her symptoms and putting fellow travelers at risk of infection.

The woman took fever-reducing medication before boarding a plane and lied to flight attendants, according to Beijing’s disease control center and an Air China representative, who held a news conference on Monday.

The woman, who was hospitalized and is receiving treatment, is under [investigation](https://3w.huanqiu.com/a/9ee05b/9CaKrnKpWiw?agt=8) for the crime of “impeding prevention of infectious diseases.” According to Chinese law, she could face up to [three years of ](http://www.xinhuanet.com/health/2020-03/16/c_1125717826.htm)imprisonment or detention with possible forced labor, or up to seven years of prison if there are “serious consequences.”

As the pandemic worsens around the world but slows in China, authorities in Beijing are tightening controls. All passengers arriving in Beijing from abroad, including Chinese nationals, are required to quarantine in government centers for 14 days.

Shanghai and other cities have enacted similar measures for travelers from a growing list of high-risk countries with coronavirus outbreaks, including Iran, Italy, South Korea, France, Spain, Germany, England, Switzerland, Sweden, Belgium, Norway, Holland, Denmark, Austria and the United States.

In recent days, coronavirus cases in other countries have outnumbered new domestic infections. While Chinese diplomats and propaganda authorities have [boasted](https://www.latimes.com/world-nation/story/2020-03-09/china-boasts-abroad-of-victory-over-coronavirus-as-quarantine-hotel-collapses-and-domestic-anger-simmers) in recent weeks of China’s [victory](https://www.latimes.com/world-nation/story/2020-03-10/xi-jinping-visits-wuhan-china-declares-success-fight-against-coronavirus) over the coronavirus and its superiority to other countries’ responses, doctors and scientists warn that a resurgence of cases is possible as people return to work and others fly back home to China from abroad.

“We need to be highly alert toward imported infection cases,” Zhong Nanshan, a Chinese doctor and government advisor, said at a news conference in Guangzhou on Wednesday. “For this first wave of imported cases from highly affected countries, we should not just look at their symptoms; we should test them.”

On Monday, a joint statement on strengthening “border health and quarantine work” was issued by China’s highest court, the prosecutor general and other officials.

They identified six crimes tied to national health and quarantine measures, including refusal to implement quarantine measures (such as medical inspection and temperature monitoring), reporting false information on health declaration forms, hiding one’s disease symptoms or refusing to accept customs health checks.

Wang Jun, director-general of customs policies and regulations, said the crimes are serious threats to public health and safety.

“Those who try to test their luck and evade customs and quarantine not only will bear the whole society’s shaming and condemnation, but will also face the scourge of imprisonment,” he said.

At least 25 other people in China have been punished or investigated for concealing their coronavirus symptoms or travel history.

In Qinghai province, a man who took a train with his son from Wuhan to Xining — but claimed they’d been home for the last 40 days — tested positive for coronavirus. Nine hundred others had to be quarantined as a result. He was [sentenced ](http://www.bjnews.com.cn/video/2020/03/18/705355.html)to one year in prison.

In [Inner Mongolia](https://baijiahao.baidu.com/s?id=1661039546249873089&wfr=spider&for=pc), two women reportedly lied about having traveled back to China from Turkey via Abu Dhabi, then broke home quarantine and ate at several restaurants. They were charged with “impeding prevention of infectious diseases” and put under forced isolation and observation.

In Henan, a man reportedly went to a hospital feeling unwell but concealed his travel to Wuhan. He later tested positive for coronavirus. Eight medical workers had to be quarantined as a result and at least one close contact was also infected. He was sentenced to eight months in prison.

The woman from Massachusetts, surnamed Li, reportedly began showing signs of the virus, known as COVID-19, after attending a “company meeting” in late February, Chinese authorities said.

Li, 37, is [suspected](https://ie.bjd.com.cn/5b165687a010550e5ddc0e6a/contentApp/5b16573ae4b02a9fe2d558f9/AP5e6eb2fde4b05e103850e9c9?isshare=1&app=5b42f11ce4b02033f28f5f36&contentType=0&isBjh=0) of having attended a leadership conference hosted by Boston biotech company Biogen. The conference dates match the dates of Li’s “company meeting” reported by health authorities.

At least 104 coronavirus cases in Massachusetts have been linked to the Biogen conference. There were guests from from Italy, where the death toll from the virus has surpassed 2,500, but there were no guests who had been to China, according to the [Boston Globe](https://www.bostonglobe.com/2020/03/11/nation/how-biogen-leadership-conference-boston-spread-coronavirus/?p1=Article_Inline_Text_Link&p1=Article_Inline_Text_Link).

Coronavirus cases in Tennessee, North Carolina, Indiana, New Jersey, Washington, D.C., and Norway — and suspected cases in Germany, Austria, and Argentina — have been linked to the same conference.

Biogen did not immediately respond to a request from The Times for confirmation of whether Li was a Biotech employee at the conference.

On Tuesday, Beijing health authorities said that Li’s husband, surnamed Hong, had also [tested positive](https://3w.huanqiu.com/a/59f133/9CaKrnKpXCk?agt=8) for the coronavirus. Hong, 37, is a university professor who also is originally from Chongqing and a longtime resident of Massachusetts.

*Prof. Osterhaus, from Göttingen there are reports of the first advances in research for a remedy for the coronavirus, what is the situation at the University of Veterinary Medicine in Hanover?*

“We are working with a group around Berend Jan Bosch from Utrecht and have discovered an antibody that not only neutralizes the SARS-CoV - the Sars virus - **but also the SARS-CoV2 - the second corona virus that is currently rampant.** So far we have only tested in vitro, i.e. in the laboratory. Now we want to test whether the antibody can also be used preventively in humans - or maybe curatively if humans are already ill.”

*How do you test that?*

“First of all, animal experiments are necessary to prove that the antibody also works in vivo on the living object and that it is not harmful to living organisms. If animal experiments show that the antibody is not harmful to humans, three test phases can be started in succession on humans.

*How long does it take?*

“That is still unclear, but at least two months will pass before we can start the human experiments. They then take another couple of months. We are currently in the process of raising research funding for both series of experiments. But that is only part of our research.”

*What are you still doing research on?*

“Together with research groups from the Netherlands and Germany, we have developed a vaccine for the MERS corona virus, which we have already tested on camels and dromedaries. Now it is being tested on people. Now it is interesting for us whether we can use the same principle to develop a vaccine against the new coronavirus. It is still unclear whether this will work, both viruses are about 20 percent genetically identical, but the experiment is definitely interesting because we already have the technology.”

*How long do you think it will be before there will be a Coronavirus vaccine?*

“Most likely over a year. There is currently a lot of pressure on researchers to find a vaccine. Nevertheless, it is very important that all potential vaccines are tested on animals beforehand. I think it will take at least another six months to find a substance. But that doesn't mean we'll have the vaccine a few months later. Then production has to be started first.”

*In the meantime, what can people do to protect themselves?*

“Avoid contact with infected people. This is difficult, however, because the virus spreads very early when there are no symptoms. I think the lockdown that we currently have in Italy makes sense.

Facebook and all advertising will be hurt severely.  Might have the cash on hand and low overhead to hide it till then but still.  Alphabet is a bit more diversified but could get cucked by governments not letting them use their overseas money as they attempt to pay for anything in a reasonable way...and it’s on the list twice.  but Google Adsense is probably the only marketing companies will be forced to keep using.

Microsoft and Apple are in a great position in that they can have near zero overhead if they choose to and all technology companies will pretend to be part of the solution.  Make an app for pretending to scan for Corona, treat it at home, or anything related and they are golden whether it works or not.

Amazon is a couple coronavirus links away from people being wary and already stopped taking allowing new non-medical supplies to be restocked in their warehouses.  Things are going to go out of stock left and right...but this protects their workers to a degree...

January 22: “We have it totally under control. It’s one person coming in from China. It’s going to be just fine.”

February 2: “We pretty much shut it down coming in from China.”

February 24: “The Coronavirus is very much under control in the USA… Stock Market starting to look very good to me!”

February 25: “CDC and my Administration are doing a GREAT job of handling Coronavirus.”

February 25: “I think that's a problem that’s going to go away… They have studied it. They know very much. In fact, we’re very close to a vaccine.”

February 26: “The 15 (cases in the US) within a couple of days is going to be down to close to zero.”

February 26: “We're going very substantially down, not up.”

February 27: “One day it’s like a miracle, it will disappear.”

February 28: “We're ordering a lot of supplies. We're ordering a lot of, uh, elements that frankly we wouldn't be ordering unless it was something like this. But we're ordering a lot of different elements of medical.”

February 28: “Now the Democrats are politicizing the coronavirus, you know that, right? Coronavirus, they’re politicizing it. We did one of the great jobs. You say, ‘How’s President Trump doing?’ They go, ‘Oh, not good, not good.’ They have no clue. They don’t have any clue. They can’t even count their votes in Iowa.” “They tried the impeachment hoax. That was on a perfect conversation. They tried anything. They tried it over and over. They’d been doing it since you got in. It’s all turning. They lost. It’s all turning. Think of it. Think of it. And this is their new hoax.”

March 2: “You take a solid flu vaccine, you don't think that could have an impact, or much of an impact, on corona?”

March 2: “A lot of things are happening, a lot of very exciting things are happening and they’re happening very rapidly.”

March 5: “I NEVER said people that are feeling sick should go to work.”

March 5: “The United States… has, as of now, only 129 cases… and 11 deaths. We are working very hard to keep these numbers as low as possible!”

March 6: “I think we’re doing a really good job in this country at keeping it down… a tremendous job at keeping it down.”

March 6: “Anybody right now, and yesterday, anybody that needs a test gets a test. They’re there. And the tests are beautiful…. the tests are all perfect like the letter was perfect. The transcription was perfect. Right? This was not as perfect as that but pretty good.”

March 6: “I like this stuff. I really get it. People are surprised that I understand it… Every one of these doctors said, ‘How do you know so much about this?’ Maybe I have a natural ability. Maybe I should have done that instead of running for president.”

March 6: “I don't need to have the numbers double because of one ship that wasn't our fault.”

March 8: “We have a perfectly coordinated and fine tuned plan at the White House for our attack on CoronaVirus.”

March 9: “This blindsided the world.”

Edit: March 9: ""The Fake News Media and their partner, the Democrat Party, is doing everything within its semi-considerable power (it used to be greater!) to inflame the CoronaVirus situation, far beyond what the facts would warrant.”

Gov. Doug Ducey on Thursday announced he would limit restaurant service and close bars, theaters and gyms in counties with confirmed cases of COVID-19, stepping up Arizona's efforts to slow the spread of the new coronavirus. 

The directive will take effect upon close of business Friday. It applies to six Arizona counties: Maricopa, which had 22 cases as of Thursday; Pinal, which had 10; Pima, which had seven; Navajo, which had three; Coconino, which had one; and Graham, which had one. 

The Republican leader also:

* Called on the National Guard to help grocery stores and food banks restock shelves to protect food supplies.
* Halted all elective surgeries ""to free up medical resources and maintain the capacity for hospitals and providers to continue offering vital services.""
* Delayed expiration dates for Arizona drivers licenses, so that residents who are 65 or older don't need to wait in line at state offices to renew them.
* Authorized restaurants to deliver alcoholic beverages alongside food, and allowed manufacturers, wholesalers and retailers to buy back unopened products from restaurants, bars and clubs.

China, Hong Kong, Taiwan, and Singapore bore the brunt of it in Asia, but others were spooked too. East Asian facemask culture comes in large part from SARS. 

The moment word got out in December about a disease causing pneumonia in Wuhan, these countries activated contingency plans and operations centers that had been set up post-SARS, and the people living in those countries understood the potential severity of this new coronavirus. Asian collective response has less to do with cultural obedience and more with recent memory. Hopefully, COVID-19 inspires similar epidemic preparedness in the West."

“You have the right to remain silent, and *for the love of God* please do” the pestiferous poh poh muttered under his breath, clearly unaffected by my enthralling gastroparesis sob story and acoustically divine rendition of Demi Levato’s Stoned Cold.  “Anything you say or sign in butchered ASL can and will be used against you in a court of law.  Seriously, what kind of sociopath fakes Coronavirus for attention?” 


“Owie!” I shrieked, “these handcuffs are causing a very mild chafing of my eczematous dermatitis!”  *This is so unfair* I petulantly sulked in the backseat of the cop car, experiencing a rare fleeting moment of embarrassment to be seen rolling through town in an unflattering orca with wheels.  “Scuse me, officer?  Do you by chance have any zebra print transportation options?” I enquired hopefully as the belligerent bobby chauffeured me to the local prison.


The frigid hallway echoing with thunderous wolf whistles and cat calls, I feigned a demure modesty as I salaciously sashayed along the prison block in a flattering orange jumpsuit that exquisitely complemented my magnificent cooper birds nest.  *I could really get used to all this attention* I thought smugly.  Finally arriving at my assigned accommodation—a dismally danky shared cell—I was startled to see a familiarly punchable mug.  “Tubefed Thot?  What are *you* in here for?”


“Public indecency,” Dat Thot replied, rolling her eyesballs as she fashioned a shiv from her J port adaptor.  “Can you believe pissing on a grave in a cemetery is a crime?” she shook her lollipop head, utterly exasperated.  “What landed you in the joint?  You off your granny or somethin’?”


“Oh uh NO... no of course not... I, I mean WE certainly didn’t switch out Granny’s antiarrhythmic heart medications for Flintstones vitamins and Mentos...” my quivering voice trailed off, anxiety percolating from my sweat glands as I imagined the truth being revealed about my fraudulent SVT episode.  *If only Gran was still alive...* I reminisced, *so I could keep piggybacking off her debilitating ailments on social media*.  I bit my crusty mustard lip as I valiantly fought back warrior tears.  “...It’s been hard.  And by hard, I mean not easy.  That is too say, difficult.  I.e. not great.  For clarification, it’s been rough.” I needlessly elaborated with retarded redundancy.  “P.S. it’s been a struggkung.  After all, I was Granny’s selfless caretaker for six *whole hours*, and that under-the-table cash money meant a lot to me” I poignantly concluded.


After suffering through hours of social media abstinence and bile spritzes from Thot’s risqué twerking, finally we were herded to the dining hall for some nourishment.  Supper was a succulent smorgasbord of unseasoned soggy peas and brown mush served on a durable metal tray.


“Prison food tastes awful” Thot remarked as she strained to smush the indiscernible slop through her feeding tube.


Following an epic postprandial shit sans my special pink wipes, I headed to the showers for some much needed laving of my caudal blow horn.  I must say, I was suitably impressed with the luxuriously sizable communal shower area, which was even more roomy than the ménage a trois-friendly stalls at Mayo.  “Excuse me, shower attendant” I harped at the prison guard, “I submitted a special accommodations request for a special non-slippery shower seat.  Due to my POTS and special conditions.  I especially can’t stand for long periods of time.  Especially I’ve got the POTS.  It was diagnosed and everything.  It’s been especially hard, but I’m surviving...” 


“Don’t drop ya fizzy bath bomb paddy cakes” the guard wisely advised with palpable indifference."

I wanna clarify a few common misconceptions + specify the exact contents of the speech.

1. The purpose of this lockdown is not to lockdown. It's mostly to test how prepared the Indian public is for a lockdown. He didn't say it, but I assume it's easing them into a quarantine.

2. He phrased it like the lockdown is optional, but harsh words coming from the PM + him stating he's gonna ask state and district governments to help enforce the curfew really means it'll probably be quite effective. As a personal anecdote, several streets in big cities are already completely free of traffic - Indians are aware of the dangers and already taking precautions, meaning this likely won't be as difficult to enforce as you might think.

3. He heavily advocated social distancing measures over the next few weeks, as well as telling people falling complacent is the worst thing they can do. He emphasized how the disease is fatal, has no cure/vaccine, and from other countries the only effective response is quarantine.

4. He praised essential workers (including delivery people and grocery store workers) a lot and requested citizens to assist + respect them over the upcoming months. This included actions like only going to the doctors if absolutely necessary (try calling a doctor if you have an ailment/checkup that isn't 100% necessary) to reduce the load on them, and cheering for 5 minutes at 5pm on Sunday 22nd March to show appreciation.

5. He's created an economic task force to analyze the impacts of the virus. The task force will stay in contact with all relevant stakeholders and make necessary decisions soon.

6. He's requested people to take the plight of servants into account - informal service sector such as maids is pretty big in India. He essentially meant that if someone who serves you (like a maid) cannot come to work in the upcoming weeks, be very humane and take their conditions into account before firing them.

edit for more information: 

7. He also mentioned panic buying and how there's really no need.

8. He talked about how everyone needs to help themselves and others within the communities. He encouraged people to call 10 new people everyday to inform them of coronavirus and necessary measures."

The Guangxi Medical Assistance Team supported the West Campus of Wuhan Union Hospital.

On March 14, after a short 5-day break, the fourth batch of the Guangxi Medical Assistance Team, which originally supported the [Zhuankou Temporary Hospital](http://archive.is/Y39LD/deca2c9ba7f564c9933ac55e4334f8750b885f85.jpg), regrouped and returned to the frontline backing up the [Western Campus of Wuhan Union Hospital](http://xiyuan.whuh.com/page/aboutus.html).

On February 15, the fourth batch of Guangxi Medical Assistance Team took off from Nanning to assist Wuhan’s anti-epidemic efforts, and stationed in the [Zhuankou Temporary Hospital](http://5b0988e595225.cdn.sohucs.com/images/20200314/15b6a108de3b4bba867ccecbce4ca199.jpeg) to carry out treatment. On March 8, the Zhuankou Temporary Hospital successfully closed, and the medical assistance team took a break thereafter.

If there is another battle, we will return upon recall! After a short rest and recuperation, the medical team resurrected with full blood. All 104 team members solemnly signed up to continue fighting side by side with the people of Wuhan, contributing Guangxi's strength to win this battle against the pandemic.

On March 12, an application letter covered in red fingerprints of the [team members](http://archive.is/Y39LD/4a0a1944d5396c289be625ecf4fbab77d0e100ad.jpg) was passed to the Medical Treatment Unit of the [Joint Prevention and Control Mechanism of the State Council](https://www.cgtn.com/special/Battling-the-novel-coronavirus-What-we-know-so-far-.html). [March 13 came a new mission](http://news.cjn.cn/sywh/202003/t3591945.htm) assigned by the [Medical Administration Department of the National Health Commission](https://www.uschina.org/sites/default/files/2018.12.28_nhc.pdf) to support the West Campus of Wuhan Union Hospital. And so 104 Guangxi medical workers supporting the Hubei anti-epidemic efforts regrouped and returned to the frontline, where they will be assigned to Critical Care Unit, Fever Clinic and other units to help treat critically ill patients.

On March 14, 104 medical assistance team members arrived at the West Campus of Union Hospital for a [handover](http://5b0988e595225.cdn.sohucs.com/images/20200314/5e8b5e4c373045c996ca83662f095361.jpeg), began [training](http://5b0988e595225.cdn.sohucs.com/images/20200314/eb8ca9eee3624a36a9cffe2a1c7a6ddb.jpeg), and were soon ready to report to duty.

In fact, they were not [the first Guangxi medical team members who returned to the frontline](http://archive.is/Y39LD). On March 7, the National Health Commission [reassigned six Intensive Care Team members](http://archive.is/MmTZc) from this batch ([including Li Gwaiying, Lu Jianjing, Pan Jiamei from Wuming Hospital of Guangxi Medical University](http://www.gxmu.edu.cn/news/fsyyxw/202003/t20200317_109523.html)) to support [the team under West Campus of Wuhan Union Hospital Fellow Dr. Zhong Nanshan](http://v.qq.com/x/search/?q=%E5%86%8D%E6%88%98%E6%AD%A6%E6%B1%89%E5%8D%8F%E5%92%8C%E5%8C%BB%E9%99%A2%E8%A5%BF%E9%99%A2%E6%9C%896%E4%BA%BA%E9%85%8D%E5%90%88%E9%92%9F%E5%8D%97%E5%B1%B1%E9%99%A2%E5%A3%AB%E5%9B%A2%E9%98%9F%E5%B7%A5%E4%BD%9C&stag=0&smartbox_ab=) with approval from both the West Campus and Dr. Zhong.

According to reports, the fourth batch of the Guangxi Medical Assistance Team consists of 104 medical staffs, including 24 doctors and 80 nurses, mainly from the departments of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine, Infectious Diseases, and [Intensive Care Medicine](http://archive.is/Y39LD/0c2a67988739c7ec184c391c7fc5d284a07fcb72.jpg).

First of all, they shouldn't bribed the WHO

Secondly, they shouldn't jailed their own scientist and journalist who try to cover the truth.

Thirdly, if you seen the real footage, there are actually lack of beds, medical equipment etc.

Fourthly, the statistics was definitely tone down. (This is a double edged sword of course, since you can't just report ""Hey! we got 100k ppl infected"" )

If you think they are praiseworthy, you need some medical pills. The only way to fight this virus is to not follow WHO. Look at Russia, north korea, closed the border real fast. They did do something right, and I will give them that.   

Yeap, there are idiots who still want to party after all these. Those also need a slap as well. Canadian government fails to contain way before this, it is a very inefficient government cause some screamed RACIST for denying entry with China. Lmao, I did not come here to get infected with coronavirus, like wtf. Is not racism to build a wall, is not racism to deny entry

And yes there are chinese who eat dogs, bats etc Not all majority but we shouldn't ignore the fact that these people exist even if they are not majority. **Is not racism to acknowledge these problems.  We need to first acknowledge the problems and solve it.**

Those people who just generalized Chinese, yes they need a slap.

But to say all these issues never happen, means you are just as guilty as them.

To praise China under all these, OMG, please for the sake of humanity, get a brain please!

Ron Paul said it well:

“People should ask themselves whether this coronavirus “pandemic” could be a big hoax, with the actual danger of the disease massively exaggerated by those who seek to profit – financially or politically – from the ensuing panic.”

“That is not to say the disease is harmless. Without question people will die from coronavirus. Those in vulnerable categories should take precautions to limit their risk of exposure. But we have seen this movie before. Government over-hypes a threat as an excuse to grab more of our freedoms. When the “threat” is over, however, they never give us our freedoms back.”

2020-03-19,notdoingwellbitch,nyc,9,https://www.reddit.com/r/nyc/comments/flmy15/nearly_two_dozen_mta_workers_test_positive_for/fkziiov/,"“New York’s Metropolitan Transportation Authority announced Thursday that 23 workers have tested positive for the new coronavirus, as officials held a briefing for employees to allay fears about being infected on the job.

Until Thursday, the MTA said just one worker had tested positive for the virus. Some of the 23 infected workers had public-facing roles, the MTA’s chief safety officer, Patrick Warren, said in an interview. But in most cases they didn’t display symptoms while at work and were a low risk to riders, he said. The authority frequently disinfects stations, buses and railcars, he noted.

MTA spokeswoman Abbey Collins declined Thursday to say how many employees had self-quarantined. The number changes daily and will continue to shift, she said, adding that the MTA follows state and local health guidelines when dealing with people who may have been exposed. “We are doing everything we can to protect our workers,” Ms. Collins said.

The MTA has about 74,000 employees. Some workers say they worry their jobs expose them to the virus. They spend their days close to the public, driving buses, directing passengers and checking tickets. Others work close to colleagues, sharing vehicles, office spaces and desks.


MTA officials sought to allay worker concerns Thursday by live-streaming an information session for employees in which officials read and answered their questions.


Employees wanted to know what the MTA is doing to protect workers with underlying medical conditions. They also asked how they could practice social distancing in jobs that require close contact with colleagues or the public.

Mr. Warren said some workers’ jobs didn’t lend themselves to social distancing, so they should focus on washing their hands. Employees with underlying medical conditions, he said, should seek guidance from their doctors and from the MTA’s human-resources department.

Throughout the week, workers including Trevor Logan, a subway train operator, received calls to stay home because colleagues displayed symptoms, according to several transit workers.

Mr. Logan said he was preparing to go to work Monday when an MTA health worker called to say he should quarantine himself for 14 days because a colleague had displayed symptoms.


“It was literally like a cold feeling came over my body,” said Mr. Logan, who is 39 years old. He said Thursday that he can’t get tested because he hasn’t developed virus-like symptoms.


Some MTA workers who might have come in contact with an infected colleague said they weren’t told where or when they may have been exposed. Tramell Thompson, a subway conductor, said that has led to rumors among staff about possible cases across the system, including in train yards and bus depots, such as the Fresh Pond Depot in Queens.

Thursday evening, an MTA official said three employees at the depot were thought to have tested positive for the virus earlier in the week. Ken Lovett, a spokesman, said 34 people who may have been in contact with the infected workers have been told to self-quarantine.


The MTA continues to run at full service, even as ridership on its subway, buses and commuter railroads has fallen by two-thirds or more since the outbreak of the virus. 

MTA Chairman and Chief Executive Patrick Foye has said service could be reduced as ridership drops further. But he said the system must keep moving so police officers, health-care professionals and others can get to work.


Some smaller mass-transit agencies have taken measures to reduce workers’ interaction with the public, such as stopping ticket checks, switching to rear-door boarding on buses or by dropping fares altogether. The MTA, which expects to lose almost $4 billion this year because of reduced ridership, continues to collect fares, but it has placed signs on express buses asking riders not to occupy the seat adjacent to the driver. It also has stopped accepting cash on its commuter-rail lines.”"

As a stupid comparison, what if I told you 80% of lottery winners were under 40? That wouldn't mean being under 40 gives you an 80% chance of winning the lottery.

We already have decent statistics on the real question, which is, what are the odds of you dying if you catch coronavirus and you're under 40. And it's not zero, so anyone saying ""it only kills old people"" is totally wrong and should not be using the word ""only.""

However the real question is how to contextualize the statistic. The mortality rate I've seen is somewhere around 0.2%. That's 1/500. That is *insane* for the age group. The chance of a person dying any given year between 25 and 34 in the UK is 1/1600. In other words, if you catch coronavirus in that age range, your risk of death just went up by over 400%, and that's compared to *all other causes of death* like car accidents *in an entire year*.

Let's also be real here, that means the odds of you dying from coronavirus if you get it is about the same as you dying at all in the next four years of your life. Add in the skew towards the immunocompromised, it might be even less scary. You also could not catch coronavirus at all.

Don't read my post as telling you you're going to die, and don't read my post as telling you you won't. Jus think about that 1/500 chance and try to live your life as deliberately as you can, with or without catching coronavirus."

Trump can actually win a very large number of people over to his re-election if he can handle this crisis correctly and puts his preference for crony capitalism aside for a few months.

I also approve of how he talked past our lumbering FDA today and talked up chloroquine. He also invoked the Defense Production act yesterday, to make masks & other supplies and hospital ships available for this crisis. We're also going to face massive shortages of drugs like chloroquine, for which we don't have a national supply, and the Defense Production Act could mobilize the production of it.

If he manages to get things right and not look corrupt in this crisis, Trump could create a legacy for his presidential record and get re-elected, with just a few weeks' worth of work. This coronavirus and its impact cuts across party lines and that means that he can turn his approval around with practically anyone.

After testing positive with the pneumonia-causing virus on March 4, the 57-year-old man from Gamagori, Aichi Prefecture, went to the pub in the city that evening despite a request by health officials that he stay home. Local authorities said they did not have the power to prohibit him from going out.


Police launched an investigation into the man, whose identity has not been released, last Friday after a woman in her 30s working at the pub tested positive for the virus that causes COVID-19. The woman’s nationality has not been disclosed.

The police had planned to question him on suspicion of obstruction of business after he left the hospital, to which he was admitted March 5.

The man stayed at the pub for about 40 minutes after spending 15 minutes at an izakaya bar, according to Gamagori municipal officials.

At the Filipino pub, the man sang karaoke and put his arm around a female employee who was serving him, a source said.

Although the female employee tested negative for the virus, another female worker developed a fever March 8 and later tested positive, Toyota municipal officials said last Thursday. The woman lives with her family in the city.

Both the izakaya and the Filipino pub temporarily suspended business from March 4, with the pub manager filing a damage report to authorities last Friday.

The man had tested positive for the virus a day after his parents, with whom he lived, were found to be infected. He had serious pre-existing conditions, sources close to the matter said.

They just *set a brand new record* in the history of the US for profit sharing with their employees just before the coronavirus outbreak, and over the last 5 years has shared over $6 billion in profits with its workers:

https://news.delta.com/following-16b-profit-sharing-payout-delta-unveils-thank-you-plane-featuring-all-90000-employee-0

Delta also gave a paid day of leave to its employees to go out and do community service, and also spent $1 billion investing in sustainability endeavors.  I mean, by almost all metrics, Delta is a pretty damn good role model of a company.  They made lots of profits and shared the wealth with everyone and have done so for years.  They're simply getting destroyed by a once in a century black swan event absolutely NO company could have prepared for.  It wasn't like Delta was poorly run either.  They had lots of profits and a healthy balance sheet, but no company can survive going from having a smash up business to 70% decrease in demand for your product overnight because of a few strands of RNA.  

I'm really not that outraged if a company like Delta, which has long treated everyone from its employees to its investors well, needs a bailout to tide them over so that they can survive. The term 'bailout' is also poor, because it'd likely come in the form of temporary bridging loans anyway.  The government would get paid back with interest.  People who rage over the auto bailouts almost never mention the end result - and that is the fact that US taxpayers actually profited to the tune of billions of dollars once the loans got paid back from the auto bailouts.

I have no idea why so many Americans *want* a good, socially responsible homegrown company like Delta to fail.  The airline industry employs upwards of 20,000,000 people both directly and indirectly.  Keeping a good company like Delta afloat is providing relief to individuals anyway by allowing them to keep their jobs.  I have a feeling people rage at companies before doing any type of research on how they're actually run and behave."

I know this boat well, fortunately for you, some elements of what a Biden Administration could bring doesn't even require new legislation.  It sounds to me like you were on Medicaid, and then kicked off because of a state or federal policy change or crackdown.  Replacing the Trump Administration will likely result in a change in the harsher executive policies and rulemaking of the Trump Administration.  We'll see similar changes in the other Departments as well, and have seen it with every administration change, so there is every reason to believe we will see it again.

>his lack of a housing plan

Honestly, he has one of the most robust housing plans I've seen.  Subsidizing housing and utilities to 30% of income is massive.

[https://joebiden.com/housing/](https://joebiden.com/housing/)

>I've got no reason to believe he's gonna get kids out of cages

This is where we circle back around to policy and rulemaking, yes the Obama administration created the framework that Trump used for his massive expansion.  ""Kids-in-cages"" is a short and evocative phrasing to cover the entirety of the Trump child-separation fiasco.  Yes, the Obama Administration did use chain-link holding areas to keep people for no more than 72 hours while finding placement for people pending asylum claims or trial.  In the case of child separation, no administration had a systematic process for separating children or indefinite detention of migrants until the Trump Administration's ""zero tolerance"" policy in 2018.  ([https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2019/06/23/trump-falsely-says-obama-started-family-separation/1540733001/](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2019/06/23/trump-falsely-says-obama-started-family-separation/1540733001/)) Were there some separations in the past, yes, several administrations separated in cases of suspected human trafficking, and only pending investigation.  The Trump Administration has taken that excuse and run with it ""Oh you are their aunt, and there parents were murdered by the cartels?  Separate!""  The cruelty is the point, which while there are problems in past administrations, it hasn't been like this before.

>putting an end to a war that's been happening since I was 2 years old because he's supported both those things

>My grandmother has to work to afford to live still, and she's over 75 years old with serious respiratory issues and while I'm scared shitless for her because of this virus, Trump's response has actually been good policy wise

Trump's response is exactly why I am scared for my 85 year old grandmother.  It has left the country vulnerable, and more of our citizens at risk.  I heavily support the stimulus, but no amount of money will lead to me forgiving him for the danger he has placed us all under through his sheer self-interest, hubris and negligence.

“In a secret recording obtained by NPR, North Carolina Sen. Richard Burr is heard giving attendees of a club luncheon a much different message than most federal government officials, especially President Trump, were giving the public at the time.


“There’s one thing that I can tell you about this,” Burr said, “It is much more aggressive in its transmission than anything that we have seen in recent history.” He added, “It is probably more akin to the 1918 pandemic.”


That pandemic claimed more than 600,000 American lives. While Burr’s public comments about the coronavirus at the time were rather tame, he provided facts about the dire reality of the virus to members of the Capitol Hill Club, a North Carolina group that consists of heads of businesses and organizations. According to federal records cited by NPR, the companies represented at the luncheon donated more than $100,000 to Burr’s election campaign in 2015 and 2016.


Burr warned the business leaders about effects on travel 13 days before the State Department released info on restrictions and 15 days before the Trump administration banned European travelers.


On Wednesday, the president was asked about the well-connected getting to the front of the line in regard to getting coronavirus tests, and Trump again said the quiet part out loud, casually remarking, “Perhaps that’s been the story of life.”


—

Trump knew. The entire administration knew. They have purposely sabotaged our economy by lying about the severity of the virus. They have sabotaged our healthcare system by auctioning off PALLETS of N95’s just three weeks ago, knowing there’d be a shortage. And now, they are pushing a bill through Congress that threatens end-to-end-encryption and casually mentioning Martial Law, which would allow the government to arrest and imprison citizens without a trial.

I was explaining to a work colleague today who doesn't think the coronavirus is big deal that we are actually in the calm before the storm.

He thought I was being ridiculous and said there's only  200,000 cases and ""not that many people have died"". I explained to him that he means 200,000 confirmed cases of people who felt bad enough symptoms to get a diagnosis. In really there's at least 5-10 times more people infected.

It's ""not a big deal"" yet because there's ""only"" 200,000 case. It ONLY spread from one place to the entire globe in 3 months. 

Hospitals can CURRENTLY handle things but 40%+ of people require oxygen and 2% require intubation.

What does he thing is going to happen when ""a few"" more people get sick and the hospitals and medical supply companies can't cope.

I told him it'll be  1.5 - 2 years before before a proper vaccine can be created a distributed.

Quote from Marc Lipsitch, professor of epidemiology at Harvard (March 11):

""I \[now believe\] 20% to 60% of adults are likely to get infected throughout the epidemic, instead of 40% to 70%, as I said earlier. All these numbers obviously are quite uncertain. Both of those are large ranges, and they’re different large ranges. The reason why I reduced what I was saying is that early estimates of the contagiousness or the basic reproductive number were around 2.2 or a little higher, and more recent estimates seem to be a little bit under 2.""

2020-03-19,Drkaboomer,WWU,9,https://www.reddit.com/r/WWU/comments/fliidc/update_all_classes_online_spring_quarter/fkz0wut/,"""Dear Campus Community:

Today we are announcing that all classes and instruction will be offered remotely throughout spring quarter on our main campus, and at all centers, facilities and operations statewide. As announced previously, spring quarter classes are starting on Monday, April 6, and the quarter is expected to end as scheduled after final exams conclude on June 12, 2020.

As nationwide social distancing requirements continue to increase and evolve daily, we believe this is the best course of action for reducing uncertainty and allaying some anxiety, while establishing a reliable and safe method of instruction and academic progress for Western’s students.

Another message will be forthcoming this afternoon for faculty and staff in Academic Affairs from the Provost and faculty leadership that details new norms for teaching and learning remotely. The scheduled first week of spring quarter (March 30-April 3), will be a week of preparation and transition for students and faculty alike. Faculty are encouraged to communicate with students, via Canvas, about their courses during this week so that students have a sense of what to expect.

Please know that our faculty, staff and student affairs leadership are here to help you both with your continued academic success and with new ways to engage in this unusual time in your Western education. I have been greatly impressed by the many ways in which our faculty and staff are preparing for this quarter with a spirit of innovation and exploration. We fully expect that active learning, research, and the great variety of programs and offerings that Western is known for will continue online with the same creativity and commitment to quality that they do in person.

Families are likely to have questions about changes to fees, given the changes in our operations. We are currently reviewing all fees and will provide complete information about appropriate changes before March 25. Please know that financial aid disbursements will happen on schedule on March 31 as well.

We expect that most students who returned home prior to spring break will remain there, a decision we appreciate and encourage. Housing and Dining Services will send additional information directly to all students who currently have housing agreements with Western.

If you need to return to campus to retrieve your personal possessions, we will provide ample time to ensure you have a smooth and safe transition, and to help this process, the main Bellingham campus is moving to open parking through April 26.

Our residence halls and limited dining delivery and pick up service, which comply with Governor Inslee’s directives, remain available to students who need to reside on campus. Again, more information will be sent directly to all students who currently have housing agreements with the university.

For those who live on or near campus and wish to access campus services, modified operations will be in place. As previously announced, most public buildings will remain closed by order of the Governor and will remain so as long as the order stays in effect. We encourage all employees who can perform their work remotely to continue to do so. Those essential student support services that remain open for face-to-face services will have limited operations that minimize in-person interaction. Many student services, including Academic Advising, Counseling Services, Career Services, and others, are moving to online approaches and outreach, and will work with students throughout the quarter.

These decisions are significant and will have important consequences. We regret having to take these steps and appreciate your understanding as we follow public health directives and guidance to protect the health and well-being of our students, faculty, staff, and our neighbors.

I know these disruptions are not easy, and I am grateful for the sacrifice you are making for the greater good of our shared community. Please remember that social distancing does not mean social isolation. I encourage you to reach out and stay connected, and we will do our best to communicate regularly throughout this health crisis. I take comfort in the fact that we will come through this more resilient and more connected than ever.

Please be well,

Sabah Randhawa

President

 

The Incident Command System team at Western has established three goals for all of our preparation and response to COVID-19:  to protect life safety and minimize the spread of the coronavirus illness, to maintain – as much as possible – the continuity of Western’s operations, and to communicate with our communities as fully as possible.

Western's coronavirus information website features Frequently Asked Questions; has links to campus, regional and national resources; an archive of campus messaging and media stories about coronavirus; a new toll-free campus coronavirus information line, and more. The site is a living document, and will get frequent updates as the coronavirus situation evolves."""

2020-03-19,Spoggerific,japanlife,8,https://www.reddit.com/r/japanlife/comments/fk1lvp/japanlife_coronavirus_megathread_ii/fkwodoo/,"I am an American living in Tokyo. I speak Japanese fluently, and all of the following interactions have been with Japanese doctors in Japanese.

I've had the following symptoms, in rough order, since the 4th of March:

* Headache
* Throat pain
* Fatigue
* Dry cough
* Chest pain
* Difficulty breathing
* Low SpO2 (sometimes as low as 85%)

These are all the exact symptoms of coronavirus, minus a fever. They come and go; sometimes I feel almost OK, but sometimes it's also so bad that I can barely walk. The highest my temperature has been is 37.2 degrees; it *feels* like I have a fever, but the thermometer doesn't show that. I am 30 years old with a childhood history of asthma.

I went to a heart specialist on the 7th, since I thought it could have been a heart thing and I've been told I may have arrhythmia before. An EKG and ultrasound revealed nothing, so I went home with no medication.  
On the 9th I went to a standard clinic, and had a chest X-ray and asthma test taken. Neither showed any irregularities. At this point I was starting to worry this may be the coronavirus, and when I asked the doctor about it he told me that it was likely just a cold. I got some painkillers and a cough suppressant and was sent on my way.  
The same day, I called the Japanese coronavirus hotline, and was told that I likely don't have coronavirus because I don't have a high enough fever.

I called a clinic on the 12th and was told they didn't have any machines to do X-rays or similar tests, and to go to a large hospital. I called up a hospital on the 13th, and explained my symptoms on the phone (without mentioning coronavirus), and they told me to come in. When I got there, I was placed in a separate room and was told that they will be unable to see me because I am displaying coronavirus symptoms. When I explained that the hotline told me to go to a hospital, they just told me to call the hotline again. I wasn't able to get tested because they said I don't have the virus, but I also wasn't able to get medical treatment because I might have the coronavirus.

On the 14th I went back to the clinic where I had the X-ray taken, and had a letter of introduction to another hospital written. I went to that hospital, and had blood taken, another EKG, another X-ray, and another asthma test. I spoke to my doctor about possibly having coronavirus again, and that it's likely not a good idea for me to wait in the waiting room with dozens of old people around me. I was told once again that it's unlikely that I have coronavirus. A second appointment was set up on the 21st. My symptoms were relatively light at the time I went to the hospital, but I have been taking a picture of my SpO2 monitor every time it showed below 95% (a few dozen times). The doctor dismissed those as a poorly applied or calibrated meter.  
I went back on the 16th, due to my symptoms getting significantly worse over Sunday. The blood test results were in, and they showed nothing unusual. My symptoms were a little bit worse than on the 14th, so the doctor had another EKG and a heart ultrasound taken. Neither showed anything unusual, so I was scheduled to have a holter monitor (take-home 24 hour EKG) attached, which was done so on the 17th and returned yesterday, on the 18th. I spoke to a second doctor at the hospital and was told the same thing; that I don't have coronavirus and that it's likely a cold.  

My next appointment is on the 6th of April, but my condition continues to worsen, and my wife (32 years old) is starting to show symptoms as well. I have been taking off work ever since my symptoms started, but my wife absolutely refuses to take off work no matter how much I beg her.  
I have called every single hotline and phone number I can think of; every single one has told me that I don't have a high enough fever, and that there is no possibility I have coronavirus. I've tried explaining to them that I may be spreading it to the most vulnerable part of the population when I go to the hospital, but they still tell me that I don't have it and that I just need to talk to a doctor. I've even called the US Embassy, who told me to just see a doctor in Japan.

What the fuck do I *do*? My breathing is getting bad enough sometimes that I feel like I might need to call an ambulance, but no one, not even my own wife is taking me seriously."

I’m worried for all the elderly who have these underlying conditions and keep downplaying the severity of their ability to contract it and thus will suffer or even die. How can so many people be misinformed?
From what I’ve read from local stories, articles and local redditors, this virus is most likely more widespread than we know. 
Be safe out there everybody, and LAVATE LAS MANOS!"

Most of its members are women and many are in their 20s and 30s.""

1. The Democrats pick somebody else in a surprise move at the convention after Biden wins the first round but then withdraws. This person is seen as an acceptable compromise and against the backdrop of coronavirus and the Second Depression easily beats Trump.

2. Biden loses to Trump in a fucking landslide. Trump enacts fully fascist national socialism before and after the election, with a UBI and Medicare for all and nationalized industries but entirely with racist and fascist implementation. 

And what I think is most likely

3. Military dictatorship in a month or two here, headed by the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs, after Congress gives them emergency powers to resolve the crisis which wind up also giving them executive power. Federal elections are postponed indefinitely. People are more or less okay with it because General Milley is better than Trump or Biden and the military is fully mobilized to distribute supplies and build emergency hospitals."

**Waterloo Region –** Across Waterloo Region and Ontario, waste collection crews are still out on the streets, picking up green bins, blue boxes and garbage. Their efforts on behalf of our community are appreciated more than ever during this time, and we all want to keep them healthy while working. While crews have their own health and safety procedures in place, they have asked that we please take these extra steps to help protect them on the job. 

* Please place used tissues and napkins in the garbage, rather than the green bin.
* Please use liner bags (either paper or certified compostable plastic) in the green bin.
* Put all garbage in garbage bags, not loose in garbage cans.
* If you are sick, please place any item that has come into contact with your mouth, nose or eyes into the garbage. This includes items you would normally put in the blue box, such as water bottles, pop cans, milk/juice cartons, etc. 

These steps will help protect the health of crews who handle thousands of bins, bags and boxes each week. We all have a role to play and by working together, we can make a difference. 

Reporting of curbside waste collection issues is best done through the Region’s [online complaint form](https://myforms.regionofwaterloo.ca/form/auto/hrc_wastecomplain) (visit www.regionofwaterloo.ca/waste and click on Report a Collection Issue).

And that's ESPECIALLY important because multiple Chinese government officials (and even a Chinese infectious disease expert) are spreading a conspiracy theory that the virus was introduced to China by the US.  ([source](https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/13/asia/china-coronavirus-us-lijian-zhao-intl-hnk/index.html))

We know that China's live animal markets were the source of the original SARS outbreak in 2002/2003. ([source](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/biochemistry-genetics-and-molecular-biology/sars-coronavirus))  And after this, China ostensibly tightened restrictions on these markets... but over time the rules were relaxed and ignored, to the point that massive live animal markets could operate openly in some of the country's biggest cities.

Unfortunately, the world failed to hold the Chinese government accountable for its failure to maintain a high standard of health security for its citizens, and that failure has led to the horrifying consequences that you see today in SARS-CoV-2.  And worse, rather than have a system set up to at least attempt to catch the next SARS-like virus, reports of the first cases in November of 2019 were either ignored or suppressed. ([source](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/13/first-covid-19-case-happened-in-november-china-government-records-show-report))  And STILL worse, the first whislteblowers who *did* realize that a new SARS-like virus may have appeared were harassed by police for ""making false comments on the Internet"" and forced to sign a document saying he would stop talking about it. ([source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Li_Wenliang))  For this reason, it is important that we hold the Chinese government accountable for their failures, even to the point of reminding the world that responsibility for this pandemic rests largely on the shoulders of the CCP.

It would be more accurate to call it ""the Chinese Communist Party's virus"", but that just doesn't roll off the tongue quite as well."

Yes, in theory you could collect your own mouth swabs but you would need to send them in, because the current test is based on detecting the genetics of the virus by a polymerase chain reaction that uses coronavirus-matching molecules and other reagents to amplify fragments of the virus genome (accelerate its replication) for detection through a series of cycles (e.g. 30) that typically alternate between 95 celsius to 55-65 celsius to 75 celsius. In summary, this is a real-time reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction \[aka real-time RT-PCR\] that includes short sequences of DNA (primers and probes) that bind exclusively to SARS-CoV-2 matching sequence and give off, once bound, a detectable fluorescent signal whose brightness matches the number of binding events aka virus fragments. Although the [test parameters are now open access](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-nCoV/lab/index.html) you would need this fancy real-time PCR machine plus a centrifuge plus a biosafety cabinet...

The good news is that many folks are working on different kinds of tests, maybe even a protein-based test that could be bundled into a system like a pregnancy test kit, and you could use this RAPID test kit at home...

Normal microscopes won't help because viruses are too small to reflect light (this coronavirus, if it is like others in the family Coronaviridae, is probably on the order of 120 nanometers \[a nanometer is a billionth of a meter in diameter) - you need to use an electron microscope that fires electrons at the virus and reads their reflections."

Governor Naomichi Suzuki told reporters on Wednesday that the three-week emergency period will expire on the following day as planned. He announced the declaration on February 28.

Suzuki said he believes Hokkaido has avoided an explosive spread of infection that people feared would result in a collapse of medical services.

He called on people to refrain from going out if they are concerned about infection.

The governor stressed the need for the prefecture to establish a model of balancing efforts to contain the infection with social and economic activities.

He also expressed his intention to continue preparations for the marathon and race walk events of the 2020 Tokyo Olympics. They are scheduled to be held in the northern prefecture."

Ciudad de México. Al día de hoy se confirmaron 118 casos del coronavirus Covid-19, de acuerdo con el reporte oficial dado a conocer en Palacio Nacional. No incluye el informe sobre la que es la primera muerte de una persona por causa de la infección, la cual fue confirmada a La Jornada por fuentes del gabinete de salud. Es un hombre de 41 años sin antecedentes de viaje a alguno de los sitios donde circula el virus, se encontraba hospitalizado en el Instituto Nacional de Enfermedades Respiratorias (INER).

Además, hay otra persona internada en el hospital Bité Médica de Santa Fe, también masculino de 40 años, con Covid-19, intubado y en terapia intensiva. Tampoco tiene antecedentes de viaje y un dato relevante es que estuvo el fin de semana pasado en el festival Vive Latino.

El gobierno de la Ciudad de México rechazó esta versión y afirmó que hay un hombre, también caso confirmado del nuevo coronavirus, de 40 años, que tampoco cumple con los datos de haber salido del país. Está en el Hospital ABC de Santa Fé. Esta persona estuvo en el concierto de Ghost el pasado 3 de marzo en el Palacio de los Deportes. 

El pasado fin de semana se encontraba aislado en su domicilio particular y luego ingresó al nosocomio. El reporte médico indica que “está en franca mejoría”."

TLDR: The restaurant I work for has multiple employees serving food while showing signs of coronavirus and I believe the only way to stop it is for people to stop ordering out

I work for a popular restaurant here in Houston. Just like all other restaurants in Harris County, we were ordered to switch to carryout and delivery orders only. The influx in delivery orders has meant that we only had to scale back slightly on staff. We basically still need all hands on deck. We currently have multiple employees coming to work sick with symptoms consistent with Covid-19. However, if any of them were to call in sick, they fear they would be fired.

I'm not going to name the restaurant I work for, because frankly, it doesn't matter. Most restaurants operate this way. They schedule the bare minimum amount of staff needed for a shift. If someone is unable to work that shift, they face disciplinary action if they don't find another worker to cover the shift for them. If they can't, they're also made to feel guilty that they're letting their coworkers down. They're often times not allowed to return to work without a doctor's note, even if the illness doesn't warrant a visit to the doctor. Plus, many (dare I say most) service workers are uninsured, making a trip to the doctor nearly impossible. Restaurants don't provide them with any medical benefits, yet expect them to visit a doctor if they feel they need even a single day off to recover from a common cold. This is a common way restaurants terminate employees for calling in sick. By just not allowing them back because they failed to see a doctor.

This attitude has been ingrained in service workers. You come to work no matter what. I'm used to seeing service workers grind their way through shifts, visibly ill, with no complaints. I'm used to contracting an illness as a result of this and also grinding through it just to pass it on to other coworkers who will then in turn grind through it as well.

However, it's different this time. Multiple staff members have alerted management that they're feeling extremely unwell. Management has instructed them to drink water, take a short break, and take OTC medication. All of these people handle food directly. Thus far, no one has been sent home.

This won't change. As long as you keep giving these restaurants the incentive they need to stay open, they won't ever care about the cost. If their entire staff gets sick, they'll just hire a new one. If you, the consumer, get sick, you're replaceable too.

You may think you're helping with all this ""non-contact delivery"" but you're not. It's a scam made up by the restaurants and delivery services to avoid taking too big of a hit to the bottom line. The only way to stop this virus from spreading is to keep anyone that's sick at home. I know we've all gotten a million corporate emails about how restaurants are handling Covid-19, but I promise you they're all bullshit. No one is allowed to stay home. Stop ordering takeout until the restaurants are forced to close.

Stay safe, Houston!"
