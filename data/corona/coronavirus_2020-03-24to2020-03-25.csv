By The Associated Press
March 24, 2020, 9:22 a.m. ET

MAPUTO, Mozambique — More than 60 undocumented migrants believed to be Ethiopians were found dead in a cargo truck in northwestern Mozambique on Tuesday.

The truck, which had entered Mozambique from the neighboring country of Malawi, was stopped at a checkpoint in Moatize, near the Zambezi River in Tete Province, according to the online site Zitamar News.

According to the authorities, the driver was ordered to open the truck when officials heard bashing noises coming from the container, and 14 survivors were also found inside. The victims were said to have died from a lack of oxygen.

The survivors will be screened for the coronavirus and put into quarantine, health officials told reporters. 
Mozambique is a transit route for African migrants trying to reach South Africa, one of the continent’s largest economies, according to the International Office on Migration, a United Nations body.

At least 200 unauthorized migrants, mostly from Egypt, Ethiopia, Malawi and Somalia, have been arrested on suspicion of attempting to enter Tete Province this year, and all indicated that their destination was South Africa, according to Zitamar.

Migrants fleeing poverty or war in troubled areas of the world face perilous, and often deadly, journeys in search of a better life. Some are forced to take dangerous sea crossings; others are herded into vehicles to make arduous overland trips.

In southeastern England last year, 39 bodies were found in a refrigerated truck container abandoned in an industrial park. The police in that case confirmed that all the victims — who were believed to have been transported to Britain through a global human-trafficking network — were from Vietnam.

And in August 2015, police officers in Austria found the decomposing bodies of 71 migrants who had been locked in a truck and left by the side of a road."
2020-03-24,kegel_dialectic,Coronavirus,36,https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/fofdw6/why_germanys_coronavirus_death_rate_is_so_much/fleujw5/,"> BERLIN — For weeks, virologists here have been asked a persistent question: Why, compared to other countries, are so few of the Germans who are diagnosed with the coronavirus dying?

> In Italy, 9.5 percent of the people who have tested positive for the virus have succumbed to covid-19, according to data compiled at Johns Hopkins University. In France, the rate is 4.3 percent. But in Germany, it’s 0.4 percent.

> The biggest reason for the difference, infectious disease experts say, is Germany’s work in the early days of its outbreak to track, test and contain infection clusters. That means Germany has a truer picture of the size of its outbreak than places that test only the obviously symptomatic, most seriously ill or highest-risk patients.

> Merkel says coronavirus presents gravest crisis since WWII

> “At the beginning, when we had relatively few cases, when it came to finding them and isolating them, we did quite well in Germany,” said Reinhard Busse, head of the department of health care management at the Berlin University of Technology. “That’s the major reason.”

> Other factors, such as the age of those infected and the timing of Germany’s outbreak, also play a role in the differing death rates. But testing widely has been key. Germany, with 31,150 cases at midday Tuesday, appeared to have a larger outbreak than France, with 20,149. But the higher death rate in France implies there were more undiagnosed cases there. France’s outbreak could be larger than Germany’s.

> Germany has not carried out mass testing of the kind employed in countries such as South Korea. But initially, at least, the country’s health authorities tracked infection clusters meticulously. When an individual tested positive, they used contact tracing to find other people with whom they had been in touch and then tested and quarantined them, which broke infection chains.

>Christian Drosten, a virologist at the Charité hospital in Berlin, said he’s “firmly convinced” that Germany’s high diagnostic capacity had “secured us an extreme lead . . . in the detection of the epidemic.”

> But he cautioned against complacency, and said the death rate would increase: “We are no exception.”

> Epidemiologists say it’s important to look at Germany’s outbreak in two distinct phases. As community spread became prevalent, infection chains in some cases became impossible to trace. Some doctors said they had no choice but to send people seeking tests back home to call jammed coronavirus hotlines because they lacked protective equipment to conduct them safely.

> With cases growing exponentially, health authorities have moved on to ordering social distancing and banning mass events. Federal states have restricted gatherings outside the home to a maximum of two people.

> South Korea, which has been praised as a model for responding to the outbreak, has a death rate of 1.2 percent. Busse credits Germany’s lower rate to timing.

> “In South Korea, there’s been a longer duration of infections, so we can’t really compare,” he said. “We have lots of newly positive cases. They didn’t have the chance to die yet.”

> Busse said Germany is more comparable to Norway. The Scandinavian country is at a similar point in its outbreak, it’s also worked to test and contain cases, and it also has a death rate of 0.4 percent.

> Whether Germany’s distancing measures will “flatten the curve” is not yet clear. Lothar Wieler, president of the federal agency responsible for disease control, was hopeful Monday that a period of exponential growth might be slowing, but cautioned that it was too early to say, given fluctuations in data. He said the picture should be clearer by Wednesday.

> Germany’s initial testing criteria were no wider than Italy’s. People were tested if they had symptoms and had been to a risk area, or if they had contact with a confirmed case. But many initial cases had clear links to overseas travel.

> The guidelines have since been expanded and testing has been boosted in recent weeks. The number tested jumped from 35,000 in the first week of March to 100,000 in the second, according to Germany’s medical association. The estimates don’t include tests conducted inside hospitals.

> Epidemiologist Karl Lauterbach, a member of the German parliament, noted that the German outbreak started with large numbers of young people — “people who came back from holidays.”

> The young have fared better with the coronavirus than the elderly. Italy’s initial outbreak struck at the heart of an aging population. Lauterbach said he expected Germany’s death rate to rise as more vulnerable segments of society are infected.

> Because testing is not universal, and many people with the coronavirus might never be diagnosed, a true death rate is impossible to ascertain. But experts say the rate is likely to be significantly higher in countries such as Spain and Italy, where care is collapsing.

> With more intensive care beds and ventilators than most other European nations and early measures to prevent the spread of the virus, Lauterbach said, he didn’t see Germany turning into Italy or Spain. Still, he has been advocating for wider restrictions.

> “I think with all things considered, Germany will do reasonably well in this first round of a long fight,” he said."

He’s supposed to be buying his own ventilators.”

It contained very little actual help for individuals whose livelihoods were affected but not in a way that allowed them to collect unemployment. (Gig economy workers, restaurant workers, white collar workers who aren't being fired but also aren't being allowed to work from home, etc )

The democrats are trying to get more money for individuals, including more and bigger cash payments instead of simply expanding unemployment which does nothing for those aforementioned workers. They are trying to get the stimulus to provide funds for guaranteeing paid sick leave for first responders and medical professionals, whom the Republicans wanted to allow their employers to force them to come into work sick and infect their patients or lose their income.  They are also seeking oversight for corporations so they don't use the money simply for stock buybacks, which *is exactly why we are in this situation where billion dollar corporations can't afford to shut down for a few weeks in the first place!* They are trying to prevent taking funds from the payroll tax, which is a blatant republican attempt to cut social security and Medicaid...yet again.

It certainly shows that for many investors, the bull market mentality certainly hasn't been killed by the Coronavirus. However, as a physician, I would advise all my brethren TSLA investors to proceed with caution.

The general public does not know the hell that awaits us in the next few weeks. Most healthcare workers are in a hopeless panic, prepared as if it were wartime. Dentists, outpatient physicians, and even retired health care workers are already being asked to sign up to volunteer if called upon. The PPE shortage is very real - last week we received an email from the CDC to suggest using a bandana to cover our face if there are no masks...palpable desperation.

We all want to get back to normal life. Trust me. However, short of a medical miracle, I sincerely doubt everyone will be back to normal life by Trump's Easter proposal. If they can ramp testing to a point where we can verify that people are negative for the Coronavirus, provide them with PPE for extras precaution, then I absolutely do agree with sending low-risk employees back to work (keep high-risk people at home, regardless of test result).

Ideally, a fine balance exists between shutting our economy down and playing out the situation from the movie Contagion. Neither option is acceptable.

Tread with caution in the coming weeks. At least from a medical standpoint, we've barely begun. Whether or not that corresponds with the market is yet to be seen.

Be safe all.

It's because 1, the person saying it is all ""go red team!"" and cares nothing about anything but picking a side, 2, because the person just wants to say ""libs mad"" and be edgy, or 3, they are stupid and don't realize that the phrase doesn't damage the Communist Party  of China, or 4, they're racist.

>	FRANKFORT, Ky. — “This is one that makes me mad.”

Kentucky Governor Andy Beshear revealed his disappointment Tuesday after revealing one of the patients who tested positive for COVID-19 attended a “coronavirus party.”

“Anyone who goes to something like this, may think that they are indestructible but it’s someone else’s loved one that they are going to hurt,” Gov. Beshear said. “We are battling for the lives of our parents and our grandparents. Don’t be so callous as to intentionally go to something and expose yourself to something that could kill other people.”

 
The governor didn’t give specifics on where the party took place but later elaborated, saying it was a group of young adults in their 20’s flaunting the gatherings. He said these gatherings must stop immediately. 

“Don’t simply fight to be the exception of the rule,” he stressed.

Beshear continued to stress the importance of flattening the curve of coronavirus by social distancing.

So far, Kentucky has 39 new cases, bringing the statewide total 163."

First he makes a controversial statement (shutdown needs to end, its not worth preventing coronavirus deaths). He justifies this controversial statement with a “fact” or number (there will be suicides by the thousands if the shutdown continues). He provides no evidence or source for his “factual” justification. 

Now we debate this “fact” instead of the controversial statement. We ask “is it worth saving the elderly from the coronavirus if the economy tanks AND we have all these suicides? We ask what he’s even talking about, where did this “suicides by the thousands” number come from? 

If the president is incapable of providing sources for his claims we shouldn’t bother to consider them at all.

>Good evening.

>Since when we rescued our brothers in Wuhan, China, in an operation coordinated by the ministries of defense and foreign affairs, the yellow light has come to us. We started to prepare to face the coronavirus, because we knew that sooner or later it would arrive in Brazil.

>Our health minister met with almost all health secretaries in the states so that the strategic plan for fighting the virus could be built.

>And ever since, Dr. Henrique Mandetta has been doing an excellent job of clarifying and preparing SUS for the care of possible victims.

>But what we had to contain at that moment was panic, hysteria and, at the same time, devise a strategy to save lives and avoid mass unemployment. We did so, against everything and against everyone.

>Much of the media went against the grain. They spread the feeling of dread exactly, with the announcement of the large number of victims in Italy as their flagship. A country with a large number of elderly people and with a climate totally different from ours. The perfect scenario, enhanced by the media, for a real hysteria to spread throughout our country.

>It can be seen that, from yesterday to today, part of the press has changed its editorial, asking for calm and tranquility. That's really good. Congratulations, Brazilian press. It is essential that common sense and balance prevail among us.

>The virus has arrived, is being faced by us and will soon pass. Our life has to go on. Jobs must be maintained. The livelihood of families must be preserved. We must return to normality.

>A few state and local authorities must abandon the concept of scorched earth, the ban on transportation, the closing of businesses and mass confinement.

>What is happening in the world has shown that the risk group is that of people over 60 years old. Why close schools? Fatal cases of healthy people under the age of 40 are rare. 90% of us will have no manifestation if we get infected.

>What we should do is be extremely concerned about not transmitting the virus to others, especially to our dear parents and grandparents, respecting the guidelines of the Ministry of Health.

>In my particular case, due to my athlete's history, if I was infected with the virus, I wouldn't have to worry. Nothing would feel or would, at most, have a cold or a cold, as that famous doctor from that famous television said.

>While I am speaking, the world is seeking treatment for the disease. The American FDA and Albert Einstein hospital, in São Paulo, are seeking proof of the effectiveness of chloroquine in the treatment of Covid-19. Our government has received positive news about this medicine manufactured in Brazil and widely used to fight malaria, lupus and arthritis.

>I believe in God, who will train scientists and researchers from Brazil and the world to cure this disease. I take this opportunity to pay tribute to all health professionals: doctors, technical nurses and collaborators who receive us at the front lines in hospitals, treat us and comfort us.

>Without panic or hysteria, as I have been talking about since the beginning, we will overcome the virus and be proud to live in this new Brazil that, yes, has everything to be a great nation. We are together, increasingly united.

>God bless our dear homeland."

This isnt a runny nose and some sneezing thing, if you catch the worst of it, you feel like you're choking for air while simultaneously aching all over your body, dehydration, confusion, headaches. 

Most experts and nations expect upwards of 70% of the global population to be infected.

> * Virus expert: As much as 70 percent of world's population could get coronavirus [source](https://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/public-global-health/485602-virus-expert-as-much-as-70-percent-of-worlds)

That is **5.4 Billion** Humans.

Out of those its expected 20-30% will need/seek hospital care and be admitted (CDC Figures).

That means **1.08 Billion - 1.62 Billion** humans will need hospital care. (you can probably add another 20-30% who will go to the hospital seeking care but turned away as they dont need to be admitted and can recover at home)

While between 5-10% will need intensive care. (based on extrapolated data from confirmed cases vs those that get intensive care)

> About 80% of deaths and 45% of hospitalizations for COVID-19 in the U.S. are among adults aged 65 or older, with the risk of serious illness and death increasing with age, according to a report released today by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The findings are similar to data from China, the agency said. While severe COVID-19 illness leading to hospitalization can occur at any age, children appear to have milder illness, with almost no hospitalizations for those under age 19, CDC said. According to the report, an estimated 21% to 31% of U.S. COVID-19 patients between Feb. 12 and March 16 were hospitalized, with 5% to 12% admitted to an intensive care unit. An estimated 1.8% to 3.4% of U.S. COVID-19 patients died over the period. [source](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/69/wr/mm6912e2.htm?s_cid=mm6912e2_e&deliveryName=USCDC_921-DM23064)

thats between **270-540 Million people needing intensive care**.

If this pandemic continues to be disregarded as it is, it will lead to the amount of people infected at the same time growing far beyond the capacity and resources available.

To emphasize lets look at the US statistics.

If we use USA as a example with 70% infection rate, that would mean 230 Million Americans will get the Covid-19 Virus.

Out of the 230 Million, 20-30% will be admitted into hospital care (CDC). 

= **46-70 Million Americans will require Hospital Care.**

Currently the US has only [924,107 staffed hospital beds](https://www.aha.org/statistics/fast-facts-us-hospitals) TOTAL.

and statistics show already the hospitals have a **[occupancy rate of 65%.](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/hus/2017/089.pdf)** 

Meaning that out of the 1M hospital beds, on average, 600,669 Hospital beds will already be in use by other patients for other illnesses and issues. Which leaves only

924,107 - 600,669 = **323,437 available hospital beds.**

Heck if even 1% of those infected require intensive care in the US at the same 2 week period, thats going to be almost 500,000 people needing hospital beds where there are only 300,000 available.

AND to make matters worse, this is all disregarding the amount of hospital workers/suppliers/producers doctors,nurses, emergency responders who will also be affected by Covid-19.

Rich people wont all have access to the same things. They can try to self-isolate on their mansions and such, but this is a very infectious virus, to put it in a simple way. In a normal flu, you have a infection rate of 1.35. Meaning you infect that many people they infect that many people and so on, if you do so for 10 steps, you end up with around under 100 people infected. The Covid 19 virus on the other hand, it has a infection rate of 2.4. Which means by 10 steps you would have upwards of 60,000 infected.

**That is why its important that everyone stay inside so that this virus can go through the world gradually and hopefully minimize the infection rates and eventually be vaccinated against and die off.**

Recommendation from the CDC;

> The risk for serious disease and death in COVID-19 cases among persons in the United States increases with age. Social distancing is recommended for all ages to slow the spread of the virus, protect the health care system, and help protect vulnerable older adults. Further, older adults should maintain adequate supplies of nonperishable foods and at least a 30-day supply of necessary medications, take precautions to keep space between themselves and others, stay away from those who are sick, avoid crowds as much as possible, avoid cruise travel and nonessential air travel, and stay home as much as possible to further reduce the risk of being exposed (7). Persons of all ages and communities can take actions to help slow the spread of COVID-19 and protect older adults.†

The Coronavirus epidemic began in China sometime in Dec 2019. Wuhan in Hubei province, China (population \~11M) imposed a strict lockdown on 23 Jan at around 30 deaths. Keep in mind that this wasn't a lax/laissez faire-style lockdown like cities have been doing here in the U.S., this was a very strict lockdown that most organizations called ""unprecedented"" at the time. The Wuhan lockdown took the following measures:

* All people were confined to their homes
* Only one person from each household was permitted to go outside once every two days except for medical reasons or work at shops & pharmacies
* House to house searches were conducted where temperatures were taken for each household member - sick people were tested and quarantined elsewhere
* All public transport (buses, flights, rail) was prohibited. Highway exits were closed. Travel was also restricted between nearby cities, and most communities, towns, villages only had one route in and out - people entering and leaving were required to wear masks and take temperatures
* Curfews were established and enforced - sometimes during the day
* Residents were often not allowed to leave the city without permission
* Vouchers or proof of need to travel were often required - couriers and food delivery was usually prohibited

The measures started by Wuhan eventually spread throughout other neighboring cities ultimately effecting 57M in 15 other cities. However, even with such stringent actions, China still had over 3100+ deaths, and is just now beginning to ease back on these restrictions (3 months later).

Compare all of this to the response in the U.S. which has been rather lax to say the least. The reality is, the Government downplayed the severity of the virus, and has only taken what some would consider ""partial"" steps to curb the rate of infection. In fact, there is even talk about re-opening our boarders and easing travel restrictions to help improve the economy. As of the time this was posted, the U.S. has an estimated 49,500+ cases w/622 deaths. NY alone has 25,600+ cases with 210 deaths (a population of 8.6M), and some states (NY, CA, WA, LA, GA) now have over 30 deaths (the point at which Wuhan enacted their *strict* lockdown). Keep in mind that the numbers being provided also lag behind ""actual"" figures due to the fact that test results are taking up to a week to return. So in reality, the numbers we see now are roughly 7 days old. And at the rate infections are increasing, we are on-pace to far exceed the numbers from China, Italy, and many of the estimates that were given.

Disclaimer: This post is not intended to worry people, but is intended to provide some insight into the reality of the U.S. response. Also realize that these comparisons are not directly apples-to-apples. There are several other factors that play a role in the data and responses. However, I really don't believe that the U.S. is doing enough to prepare for/curb the wave of infected that is about to hit. If I had to guess, I still think things will continue to get worse before they get better.

Possible motive? President Trump has refused to use a wartime law to require major manufacturers to make vital equipment to combat the new coronavirus, reportedly after corporations successfully lobbied his top adviser and son-in-law, Jared Kushner. [https://www.salon.com/2020/03/24/trump-wont-require-firms-to-help-fight-coronavirus--after-corporations-lobbied-jared-kushner/](https://www.salon.com/2020/03/24/trump-wont-require-firms-to-help-fight-coronavirus--after-corporations-lobbied-jared-kushner/)

Another possible reason: Thus far, the Trump Organization, run by the president’s adult sons, Eric and Donald Trump Jr., have closed properties in Doral, Florida, Las Vegas, Ireland, Scotland, Bedminster, New Jersey, and Palm Beach, Florida, the home of Mar-a-Lago. According to the Post, those hotels and clubs represent six of Trump’s top revenue-producing businesses, bringing in about a collective $174 million per year, or $478,000 per day.

The flip side is that if a Democrat were in office now, the Republican response would be absolutely, unimaginably insane, equal parts ""coronavirus is a hoax to let the feds steal our guns"" and ""the death toll is actually 50% and FEMA is digging mass graves outside of Tucson"".

South Korea has handled the virus without shutting everything down at such an extreme level. Experts tell us 40-80% of us will get it anyway. Tens of millions of people are going to lose their jobs and be unable to pay their bills in order to reduce the stress on the healthcare system.

People who can telework should. Mass gatherings should be banned. We should all be extremely careful, staying 6 feet apart, washing hands, wearing gloves, etc. But shutting down all businesses?

Once he does, and governors follow his request, there will be time to debate how soon some controls might be lifted, or how soon certain people, like those under a particular age, might be free to resume something like normal life.

There will be more time then to develop palliative treatments, and more time for the federal government to order up the test kits and ventilators needed nationwide. There will be more time to gather data about which regions, and which people, are most at risk.

But the United States has passed the point where aggressive, targeted efforts at tracking and containment, like those pursued by South Korea, have a realistic chance of success. And calls for voluntary social distancing have had mixed results, as the photos of spring breakers crammed together on the Florida beaches last week made clear.

We are not suggesting that Mr. Trump has the authority to order a national lockdown, much less advocating that he attempt to enforce one. Instead, we are urging him to use the bully pulpit to put pressure on, and provide political cover for, governors to take the hard steps that are needed.

As the president’s own health advisers warn, the worst of the coronavirus pandemic is yet to come. The nation’s slow and spotty response has allowed the virus to spread to every state. Modeling by researchers at the Imperial College London indicates that upward of two million lives could be lost to the pandemic unless America somehow manages to “flatten the curve.”

Some cities and states, and even entire nations, already have lockdowns in place. On Tuesday, India’s prime minister, Narendra Modi, ordered a “total ban” on leaving home for the population of 1.3 billion, for the next three weeks. He warned, “If you can’t handle these 21 days, this country will go back 21 years.”

Other countries have opted for narrower restrictions, and enforcement has varied. But patchwork approaches, like the one the United States defaulted to in the absence of a national plan, have proven inadequate.

The coronavirus can spread so quickly that to prevent hospitals from being overwhelmed, the restrictions need to be sweeping, they need to be uniform across jurisdictions and they need to be put in place now. It may already be too late for New York, despite the urgent efforts of state and local governments.

Everyone shares Mr. Trump’s concern for the economy. But this is not a moment for mere salesmanship, for conjuring a cheerful vision rather than facing reality. It’s a moment for providing a plan. On Tuesday, Mr. Trump said he’d “love to have the country opened up and just raring to go by Easter,” which falls this year on April 12. Who wouldn’t? But wishing will not make it so. This crisis has not turned a corner — it hasn’t even hit yet.

Rather than raising false expectations of a rapid and full return to business as usual, the president needs to be pursuing even more drastic measures. He should announce that, within 24 hours, all nonessential businesses should be shut and residents directed to remain in their homes except for vital trips out, such as to obtain food or medical care. Provisions can be made for people to walk in outdoor public spaces, so long as they maintain a distance of at least six feet.

**Two weeks from now, with more testing, we will also have a far better sense of where infections are clustered if more people confine their movements to a limited number of places.**

Mr. Trump has proclaimed himself a “war president.” Why, then, won’t he rally Americans around this cause? Winning this war will require shared sacrifice, and tremendous short-term hardship for Americans. But failure would mean devastating loss of life and prolonged, widespread economic pain.

Of course, even extreme social distancing and withdrawal is no panacea. The Trump administration will need to take other steps to stop the spread of this disease.

Lines of authority and policy aims need to be clarified within the White House. Vice President Mike Pence is the official crisis czar, but Jared Kushner, the president’s son-in-law, has his own response team working on, among other things, outreach to the private sector. Certain senior aides, with business leaders whispering in their ears, are at odds with some health advisers about what restrictions are needed and how heavy the government’s hand should be. There has been much grumbling among people both inside and outside the administration that it’s hard to tell who’s running the show. That is complicating decision-making at all levels.

Federalism is integral to American government, but the administration needs to get serious about running a coordinated national response. When Mr. Trump effectively told governors, You’re on your own. Go find your own supplies in the marketplace, he at least gave states greater purchasing flexibility. But he also set up a free-for-all in which states are now bidding against one another — as well as against municipalities, the federal government and other nations — for scarce resources such as protective equipment and ventilators. This causes not only price competition but also misallocation of resources, as each state scrambles to amass its own stockpile, regardless of relative need."""

https://www.statnews.com/2020/01/31/as-far-right-calls-for-china-travel-ban-health-experts-warn-coronavirus-response-would-suffer/

How I remember thing is Trump took a strong action against China. Then Trump started to downplay the serious of the situation in early-mid February. Somewhere down the line democrats started to become more serious about the issue and it evolved to where it is now. 

Now, I want to be clear. I think this is serious and good chance it will kill 250k-1million Americans (possibly more than cancer or heart disease). I also think the initial testing was totally messed up. But honestly there is no western country that has responded to this more effectively than China and maybe South Korea. So I really wonder how different the situation would be with another administration. 

In general, Trump response has fluctuated. On one hand, this seems inconsistent/confusing. But on the other hand, it's likely a reflection of how we continuously learned more about this virus (and how we learned the Chinese were being dishonest, such as their statements that the virus could not be transmitted between people in January). 

If Europe was handling this well, I would likely be more critical of the Trump administration. But unfortunately, the US response isn't an outlier."

I (woman) was confirmed with a COVID case on Friday, and my ONLY symptoms are muscle aches, and an occasional cough and a runny nose. I have no fever or chest heaviness. I would never have identified my symptoms as possibly COVID; I assumed I had a cold. I was only tested because my fiance seems to have been infected on the same timeline as me and he has all the classic things (fever, sore throat, chest pressure).

After I was diagnosed I send an email out to friends and co-workers. I received dozens of emails back from women saying that had experienced fatigue, loss of appetite / taste, body aches, but because it never presented with a fever they assumed they had a cold. Anecdotal, yes. So I looked at the data:

South Korea, where they are doing contact / community tracing for testing, has the gender distribution at 62% women: https://www.statista.com/statistics/1102722/south-korea-coronavirus-cases-by-gender/

Italy, where they are only testing based on who has symptoms (fever, cough, shortness of breath), the gender distribution is 60% men: https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/20/health/coronavirus-italy-men-risk.html

There are some big implications here: women are often primary caregivers, in many countries the 'lockdown' permits grocery shopping, nursing, etc. If women are looking for the symptoms of fever to rule out COVID (as I did, initially), that might not necessarily be right.

How many women would not think twice about some muscle aches? It certainly would not be the first time that diagnostics have anchored on the experience of men vs. women.

I know this will need to be studied and I'm sure someone is gonna say wait for a peer reviewed study, but I think we need to stop just naming the 3 'big symptoms'. For me it started feeling like I'd slept wrong (I blamed a new mattress). If not for my fiance's symptoms I never would have thought to be tested."

I was listening to Revolutions Ep. on the General Strike and it felt...reminiscing of what we are going through - a major work stoppage. But where the country of Russia stopped working altogether as an act of defiance and had a jubilant attitude through it all. We are basically kotowing to the demands of the government - mostly state and local - to stay home and refuse to work out of fear of a disease. And most people have stopped, only essential workers aren't. But we are doing this out of ""obedience"" yet solidarity for our fellow workers and our weakest people in society. Something that the Federal Government in the form of Kudlow and Trump want to extinguish to ""restart"" the economy. So are we going to jubilantly and defiantly refuse to go to work when Trump says that the country is open for business? Or will people go into the streets, happy to no longer be confined to their apartments or out of the sheer need for a paycheck? 


I don't think Americans have the revolutionary spirit. Because one of the things Mike Duncan emphasizes is that workers were radicalized at the University lecture halls. Part of me wonders, how could we manage this in the times of coronavirus? Also, why have Universities become so insulated from the rest of public life - I mean I know why. I can only imagine what'd happen to an university's state budget if they were caught ""radicalizing"" workers into union membership, it'd go kaput. But what can take place of the university lecture hall in this day and age? The Bernie fireside chats? The DSA zoom meetings of each region? What can we do?!


Edit: I think Trump's idea of this pent up demand might have been correct a week ago. But now with so many people starting to get laid off, and millions more soon to be given a pink slip. Any money that gets put into American's hands will go into paying down debts or affording the bare necessities. I am fairly certain a lot of businesses will keep the 'leaner"" staff even if it's for a few years to make more profit. And even if you don't get fired, you might see your wages cut, or your pay frozen. Wife was telling me Burger King employees all had their wages summarily reduced by 10% during this ""crisis"".

No malarkey about whether or not a recipe (not ""activity"") is behind a paywall.  No cutesy othering back stories.  Two minor typos, nothing glaring (it's where it should be its, neans instead of beans).  Just a wealth of straight-forwardly-presented resources covering pretty much every aspect of accessible home cooking.  No need to call-out special gluten-free (or nut-free, or dairy-free, or egg-free) recipes because there is so much variety that you can just pick and choose according to your needs without having to make a big deal of them.

NEW YORK — A “cacophony of coughing” in packed emergency rooms. Beds squeezed in wherever there is space. Overworked, sleep-deprived doctors and nurses rationed to one face mask a day and wracked by worry about a dwindling number of available ventilators.

Such is the reality inside New York City’s hospitals, which have become the war-zone-like epicenter of the nation’s coronavirus crisis.

Faced with an infection rate that is five times that of the rest of the country, health workers are putting themselves at risk to fight a tide of sickness that’s getting worse by the day amid a shortage of needed supplies and promises of help from the federal government that have yet to fully materialize.

""You’re on 100% of the time — no matter what,"" said Dr. Jolion McGreevy, medical director of The Mount Sinai Hospital emergency department. ""It’s been a month of full force, and that’s certainly very stressful.”

Patients initially showed up with fairly mild symptoms, ranging from a runny nose to a mild fever, concerned they contracted coronavirus. That shifted over the past week, McGreevy said, and now hospitals are receiving far sicker patients in need of life-saving intervention.

“These are people in severe respiratory distress, needing to be intubated and needing the intensive care unit,"" he said. ""We knew it was coming. We saw it in Italy and other places so we were prepared for it, and now we’re seeing it.”

Columbia University chief surgeon Dr. Craig Smith wrote in a note to colleagues: “To think we could mimic Italy seemed risible a week ago. Not today.""

Nearly 14,800 people in New York City have been diagnosed with coronavirus as of Tuesday, accounting for more than half the cases in the hardest-hit state in the nation.

More than 2,200 people in the city were hospitalized because of the virus — double the figure from three days earlier — and more than 500 were being treated in intensive care. The death toll rose to 131, and officials from the governor on down warned it will get worse before it gets better.

“We are not slowing it. And it is accelerating on its own,” said Gov. Andrew Cuomo, predicting the state could be as close as two weeks away from a crisis that sees 40,000 people in intensive care. Such a surge would overwhelm hospitals, which now have just 3,000 intensive care unit beds statewide.

“One of the forecasters said we were looking at a freight train coming across the country. We’re now looking at a bullet train,"" he said.

Bristling at President Donald Trump's notion that Americans should be prepared to go back to work in weeks for the sake of the economy, Cuomo said that would essentially sacrifice the lives of the elderly and the most frail among us. “That's not the American way,"" he said. “That's not the New York way.”

And Cuomo appeared to mock the federal government for congratulating itself for sending the city 400 desperately needed ventilators from the national stockpile.

“What am I going to do with 400 ventilators when I need 30,000?"" he asked. ""You pick the 26,000 people who are going to die because you only sent 400 ventilators.”

Khalid Amin, a doctor at Methodist Hospital in Brooklyn, treated seven COVID-19 patients on Tuesday, ranging from 25 to 72, and he is struck by the way the disease has laid each low in the same way — the fatigue, the way they grasp for air with the slightest movement.

One patient in his 50s, moving from the bathroom to his bed, a space of less than 12 feet, seemed to struggle at one point, his chest rising and falling rapidly.

""You seem short of breath?"" Amin asked. Then came the reply, so low, Amin could barely hear him though he was inches away. ""Yes.""

Moments later, a stethoscope on the patient's back, Amin heard the same telltale sound he had been hearing in other patients that day: “It's a crackle, like crumpling paper.”

Dr. Craig Spencer, who survived a bout of Ebola in 2014 and now is director of global health in emergency medicine at New York-Presbyterian/Columbia University Medical Center, tweeted Tuesday of a ""cacophony of coughing"" in the ER, saying nearly every patient he encounters has the same symptoms, regardless of age: a persistent hack, shortness of breath and fever.

“You're afraid to take off the mask,"" he wrote. “It's the only thing that protects you.”

Smith said hospitals in the New York-Presbyterian system are burning through about 40,000 masks a day amid the crisis — about 10 times the normal amount — and have begun issuing staff members just one each day.

Mayor Bill De Blasio said about 2.2 million masks were delivered to hospitals Monday, with additional supplies en route from the state and federal governments. But he said there would have to be a lot more where that came from.

“If we run out of it, it’s like sending a soldier into war where everyone else has armor and we don’t have armor,"" said Dr. Joseph Habboushe, an emergency room physician at NYU Langone Medical Center.

The city's health department last week advised health professionals to continue working after exposure — rather than self-quarantining — unless they show symptoms.

“The more we hear about doctors and nurses getting sick, the more we get nervous,” said Dr. Eric Cioe-Pena, director of global health at Northwell Health. “It’s definitely on the mind of every health care worker in America. We don’t want to be in a position where we’re making decisions based on resources rather than the clinical care of patients.”

Cioe-Pena has been following what he calls a “decontamination routine” after every shift, in which he wipes down his phone and washes both his scrubs and street clothes.

“We’ve ventured into a battle,” he said.

Across the city, health care workers, hospital administrators and public officials were scrambling to preserve precious gear and find more treatment space before they were overwhelmed. The Jacob K. Javits Convention Center was being converted into a 1,000-bed hospital, and a fully staffed and equipped Naval hospital ship, the USNS Comfort, was expected to arrive within two weeks to provide another 1,000 beds, not for coronavirus patients but to provide relief to hospitals dealing with them.

NYU Langone's Habboushe said that while ER physicians deal with potential danger all the time, there's concern about what’s to come with the coronavirus. While the vast majority recover from the illness, older adults and people with existing health problems are particularly vulnerable and could suffer more severe illness or even death.

“The anxiety and stress that I think all of us in society are feeling right now — we are feeling it all the more so in the hospital,” he said. ""How can we deal with the idea that this is going to be worse and worse before it gets better?”

Among the biggest looming concerns, Habboushe said, is the prospect of medical professionals having to decide which patients get the potentially life-saving machines such as ventilators and which do not.

“It’s one of those things you learn about. It’s hard to imagine you actually would face that,” he said. “And now we’re all realizing there’s a really high chance we’ll be facing that, and that breaks my heart.”"

And here is US Senator John Kennedy repeating the same idea.

There will be more American politicians and political commentators promoting the same idea in the upcoming days, that the preventive measures against coronavirus (e.g. closing down restaurants), is not worth the hit to the American economy."

>Good evening.  
>  
>  
Since when we rescued our brothers in Wuhan, China, in an operation coordinated by the ministries of defense and foreign affairs, the yellow light has come to us. We started to prepare to face the coronavirus, because we knew that sooner or later it would arrive in Brazil.  
>  
>  
Our health minister met with almost all health secretaries in the states so that the strategic plan for fighting the virus could be built.  
And ever since, Dr. Henrique Mandetta has been doing an excellent job of clarifying and preparing SUS for the care of possible victims.  
>  
>  
>  
>  
But what we had to contain at that moment was panic, hysteria and, at the same time, devise a strategy to save lives and avoid mass unemployment. We did so, against everything and against everyone.  
>  
>  
Much of the media went against the grain. They spread the feeling of dread exactly, with the announcement of the large number of victims in Italy as their flagship. A country with a large number of elderly people and with a climate totally different from ours. The perfect scenario, enhanced by the media, for a real hysteria to spread throughout our country.  
>  
>  
It can be seen that, from yesterday to today, part of the press has changed its editorial, asking for calm and tranquility. That's really good. Congratulations, Brazilian press. It is essential that common sense and balance prevail among us.  
>  
>  
The virus has arrived, is being faced by us and will soon pass. Our life has to go on. Jobs must be maintained. The livelihood of families must be preserved. We must return to normality.  
>  
>  
A few state and local authorities must abandon the concept of scorched earth, the ban on transportation, the closing of businesses and mass confinement.  
What is happening in the world has shown that the risk group is that of people over 60 years old. Why close schools? Fatal cases of healthy people under the age of 40 are rare. 90% of us will have no manifestation if we get infected.  
>  
>  
What we should do is be extremely concerned about not transmitting the virus to others, especially to our dear parents and grandparents, respecting the guidelines of the Ministry of Health.  
In my particular case, due to my athlete's history, if I was infected with the virus, I wouldn't have to worry. Nothing would feel or would, at most, have a cold or a cold, as that famous doctor from that famous television said.  
>  
>  
While I am speaking, the world is seeking treatment for the disease. The American FDA and Albert Einstein hospital, in São Paulo, are seeking proof of the effectiveness of chloroquine in the treatment of Covid-19. Our government has received positive news about this medicine manufactured in Brazil and widely used to fight malaria, lupus and arthritis.  
>  
>  
I believe in God, who will train scientists and researchers from Brazil and the world to cure this disease. I take this opportunity to pay tribute to all health professionals: doctors, technical nurses and collaborators who receive us at the front lines in hospitals, treat us and comfort us.  
>  
>  
Without panic or hysteria, as I have been talking about since the beginning, we will overcome the virus and be proud to live in this new Brazil that, yes, has everything to be a great nation. We are together, increasingly united.  
God bless our dear homeland."

[White House: We’re Going to Have to Let Some People Die So the Stock Market Can Live - Vanity Fair](https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2020/03/donald-trump-coronavirus-deaths-vs-economy)

Must be one of the craziest, most dystopian opening paragraphs I've seen in a long while...

>One of the major reasons the United States is in the midst of a health crisis that has killed 427 people and infected at least 34,354 so far is the fatty mass inside Donald Trump’s head that told him If you pretend like none of this is happening, it’ll all just go away. Singularly obsessed with the stock market, the president squandered his opportunity to contain the novel coronavirus out of fear that taking strong action would damage the economy, telling advisers in February not to “do or say anything that would further spook the markets.” Obviously that plan of “action” backfired so spectacularly that it would be quite funny if not for the whole life and death thing; weirdly, not doing anything about a deadly disease and insisting it was a hoax didn’t actually make investors feel better. Terrified about the fact that the Dow and S&P were still regularly recording some of their worst days since the crash of ’87, Trump decided roughly eight days ago to stop calling the pandemic “fake news” and actually advise people to take it seriously and stay home. One week, however, apparently represented the president’s upper limit for acting quasi-responsibly. Last Thursday, he reportedly began talking privately about getting people back to work, just three days after the CDC rolled out a campaign to encourage everyone to stay home for at least 15 days. On Sunday, he all-caps tweeted, “WE CANNOT LET THE CURE BE WORSE THAN THE PROBLEM ITSELF. AT THE END OF THE 15 DAY PERIOD, WE WILL MAKE A DECISION AS TO WHICH WAY WE WANT TO GO!”"

He routinely says something that is either obviously a lie, or later turns out to be wrong, and then completely contradicts himself. He also frequently claims that his new, updated position is what he's been saying all along, and that he was saying it before anyone else. He knows more about the military than his generals, he knows more about healthcare than anyone, etc.

Regarding coronavirus, he initially called it a hoax, then said it would be no big deal and over in no time, and then later said that it's an extremely serious situation and that he's been saying it was a pandemic from the start.

I can only hope that people are starting to pay attention to just how full of shit he is. And not in the ""he's full of shit like all politicians"" sense. Trump's dishonesty and brazen contempt for the truth and the facts are on a whole new level, and that has been the case since his campaign."

A Brampton Transit operator who worked recently has been diagnosed with the COVID-19 virus.

The city hasn’t yet released details of the route or routes the operator was assigned to during the period of their infection, but Mayor Patrick Brown confirmed the case.

Brown said he is concerned about the lack of transparency by the province and other health agencies about confirmed cases and the possible exposure to residents at their workplaces, who he believes should be self-isolating when informed of possible close contact.

“I went to Peel Public Health to start telling the community when and where there is exposure. Enough secrecy,” he said. “The final straw was when I heard a transit operator tested positive for COVID-19.” 

“I know it’s not public policy to publicly say what people should be careful of, but I’m going to keep doing it. For example, tomorrow, the city is going to let public know what route the transit operator, who has tested positive was on. That’s not something we have to do, or been advised to do by public health but we’re going to do it because I want to air on the side of transparency,” he added.

Brown recently released news of a [confirmed case at a Tim Hortons kiosk at a Petro-Canada station](https://www.bramptonguardian.com/news-story/9912958-worker-at-gas-station-tim-hortons-on-hwy-10-in-brampton-tests-positive-for-coronavirus/) located at 11980 Hurontario St. on Twitter after both Tim Hortons and Petro-Canada informed customers on the same platform.

The mayor asked customers to self-isolate for 14 days, but Peel Region’s health department [informed customers shortly after there was no reason for concern](https://www.bramptonguardian.com/news-story/9913117-customers-at-brampton-tim-hortons-petro-canada-with-infected-worker-not-at-risk-for-covid-19-peel-region/) of contracting the quickly spreading disease.

Brown said he doesn’t agree with that mentality and wants residents to be vigilant when it comes to even brief interactions with people confirmed to be infected with the deadly virus.

“It’s not an exact science. And so, I have to admit I worry that we’re a little lenient with how we’re approaching this. I have complete confidence in Dr. Lawrence Loh and Peel Public Health, but I worry that here in Canada we’re still a little too relax in terms of the gravity and seriousness of the situation,” said the mayor.

“I’m not a health expert, I’m a politician, and obviously I acknowledge you should defer to health experts. But, my gut tells me looking at what happened in South Korea and elsewhere that you should side with a more conservative approach when it comes to a pandemic,” he added.

Peel Region [confirmed 18 more cases](https://dash.parsely.com/bramptonguardian.com/posts/oeo2cMsgKLc-18-newly-confirmed-coronavirus-cases-in-peel-brings-total-to-56/?minutes=10), bringing the total number across the region up to 56 as of 10 a.m. on March 24.

It happens in every big dip in the market dating all the way back to the 1930s, and we had one on February 28th as well.

Because the sell off was so rapid in the past months, stocks are oversold right now, and many will see it as an opportunity to buy. Add that to the fact that the Fed is pumping trillions into the market and you'll see a rise in stocks like we had today. Also add in this trillion dollar relief plan by the white house and you'll see a few more days of sustained recovery (maybe even up to a few weeks, but I doubt that).

&#x200B;

Why it will go back down is due to a bunch of reasons, most of which are obvious.

First is coronavirus (which in itself is 3 reasons). Businesses will still suffer and unemployment will go up even if the relief bill works, thousands will die over the next few months because the US still isn't taking this threat seriously, and supply chains are still heavily affected across the globe.

Second is that the stock market had unprecedented growth over the last 10 years and we're only back to 2017 levels (2.5 years ago). Compare that to a recession like 2008, and you'll see that 2008 set us back 7 years in market value, and the growth we had before the crash wasn't nearly as high as the past 10 years.

Thirdly, there's a reason why the fed has cut interest rates to 0, loans trillions to banks every day, and eliminated the reserve requirement for financial institutions. Businesses are in big trouble because of how much debt they all have. They've been racking up more and more debt to keep their stock growing, and unless they are able to get more loans, they'll start defaulting and declare bankruptcy, which is likely to happen to a lot of companies under $20b value.

Fourthly, all these trillions of dollars that the fed and the government are releasing should decrease the value of USD due to inflation, but it's not. Why? Because right now cash is king. Stocks AND bonds are now risky, so people opted into holding USD, which has made its value actually increase! When people start withdrawing out of USD into other currencies and investments, there may or may be a big problem with inflation and other things I don't pretend to know about.

Other, less obvious reasons include the increase in the number of junk bonds issued by corporations (which when/if they declare bankruptcy, will cause a huge issue in itself), there is an oil price war going on, the eurodollar loans (which I don't fully understand), and a host of other reasons that I can't name off the top of my head.

Off contract in 2020, the England forward admitted he feared he may have played his last game after the league made the unprecedented call to postpone the season amid the health crisis following two rounds.

“I hope not,” he told Fox Sports’ NRL 360.

“Obviously no one really knows what time frame (the NRL has shut down) at the moment and what the future holds.

“I certainly hope that wouldn’t be the case and I guess my first instinct in answering that question I’d prefer it not to be.” The popular Dragons bruiser at first tried to make light of the NRL postponement.

“Self-isolation won’t be too bad. I’ll now know what my wife does every day,” he laughed.

And asked about his initial reaction about the unprecedented postponement, Graham said: “Who’s house are we going to drink at? But maturity kicked in and we realised that we need to follow the government advice.” However Graham admitted the coronavirus crisis had put things in perspective. “It’s only been a day (since the NRL postponement) but I’ve had plenty of time to think about this,” he said.

“I’m very empathetic towards the people around the world that are struggling at the minute and it’s put a lot of perspective on stuff.

“I was talking to my nan the other day in England to see how she was. “She’s 90 now and she was quick to turn the conversation to a time where she was evacuated from Liverpool (during World War II).

“Being a parent myself, just thinking about what that would’ve been like and we’re fortunate enough that the likelihood of this affecting kids is pretty minimal.”

**WILL WE SEE THEM AGAIN?**

**Cameron Smith (37)**

The oldest player in the NRL, Smith had yet to confirm that 2020 would be his final season but many assumed this would be it given he almosted retired at the end of 2019. However, some time away from the sport may rejuvenate the greatest dummy half the sport has ever seen, and he may well still be around when the competition resumes, whenever that may be.

**Contract status:** Off contract at season’s end.

**Gavin Cooper (35)**

North Queensland backrower Cooper played his 300th NRL game last season and is in the midst of his 15th NRL season. Off-contract at the end of 2020, it shaped as his final season in the big leagues. If Cooper does retire, he will be the last foundation player of the Gold Coast Titans to hang up the boots - the former Queensland Origin rep played for the nascent club in 2007 and 2008.

**Contract status:** Off contract at season’s end.

**Benji Marshall (35)**

Marshall had yet to make a decision on his future and given 2018 and 2019 were supposed to be his final season in the big time, he may well run around again. If his performances in the first two weeks were anything to go by, the Tigers legend still has plenty in the tank.

**Contract status:** Off contract at season’s end

**Adam Blair (34)**

Blair has a player option for 2021 but at 34 and with over 300 NRL games and almost 50 Tests under his belt there’s a lot of miles of the veteran forward. The former Storm, Broncos and Tigers forward is one of Stephen Kearney’s favourites, but you never know when a player has had enough.

**Contract status:** Player option in his favour for 2021.

**James Graham (34)**

Off-contract at year\s end, 2020 was shaping as Graham’s final season in the NRL. Given the Englishman played over 200 matches for St Helens before he even came to the NRL and has accumulated close to 450 first-class games all told, there’s not a lot of tread left on the tyres.

**Contract status:** Off contract at season’s end.

**Brett Morris (34)**

Morris joined the Roosters last year after Canterbury were happy to let him go and ended the year with his second premiership, playing a huge role in the grand final victory over Canberra. He might be 34, but Morris is still a very competent and capable winger, and if he wanted to keep playing in 2021 there are plenty of clubs who could use a finisher of his calibre.

**Contract status:** Off contract at season’s end.

**Josh Morris (34)**

I don’t mean to imply Josh and Brett Morris are in the same boat just because they\re twins, but they are in very similar situations. Morris had a resurgent year last season with the Sharks, and his move to the Roosters shaped as a fun career swansong given his desire to play with his brother one last time. If the 2020 season is cancelled there may not be a play for Morris at Bondi given Billy Smith will have recovered from his ACL injury.

**Contract status:** Off contract at season’s end.

**Sia Soliola (34)**

Soliola recently outlined his desire to play one for at least one more year, and given his form in the first two rounds that shapes as a sound investment for the Raiders. Tough as anything and still an important contributor with his linespeed and toughness, Soliola is a good bet to play on next season.

**Contract status:** Off contract at season’s end, wants to play another season.

**Darius Boyd (33)**

The only one of this group to have officially announced his retirement, Boyd/s career is now hanging by a thread. Given Brisbane’s salary cap situation, a repreive and extension of his long career seems very unlikely.

**Contract status:** Planned to retire."

Imagine as nursing home manager you have a flurry of phone calls from staff to say they are no longer working? Or your staff just do not arrive for their shift?? 
The nursing homes mentioned had an avalanche of staff phoning in and/or leaving their employment because of fear of catching the coronavirus. 
In the current climate recruiting new staff is totally impossible to work in nursing homes known to be infected. So staff were left working , caring for terribly sick elderly patients with a fraction of the ideal staffing numbers. Madrid is requesting that the elderly patients not to be admitted to hospital. To leave these patients at home.  

So sadly the remaining staff probably did their best under tremendous strain. 
Yeah it looks bad but if you read this story in several news sources you get a wider picture. 

Also if you have several deaths and there is no established system for retrieval of “high risk infected cadavers” what do you do??? Who is going to collect? Nobody. The funeral directors are collapsed. There was until yesterday nowhere to safely store bodies.

RNA is not a stable system for storing genetic material, especially in the cytoplasm of a cell (the space outside the nucleus).  

Now, I need to walk back and clarify what I said above.

The viruses that can set up a latent infection (herpesviruses, retroviruses) store that information as DNA in the nucleus.  If you are older than 30 or so, you have varicella-zoster virus (chickenpox), which is a herpesvirus, hanging out in the nerve bundles next to your spinal cord and you feel nothing...until one day you get shingles.

There are other RNA viruses that can set up persistent infections (hepatitis B and C), but those viruses are constantly replicating and that causes constant inflammation.  That’s why hepatitis B and Hepatitis C are risks for liver cancer.

But coronaviruses are not like that.  No coronavirus is known to cause either latent or persistent infection.  And this one can’t, either.  People clear it."

He's probably willing to die for his own stock portfolio. This perspective is not entirely irrational. If he is 60+, he is probably right about to retire.   


If the stock markets drop to great depression era levels, probably all the wealth he has built up over his entire life literally evaporates, and he will probably never be around long enough to make it back. Maybe he think if there is a depression, he will lose his job, and he will certainly  not be able to find a new one given the rampant age-discrimination.

He was very reassuring, said what he would do if he was president right now, and made it seem so obvious that any normal president would be doing every damned thing they could to help everybody in every way right now."

2020-03-24,cleverfibername,Coronavirus,12,https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/fogj08/la_first_pediatric_death_due_to_covid19/flf1jog/,"Los Angeles County reached another grim milestone amid the coronavirus pandemic Tuesday when health officials announced the first death of someone younger than 18.

Experts have long said that older people are more susceptible to the virus and that young people in general are less likely to contract the illness. But health officials said Tuesday the death underscores the threat that coronavirus poses to the entire population.

“This is a devastating reminder that COVID-19 affects people of all ages,” L.A. County Public Health Department Director Barbara Ferrer said.

The Health Department was working to confirm how the minor contracted the virus and whether any underlying health issues exacerbated the illness. The agency also is also working to confirm whether the case marks the first such death of a minor linked to coronavirus in the country, but cases are not always broken down by age, said Tim Gilman, a representative for the department. The person lived in Lancaster.

Mayor Eric Garcetti told CNN the victim was a teenager.

The death toll in Los Angeles County now stands at 11.

According to a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention report released last week, there had been no coronavirus fatalities in the United States of people under 18. The report also said there had been no reported ICU admissions for people under 19.


Age breakdowns

Overall, relatively few young people have tested positive in Los Angeles County. But the data show people between the ages of 18 and 65 have tested positive most often. (These number exclude Pasadena and Long Beach):

0-17: 10
18-40: 268
41-65: 250
65+: 107

In Orange County, the numbers are similar:

0-17: 1
18-49: 87
50-64: 41
65+ 23

Here are the statewide age breakdowns, as of Monday:

0-17: 25
18-49: 837
50-64: 442
65+: 415
Unknown age: 14

Child risks

Overall, officials have said young children are at lesser risk than older people for contracting the coronavirus.

One possible reason why babies, toddlers and young children have not been critically threatened is because of their immature immune systems. An undeveloped immune system might prevent the body from triggering inflammation severe enough to result in pneumonia, septic shock or organ failure.


A sweeping review of 44,672 lab-confirmed COVID-19 patients in China published in early March by Chinese authorities found that no deaths occurred among anyone younger than 10.

Another study by experts in Wuhan, China — the epicenter of the outbreak — published in the Journal of the American Medical Assn., sought to review all hospitalized infants diagnosed with COVID-19 infection between Dec. 8 and Feb. 6 in China.

By Feb. 6, there had been 31,211 confirmed cases of COVID-19 and 637 fatalities. But the authors could find only nine infected babies who were hospitalized nationwide.

“None of the nine infants required intensive care or mechanical ventilation or had any severe complications,” the study said.

Four had fever, two had mild upper respiratory tract symptoms and one had no symptoms but tested positive for the virus because of the baby’s exposure to infected family. There were no symptoms available for the other two patients.

And a report published in the World Journal of Pediatrics, summarizing experts’ consensus on the coronavirus in children, also warned that people who have a “silent infection” are among the main sources of transmission for the illness.

“We also should attach importance to asymptomatic cases, which may play a critical role in the transmission process,” the report said. “Respiratory droplets and contact are the main transmission routes. Close contact with symptomatic cases and asymptomatic cases with silent infection are the main transmission routes of [novel coronavirus] infection in children.”


And while children are largely spared the worst effects of the coronavirus, the first reports to document COVID-19 deaths in children make clear that those under 18 are neither immune from infection nor completely spared from becoming very sick.

In China, the novel coronavirus has claimed the lives of a 10-month-old and a 14-year-old, at least."

He’d called for disallowing cruise ships to disembark, to increase testing of people and to implement a travel quarantine well before such actions became official policy.

Green has made it no secret that he’s disappointed with the administration’s response to the coronavirus crisis, particularly with what he sees as the inadequacy of the Department of Health’s testing program.

“It’s a total fail,” he said last week. “We have to protect our people. We have to test those who are sick and every municipality across the country knows now we have to test and find where the disease is and test any contact cases and that’s the way to slow the spread of this disease.”"""

Today's upside move was 50% larger than yesterday's down move.  All of the previous huge up moves were just reactions that barely matched their immediate prior downside moves.

Obviously, the reason is the $1.5 trillion stimulus combined with Trump wanting people back to work by Easter and Italy's coronavirus rates of death/cases decelerating.

We're still in a bear market, but this bounce could be the start of a multi-day/multi-week move so I would advise against immediately trying to short every bounce which worked the past couple of weeks.  

This is the part of the bear market where things are more likely to move sideways with a lean upwards until we get clarity on when another down leg will come into play.

Outside perspective might be interesting.

Here's a slightly cleaned up [deepl](https://www.DeepL.com/Translator) translation. I've bolded and itallcized the relevant bits.

> **Cannon fodder or heroes of the fatherland? Why British health workers won't win against corona**


> The British government has quarantined the country to fight the corona-epidemic. Prime Minister Boris Johnson speaks of a national emergency and is deploying the military to get mouth masks and other medical supplies to hospitals and health centers. The British must prepare for difficult times and the doctors and nurses have been bombed to save the fatherland. But Johnson's call to arms sounds false. 


> The doctors and nurses at the British National Health Service (NHS) are being hailed as heroes of the fatherland.  They are ""on the front line in the war zone"" and ""fighting for the country against the coronavirus"". The praise they receive from the British government must sound particularly false to those working in the NHS for a number of reasons. 


> First of all. The Conservative British government has allowed the epidemic to muddle on and no one has reacted satisfactorily. **The first case of corona was diagnosed as early as the end of January and yet it seemed as if the island was living on its own in the following weeks. The corona epidemic was reported in the British press, but rarely about the situation in their own country.** The British government, like the Netherlands, also followed its own strategy. It **deliberately deviated from the isolation measures** that were applied in China and South Korea as well as in several severely affected countries in Europe.

> The United Kingdom allowed its inhabitants to roam freely for weeks on end, visiting old people, playing sports and shopping. ""Herd immunity"" is what it's called, making the people immune by allowing the virus to break out so that the sick would make antibodies to defeat the virus. In fact, last Sunday the Sunday Times said that Prime Minister Johnson's personal advisor, Dominic Cummings, was a big fan of that approach in February, ""if it means some elderly, retired people will die,"" the Times quoted a summit attendee. Downing Street 10 strongly denies that statement, but the strategy was applied.


> The British were advised to wash their hands well. **Only people with clear symptoms were tested for the virus. Healthcare workers, for example, were not. Critics called that strategy a risky gamble**, even though the advice came from a committee led by two renowned professors, Chris Witty and Sir Patrick Vallance ... At a press conference on 19 March, Witty spoke about the risks of a full lockdown. It could make singles lonely, for example. ""If you start something too early, you could get the negative consequences without changing the course of the pandemic."" 

> The British government continued to speak in the conditional tense for almost a month and a half. **While drastic measures were being taken everywhere at the instigation of the World Health Organisation**, it kept advising, suggesting and announcing that more drastic measures might have to be taken for the vulnerable. Meanwhile, **the British continued to work, shake hands, party, - discipline was often very lacking - and the number of victims increased.** Exactly how many is not yet clear, because only on 18 March it was announced that the government would carry out more tests, 25,000 a day, albeit within four weeks. Today the United Kingdom is in a bad way: with 8,077 cases in tenth place in the world, and with 422 deaths (113 more than yesterday!) even in seventh place. 


> **It was only last night that Prime Minister Johnson decided to go ahead and follow the example of most other European countries** and ban everyone from going outside, except for necessary trips to work and to buy food and medicine or go for walks. Johnson had been pressured by the health workers but also by his own government, it says.


> **But sadly, the harm may have been done in the meantime.** Even if the professors were right with their medical tactics and not all other epidemiologists in Europe and China, that decision is pernicious, because **the British health care system cannot cope with this crisis.** That is the second reason for an announced disaster. 


> Last weekend several thousand doctors and nurses wrote a letter to the British government. They begged for medical equipment, for mouth masks - because theirs were outdated - for tests, for breathing machines, more beds and especially more staff. 

> **The testimonies are downright scary**. The signatories write that for weeks now they have been receiving questions from concerned doctors and nurses because they are not protected to fight the corona-epidemic by the right means. Doctors in intensive care have to perform the most risky procedures with mouth masks that had to be disposed of as early as 2015. Sometimes masks are simply not available.  Also **on social media NHS employees are now watching the compliments they receive. ""We feel like cannon fodder**,"" that's how they described their situation. 


> The cuts in the NHS and in other welfare sectors are already an old sore point. In ten years' time, the number of hospital beds under Conservative rule has fallen from 144,000 to 128,000, on a population that is becoming increasingly grey. **Great Britain has fewer beds per 1000 inhabitants than Italy, for example.** In intensive care, however, the number of beds has increased. There are now 4,000 and Prime Minister Johnson wants to increase that number to 8,000 before this crisis. Minister of Health Matt Hancock has also moved up a gear and has promised ""millions"" of mouth masks and other protective equipment. He has written to 65,000 retired doctors and nurses ""to assist those on the front line"". Only a tenth of them have removed his doctor's jacket or apron. The army is driving around to hospitals and care centres to provide medical protection equipment. ""We're getting there, but we're not there yet,"" said Saffron Cordery, CEO of NHS Providers, at the BBC this morning.

Traces of the novel coronavirus were found in the cabins on the Diamond Princess cruise ship up to 17 days after passengers left.

**Why it matters:** The finding in a study published by the CDC Monday shows that COVID-19 can survive in places for much longer than was previously known.

The new coronavirus may already have infected far more people in the UK than scientists had previously estimated — perhaps as much as half the population — according to modelling by researchers at the University of Oxford.

If the results are confirmed, they imply that fewer than one in a thousand of those infected with Covid-19 become ill enough to need hospital treatment, said Sunetra Gupta, professor of theoretical epidemiology, who led the study. The vast majority develop very mild symptoms or none at all.

“We need immediately to begin large-scale serological surveys — antibody testing — to assess what stage of the epidemic we are in now,” she said.

The modelling by Oxford’s Evolutionary Ecology of Infectious Disease group indicates that Covid-19 reached the UK by mid-January at the latest. Like many emerging infections, it spread invisibly for more than a month before the first transmissions within the UK were officially recorded at the end of February.

The research presents a very different view of the epidemic to the modelling at Imperial College London, which has strongly influenced government policy. “I am surprised that there has been such unqualified acceptance of the Imperial model,” said Prof Gupta.

However, she was reluctant to criticise the government for shutting down the country to suppress viral spread, because the accuracy of the Oxford model has not yet been confirmed and, even if it is correct, social distancing will reduce the number of people becoming seriously ill and relieve severe pressure on the NHS during the peak of the epidemic.

The Oxford study is based on a what is known as a “susceptibility-infected-recovered model” of Covid-19, built up from case and death reports from the UK and Italy. The researchers made what they regard as the most plausible assumptions about the behaviour of the virus.

The modelling brings back into focus “herd immunity”, the idea that the virus will stop spreading when enough people have become resistant to it because they have already been infected. The government abandoned its unofficial herd immunity strategy — allowing controlled spread of infection — after its scientific advisers said this would swamp the National Health Service with critically ill patients.

But the Oxford results would mean the country had already acquired substantial herd immunity through the unrecognised spread of Covid-19 over more than two months. If the findings are confirmed by testing, then the current restrictions could be removed much sooner than ministers have indicated.

Although some experts have shed doubt on the strength and length of the human immune response to the virus, Prof Gupta said the emerging evidence made her confident that humanity would build up herd immunity against Covid-19.

To provide the necessary evidence, the Oxford group is working with colleagues at the Universities of Cambridge and Kent to start antibody testing on the general population as soon as possible, using specialised “neutralisation assays which provide reliable readout of protective immunity,” Prof Gupta said. They hope to start testing later this week and obtain preliminary results within a few days."

Please read the article instead of calling it left-wing propaganda.^[[1]](https://apnews.com/9eb91412da9380c61ecccbfea98845f9)

>President Donald Trump misstated the facts Thursday when he asserted that the Food and Drug Administration had just approved a decades-old malaria drug to treat patients infected by the coronavirus. After his FDA chief clarified that the drug still needs testing, Trump also overstated the drug’s potential upside in helping contain the outbreak.
A look at his claims at a news briefing:

>TRUMP: “And we’re going to be able to make that drug available almost immediately, and that’s where the FDA has been so great. They — they’ve gone through the approval process. It’s been approved.”

>THE FACTS: The drug, known chemically as chloroquine, has been available for decades to treat the mosquito-borne illness malaria. Technically, doctors can already prescribe the drug to patients with COVID-19, a practice known as off-label prescribing. But Trump falsely suggested to reporters that the FDA had just cleared the drug specifically for the viral pandemic spreading in communities across the U.S. That would mean that the drug had met the FDA’s standards for safety and effectiveness.

>Minutes later, FDA Commissioner Dr. Stephen Hahn emphasized that the drug still needs testing to determine if it can help patients. He said chloroquine would have to be tested in “a large pragmatic clinical trial to actually gather that information.”
Drug trials typically require hundreds or thousands of patients and, even when accelerated, take weeks or months to complete. In his remarks, Hahn reflected on his background as a cancer doctor and warned against giving patients “false hope” before drugs are fully vetted.

>While chloroquine has shown promise in preliminary laboratory studies, some experts are skeptical it will prove effective in human testing.

>“I think it could be a game changer, and maybe not,” Trump said, discussing the drug.
But the FDA reiterated in a statement Thursday that there are “no FDA-approved therapeutics or drugs to treat, cure or prevent COVID-19.”

_____

>TRUMP: “If chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine works, or any of the other things that they’re looking at that are not quite as far out ... your numbers are going to come down very rapidly.”

>THE FACTS: The drugs he is referring to are for treatment in patients already infected. That doesn’t prevent spread of the virus. One study is testing chloroquine to try to protect health care workers at highest risk of infection, because a vaccine is likely a year or more away.

Lots of great work come out of anarchist, decolonolization, feminist, and other traditions which can have varying degrees of Marxian influence but aren't necessarily just an application, continuation, or even extension of Marxist tradition.

""Viral propaganda""

""Not Italian at all, the virus is Chinese."" says Remuzzi, the scientist used by Beijing as a propaganda weapon

March 24, 2020

Rome. ""There is no doubt that the virus is Chinese. This is an example of a manual, to be taught in the University, as never by manipulating scientific information for propaganda reasons."" Professor Giuseppe Remuzzi, director of the Mario Negri Institute and one of the best-known Italian citizens in the world, in recent days he has unwillingly become an instrument of Beijing propaganda, which has issued a declaration to make believe that the origin of the coronavirus could be Italian.

In a few days' interview on the American national public radio, Remuzzi stated that some doctors in the province of Bergamo recall having seen ""strange pneumonia, very serious, especially in the elderly in December and even in November. It means that the virus was circulating at least in Lombardy before we learned about it ""of the Wuhan outbreak made known in January. Over the weekend, various Chinese propaganda organs, including the Global Times and the Chinese embassy in France, used Remuzzi's statement to argue that the pandemic could have started in Italy. ""This is a statement, an insinuation, completely instrumental for internal and external propaganda purposes,"" Prof. Remuzzi. ""There is no doubt, based on genetics, that the virus is Chinese. He described it very well in Science Daniel Lucey, of Georgetown University, who showed all the way traveled by the virus. The first infections occurred in China in November, maybe even earlier. Again, there is no doubt that the virus is Chinese. ""In recent days Remuzzi has been contacted by many Chinese journalists who were looking for confirmation of the alleged Italian origin of the virus."

There was one about how rent control doesn't work because it disincentivizes developers from building more housing and makes landlords convert their apartment complexes into condos and luxury housing and how rent control is causing a massive housing shortage all around Europe. Doesn't increasing public housing combat this though? They didn't touch on that.

Another one was about socialism. They had a vuvuzuela segment where they actually did say you can't attribute their failures to socialism, but they ended with a segment about Scandinavia (at least they correctly said it's not really socialist). Though they had a Trump economist on who said that in Scandinavia their social safety net makes them not work as hard and that the ruthless nature of the American system is what makes us the leading innovators of everything, and that the only reason Scandinavia has a good quality of life is because they coast off of America's achievements. Also referenced his own study that claimed Bernie's policies would cause untold destruction to the economy and a 50% drop in the stock market.

The last one was about coronavirus and wasn't really that political except for one line they had about how one of the worst outcomes of social distancing is disrupting the American workplace, because Americans are better at socializing than others and conversations with coworkers are where a lot of innovation happens.

It's very difficult to get a straight answer to that question because nobody seems to have been able to get access to the entirety of the bills to read them. Even if you could, understanding them is another story - apparently the Democrats' bill is 1200 pages so if that isn't something taken out of context to sensationalize things, then that's a helluva lot of information to go through for an expert, let alone a layperson.

The big sticking points I have seen reported that the Democrats put in their bill that the Republicans didn't like was about making airlines go carbon neutral by 2025 and halving emissions by 2050, cash for education initiatives (the Republican bill has this too but the Democrat bill has almost 3X as much money allocated), and it has a section specifically aimed at reversing some of Trump's Executive Orders:

>The bill includes a section that would nullify several executive orders and presidential memorandums that Democrats say have undermined the ability of public sector unions to engage in collective bargaining. Democrats say the directives set an aggressive schedule for unions to bargain and limit the time unions have to perform official duties ""by over 91 percent in some cases,"" the bill says. 

That quote, plus a few other items, [are from here](https://www.rollcall.com/2020/03/23/crunch-time-for-stimulus-bill-as-us-coronavirus-cases-top-35k/), and Politico has a fairly good [comparison of the contrasts between the two bills here](https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/23/house-democrats-stimulus-senate-coronavirus-145388).

I thought it was shameful when the Republican party tried to push their agenda rather than get the urgently-needed help to people who need it. I agree with more of the Democrat's goals and principles in this case but I think it's equally shameful for them to include extra things in their bill too. It seems obvious that the point of all this on both sides is to either:

1. Get something you want that you wouldn't have gotten otherwise, OR
2. Get a chance to throw out a soundbyte/tweet/blog post saying that your side had a great bill ready to help the American people, and that what America needs right now is bipartisanship and togetherness, and we would have it if only those *other* people would help us out a little bit gosh darnit!

Either way you get something! Might as well shoot your shot - on both sides, right? What've you got to lose?

Oh, right, the lives and livelihoods of the population of the country you're supposed to serve. Oh well."

-They are working on ability for patients to take their own sample at drive thru testing sites, which will free up PPE for hospital workers.

-Our new cases will continue to surge because we have a backlog of tests. We won't know actual growth trends until we reach 24 hour cycle.

-56% of confirmed cases and 31% of fatalities in United States are coming out of metro NY area

-It is critical that those that left NY must self quarantine for 14 days based on when they left NY.

Edit:

Dr. Fauci:

-They need to know penetrance of infection on all areas of the country to make decision on opening up areas. Areas of country with low number of infections still have the ability to contain the infection with contact tracing now that availability of testing is possible.

-They situation in NY is terrible where 1 per 1000 is infected. Those that leave NY must self monitor, self isolate, get tested to prevent spread to rest of the country.

The thing is he owns them outright. I called him up today to discuss this very issue and asked what would happen if one of his renters lost their jobs and couldn’t pay rent. My dad said he would have to take the loss and would be willing to work with them by allowing them time to get on their feet. He wouldn’t kick them out for losing their income due to the virus. But, not all landlords can afford to do this unfortunately and I don’t necessarily agree that renters should be giving them so much shit. An unforeseen emergency can happen ANYTIME.

Newsom was a rich kid that had everything handed to him growing up - a spoiled rich kid who never worked for anything in his whole life.

Valid from what perspective? It’s not valid from a public health perspective, because not only will it lead to many millions of deaths as a result of Covid-19, but a wide number of preventable deaths from other causes because healthcare systems are overwhelmed. 

And the economy will be severely affected either way. Do you think people will just go to crowded stores when they know that a person went to that store two weeks ago, contracted coronavirus and died? Are offices going to stay open if a large portion of their workforce gets sick at the same time? Won’t schools have to close anyway if half of the teachers are sick? The populations it affects are disproportionately more likely to own property; will the housing market survive if 3%+ of the inventory suddenly appears on the market?

But, citing privacy laws, ASU said it won't disclose where the people who tested positive live, whether in the dorms or off campus,or which campus they're on.

As the pandemic continues, ASU spokeswoman Katie Paquet said, the university expects to see more of its community members test positive. The majority of the 15 cases are still living in Arizona, she said.

So far, the state has [reported 326 identified cases and five known deaths](https://www.azcentral.com/story/news/local/arizona-health/2020/03/24/arizona-coronavirus-covid-19-tuesday-march-24-update-5-known-deaths-326-identified-cases/2907464001/) because of COVID-19.

The State Press, ASU's student newspaper, [first reported](https://www.statepress.com/article/2020/03/spcommunity-coronavirus-q-a-with-president-crow) the positive ASU tests in an interview with ASU President Michael Crow.

The ASU community had the [state's first identified coronavirus case](https://www.azcentral.com/story/news/local/arizona-breaking/2020/01/26/first-case-coronavirus-reaches-arizona-fifth-person-infected/4582588002/) as well, though that person, a [male in his 20s ](https://www.azcentral.com/story/news/local/arizona-health/2020/02/07/arizona-patient-coronavirus-male-his-20-s-state-says/4694087002/)who had traveled to Wuhan, China, has since recovered."

February 24: “The Coronavirus is very much under control in the USA… Stock Market starting to look very good to me!”

February 26: “The 15 (cases in the US) within a couple of days is going to be down to close to zero.”

February 26: “We're going very substantially down, not up.”

February 27: “One day it’s like a miracle, it will disappear.”

February 28: “We're ordering a lot of supplies. We're ordering a lot of, uh, elements that frankly we wouldn't be ordering unless it was something like this. But we're ordering a lot of different elements of medical.”

March 2: “You take a solid flu vaccine, you don't think that could have an impact, or much of an impact, on corona?”

March 2: “A lot of things are happening, a lot of very exciting things are happening and they’re happening very rapidly.”

March 5: “I NEVER said people that are feeling sick should go to work.”

March 5: “The United States… has, as of now, only 129 cases… and 11 deaths. We are working very hard to keep these numbers as low as possible!”

March 6: “I think we’re doing a really good job in this country at keeping it down… a tremendous job at keeping it down.”

March 6: “Anybody right now, and yesterday, anybody that needs a test gets a test. They’re there. And the tests are beautiful…. the tests are all perfect like the letter was perfect. The transcription was perfect. Right? This was not as perfect as that but pretty good.”

March 6: “I like this stuff. I really get it. People are surprised that I understand it… Every one of these doctors said, ‘How do you know so much about this?’ Maybe I have a natural ability. Maybe I should have done that instead of running for president.”

March 6: “I don't need to have the numbers double because of one ship that wasn't our fault.”

March 8: “We have a perfectly coordinated and fine tuned plan at the White House for our attack on CoronaVirus.”

March 9: “This blindsided the world.”

March 13: [Declared state of emergency]

>	French President Emmanuel Macron, who blocked the opening of talks with Skopje and Tirana in October, said in February he was willing to allow them to begin membership talks if the European Commission gave them a positive review and changed the way it admits new countries.

I grew up in the south and I’m familiar enough with the religious community to know that they will certainly be filling churches that day no matter what the current status of Coronavirus is. They will pray the sickness away before they don’t show up for Easter 🤷‍♂️beyond that We know Nevada’s Governor wants EDC to happen as scheduled, we know the only way to override that is a federal intervention. We know Trump wants business to return as usual ASAP. So who wants to wager that Easter Day will be the day thousands congregate on the news and by the time edc comes around a whole month later it will be a drop in the bucket compared to all the congregating that has come before it?

""Viral propaganda""

""Not Italian at all, the virus is Chinese."" says Remuzzi, the scientist used by Beijing as a propaganda weapon

March 24, 2020

Rome. ""There is no doubt that the virus is Chinese. This is an example of a manual, to be taught in the University, as never by manipulating scientific information for propaganda reasons."" Professor Giuseppe Remuzzi, director of the Mario Negri Institute and one of the best-known Italian citizens in the world, in recent days he has unwillingly become an instrument of Beijing propaganda, which has issued a declaration to make believe that the origin of the coronavirus could be Italian.

In a few days' interview on the American national public radio, Remuzzi stated that some doctors in the province of Bergamo recall having seen ""strange pneumonia, very serious, especially in the elderly in December and even in November. It means that the virus was circulating at least in Lombardy before we learned about it ""of the Wuhan outbreak made known in January. Over the weekend, various Chinese propaganda organs, including the Global Times and the Chinese embassy in France, used Remuzzi's statement to argue that the pandemic could have started in Italy. ""This is a statement, an insinuation, completely instrumental for internal and external propaganda purposes,"" Prof. Remuzzi. ""There is no doubt, based on genetics, that the virus is Chinese. He described it very well in Science Daniel Lucey, of Georgetown University, who showed all the way traveled by the virus. The first infections occurred in China in November, maybe even earlier. Again, there is no doubt that the virus is Chinese. ""In recent days Remuzzi has been contacted by many Chinese journalists who were looking for confirmation of the alleged Italian origin of the virus."

Look at East Asian countries: Japan, China, South Korea, Hong Kong, Taiwan, and Singapore, Japan and Taiwan in particular (due to China's data's obvious unreliability)

Japan and Taiwan, rather than ""flattening the curve"", seemed to have completely stopped the virus from spreading, with very few deaths and cases per day and a low cumulative total.  South Korea does, however, seem to be ""flattening the curve"", with a steady-rate of new cases and deaths per day.

While South Korea's experience makes sense, while being almost miraculous, it simply doesn't make sense that countries with such dense populations as Taiwan and Japan could go beyond mere ""flattening the curve"" to **completely** **stopping** the coronavirus from spreading at all, even considering their efforts. It just doesn't seem possible because the idea behind ""flattening the curve' isn't that the virus will literally stop, but that cases should slow down and make it more manageable for hospitals.

The only two plausible explanation for Japan and Taiwan's experience, if their data are correct, are:  
(1) the virus had already run its course through the countries before they detected it and are now monitoring the viruses decline, or  
(2) they've ""stopped the curve"", like a damn stops water, so to speak and should expect the virus to spread the instant they relax their restrictions."

If the results are confirmed, they imply that fewer than one in a thousand of those infected with Covid-19 become ill enough to need hospital treatment, said Sunetra Gupta, professor of theoretical epidemiology, who led the study. The vast majority develop very mild symptoms or none at all.

“We need immediately to begin large-scale serological surveys — antibody testing — to assess what stage of the epidemic we are in now,” she said.

The modelling by Oxford’s Evolutionary Ecology of Infectious Disease group indicates that Covid-19 reached the UK by mid-January at the latest. Like many emerging infections, it spread invisibly for more than a month before the first transmissions within the UK were officially recorded at the end of February.

The research presents a very different view of the epidemic to the modelling at Imperial College London, which has strongly influenced government policy. “I am surprised that there has been such unqualified acceptance of the Imperial model,” said Prof Gupta. 

However, she was reluctant to criticise the government for shutting down the country to suppress viral spread, because the accuracy of the Oxford model has not yet been confirmed and, even if it is correct, social distancing will reduce the number of people becoming seriously ill and relieve severe pressure on the NHS during the peak of the epidemic.

The Oxford study is based on a what is known as a “susceptibility-infected-recovered model” of Covid-19, built up from case and death reports from the UK and Italy. The researchers made what they regard as the most plausible assumptions about the behaviour of the virus.

The modelling brings back into focus “herd immunity”, the idea that the virus will stop spreading when enough people have become resistant to it because they have already been infected. The government abandoned its unofficial herd immunity strategy — allowing controlled spread of infection — after its scientific advisers said this would swamp the National Health Service with critically ill patients. 

But the Oxford results would mean the country had already acquired substantial herd immunity through the unrecognised spread of Covid-19 over more than two months. If the findings are confirmed by testing, then the current restrictions could be removed much sooner than ministers have indicated.

Although some experts have shed doubt on the strength and length of the human immune response to the virus, Prof Gupta said the emerging evidence made her confident that humanity would build up herd immunity against Covid-19.

To provide the necessary evidence, the Oxford group is working with colleagues at the Universities of Cambridge and Kent to start antibody testing on the general population as soon as possible, using specialised “neutralisation assays which provide reliable readout of protective immunity,” Prof Gupta said. They hope to start testing later this week and obtain preliminary results within a few days."

I am new to Reddit, happy to join it!

I am a Physician and a Resercher, currently studying possible antiviral treatments for COVID-19. Despite my knowledge on therapy I'd like to talk about the spread of Coronavirus and possible countermeasures used in this situations.  USA is on the road to become the country with more cases and the strategy to block it has not been discussed appropriately.

SARS-CoV-2 Pandemic is spreading accross the world and each country has adopted countermeasure to block its porgression, ""flattening"" the curve and allowing their healthcare systems to treat all the patients in a proper way.

The country that showed the best management using a suppression protocol was South Korea, which using a wide testing, data tracking algorithms and people cooperation was able to suppress national cases to less than 11.000.

On the other hand, Italy, Spain, France and UK are under a complete lockdown after the spread of the infection and are seeing exponential growth curves which only in Italy are suggestive of an inflection point (Italy Lockdown was on March 9th so 15 days ago).

USA failed to suppress the infection, similarly to Europe, but refuses to lockdown the country and as of today, only few states are on shelter-in-place order while others maintain their normal life and accept in-flights.

Being USA a huge country any asymptomatic or mild symptomatic individual which leaves the most infected areas to a different state, can be the ""fuel"" which maintains the infection at high levels and favors its spreading.

From this perspective the limited lockdown of some country, the self-quarantine and the isolation are not enough to mitigate the infection which can spread within inside-country travellers.

&#x200B;

The only way to stop the spread of the coronavirus is 

THE COMPLETE LOCKDOWN OF THE U.S.A. FOR 15 DAYS 

for which I started a petition on [Change.org](https://www.researchgate.net/deref/http%3A%2F%2FChange.org).

&#x200B;

1. What is your point of view about this?
2. Do you think that people should be free to travel inside the country?
3. Which measure on your opinion should take place now to save lives?
4. Do you think that what has been done in this country was enough to stop the infection?
5. How many cases do you think will be founded here in the US?

&#x200B;

This topic needs to be further discussed at the White House to finally starting guarantee the safety of people and communities.

If you agree with me on a complete lockdown please sign the petition and share it!

Assumedly, they will choose the pass/fail option. Since they are still required to take exams and those exams are included in the mandatory grading curve, it would be reasonable to expect that those students would take the majority of the lower grades. As a result, if all the B-s are taken by the kids hurt most by the pandemic, the kid who normally gets a B- but was less affected gets bumped up to a B. 

The kid who usually gets a B- would receive a GPA boost while the one who goes P/F stays the same. As a result, the mean GPA would increase. The adversely affected student, by virtue of being in the same position, would be worse off when compared to the new mean than previously.

I’m someone that would likely benefit. However, I don’t think it’s fair. This would privilege those students with the means of dampening the effects of the Coronavirus through the benefit of decreased competition. Those burdened by the impacts of the virus will not be unaffected but actually negatively impacted."

""Viral propaganda""

""Not Italian at all, the virus is Chinese."" says Remuzzi, the scientist used by Beijing as a propaganda weapon

March 24, 2020

Rome. ""There is no doubt that the virus is Chinese. This is an example of a manual, to be taught in the University, as never by manipulating scientific information for propaganda reasons."" Professor Giuseppe Remuzzi, director of the Mario Negri Institute and one of the best-known Italian citizens in the world, in recent days he has unwillingly become an instrument of Beijing propaganda, which has issued a declaration to make believe that the origin of the coronavirus could be Italian.

In a few days' interview on the American national public radio, Remuzzi stated that some doctors in the province of Bergamo recall having seen ""strange pneumonia, very serious, especially in the elderly in December and even in November. It means that the virus was circulating at least in Lombardy before we learned about it ""of the Wuhan outbreak made known in January. Over the weekend, various Chinese propaganda organs, including the Global Times and the Chinese embassy in France, used Remuzzi's statement to argue that the pandemic could have started in Italy. ""This is a statement, an insinuation, completely instrumental for internal and external propaganda purposes,"" Prof. Remuzzi. ""There is no doubt, based on genetics, that the virus is Chinese. He described it very well in Science Daniel Lucey, of Georgetown University, who showed all the way traveled by the virus. The first infections occurred in China in November, maybe even earlier. Again, there is no doubt that the virus is Chinese. ""In recent days Remuzzi has been contacted by many Chinese journalists who were looking for confirmation of the alleged Italian origin of the virus."

All he wants is to have overseen a period of peace and prosperity, and genuine militancy endangers the first and eventually both of those two things. He has initiated less foreign military involvement in his time in office than any other president in my lifetime.

""Propaganda virale""

“Altro che italiano, il virus è cinese”. Parla Remuzzi, lo scienziato usato da Pechino come arma di propaganda

* Il Foglio Quotidiano
* 24 Mar 2020

Roma. “Non c’è alcun dubbio che il virus sia cinese. Questo è un esempio da manuale, da insegnare nelle Università, su come si possa manipolare l’informazione scientifica per ragioni di propaganda”. Il professore Giuseppe Remuzzi, direttore dell’Istituto Mario Negri e uno dei più noti scienziati italiani nel mondo, in questi giorni è diventato suo malgrado uno strumento della propaganda di Pechino, che ha diffuso una sua dichiarazione per far credere che l’origine del coronavirus possa essere italiana.

In un’intervista di qualche giorno fa alla National Public Radio americana, Remuzzi aveva dichiarato che alcuni medici della provincia di Bergamo ricordano di aver visto “strane polmoniti, molto gravi, in particolare negli anziani a dicembre e persino a novembre. Significa che il virus circolava almeno in Lombardia prima che venissimo a conoscenza” del focolaio di Wuhan reso noto a gennaio. Nel fine settimana vari organi di propaganda cinesi, tra cui il Global Times e l’ambasciata cinese in Francia, hanno usato la dichiarazione di Remuzzi per sostenere che la pandemia potrebbe essere partita dall’Italia. “Questa è un’affermazione, o un’insinuazione, del tutto strumentale a fini di propaganda interna ed esterna”, dice al Foglio il prof. Remuzzi. “Non c’è alcun dubbio, in base alla genetica, che il virus sia cinese. Lo ha descritto benissimo su Science Daniel Lucey, della Georgetown University, che ha fatto vedere tutta la strada percorsa dal virus. Le prime infezioni sono avvenute in Cina a novembre, forse anche prima. Ripeto, non ci sono dubbi che il virus sia cinese”. In questi giorni Remuzzi è stato contattato da molti giornalisti cinesi che cercavano conferma della presunta origine italiana del virus."

It is being reported, poorly, it seems, and if it becomes bigger news it's gonna scare people. Here's a [link](https://www.axios.com/coronavirus-diamond-princess-cruise-ship-cabins-2c9e13e7-0f45-4847-8ccf-a9b2af4210ca.html) to Axios on it.

Two quotes from the article:
> The bottom line: Per Smith, while SARS-CoV-2 RNA was ""identified on a variety of surfaces in cabins of both symptomatic & asymptomatic infected passengers up to 17 days after cabins were vacated"" and before the vessel had been fully disinfected, ""viral RNA doesn't necessarily mean live virus was present.""

and  
> Of note: A study published last Tuesday in the New England Journal of Medicine found that SARS-CoV-2 stays viable in the air for several hours and can last on surfaces for up to three days.

I'm no Rona expert, but that says to me pieces of the virus could still be found at 17 days. However the live, contagious virus has a shelf life of around 3 days, as previously reported.   

I hope this news gets clarified."

*The president has become increasingly concerned as Dr. Anthony S. Fauci has grown bolder in correcting his falsehoods about the spread of the coronavirus.*

> President Trump has praised Dr. Anthony S. Fauci as a “major television star.” He has tried to demonstrate that the administration is giving him free rein to speak. And he has deferred to Dr. Fauci’s opinion several times at the coronavirus task force’s televised briefings.
> 
> But Dr. Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases since 1984, has grown bolder in correcting the president’s falsehoods and overly rosy statements about the spread of the coronavirus in the past two weeks — and become a hero to the president’s critics because of it. And now Mr. Trump’s patience has started to wear thin.
> 
> So has the patience of some White House advisers, who see Dr. Fauci as taking shots at the president in some of his interviews with print reporters while offering extensive praise for Mr. Trump in television interviews with conservative hosts.
> 
> Mr. Trump knows that Dr. Fauci, who has advised every president since Ronald Reagan, is seen as credible with a large section of the public and with journalists, and so he has given the doctor more leeway to contradict him than he has other officials, according to multiple advisers to the president.
> 
> When Mr. Trump knows that he has more to gain than to lose by keeping an adviser, he has resisted impulses to fight back against apparent criticism, sometimes for monthslong interludes. One example was when he wanted to fire the White House counsel, Donald F. McGahn II, in 2017 and early 2018. Another was Jeff Sessions, the former attorney general. Mr. Trump eventually fired both when he felt the danger in doing so had passed.
> 
> So far, the president appears to be making the same calculation with Dr. Fauci, who was not on the briefing room podium on Monday evening. When asked why, Mr. Trump said he had just been with Dr. Fauci for “a long time” at a task force meeting. Officials, asked about the doctor’s absence, repeated that they were rotating officials who appear at the briefings."

Cuomo (D), President Trump on Tuesday switched gears, sharply criticizing Cuomo over his request for the federal government to send more ventilators to the hard-hit state.

“New York needs 30,000 ventilators,” Cuomo had tweeted earlier Tuesday, following a news conference at which he made the same request. “It will be the difference between life and death. The federal government must provide these ventilators. Only the federal government has the power to deliver.”

Trump chafed at the request during his Fox News Channel town hall.

“We’re building him hospitals, we’re building him medical centers … and he was talking about the ventilators. But he should have ordered the ventilators. And he had a choice; he had a chance,” Trump said of Cuomo.

The president then tried to hand Fox host Bill Hemmer a piece of paper. After Hemmer declined to take the document, citing social distancing, Trump read from it himself. It appeared to be a post about Cuomo on the Gateway Pundit blog, which is known for spreading conspiracy theories.

Later during the interview, Trump sought to prod Deborah Birx, a medical leader on the White House coronavirus task force, to attack Cuomo, as well.

Birx was citing the potential reasons New York City has been a hot spot for coronavirus infections. One reason could be the number of people touching the metal surfaces on the subway, she said; another could be the number of residents who returned from Asia in December.

“Do you blame the governor for that?” Trump interjected with a smirk.

Birx ignored Trump and continued talking.

CDC needs to be broken up into three separate entities and brought out from under the umbrella of HHS.

If we don't do this, we're going to run into future situations where perverse incentive once again comes into play and embedded interests choose to corrupt information to advance their particular agenda.

As far as I'm concerned, holdovers in HHS/CDC have assisted in the perpetration of a biological attack against America for partisan benefit. Washington State and New York/New York City have participated in the plot and coordinated with CDC to conceal case numbers, withhold regularly published data, manipulate data to underrepresent probable cases, and delay testing.

2020-03-24,duisThias,europe,7,https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/fob6xu/denmark_is_implementing_one_of_the_most_radical/fleboqk/,"> Peter Hummelgaard: What we’re trying to do is to freeze the economy.

The problem with doing this globally is that the goods still need to come from somewhere.

I mean, you can have the government borrow money and give that money to workers, and it will avoid layoffs and thus reduce disruption to the economy — okay.

And if it's just Denmark doing it, that works.  Means that Denmark says that she will forego future things if, say, Germany will produce the things that she needs now and trucks them over.

You could maybe shut down the whole world *if you only ever brought down a little bit of it at one time*.

But the problem is that the whole world is getting covid-19 at about the same time.  Your money is worthless if you can't buy anything with it because nobody is making anything to buy.  Either prices from what goods are warehoused skyrocket and the poor can't afford them, even with their wages, or you impose anti-price-gouging rules and just have empty shelves.

Money is just an IOU note, a claim on what resources are available.  A marker.  If there are no goods being made, well, it's a claim on nothing.  It doesn't cause the things that money today can buy to come into existence without workers going in to work.

EDIT: To give a more-concrete example, we just had an article up on the sub a few hours ago, ""[Because of Coronavirus, farmers in Germany are looking for harvest helpers](https://old.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/fo4xv7/because_of_coronavirus_farmers_in_germany_are/)"".  Point is, Germany's not going to be able to do her harvest without 280k workers who had previously come from Eastern Europe, and covid-19 presently poses the possibility of interfering with that.

Now, that's not *actually* a catastrophe if Germany and Germany alone doesn't bring in her harvest.  It would waste some output, would cost Germany something, but at the end of the day, the people who would normally have bought their output can buy food from some other country (*waggles chlorine-washed chicken invitingly*) and if Germany wants to tax non-farmer Germans and have them subsidize farmer Germans so that they don't go out of business and are running next year, she can afford to do it.  The world produces enough food and Germany will produce enough to trade for it down the line that Germans will still eat.

But now imagine that *every farm in the world* shuts down at about the same time for months on end.  Now we're talking about a decidedly-different situation.  Now it's not a matter of trade getting goods from where there is a surplus to where there's a deficit, but a global shortage.  Everyone is trying to buy what stockpiled food is out there.  How long will those last for the entire world?  I don't know, but I doubt that it'd be for a terribly-long period of time."

This was the first positive day that more than outweighed the previous down day.  That typically happens at a short-term turning point.  That means this short-term uptrend has some potential running room compared to any of the previous up days this past 2 months.

So it makes sense to play dips upward until this short-term trend runs its course.

I don't believe the bear market is done yet, but the massive amounts of Fed/Congress stimulus are starting to be a factor in pushing markets up.  There's also the fact that Italy's numbers are decelerating.

The key to everything is how coronavirus infections expand in the US.  Right now markets are hoping that Trump is right that people can start to go back to work/regular life by Easter.

While that's unlikely to be fully true, Trump is basically betting that there won't be another big wave of infections in May if people go back to work in early April.

If you're still looking at bearish plays, I'd wait until we see a lot more upward movement play out (S&P above 2700) or massive outbreaks in other US states (outside of NY/Cali).

The massive amounts of Fed/Congress stimulus are going to make investors more aggressive in buying dips here."

i’m extremely frustrated - my dad and i are showing symptoms but my mom refuses to believe it’s coronavirus, even though we were out in a crowded public place about a week ago. we started showing symptoms 3-4 days ago, and mine seem to be worse than my dads. 

my symptoms are: 
* tightness in the chest (like there are bricks weighing my chest down when breathing) 
* pangs of sharp pain in the chest 
* tickle in the back of my throat 
* loss of appetite 
* extreme dizziness (standing and laying down) 
* low grade fever that comes and goes 
* shivering 
* can’t really taste things as much
* fatigue - can’t seem to stop falling asleep everywhere
* really bad body pain (legs and back mostly) 

we can’t get tested unless we’ve travelled in the last 14 days, which we haven’t. it seems manageable at home and i do feel like i’ll be fine but i’m starting to wonder if these symptoms do mean i should presume myself to be positive or just write it off as everything getting to my head. not asking for medical advice or anything, just want to know what it seems like from an objective position."

It was also interesting to hear Labor's take on the issue asking for more restrictive measures now.

If you think about it, what are people doing now that they're stuck at home? People who got lunch out every day at work aren't doing that, now. They're making meals at home. They're getting into cooking because they have the time, and they want to make their kids brownies. (People aren't panic buying brownies. More people are at home and thinking to themselves, ""hey, maybe I'll try making brownies. I need *something* to do."")

Los Angeles County reached another grim milestone amid the coronavirus pandemic Tuesday when health officials announced the first death of someone younger than 18.

Experts have long said that older people are more susceptible to the virus and that young people in general are less likely to contract the illness. But health officials said Tuesday the death underscores the threat that coronavirus poses to the entire population.

“This is a devastating reminder that COVID-19 affects people of all ages,” L.A. County Public Health Department Director Barbara Ferrer said.

The Health Department was working to confirm how the minor contracted the virus and whether any underlying health issues exacerbated the illness. The agency also is also working to confirm whether the case marks the first such death of a minor linked to coronavirus in the country, but cases are not always broken down by age, said Tim Gilman, a representative for the department. The person lived in Lancaster.

Mayor Eric Garcetti told CNN the victim was a teenager.

The death toll in Los Angeles County now stands at 11.

California coronavirus cases: Tracking the outbreak

According to a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention report released last week, there had been no coronavirus fatalities in the United States of people under 18. The report also said there had been no reported ICU admissions for people under 19.

ADVERTISEMENT

Age breakdowns

Overall, relatively few young people have tested positive in Los Angeles County. But the data show people between the ages of 18 and 65 have tested positive most often. (These number exclude Pasadena and Long Beach):

0-17: 10
18-40: 268
41-65: 250
65+: 107

In Orange County, the numbers are similar:

0-17: 1
18-49: 87
50-64: 41
65+ 23

Here are the statewide age breakdowns, as of Monday:

0-17: 25
18-49: 837
50-64: 442
65+: 415
Unknown age: 14

Child risks

Overall, officials have said young children are at lesser risk than older people for contracting the coronavirus.

One possible reason why babies, toddlers and young children have not been critically threatened is because of their immature immune systems. An undeveloped immune system might prevent the body from triggering inflammation severe enough to result in pneumonia, septic shock or organ failure.

ADVERTISEMENT

A sweeping review of 44,672 lab-confirmed COVID-19 patients in China published in early March by Chinese authorities found that no deaths occurred among anyone younger than 10.

Another study by experts in Wuhan, China — the epicenter of the outbreak — published in the Journal of the American Medical Assn., sought to review all hospitalized infants diagnosed with COVID-19 infection between Dec. 8 and Feb. 6 in China.

By Feb. 6, there had been 31,211 confirmed cases of COVID-19 and 637 fatalities. But the authors could find only nine infected babies who were hospitalized nationwide.

CALIFORNIA

L.A. County reports first death of a coronavirus patient under 18 as COVID-19 cases top 660

March 24, 2020

“None of the nine infants required intensive care or mechanical ventilation or had any severe complications,” the study said.

Four had fever, two had mild upper respiratory tract symptoms and one had no symptoms but tested positive for the virus because of the baby’s exposure to infected family. There were no symptoms available for the other two patients.

And a report published in the World Journal of Pediatrics, summarizing experts’ consensus on the coronavirus in children, also warned that people who have a “silent infection” are among the main sources of transmission for the illness.

“We also should attach importance to asymptomatic cases, which may play a critical role in the transmission process,” the report said. “Respiratory droplets and contact are the main transmission routes. Close contact with symptomatic cases and asymptomatic cases with silent infection are the main transmission routes of [novel coronavirus] infection in children.”

And while children are largely spared the worst effects of the coronavirus, the first reports to document COVID-19 deaths in children make clear that those under 18 are neither immune from infection nor completely spared from becoming very sick.

In China, the novel coronavirus has claimed the lives of a 10-month-old and a 14-year-old, at least.

I only put ""unlikely"" in the title because I knew somebody was going to bring up reinfection. Reinfection can happen with many viruses if the initial infection was not severe, or the body did not mount a sufficient immune response. Reinfection is even known with chicken pox, though it's very rare, and generally speaking it is still true to say that having had chicken pox renders you immune.

We would like to thank you for the March 6, 2020 bulletin from the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), soliciting proposals for developing new or repurposed therapies and vaccines for the novel coronavirus (COVID-19).  Now that Congress has passed a bipartisan supplemental funding package to support COVID-19 preparedness and response efforts across the country, we write to encourage the White House Coronavirus Task Force to ensure that the funding be quickly made available for research, development and review of products to protect the health and safety of the American people includes a strategic effort to develop a variety of treatment options for COVID-19 and COVID-19-related complications – particularly for those individuals who are most vulnerable to the virus.

As of March 20, 2020, more than 200 individuals in the U.S. and 9,840 individuals globally have lost their lives due to COVID-19-related complications, including Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS), with the threat of these numbers continuing to rise unless we respond quickly and meaningfully. ARDS, which can be caused by COVID-19 or other viruses or infectious pathogens, causes fluid to build up in the lungs, restricting oxygen supply to vital organs. Because ARDS can be fatal, we understand that BARDA leadership has proactively reached out to an Ohio-based biotech company that has developed a therapeutic approach that has shown promise in treating ARDS as a way to help bolster our response to COVID-19.
Congress supports BARDA’s leadership in assessing how best to respond to the coronavirus and related conditions and acknowledged the value that new diagnostics, vaccines, and therapeutic options would play in preventing further outbreaks by including more than $3 billion for the research, development, and review of new products that help to protect the health and safety of the American people from COVID-19 in the supplemental funding bill. This total includes more than $2 billion for the Biomedical Advance Research and Development Authority (BARDA) to invest in promising platform-based technologies with U.S-based manufacturing for vaccines and therapeutics. 

The sooner we can develop effective treatment options for those most vulnerable to these complications – including the elderly, the infirmed, those who are immunocompromised, and others – the sooner we can curb the death rate associated with COVID-19. We urge the Task Force and BARDA to use the funding made available by the supplemental to strategically invest in areas that show promise in successfully treating those with COVID-19 induced complications, such as ARDS, and prioritize the U.S.-based manufacturing of any effective therapeutics identified through these efforts. As Congressional representatives for the State of Ohio, we’ve seen first-hand what our Ohio-based biopharmaceutical sector and manufacturing can accomplish, and we look forward to working with you to ensure that the federal government is effectively leveraging resources and partners both Ohio and across the country that are ready to step up and address COVID-19 and its related complications.

We stand ready to work with you to ensure the strategic and efficient implementation of the supplemental funding package to ensure Ohio and those individuals impacted by COVID-19 have the resources and support in place to prevent the further spread of this disease and improve the outcomes associated with the virus.
 
Sincerely,
###"

 omg...  they are working with part truths and misinformation!  I have been confused ever since they said kid's can't catch the virus.  I was  like... what the hell, that aint how viruses work!?!?!?

from this article and the message being spread....

>[Singapore's Education Minister cited evidence that school age kids can't catch the virus from adults](https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/coronavirus-education-minister-ong-ye-kung-responds-to-concerns-on-schools-reopening), rather children contract it from adults.

it  turns out this is totally false... they DO catch it, but the symptoms  are negligible, and they do indeed spread it, it's just the probability is reduced due to not coughing and sneezing everywhere if they are  asymptomatic.  Reading further down this thread, if kids are playing coughing games and challenges... then even this means jack

>**Q** *Why do children seem to be less affected by Covid-19 than adults?*  
**A**  We know that there are other diseases where  children are not affected  as much. For instance, chicken pox is a much  milder illness in children  than in adults.  
And a child with  Hepatitis A (a viral liver disease) probably does  not have symptoms,  but they might have antibodies if you test them,  whereas adults with  Hepatitis A will develop fever and jaundice.  
So,  we know that children and adults have a different sort of immune   system. The children could be - for reasons we do not yet understand -   less likely to have symptoms.  
>  
>**Q** *Should we worry about children passing Covid-19 to the elderly?*  
**A** That is another question we **do not yet know the answer to**. However, if they are asymptomatic, they are less likely to do so.  
>  
>**We have no evidence**  that the child in those family clusters was the first person to get it.    It is more the other way around - the parents have infected the child   and the child is asymptomatic, but you can find (the virus) in their   throat.

'no evidence', as distinct from it never happens.

So  this whole keep kids in school thing appears to be based on a twisted  truth from Singapore's Education minister and seems focused on the lack  of appearance of symptoms, who's strategy is based on freeing up parents  to work and ignoring the issue with kids based on symptoms... NOT an  attempt to stop the spread.

so  basically if you have compromised immune system like some in my  family.... your screwed. Not by bad luck, but by a strategy to slow the  infection rate... not stop it.  It this slowing strategy also surely  condemns a certain percentage of our populace in a way trying to stop or  contain it does not.

\- I am no  medical professional btw, but this is how it appears to me.  Am I wrong though!?!?!?  What little understanding I have of viruses is that  stopping the spread is a must... not just accepting it and trying to  manage the speed and influx of patients which condemns 1% of the populace or whatever that percentage is 

I  would deeply hate to be a teacher at the moment, who at this point are  being treated like soldiers in a war that will have to face some losses  if we are going to get through this.... and that simply aint on!"

The national narrative is set against progressives by a multi-billion dollar Corporate Media Empire in control of what tens of millions of fearful Americans think and feel. #NotMeUs has lost its way and forgotten what **bottom-up** means — along with the power we have if we utilize ourselves in that manner instead of looking to serve a top-down savior. We can still turn this sinking ship around if we finally face our greatest enemy — ourselves.

Too many progressives are talking about what Bernie should do instead of what NotMeUs should do for vital **outreach**. Until progressive shows on Youtube understand this is a *bottom-up* decentralized movement, stop preaching (and complaining) to the choir and instead focusing much more on organizing strategic pans, they are useless for our outreach strategy.

🖨 Acquire used laser printers w/toner any way you can. Print flyers, brochures and pamphlets in the thousands for pennies on the dollar. Put MEMES on the cover and place vital facts inside that the Corporate Media Empire hides from average Americans in order to protect themselves from public ire.

SPREAD EVERYWHERE post-coronavirus, but PREPARE NOW. Get your content ready now. Start looking for used laser printers and paper now. Start printing now. That way as soon as the coronavirus abates WE ATTACK and bring a nationwide, national nightmare to the corrupt. We bring the thing they FEAR the most because it will destroy them. We bring the truth they hide to the public at large.

They censor us on television. They censor and mute our message to the general public on social media. We circumvent that and bring our message directly to the people WHERE THEY ARE in stores and to their doors nationwide. Place vital information on Medicare For All in brochures within the pockets of new clothes at Target. Make humorous Starbucks flyers to place at coffee shops nationwide that let Americans know that MSNBC and FOX News are both lying to them and prove it with facts and evidence they've never been exposed to before.

Let's launch the largest guerrilla marketing attack against the establishment since the American Revolution.

MSNBC, CNN, FOX News and social media corporations control the narrative for tens of millions of voters. Until we circumvent their purposeful misinformation by distributing facts to the public we will always be at their mercy and lose.
🖨 NotMeUs POWER. Use it or lose it. Stop putting faith in Bernie to take on a multi-billion dollar Corp Media Empire hellbent on subjecting you, your family and friends to evil people that put money and power above all humanity.
NotMeUsRevolution Take it to the NEXT LEVEL. PUT YOUR MEMES ON THE TABLE.

Make this icon 🖨 trend online for progressives all over YouTube, Twitter and Facebook to spread awareness that we all need to acquire laser printers and prepare for our guerrilla marketing attack on the system after coronavirus abates. We do this we will change history for the better. Online got us to this point. Now it's time to branch into offline print with just as much (or even more) vigor and 🖨 OUTREACH 🖨 Americans at large."

>For weeks, virologists here have been asked a persistent question: Why, compared to other countries, are so few of the Germans who are diagnosed with the coronavirus dying?  
>  
>In Italy, 9.5 percent of the people who have tested positive for the virus have succumbed to covid-19, according to data compiled at Johns Hopkins University. In France, the rate is 4.3 percent. But in Germany, it’s 0.4 percent.  
>  
>The biggest reason for the difference, infectious disease experts say, is Germany’s work in the early days of [its outbreak](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/europe/germany-coronavirus-merkel/2020/03/18/9f34f2aa-6880-11ea-b199-3a9799c54512_story.html?tid=lk_inline_manual_4&itid=lk_inline_manual_4) to track, test and contain infection clusters. That means Germany has a truer picture of the size of its outbreak than places that test only the obviously symptomatic, most seriously ill or highest-risk patients.  
>  
>“At the beginning, when we had relatively few cases, when it came to finding them and isolating them, we did quite well in Germany,” said Reinhard Busse, head of the department of health care management at the Berlin University of Technology. “That’s the major reason.”  
>  
>Other factors, such as the age of those infected and the timing of Germany’s outbreak, also play a role in the differing death rates. But testing widely has been key. Germany, with 31,150 cases at midday Tuesday, appeared to have a larger outbreak than France, with 20,149. But the higher death rate in France implies there were more undiagnosed cases there. France’s outbreak could be larger than Germany’s.
>
>Germany has not carried out mass testing of the kind employed in countries such as South Korea. But initially, at least, the country’s health authorities tracked infection clusters meticulously. When an individual tested positive, they used contact tracing to find other people with whom they had been in touch and then tested and quarantined them, which broke infection chains.

The only way to stop the virus is to stamp it out, and keep out new embers of contagion from re-igniting the territory.  Germany is doing that, and more relaxed countries can't stand the cost or the medicine."

Washington isn't following Northern Italy for the same reason most of the world isn't following Northern Italy. 

-Milan, capital city of Lombardy where about half of all deaths in Italy are taking place, has a record of decades as the most polluted city of Europe. In fact, the top three most polluted cities in Europe are all Italian. The Po valley is a heavily industrialized valley, where pollution tends to stay ""stuck"".

-Italy has the second oldest population in the world.

-Italians send elderly people to the Intensive Care who we in the Netherlands (my country) would not send to the Intensive Care, because of their conservative Catholic culture, that leads them to attempt to extend someone's life under circumstances where medical practitioners in my country would consider it inhumane.

-Italy has the highest rate of antibiotic resistance in Europe.

-Italy is recording deaths differently from other countries. [Just 12% of coronavirus deaths in Italy have a causal attribution on the death certificate.](https://www.cebm.net/global-covid-19-case-fatality-rates/)

-Italy has a different demographic structure. It's normal for many elderly to live in the same house as their children, rather than retirement homes or other places. This makes heterogeneous quarantine strategies (focusing on isolating vulnerable populations rather than imposing the same measures on everyone) more difficult than in other places.

What goes on in Lombardy is effectively a perfect storm, that receives a disproportionate amount of media attention as a consequence. It's terrible for them and they have my sympathy, but they should not attempt to convince everyone that what is happening in Lombardy is going to happen to the rest of us. The evidence is simply lacking, they are the exception to the rule, rather than the first to fall as the fire and brimstone preachers of /r/coronavirus and /r/worldnews keep arguing."
