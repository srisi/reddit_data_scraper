For comparison, a 0.1% death rate for influenza versus a 3.4% death rate for COVID-19. That is pretty significant and higher than previously touted by a significant margin. Downplaying the risk this virus poses by comparing current deaths (with less than 100,000 people inflected) to annual flu deaths (where millions are inflected) need to stop. It's not a fair comparison.

I really hope everyone is safe out there, and I hope those who are older or immunocompromised are given the compassion they deserve and are not just glossed over. These are people's parents, grandparents, aunts, uncles, brothers, sisters, and loved ones.

It's not a time to panic -- but a time to be cognizant, compassionate, informed, orderly, and prepared. If this virus gets a strong foothold, we will need to be our best selves."

* moved early to communicate in a calm and clear manner to the public, not to incite panic but to involve them in being part of the solution
* got our testing running early, and now hundreds of sites can test throughout the country at high volume
* have really great coordination between the city, county, state and federal levels
* have some plans on the drawing board for public investments and stimulus should they be neccessary
* are investing in helping less developed nations to combat the virus, because as the President stated - ""a virus does not recognize borders. We need to ensure that the global community is prepared to meet this challenge""
* did not cut funding to key government agencies, but rather upped the investment started by the previous administration

For comparison, a 0.1% death rate for influenza versus a 3.4% death rate for COVID-19. That is pretty significant and higher than previously touted by a significant margin. Downplaying the risk this virus poses by comparing current deaths (with less than 100,000 people infected) to annual flu deaths (where millions are infected) need to stop. It's not a fair comparison.

I really hope everyone is safe out there, and I hope those who are older or immunocompromised are given the compassion they deserve and are not just glossed over. These are people's parents, grandparents, aunts, uncles, brothers, sisters, and loved ones.

\- Spread has now become more likely, almost inevitable

\- Unknown when spread will occur, but we expect it is soon. We can only try to slow it down.

\- Travel restrictions, quarantine etc, have bought time so far. But that won't last.

\- When it occurs, they will begin actioning plans that are already in place. The focus must turn to reducing impact and helping to protect people.

\- People should begin to think about how they will respond when spread occurs. Have conversations with friends and families about how they will care for each other. Think about those around them who may be more vulnerable, such as the elderly or sick.

\- Make a plan for how you and your family and pets will manage if you need to stay home for 2-3 weeks

\- Stay at home now, ""if you will""

\- Practice good hand hygiene and cough etiquette, don't touch your face, and use objects to touch lift buttons

\- Wearing masks is not the best preventive measure. They do provide protection when used by those who are already sick.

\- Masks are a precious resource and should be reserved for frontline healthcare workers

\- Best public health advice tells us Coronavirus will be with us for a while

\- We will get through this by caring for and protecting ourselves and others"

- Interesting to note I didn’t catch anything on “risk level” in this call. Lots of uncertainty now. 

- Multiple states have now announced presumptive positive cases:
  - 22/60 cases are travel related 
  - 11/60 cases are person-to-person
  - 27/60 cases are under investigation 

- Heightened concern in Washington state and the outbreak at Kirkland Care Facility.

- Expect to see more cases in the near future as RI, Florida, Georgia, etc announce first cases.

- Healthcare workers and those in close contact (family, co-workers) of infected patients at the greatest risk.

- CDC is “employing an aggressive national commitment to containment” at this time.

- Americans should begin practising social distancing (avoid contact with others).

- Those with any symptoms of illness should self quarantine until they require medical attention (if required) for 14 days.

- Each individual has a role to play in limiting spread and should observe the following practises:
  - Wash hands regularly and thoroughly.
  - Cover your face when coughing or sneezing.
  - Seniors should actively avoid contact with sick people.

- Decisions in what steps are taken is made at the local level. The CDC only provides guidance to localities and states.

- Companies are actively working as quickly as possible to develop drugs and vaccines to mitigate the risk.

- THERE IS NO CLARITY OR CERTAINTY OF THE SCALE OF THE ILLNESS IN AMERICA IN THE COMING WEEKS AND MONTHS.

- “What is happening now in the United States may the beginning of what we are seeing in other countries.”

1. Some countries have no capacity to test
2. Sometimes the testing methods and equipment have failed (this will normalize shortly)
3. Some countries are simply ignoring it (e.g. Indonesia)
4. An increasing amount of countries - developed and developing - are deciding to follow China's lead and hide the true numbers.  I assume they do this in attempts to reduce panic, to reduce economic impact, or to address domestic political problems.  Example countries are China, Japan, Thailand, now Korea, the US Fed-vs-States are arguing about how to censor, Australia etc

The problems I have with point 4 - intentional under-reporting

1. It will cause unnecessary deaths
2. It will cause distrust in government, meaning when government needs to tell people important information in the future people may disregard it
3. It will make it much harder for markets to properly price the costs of the virus, which means we will get larger fluctuations.  This isn't some ""oh no the money"" argument - this relates to companies making the correct decisions to get through the next few months, and if they can't trust the core data then they can't properly make hiring/firing decisions, inventory decisions, etc.  Which really just translates to more lay-offs."

The head of my hospital system's infectious disease and prevention program (among a myriad of other titles) spoke candidly to my class this morning about Covid-19. She told us she's been working with our university's data science and biostatistics team (who are responsible for one of the covid19 trackers linked on this subreddit's sidebar) that is currently working with the White House administration to model the disease in the US.

Yesterday, they informed her the current estimates say if 6 people have died of the disease in Washington, they estimate 60,000 probably have contracted the disease and a further 600,000 have been exposed. The current thought is 60-70% of the US population will contract the disease at some point. Although they also think the case-fatality rate is lower than 2%, probably closer to 0.7%. 

She informed us the state of Virginia currently only has 50 testing kits available, but said our health system would likely develop their own kits within a week or so.

The other thing of note she stated was that the CDC is currently still of the belief that containment of the virus is possible in some manner. She believes within the week they will shift to mitigation.

Apologies if this comes off as alarmist. I also fully acknowledge this is second or third-hand information and can't be confirmed, so some skepticism is appropriate."

''J'ai vu un patient de 50 ans, sportif, sans antécédent. Quand j'ai regardé la radio de ses poumons, j'ai observé des schémas inhabituels par rapport à une simple grippe. Son état s'est dégradé très vite et il a fallu l'intuber, mais il est mort quelques heures après. J'ai l'impression qu'en plus du coronavirus, les patients sont touchés par une sorte de myocardite \[NDLR : inflammation du muscle cardiaque\] virale, car l'attaque contre le coeur paraît particulièrement forte et rapide.''"

I think it’s pretty well-documented and known that community spread has been taking place around the country, yet they are still using the old testing criteria? I am just baffled that we aren’t testing possible cases that present around the state, regardless of the travel history.

My mom is very elderly and while she's doing pretty great for someone in her 90s, no doubt she's seriously at-risk. Fortunately, she's in her own place nearby, so we've hatched a plan to let her stay holed up for the duration while we deliver everything she needs. Obviously, she doesn't like it but we're trying to help by joking about catching up on her Netflix queue and the kids are wiping down their PS4 and donating it to grandma for the duration.

I did earn my PhD in biochemistry from the University of Washington developing software in Rosetta (the backend on which foldit is built) and was part of the team that solved the first structure of a coronavirus spike protein [https://www.nature.com/articles/nature16988](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature16988) and elucidated the glycan shield it uses to evade the immune system [https://www.nature.com/articles/nsmb.3293](https://www.nature.com/articles/nsmb.3293)

Mind an open discussion doesn't come free and the responsibility is placed among the rest of us to ensure that differing opinions are voiced. If there is no proof (myriad of it) to state that something must be deleted because ""conspiracy"", then there is no reason for it to be so. To allow truly open discourse doesn't come without provocation to fear and rumor. Fake news is a term I do not like because it is a box that can be placed subjectively almost on anything, however I wouldn't keep the term away from the discussion because it is a term one can choose to use but to erase a voice is another matter entirely. I believe even for the seemingly crazy, it would be better to follow the crumbs on a supposedly laid out conspiracy thread and dig to see whether or not it clearly leads to something needing more attention.

Trevor Bedford’s lab at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in Seattle, which studies viral evolution, concluded there is “firm evidence” that, at least in Washington State, the coronavirus had been spreading undetected for weeks. Now different projections estimate that 20 to 1,500 people have already been infected in the greater Seattle area. In California, too, the disease appears to be spreading, although the limited testing means that no one is quite sure how far.

>In total, fewer than 500 people have been tested across the country (although the CDC has stopped reporting that number in its summary of the outbreak). As a result, the current “official” case count inside the United States stood at 43 as of Tuesday morning (excluding cruise ship cases). This number is wrong, yet it’s still constantly printed and quoted. In other contexts, we’d call this what it is: a subtle form of misinformation.


>This artificially low number means that for the past few weeks, we’ve seen massive state action abroad and only simmering unease domestically. While Chinese officials were enacting a world-historic containment effort—putting more than 700 million people under some kind of movement restriction, quarantining tens of millions of people, and placing others under new kinds of surveillance—and American public-health officials were staring at the writing on the wall that the disease was extremely likely to spread in the U.S., the public-health response was stuck in neutral. The case count in the U.S. was not increasing at all. Preparing for a sizable outbreak seemed absurd when there were fewer than 20 cases on American soil. Now we know that the disease was already spreading and that it was the U.S. response that was stalled.

>Meanwhile, South Korean officials have been testing more than 10,000 people a day, driving up the country’s reported-case count. Same goes for Italy: high test rate, high number of cases. (Now
some Italian politicians want to restrict testing.) In China, the official data say the country has more than 80,000 cases, but the real number might be far, far higher because of all the people who had mild(er) cases and were turned away from medical care, or never sought it in the first place. That may be cause for reassurance (though not everyone agrees), because the total number of cases is the denominator in the simple equation that yields a fatality rate: deaths divided by cases. More cases with the same number of deaths means that the disease is likely less deadly than the data show.

>The point is that every country’s numbers are the result of a specific set of testing and accounting regimes. Everyone is cooking the data, one way or another. And yet, even though these inconsistencies are public and plain, people continue to rely on charts showing different numbers, with no indication that they are not all produced with the same rigor or vigor. This is bad. It encourages dangerous behavior such as cutting back testing to bring a country’s numbers down or slow-walking testing to keep a country’s numbers low.

>The other problem is, now that the U.S. appears to be ramping up testing, the number of cases will grow quickly. Public-health officials are currently cautioning people not to worry as that happens, but it will be hard to disambiguate what proportion of the ballooning number of cases is the result of more testing and what proportion is from the actual spread of the virus.
People trust data. Numbers seem real. Charts have charismatic power. People believe what can be quantified. But data do not always accurately reflect the state of the world. Or as one scholar put it in a book title: “Raw Data” Is an Oxymoron.

>The reality gap between American numbers and American cases is wide. Regular citizens and decision makers cannot rely on only the numbers to make decisions. Sometimes quantification actually obscures as much as it reveals."
