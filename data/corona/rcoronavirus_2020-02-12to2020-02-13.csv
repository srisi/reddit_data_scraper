Say you eat a chocolate bar and you've got chocolate smudges on your fingers. Do you wash your hands to kill the chocolate? Or simply to remove it and wash it away?

Antibacterial soap can of course kill bacteria, but the mechanics of the soap & water actually cleaning and removing the virus off of your skin and washing it away is what is important

Edit: adding - soap does not kill a virus, but using hand sanitizer or even isopropyl alcohol on your hands will. It's a good idea to use hand sanitizer after you wash them"

2020-02-12,Otadiz,Coronavirus,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/f2xshc/coronavirus_test_kits_sent_to_states_30_countries/fhfcwns/,"""Some of the coronavirus testing kits sent to states and to at least 30 other countries have flaws and do not work properly, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said on Wednesday.

The kits were meant to enable states to conduct their own testing and get results faster than they would by shipping samples to the C.D.C. in Atlanta. But the failure of the kits means that states still have to depend on the C.D.C., which will mean several days’ delay in getting results.

The C.D.C. announced last week that it had begun shipping about 200 kits to laboratories in the United States and roughly 200 more to labs in more than 30 other countries. Each kit can test about 700 to 800 specimens from patients, the agency said.

Officials have not said how many of the kits are flawed.

On trial runs in some states, the kits produced results that were “inconclusive,” Dr. Nancy Messonnier, director of the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, said at a news conference on Wednesday.

“Things may not always go as smoothly as we may like,” Dr. Messonnier said.

She said the C.D.C. was working closely with the states, and would send out new ingredients to laboratories that have encountered the problem.

There have been 13 confirmed cases of the infection in patients in the United States so far. About 850 evacuees have been quarantined at military bases after returning from China. Still others are under self-quarantine at their homes.

The flawed test kits are a separate issue from the mislabeled samples in San Diego that led officials to discharge from the hospital a woman who was sick from the coronavirus.

More than 1,100 people have died, nearly all of them in China, where there are more than 44,000 confirmed cases.""

Of course it can all be solved. If it causes hepatitis maybe it's because of the ACE2 expression on the liver. Mutate the S protein a bit so it doesn't bind ACE2 anymore.

If it directs the immune system to a type 2 response (allergic response) we can add adjuvants that prevent that.

The problem is if the classic inactivated vaccine has issues we will lose months until superior vaccines are in trial.

Here in the US they’re only testing those that have travelled to China recently or had contact with those who have. So how do you know if you’ve had contact with someone that’s been in China recently? There’s no way for you to know if you have if you’ve been out in public. They also didn’t test people coming from China for more than a month so how many people fell through the cracks? The CDC is preparing for community transmission and many other experts from reputable sources think community transmission is inevitable.

I threw the one straight from Wuhan away cus I knew I wouldn’t use it, and the first item I got months ago. Plus it cost only like 12 bucks. The other one I’m not sure the name of the city, but it is another town nonetheless. I’m not opening that one for 2 weeks. I took the package, put in a ziplock bag, and put that in a grocery bag, after using disenfectant wipes. I also  Lysol sprayed stuff that could have touched the packages. I’ve heard hours. Hope it’s not 28 days. If you know after 14 days if you are infected or not, I feel 2 weeks is reasonable for inanimate objects. Especially if it’s only hours after contact.

The only reason I’m not throwing the second away is cus I actually want that product and wouldn’t be buying it again from China any time soon. I feel I’m safer just hanging on to this item than I am buying it in a month. The virus wasn’t very widespread when I bought it where as it’s more spread now lol."

The NHS IS underprepared for this, but with a caveat. The flu generally clogs up the majority of hospitals, particularly in the north, every year, without fail. The result of this is that elective surgeries are cancelled to free up beds and isolation wards. Add another huge burden onto this, then yes, there will be trouble.

The caveat is that this influx of inpatients declines very quickly after March, so I would say that the NHS is underprepared for a few months. 

Now, I have been speaking with colleagues in the last week or so, and what I would suggest is that people don’t panic. I’m all for information sharing, but I do believe that this sub is getting somewhat extreme; as it stands, we don’t know how widespread this is or will be yet. We’ve reacted much faster than China with regards to quarantining, meaning this *should* slow the spread at least. 

In which case, assuming the winter measures caused by flu are behind us, then we *may* be equipped to deal with this from an NHS perspective. 

I don’t think there’s anything wrong with preparing, but panic never ever solved anything."

As for worry, I'm millenial, non smoker, non-asmatic, I'm not worried for me or my wife. I am however worried I'll pass it on, seeing as I travel internationally quite often, I'm worried if I pass it to my wife she'll kill half the people in the local hospital (mostly old people) and then there's the very serious concern for my elders who are in the high risk group.

  


Wahing your hands has to be followed up by disinfectant, at work you can't avoid people in open offices, nor in airports mostly international in big corporations, still without a mask and goggles you will be infected and won't even know until it's too late, and even then no country tests for it if you haven't been to Wuhan in the last 2 weeks, since they don't have the capacity a PCR test is hard to do takes professional lab staff and takes about 9 hours plus shipment, with very poor precision"

“Things may not always go as smoothly as we may like,” Dr. Messonnier said.

By [Denise Grady](https://www.nytimes.com/by/denise-grady)

* Feb. 12, 2020 Updated 3:41 p.m. ET

Some of the coronavirus testing kits sent to states and to at least 30 other countries have flaws and do not work properly, the Centers for Disease  Control and Prevention said on Wednesday.

The  kits were meant to enable states to conduct their own testing and get results faster than they would by shipping samples to the C.D.C. in  Atlanta. But the failure of the kits means that states still have to depend on the C.D.C., which will mean several days’ delay in getting  results.

The C.D.C. [announced last week](https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2020/p0206-coronavirus-diagnostic-test-kits.html) that it had begun shipping about 200 kits to laboratories in the United  States and roughly 200 more to labs in more than 30 other countries.  Each kit can test about 700 to 800 specimens from patients, the agency said.

Officials have not said how many of the kits are flawed.

On trial runs in some states, the kits produced results that were  “inconclusive,” Dr. Nancy Messonnier, director of the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, said at a news conference on  Wednesday.

“Things may not always go as smoothly as we may like,” Dr. Messonnier said.

She  said the C.D.C. was working closely with the states, and would send out new ingredients to laboratories that have encountered the problem.

There have been 13 confirmed cases of the infection in patients in the United  States so far. About 850 evacuees have been quarantined at military bases after returning from China. Still others are under self-quarantine at their homes.

The flawed test kits are a separate issue from the [mislabeled samples](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/11/us/san-diego-coronavirus-patient.html) in San Diego that led officials to discharge from the hospital a woman who was sick from the coronavirus.

More than 1,100 people have died, nearly all of them in China, where there are more than 44,000 confirmed cases."

These things are adapted to animals, it is random how well they will spread in humans.  Eventually, it was no surprise that we got one that spread rapidly.

People are getting the incorrect impression whites are immune because Western sanitation means reinfection while under special care isn't likely. 

If they catch it again they will get blown the fuck out and as more people catch it reinfection becomes more common.

I think I understand why China had sparse cases that weren't a big deal for a month or two before everything went to shit. its only truly dangerous on reinfection and when there are only a few people sick the odds of getting reinfected are low. The first phase which everyone spreads and gets over is flu like and not a big deal. It will spread through a population and make everyone sick and think nothing of it. The second phase is reinfection where people further down the line infect the people who were previously infected. This leads to the more severe symptoms and cases. 

Because of sanitary conditions in China and lack of protocol people are getting reinfected as soon as they get over the first part of it. It all starts to make sense if you consider that the ones dying or requiring care are people who are getting it a second time. It explains the way it spread without doing any real damage for more than a month but suddenly became a problem when the second wave of it was coming back around.

Full martial law conditions so if you are a criminal you better lay low.

2-4 weeks shelter in place would reduce the spread greatly IMO. Food and medication distribution would also be critical as there will be people who need it. There will be a spectrum, with a few people needing food delivery often (or even mental health hospitalization) and others you can just drop off some dried foodstuffs like oil, oats and whey protein and leave them to it while still others will be prepared all on their own.

We have an instant communication system and advanced delivery networks already. This is not 1918 we can take this on if we are smart about it. And we are smart.

This is a mindless enemy we are at war with.

The concerning thing is the rate at which this infection spreads and the number of severe cases.

Going by the official numbers this still paints a desperate picture if a mass outbreak occurs.

Not only would there be an overload of medical facilities to treat severe cases, but there would also be shortages of medical treatment supplies.

Even if you were not seriously ill mass panic would also see a massive run on supplies in consumer goods.

And mass quarantine would disrupt supply lines which would further disrupt the flow of normal commerce.

This has the potential to become a major global crisis that affects a significant portion of the world's population.

Don't get me wrong, I am not saying the world will end, that this virus will eradicate humanity.

But I am saying it is dangerous enough to cause a major impact in a lot of lives and disrupt moderns standards of living for several months.

And that is with the official numbers.

I don't need conspiracy speculation to be concerned about this virus."

This of course leaves a bit of a grey area, about what we can consider misinformation our not, and we are trying to establish clear guidelines about this as well.

On the other hand, my local colleague cough and sneeze like crazy but no one bat an eye. He never wear a mask, why? Do western ppl also have pressure to put on their masks? Do they concern if ppl will be scared that they are sick? But they are! 

I think western ppl could be less sensitive and more rational about wear masks.

Just because someone wear masks doesn’t necessarily mean that they are sick.

It’s scary to think about It but if our sole focus is constantly on the Coronavirus we may as well isolate ourselves in the house! 

The best thing is to be vigilant when in public and make sure you are cleaning your hands regularly. Whenever I went somewhere I’d make sure to use a hand sanitizer, wear gloves (cold weather) put a scarf over my mouth. 
I know it’s not the most effective approach but I’m not going to let this virus stop me from living my life. I still need to get to work, go on public transport etc... 

When I went back to Budapest Airport I saw a group of Chinese people all wearing face masks, it is scary and a worry but so far I feel ok and trying to make sure my hands are at least as clean as they can be or if I randomly touch my face. 

Please don’t let this stop you from travelling, the world goes on."

Do you have kids? How would you feel if you watched that video where the preschool-aged child was being loaded into a body bag? Wouldn't you look at your kids and realize that it could easily be them being zipped into that bag?

We all have different circumstances in this world. Some of us are poor. Some of us are old. Some of us are sick. Some of us have others that depend on us for survival. It's very easy to extrapolate what's happening in Asia right now to other places, or even our own countries.

I'm not asking you to sympathize with every single person that comes in here posting things that sound alarmist. I'm also not asking you to reconsider your stance that people are doomsaying. What I am asking is for you to take a step back and understand that people are not posting these things because they want to spread fear or make others feel anxious. Many of these people see what's happening and understand the very real possibility that one day, it could be *their* baby going into that body bag. A mother or a father should never have to experience that, but right now, it's happening. Maybe that occurrence is in China. Maybe it'll be in Laos tomorrow, or the Philippines this weekend.

However, real, honest, true terror doesn't know geography or borders. It doesn't know race, and it doesn't know age. It taps deep into our psyche and touches the things that we hold to be the most precious. That's what people are worrying, and that's okay. Don't be annoyed or angry with it. Support them. Reassure them if you feel like it. But ultimately, just be mindful and heartful."

If this is the case, then it does show at least something - that we don't really have a handle on how many people are actually infected. Which could be good for the case fatality rate (which we also really have no idea about...)   


Depending on whether the deaths are taking into account the backlog, or using some new method of accountancy, the true daily death rate may have been \~200-300 a day before this.

Even going by the official numbers the outlook is still grim.

The concerning thing is the rate at which this infection spreads and the number of severe cases.

Going by the official numbers this still paints a desperate picture if a mass outbreak occurs.

Not only would there be an overload of medical facilities to treat severe cases, but there would also be shortages of medical treatment supplies.

&#x200B;

Even if you were not seriously ill mass panic would also see a massive run on supplies in consumer goods.

And mass quarantine would disrupt supply lines which would further disrupt the flow of normal commerce.

I'm eligible for a free flu jab because of underlying health problems but I've only bothered to get it maybe 4 years out of the last 10, because I'm relatively young and never considered flu a proper threat. 

I've changed my mind. 

Firstly, I think I did actually contract flu last December. I didn't die, obviously, but my already-not-so-great kidneys might have taken a hit.

Secondly (but most importantly), herd immunity. I never really considered that an elderly person might actually die because I didn't take a couple of hours out of work to immunise myself.

Thirdly, I never considered the complication of a novel virus making the rounds, adding patients to already full hospitals dealing with preventable cases of flu, resulting in deaths that would otherwise be lives.

It would be dealt with by setting up separate facilities dedicated to looking after people who have COVID19 and are in serious condition. 

Already we've been told that if you think you have COVID then you do not go to a hospital. In the U.K people have been instructed to stay at home and phone 111.

The general plan for a dangerous epidemic in the U.K is that you quarantine yourself and get a code for a test kit which someone else picks up and puts through your letterbox and then test yourself. People who become severely ill will be picked up and taken to a quarantine for care.

The NHS day-to-day is really a separate thing. Some staff will be drained from it to help with COVID outbreak if it becomes widespread, but what needs to be mobilised for dealing with COVID will be done so. People severely misunderstand the issues with the NHS and its day-to-day problems, which is primarily problems with inefficiency and resource-management. U.K is one of the last countries in the world to run out of resources to just deal with lots of sick people. Should worry about developing countries such as Africa and much of Asia, not highly developed and advanced countries in the western world."

There are far more global implications to this than you seem to grasp.  Let's put the ""deadly world wide plague"" outcome aside for a moment and consider some of the other ripple effects that might impact you, a family member or someone you know.

Like it or not, the fact remains that China is a major producer of nearly every consumer item you purchase.  From cell phones to cars to clothing and everything else.  Those factories have shut down.  
A lack of car parts means, auto workers are out of work.  So are mechanics.  Retail stores will have stock shortages, this results in lower sales.. people will lose their jobs.. What are the dock workers going to unload where there are no cargo ships coming into port? (there are tons of other examples of of this).

Even temporally, this will have a real impact and create hardship for lots of families.  Any interruption to a nations supply chain will have a significant negative impact to their economy - and you are part of that economy. 

Even if this all went away today, those factories have been shut for weeks.  It will take them another week or so to get back to 100% production, then add in packaging, warehousing  and shipping time.  It will take 6 weeks or more for those goods will finally get to market.

For many people, going a month or two without a paycheck will be devastating.

But, this isn't going away today.  It may be weeks or months before this resolves itself.  Not preparing, the best you can, for what is coming is just foolish.

Try to have some perspective instead of insulting people.  It only shows your lack of awareness."

Also, even if it becomes a pandemic, it's not gonna break out everywhere at once, and not every outbreak is gonna be the same. I highly doubt the situation in Wuhan is gonna repeat itself in western countries.

It would basically be like having a really really bad flu season every year. Honestly i'm more worried about production chains collapsing and a stock market crash than i am about this virus.

I'm in Austria of course, so it's easy to be relaxed, in developing or third world countries this could wreak havoc, not debating that."

Also, there is this perceived notion that most people know jack squat about medicine or other subjects. In this regard, they are mostly right. The problem is that they over generalize. Since, come on, we also know there is a huge trend for people to self-diagnose, too. I mean, I have encountered more people who claim to have a dated a sociopath or a narcissist, as if it was something to be proud of. As if they could diagnose someone. 

The other issue I see is based to where they stand in society. We would look weird if a cop started to act like a coward. In the same token, Doctors also are aware that they have to retain a certain aspect of stoicism, if not due to their education, then to their position in society and lastly, because it is implied in their job role. So, they are more likely to remain skeptical. I mean, look at Reddit here, there are people who are claiming to be getting anxious and depressed over the Corona Virus, or of reading the news. That is not very rational either. 

This is not to take away from your point. I have a number of friends who are doctors and alas for one, I have not even talked to them about it, as I already half expect for one of them to look at me funny for being aware of shit before they are.  There is also the fact that the Corona Virus is new. Look, our grandparents lived in a time of Polio, Malaria, Influenza, just to name a few, and they would just come in and cripple you or kill you.   

Most of us --except for people in the 3rd world-- have not been raised to know how to handle this. Most people have apocalyptic movies and the Walking Dead to go by. No one wants to act like any of those characters so again, they will keep it on the down low publicly until the very last moment. 

The one Doctor friend I have spoken to, has told me in private that is scared. Since she works at a hospital and she sees people day in and day out. We only have a handful of cases in our city and statistically the risk is very, very low. But at least she is admitting to act human but at her job? Nothing of it shows, because she can't allow it to, otherwise, she would not be doing the best possible job. Which I think is part of the reason you feel that way. As they come off as being indifferent or apathetic. Even though we are seeing all of this happening. 

Lastly, I have two friends who literally have stated and I quote, ""I am not worried about the virus. The common flu kills far more people each year."" To be even more frustrating if you allowed it to get under your skin."

The WHO knows that the travel restrictions and quarantine activity may be unpalatable, but they agree that it buys TIME.

Its no different with the seasonal flu, the speed and virility of it spread out the bubble as it makes its way through the health care system and the population.

Which is why Covid is so dangerous, ""if the levy breaks"" you have precisely defined how the health care system will snap, and thereby the population. 

Right now, the levy shows SOME positive signs of holding, through mass information sharing, minor panic and overreaction.  

The levy concept is real, we are poking our fingers in the dike that could burst, trying to buy time to add capacity to all the things required and ultimately make the vaccine. 

With the era of the Internet, social media and the breakthroughs of Science in recent years, this might be our new MO for pandemic/epidemics.  

Build and hold the levy against the virus until we can make the vaccine or stop it using all the channels available.

They are certain that there are unconfirmed cases currently spreading in the US and it's just a matter of time before clusters break out. Also that we should prepare for thousands or even hundreds of thousands of cases in the US. [DHS roundtable](https://www.hsgac.senate.gov/are-we-prepared-protecting-the-us-from-global-pandemics). See around 2:07:10 and 1:56:30. It's worth watching the whole thing though."

I’d be so appreciative of a boss like you. There are a lot of viruses going around like RSV and influenza on top of the novel coronavirus. People don’t think about who they can possibly spread these to, such as workers that have vulnerable family members at home like immune compromised, Infants, elderly etc. I wish companies had better policies for sick days etc."

However, you don't just need any beds. You need Quarantine-rooms. And you have about 50 of those. Maxing out at 500 in all over Brittain, as told by the NHS.

&#x200B;

 ""In the Commons, the Health Secretary Matt Hancock said: ""The NHS has the capability now to cope with the very highest level of intensity and isolation with 50 cases and the capability to expand that to 500 cases and to do that without an impact on the wider work of the NHS.

""But, of course, if the number of cases get bigger, then we will need to take further steps... there are extensive plans already in place for how that should happen if we reach that eventuality.""

Would love to ask the Director or Writer if it was an accident is all.  I think the general movie audience needs simple films like Contagion, not every film needs to be Citizen Kane.  

As i get older it seems I can't seem to enjoy as many PG-13 films.   I think more of them in the modern age play it a bit too safe and its just not as entertaining to me anyway.  If i saw the rating before my first viewing I wouldn't have started it.  Serious subjects should be rated R and should be allowed to breath with what that rating gives.   Imagine if ""Saving Private Ryan"" wasn't rated R.   War films tend to be better if they are rated R as a general rule,  I think Infection films might also fall into that category for me."

2020-02-12,TooCoolX,Coronavirus,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/f3030i/virus_life_on_hard_goods/fhfs4b6/,As with any organism it will vary on conditions. Temperature and humidity are big factors as that prolongs longevity. This particular strain is problematic in more ways than one. Most importantly the aerosol factor. Droplets small enough to become airborne can travel up to .6 miles or more. One droplet on any mucus membrane you got it. Currently at the epicenter of outbreak weather conditions are optimal for the virus to spread. Then add in all the other ‘flu type strains’ transmission routes and it packs a mighty punch. The term ‘super carriers’ is probably more common then everyone thinks. The months ahead will really clearly show what our global conditions will be. This could easily surpass the Spanish Flu for fatalities
