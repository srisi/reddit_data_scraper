As for other cases, again it would be unusual for a child or adult to have a mystery undiagnosed terminal illness and die from it the same time they caught the virus. 

Even those people who had underlying health conditions, they still developed pneumonia, had to go on a ventilator, quickly deteriorated and died from organ failure. Sure they’re underlying condition made them more vulnerable, but they still died from complications caused by the virus.

I don’t think anyone is dying from something else, and they just happen to have the virus.

Usually the media reports details of deaths, I have yet to see ‘John, who was days from death because of stomach cancer, tested positive for coronavirus but died of cancer before he developed any virus symptoms).

I think we can say with pretty much certainty  that anyone who has it, is hospitalised for it, and has to go on a ventilator and dies from lung or heart failure - it was the virus."

2020-03-29,Martinspire,facepalm,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/facepalm/comments/fqas01/a_little_perspective/fltklsw/,"> CDC's worst-case projection

Which is only as good as the stuff you put in, but even so:

https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2020/03/cdcs-worst-case-coronavirus-model-210m-infected-1-7m-dead.html

>Per the Times, the model was one of four presented by CDC disease modeler Matthew Biggerstaff which reflected different assumptions about the nature of the coronavirus and the possible U.S. response. The projections also suggested that a U.S. epidemic could lead to the hospitalization of anywhere from 2.4 million to 21 million people. Depending on the timing, that burden could devastate the U.S. health-care system, as U.S. hospitals only have a capacity of roughly 925,000 beds (and fewer than 100,000 beds for critically ill patients). The Times reported that experts said the U.S. epidemic could last “months or even over a year, with infections concentrated in shorter periods, staggered across time in different communities.” 

So it depends on how fast those 21 million are going to need hospital care. So the maximum would be somewhere below 21 million, not 1.7.

Also:

>The four scenarios have different parameters, which is why the projections range so widely. They variously assume that each person with the coronavirus would infect either two or three people; that the hospitalization rate would be either 3 percent or 12; and that either 1 percent or a quarter of a percent of people experiencing symptoms would die. Those assumptions are based on what is known so far about how the virus has behaved in other contexts, including in China.

I think that the model they presented at March 13 needs some adjusting, seeing how it is playing out now. We can already see that the 1% casualties is pretty much a given now. And that many need medical care, which leads to lots of hospital beds being taken at the same time.

To top it off, if the US removes measures and pretends it is all ok, that number will skyrocket."

Changes in human behaviour should be the biggest factor in restricting the spread of infection.

The experience of countries in more tropical climates suggests that warmer weather in itself is not sufficient to prevent or reduce the severity of an outbreak. 

The article you linked mentions at many points that there still isn't enough data on novel coronavirus, and how seasonality might be a much smaller factor than in other endemic flus.  How long a virus survives on a surface might sound great but perhaps the spread now is driven by close personal contact, which makes enivronmental factors moot."

But what about more exotic forms of corporate welfare if those measures aren’t enough? 

Some sectors have been quick to stake claims for additional alms, such as the US airlines and the aircraft maker Boeing, whose hardship pleas were rewarded by bumper packages of $50bn for the carriers and another $150bn earmarked for other “distressed sectors”. In Britain, the entrepreneur, Richard Branson, has suggested the UK aviation industry might need an extra £7.5bn to tide it over the shutdown. How should governments go about assessing such claims?

The first thing they must do is to avoid any whiff of caving into special pleading. How such things are viewed in hindsight is important. 

It doesn’t matter that the most affected companies aren’t responsible for creating the present crisis in the way the banks were with their toxic assets a decade ago. There should be no repetition of the unsavoury aroma left by the 2008-9 US bailouts where, writes Nassim Taleb, “[bankers who lost more money than ever earned in the history of banking](https://medium.com/incerto/corporate-socialism-the-government-is-bailing-out-investors-managers-not-you-3b31a67bff4a), received the largest bonus pool in the history of banking less than two years later”.

Loan packages should come with clear conditions that preclude such outcomes, and also stipulate continuance of service and employment (for workers, not bosses). And while it’s true they must be kept simple to ensure they can be implemented quickly, there should be no free pass for existing investors. Additional assistance should only come if the state receives an equity stake.

Some think the taxpayer might actually benefit from providing this form of relief. Not simply because it is in the wider social interest to sustain both employment and sound businesses, according to a recent paper published by the Institute of Public Policy Research. The authors argue that it [could also be profitable for the taxpayer](https://www.ippr.org/research/publications/beyond-bailouts).

Share prices in many particularly affected sectors have slumped. Airlines, for instance, have lost 50-66 per cent of their market value since the start of the year. Meanwhile, many governments enjoy a historically low cost of capital. For instance, the UK government can issue 10 year bonds at a nominal yield of 0.5 per cent (equivalent to negative 1.5 per cent in real terms).

This makes the provision of assistance a very different act from bailing out “lame ducks”, the authors argue. It is an opportunity for the state, using ultra cheap capital, to acquire “stakes in fundamentally very strong businesses whose short-term operations have temporarily ground to a halt due to a health emergency”.

However seductive this idea, however, ministers should beware trying to play Warren Buffett. There’s no reason to believe the UK state should be any more lucky on its bets than the US Treasury, which ended $10bn out of pocket on its $80bn [bailout of the American car industry](https://www.thebalance.com/auto-industry-bailout-gm-ford-chrysler-3305670) at the nadir of 2009. Britain still owns a big stake in NatWest (aka Royal Bank of Scotland) nearly 12 years on.

The objectives of any programme should be confined to helping solely those that cannot help themselves, as well as applying tough conditions to assistance. Consequently there will necessarily be an element of adverse selection: only the worst need apply! This could well also limit excess returns. 

The UK government has already indicated wisely that it [will not offer sector wide packages](https://www.ft.com/content/0ef2e802-6ddd-11ea-9bca-bf503995cd6f) of the sort seemingly favoured by Sir Richard and the Airport Operators’ Association. There is surely little point in forcing funds on, say, IAG, the owner of British Airways, which has not joined the clamour for help, if it does not want them. 

The US banks may all have been forced to accept state help a decade ago (Britain’s were allowed to seek private alternatives if they could find them). But that was about shoring up confidence in the financial system and not stigmatising individual institutions. No such imperative applies with commercial enterprises today.

There are long-term lessons to learn from this crisis. Pandemics are not “black swan” events, but ones that pose the foreseeable risk of periodic interruptions. Bailouts of companies that utilise excessive leverage or arrange their affairs operationally to maximise returns are another form of moral hazard.

But ministers should keep their eyes on the main objective, which is to protect employees through a lockdown whose length and severity we cannot yet know.

The headlines may scream that this changes everything, but nothing as yet is certain. There will be time for wider policy changes. But for now it should be service continuation and employees first."

And that turned out to be a good decision.  I ordered sweeping travel restrictions, increased travel advisory levels, established screening measures, and imposed historic quarantines.  We have quarantines all over the country — a lot of them.

>The coronavirus shows the importance of bringing manufacturing back to America so that we are producing, at home, the medicines and equipment and everything else that we need to protect the public’s health.  And I’ve been talking about this for a long time.  That process has already started.  It started long before we ever knew about this.

>We want to make certain things at home.  We want to be doing our manufacturing at home.  It’s not only done in China; it’s done in many other places, including Ireland, and a lot of places make our different drugs and things that we need so badly.  And it’s not good to be dealing with one or two or three countries.  And we do very little at home, and we’re going to start doing it at home, and we’ve been talking about that for a long time.  And a lot of the drug companies, because of what we’ve done in terms of incentives and taxes, they’re heading back here anyway.

>The coronavirus shows the importance of bringing all of that manufacturing back to America, and we will have that started.  It’s already started, frankly.  It started about a year ago.

To emphasize, **""The coronavirus shows the importance of bringing all of that manufacturing back to America, and we will have that started.  It’s already started, frankly.  It started about a year ago.""**

No president has suggested that the research of the flu should be 'brought back' to ""bring back"" the manufacturing of a cure back to America. 

>THE PRESIDENT:  Well, this was unexpected.  This was something that came out of China, and it hit us and many other countries.  You look at the numbers; I see the numbers with just by watching you folks.  I see it — it’s over 100 different countries.  And it hit the world.

>And we’re prepared, and we’re doing a great job with it.  And it will go away.  Just stay calm.  It will go away.

>We want to protect our shipping industry, our cruise industry, cruise ships.  We want to protect our airline industry — very important.  But everybody has to be vigilant and has to be careful.

>But be calm.  It’s really working out.  And a lot of good things are going to happen.  The consumer is ready, and the consumer is so powerful in our country with what we’ve done with tax cuts and regulation cuts and all of those things.  The consumer has never been in a better position than they are right now.

Again, **""And it will go away.  Just stay calm.  It will go away.""... ""But be calm.  It’s really working out.  And a lot of good things are going to happen.""**

The country is calm, we sit in our homes waiting for this to pass. What is the problem?"

Da würde ich gerne Merkel fragen, aber die hat im Moment sicher besseres zu tun. ;-)

Regierungschefs haben ja Mittel und Wege Kaninettsmitglieder kaltzustellen, wenn sie den Herausforderungen nicht gewachsen sind - beispielhaft zu sehen gerade in Bayern:

>Das Gesundheitsministerium hat in den vergangenen Tagen einen bemerkenswerten Zuwachs an Spitzenpersonal verzeichnet: einen Staatssekretär (Gerhard Eck, leihweise aus dem Innenressort) und einen zweiten Amtschef (Winfried Brechmann). Nun ist das Gesundheitsministerium ein eher kleines Haus, das im Krisenbetrieb durchaus Verstärkung vertragen kann. Und doch ist es wohl nicht zu verwegen, an den ungewöhnlichen Wechseln die These festzumachen, dass Markus Söders Vertrauen in die Führungsstärke seiner Gesundheitsministerin Grenzen hat.
>
>Politiker wachsen in Ausnahmelagen, oder sie schrumpfen. Melanie Huml, 44, CSU, schrumpft. Bei ihren öffentlichen Auftritten fehlt ihr in diesen Wochen die Eindringlichkeit und Klarheit, die den Ministerpräsidenten auszeichnet; das fällt umso mehr auf, weil der im Krisenmodus bebende Söder bei Pressekonferenzen oft direkt neben ihr steht. Nun macht der Ärztin Huml bei der Virusbekämpfung fachlich gewiss niemand etwas vor, allerdings soll auch ihr internes Management unter einem niedrigen Energielevel leiden. Bei der Beschaffung von Schutzmasken etwa habe Huml den Nachdruck vermissen lassen, den nicht nur Söder jetzt erwarte, berichtet ein Kabinettsmitglied. Bei Sitzungen gerate die Oberfränkin deshalb regelmäßig in eine reine Verteidigungshaltung.

2020-03-29,jberm123,wallstreetbets,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fps6q5/core_inflation_numbers_tomorrow/flti1ud/,"So following up, here's the history:

In October 1973, OPEC started the oil embargo that lasted until December of 1974. Stocks tanked immediately while the cost of living increased (supply shock of oil caused increase price of oil which caused the spike in inflation). Stocks falling meant that investors believed companies would earn less nominal cash EVEN though the nominal value of the dollar was declining. This sort of makes sense.

The cost of oil was increasing for everyone in the US, which would eat into profits of all companies based in the US.

Thus, stock prices fell while inflation increased.

After thinking it through, I think you were right. It doesn't make sense to say that inflation today would necessarily cause stock prices to increase today. A global supply shock caused by the coronavirus could cause shortages of lots of goods the US purchases from abroad, which could therefore increase prices of goods in the US and hurt the bottom line of companies that rely on cheap goods purchased abroad. So, definitely possible I think to see both high inflation + falling stock prices. And you were right."

It *is* entirely possible that they're doing an amazing job of containing this pandemic even though they are under-testing and are taking no overt measures to counter the spread. Effectively, it's possible that there's just some X factor Japan has that is giving them an ace in the hole in return for little to no effort. 

It is *also* possible that you could argue that a country widely seen to be under-testing and under-reporting is also conveniently finding ways to report *other* causes of death other than Coronavirus, especially given their seeming lack of testing done on people who may otherwise present symptoms even while in hospital, and *especially especially* given their multi-multi-billion-yen reason to do everything in their power to not appear like they're going down a bad path. The *massive* spiked in reported cases in the days since the Olympics were officially delayed aren't a tremendously exonerating sign in this regard. 

I'm not saying either theory is necessarily right because they do both have merits, but I definitely don't think you can discredit Theory 2 as often and as easily as people seem to be."

No one is saying ""ignore social distancing"" let's clear that up up front because I think a lot of people want to pretend like that's the case. No one is saying do not be responsible, either. 
What is being said, is that when people panic and cite that the US has the most confirmed COVID cases in the world, that stands to reason. The US is 3 times as large as Italy, has aggressively tested more than the most proactive country on the matter (South Korea), and the Chinese have obscured and lied about the disease for months. That's not even counting the fact that we're not up on antibody testing yet so we don't know just how many people have caught COVID19 and just weathered it out without going to the doctor or showing any symptoms. Further, a major portion of the deaths in Italy (1/3 of total coronavirus deaths) are linked to an elderly population with pre-existing conditions that compounded the matter. Anecdotal, but some physicians have openly stated that if a COVID patient comes in and dies, they list the cause of death as COVID (Meaning a cancer patient with COVID who succumbs to cancer is a COVID death now). Lastly, you mention how COVID is more infectious than the flu. You're correct! However, something can be infectious and minimally impactful (eg: You get it but it doesn't make you sick, you're just an asymptomatic carrier). Over 80% of COVID cases are mild, a small sliver are severe, the rest are asymptomatic or minor. 
It's only ""10-20 times more deadly than the flu"" if you think all of the available testing is 100% relevant and discount the cases that never rose to the level of testing (Or which concluded prior to testing availability). 
It's not a cognitive dissonance, it's acknowledging that there is an at-risk population that needs to be protected (The elderly, compromised immune systems, etc...) but that there's minimal risk to individuals outside of those categories. The power to mitigate that, unfortunately, is compromised by people who were induced into hysteria and panic when the media decided to run with the UK estimate of millions of deaths in the US (Which was revised downwards with the UK estimate going from 500k to sub 20k. Laughably this was based on ""The impact of quarantine"" 2 days in but 14 days of quarantine is required for any appreciable data, so the epidemiologist making the estimate just needs to be honest and say his numbers were wrong at the onset because there was little to no data fidelity generally). 
The fact of the matter is that if you think this through and apply a modicum of scrutiny to the whole thing while being responsible, the reaction to COVID has been disproportionate to the threat of COVID. Shelter in place is precisely cowering in fear for a disease that most people are likely to get and recover from, if they ever show symptoms."

I experienced at least some of the measures that were done to prevent SARS-CoV one time in my trips back in the Philippines and Hong Kong last 2002 or so. Anyways, this is not to mention that they're similarly-named and related virus from SARS-CoV but with a mere [10-20% difference](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7095418/). Perhaps it's just a mutated and an ""upgraded"" gene of SARS-CoV, but please feel free to correct me if this were to be too simplified or so, especially for those who are experienced in virology.

And with that, the virus's name is SARS-CoV-2. It wasn't called that due to that using the name SARS can have ""unintended consequences in terms of creating unnecessary fear for some populations, especially in Asia which was worst affected by the SARS outbreak in 2003"" according to WHO. (https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/technical-guidance/naming-the-coronavirus-disease-(covid-2019)-and-the-virus-that-causes-it) (link was broken because, well of the parentheses as the part of its link.)

Ironically, just look where are we at now. Did it stop anything against the panic, or did it create some unintended Streisand effect and backfire ironically for the WHO? Whatever WHO was doing, it didn't probably stop the discrimination much against the Asians and the Chinese. I think it unironically just made it worse for them.

My understanding is it’s how the deaths are recorded. Germany only record it as a coronavirus death of the primary cause was the virus. In most cases, the actual cause is the pneumonia that the virus causes or the underlying health condition that it triggers. Eg if someone has a heart condition and the virus makes them have a heart attack it’s recorded as being caused by heart attack not coronavirus. Italy on the other hand record absolutely every death as being caused by it if the patient has it (I read somewhere they record every death in a hospital which is treating CV patients as being caused by it but couldn’t find a reputable source).

It’s a real minefield when you think about it - how do you actually report on deaths caused by something when it’s rarely the primary cause? But yeah, don’t get too excited about Germany - I think culturally they’re more likely to stick to the distancing measures but the real difference does seem to be how they record the deaths. With no agreed way to do it, and testing not being carried out in a uniform way between countries, it’s very hard to say which countries are doing better than others"

If you don't, that money sits in company accounts. Or I suppose you could buy more assets like the Flybe planned or something.

If I was a shareholder in march, I would also not invest more money into the business. You don't know how well the airline will do in a Coronavirus world. (My guess would be not very well)

I also wouldn't lend money to the company that matches the government's terms as the interest is so low. I'd rather keep my cash safe in the current economic climate."

2020-03-29,fartsforpresident,canada,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/canada/comments/fq9fb7/canadians_have_more_faith_in_government_to_handle/fltjm4d/,">I'm genuinely curious - what measures would you have liked to see Canada adopt at the border? Given the situation in the US, do you think that shutting down flights from hot zones would have changed much about our current rates of infection?

The U.S shut flights down a few days before we did. There were *weeks* before that where we knew what was coming. So the U.S is a poor comparison. Taiwan on the other hand, a country of 24 million stuck on a densely populated island, has had fewer than 300 cases, had the outbreak almost immediately arrive on their shores and none of the advantages Canada had in terms of time delay, and they managed it very well from the get go. They also shut down flights. 

>Canada diagnosed coronavirus in a traveller from Iran on the same day Iran announced it had cases. Short of closing the borders completely 6 weeks ago (not just from hot zones), I'm not convinced that stronger border measures would have changed much.

The cost of shutting down flights 6 weeks earlier when it has worked for other countries and was likely to happen anyway (which was known at the time) seems like it would have been much less significant. If you're inevitably going to take the same steps later because it's going to become a bigger problem, then you may as well take them early and try and control a smaller problem. By the time someone landed here from Iran with the virus, it was already a multinational outbreak that was swamping health care services in several places. In light of that it was stupid not to take drastic steps you'd be forced to take anyway."

Telling the public masks don't help because they didn't trust people not to deprive medical workers of needed PPE is not going to stop stupid assholes from hoarding them.

Just be honest about why you don't want everyone wearing them, for fuck's sake: it's a very good reason. As much as possible, we have to trust each other right now, and keep information as accurate as possible: that's why the American response has been so dangerous. This kind of thing doesn't help."

San Antonio (1.5 million people)
Boston (700 thousand people)
Atlanta (500 thousand people)

SARS-CoV-2 does not even need that level; [the CDC allows samples to be tested at BSL-2 labs.](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/lab/lab-biosafety-guidelines.html)

This has happened before, HIV, Ebola, Marburg, Nipah, and Hendra viruses are all examples of pathogens that originated in other species and crossed into humans. Both SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV originated from bats, just like SARS-CoV-2 did.

#As a Weapon?
SARS-CoV-2 is a terrible bioweapon if it is one.

*-It is an RNA virus which makes it hard to control.*

*-It cannot be used to target a specific group.*

*-It has a sub 3% fatality rate*

Compare this to a real bio-weapon, Bacillus Anthracis (The cause of Anthrax)

*-Easy to control bacteria, won’t mutate or spread quickly.*

*-Can be used to target specific groups*

*-80% fatality rate if Anthrax is inhaled*

To the trained eye, BS papers are as obvious as a paper claiming 2+2=4.5. Did you know in the original SARS cov, only 2 residues in the RBD changed from the civet version to produce a 20+ fold change in binding affinity. It's not a surprise to me that Sars2, with its greater difference in RBD compared to its closest animal counterpart, would need to evolve its RBD conformation in humans. Especially since coronavirus replicase has proofreading functions and the RBD is by far the most conserved sequence in the genome.

The app is 100% free to use with an optional pro upgrade. We also recently removed all restrictions on the free tier of the app due to the coronavirus situation. 

Our app is mainly built on open source technologies, and we do hope to bring some parts of taskade to the open source communities in the future.

**Our main tech stack is**

   - Back End: NodeJS, Postgres, Redis, Elastic, Socket.IO. 
   - Front End: ReactJS, GraphQL. 
   - DevOps: Kubernetes. 
   - Cloud: AWS, GCP. 
   - Mobile: iOS, Android, React-Native. 
   - Desktop: ElectronJS.

The project's main focus is to help remote and distributed teams get things done, in a unified workspace. You can manage tasks, write product specs, and video chat with your team, all on the same page.

Our editor (document projects) is like an outlining tool, but more visual, and due dates / project driven. With one project (same data), you can transform and visualize it in multiple views, and collaborate in real-time using:

-   task list view

-   mind map view

-   kanban board view

-   action sheet view

-   org chart view

Try opening <https://www.taskade.com/v/B1Q8lMxIfG> on your browser and toggle the views at the top right corner to see a live demo.

You can also create a task list or mind map without an account here: <https://www.taskade.com/new> --- start typing to give it a try

Lastly you can browse many use cases of Taskade here: <https://www.taskade.com/templates/>

Here is our welcome video: <https://www.taskade.com/welcome-video/>

If you have other suggestions or feedback, please feel free to contact me personally at <john@taskade.com> or here. We are also on [r/Taskade](https://www.reddit.com/r/Taskade/).

> **From the very beginning of the coronavirus's entry into Denmark, the government and its own health authorities have had very different approaches to how the virus should be handled.**

> It tells a number of anonymous sources to the Jutland Post.

> In recent days, several disagreements between the government and the health authorities have seen the light of day.

> Among other things, in relation to a more comprehensive testing strategy and the government's refusal to help more test kits from South Korea.

> But already at a security meeting on Thursday 27 February - the day when Denmark registered the first case of coronavirus - major disagreements occurred, writes Jyllands-Posten.

> According to the sources, Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen (S) was skeptical of whether the health authorities were working hard enough.

> On the part of the Prime Minister, there had been suggestions that people should be imprisoned and man-hunted for returning infected carriers from, for example, ski areas in Italy and Austria with guards.

> The health authorities called for calm and did not see much realism like that.

> In addition to the Prime Minister, Heads of Department and Ministers, among others, was the Director of the Danish Serum Institute Kåre Mølbak and the Director of the National Board of Health, Søren Brostrøm.

> According to the Jyllands-Posten sources, the health authorities stated that more systematic testing and isolation were hasty initiatives that could cause unnecessary panic.

> Another thing that was addressed at the meeting was the unclear communication to citizens.

> At a press conference on February 27, when Health Minister Magnus Heunicke (S) and Kåre Mølbak commented on the first corona case, Mølbak said he would be careful about planning air travel and summer holidays.

> It was not reconciled in advance and was dangerous for the sensitive travel industry, the government believed.

> According to Michael Bang Petersen, Professor of Social Sciences at Aarhus University and expert in crisis management, it is dangerous when communication thus fails.

> It is not possible, because the politicians will need the confidence when we come later in the process where the coronavirus peaks, and we will be even more challenged as a society, he says to the Jutland Post.

> Neither the National Board of Health, the Norwegian Serum Institute nor Magnus Heunicke have wanted to comment on the progress to the newspaper.

2020-03-29,BaunDorn,options,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/options/comments/fqgh6p/option_payoff_calculator/flsyxa5/,"I think fund rebalancing will continue on 30th and 31st to close the month/quarter. Probably an additional $300B or so rotation into equities. It's tough to gage this because I'm sure a lot of rebalancing occurred last week, but it's definitely not over. Some funds may rebalance a bit later on April 1st, we don't really know all of their timelines. JPM is tracking this and initially said fund rebalancing was on the order of $850B for March and as of Friday is about 40%-45% complete.

So our relief rally might extend through Tuesday with some volatility and perhaps peak at SPY 270 where the option market is priced on the upside. There's some minimal bets on 290 and 300 because if 270 breaks there's not much in the way to 300 from a technical perspective. On the flip side, as we hit 255-260 last week massive put positions were opened in the 200-220 range, and I even witness accumulation at 190 for the first time. Some of this is hedging I'm sure, but there are transactions which are very clearly bearish.

As the buying pressure lets off by Apr 1, we'll get the next week of Jobless claims on April 2 and unemployment data on April 3rd. We may or may not sell off in advance of these events on April 1st, but regardless I'm very confident that Apr 1-3 will be net negative and likely begin the trend toward a retest. As we continue in April the Coronavirus will continue to ravage and spread across the US where we start seeing most hospitals in several major US cities overwhelmed and infection/death statistics hit some new highs. In two weeks from now, call it Apr 11, we'll likely see 2,000 deaths per day and over 4m infections (total count, including millions not tested). It's difficult for people to comprehend the exponential function of the virus spread but the growth rate in US is about 1.25 and Trump has no plans to institute a nationa-wide lockdown for 6-10 weeks so the virus will flourish (all countries to halt the spread initated nation-wide lockdowns).

Overall I think we re-test in April, but playing April puts is still quite risky and very expensive so I take a pass on that. I've been building put positions for 5/15 in the range of 200-230. This is conservative enough for me. I considered June with lower IV, but if my research points to something happening in mid April so paying up for June didn't make sense. I also think markets tend to react *before* something happens so I think May gives enough time. If SPY rose to 270 and VIX fell to say 50-53 then I would certainly jump on some June puts, perhaps even 230P or 240P; but this is low odds.

I play this directionally and I'm long puts and long equity, but net short. I keep my option strategies fairly simple and focus more on the research side. I think a bear put spread is good idea for a short position. There's a pretty massive put spread opened March 20 around 11:10am for 80k contracts. Sell Buy 4/17 235P, Sell 4/17 210P. You could probably play something similar but maybe a bit more conservative like May 230P and 210P. I'm not sure of your risk tolerance- it's up to you."

It said that Thackeray held discussions with senior officials who are in charge of special control room for coronavirus set up at the Mantralaya or the state secretariat about how to ensure smooth supply of essential goods earlier in the day. With 5 deaths and 125 coronavirus cases, Maharashtra is, highest in the country in COVID-19 outbreak. 
 
In Tamil Nadu, nine different committees have been formed with senior IAS officers to address concerns over the movement and availability of essential goods to all during the curfew period. A decision on this has arrived after a marathon review meeting held by the state Chief Minister Edappadi Palaniswamy with district collectors and superintendents of police via video-conferencing. Later, the administration issued a statement in Chennai saying, in all district headquarters, a help centre would be established to ensure the movement of essential goods to all places. Section 144, initially promulgated till the end of this month is being extended up to 14th April when the curfew ends.
Private lenders have been directed not to insist on payment of interest and principal for the loans they have given to the poor until further orders due to their job loss. The lenders have been warned of dire consequences if they violate the directive.
District officials have been asked to give identity cards to people other than government servants who are involved in the movement of essential goods.
Besides e-commerce agencies, small retail outlets are also allowed to make door delivery of dry groceries and vegetables.
The list of about 54-thousand people who came from abroad recently has been shared with all district collectors. They have been asked to ensure their proper quarantine.

Isolation wards, step-down wards and medical and paramedical teams are put in place. In Chennai alone, there are over 20-thousand homes that are declared quarantined. However, the city Corporation Commissioner has appealed to public that they should not be considered as people with patients. He has clarified that the action is only a precautionary measure. He has appealed to the public having vacant homes or lodges to give them temporarily to the civic body to augment the isolation and quarantine facilities in the city. Meanwhile, a third private diagnostic centre has been approved by the Indian Council for Medical Research in Chennai.

In order to facilitate people for their daily needs curfew has been relaxed from 7:00 am to 1:00 pm daily across the state. The relaxation in curfew is only to facilitate people to buy their essential commodities not for commuting from one place to another un-necessarily. Only one family member has been allowed to go out for purchasing during the relaxation period. Chief MinisterJairam Thakur directed the District Commissioners’ to explore the possibility of home delivery through major departmental stores of urban areas which would be helpful in observing social distancing. Jairam Thakur also urged the people of the State to buy essential commodities from groceries nearer to their homes as it would be helpful in breaking the COVID-19 chain. 
Meghalaya Chief Minister Conrad K Sangma has said that there is no reason for panic buying as supply of essential commodities will be made available across the State during lockdown period. The statement comes after certain parts of the State witnessed panic buying when some relaxation was given for public to buy essential food items.
Chief Minister's Office said that purpose of social distancing and lockdown will be defeated if people do not follow the directives of the Government and District Administration, who have been working tirelessly to ensure that essential items and services of the Government is made available to the people.
The Chief Minister informed that essential food items will be made available to the public by the administration in different localities."

2020-03-29,Windrunnin,worldnews,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/fqbdup/wuhan_endless_queues_for_ashes_of_coronavirus/flsz1ur/,"I mean, I did suggest that that one was ridiculous.

I guess I have not seen, from any source, the actual guidelines under which someone can be considered to have died from Coronavirus, vs. something else. 

In Spain for example, there was an assisted living/care home that had a number of positive cases spread rapidly, and the carers effectively left and refused to come to work, leading to the elderly population of the home dying without the needed care. 

Many of those people certainly had coronavirus at that point. But was their cause of death coronavirus, or neglect, or not getting the medicine needed for their pre-existing conditions. 

My point is that there IS quite a bit of nuance to how you assign cause of death, and that nuance can vary WIDELY between countries. I simply haven't been able to get a firm set of the guidelines being used in Germany. The two articles you link too are single line summaries, which contradict each other. 

I don't have anything going the other way, or any evidence myself, of course, but given that Germany seems to be having a statistically low number of Coronavirus deaths, how they attribute cause of death is definitely something interesting that should be examined, if only to rule it out, before exaimining if there's something else in Germany's treatment methods that is working well."

I explained to him that I think this is hurtful, racist, and wrong; and that as people of color (we're are both POC, though he is white-appearing), we should feel united in uplifting every minority group

Couple of things about this:

- Outside of context, calling SARS-CoV-2 the Chinese virus is accurate to describe its origin. *In context*, the name is unfortunately often used to justify racism against Chinese people outside of China.

- While it is noble to have the sentiment that POC should be united in lifting up other POC, this is not shared by ethnic Chinese in China (who are not a minority there): many are buying into the CCP narrative that this virus was intentionally planted by the US, and blaming America (which of course includes Americans of color).

Ultimately, I'd focus on trying to make him understand how you feel about his behaviour and not by appealing to the feelings of another group who may not return the favor."

This is something that happens for every birth. The mother always passes her antibodies for most of the pathogens she's been exposed to in her life to the child but this virus is brand new.

But even our nice western EU civilized countries can end up with rioting Faster Than Expected[tm] if food supplies run out, or if a large % of the populace can't access food. 

>But I am looking at the infection numbers and mortality for this and they tell me that A) this is going to be over in 6-9 months because by that time everybody will have been infected and B) the mortality rate is sufficiently low that society will not break down completely. And I don't see German society collapsing on that timeframe.

Let's hope you are right, this is one possible scenario but only one. Check out my [worst case scenaio](https://old.reddit.com/r/collapse/comments/fnjpez/the_worstcase_scenario_for_covid19_it_can_and/fld0kgi/) *while noting that I don't think the worst case is at all likely* but that I do think that very bad case outcomes are possible. You seem to just be a lot more optomistic than I am. I've become a total pessimist after watching humans behave stupidly for decades. Getting old does that to a person I guess.   

>What might happen is some level of racial tension/unrest. The problem is that, usually, panic and stupid behavior is more prevalent in less educated parts of the population. And if you look at the levels of education you have the lowest levels of education in certain migration groups and the recent refugees. So, if any rioting occurs, I would suspect them to do it. And then the government would be in a bind. Either be called racist by visibly cracking down on big protests of brown people or accept that things go south real bad and (potentially) risk huge counterprotests and violence. Something similar is currently already happening with the ""clans"", Turkish and Arab crime families that are driving a lot of organized crime in metropolitan areas.

Agreed, but you are leaving out the white supremecists that might go into the streets to fight. I've seen rumblings from the neonazi movement about how they might use this situation to their advantage. I guess I don't need to remind you that this is a big problem in Germany. So what you have there are a bunch of under educated, under priveleged, not very well integrated immigratns who are NOT blameless angels (some of them do shit like this some times https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2015%E2%80%9316_New_Year%27s_Eve_sexual_assaults_in_Germany ) and a bunch of white supremecists who want any excuse to tangle with said non-angelic immigrants. That seems like quite a powder keg to me. Will it go off? Dunno. How well will those immigrants be taken care of? Dunno. That'll determine in large part how they will behave. 

I actually listen to a podcast called Coronavirus Central hosted by a (maybe former?) white supremacist from the US, and even that guy is saying ""HOLY FUCK YOU NEED TO GIVE MONEY TO THE ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS OR THINGS WILL GO BADLY"". I would expect Mutti to do this, but who knows how that will go. She did once tell a crying immigrant girl to fuck off back home lol so it's a bit anyone's guess.

I do think that once you scratch the surface of almsot any society you'll see embers of potential riots that may burst into flames when things start going sideways. Ofc you are correct, every society is a bit different, and some will have fewer embers than others. But never say never. The human virus is idiotic and violent and prone to doing stupid shit like rioting during a pandemic, just slightly differently so depending on how well it's being placated."

**Why Coronavirus COVID19 is fatal in some people more than others – and who are those most at risk?**


Type-2 Diabetes is a condition of hyperinsulinaemia (high blood glucose levels with chronically elevated insulin), high blood pressure (symptom of hyperinsulinaemia) which occurs in those with diabetes (pre diabetes – aka stage 1 Type-2 diabetes), these are MAJOR RISK factors for complication and fatality from Coronavirus COVID19.


How is blood glucose (sugar) and hyperinsulinaemia related to Coronavirus?
 

Emerging research and statistics indicate that people with diabetes, high blood glucose (hyperinsulinaemia) have a 10 times (10X) greater likelihood of fatality than people without pre-existing conditions (co-morbidity).


According to the CDC, people without a pre-existing condition have a 0.9% fatality rate, as opposed to a 10.5% (10 times more!) fatality in those with hyperinsulinaemia (Type-2 diabetes/hypertension/CVD/metabolic syndrome).

Many people do not realise they already have Stage 1 Type-2 diabetes. How can you tell if you do?

-   Having a BMI over 22 (not “below 24.9” – unless you have less than 20% fat mass, where a higher BMI is due to high muscle content). Calculate this by dividing your weight in kilograms by your squared height in metres (kg/(metres^2))
-   Having a “muffin top” above your jeans
-   Acid reflux/heart burn (early sign of hyperinsulinaemia)
-   Frequent eructation (burping, and delayed burping). (Early sign of hyperinsulinaemia)
-   Frequent hiccups (this is a sign of low stomach acidity which is a very early sign of hyperinsulinaemia)
-   High blood glucose throughout the day
-   Sustained high blood glucose 3 hours after a meal
-   High triglycerides/Low HDL (see this in your blood tests from doctors)
-   No ketones on a ketone meter constantly through the day
-   High blood pressure

  

If you do not know you have hidden hyperinsulinaemia and would like to know, buy a ketone and glucose meter, this is a good home “do it yourself” way to know if you suffer hidden hyperinsulinaemia.

  

  

Far too many people do not take diabetes, metabolic syndrome, hyperinsulinaemia seriously. Most think it is fine to medicate the symptoms, such as taking exogenous insulin to manage uncontrolled elevated blood glucose (sugar), or taking medications to stimulate more insulin secretion (endogenous) from your own pancreas. They approach diabetes with resignation, as something that is chronic and progressive (because many MD doctors have told them that), and have been told that they can manage it with medications. However, they have not been told that these medications that only manage symptoms also make the disease worse, and the condition as well as medication itself, causes major health complications (morbidity), and earlier death from all causes (Crofts  _et al.,_ 2015).

  

  

Why is Type-2 diabetes (hyperinsulinaemia – chronically elevated insulin levels) so dangerous? Because it wreaks havoc on every system and organ in the body. Hyperglycaemia and hyperinsulinaemia suppresses and dysregulates the immune function (Khan  _et al.,_  2016), allowing Coronavirus COVID19 to overwhelm the system and become fatal

Primary reasons why people with diabetes (hyperglycaemia with hyperinsulinaemia) (metabolic syndrome/hyperinsulinaemia) are at greater risk of death from Coronavirus COVID19:

  

1.  Chronically elevated, or chronic extreme fluctuations in blood glucose causes stress in the body and suppresses immune function. Test your blood glucose before a meal, if it is 108mg/dL (6mmol/L – which is already stage 1 diabetes, if this number is a constant regular test result), and then after that meal your glucose spikes to over 200mg/dL (11.1mmol/L), this is a sign that you have type 2 diabetes (hyperinsulinaemia). If your blood glucose is 90mg/dL (5mmol/L) one day, and over 150mg/dL (8.3mmol/L) the next, this is sign of a problem. This is destroying your ability to fight infections. People with Type-2 diabetes (hyperinsulinaemia) suffer from infections (and respiratory infections), much more severely and with greater frequency.
    

  

  

2.  High blood glucose (hyperglycaemia) creates a dangerous inflammatory environment in the body. Coronavirus COVID19 is much more virulent in a high glucose environment. Hyperglycaemia inactivates macrophages (immune cells), weakening your immune response (Khan  _et al.,_  2016). Hyperinsulinaemia causes your immune cells, muscle and fat cells to excessively secrete inflammatory cytokines (Fishel  _et al.,_  2005, Lee  _et al.,_  2017, Rufino  _et al.,_  2017). The combination can be overwhelming and fatal.
    

  

  

3.  Type-2 Diabetes, Pre-Diabetes (Stage 1 Type-2 Diabetes), cardiovascular disease, hypertension and metabolic syndrome are inflammatory conditions where there is chronically too much insulin in the blood – this is hyperinsulinaemia (Crofts  _et al.,_  2015). Conventional websites like the NHS, WHO, Mayo Clinic will describe Type-2 Diabetes as having uncontrolled high blood glucose and then say it is a condition where the insulin is not able to do its job, or say the individual is “insulin resistant” and then lead you to think you just need more insulin (more force to get the glucose down). This is NOT the case.
    

Yes, Type-2 Diabetes is uncontrolled chronically elevated glucose levels, and yes this is because some cells in your body have become insulin resistant (muscle cells and for Alzheimer’s it is the brain neurons), but the cells became insulin resistant due to chronically elevated insulin! Insulin secretion is stimulated by elevated blood sugar, glucose. How does your blood glucose get elevated? – the PRIMARY cause is from certain carbohydrate food! Starchy farinaceous carbohydrates, as well as high glycaemic load foods which includes; fruit, honey, “natural sugars”, rice, wheat, wholegrains, carrots, peas, quinoa, lentils, chickpeas, dried fruits, certain nuts that are high in carbs, sweet corn, potatoes, pumpkin, sweet potatoes, coconut flour nectar, sugar in all its forms! Consumed above a personal carbohydrate tolerance threshold regularly, contribute to causing systemic inflammation in your body because insulin stimulates inflammatory pathways (chemical signalling switches) inside of your cells and outside of your cells (Hansen  _et al.,_  2014). Insulin activates the production of cytokines via activating intracellular inflammasome (a protein complex that mediates signals to turn on inflammation activity and production of inflammatory molecules like TNF-alpha, cytokines such as interleukin 1-beta, interleukin 6, Nf-KB and many more) (Perkins  _et al.,_  2015). Coronavirus COVID19 causes cytokine storms in at risk people, overwhelming them and resulting in the fatalities we are seeing. The people who are suffering the worst cases and dying are those who already have elevated inflammatory cytokines, a massive contributory cause of this, is by hyperinsulinemia which may present as Type-2 diabetes, Alzheimer's or Parkinson's Disease, cardiovascular disease (CVD), hypertension, overweight or auto-immune conditions (Crofts  _et al.,_  2015).

  

  

Chronic systemic inflammation predisposes individuals to complications from infection. Coronavirus COVID19 kills by causing a cytokine storm, an uncontrolled over-reaction of the immune system (which normally produces cytokines to fight infections, but can normally switch it off too, however when people have hyperinsulinaemia, their immune system cannot switch off the cytokine storm, because all their other cells are also chronically releasing cytokines- muscle cells and fat cells in particular). The “switch off self-regulation system is impaired and

overridden by hyperinsulinaemia. The immune system is no longer able to self-regulate (adaptive homeostasis), leading to severe pulmonary inflammation (in the lungs), resulting in blocked airways causing acute respiratory syndrome and failure.

  

  

Reducing this inflammation is possible. This is achievable by no longer eating foods that increase blood glucose and resultant stimulation of insulin secretion (instead of using medication such as exogenous insulin to lower blood glucose). Making this change can make all the difference in survival from this viral infection."

Although the Feira hospital had no pediatric intensive care, and the cases were usually referred to Santo António, in Oporto, the medical team decided that the patient was at greater risk if transferred. The boy suffered from psoriasis, a disease which can weaken the immune system, according to a clinical source heard by JN.

> The prevalence of metabolic health in American adults is 'alarmingly low,' even among people who are normal weight, according to a new study. Only one in eight Americans is achieving optimal metabolic health. This carries serious implications for public health since poor metabolic health leaves people more vulnerable to developing Type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease and other serious health issues.

High blood sugar can be fixed in days with the right diet and lifestyle. T2 diabetes within weeks. 

effect of an intervention can be quite easily measured. CGM would be ideal but the regular much cheaper blood glucose monitor also works fine. 

Risks are low, probability of having some covid-related benefit seems atleats moderate (IMO). Its likely to have non-covid related side benefits.

No where in the study does it say that the  COVID-19 causing coronavirus was spreading to humans for decades. This is 100% made up by SCMP for propaganda purposes. In fact the study continues to imply that the Wuhan wet market continues to be the likely origin of the coronavirus which causes COVID-19. But it’s inconclusive on whether or not the virus mutated the ability to infect other humans before or after a cross species infection.  
 
The study also concludes that it is extremely unlikely that the coronavirus was made in a laboratory. No where does it state that the coronavirus we are dealing with now that causes covid-19 was secretly infecting people for decades! That is just desperate propaganda to deflect blame from the CCP.
 
Remember that SCMP is owned by Alibaba and Alibaba’s founder is a member of the Chinese Communist Party."

A hearing had been set for Friday, according to the court docket, but it was unclear if it would go forward.

One of Fernández’s Rundle’s top prosecutors late Tuesday acknowledged that the day’s court hearings “did not go as planned” and “many of the calendars were inundated with release motions, many of which were inappropriate.”

“Everyone is frustrated with the result and \[Chief Judge Soto\] has directed that going forward, the judges will be asking the public defenders to pick their top 20 cases to place on the calendar,” Chief Assistant State Attorney Don Horn wrote in an email obtained by the Herald.

So it's really hard to compare. Also your personality and how you cope with pain will influence your ability to work /   be active. Then you have the medications and if they work...  
If SSDI is better for you financially then a part time gig it's worth to think about. But working part time also get's you to take your mind off of it, have social contacts and something 'normal' to do that others do as well.   
If you quit your job there is a possibility that the more you are at home, it get's depressing over time and there is a certain loneliness to it... 

Have you ever gone to to therapy or chronic pain rehabilitation? (Sorry not a native speaker, so I'm not really sure of this is the correct term). There you focus on the physical and emotional aspect of having a (invisible) chronic illness, how it translates to your personality and how you can respond to that. You work on the accepting part and how you can integrate it in your life. Learning what is important for you. Learn your boundaries regarding work and hours and your physical strength and how to improve it gradually to find out what you can do on a good day and on a bad day.   
It helped me a lot regarding finding my own physical balance, making decisions regarding the future, communicating with my social support and my doctors and accepting my limitations. And grieving about the loss of a part of my personality and how to cope with that it also a big part of the process.  
If you decide to go on SSDI I would advise you to look if there's a program you could enroll in that offers this. The one that I went into was 3 afternoons a week, it helped having a schedule.   
Due to the coronavirus everywhere it's probably hard now. You could also look into the ACT method (accepting and commitment therapy), they provide courses online or you can try to find a psychologist that will work on an online programma with you which you can consult by phone as well.

It's not about what most people can do with AS, it's about what you can do while living with it. If one of the biologicals would have worked, your life would be different to.  
If SSDI is needed to get you forward then do, but please keep in mind that being at home all the time is also not great for your (mental & physical) health, so consider that as well... And sometimes you just need to take a break to see what's going on, and that's also fine.  
Find out where you are...  


If you have any questions I don't mind to answer, send me a message.  
I wish you good luck and a lot of strength while making your decisions, these are the hard ones..."

Es gibt Berichte in denen vermutet wird, dass es mehr Coronatote gibt als in der Statistik steht, weil die Toten nicht alle auf Corona getestet werden. (Was auch sinnvoll ist! Ein Toter steckt niemanden mehr an, ein Lebender aber schon. Wenn man nicht alle testen kann, dann ist es besser die Lebenden zu testen. Weniger Tote ist mehr wert als eine akkurate Statistik.) Ärzte werden aber vermutlich sehr viel mehr getestet. Es gibt also wahrscheinlich kaum tote Ärzte die an Corona gestorben sind aber bei denen das nicht festgestellt wird. Es ist also möglich, dass die reale Todesrate gleich ist und die Ärztestatistik nur viel akkurater ist als die für die allgemeine Bevölkerung.

Die Ärzte in den Krankenhäuser schieben gerade Überstunden ohne Ende. Das erschöpft. Es ist möglich, dass die Krankheit schlimmer bei einer überarbeiteten und erschöpften Person verläuft, als bei einer die das Bett hütet.

Eine weitere mögliche Erklärung könnte in Virusmutationen liegen. In der Island Teststudie neulich kam raus, dass es viele Mutationen des Virus gibt. Eine Möglichkeit warum Ärzte eine höhere Sterblichkeit zu haben scheinen (was nicht sicher ist, siehe vorherigen Paragraph), könnte sein, dass sie sich mit mehreren Virusmutationen gleichzeitig anstecken.

Linear growth is progress towards slowing growth and eventually zero growth.  But this isn’t reason to get stoked yet - a couple days’ data is not enough to know if that’s even happening at all.

Across the basketball courts of New York, there aren’t many degrees of separation.

It did not take the coronavirus to know this. But the pandemic has reinforced it — fatally.

David Cain, who grew up in Harlem and played basketball for St. John’s in the early 1990s, had a birthday coming, his 49th. He spread word that there would be a party on March 14 at Mom’s Cigar & Lounge Warehouse in Scarsdale, a suburb north of the city.

Lee Green, 49, a former St. John’s teammate from the Bronx, would serve as the D.J. Dozens of men, mostly in their 40s, most connected to the web of New York City basketball, would come. They found wipes at the door, then relaxed in the leather chairs, shared drinks and food, and soaked in the smoke and camaraderie.

“It was a great, great night,” Cain said. “A beautiful night.”

Ten days later, two of the men were dead after testing positive for coronavirus — Green and Jonathan Duck, 50, a big man from the Bronx who played at Iona. He and Cain were AAU teammates and high school rivals"

Stop everything, get everyone quarantined, stop flights, close shop, etc... you keep people healthy but you'll go bankrupt.

And no point in having money and living comfortably if, well, if you get Coronavirus and die earlir than expected. plus people really don't think about the long-term consequences util these consequences finally reach them and hit them in the face.

Also, just for the record: In my opinion, no matter how every government say they could deal with the money issues if they go into full quarantine locking people home... No government could deal with a complete economical crash like...idk, if 90% of it's population stopping work entirely. I'm still waiting to see what they'll do in my country.

According to Pairi Daiza, there are currently between 115,000 and 130,000 hippos living in the wild in Africa.
Considered a 'vulnerable species' by the International Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources (IUCN), hippopotamuses can be found in the wild from Mali to South Africa but became extinct in a number of countries such as Algeria, Egypt and Eritrea.
According to the IUCN, the main threat against the species are the destruction of its habitat, hunting, armed conflicts, water management and droughts."

There's a lot of conflicting info in your comment. Italy got messed up so bad because of workers fleeing cities to their villages.

Regarding US, even if people wanted to migrate en masse, it would still be relatively safer since their public transport infrastructure is almost non existent and most of them use personal cars. In India, it's a completely different situation where majority of them rely on trains and other ""public"" modes. Nevertheless, even US is in a very bad situation now.

>Italy bungled at the start but recovered admirably.

The 10,000+ deaths say otherwise. They had close to 1000 deaths just yesterday. What recovery are you talking about?

SK is so much ahead in tech., research & infrastructure compared to India. Why would you compare the two given the current situation?

**You aren't considering many limiting factors about a huge & homogeneous nation like India and its massive population compared to the other 1st world countries, tech & medical infrastructure, budget, public literacy, mindset and culture, etc.**

It's easy to write ""I want everything to go smoothly and planned"" on a piece of paper. But it takes a herculean effort to bring things under control here. India's learning and adapting. Sure, some measures have been inadequate or improper, but that doesn't mean they haven't done anything.

These are unprecedented times. No amount of ""planning"" for such a huge country will prevent damage. We can only mitigate the spread considering the various factors.

If you want to argue for the sake of arguing while conveniently ignoring facts and pushing selective information, I'm not going to engage in this debate further. I'm no fan of the govt., but it's very evident that you're arguing with a huge bias.

> First: “transparency is the best policy”. Although nothing was known about the SARS coronavirus at the time when the disease first struck, we soon realized that, as Doberstyn points out, “some of the affected countries did not acknowledge openly and squarely the presence of SARS, downplayed its extent, and attempted to prove that it was something else.” Perhaps, if there had been prompt and accurate reporting of the full facts so that others could have been forewarned and taken preventive measures, history may have taken a different course...

>Second: “twenty-first century science played a relatively small role in controlling SARS; nineteenth-century techniques continued to prove their value”. We can not deny the general truth that we still continue to battle twenty-first century scourges with a nineteenth century toolbox supplemented by a few modern scientific advances...

>Third: “animal husbandry and marketing practices seriously affect human health”. Since its discovery in 2003, the SARS coronavirus has been thought to have originated in animals. One of the chapters of the book attempts to elucidate the evidence for this...

Back to your question. The answer is an obvious no. Did I even say anything about causing the COVID-19 outbreak here? It's about the unintended discrimination.

Everyone here talking about them not having classified it as a pandemic funny understand the issues that this classification brings, nor the necessary conditions to be met.

The WHO guidelines for defining a pandemic, actually include issues like severity, which goes against the classical definition.  But it also allows for them to not have to deal with typical seasonal viral threats, I mean, technically the seasonal flu is a pandemic but it lacks any real severity that calling it a pandemic might consider.  The attempt add I understand it, is to only use the term in conditions where significant international coordination becomes necessary.  Vox has a decent write up [here](https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2020/3/9/21163412/who-coronavirus-covid19-pandemic-world-health-organization), the WHO bulletin from [2011](https://www.who.int/bulletin/volumes/89/7/11-088815/en/)  is pretty decent as well and contains a number of sources on the arguments contained."

| [**Is the source of the coronavirus causing COVID-19 known?**](https://www.who.int/news-room/q-a-detail/q-a-coronaviruses#) Currently, the source of SARS-CoV-2, the coronavirus (CoV) causing COVID-19 is unknown. All available evidence suggests that SARS-CoV-2 has a natural animal origin and is not a constructed virus. SARS-CoV-2 virus most probably has its ecological reservoir in bats. SARS-CoV-2, belongs to a group of genetically related viruses, which also include SARS-CoV and a number of other CoVs isolated from bats populations. MERS-CoV also belongs to this group, but is less closely related. |В настоящее время источник SARS-CoV-2, коронавируса (CoV), вызывающего COVID-19, неизвестен. Все имеющиеся данные свидетельствуют о том, что SARS-CoV-2 имеет естественное животное происхождение и не является сконструированным вирусом. Вирус SARS-CoV-2 наиболее вероятно имеет свой экологический резервуар у летучих мышей. SARS-CoV-2 относится к группе генетически связанных вирусов, которые также включают SARS-CoV и ряд других CoV, выделенных из популяций летучих мышей. MERS-CoV также принадлежит к этой группе, но менее тесно связана.  |
| [**How did the first human SARS-CoV-2 infections occur?**](https://www.who.int/news-room/q-a-detail/q-a-coronaviruses#) The first human cases of COVID-19 were identified in Wuhan City, China in December 2019. At this stage, it is not possible to determine precisely how humans in China were initially infected with SARS-CoV-2. However, SARS-CoV, the virus which caused the SARS outbreak in 2003, jumped from an animal reservoir (civet cats, a farmed wild animal) to humans and then spread between humans. In a similar way, it is thought that SARS-CoV-2 jumped the species barrier and initially infected humans, but more likely through an intermediate host, that is another animal species more likely to be handled by humans - this could be a domestic animal, a wild animal, or a domesticated wild animal and, as of yet, has not been identified. Until the source of this virus is identified and controlled, there is a risk of reintroduction of the virus in the human population and the risk of new outbreaks like the ones we are currently experiencing.| Как появились первые человеческие инфекции SARS-CoV-2? Первые случаи заболевания людей COVID-19 были выявлены в городе Ухань, Китай, в декабре 2019 года. На данном этапе невозможно точно определить, каким образом люди в Китае были изначально заражены SARS-CoV-2.  Тем не менее, SARS-CoV, вирус, который вызвал вспышку SARS в 2003 году, выскочил из резервуара с животными (циветы, выращиваемые на диких животных) в организм человека и затем распространился между людьми. Аналогичным образом, считается, что SARS-CoV-2 преодолел видовой барьер и первоначально инфицировал людей, но, скорее всего, через промежуточного хозяина, то есть другого вида животных, с которым люди, скорее всего, будут обращаться - это может быть домашнее животное дикого животного или одомашненного дикого животного, и до сих пор не было идентифицировано.  Пока источник этого вируса не будет идентифицирован и не будет проверен, существует риск повторного введения вируса в человеческую популяцию и риск новых вспышек, подобных тем, которые мы наблюдаем в настоящее время. |

*Я понимаю, что адептам закулисных закулис, информаци от ВОЗ воспринимается с точностью до наоборот, но мне она кажется куда более как достоверной, чем заявления от ГРУшника-экономиста-эпидемиолога-эксперта по террактам на самолетах исчезнувших в Антлантическом океане.*"

>Health care, along with safe living and working conditions, is central to Oberlin’s UAW solidarity organizing. It would be unconscionable for Oberlin to fire or otherwise cut the health care of the targeted workers during a global pandemic, especially as it relies on those same workers to potentially expose themselves to the virus by cleaning rooms left behind by departed students. To date, the administration has not made any comments on employee health care in light of the coronavirus.

>But the administration seems to be specifically targeting union health care. The $2 million that Oberlin expects to save annually through outsourcing approximately coincides with the compiled benefits packages of the 108 UAW workers. By outsourcing, Oberlin can avoid any obligation to provide health care and other benefits to those who work on its campus.

>With the onset of coronavirus, the costs of cutting staff health care and paid time off are acute. Not only does paid time off and health care ensure that the disease is less likely to be transmitted — resulting in better health outcomes for everyone — but it also protects and values those workers who will be among the first exposed in any outbreak. How can Oberlin continue to portray itself as a progressive institution if its labor practices hurt both its employees and the surrounding community? How can Oberlin ask its unionized staff to protect and care for its students when it refuses to offer them the same respect?"

2020-03-29,Vicfendan,mexico,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/mexico/comments/fq7n0j/pregunta_seria_hay_alguna_persona_aquí_qué_haya/fltn7v8/,"De acuerdo, siempre se pueden hacer las cosas mejor pero revisemos los puntos que dijiste.

* Nuestros epidemiólogos expertos nos dicen que cerrar fronteras/aereopuertos no está demostrado que funcione, suficiente ver qué en los países que se ha hecho no ha habido un gran cambio en su crecimiento. Sobre el control de vuelos estoy totalmente de acuerdo, de hecho el país más exitoso del que nadie habla, Taiwan, implementó big data de manera que la info de vuelos y migración esta sincronizada con los archivos médicos. Si un paciente llegaba con síntomas el doctor mismo podía ver si el paciente venía de un país con mayor progresión de la epidemia y así les podía mandar una prueba. Esa si es una medida que les ha funcionado y nadie más en el mundo lo hace. Aunque ellos tienen la ventaja de ser un país pequeño con una población igual de pequeña. Tomaron otras medidas de fase 0 y fase 1 que nadie o casi nadie siguió. Al 20 de marzo tenían como 140 casos y eso que están a ciento y pico de kilómetros de la costa de china.

* Se debe mantener un balance entre el impacto económico/social de las medidas y el beneficio que se puede obtener. A cuánta gente le vas a quitar o bajar su ingreso y por cuánto tiempo, si lo haces muy pronto puedes causar inseguridad, valemadrismo, pobreza, psicológico por aquello de estar encerrados más de un mes, y en general un golpe duro a la economía.

* [Dale un vistazo a  esta gráfica.](https://www.google.com/amp/s/politico.mx/minuta-politica/minuta-politica-gobierno-federal/m%25C3%25A9xico-actu%25C3%25B3-r%25C3%25A1pido-vs-coronavirus-no-se-parece-a-italia-o-eua/%3famp=1) se ve en qué parte de la curva los países implementaron distanciamiento social y como México aplicó las medidas antes de que la curva empezará a crecer o llegará a fase 2. Tampoco le creas mucho al primer y segundo párrafo de la nota, pues Gatell lo que dijo es que todavía estabamos a a tiempo en ese momento de frenar el crecimiento exponencial, más no dijo que YA lo habíamos frenado, para que veas que a los periodistas les hace falta escuchar y reportar con certeza se inclinen a favor o en contra del discurso. Hoy aún Gatell informo que la tendencia de crecimiento no había disminuido y es el último momento para acatar las medidas.

* Es algo que no es tan importante cuando lo piensas bien. Checa por favor mi último comentario en el que hago una comparativa entre Italia y Corea, también un vistazo a Japón. Lo que tienen en común los países en los que el crecimiento exponencial se ha desacelerado son las medidas de distanciamiento social. Italia y Corea tienen en común que han hecho muchas pruebas, la diferencia es como actuó la sociedad en cada país. También ponte a pensar que para realizar las pruebas las personas se tienen que mover. Si eres asintomático y estás infectado y vas a hacerte una prueba puedes contagiar a la gente del transporte, de la calle y al personal de salud y lo único que ganaste es un papelito, por eso la indicación es quedarte en casa y distanciado de todos. Se le está diciendo al sector privado que deje ir a sus trabajadores. Por otro lado si estás sano y vas a hacerte una prueba, te expones a pescarlo en la clinica, en el metro, etc. Si estás enfermo y tienes síntomas leves igual puedes contagiar a los demás y no es necesario recibir atención médica, por eso la indicación es que también se queden en casa. 

Y por último, parece que México se rezagó en tomar las medidas de fase 2 porque fueron de los últimos países en la línea del tiempo que las tomaron. Eso fue cuando ya se estaban derrumbando las cosas en Europa y estados unidos iba para arriba. Sin embargo hay que recordar que el primer caso de México se dio un mes después que en estos países, refierete a la imagen de los circulitos otra vez para que veas, eso quiere decir que tuvimos un mes de ventaja para planear el momento exacto para implementar las medidas 

Así que en resumen de todo esté argumento:

* México no le está apostando a la inmunidad de manada como estrategia. 

* Las medidas de fase 2 se han hecho a tiempo, por lo menos antes que otros países.

*Aunque se hayan tomado a tiempo las medidas, el resultado depende de qué la población sea responsable y las acate.

*Tengas o no síntomas mejor hay que quedarse en casa y actuar como si fueras un vector del virus de todas maneras. Solo en caso de tener síntomas como neumonía pedir asistencia. Hay que dejarle las pruebas a quienes lo necesiten. 

*Si se pudieron haber hecho mejores acciones para la fase 0 y 1. Consuelo de tontos es que solo un país que yo sepa ha implementado algo así."

Chinese people point fingers and say that the west is racist, when a hick can say what they want, any Chinese person can still buy property here or go through the dedication to become a citizen. That China is hostile to the west probably got less to do with building walls and more to do with the fact that the West never did anything good to China.

I am glad if you feel safe personally, but I care that Chinese aren't safe. But do you honestly believe that spending this much time defending the change in attitude that many westerns who live in China are feeling after the outbreak of the pandemic, without mentioning one time, the attempt to blame somebody outside China for the novel virus, will make your claims seem real?

firstly psychosomatic symptoms: I see it everywhere people coughing, feeling sick even though they are not infected but becuase they see hysteria everywhere

secondly psychological damage to population induced by hesteria

then we have economic demage weaker economy = people consuming less nutrients = less nutrients = weaker immune system that means more people die from other viruses. this was the reason why spanish flu got out of control btw

lastly zombified population conditioned to be controlled and don't ask questions is the reason why dictatorships came into power. it's simple demand and supply as strong arm politcal decisions became more popular (see macron popularity rise after he implemented measures against coronavirus) so does the authoritarian politicians and when we get to the point where people disappear bc they talked shit about the government"

If your idea of going back to ‘normal’ is getting back to feeling good in the short term while chugging along towards climate change, than I worry about you.

In the case with USA, population size and density again plays a factor, which is why NYC is hit the hardest. In addition, you have higher domestic travel within the USA given the numerous locations. Also, our medical system is far superior than USA's. A month ago, I was reading in the Coronavirus subreddit that USA had done very little testing, inaccurate testing, not enough testing kits, lack of medical facilities to get them ready. I believe Italy's medical system wasn't also top notch either.

So when ScoMo says don't compare Australia with other countries and copy and paste their lockdown plans, he's actually right."

As per John Hopkins University tally this is fewer than the 10,023 in Italy, Spain's 5,812, China's 3,299 or the 2,317 in France.
As on late Saturday, Johns Hopkins recorded 1,21,000 US cases. This included a 23 per cent jump of 21,309 in one day which is also a record.
New York, which is the epicentre of the US outbreak, recorded over 50,000 cases which is about half of the country's total count.
US President Donald Trump on Saturday said he is considering to impose a quarantine on New York in a bid to slow the spread of the Coronavirus. However, New York Governor Andrew Cuomo told reporters he did not think such a move could be legally enforceable.
Meanwhile, globally the death toll has surged past 30,000 of which over 20,000 deaths took place in Europe with Italy (889) and Spain (832) each reporting more than 800 dead in one day.
More than 6.40 lakh cases of the novel Coronavirus have been officially recorded around the world since the outbreak began late last year. Russia which has reported relatively low levels of the virus, said it would close its borders on Sunday."

 Segundo o diretor-executivo do Instituto de Energia e Meio Ambiente (Iema), André Luís Ferreira, uma análise preliminar dos dados da Cetesb (Companhia Ambiental do Estado de São Paulo) já permite apontar que, “a partir do último dia 23, a [poluição do ar](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/equilibrioesaude/2019/06/em-uma-hora-de-transito-em-sp-populacao-fuma-5-cigarros-diz-estudo.shtml) reduziu significativamente em comparação com a semana anterior”.

 “Caíram especialmente as emissões de poluentes como monóxido de carbono e dióxido de nitrogênio. A emissão de material particulado também caiu, embora seja uma queda menor”, diz Ferreira.

  

 Enquanto o monóxido de carbono e o dióxido de nitrogênio são poluentes típicos da queima de combustível do motor do carros, o material particulado é emitido por veículos movidos a diesel, como ônibus e caminhões. Ambos continuam circulando durante a quarentena.

 Por causa disso, os dados em estações de monitoramento com alto tráfego de caminhões, como na marginal Tietê, tiveram uma queda menor na emissão de poluentes, enquanto bairros onde normalmente há mais tráfego de carros tiveram uma “queda muito significativa”, ainda segundo Ferreira.

 A análise quantitativa ainda deve ser apresentada pelo Iema, a partir dos dados das estações de monitoramento da Cetesb. O órgão do governo também está preparando uma análise sobre a poluição no período de quarentena.

  Alguns paulistanos já vinham percebendo e compartilhando nas redes sociais relatos sobre um ar mais limpo e fotos de um céu mais azul. “Essa sensação de que as pessoas têm de que o ar está melhor é verdadeira, o ar melhorou”, afirma Ferreira.

 No entanto, ele ressalva que o céu mais claro resulta da combinação de queda na poluição com outros fatores meteorológicos (como nuvens, ventos e chuvas) e que, portanto, a análise dos dados precisará considerar ainda uma comparação com os dados do ano anterior.

 Além de diminuir a poluição do ar, a queda nas emissões de gases dos veículos automotores também reduz impacto sobre a saúde das pessoas, já que a poluição está ligada a [doenças respiratórias](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/colunas/monicabergamo/2020/03/brasil-tem-explosao-de-internacoes-por-problemas-respiratorios-diz-fiocruz.shtml) e cardiovasculares.

 As taxas de mortalidade decorrentes dessas doenças são maiores em cidades com mais emissão de material particulado, segundo um estudo que analisou dados de 652 cidades em 24 países. Ele foi publicado no último agosto pela revista The New England Journal of Medicine com contribuição de cientistas de vários países, incluindo o médico e professor da USP Paulo Saldiva.

 A restrição da circulação ainda representa diminuição das emissões de gases-estufa na cidade de São Paulo, onde os motores dos veículos movidos a gasolina e diesel são a maior fonte de contribuição para o aquecimento global.

 As medidas de isolamento social para combater o coronavírus também têm derrubado emissões de gases-estufa como o dióxido de nitrogênio na [Itália](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/mercado/2020/03/norte-da-italia-reduz-poluicao-depois-de-isolamento-causado-pelo-coronavirus.shtml) e na [China](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/equilibrioesaude/2020/03/medidas-contra-coronavirus-reduziram-poluicao-e-salvaram-50-mil-na-china-diz-pesquisador.shtml), como consequência da redução do uso dos transportes e da atividade industrial. Ainda não se sabe, no entanto, se a queda temporária das emissões representará algum alívio para a crise climática.

 “Se alguns poluentes continuarem diminuindo em São Paulo, podemos chegar próximo aos níveis de qualidade do ar recomendados pela Organização Mundial de Saúde [OMS], o que mostra o tamanho do desafio que é atender ao padrão da OMS”, avalia Ferreira.

 Ele recomenda que, após a pandemia, o caminho para diminuir a emissão de poluentes em São Paulo passe pelo investimento em transporte público, que tem benefícios para a mobilidade urbana, em vez de se focar apenas a mudança da fonte de energia.

 “Ainda assim, se a frota hoje fosse de [carros elétricos](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/sobretudo/rodas/2020/03/carros-eletricos-se-dao-ate-melhor-em-caso-de-alagamento.shtml), a quarentena não representaria uma diferença, pois eles não geram emissões”."

Comments will be sorted by new.

>**What's New:**

>On Saturday, March 28, 2020, DHHS announced 27 new positive test results for COVID-19. There have now
been 214 cases of COVID-19 diagnosed in New Hampshire. The new cases are 17 adult females, 9 adult males,
and one male under the age of 18. The new cases reside in Rockingham (11), Hillsborough other than
Manchester and Nashua (4), Merrimack (3), Grafton (2), and Strafford (1) counties, and the cities of Manchester
(3) and Nashua (3). Eight of the new cases have no identified risk factors. Community-based transmission
continues to increase in the State and has been identified in all of the counties with cases. Most of the remaining
cases have either had travel to domestic or international locations or have had close contact with a person with a
confirmed COVID-19 diagnosis. Three of the new cases were hospitalized for their illness; thus far, 33 patients
of the 214 positive cases (15%) have been hospitalized.
>Guidance for self-quarantine is available at: https://www.nh.gov/covid19/residents/documents/self-quarantinecovid.pdf

---

>Because COVID-19, and all respiratory illnesses, are most commonly spread through respiratory droplets,
residents should take the same precautions as those recommended to prevent the spread of influenza:

>• Stay home and avoid public places when sick (i.e. social distancing)

>• Cover mouth and nose when coughing and sneezing

>• Wash hands frequently

>• Avoid being within 6 feet (close contact) of a person who is sick

>• Avoid sharing drinks, smoking/vaping devices, or other utensils or objects 
that may transmit saliva

>• Disinfect frequently touched surfaces

After initially trying to cover up the outbreak, China implemented a very strict quarantine to restrict the spread of the virus. Italy and the USA -- through a combination of inaction, slow action, legal limits of government power, and traditional  norms -- failed to take the necessary precautions to prevent the outbreak from spreading.

Wuhan's medical systems were *initially* overwhelmed, but swift government action (again, after the initial cover up) got things under control. Italy installed its system [piecemeal and half-heartedly](https://hbr.org/2020/03/lessons-from-italys-response-to-coronavirus), and the President Trump [spent a month](https://youtu.be/ch7_t2Ri2Zg) unfoundely downplaying the severity of the virus"
2020-03-29,Kmlevitt,japan,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/japan/comments/fp89rw/47_new_corona_virus_cases_in_tokyo_today/fltod8b/," While Japanese voters can be complacent under normal circumstances, when shit really hits the fan they are willing to go to the ballot box about it.  The LDP got thrown out of office a few years after the bubble burst, and then again after the Great financial crisis. After that, the DPJ got thrown out for the Fukushima crisis.  It’s not at all impossible that Abe’s long lucky streak as Prime Minister could end because of this pandemic crisis. 

 But mainly, I think he had an incentive to downplay infections because of the Olympics. You can’t blame him for hoping against hope it could still be held; Japan spent enormous amounts of money on it and has really been counting on it to boost the economy this year.  He wanted to tell the world that Japan had the coronavirus under control the same way he told them that Japan had Fukushima under control (Which they also don’t)."

2020-03-29,greyuniwave,Biohackers,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Biohackers/comments/fqnvd8/news_bulletin_a_most_important_coronavirus/fltnjwh/,"**Solution**: You can change your risk factors now, and help your loved ones too. Stop eating starchy farinaceous carbohydrates, stop eating fruit (especially the high glycaemic load fruits), stop eating foods that spike your blood glucose constantly and cause your pancreas to secret insulin. You can rapidly change your health situation by doing this. Time restrict your eating window; this will super boost correcting hyperinsulinaemia and put it back to healthy levels.

  

  

4.  There is strong evidence linking blood pressure lowing drugs eg. Lisinopril and Losartan with these Cytokine Storms, which lead to respiratory failure. ACE-inhibitor and ARB drugs (blood pressure lowering drugs) up-regulate angiotensin receptors on cell membranes within the lungs. Coronavirus COVID19 have been indicated to use these receptors. These drugs are often prescribed to people with diabetes, hypertension, hypothyroidism, medicated hyperthyroidism, cardiovascular disease (all of these diseases are manifestations of hyperinsulinaemia), hypertension is one of the major pre-existing conditions contributing the higher fatality rates we are seeing.
    

  

  

Now is the time to work on your health, prevent hyperglycaemia due to carbohydrate food ingestion, and bring your insulin levels to a healthy physiological concentration that is healthy for you, to protect yourself and your family from COVID-19 and its sequalae.

  

  

The way you can know you are achieving this is by testing your blood glucose and blood ketones (for those who want to know for sure and are data obsessed).

  

There is strong evidence that those with high HbA1c also suffer worst outcomes. This is partly because HbA1c is a clinical marker of hyperglycaemia and often hyperinsulinaemia, however an individual may have “normal” HbA1c levels due to hyperinsulinaemia, which results in a false negative with regards to this marker for diagnosing hyperinsulinaemia. The other reason why elevated HbA1c may be predictive for a worst COVID-19 prognosis is due to low oxygen saturation that comes with high HbA1c.

  

  

Being an excellent fat burner (and further towards being in ketosis) makes a massive difference here. Not just because it improves HbA1c value independent of insulin (remember insulin treatment can lower HbA1c but increase morbidity and mortality – The Accord study (NIH, 2015). Richard Veech demonstrated that being in a state of ketosis increases ATP production per oxygen molecule consumed (Sato  _et al.,_  1995), and the ATP produced from ketolysis carries greater Gibbs free energy potential within the third phosphate bond. Thus, decreasing oxygen demand to produce more ATP whilst concomitantly decreasing reactive oxygen species (ROS) due to increased production of anti-oxidative intracellular machinery as well as the ketone body beta-hydroxybutyrate acting as an anti-oxidant that directly scavenges the ROS hydroxyl radical.

  

In addition to decreasing carbohydrate consumption, getting into ketosis via multiple modalities such as time restricted feeding (TRF), intermittent fasting (IF), eating one meal a day (OMAD), eating a very low carbohydrate-moderate protein-high healthy fat diet (VLCHF) ketogenic diet (KD), those who currently have high HbA1c's would benefit from eating high sulphate foods and soak in magnesium sulphate. As the sulphate molecule is a haem independent way for oxygen to be transported to cells.

Now is the best time to start working on your better health program.

This is what I have been told by my attorney who handles MANY bars and clubs in Texas.

1. Wine is the big loophole when it come to being able to pre-mix your beverages. Ex: If your drinks are wine based, you can sell premixed drinks such as Margaritas as long as they are “sealed.“ Sealed can be ziploc bagged, saran wrap or even taping the lid down. This is how the drive thru Daiquiri places have been able to get away with it for years  

However,

2. If your to go beverages are liquor based (margarita, pina colada, Daiquiri, specialty cocktail) the to go beverage must be free of alcohol with small, manufacturer sealed  liquor bottles served on the side. These bottles have to be 375ML or less. The business CANNOT mix the drink.  

3. You may also sell any sealed beer and wine 

4. Alcohol must be purchased with a food item. This is the tricky part that even attorneys can’t figure out. Some local bars are selling bags of chips or brownies as a food item while another is selling full bbq plates. It still seems to be up for interpretation.

The good news is that there is not a food to drink ratio. They can buy as  many alcoholic drinks as long as there is ONE food purchase.

I hope this helps in any way possible. If a hear anything new, I will try to update. Also, if you have any questions, I will try to answer to the best of my knowledge or attemot to find it if I don’t.

“To be clear, the Center for Health Security and partners did not make a prediction during our tabletop exercise. For the scenario, we modeled a fictional coronavirus pandemic, but we explicitly stated that it was not a prediction,” the center said in a statement. “Instead, the exercise served to highlight preparedness and response challenges that would likely arise in a very severe pandemic. We are not now predicting that the nCoV-2019 outbreak will kill 65 million people. Although our tabletop exercise included a mock novel coronavirus, the inputs we used for modeling the potential impact of that fictional virus are not similar to nCoV-2019.”

In other words, the event centered on a made-up coronavirus — and not one with the same features of the virus currently spreading. The fictionalized scenario involved a disease starting in pig farms in Brazil and spreading around the world, leading to 65 million deaths. Again, that was all made up for the simulation. Videos of, and information on, the event are easily accessible online; the Center for Health Security has hosted similar events in the past, too.”

I don’t get it, seems pretty obvious they would run simulations on coronavirus considering it’s hit us before. Is there a conspiracy I’m missing?"

Hell a fucking bandanna is better than nothing.

In Mizoram, state govt has taken all measures to ensure that the essential commodities, foodstuff under PDS and vegetables will be made available to the people during the 21-day lock down period. While stating this, Chief Minister Zoramthanga yesterday said, this will be undertaken by the Local Task Force, by reaching out to every family.
The Chief Minister Zoramthanga assured that the Supply Committee formed under the State Level Task Force on COVID 19 will see that vegetables and other crops in the state are being harvested and also distributed safely among the people during the total lockdown period.
He said systematic distribution system is already chalked out with the help of Local Task Force. He has also thanked the volunteers of the local task force in becoming the backbone for management of citizens during the time of crisis.
Chief Minister also assured of safety to Mizo people locked- on outside the state. He said, Lok Sabha MP C Lalrosanga and Rajya Sabha MP Ronald Sapa Tlau have been monitoring the situation.
 Maharashtra Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray has announced that Shops selling essential commodities will be allowed to stay open 24 hours of the day.
The Chief Minister's Office statement said that the decision was taken to prevent crowding at shops and marketplaces amid the lockdown to contain the coronavirus pandemic.
It said that Thackeray held discussions with senior officials who are in charge of special control room for coronavirus set up at the Mantralaya or the state secretariat about how to ensure smooth supply of essential goods earlier in the day. With 5 deaths and 125 coronavirus cases, Maharashtra is, highest in the country in COVID-19 outbreak. 
 
In Tamil Nadu, nine different committees have been formed with senior IAS officers to address concerns over the movement and availability of essential goods to all during the curfew period. A decision on this has arrived after a marathon review meeting held by the state Chief Minister Edappadi Palaniswamy with district collectors and superintendents of police via video-conferencing. Later, the administration issued a statement in Chennai saying, in all district headquarters, a help centre would be established to ensure the movement of essential goods to all places. Section 144, initially promulgated till the end of this month is being extended up to 14th April when the curfew ends.
Private lenders have been directed not to insist on payment of interest and principal for the loans they have given to the poor until further orders due to their job loss. The lenders have been warned of dire consequences if they violate the directive.
District officials have been asked to give identity cards to people other than government servants who are involved in the movement of essential goods.
Besides e-commerce agencies, small retail outlets are also allowed to make door delivery of dry groceries and vegetables.
The list of about 54-thousand people who came from abroad recently has been shared with all district collectors. They have been asked to ensure their proper quarantine.
AIR correspondent reports that the Government Multi-Super Speciality Hospital in Chennai has been converted into a 350-beded facility exclusively for Covid-19 treatment. Isolation wards, step-down wards and medical and paramedical teams are put in place. In Chennai alone, there are over 20-thousand homes that are declared quarantined. However, the city Corporation Commissioner has appealed to public that they should not be considered as people with patients. He has clarified that the action is only a precautionary measure. He has appealed to the public having vacant homes or lodges to give them temporarily to the civic body to augment the isolation and quarantine facilities in the city. Meanwhile, a third private diagnostic centre has been approved by the Indian Council for Medical Research in Chennai.
In Himachal Pradesh, statewide curfew has been relaxed for six hours daily for the public to make essential purchases. Chief Minister Jairam Thakur urged the people to come out of their homes only in the emergency situation as the curfew have been enforced for their safety.
In the wake of COVID-19 pandemic, the state government has decided to extend the closure of all the offices of the state government till 31 March except those notified by the state government as essential services.
In order to facilitate people for their daily needs curfew has been relaxed from 7:00 am to 1:00 pm daily across the state. The relaxation in curfew is only to facilitate people to buy their essential commodities not for commuting from one place to another un-necessarily. Only one family member has been allowed to go out for purchasing during the relaxation period. Chief MinisterJairam Thakur directed the District Commissioners’ to explore the possibility of home delivery through major departmental stores of urban areas which would be helpful in observing social distancing. Jairam Thakur also urged the people of the State to buy essential commodities from groceries nearer to their homes as it would be helpful in breaking the COVID-19 chain. 
Meghalaya Chief Minister Conrad K Sangma has said that there is no reason for panic buying as supply of essential commodities will be made available across the State during lockdown period. The statement comes after certain parts of the State witnessed panic buying when some relaxation was given for public to buy essential food items.
Chief Minister's Office said that purpose of social distancing and lockdown will be defeated if people do not follow the directives of the Government and District Administration, who have been working tirelessly to ensure that essential items and services of the Government is made available to the people.
The Chief Minister informed that essential food items will be made available to the public by the administration in different localities."

Just not gonna happen.

As for Dreams, i think getting in trouble for music theft would be a worse position for MM to find themselves in as artists & companies are getting more and more protective over their licenses, especially now with streaming cutting into their profits and coronavirus cancelling music tours which is where most of an artist's money is made. 

I know it kinda sucks, i'm a musician myself and i hate how music sounds in Dreams and the process of making it with a controller, i'd much prefer to  make music externally with real instruments and then import, but i can see that it's a more dense minefield for Mm to let people drag them across when they can't effectively keep their dreamiverse free from the junk that seems to be flooding it already.

2020-03-29,AdvancedIQ,testingground4bots,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/testingground4bots/comments/fqvsnk/test/flt27ek/,"!enlightenme President Donald Trump said on Friday that he will not adhere to a portion of the $2 trillion [coronavirus stimulus bill](https://www.vox.com/2020/3/25/21192716/senate-deal-coronavirus-stimulus) that would authorize an inspector general to oversee how $500 billion in business loans will be spent.

In  a statement released early Friday evening, Trump  announced that he had  signed into law the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and  Economic Security or  CARES Act, [a relief package aimed at](https://www.vox.com/2020/3/27/21196202/house-passes-2-trillion-coronavirus-stimulus-package) mitigating some of the [economic fallout](https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2020/3/21/21188541/coronavirus-news-recession-economy-unemployment-stock-market-jobs-gdp) caused by efforts to allay the spread of Covid-19.

That  bill also establishes a Special Inspector General  for Pandemic  Recovery (SIGPR) within the Treasury Department to audit  and  investigate half a trillion dollars in loans for large businesses.  In  his signing statement, Trump said that this provision raises   “constitutional concerns,” adding that his administration would not   comply with such an official’s request for documents.

“I  do not understand, and my Administration will not  treat, this  provision as permitting the SIGPR to issue reports to the  Congress  without the presidential supervision required by the Take Care  Clause,”  part of [Article II Section 3 of the Constitution](https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/articleii)   that states a sitting president “shall take care that the laws be   faithfully executed.” This seems to suggest the administration believes   it is the president’s duty and not that of an inspector general to   ensure the funds are distributed as the law intends.

The  special inspector general, as authorized within the  bill, would be  able to request information from government agencies and  report on  failures to comply with those information requests. In his  signing  statement, Trump essentially stated that he will not let such  reports  reach Congress without his approval, which many fear directly   undermines the provision’s goal of maintaining transparency in how that   fund is handled."

I purchased it March 2019 and everyone was pretty much assured the upgrade would be free IF you purchased within a year... and since v5 was supposed to be released before end-of-year, cool - I'd get a free upgrade.

Beyond their explanation of re-engineering the foundation of the product, they have announced absolutely nothing specific-- at all. Just ""we're putting in all these cool features for you."" 2019 is over. Early 2020 is over (this is the very end of q1)... and no specifics have been announced. Really?

There are some things that I love about S3D and there are some things that really really need to be fixed. I have no idea if those things are going to be fixed--no one does. No one knows when the software is actually coming, if ever. No one knows anything except it's gonna be reallllly realllly great with stuff we all want.

Now with coronavirus, everything in the world is likely to be delayed -- more than likely S3D too (and just FYI I do understand a delay from CV but they are already incredibly late.) If the release was going to be anytime soon they would have told us more about what we can actually expect by now.

We don't even know pricing yet. Ugh.

I just bought a Creality CR-10s Pro v2 and am going to move to Cura for the time being -- it is being updated all the time... and the price is ~~hard~~ impossible to beat.

I really don't mind upgrade fees in general but I do feel like I've been conned out of my free upgrade in this case.

**tldr:** Simplify3D-- let us know what we're getting, when we're actually going to get it, and how much that upgrade fee is going to be. ASAP. Give me a reason to want to give you money!"

I didn't want to get an inhaler during this time because of the unneeded risk of going to medical/walk-in clinics, so I planned to wait until the coronavirus situation got better to go get an inhaler. During this time my asthma symptoms were getting progressively worse… 

Then I woke up one morning not being able to breathe, with no known triggers and I couldn’t even walk 10 steps before collapsing because I was so out of breath. So I was rushed to emergency. My lungs were completely full of fluid and I felt like I was drowning. I also had a persistent productive cough which produced chunks of thick green/yellow mucus (ew… I know). Also had digestive issues. These symptoms all happened very suddenly overnight. 

After doing a chest X-Ray, they decided to do a COVID-19 test as my lungs showed severe and abnormal opacities which looked like COVID-19 lungs. They tested me since I wasn't able to breathe and the X-Ray image looked very much like Covid opacities. Since the mucus was green/yellow they thought it could be viral rather than just asthma, and maybe my asthma was being exacerbated by a viral respiratory infection. I was also in close contact with someone who was very ill with flu/pneumonia who did not yet have their test results. 

I did not go to emergency thinking I had Covid, but the doctors concluded that my abnormal and severe X-Ray image merited testing. 

I am also considered to be in the immunocompromised/vulnerable category because of my asthma which is probably a main reason why they tested. 

Luckily my test was negative, the alarming X-Ray images were likely due to my untreated asthma getting progressively worse, possibly combined with bronchitis infection, as well as previous vaping/smoking (which produces crushed glass opacities in the lungs that are almost identical to COVID-19 lungs). For about a week after the test I was hacking & coughing up chunks of mucus and out of breath, even with my inhaler, so was very worried about my results when I didn’t hear back from them. This has all now gone away and I have gotten my negative results, hooray!"

If you're a regular person, you should not have a mask. You should be staying home. Staying home isn't an option for first responders and people in healthcare. They need the masks.

Do your part. Stay home. Let the front lines use the protective equipment. This isn't complicated, and it hasn't been confused by experts. They're all saying the same thing.

As for ""airborne""... This has a very specific meaning when it comes to virulence. Technically this coronavirus is not airborne, but it can exist in particles in the air (sneezes, coughs, etc) for a little bit, until those particles fall out of the air (a matter of minutes/hours, depending on conditions). That's not the same as it being airborne and part of the atmosphere."

He's one of the shitshow in chief's largest fundraisers in the southeast, donating over $100k himself and holding several large fundraisers.

The US cannot effectively deal with COVID-19 effectively and also cannot help other countries too. Perhaps more countries will regard the US as an unreliable partner. While the US says that it keeps the world safe from ""terrorism"" and ""threats"" like Russia and China, it couldn't protect its own citizens and assist others to address a real threat. If the US cannot give some of the ""advanced"" partner countries material benefits, then there are fewer reasons for those countries to cooperate and integrate itself with the US's economic order and security apparatus. 

>An annual survey by my organization, the [Eurasia Group Foundation](https://twitter.com/EGFound)  (EGF), fielded in the weeks leading up to the pandemic, found broad  support for America’s continued global leadership. Nearly 80 percent of  respondents across nine diverse countries believed that, compared with  China, having the United States “as the world’s leading power” would be  better for their country.   
>  
>But this preference is fueled more by pragmatism and  self-interest than many in Washington might presume. Of a list of  rationales for picking the United States over China, the two most  frequent responses were, respectively, that the United States is a  trustworthy economic partner, and that their country has a history of  working closely with the United States. Less frequently selected reasons  were related to democracy, freedom, and human rights. The least popular  option was that the United States “sets a good example for national  development for my country.”

Yes, everyone knows that the US's values, such as ""democracy"", ""freedom"", and ""human rights"" are bogus. No one really aligns with its ideologically.

The US seems to be adversely affected more than its rivals. If that's so, it will take years for it to regenerate its GDP through economic growth, while China has made advances in critical industries, such as jet engines, semiconductors, and medicine."

The only thing more clueless than this statement is your spelling of *cite.* I’ve gotta laugh. Apparently I’m a CCP shill, but even I understand basic English. You really are a product of the American education system aren’t you? **You’ve** already proven that you are peddling misinformation. **You** shared a graph that clearly contradicted your claims, and not only that but I’ve already [cited a source](https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/) that shows China is still reporting infected on a daily basis.

PM Modi on Friday interacted with Radio Jockeys (RJs) via video conference. Prime Minister appreciated the role played by the RJs in spreading awareness about COVID-19. He said it is praiseworthy that even in lockdown, RJs are discharging their responsibility and  recording programmes from home.
Prime Minister said that through the reach of the programmes, RJs are like members of families of millions of Indian households. People not only hear but also follow them. RJs have a great responsibility not just to disseminate and disabuse superstitions but also motivate people.
Apart from spreading information about the views of experts and steps taken by the government, PM also requested RJs to provide feedback about the difficulties and challenges faced by the people so that the government can proactively resolve them.
Prime Minister exhorted the RJs to disseminate positive stories and case studies, particularly of those patients that have fully recovered from coronavirus infection, and also inter-play such stories in different parts of the country, thus bringing the entire country together.
He also asked them to showcase and constantly celebrate the contributions of the local heroes like police officers, doctors, nurses, ward boys etc. at national level.
Prime Minister said that as mass communicators, the RJs can play a  proactive role in informing their listeners about the announcements, along with educating them about social distancing and the importance of self-quarantine.
In their response, the RJs called the Prime Minister as a part of the RJ fraternity since he has been hosting the widely successful Mann ki Baat on radio since 2014. Pointing out the unprecedented response to Prime Minister’s call of ‘Janta Curfew’  and his innovative idea of thanking the front line warriors, the RJs praised the leadership fo the Prime Minister and said they would be happy to play the role of the voice of the nation in the battle against the pandemic."

Overall when he goes off script that’s just him being the idiot he is. However I do feel calling it the “China Flu” and not stopping even after being made aware of its negative effects was a very conscious decision because he knew the left would explode over it and pay attention to that while he and his monster friends rolled back EPA laws creating a horrific new scenario for safe water, beef safety inspections, destroying part of what is called “The Crown Jewel” of America’s National Parks. All of this so his corporate, beef plant owners and the always present oil industry cronies can pollute and rape the environment at will saving them millions of dollars in being responsible earth dwellers. 
  Yes. THIS is what Trump has been doing during the pandemic. Not saving lives, not getting medical people the supplies they need, not creating a plan to help put a stop to coronavirus spread. No. He’s been turning back Obama EPA legislation so the rich can get richer.

The system was never supposed to be as robust as an RPG, it just gave you the option for more banter between characters. You could avoid most of it if you decided to immediately accept missions or progress the story. I'd love to see some new lines recorded with the original actors for a DAH! 2 Remake though, especially some fresh jokes! Hearing Crypto hit on Natalya or make fun of Pox being a hologram can get old.

2) Escort Missions: I actually feel that the escort missions aren't that egregious. You cut through enemies like butter, especially in the saucer. Improvements could certainly be made to companion AI though, that way they don't get stuck on debris as much. After playing DAH! 2 and Path of the Furon back to back while all this coronavirus business has been going on gave me perspective on just how abysmal the escort missions in the latter game are.

3) Co-op: The one thing I'd add to this is either getting rid of the tether or making it ridiculously long. Also having the option to have TWO saucers instead of having one player stuck as the gunner would be awesome. Many a middle school argument was had by me and a friend over who would get to pilot the ship. Including a way to split the dialogue options between players and referencing the fact that there are two Cryptos running around would be nice too."

My point is, 
Yes, we have to squeeze more from government and it indeed is government's responsibility. But we also need to act. We should find a way to communicate any lags and other situations to government instead of just sitting and comparing European countries with india and feeling good about ourselves for being and commenting on Reddit.

Sure it does. Anything that gets America over the panic and FUD does. Flattening the curve means that the news cycle will cease being a nonstop shitshow of doom and gloom. It means politicians will have political cover to MODERATE their response and allow the economy to function again to begin a rapid recovery.

Coronavirus has been overblown from the start, thanks to a combination of factors. The latest doom and gloom scenario is ""yeah, COVID19 might not be that deadly under normal circumstances, but OMG we don't have enough ICU beds and ventilators to handle the MASSIVE SPIKE incoming!"" Well, a flattening curve completely eviscerates that scenario.

Coronavirus will be with humanity in a significant way for years. That doesn't matter. All that matters was the FUD causing economic paralysis. Things won't be completely normal for a while, maybe, but if they get back to say, 90% of normal, that's good enough.

Peak travel season is still months away. Airlines and other related industries make most of their money during the summer. We have a lot of time to wind down the FUD between now and then. The enormous bailouts might end up being a huge windfall if we end up in recovery sooner than later."

He said the daily rate of increase in cases this time last Sunday was about 25 to 30 per cent.

>On Feb. 5, with fewer than a dozen confirmed novel coronavirus cases in the United States but tens of thousands around the globe, a shouting match broke out in the White House Situation Room between Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar and an Office of Management and Budget official, according to three people aware of the outburst.

>Azar had asked OMB that morning for $2 billion to buy respirator masks and other supplies for a depleted federal stockpile of emergency medical equipment, according to individuals familiar with the request, who spoke on the condition of anonymity about internal discussions.

>The previously unreported argument turned on the request and on the budget official’s accusation that Azar had improperly lobbied Capitol Hill for money for the repository, which Azar denied, the individuals said.

>The $2 billion request from HHS was cut to $500 million when the White House eventually sent Congress a supplemental budget request weeks later. White House budget officials now say the relief package enacted Friday secured $16 billion for the Strategic National Stockpile, more money than HHS had asked for.

>The dispute over funding highlights tensions over a repository straining under demands from state officials. States desperate for materials from the stockpile are encountering a beleaguered system beset by years of underfunding, changing lines of authority, confusion over the allocation of supplies and a lack of transparency from the administration, according to interviews with state and federal officials and public health experts.

>The stockpile holds masks, drugs, ventilators and other items in secret sites around the country. It has become a source of growing frustration for many state and hospital officials who are having trouble buying — or even locating — crucial equipment on their own to cope with the illness battering the nation.

>Despite its name, it was never intended for an emergency that spans the entire nation.

>“The response contains enough for multiple emergencies,” said Richard Besser, a former acting director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Now president of the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, he previously led the CDC’s Coordinating Office for Terrorism Preparedness and Emergency Response that oversaw the stockpile during Hurricane Katrina. “Multiple does not mean 50 states plus territories and, within every state, every locality.”

>The federal cache has been overwhelmed by urgent requests for masks, respirators, goggles, gloves and gowns in the two months since the first U.S. case of covid-19 was confirmed. Many state officials say they do not understand the standards that determine how much they will receive.

>Anecdotally, there are wide differences, and they do not appear to follow discernible political or geographic lines. Democratic-leaning Massachusetts, which has had a serious outbreak in Boston, has received 17 percent of the protective gear it requested, according to state leaders. Maine requested a half-million N95 specialized protective masks and received 25,558 — about 5 percent of what it sought. The shipment delivered to Colorado — 49,000 N95 masks, 115,000 surgical masks and other supplies — would be “enough for only one full day of statewide operations,” Rep. Scott R. Tipton (R-Colo.) told the White House in a letter several days ago.

>The Federal Emergency Management Agency inherited control of the stockpile barely a week ago from HHS. Lizzie Litzow, a FEMA spokeswoman, acknowledged the agency maintains a spreadsheet tracking each state’s request and shipments. Litzow declined repeated requests to release the details, saying the numbers are in flux.

>Florida has been an exception in its dealings with the stockpile: The state submitted a request on March 11 for 430,000 surgical masks, 180,000 N95 respirators, 82,000 face shields and 238,000 gloves, among other supplies — and received a shipment with everything three days later, according to figures from the state’s Division of Emergency Management. It received an identical shipment on March 23, according to the division, and is awaiting a third.

>“The governor has spoken to the president daily, and the entire congressional delegation has been working as one for the betterment of the state of Florida,” said Jared Moskowitz, the emergency management division’s director. “We are leaving no stone unturned.”

>President Trump repeatedly has warned states not to complain about how much they are receiving, including Friday during a White House briefing, where he advised Vice President Pence not to call governors who are critical of the administration’s response. “I want them to be appreciative,” he said.

>At briefings, Trump and Pence routinely say material is being purchased for the stockpile, supplies are being shipped out and manufacturers under federal contract are ramping up supplies. On Thursday, Pence said the stockpile had shipped 9 million N95 masks and 20 million surgical masks, as well as “millions” of gloves, gowns and face shields.

>But Trump and Pence also urge states to buy supplies on their own. During the March 19 briefing, Trump said governors “are supposed to be doing a lot of this work. . . . You know, we’re not a shipping clerk.”

>State officials say the advice is unrealistic.

>“Allowing the free market to determine availability and pricing is not the way we should be dealing with this national crisis at this time,” said Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam (D). “This is why we need a nationally led response.”

>Leaders in the District, Maryland and Virginia say their requests for aid from the stockpile have come up short. They have been competing with their counterparts to try to buy gear on the open market.

>“The federal government has the keys to the front door,” said Nirav Shah, Maine’s state health officer and director of its own Center for Disease Control and Prevention. He said the state has been scouring the country and overseas for companies that can supply protective masks. The stockpile, he said, is a critical “leg of the stool.”

>Hospital industry executives agree.

>“There is no [protective gear] to be bought on the private market through vendors,” said Kevin Donovan, president of Lakes Regional HealthCare, which has two hospitals in central New Hampshire. “We order but don’t have any money to pay for it,” because companies manufacturing masks and other emergency gear are demanding cash payments on delivery. Donovan said his hospitals, like others, are low on cash because they have canceled the elective procedures that are their moneymakers.

>“Unless we start getting material from the national stockpile,” Donovan said, “I don’t know where we are going to get it.”

>Stocking the stockpile

>Severe organizational and financial challenges left the national stockpile unprepared when the novel coronavirus arrived in the United States.

>The stockpile program was created at the end of the 1990s in response to terrorist events. The original goal was to be prepared for chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear threats. The reserve, for example, was stocked with nerve agent antidotes, stored and maintained at more than 1,300 locations around the country, where they could be accessed quickly.

>Inside the secret U.S. stockpile meant to save us all in a bioterror attack

>In the decades since, its mission has widened to include responses to natural disasters and infectious disease threats.

>Even with its expanded mission and supplies, the stockpile’s “original design and its current funding do not support responding to a nationwide pandemic disease of this severity,” said Greg Burel, who was the stockpile’s director for a dozen years before he retired in January.

>The last time it was deployed on a national basis was during the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic, when the stockpile distributed 85 million N95 respirators, along with millions of other masks, gowns and gloves. Afterward, trade groups and public health agencies called for the stock of masks to be replenished, but the supplies were not significantly restored, according to health-care industry and public health experts.

>Face masks in national stockpile have not been substantially replenished since 2009

>Officials at the CDC, which previously oversaw the stockpile, focused their annual budget of roughly $600 million over the past decade purchasing lifesaving drugs and equipment for bioterror and other attacks, rather than equipment vital in a viral pandemic.

>In late 2018, the Trump administration transferred responsibility for managing the stockpile from the CDC to a different part of HHS — a controversial move resisted by the CDC that placed the stockpile under the assistant secretary for preparedness and response (ASPR). According to current and former state and federal officials, the handover was bumpy.

>The CDC still oversees clinical guidance to state health departments responding to public health threats, including infectious diseases. But the stockpile’s resources are now under ASPR.

>“The transition has been difficult because the left hand is not talking to the right hand,” said one state health official with more than a decade of experience in emergency preparedness, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he needs to maintain relations with ASPR."

Based on my reading, very specific. You can read the the Inspectors General Act and The CARES Act to find out or challenge me but I think it covers pretty much everything. 

> But I don't see where the details of the report are established to the  degree needed to enforce it in court - and that's where the discretion  likely lies. 

I don't follow. The Inspectors Generals Act specifies if the IG makes a a report or complaint it shall be forwared to Congress without any alterations. If the department head wishes they can so add additional context as part of a seperate report. 

Have you read the Inspectors Generals Act or the relavent sections of teh CARES Act? If you haven't I invite you to do so since if you can cite parts of the law on a law reddit it would be most welcome. 

>I'm not trying to say they can't,  they can play here, I'm asking very specifically if they did, and the  article is not informative, and the law is rather large and very  recently issued.

I would start reading at Section 4018 (Page 547). Happy reading.

>Congress has repeatedly failed  oversight in thisnarea for over a generation, so I'm not sure why you  think they are more qualified here than yourself.

I don't proport to know if using subpoenas or IG's is better. I don't know if using a commitee or IG's is better. I don't think the average person knows which is better unless they have some relation to law such as a lawyer, Congressperson, or IG or otherwise knows the system and the pros and cons of both. I think the current provisions are pretty robost since we have a backup of a Congressional commitee to oversee the bailout funds."

ademas enserio vas a dudar de millones de personas que vieron y hasta fueron pacientes del virus? una gripe no mata gente joven a menos que sean vulnerables y te aseguro que hay casos de jóvenes 100% saludables que contrajeron la enfermedad y o fue grave(a tal punto que necesitaron incluso un puto ventilador) o literalmente se cagaron muriendo y no fumaban ni eran diabeticos o otras cosas.

 tene en cuenta que por ejemplo son como 40000 muertos en ee.uu aprox de gente muerta por gripe por año y en 4 meses tenemos mas de 25000 con solo medio millón de infectados(la gripe infecta a millones) a nivel global;vos estas seguro de que es buena idea apostar a que tenes razón? 

y otras cosa mas, yo estoy al tanto de este coronavirus desde inicios de diciembre cuando estaban los rumores(porque china intento ocultarlo algunos dias) y no sabes la cantidad de ideas conspiranoicas que se soltaban(arma biologica,control de poblacion,etc). si yo no fui otro imbécil mas cayendo en las estupideces de ese tiempo menos lo voy a ser ahora que hay gente asegurando que las drogas contra la malaria funcionan cuando ni siquiera fueron testeadas aun(actualmente están en estudio y no ha salido confirmación solo es/son casos anecdoticos) y ni hablar de otras cosas como la del agua caliente o el mate(un boludo de crónica dijo esto increíble,increible la verdad....)

el pánico solo lo tiene quien no esta informado,mis padres son vulnerables y aun así están tranquilos respetando la cuarentena mientras toman las precauciones y no son los únicos que fueron serios y eligieron ser razonables también creo que vos también podes serlo así que por favor te invito a ver la evidencia con respecto al coronavirus,si queres creer que es un arma créelo pero por favor no minimices la enfermedad."

They means that every part we touch is going to touch a hundred people's hands over the course of 20 minutes. On our line, we make 1600 units a day. That's a lot of things being touched by a lot of people.

We were originally going to be off for 2 weeks. We, as a union, fought like hell to get that. 40 minutes before the last day, we were informed it would only be one week. 

Now they are taping off every other urinal, taping off every other sink, the tables in the break areas and cafeterias are gone. We have to get our temperature checked, every time we come in the building. Fans will be taken away, which are our only way to keep cool. The jobs are being separated by shower curtains.

Most of these urns are people whose death was recorded from other causes.

The truth is in what the mayor of Bergamo, Italy has stated - that they are burning bodies 24 hours a day and the death count is four times what is being reported.

Only the privileged would even be placed in urns, most of the cremations in Wuhan were people burned in body bags 24 hours a day in crematoriums as well as portable mobile incinerators that photos have been posted of, this also means that photos of phones piled up indiscriminately by the hundreds and thousands were also real and did at one time belong to the victims.

By far, the vast majority of bodies burned during the lockdown would be thrown straight into the incinerator with nothing more than body bags. There would be no time to make note of most victims, let alone store their ashes. Urns and ashes would be for special cases only.

The true death count from CoronaVirus in Wuhan is probably anywhere from twenty thousand to one hundred thousand or more. The woman who was recorded in a Taiwan taxi exclaiming about bodies being taken and burned alive I’m sure was telling the truth. That would have happened if space was needed and there was no hope for a victim. Most of them in that situation were given oxygen and not a whole lot else as staff would have been overwhelmed in the satellite hospitals. They either recovered or they were cremated."

Brazilian streaming platform GloboPlay, owned by the country’s largest TV channel, announced that video streaming in 4K and Full High Definition would be temporarily suspended as of Monday to preserve Brazil’s internet infrastructure and allow more people to access its contents.
Asked about future plans to lower streaming quality in Brazil, like it did in Europe, Netflix said it “will continue to work with internet service providers and governments all over the world and will apply these changes in other places if necessary.”
Local telecoms regulator Anatel has signed a commitment pact with carriers and other providers to keep Brazilians connected during the coronavirus outbreak, creating a crisis committee to coordinate actions and monitor data traffic and the network capacity.

Shirley Leung

6-7 minutes

This is how far a business is willing to go to generate revenue during the coronavirus pandemic.
GameStop, the video game retailer, sent employees in Massachusetts back to work on Friday — despite the statewide order [shutting down all nonessential businesses](https://www.mass.gov/info-details/covid-19-essential-services-faqs). But instead of allowing customers inside, the store is doing curbside pickup, and employees have been given a set of specific and highly unusual instructions to let people pay at the door, according to a manager at a local store.

Workers have been told to wrap a plastic bag around one hand to protect it from exposure to the virus, open the door a crack, and take the customer’s credit card, the manager said. Employees are then to run the card with a hand still encased in the bag, flip the bag inside out, leaving the card inside, put the purchase in the bag, and hand it back through the door.

Customers can also order and pay for products online and pick them up at the door.

The instructions e-mailed from a district leader to managers on Monday almost seemed like a prank, said the 24-year-old manager, who asked to remain anonymous because he feared retaliation.

The message, titled “Chip card best practices,"" says: “Lightly (you want to be able to get it off easily) tape a Game Stop plastic bag over your hand and arm. Do not open the door all the way —keep the glass between you and the guest’s face — just reach out your arm.”

""It's like they're an animal or a pet,"" said the manager.

The manager said it was “infuriating” that he is being sent to work at a video game store and and being told to protect himself with a plastic bag while a pandemic is raging.

“I have to make a choice between doing a job that nobody needs during a pandemic and not being paid, and possibly infecting people or being infected,” he said. “We know for a fact the disease is contagious even when you’re asymptomatic.”
GameStop is not considered an [essential service](https://www.mass.gov/doc/covid-19-essential-services/download), according to the state, and is not allowed to offer curbside pickup. Violators may face criminal penalties or a civil fine of $300 per violation. The manager said the district leader explicitly told him that the store had permission from the state to open.
GameStop did not respond to questions about allowing payments at the door and instructing employees to wrap plastic bags around their hands. The company also did not address the fact that its services are not considered essential in Massachusetts. Employees who answered the phone at several area stores confirmed that customers could come to the store and pay with credit cards.

In a statement, the company said: “With employee and customer safety as our paramount concern, all our stores remain closed to customer access, including those in Massachusetts. We are processing orders on a digital basis through our new curbside Delivery@Door shipping service. Only employees may enter our stores at this time. Importantly, all GameStop employees have been assured that they do not have to work if they are not comfortable, or need to stay home to care for a family member. While GameStop is best known as a provider of gaming and home entertainment systems, we also offer a wide array of products and devices that are important to facilitate remote work, distance learning, and virtual connectivity.”

More than 15 states have ordered nonessential businesses to close, each with their own definition of what services are still allowed. Among those [allowed to remain open](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/27/nyregion/coronavirus-essential-workers.html) around the country: liquor stores, bicycle shops, a candy manufacturer, gun sellers, and golf courses.

A number of businesses with tenuous claims to being essential have also been [keeping their doors open](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/25/business/coronavirus-essential-retailers.html). Dog groomers in Massachusetts are grabbing on to the exception in the state’s nonessential business shutdown order for “organizations and workers responsible for the care and custody of animals, pets and livestock,” according to Cheryl Purcell, a dog breeder and groomer in Hanover who shut down her business.
Pet grooming is not considered essential in Massachusetts, the state said.

On Sunday, GameStop started limiting its operations to [online sales and curbside pickups](http://news.gamestop.com/news-releases/news-release-details/gamestop-provides-us-store-operations-and-customer-service), and business was booming, said the manager, who worked Monday and said it was busier than he expected it to be. On a conference call discussing Sunday sales, store leaders kept saying, “we earned $2 million in one day,” said the manager, who wasn’t sure how many stores that involved.
After the state shutdown order went into effect Tuesday, stores were shut down for several days before reopening on Friday for curbside pickup, according to the manager.
GameStop, which is based in Grapevine, Texas, and operates more than 5,500 stores worldwide, according to its website, has been struggling in recent years as gamers increasingly play online. The company announced in September that it was closing up to 200 stores by the end of last year, according to news reports, and on Friday, it said sales declined 26 percent last quarter on a same-store basis.

But GameStop chief executive George Sherman said on Thursday that with millions of Americans stuck at home for the past few weeks, demand for video games had increased. “The COVID-19 outbreak has led to changes in how consumers work, play, and learn,” he said in a statement. “While still early, we are pleased with the progress we have made to date in our initiatives to stabilize, optimize, and transform the business.”"

That's the whole point: the hospitals don't need them yet, the hospitals aren't at their apex, the hospitals have enough ventilators today, but their numbers are going *up*, we're planing for an apex, a high point in about 21 days; *that's* when we need the 30,000 ventilators, not today. Right now, we are putting them in a stockpile. So, the point is ""Well, there in a stock pile; you must not need them"". It's just ignorant; of course you don't need them today; we need them when you hit the apex, which is 30,000. We're not there yet.

So, even ignoring the fact there is nothing here to confirm the claim the ventilators came from the federal government, the preparatory work the Governor is doing sounds like a perfectly reasonable precaution, especially when you consider the [fact](https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2020/03/16/816707182/map-tracking-the-spread-of-the-coronavirus-in-the-u-s), New York today now has 53,399 cases. Do you want the state to wait until people are dying and in need of a ventilator before trying to acquire them?"

Health officials in British Columbia have reported that 45 per cent  of those positive for COVID-19 have now recovered from the virus – a  stat far greater than any other province in Canada to date.

But that is in part because B.C. has chosen to determine who no  longer has the virus differently than other provinces seeing the lion’s  share of cases, such as Ontario, Alberta and Quebec.

Provincial health officer Dr. Bonnie Henry said during her daily  COVID-19 media briefing on Saturday, March 28, that if a person with the  novel coronavirus only exhibits mild symptoms and doesn’t have to be  hospitalized then they are determined to be recovered once they’ve  reached 10 days without showing any symptoms.

Meanwhile, Ontario has only reported eight cases as resolved, with 1,126  active confirmed cases and 18 fatalities. Thirty-three people have  recovered in Alberta, where there are currently 507 active confirmed  cases and two deaths. 

Ontario is currently relying solely on negative tests to confirm which patients have recovered"

\~39% of delegates this primary when we have many more candidates to choose from shows us that some people actually do like Sanders rather than just hate Clinton.

> You mean like they told everyone they would be? Haven't *you* told people things close to this, this election?

Yet in practice, the angry twitter people did not define the rest of his supporters.

The most I've said is that I do not like Biden whatsoever and would drop him in a heartbeat for anyone to the left of him. I'm willing to say that on this sub because everyone here is already voting blue no matter what. Even the ones who hate Bernie almost as much as I hate Trump

To other Anti-establishment types, I tell them that a Trump presidency will result in supreme court appointments that will cripple anything left of fascism for decades. The only path forward is with a blue candidate. 

To Trump supporters, I tell them that Trump only plans on ""fill the swamp"" with people like Rod Blagojevich or Michael Milken, cripple the CDC's pandemic response to stick it to Democrats, and is economic decisions will bring forth another recession, coronavirus just sped up the timeline. In that same conversation, I am more than willing to say that even guys like Tucker Carlson admit that the only person who deserves to win the presidency is the candidate that can guarantee affordable education to rebuild the middle class, that's Biden now.

Saying you do not need to wear a facemask if you are not sick is still the wrong message period. They probably should be telling everyone that a mask is highly recommended when going out in public to reduce your risk of infection and possible transmission as you might be carrying the virus and be asymptomatic, wearing anything is better than nothing (e.g. if you do not already have a N95 mask) etc.

>Se debe mantener un balance entre el impacto económico/social de las medidas y el beneficio que se puede obtener. A cuánta gente le vas a quitar o bajar su ingreso y por cuánto tiempo, si lo haces muy pronto puedes causar inseguridad, valemadrismo, pobreza, psicológico por aquello de estar encerrados más de un mes, y en general un golpe duro a la economía.

Con todo respeto, pero esto es una maroma digna del mas ferviente pejelover. Este fue el argumento mas recurrido por el gobierno para retrasar las medidas, pero no tiene fundamentos. Solo para que quede mas claro: En Brasil (somos “gemelos” en casi cualquier indicador macro de cualquier área) los “fifis” están haciendo manifestaciones para no seguir la cuarentena/aislamiento social impuesto por los gobernadores (igual que México), la respuesta de los sectores vulnerables de la sociedad “nos quieren obligar a regresar a trabajar para que nos infectemos”.

Se les viene exigiendo desde hace rato que ordenen el paro de las actividades no indispensables, no puedes parar la economía del país en un día.

De primera mano te puedo decir que el Covid 19 esta en México desde enero, que personas del sector salud viajaron de Wuhan a México en diciembre 2019 y sus familiares (importación) se enfermaron, igual los compañeros de trabajo de los familiares (transmisión local).

28,330 deaths to be precise.

He blindsided New York’s governor Saturday by publicly announcing a potential quarantine order on the state’s residents, only to retreat from the idea hours later. This came a day after he authorized his government to use the Defense Production Act, a move on which he’d been taking an on-again, off-again stance, but it remains unclear whether that power will be used.

And he is due to issue new guidelines next week about whether the country should continue social distancing practices — but he’s vacillated between all but declaring victory against the coronavirus and acceding to experts who say the national slowdown may have to continue for several more weeks. ...

Say 100 people suddenly need hospitalisation for coronavirus and we then have 50 beds, what happens then???

It is purely to slow the rate at which people need to use medical services as once, every single country, regardless of death rate is taking those measures.

2020-03-29,HereForTheMayMay69,dankmemes,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dankmemes/comments/fqt5u8/ive_won_but_at_what_cost/fltrmfn/,"Test kits are not the issue. There are now plenty of test kits. 

USG has been surprisingly transparent through this whole thing. The numbers you see from the US are not the true numbers. But it’s due to lack of testing in some states. It’s also important to remember that in some states, such as California, they’re only testing moderate to severe cases, because they’re the ones that need the medical services and fast. 

US manufacturing is now on the case so it’s only a matter of time before we have 40,000+ ventilators, plenty of hospital beds and PPE. 

The US is strange in that their health department is not centralized. 

Sure, we have the CDC, but they’re there for recommendations. At the end of the day, each state is responsible for their own response. 

That’s why you see some states like Colorado rocking it and other states like Alabama crashing and burning. 

That said, there is the option of the president locking down the country (Medical martial law) in which I believe the health system is then centralized, but they’re trying to avoid it for obvious reasons. 

There are stay at home orders scattered across the US, problem is, enforcement is weak. It’s hard to contain a people that’s used to doing whatever the heck they want, whenever they want. That’s why martial law is probably inevitable. 
Huge fines like Germany for breaking the order isn’t a bad idea. 

What foreigners need to take away from all this. The US system is kinda weird. We ranked #1 in the world for pandemic preparedness some years ago, but when rubber meets the road, some of our state governments just couldn’t make it happen.  The president made a major mistake early on, because while his “Coronavirus response team” were working hard in the background, he tried to calm the markets. Of course, they saw through him and the crash happened anyway. When the first death occurred, Trump realized it was a big deal and switched tone to mitigation, no matter the cost. “The markets will come back. Lives don’t.” Is day early response was weak. Response now is strong. Needs to be stronger."

Who remembers the reaction when Trump shut down direct travel from China? 

<raises hand> He was accused of racism. The NYC health officials openly encouraged people «to enjoy the [Chinese New Year] parade and not change any plans due to misinformation spreading about #coronavirus. » They lauded the « powerful show of defiance of #coronavirus scare »

And then on Friday afternoon, (Friday evening in Jakarta time) Pope Francis gave Urbi et Orbi blessing regarding this Coronavirus outbreak. His ending prayer hit me hard. I became too paranoid about current situation. I finally fully realized I didn't do ""waspada boleh tp jangan sampe paranoid"" correctly.

My mindset in the beginning was that so many people die of the flu, especially immunocompromised people, and nobody gives a single shit. So much of the general public doesn’t get their flu shot even though it’s strongly recommended by the CDC and it’s free without insurance at every pharmacy. Literally the day lockdowns started in my area, I had this poor man in his 50s, who I had been working with all week and grown close to, die from the flu. I was so angry, I was thinking, “we’re really going to shut down the entire economy for coronavirus but turn a blind eye to people who have been dying from the flu? People who couldn’t be bothered to get their flu shots to protect themselves and immunocompromised people are now telling me I’m the devil for going to the grocery store?” 

I will admit that I wasn’t factoring in that with the coronavirus, although symptoms can be similar to the flu, we don’t have a vaccine or a treatment, and we can see firsthand how rapidly and severely it affected other countries. I’m definitely grateful for people staying home because the virus hasn’t even hit my hospital hard and we’re already almost out of supplies. 

I still can’t bear to read what a lot of the general public’s opinions on this though, I had to delete my Facebook because of it. Also by next fall I will reactivate Facebook and remind all of the local coronavirus dictators to keep their same energy by getting their flu shot, lol. But again, I’m glad most people are taking staying home seriously since it’s all we can really do to slow this down right now."

They are also primarily a Japanese company and Japan doesn't observe Good Friday and Easter. Also very short-sighted to say you ""guess most of the western world are in the same situation,"" as every area is different and even in areas where they observe the holiday, many stores remain open. There's definitely places that are shorted by the new release date, but a) it's not their fault, as a lot more goes into releasing a AAA product than  lining up religious-based holidays around the world, and b) if you are delayed it's only a couple of days. Disappointing, but far from a tragedy.

In any case, Good Friday is not the problem with the release right now. The problem is the reactions to coronavirus, as many places around the world are locking down or limiting in-person sales and operations. Here in the US there are multiple states that have enacted a ""stay home stay safe"" policy that has led to many places closing down. Speaking from my experience, the Gamestop that I pre-ordered from (and all the ones nearby) have decided to flat-out close for the next month or so. Can't get through and won't be getting it any time soon since we can't do the delivery thing. Sucks, but it happens. There's a lot of more important things than playing a game on release day.

2020-03-29,sand313man,greece,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/greece/comments/fr2b2d/αρρώστησα/fltr7li/,"Firstly read this article:

[Antibiotic resistance: the hidden threat lurking behind Covid-19](https://www.statnews.com/2020/03/23/antibiotic-resistance-hidden-threat-lurking-behind-covid-19/)

The above article is very important for you to understand that cleanliness is important. In as much of a way, to avoid secondary bacterial infection during your time with COVID-19 (if you have it).

 You could probably get in touch with a doctor, online if possible, and possibly even order medications remotely based on the doctors advice.  (antibiotics and such can be helpful - but contact a GP online) There are many services. If they do not exist in Greece, do not hesitate to book an online consultation with someone from a country whose health care system you trust. 

Here is the NHS advice - UK:

[https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/coronavirus-covid-19/symptoms-and-what-to-do/](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/coronavirus-covid-19/symptoms-and-what-to-do/)

Do not leave your home if you have coronavirus symptoms

Do not leave your home if you have either:

* **a high temperature** – this means you feel hot to touch on your chest or back (you do not need to measure your temperature)
* **a new, continuous cough** – this means coughing a lot for more than an hour, or 3 or more coughing episodes in 24 hours (if you usually have a cough, it may be worse than usual)

To protect others, do not go to places like a GP surgery, pharmacy or hospital. Stay at home.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

The above is important to not infect others, but also to protect yourself as hospital are also risk places for you yourself to get the infection if you do not have it. 

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your symptoms worsen substantially you will need to call your authorities hospital, and check in. 

As can be seen in [This Imperial College study](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/media/imperial-college/medicine/sph/ide/gida-fellowships/Imperial-College-COVID19-NPI-modelling-16-03-2020.pdf) death rates are low, but need for ventilatory support to survive can be high depending on age around 8% for individuals 20-40 +- Accurate table is present on page 5 of the study.

This means that most people will get through this just fine. And death rate is extremely low even if you are in the 8% so long as you can gain access to vital hospital support, if you fall into the group that requires support.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Relax, don't panic. Isolate yourself, keep in communication by phone/internet with your close friends or family. Make sure you have the relevant numbers and access to hospital, if your situation worsens, and are struggling with severe symptoms. 

If not, wait it out, and Isolate yourself, for at least 7 days.. And anyone in the same household as you should Isolate for 14 days."

La medida se suma a la suspensión en los cargos por morosidad en el caso de los cheques rechazados luego de que este jueves se levantara el clearing bancario para la operatoria de estos instrumentos.
> 
> ""Hasta el 30 de junio inclusive, las entidades financieras no podrán cobrar cargos ni comisiones por las operaciones (depósitos, extracciones, consultas, etc.) efectuadas mediante todos los cajeros automáticos habilitados y operados en el país por ellas, sin límites de importe –salvo los que expresamente se convengan por razones de seguridad y/o resulten de restricciones operativas del equipo– ni de cantidad de extracciones, ni distinción alguna entre clientes y no clientes, independientemente del tipo de cuenta a la vista sobre la cual se efectúe la correspondiente operación”, comunicó el Central.
> 
> La extracción de dinero en cajeros automáticos es siempre gratuita, en cualquier cajero y en cualquier red, para quienes cobran sueldos, jubilaciones o beneficios sociales, hasta el límite de esos haberes. Pero los bancos pueden aplicar comisiones a quienes extraen por encima de esos montos. Hasta junio no se aplicará ningún tipo de recargo o comisión incluso en estos casos. El objetivo es que la red de cajeros sea un todo y no que el cliente opte por ir a un cajero de su banco para operar."

>  -En el Imperial College de Londres, que tiene un servicio muy bueno de epidemiología y de predicciones matemáticas, hay un profesor, (Neil) Ferguson, que hizo el modelo de las curvas que se achatan, o no, en epidemiología. Y que fue tomado para todas las decisiones políticas gubernamentales por consejo de la Organización Mundial de la Salud, sin discutir ni poner en tela de juicio las ecuaciones. Yo desde el principio empecé a analizar esto y vi que había algo raro. A mi eso no me cerraba. **Anteanoche, este señor Ferguson dijo que la proyección que hicieron debía ser masivamente disminuida -tal la palabra que usó en inglés- con respecto a las cifras de muertes.**
> 
>  
> 
>  -Que, por ejemplo, para los Estados Unidos él proyectó con su modelo -que todo el mundo está utilizando en este momento sin siquiera cuestionarlo-, 2.200.000 fallecimientos; y 500 mil en el Reino Unido si no se tomaban las medidas de achatar la curva y todo lo que significaba eso. Ahora dice que no, que las predicciones no parecen ser exactas. Lo mismo que sucedió con el H1N1. Predijeron muchísimas menos muertes ahora, siempre que se mantengan las medidas de cierre como las que tomaron los gobiernos. Las estimaciones son mucho más bajas.
> 
>  
> 
>  -Dice que el bloqueo las va a mantener. Pero el bloqueo para achatar la curva se hizo en función de los primeros cálculos, que daban un coeficiente de transmisibilidad y mortalidad mayor. Pero ahora dice que ya no es como le daba antes, que está en el orden del 3 o 2,5, dentro de los valores de la gripe. Y dijo el miércoles que, por las estimaciones que revisó y las medidas de cierre adoptadas por el gobierno británico, los hospitales van a atender a la gente infectada y **morirán más o menos 20 mil personas por el virus... o por la excitación que van a provocar otras dolencias asociadas al virus.**
> 
>  
> 
>  -Infartos, accidentes cerebro vasculares… **Porque usted va al hospital y si muere por un infarto, dirán que murió por el virus. El problema es que ahora se mezcla todo. Una persona que llegue por una tentativa de suicidio y que se tomó un remedio por estar resfriada, murió por el virus.** Alguien con un ACV mal manejado, si está resfriado, murió por el virus, no por el accidente cerebro vascular. El dice que hay que corregir la cifras porque solo se está considerando eso. Por supuesto, en Oxford hay otro epidemiólogo que dice estar sorprendido porque se haya aceptado de manera tan incondicional por parte de las organizaciones internacionales el modelo de Imperial College. Ellos están haciendo otro tipo de modelo predictivo y dicen que este virus se ha propagado de una manera invisible y descontrolada por lo menos un mes antes de lo que cualquiera hubiera sospechado, y si se empieza a hacer test a la población probablemente la mitad haya sido infectada, y que entonces la mortalidad es mucho más baja y el riesgo también. Si eso es verdad, uno de cada mil infectados sería el que enferme y necesitaría hospitalización, porque el 86 por ciento no tiene síntomas serios. Esto apareció ayer en Inglaterra.

>  -De cada 100 personas que van a consultar, 86 por ciento padecen síndrome gripal. El médico, en ese caso, le va a hacer un análisis de sangre y le pedirá cuatro parámetros, que el laboratorio le puede hacer en media hora o una hora. Ahí se puede saber si la persona tiene o no una infección viral. No le va a decir si tiene coronavirus. Tiene un virus. Influenza, adeno, cualquier otro. Pero se necesitan laboratorios que puedan hacer dímeros, proteínas C reactivas, recuento globular… Si los dímeros positivos dan altos, alguna lastimadura tendrá en el pulmón. Y se hacen enzimas hepáticas y se pide un ionograma para ver como esta el potasio. Si dan, la persona tiene un virus, sea corona o no. Si esas cosas no están alteradas, lo mandan a la casa y le dan tratamiento de gripe. ¿Entiende? **Hasta aquí no hace falta pánico, y hablamos del 85 por ciento de la gente. Pasó en Corea, China, y en todo el mundo.**
> 
>  
> 
>  **-¿Qué sucede con el 15 por ciento que sí da infección viral?**
> 
>  
> 
>  -Puede ser grave. La única manera de saberlo es hacer un test PCR, que no es accesible en todas las ciudades, provincias o laboratorios. El costo de cada test es de 30 o 40 dólares y se necesita personal muy bien formado y materiales. Yo justamente estuve en la Argentina en diciembre, y dí una charla sobre cómo desarrollar test de biología molecular casero y que no sea caro. Pero para desarrollarlos hay que esperar por lo menos dos meses. Hay que comprar los de Corea, porque los chinos en este momento tienen un problema bastante serio, mucha gente no los quiere comprar más. Pero inclusive comprando el mejor test de Corea hay un 20 por ciento de falsos negativos.

Una radiografía no siempre da buenos resultados. Si el radiólogo dice que hay infección compatible con neumonía por coronavirus, esa persona tiene que ser internada en terapia intensiva, pero eso es para un máximo del cinco por ciento de las personas. Ahora, si no tiene resonadores o tomógrafos, ¿qué hace? No se sabe, y ahí empiezan los problemas.

Like commenting subreddits in other communities. Posting regular pictures. Share experience as a restaurant worker during Coronavirus. Reddit likes users with wide variety of interests. NSFW subreddits limits how much you’re exposed. Do AMA or something. Use the rest of reddit!

They started their testing back in mid-Jan, which is why they are doing so well as of now.

For those who don't know, Germany is one of the most affected countries by the coronavirus (around **58,247** cases as of now), yet their death rate is very low (**455** as of now).

Because of this they are able to help Italy in the transportation of patients with the help of their Air Force. Not just transport. Germany took in 50 ICU coronavirus patients from Italy and France, saying they had spare capacity.

Respect."
