I haven't seen much in the way of unusual activity but since I'm more on the bio side I do see a disproportionate amount of bad science regarding this outbreak relative to less hot topics. The general public cares a whole lot more about what is happening with this coronavirus than just about anything else in biology right now, so as such there's a huge and necessary push to get data published quickly.

This would lead to people with increased ACE2 receptors getting a bigger dosage of the virus. This could explain why China is hit worse than any other country because a lot of their population have damaged lungs from air pollution. It also suggest why it’s not taken a foothold in Europe as of yet due to the better air quality.

Paper explains that asymptomatic people are as contagious as people with symptoms. So my conclusion is the quarantine can’t work when you are just moving people with symptoms. You will
always be leaving asymptomatic but highly contagious people out.

Our analysis suggests that the viral nucleic acid shedding pattern of patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 resembles that of patients with influenza4 and appears different from that seen in patients infected with SARS-CoV.3 The viral load that was detected in the asymptomatic patient was similar to that in the symptomatic patients, which suggests the transmission potential of asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic patients. These findings are in concordance with reports that transmission may occur early in the course of infection5 and suggest that case detection and isolation may require strategies different from those required for the control of SARS-CoV"

1, A doctor’s general description of symptoms for the first three weeks of illness.

2. A day by day description of symptoms (from day 1 through day 12) and treatment for the first patient in the USA. He began feeling ill on Jan. 15, was admitted to the hospital on Jan. 20th, and was released from the hospital Feb. 3rd/4.


Item 1:
Symptoms explained by Doctor ihttps://www.straitstimes.com/asia/east-asia/reporters-notebook-life-and-death-in-a-wuhan-coronavirus-icu: 

“I've observed that the breakout period of the novel coronavirus tends to be three weeks, from the onset of symptoms to developing difficulties breathing. Basically going from mild to severe symptoms takes about a week. There are all sorts of mild symptoms: feebleness, shortness of breath, some people have fevers, some don't. Based on studies of our 138 cases, the most common symptoms in the first stage are fever (98.6 per cent of cases), feebleness (69.6 per cent), cough (59.4 per cent), muscle pains (34.8 per cent), difficulties breathing (31.2%), while less common symptoms include headaches, dizziness, stomach pain, diarrhea, nausea, vomiting.

But some patients who enter the second week will suddenly get worse. At this stage, people should go to the hospital. The elderly with underlying conditions may develop complications; some may need machine-assisted respiration. When the body's other organs start to fail, that's when it becomes severe, while those with strong immune systems see their symptoms decrease in severity at this stage and gradually recover. So the second week is what determines whether the illness becomes critical.

The third week determines whether critical illness leads to death. Some in critical condition who receive treatment can raise their level of lymphocytes, a type of white blood cell, and see an improvement in their immune systems, and have been brought back, so to speak. But those whose lymphocyte numbers continue to decline, those whose immune systems are destroyed in the end, experience multiple organ failure and die.

For most, the illness is over in two weeks, whereas for those for whom the illness becomes severe, if they can survive three weeks, they're good. Those that can't will die in three weeks.”


Item 2:

Symptom Progression Day 1 to Day 12 From
First Case of 2019 Novel Coronavirus in the United States 

35 year old male

https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2001191

On January 19, 2020, a 35-year-old man presented to an urgent care clinic in Snohomish County, Washington, with a 4-day history of cough and subjective fever. On checking into the clinic, the patient put on a mask in the waiting room. After waiting approximately 20 minutes, he was taken into an examination room and underwent evaluation by a provider. He disclosed that he had returned to Washington State on January 15 after traveling to visit family in Wuhan, China. The patient stated that he had seen a health alert from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) about the novel coronavirus outbreak in China and, because of his symptoms and recent travel, decided to see a health care provider....

Given the patient’s travel history, the local and state health departments were immediately notified. Together with the urgent care clinician, the Washington Department of Health notified the CDC Emergency Operations Center. Although the patient reported that he had not spent time at the Huanan seafood market and reported no known contact with ill persons during his travel to China, CDC staff concurred with the need to test the patient for 2019-nCoV on the basis of current CDC “persons under investigation” case definitions.8 Specimens were collected in accordance with CDC guidance and included serum and nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swab specimens. After specimen collection, the patient was discharged to home isolation with active monitoring by the local health department.
On January 20, 2020, the CDC confirmed that the patient’s nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabs tested positive for 2019-nCoV by real-time reverse-transcriptase–polymerase-chain-reaction (rRT-PCR) assay. In coordination with CDC subject-matter experts, state and local health officials, emergency medical services, and hospital leadership and staff, the patient was admitted to an airborne-isolation unit at Providence Regional Medical Center for clinical observation, with health care workers following CDC recommendations for contact, droplet, and airborne precautions with eye protection.

On admission, the patient reported persistent dry cough and a 2-day history of nausea and vomiting; he reported that he had no shortness of breath or chest pain. Vital signs were within normal ranges. On physical examination, the patient was found to have dry mucous membranes. The remainder of the examination was generally unremarkable. After admission, the patient received supportive care, including 2 liters of normal saline and ondansetron for nausea.


On days 2 through 5 of hospitalization (days 6 through 9 of illness), the patient’s vital signs remained largely stable, apart from the development of intermittent fevers accompanied by periods of tachycardia (Figure 2). The patient continued to report a nonproductive cough and appeared fatigued. On the afternoon of hospital day 2, the patient passed a loose bowel movement and reported abdominal discomfort. A second episode of loose stool was reported overnight; a sample of this stool was collected for rRT-PCR testing, along with additional respiratory specimens (nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal) and serum. The stool and both respiratory specimens later tested positive by rRT-PCR for 2019-nCoV, whereas the serum remained negative.

Treatment during this time was largely supportive. For symptom management, the patient received, as needed, antipyretic therapy consisting of 650 mg of acetaminophen every 4 hours and 600 mg of ibuprofen every 6 hours. He also received 600 mg of guaifenesin for his continued cough and approximately 6 liters of normal saline over the first 6 days of hospitalization.


A chest radiograph taken on hospital day 3 (illness day 7) was reported as showing no evidence of infiltrates or abnormalities (Figure 3). However, a second chest radiograph from the night of hospital day 5 (illness day 9) showed evidence of pneumonia in the lower lobe of the left lung (Figure 4). These radiographic findings coincided with a change in respiratory status starting on the evening of hospital day 5, when the patient’s oxygen saturation values as measured by pulse oximetry dropped to as low as 90% while he was breathing ambient air. On day 6, the patient was started on supplemental oxygen, delivered by nasal cannula at 2 liters per minute. Given the changing clinical presentation and concern about hospital-acquired pneumonia, treatment with vancomycin (a 1750-mg loading dose followed by 1 g administered intravenously every 8 hours) and cefepime (administered intravenously every 8 hours) was initiated.


On hospital day 6 (illness day 10), a fourth chest radiograph showed basilar streaky opacities in both lungs, a finding consistent with atypical pneumonia (Figure 5), and rales were noted in both lungs on auscultation. Given the radiographic findings, the decision to administer oxygen supplementation, the patient’s ongoing fevers, the persistent positive 2019-nCoV RNA at multiple sites, and published reports of the development of severe pneumonia3,4 at a period consistent with the development of radiographic pneumonia in this patient, clinicians pursued compassionate use of an investigational antiviral therapy. Treatment with intravenous remdesivir (a novel nucleotide analogue prodrug in development10,11) was initiated on the evening of day 7, and no adverse events were observed in association with the infusion. Vancomycin was discontinued on the evening of day 7, and cefepime was discontinued on the following day, after serial negative procalcitonin levels and negative nasal PCR testing for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus.

On hospital day 8 (illness day 12), the patient’s clinical condition improved.

Here is what should happen, the world should pledge one tenth of one percent of their GDP to the first company that can mass produce a vaccine under the condition that vaccine becomes license free for the world to use.

Given an $80 trillion economy, that comes out to $80 billion to the company that can produce a vaccine, paid proportionally to the size of each country's economy.

Smoking makes people more vulnerable due to damage to lungs, but cigarette smoke is hardly the only thing that can hurt your lungs.

And believe me, it isn't a stretch to say all these people smoked. Half my family is from Wuhan, so I go there quite often. Pretty much everyone either smokes or is exposed to 2nd hand smoke. Typical weekend is often families get together to play mahjong, and a lot of the men will smoke and it fills up the room.

The younger generations seem slightly better about it, but pretty much every one of my uncles smoke.

There still might be some other genetic component to COVID-19 but all this study is suggesting is that ACE2 is more related to smoking, not race. ACE2 is probably a factor in mortality but likely not the only thing."

Public-health officials in the U.S. are striving to keep tabs on thousands of Americans who have quarantined themselves at home after returning from mainland China to curtail the new coronavirus, adding to an epidemic response that is straining already-stretched local departments.
More than 5,400 people had been asked to self-quarantine in California alone as of Feb. 14, according to the California Department of Public Health. Hundreds more are self-quarantining in Georgia, Washington state, Illinois, New York and other states.
Public-health officials are following directions from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the State Department to supervise these people, but many steps are being developed on the fly. States are using a variety of techniques to track people from calling in volunteers to make phone calls, to sending text messages and using electronic registries.

These people are separate from the Americans who are under stricter federal quarantine, including those housed at four U.S. air bases and the 328 who were recently evacuated from the Diamond Princess cruise ship. Those groups arrived from locations where the virus was rapidly spreading, whereas the people self-monitoring at home are thought to be at lower risk of having been exposed to it.

So far, there have been 15 confirmed Covid-19 cases in the U.S., not including the potentially positive cases among those evacuated from the Diamond Princess. While health officials have investigated 467 people for the virus as of Monday, 392 tested negative, with 60 cases pending, according to the CDC. The immediate risk to the general public is still low, health officials say.
While public-health authorities are experienced with isolating, contact tracing and quarantining people to contain infectious diseases such as measles and tuberculosis, an attempt to monitor and quarantine people at this scale is a unique challenge. And quarantines typically apply only to those with a known exposure to a virus, rather than just travel history, public-health officials say.
“That’s a whole new scope of work,” Sara Cody, director of the public-health department in Santa Clara County, the home of Silicon Valley, which has had two confirmed cases of Covid-19. Both patients had returned from Wuhan, China, where the epidemic began.
TRACKING THE CORONAVIRUS

•Chinese officials celebrated a drop in the number of new coronavirus infections and deaths.
•China’s State Council called on “low-risk regions” around the country to resume full production.
•The Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention found that the most of confirmed cases were mild.
•The head of Wuhan’s Wuchang Hospital died of the coronavirus.
Tracking the Coronavirus
VIEW IN DEPTH
A coalition of staffers, employees from other departments, health-care providers and federal officials engaged in a classic outbreak response to monitor people, such as family and health-care workers, who came in close contact with two local cases. And now, the department has added tracking recent arrivals from China to their to-do list. “We’re still in the middle of figuring out these operations,” Dr. Cody said.
Travel from mainland China to the U.S. has been sharply curtailed since many airlines suspended flights and the U.S. barred entry to most foreign nationals arriving from China. Still, some Americans continue to arrive into 11 airports designated by federal officials, and health authorities are on the lookout for passengers who are coming from other countries but were also recently in China.
Los Angeles County, for instance, is adding dozens of returning travelers to its monitoring list daily, said Barbara Ferrer, the director for the L.A. County Department of Public Health.
Those without symptoms who haven’t been to Hubei province, which includes Wuhan, are allowed to go on to their final destinations, but are asked to stay at home for up to 14 days, monitor their health, check in with their local health departments and contact their health-care providers if they develop symptoms, such as a fever or dry cough.
They are asked to avoid close contact with others, typically defined as being within 6 feet of another person for a prolonged period. Sometimes those who are self-quarantining are told they may go outside and exercise if no one is nearby, or grocery shop. The orders aren’t binding, but local health officials can issue stricter quarantine orders if necessary. So far, most people are cooperative, local health officials say.

State and local health officials say they get information on people who are self-quarantining from federal officials who screen them at airports. But sometimes local officials receive incorrect or illegible phone numbers for some, or just missing data for others, and have to circle back to federal authorities for more information to track down the person.
Seattle and King County in Washington state, which have roughly 400 people self-monitoring at home, have recruited volunteers from the University of Washington School of Public Health and the department’s Public Health Reserve Corps, said Jeffrey Duchin, the health officer at Public Health—Seattle and King County. The county is spending roughly $200,000 a week on the response, which also requires redirecting staff from other tasks.

For people under strict quarantine or in isolation after developing symptoms, public-health workers sometimes need to provide more intense services, including shopping for food and medication. Seattle and King County offer a dietitian-reviewed menu and deliver bagels, turkey lunch meat, avocado salsa, fruit and hair conditioner, among other items, to a person under investigation waiting for test results.
“The amount of manpower, both resources and time, has been tremendous, and so what that means is that our existing staff are working two jobs around the clock for several weeks,” said Dr. Duchin. “It’s been like one big, long bad day.”

In Chicago, the health department is surveying people daily with an electronic registry, which is part of its monitoring practice for other infectious diseases, and is in contact with them more directly as needed. Other health departments phone or email initially, then sometimes follow up in a few days or a week.
On Monday, the Washington State Department of Health started using a text-messaging system developed by the CDC. The state will send a daily text to new arrivals and will refer anyone who reports fever or other symptoms to their local health departments. Washington says it is the first state to use the system. The CDC has made the tool available to any interested health departments and is using it to check in on some of its own staff on the ground responding to the epidemic in the U.S., said Anita Patel, the lead of pandemic medical care and countermeasures at the CDC.

Public-health authorities say they are also working to fight xenophobia and misinformation around the virus. The Chicago Department of Public Health held a press conference in Chinatown last week to announce that all of the close contacts of their two Covid-19 cases had passed the incubation period and had been cleared—and then the team had lunch with local business leaders in Chinatown.
The effort is straining state and local budgets. States and some larger local departments receive support from the CDC’s Public Health Emergency Preparedness funds, though the money is meant for preparing for an outbreak and doesn’t often cover full responses, they say.
“We’ve been keeping close track of those costs and expenditures with the assumption that there would be additional funding available in time,” said Allison Arwady, the commissioner at the Chicago Department of Public Health. “We’re paying our bills right now, but we absolutely need additional funding to be able to maintain the level of response this is going to require.”
Many health departments say they are in a good spot for now, as close contacts to the early confirmed cases are passing the incubation period without new infections popping up. But based on the continuing spread of the coronavirus, some health officials expect to be on high alert for the long-term, saying this type of aggressive response might not be sustainable. Strategies might also need to shift if the virus gets a foothold in the U.S.
“I just look around, and there are a lot of people here because they’re just committed to the mission, but they’re getting tired,” said Dr. Cody. “This is what they believe in, and that takes us a long way, but it won’t take us for months and months and months.”"

In the US \~ 8% of people get flu a year.   
Let's say that 75% of those get it during flu season, a number I pulled out of my ass.  
That implies 19.6 million flu cases every flu season.   


According to some other random websites, flu typically peaks Feb, December, March, January in that order of severity, with cases tapering off by April. So let's say there's a 6 month flu season, autumn and winter, and therefore there'd be about 3 million cases in any given month. I won't bother doing more back of the envelope shit for how long each of Covid19 and the flu last.  


What is clear is that if you have flu-like symptoms in the West, you almost certainly have the flu at this point... as we move into April, May etc. and seasonal flu tapers off, if Covid continues to grow, then your odds of it being coronavirus go up"

Quick googling shows a panic attack can cause momentary sharp pains much like you are describing. I've had them before and it felt like my chest was getting crushed.

You're not running a fever, and you don't have a cough, so you're probably just worrying too much.

Again, I'm not a doctor but the best thing you can do is to take care of yourself. Make sure to drink enough water, eat as healthy as possible, and don't skip out on sleep. Combine that with hand washing and maintaining as much personal space as possible and you'll be doing the best you can to avoid getting sick (with anything, not just Covid19).

If you continue to feel anxious, then you might do best finding some discreet activity you can do in public that calms you. A lot of people do breathing exercises, meditate, or put on a pair of earbuds and listen to soothing music. If you're religious, you can also add prayer to the mix.

For example, if we find an effective antiviral therapy or public health measures are effective at stopping the spread then we wouldn't even need a vaccine down the road.

A number of companies got burned badly during the West Africa outbreak because the outbreak was controlled in other ways and by the time the vaccine was ready it was already over.

I think it is heading in a good direction on r/Coronavirus. Before, I felt like the subs had little differentiation between them and what would be acceptable content for each subreddit. Now that we did the switch, I feel like we made the ""identities"" and rules of the subs much more clear.

> Have you noticed any unusual activity that you believe might be related to efforts to manipulate the narrative?

Like any large sub we get brigaded from different userbases. It can come from both sides, but we do our best to mitigate the effects of this. We also have to deal with sources that are less than credible, where the news source is clearly trying to spin a certain narrative. 

> Have you been in contact with any news organizations or have they reached out to you at all?

Not personally, nor am I aware of any news outlets reaching out to any other mods.

We appreciate the support. It can be tough when a vocal minority believes we are ""CCP shills"" or are ""censoring"" information. Of course we will make mistakes as we are not infallible - most of us are just scientists that are volunteering our time to help people have easier access the best, most reliable and up-to-date information available (as well as keep out the racists and trolls).

My personal view as a mod in what we are trying to do for the sub(s) is to provide a platform where we can have good, reliable sources from around the world congregate in order to have a place to for people to discuss the facts as well as a place for people to stay up to date on the virus. Unfortunately, there are a lot of sources out there that will post news stories without it being verified, leading to unnecessary fear mongering/anxiety and further exacerbates the spread of misinformation."

Please note that this will be my last post in this particular format. The 2-factor polynomial curve isn't a great fit any more, so I will be working on a new format to show the ongoing growth of worldwide numbers.

For those who continue to post suggestions about breaking out cruise infections, please note that this is intended to show the progressive growth of cases worldwide. There is no doubt that the cruise numbers have a major impact on the growth. Others have helpfully provided links to graphs that break these numbers out. Eventually the spike will work itself out. The purpose of this graph is to get an overall sense of the disease progress globally. The only reason China's numbers are not included is because there is significant doubt as to the veracity of these numbers, and so the decision was made from the beginning to leave them out. Everything else, including cruise numbers, are included to give us an evolving sense of the global situation.

Our world is in this for the long haul, and the more we know, the better we will be able to respond as a planet.

Thank you for all the encouraging messages from those who are finding this format helpful!

\-------

This is an animated gif showing the changing trendline day over day, as compared to the original extrapolation from Feb 1, 2020.

Methodology:Original extrapolation is a 2-factor polynomial best fit from Feb 1, 2020 (green line and dots). Each day I am plotting a new 2-factor polynomial best fit (blue line) from the actual data (blue dots). By comparing the blue and green lines, we can get a sense of how the rate of growth is growing (or shrinking) by comparison.

Original best fit polynomial equation: 0.5869x2+5.53664x - 10.162, where x is days since January 20 (start of data)

To preface, I will acknowledge that my belief in the Canadian Healthcare System might be a bit misplaced at times, but I do feel very strongly that our people have the population's best interests in mind.

I find that the media coverage in Canada to be a little underreported.  It is difficult to find out what exactly is going on in Ontario or BC when one or the other has reported a new case.  When that happens, the focus shifts away from the national news and more into the local coverage of how the public health department is handling the case(s).  In the case of Ontario, I feel that the focus needs to be more national rather than local; I don't care about the local coverage because I'm smart enough to go look for it -- I care more that the coverage is exposing the rest of the population of the seriousness of this virus.  

So when logging onto /r/Coronavirus or /r/COVID19, I find a great deal of relief to see there's common sense discussion.  At times, I find the community negativity to be undergirded by the mistakes made by our team of biting into more than we could chew before the recent influx of new moderators.  But I must say that we're getting better control over the fake news that often get posted -- our users are the best deterrents and you've all done a smashing job of helping us.

As for unusual activities, I haven't found anything, but I have found that people are trying to monetize the virus by spamming their crappy websites.  I've caught a few already, but there's always one in the background I haven't caught yet.  I'm keeping my eye out of those posts, but I think our team has been handling the issue brilliantly so far.  

We haven't had any MSM reach out to us to discuss the subreddits, but I do know a couple of us do reach out to verify information.  I think this is an important relationship that needs more nurturing because it will grant more reliability to the sources that are posted here.  I know we have discussed plans for having a dedicated list of sources to be permitted for posting within the subreddits (/r/Coronavirus and /r/China_Flu), but it's a big undertaking.  

I'm happy to hear that our work is being acknowledged, but there's still a great deal of work to do.  I want to have more consideration paid towards how our users title submissions and more consideration to encouraging scientific discussions in /r/COVID19 so that our users there feel more emboldened to discuss the problems we (the research community) might not have considered.

There's a lot of incredibly gifted people in each subreddit, and I'm always amazed by the creativeness of our users graphs and charts.  /r/dataisbeautiful would love some of them."

1, A doctor’s general description of symptoms for the first three weeks of illness.

2. A day by day description of symptoms (from day 1 through day 12) and treatment for the first patient in the USA. He began feeling ill on Jan. 15, was admitted to the hospital on Jan. 20th, and was released from the hospital Feb. 3rd/4.


Item 1:
Symptoms explained by Doctor ihttps://www.straitstimes.com/asia/east-asia/reporters-notebook-life-and-death-in-a-wuhan-coronavirus-icu: 

“I've observed that the breakout period of the novel coronavirus tends to be three weeks, from the onset of symptoms to developing difficulties breathing. Basically going from mild to severe symptoms takes about a week. There are all sorts of mild symptoms: feebleness, shortness of breath, some people have fevers, some don't. Based on studies of our 138 cases, the most common symptoms in the first stage are fever (98.6 per cent of cases), feebleness (69.6 per cent), cough (59.4 per cent), muscle pains (34.8 per cent), difficulties breathing (31.2%), while less common symptoms include headaches, dizziness, stomach pain, diarrhea, nausea, vomiting.

But some patients who enter the second week will suddenly get worse. At this stage, people should go to the hospital. The elderly with underlying conditions may develop complications; some may need machine-assisted respiration. When the body's other organs start to fail, that's when it becomes severe, while those with strong immune systems see their symptoms decrease in severity at this stage and gradually recover. So the second week is what determines whether the illness becomes critical.

The third week determines whether critical illness leads to death. Some in critical condition who receive treatment can raise their level of lymphocytes, a type of white blood cell, and see an improvement in their immune systems, and have been brought back, so to speak. But those whose lymphocyte numbers continue to decline, those whose immune systems are destroyed in the end, experience multiple organ failure and die.

For most, the illness is over in two weeks, whereas for those for whom the illness becomes severe, if they can survive three weeks, they're good. Those that can't will die in three weeks.”


Item 2:

Symptom Progression Day 1 to Day 12 From
First Case of 2019 Novel Coronavirus in the United States 

35 year old male

https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2001191

On January 19, 2020, a 35-year-old man presented to an urgent care clinic in Snohomish County, Washington, with a 4-day history of cough and subjective fever. On checking into the clinic, the patient put on a mask in the waiting room. After waiting approximately 20 minutes, he was taken into an examination room and underwent evaluation by a provider. He disclosed that he had returned to Washington State on January 15 after traveling to visit family in Wuhan, China. The patient stated that he had seen a health alert from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) about the novel coronavirus outbreak in China and, because of his symptoms and recent travel, decided to see a health care provider....

Given the patient’s travel history, the local and state health departments were immediately notified. Together with the urgent care clinician, the Washington Department of Health notified the CDC Emergency Operations Center. Although the patient reported that he had not spent time at the Huanan seafood market and reported no known contact with ill persons during his travel to China, CDC staff concurred with the need to test the patient for 2019-nCoV on the basis of current CDC “persons under investigation” case definitions.8 Specimens were collected in accordance with CDC guidance and included serum and nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swab specimens. After specimen collection, the patient was discharged to home isolation with active monitoring by the local health department.
On January 20, 2020, the CDC confirmed that the patient’s nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabs tested positive for 2019-nCoV by real-time reverse-transcriptase–polymerase-chain-reaction (rRT-PCR) assay. In coordination with CDC subject-matter experts, state and local health officials, emergency medical services, and hospital leadership and staff, the patient was admitted to an airborne-isolation unit at Providence Regional Medical Center for clinical observation, with health care workers following CDC recommendations for contact, droplet, and airborne precautions with eye protection.

On admission, the patient reported persistent dry cough and a 2-day history of nausea and vomiting; he reported that he had no shortness of breath or chest pain. Vital signs were within normal ranges. On physical examination, the patient was found to have dry mucous membranes. The remainder of the examination was generally unremarkable. After admission, the patient received supportive care, including 2 liters of normal saline and ondansetron for nausea.


On days 2 through 5 of hospitalization (days 6 through 9 of illness), the patient’s vital signs remained largely stable, apart from the development of intermittent fevers accompanied by periods of tachycardia (Figure 2). The patient continued to report a nonproductive cough and appeared fatigued. On the afternoon of hospital day 2, the patient passed a loose bowel movement and reported abdominal discomfort. A second episode of loose stool was reported overnight; a sample of this stool was collected for rRT-PCR testing, along with additional respiratory specimens (nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal) and serum. The stool and both respiratory specimens later tested positive by rRT-PCR for 2019-nCoV, whereas the serum remained negative.

Treatment during this time was largely supportive. For symptom management, the patient received, as needed, antipyretic therapy consisting of 650 mg of acetaminophen every 4 hours and 600 mg of ibuprofen every 6 hours. He also received 600 mg of guaifenesin for his continued cough and approximately 6 liters of normal saline over the first 6 days of hospitalization.


A chest radiograph taken on hospital day 3 (illness day 7) was reported as showing no evidence of infiltrates or abnormalities (Figure 3). However, a second chest radiograph from the night of hospital day 5 (illness day 9) showed evidence of pneumonia in the lower lobe of the left lung (Figure 4). These radiographic findings coincided with a change in respiratory status starting on the evening of hospital day 5, when the patient’s oxygen saturation values as measured by pulse oximetry dropped to as low as 90% while he was breathing ambient air. On day 6, the patient was started on supplemental oxygen, delivered by nasal cannula at 2 liters per minute. Given the changing clinical presentation and concern about hospital-acquired pneumonia, treatment with vancomycin (a 1750-mg loading dose followed by 1 g administered intravenously every 8 hours) and cefepime (administered intravenously every 8 hours) was initiated.


On hospital day 6 (illness day 10), a fourth chest radiograph showed basilar streaky opacities in both lungs, a finding consistent with atypical pneumonia (Figure 5), and rales were noted in both lungs on auscultation. Given the radiographic findings, the decision to administer oxygen supplementation, the patient’s ongoing fevers, the persistent positive 2019-nCoV RNA at multiple sites, and published reports of the development of severe pneumonia3,4 at a period consistent with the development of radiographic pneumonia in this patient, clinicians pursued compassionate use of an investigational antiviral therapy. Treatment with intravenous remdesivir (a novel nucleotide analogue prodrug in development10,11) was initiated on the evening of day 7, and no adverse events were observed in association with the infusion. Vancomycin was discontinued on the evening of day 7, and cefepime was discontinued on the following day, after serial negative procalcitonin levels and negative nasal PCR testing for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus.

On hospital day 8 (illness day 12), the patient’s clinical condition improved. Supplemental oxygen was discontinued, and his oxygen saturation values improved to 94 to 96% while he was breathing ambient air. The previous bilateral lower-lobe rales were no longer present. His appetite improved, and he was asymptomatic aside from intermittent dry cough and rhinorrhea. 

As of January 30, 2020, the patient remains hospitalized. He is afebrile, and all symptoms have resolved with the exception of his cough, which is decreasing in severity.

Do you stand there and begin to discuss/analyze the statistical chance of it being an avalanche?

Or take action to protect yourself.

Routes of transmission — Respiratory coronaviruses probably spread in a fashion similar to that of rhinoviruses, via direct contact with infected secretions or large aerosol droplets. Immunity develops soon after infection but wanes gradually over time. ^Reinfection is common, presumably because of waning immunity, but possibly because of antigenic variation within species [36].* n hospital settings, spread among pediatric patients probably occurs through shedding by their infected caretakers [37].

For those patients who have been cured, there is a likelihood of a relapse,"" Zhan Qingyuan, the director of pneumonia prevention and treatment at the China-Japan Friendship Hospital, said during a Friday press conference. “The antibody will be generated,” he added. “However, in certain individuals, the antibody cannot last that long.” Because some patients could get sick multiple times, it will prove even more difficult to track and contain the viral outbreak — which has already spread to and killed more people than did the entire SARS outbreak of the early 2000s.""

But Singapore is one of the most population dense areas in the world. They stay inside and run ac. Maybe it's a good example of a warm weather area for covid. And maybe not."

That’s why they only had 3 SARS infected people in their country. Yes a virus is able to mutate, but it’s not possible to mutate their entry point to human cells in short time. Also if a virus mutates, it becomes less lethal in 99% of the cases, because if a virus is too fatal, it would be a inefficient virus. 
You are criticizing my points and declare them invalid even though they are indeed proven. Try to do your own research about the topic, instead of being overly pessimistic about the topic. It isn’t as bad as many in this sub think it is. Sometimes i even believe, no one in this sub wants to hear good news, but instead spread fear and panic."
