# Person with confirmed coronavirus was at Westminster conference

Organisers contacting everyone who attended transport summit in central London venue  
  

&#x200B;

A person subsequently diagnosed with [coronavirus](https://archive.ph/o/rTZpR/https://www.ft.com/content/a8190d19-137b-39fb-aa5e-f5b55b2d9ce2) was at a central London conference attended by more than 200 people last week, it has emerged, as authorities rush to trace those who may have come into contact with the patient.

The unknown individual attended the UK Bus Summit at the QEII Centre, one of London’s largest conference halls, in Westminster on February 6.

Conference organisers Transport Times emailed attenders on Thursday afternoon on the instruction of Public Health England, informing them that a person confirmed to have the virus had been to the conference.

The email enclosed a letter from PHE, a government body. It told delegates to take no action if they were well but to stay indoors, avoid contact with others and call the NHS helpline if they developed symptoms such as a fever or cough.

“While the degree of contact you may have had with the case at the summit is unlikely to have been significant, we are taking a precautionary approach and informing you,” the letter said.

The bus conference listed about 250 delegates from the nationwide bus and transport industry, including several members of parliament and directors of national transport operators.

The catered event took place over one day and included demonstrations of electric buses and discussions on national bus policy. The QEII centre, which has a capacity of more than 2,500 people, hosted another conference, for asset managers, on the same day.

&#x200B;

 

Citing patient confidentiality, authorities declined to give any further information on the person who had coronavirus, including their other movements in the UK or whether they had travelled from abroad.

But officials indicated that the individual is among the [nine patients in England](https://archive.ph/o/rTZpR/https://www.ft.com/content/63a4eaaa-4dce-11ea-95a0-43d18ec715f5) who have already tested positive for coronavirus.

They pointed to a commitment by Chris Whitty, chief medical officer for England, that any new cases in the UK would be publicly announced.

Public Health England is now attempting to trace the contacts of each of those confirmed to have been infected by the virus, by collecting detailed information on a person’s movements before they were diagnosed.

Professor Whitty has previously said it is very unlikely that the virus can be passed on by someone who is not displaying symptoms, but authorities are monitoring the available information to determine whether this is a concern.

A spokesperson for Transport Times said it was “working closely with Public Health England, following their advice closely, and have distributed a letter of guidance from PHE to all attendees”.

On Monday the UK government declared the coronavirus outbreak “a serious and imminent threat to public health”. It has also gone further than many governments in taking new legal powers that mean the health secretary can force people to enter, or remain in, quarantine if they are thought to pose a risk of spreading the disease.

After the World Health Organisation designated the outbreak “a public health emergency of international concern”, the risk to the UK public was raised from “low” to “moderate”, although the government has said the risk to individuals remains low."

A passenger aboard a cruise ship docked in Sydney Harbour is being tested for possible coronavirus.

The Australian understands that NSW Health are assessing a Singaporean man who fell ill with a respiratory complaint.

The cruise ship arrived in Sydney this morning having believed to be at other Australian ports after travelling from New Zealand.

The Norwegian Jewel arrived in Sydney this morning at 6am and is docked at the international passenger terminal at Circular Quay.

The 294m ship has a guest capacity of 2376 people and 1060 crew.

A source said the man was being tested as a precaution and had not yet been confirmed to have the virus.

He has been taken from the ship. Passengers have now been allowed to leave the ship after earlier being prevented from disembarking.

The precautionary testing is in line with the Victorian government’s approach to a ship where a man had been suspected of having the virus but was later confirmed to have been clear.

Cruise ship Diamond Princess has been quarantined in the Japanese port of Yokohama after 218 coronavirus cases were detected — the largest cluster of infections outside China.

That ship has 3500 passengers and crew aboard.

In Cambodia, another cruise ship, the Westerdam, finally docked after being turned away by several Asian and Pacific governments. No cases of the viral illness have been confirmed aboard, according to the ship’s operator.

It’s a great piece of film because it perfectly portrays modern society. The glass sliding door is our tv, computer, and phones.

No matter what happens with the virus, people will always lust after chaos. People want to be afraid of the big bad event, because it’s been trained into us from childhood in almost every story we’ve read or watched. People simply expect a climax. 

In truth, there will be a climax, but it will be a different climax for every person here. Assuming the virus is as bad as we fear, my climax could be vastly different from yours.

7-9 minutes

For one coronavirus patient at ground zero of the outbreak, the journey from infection to recovery was a nightmare scenario that entailed multiple hospital visits, symptoms so severe he thought he would die and quarantine under police watch.

Tiger Ye -- not his real name -- is a 21-year-old student in Wuhan, the central Chinese city where the new, still little understood virus first emerged. Ye, who doesn’t want to be identified for fear of being ostracized, first suspected he’d caught the illness that’s spread around the world on Jan. 21, when he felt too weak to finish dinner. He checked his temperature, and it was up.

At the time, little was known about the virus now known as 2019-nCov, but paranoia was rapidly building after authorities confirmed the highly contagious pathogen was spreading between humans in the city of 11 million. It was midnight when Ye arrived at Wuhan’s top-tier Tongji Hospital to see a waiting room filled with people like him. Feverish, he knew he would have to wait hours to be tested.

“I was scared,” he said. “Countless cases were piling up on the desks, and every single doctor was wearing protective clothes, something I’d never seen before.”

What followed was more than two weeks of anxiety and desperation as Ye tried to confirm if he had the pneumonia-causing virus and get treatment for his increasingly severe symptoms. He was one of the lucky ones, beating the sickness in part because his father -- a health care worker -- was aware of the risks earlier than most of Wuhan’s population.
Under Siege

More than 1,000 people have died from the new coronavirus in Hubei, the Chinese province that Wuhan is the capital of, as a severe shortage of hospital beds, testing kits and other basic medical equipment mean many have to stand in line for hours to get diagnosed, and some die before even seeing a doctor. China has quarantined vast swathes of Hubei, and the outbreak has caused parts of the world’s second-biggest economy to shut down as scientists across the world race to find a cure.

Read about how China has sacrificed Hubei to try and stem the virus spread

The night Ye first sought treatment, he was able to procure medicine from a smaller hospital nearby after abandoning the wait at Tongji. Because his symptoms weren’t classed as very severe, doctors told him to just go home and quarantine himself.

The first four days of the illness were brutal.

“I suffered from a high fever and pains that tortured every part of my body,” said Ye, who’s a big fan of Japanese culture and has ambitions of becoming a voice actor. He spent the days watching Japanese cartoons to distract from the discomfort.
‘Coughing Like I Was Going to Die’

By the time his follow-up appointment at the hospital arrived four days later, the Wuhan government had locked down the city, barring anyone from leaving to stop the virus’ spread. Everything changed in an instant: roads were empty, prices for fresh fruit and vegetables surged, and residents were unsure if they were even allowed to leave their apartments.

Ye’s condition had also deteriorated. “I was coughing like I was going to die,” he said.

At the hospital, multiple CT scans showed it was highly likely Ye had contracted the novel coronavirus and that it had spread to his lungs. Doctors deliberated if he qualified for a nucleic acid test, which would use the virus’ genetic sequence to confirm if he had been infected, but it was decided his case wasn’t severe enough, and the precious supply of test kits had to be reserved for more critical patients.
‘Hell’s Door’

Diagnosis has emerged as one of the major stumbling blocks in getting the virus under control in Hubei, where the number of those who fear they are infected far outweighs the capacity of hospitals to confirm if they are. On Thursday, Hubei began counting patients who were diagnosed via CT imaging alongside those who tested positive with the nucleic acid kits, resulting in a more than 45% surge in the number of confirmed cases, to nearly 50,000 people.

As Ye convalesced at home after his second hospital visit -- not knowing if he had the virus or not -- his brother and grandmother also began to show symptoms of infection. Overnight, Ye’s condition worsened to the point he thought he might die.

“I thought I was knocking on hell’s door,” he said.

Ye went back to the hospital after his temperature soared to 39 degrees Celsius (about 102 degrees Fahrenheit). Doctors put him on an iv and administered Kaletra, a combination drug used to treat HIV that has shown some success in combating the virus, bringing his temperature down to 37 degrees by the end of the day.

China Stages Clinical Trial Blitz in Search of Coronavirus Cure

A week after the symptoms first began, Ye appeared to be reaching a turning point.
Virus Confirmed

The young student’s condition was steadily improving when he finally secured one of the coveted test kits on Jan. 29. It confirmed he had the virus that’s triggered travel bans around the world. His doctor gave him a five-day course of the antiviral drug Aluvia and sent him back to his three-bedroom apartment for quarantine, in part because the hospital didn’t have enough beds to accommodate him.

Nine days later on Feb. 7, another set of nucleic acid tests came back negative for the virus, but Ye wasn’t out of the woods. After reports that even patients who tested negative could slip into critical distress, the local government quarantined him in a hotel that had been turned into a makeshift hospital. Police stood guard outside to prevent anyone from leaving or entering.

Ye was allowed to go home five days later, ending a saga that began more than three weeks ago. He‘s thankful he survived, and salutes the doctors and nurses who put their own lives at risk to help him. Some doctors told him they suspected they had the virus, but continued to treat patients.

China’s Sick Doctors Show How Infection Breaches Fan Coronavirus

Like many Chinese, Ye is critical of the government’s response to the outbreak, especially the slow initial response from local officials that meant a precious opportunity to contain the virus early on was missed. The two most senior Communist Party cadres in Hubei were replaced Thursday, as Beijing tries to gain control of the spiraling crisis.

“Hubei has missed one opportunity after another while they were trying to keep things under wraps,” Ye said. “Things wouldn’t have come to this point if the government hadn’t hidden information a month ago.”

Viruses are very complex to say the least. There aren’t really any treatments for viruses except supportive care. They pretty much have 3 options: they die on their own, they kill you, or they stay dormant in your body. 

Even when you catch various viruses, they may have lasting effects on your overall health. Chicken pox for example may develop into shingles. HIV may develop into AIDS. There is never a cure. It’s ONLY supportive care. Even a regular flu can cause minor heart damage. 

This is why it’s so important to get a vaccine for common virus such as the flu. The problem with the coronavirus is that we don’t know what they lasting effects may be.

Most mainstream peer-reviewed or otherwise credible sources have reported r0 as being somewhere between 2 and 3.

This new *as yet unreviewed* article from a team working at Los Alamos does think it's significantly higher (between 4.7 and 6.6):

>The  novel  coronavirus  (2019-nCoV)  is  a  recently emerged human  pathogen that has  spread widely since January 2020. Initially, the basic reproductive number, R0, was estimated to be 2.2 to 2.7. Here we provide a new estimate of this quantity. We collected extensive individual case reports and estimated key epidemiology parameters, including the incubation period.Integrating these   estimates   and high-resolution real-time human travel and infection   data with mathematical  models,  we estimated that  the number of infected  individuals  during  early epidemic double every2.4days, and the R0value is likely to be between 4.7 and 6.6. We further show that quarantine and contact tracing of symptomatic individuals alone may not be effective and early, strong control measures are needed to stop transmission of the virus 

Given the behavior of the Chinese with the massive lockdowns and quarantines, I tend to think it's on the higher end of the spectrum.

A recovery story of a 21-year-old student

Ye, who doesn’t want to be identified for fear of being ostracized, first suspected he’d caught the illness that’s spread around the world on Jan. 21, when he felt too weak to finish dinner. He checked his temperature, and it was up.

It was midnight when Ye arrived at Wuhan’s top-tier Tongji Hospital to see a waiting room filled with people like him. Feverish, he knew he would have to wait hours to be tested.

The night Ye first sought treatment, he was able to procure medicine from a smaller hospital nearby after abandoning the wait at Tongji. Because his symptoms weren’t classed as very severe, doctors told him to just go home and quarantine himself.

The first four days of the illness were brutal.
“I suffered from a high fever and pains that tortured every part of my body,"" said Ye, who’s a big fan of Japanese culture and has ambitions of becoming a voice actor. He spent the days watching Japanese cartoons to distract from the discomfort.

By the time his follow-up appointment at the hospital arrived four days later, the Wuhan government had locked down the city, barring anyone from leaving to stop the virus’ spread. Everything changed in an instant: roads were empty, prices for fresh fruit and vegetables surged, and residents were unsure if they were even allowed to leave their apartments.

Ye’s condition had also deteriorated. “I was coughing like I was going to die,"" he said.

At the hospital, multiple CT scans showed it was highly likely Ye had contracted the novel coronavirus and that it had spread to his lungs. Doctors deliberated if he qualified for a nucleic acid test, which would use the virus’ genetic sequence to confirm if he had been infected, but it was decided his case wasn’t severe enough, and the precious supply of test kits had to be reserved for more critical patients.

As Ye convalesced at home after his second hospital visit -- not knowing if he had the virus or not -- his brother and grandmother also began to show symptoms of infection. Overnight, Ye’s condition worsened to the point he thought he might die.

“I thought I was knocking on hell’s door,"" he said.

Ye went back to the hospital after his temperature soared to 39 degrees Celsius (about 102 degrees Fahrenheit). Doctors put him on an iv and administered Kaletra, a combination drug used to treat HIV that has shown some success in combating the virus, bringing his temperature down to 37 degrees by the end of the day.

A week after the symptoms first began, Ye appeared to be reaching a turning point.

The young student’s condition was steadily improving when he finally secured one of the coveted test kits on Jan. 29. It confirmed he had the virus that’s triggered travel bans around the world. His doctor gave him a five-day course of the antiviral drug Aluvia and sent him back to his three-bedroom apartment for quarantine, in part because the hospital didn’t have enough beds to accommodate him.

Nine days later on Feb. 7, another set of nucleic acid tests came back negative for the virus, but Ye wasn’t out of the woods. After reports that even patients who tested negative could slip into critical distress, the local government quarantined him in a hotel that had been turned into a makeshift hospital. Police stood guard outside to prevent anyone from leaving or entering.

Officials with Quinte Health Care say someone has been brought to Belleville General Hospital from CFB Trenton today to receive care.

QHC’s Catherine Walker tells Quinte News the patient was brought by EMS and while the assessment is in the early stages, she confirmed that “there are no symptoms that would indicate the coronavirus COVID-19”.

Walker noted that QHC hospitals are equipped to care for anyone who might need to be isolated and that staff re prepared to care for any of the quarantined individuals who might need hospital-level care for any potential health issues.

There was no confirmation as to if the patient was, in fact, one of the people who are currently under quarantine at the base and due to patient confidentiality rules, no other specifics on why why were brought to hospital were released.

We’ve reached out to Public Health Canada for more information."

```
First, close monitoring is needed of changes in epidemiology and of the effectiveness of public health strategies and their social acceptance.
Second, continued evolution is needed of enhanced communication strategies that provide general populations and vulnerable populations most at risk with actionable information for self-protection, including identification of symptoms, and clear guidance for treatment seeking.
Third, continued intensive source control is needed in the epicentre in China—ie, isolation of patients and persons testing positive for COVID-19, contact tracing and health monitoring, strict health facility infection prevention and control, and use of other active public health control interventions with continued active surveillance and containment activities at all other sites where outbreaks are occurring in China.
Fourth, continued containment activities are needed around sites outside China where there are infected people and transmission among contacts, with intensive study to provide information on transmissibility, means of transmission, and natural history of infection, with regular reporting to WHO and sharing of data.
Fifth, intensified active surveillance is needed for possible infections in all countries using the WHO-recommended surveillance case definition.11
Sixth, preparation for resilience of health systems in all countries is needed, as is done at the time of seasonal influenza, anticipating severe infections and course of disease in older people and other populations identified to be at risk of severe disease.
Seventh, if widespread community transmission is established, there should then be consideration of a transition to include mitigation activities, especially if contact tracing becomes ineffective or overwhelming and an inefficient use of resources. Examples of mitigation activities include cancelling public gatherings, school closure, remote working, home isolation, observation of the health of symptomatic individuals supported by telephone or online health consultation, and provision of essential life support such as oxygen supplies, mechanical ventilators and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) equipment.
Eighth, serological tests need to be developed that can estimate current and previous infections in general populations.
Finally, continued research is important to understand the source of the outbreak by study of animals and animal handlers in markets to provide evidence necessary for prevention of future coronavirus outbreaks.

I'll tell you right now. I have 0 confidence in SPCE. I've expressed it many times. It was worth getting into before the IV hike. Jan 2021 calls were dirt cheap in December (when WSB started spamming the sub about SPCE and I was interested). It doesn't have to be much, but if you can set $500-$2k of those $10k, to buy dips on some coronavirus affected stocks, it would not be a bad idea.

Huoshenshan Hospital, a makeshift hospital built in Wuhan amid the novel coronavirus pneumonia (COVID-19) epidemic, Thursday saw its first seven cured patients.

The cured patients walked out of the hospital without assistance on Thursday afternoon and were sent home by vehicles dispatched by the hospital.

Among the recovered was a 66-year-old patient, who bowed to medical workers to express appreciation before leaving.

The hospital has carried out personalized treatment plans, said Zhang Sibing, head of the hospital.

Zhang added that patients can receive comprehensive treatment services including nutritional therapy, psychological counseling and rehabilitation training.

After being built in 10 days in Wuhan, the epicenter of the virus outbreak, the hospital received its first batch of patients on Feb. 4. More than 1,000 patients infected with the novel coronavirus had been admitted to the hospital as of the end of Wednesday.

People exposed to a virus to which no one is immune is not the same every day situation. 

This is why I said...**put them in separate rooms**...this way they don't share air nor expose themselves to each other's secretions. This way, a healthy person won't be exposed to the virus from a sick person. 

**Quarantining means separating the sick from the healthy. It doesn't mean putting them all together.**  

However, since this virus can be transmitted during the incubation period (or at least there is a doubt about it), when there are no symptoms, we have to keep those exposed separated from the general population  until such incubation period ends. Just today or yesterday 1 of those in quarantine in Texas turned symptomatic and is positive for coronavirus  (15th patient in USA).

I'm thinking about an accelerated recombination of strains to produce what is now an extremely infectious human virus.

Several unpublished pre-prints on BioArchive. I believe one or two have been accepted suggesting a late November start date. The first index case was diagnosed on December 8. Knowing what we know about the incubation period, the exposure date would be 2 weeks prior in the third week of November the earliest, first week of December the latest.

> The case numbers reported by the Government are a weak lower bound for the number of actual people; there are many reasons for this. 

There is literally no basis for such a statement. You are purposely confusing the concept of ""confirmed cases"" and ""infected cases"". Published confirmed numbers do not serve as lower bounds, the actual lower bound for ""infected case"" is at least several times higher based on basic epidemiologic principles. Half the sub (not you) still does not understand this key distinction between ""confirmed"" vs ""actual"" cases. All they can do is yam lol, these numbers are so low, actual number 10x higher. No shit, the actual is higher but confirmed will always be lower. Kinda like how NYC has 0 cases and only 7 people under observation.

> It would just record heart attack as cause of death (at least, that is my understanding, correct me if I am wrong). Most other countries would note cause of death as BOTH nCov and heart attack.

This is an unsubstantiated claim. Even in the US, EHR records in terms of death certs are lacking and inaccurate in most cases. There is no standardized way of filling out death certificates and ICD-10 codes vary wildly based on the physicians filling out the certificate (which is a task most do not ever get trained on). Sure, you could argue for malice. Some physicians may be fudging it under pressure from governmental or hospital forces, but there is literally no credible evidence support this claim. Your characterization is basically implies that all such death certs would be wrongly issued in China.

>  The second is that if someone dies while waiting to be confirmed for nCov, or not getting tested for nCov at all, their death would not be reported as a Coronavirus death under the official statistics.

This is false. The new clinical definition is what caused the spike yesterday and is partially what you are describing here.

> Spread was not contained at all inside Wuhan for the first ~8 weeks of the disease.

First, I already pointed out the problem with your 8 week number above. Secondly, Wuhan confirmed cases were quarantined in hospital even in December."

2020-02-13,penthouse413,Anxiety,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/eupik4/coronavirus_megathread/fhizcq6/,"A press conference / briefing took place in Germany today, with four top medics in the field of epidemiology who are at the forefront of current research efforts (and partly involved in the care of the German nCoV patients) with regard to the virus, and I wanted to relay some of the more interesting points in no particular order:

\- What they can say with a high degree of certainty at this point is that **most people infected with the virus will just have a cold**, in terms of severity. **Children appear to be almost not affected at all, and the same appears to apply to pregnant women** (for the latter, this is a welcome difference from the 'ordinary' influenza they say). These are direct quotes.

\- None of the 9 patients in the Munich clinic required any sort of breathing assistance. One patient developed pneumonia, but it was kept under control without problems with antiviral therapy and this patient has improved greatly and his discharge is nearing.

\- Virus patients do tend to be male predominantly, and it affects the elderly more, as we know already.

\- On the topic of asymptomatic transmission, it appears that this doesn't take place per se, however, there is 'oligo-symptomatic' transmission for sure (i.e. with very mild symptoms which could feel like the very early stages of a cold). Essentially, it is an academic discussion at this point as to whether in certain cases the classification should be 'mildly symptomatic' or 'asymptomatic' (the latter because symptoms are just *very* mild.

\- Use of masks in public is being discouraged, firstly because if an actual pandemic were to play out, those would be much more needed in medical settings, and secondly because most masks are rendered useless after around 20 minutes of wearing them simply due to the moisture in the breath.

\- If there was an actual pandemic, specifically for Germany (that's what the question was about) they expect the duration of it to be 'just a few weeks'.

\- PCR testing for the virus is highly sensitive, and even very mildly symptomatic patients should be picked up as 'positive' by the test. In fact, the test is so sensitive that (based on their experience with the 9 Munich patients but also others) in recovering patients cell cultures will start indicating that there is *no more* infectivity at least a week before the PCR test finally returns negative results. Because if this, they are developing strategies now where e.g. cell cultures could be relied upon more as opposed to PCR tests, so that in the case of a wide-spread pandemic, patients who are effectively not infectious anymore can be discharged sooner.

\- Related to that, they referred to the recent rumours that some Chinese patients who have the virus tested falsely negative once of even multiple times (before eventually testing positive). In their opinion, this should basically be impossible given the sensitivity of the PCR test, so they put it down to potential handling errors, or, as one of the physicians stated he overheard during an international task force conference call earlier today, there was actually a misunderstanding this report was based on, and the false negatives happened with a serology test the Chinese have developed/are still refining to allow for faster/more testing.

\- Almost all virus patients outside of China are actually of Chinese descent. Based on this information, coupled with the fact that almost all cases outside of China have been mild, they do not think that the virus is particularly lethal for Chinese (the question about ACE2 receptors and the associated rumoured differences in threat by ethnicity was not asked, just incase anyone is wondering). Instead, they think it shows that the higher case and death numbers in China, and especially in Hubei, are due to this being the epicenter, due to an absolutely overwhelmed medical system, and (especially with regard to the deaths) due to likely many many more infected (absolute death numbers basically being higher vs outside of China, but not necessarily the relative lethality).

\- With regard to the now adjusted way of counting patients, they say that this makes sense, because the original numbers were very obviously unrealistic, and the original daily increase, which was very consistent, was rather down to limited testing ability (e.g. ability to text max. 2000 patient per day results in max. 2000 increase of officially confirmed patients for that day).

\- Current risk in Germany (similarly to many other countries) is seen as ZERO, and this assessment will stand until we see the first clusters emerging that have nothing to do with travel to/from China.

\- The main focus in Germany (and many other countries) at the moment is containment - either to prevent large-scale outbreaks to begin with, or, if this does indeed turn pandemic, to gain some time in order to 'dis-connect' the virus from the normal flu (i.e. to hopefully have the normal flu season mostly come to a close in order to allow for much easier identification of actual coronavirus infections. 

\-----

Overall, the sentiment is that a pandemic outbreak outside of China is certainly seen as a possibility, however, there is no panic, and based on everything we know so far, and the nCoV patients that have been identified and treated outside of China especially (allowing for more realistic assessment of various variables), including the ones in Germany, the outlook is not seen as particularly bleak even in the case of pandemic spread. I watched the entire 70-minute briefing and Q&A session, and I certainly felt re-assured. :)"

Don't assume this is the zombie apocalypse. As far as we know it has a 2% death rate but 80% of cases are mild. 

Don't freak out and horde masks. Get some N95 masks at a hardware store, enough to use one a day for a couple of weeks. That's like 14 per person. Not 500. 

Don't freak out and horde weird kinds of food from some overpriced survival store. Make sure you have 2+ weeks of nonperishable food from your local grocery, stuff that you will use anyway. Cans of soup.  Use it up and rotate through your stock, don't let it expire. Regular disasters like hurricanes or ice storms can prompt the need for this much food, so it isn't a bad idea at all times. 

Don't worry the grid will go down, or you'll need an arsenal of guns, society will collapse, or the zombies will come. None of that is likely. If it does, you've got bigger worries than coronavirus. But it won't. 

Discuss a plan with your family. If there are a lot of cases, plan to isolate your elderly relatives. Make sure they have what they need to ride out isolation. Call them more often. Bring stuff to leave on their porch. 

Get hand sanitizer, 70% alcohol, and get used to using it. Practice washing your hands at every opportunity and not touching your face. Stock up on cold medicine, stuff you'd use anyway if you get the flu. But don't overdo it. 

Don't buy oxygen concentrators, guns, generators, 30 year shelf life food, and that kind of crap. The money you spent would probably be needed for a doctor. Money is one of the most useful things to have in a medical crisis, conserve it. They just submitted a vaccine to the FDA. If it works, you won't need any of that weird stuff a year from now. Good luck selling it. If you buy this crap, you are betting thousands of dollars on the worst-case, least likely scenario. 

TL:DR Use what you buy, buy what you use."

The advice from our health ministry is for the general public who start having any symptoms but have had no travel history nor links to anyone with travel history from China, to seek medical attention at a GP’s clinic first, and should the doctor advise the need to (likely if from listening to the lungs it doesn’t sound good), then the doctor’s clinic/themselves can call for an ambulance to be sent to the ER where they’ll get tested. 

If all examinations by the GP isn’t indicative of something beyond a regular flu, still, if one doesn’t get better after a few days of taking the meds issued by the GP, they can then proceed to any public hospital’s ER to get tested. I know of cases (cos my church has a cluster) who went to get tested (and got diagnosed but are doing well) after having had fevers for several days that didn’t get better with meds. They didn’t display any other symptoms at all.

On top of that, lots of work has been put in doing contact tracing and even roping in the CID to use police investigative methods when contact tracing failed, in order to link up each new infected case with previous cases/travel history, just so we’ll know when it’s at a level where community spread is present, i.e. spreading widely and cannot be traced.

There are no cases of that particular coronavirus in Dallas. Keep in mind, coronavirus as a family and viruses. There are hundreds of varieties, and they are responsible for most cases of the common cold. There are likely thousands if not tense of thousands of coronavirus cases in Dallas right now as we speak, but they are just the common cold variety.

Just follow the normal procedures of washing your hands regularly, and not touching your face or eyes or mouth or other mucous membranes without washing your hands first, and you will be fine. By the way, the Wuhan variety of corona virus is about half the size of the smallest particle size that a standard mask will filter out. Buying and wearing a mask only makes you look silly, it will not prevent you from inhaling the virus should somebody sneeze in your face. The most common way to catch most viruses of this nature is by touching a contaminated surfaces or person, and then rubbing your eyes."

""If you are returning from Hubei, China in the next 14 days, you need to report to public health,"" says Summers.

We also don't know for sure if COVID-19 will follow this same pattern, but it's an educated speculation that we will see infection rates drop off somewhat as spring weather sets in.

The story as I know from local news sources is the the first person hospitalised, had arrived from China in melbourne. Flew from Melbourne to gold coast with symptoms (30th Jan) tested positive apon arival, 4 more ppl have since been confirmed with the last on the 5th Feb. If this virus is so contagious surely a large number of people on that flight would have been infected? The current number of 5 ( all if whom belong to the same tour group and of Chinese national origin) people in my state should be much higher.

Point being how can this be such a super contagious virus?"

There is no respiration going through the goggles to bring in large volumes of outside air, just a small amount of convection current.  I think it would be unlikely that the Coronavirus would infect someone through their eyes if they were wearing a pair of well fitted safety goggles.   If people were regularly being infected through their eyes, EVERYONE in China would have it by now since masks by themselves would be essentially useless.  99% of the photos/videos coming out of China show members of the public wearing masks only.

As the number of coronavirus cases jumps dramatically in China, a top infectious-disease scientist warns that things could get far worse: Two-thirds of the world’s population could catch it.

So says Ira Longini, an adviser to the World Health Organization who tracked studies of the virus’s transmissibility in China. His estimate implies that there could eventually be billions more infections than the current official tally of about 60,000.

If the virus spreads to anywhere near that extent, it will show the limitations of China’s strict containment measures, including quarantining areas inhabited by tens of millions of people. WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus has credited those steps with giving the rest of China and the world a “window” in which to prepare.


Quarantines may slow the spread, but the virus had the opportunity to roam in China and beyond before they went into effect, Longini said. The country boosted its count of those infected by almost 15,000 on Thursday after widening the diagnosis methods.

Longini’s modeling is based on data showing that each infected person normally transmits the disease to two to three other people. A lack of rapid tests and the relative mildness of the infection in some people also makes it difficult to track its spread, he said.


Reducing Transmission


Even if there were a way to reduce transmission by half, that would still imply that roughly one-third of the world would become infected, Longini said.

“Unless the transmissibility changes, surveillance and containment can only work so well,” Longini, co-director of the Center for Statistics and Quantitative Infectious Diseases at the University of Florida, said in an interview at WHO headquarters in Geneva. “Isolating cases and quarantining contacts is not going to stop this virus.”


He’s not alone in warning of the possibility of a far greater spread. Neil Ferguson, a researcher at Imperial College London, estimated that as many as 50,000 people may be infected each day in China. Gabriel Leung, a public health professor at the University of Hong Kong, has also said close to two-thirds of the world could catch the virus if it is left unchecked.

The estimates of spread are part of a spectrum of possibilities that could unfold as the epidemic progresses, said Alessandro Vespignani, a biostatistician at Northeastern University in Boston. The next few weeks may provide more information about how easily the disease spreads outside China, particularly if more measures are put in place to control it, he said.

“People change behaviors” in response to disease, he said. “This is kind of a worst-case scenario. It’s one of the possibilities.”

More data need to be gathered to gain a better idea of how far the virus is likely to range, said David Heymann, an infectious disease expert at at the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine who oversaw the WHO’s response to SARS in 2003. “We’re seeing countries outside of China that have been able to contain the outbreak pretty well.”

I’m not saying they’re wrong,” he said of estimates from the likes of Longini and Leung. “I’m saying the models will be refined as more information comes to light.”"

On the 27th and 28th, three patients were successively admitted, and Zhang Jixian reported again. The hospital attached great importance to reporting immediately.

On December 30, the Wuhan Health and Medical Commission issued a document to investigate and analyze cases of pneumonia of unknown cause, and requested to report it before 4 pm. At 5 pm, some doctors issued a statement in their classmates that “7 cases of SARS have been diagnosed in the South China market”, which was later updated to “Coronavirus, virus typing”, and reminded “Everyone should not spread the word and let family and loved ones pay attention to prevention” .

On December 31, the early morning epidemic prevention staff disinfected the South China market and did not close the market. On the morning of the same day, an expert group of the National Health Commission arrived in Wuhan to carry out related inspection and verification work. On the same day, relevant departments released news through the media, ""At present, the cause is not clear, and it cannot be concluded that it is the SARS virus rumored on the Internet.

I am from China, currently working in Japan. This is my fourth year here. It's amazing that you are able to read Japanese. <3 With the Coronavirus going on now\*, are you okay? It'd be good if it blows over safely\*\*. 

I live with a cat, whose name is Ringo but he's a guy. ""

\*\* 'Safely' might sound weird, but I'm not too sure what other words to replace it. It does mean safe in Japanese though, like when someone's in an accident but nothing happened, and one would go 'I'm glad you're safe/nothing happened to you'. But the virus has been spreading and there has been more deaths, so I wasnt sure what other word to use or how to paraphrase it to make it more accurate to the situation yet also the translation.

Now take those 80k and stick another, let's say 80k or 40k or whatever into the hospital for something else.  Those extra people are staying in the hospital longer since we dont have a treatment protocol.....your system is becoming overburden.  Your normal flu hospital goers are getting less quality of care as a result....more of them will die from the flu.  These guys with coronavirus are also getting less than adequate quality of care...   you could increase capacity, but what's the payoff.  Flu season will taper down in a month or so, opening up capacity....a vaccine expected in a year or so.... so increasing capacity will probably not happen as it's not profitable....

There is some common sense reason to want to slow down the spread.  Same number of people will get it, but over a longer period time....more survivable.

It's been stated on various news sites that if the same thing happened here in the u.s., there would be no lock down.  We'd simply say fuck off....  china is totalitarian and communist.

	A person subsequently diagnosed with coronavirus was at a central London conference attended by more than 200 people last week, it has emerged, as authorities rush to trace those who may have come into contact with the patient.

The unknown individual attended the UK Bus Summit at the QEII Centre, one of London’s largest conference halls, in Westminster on February 6.

Conference organisers Transport Times emailed attenders on Thursday afternoon on the instruction of Public Health England, informing them that a person confirmed to have the virus had been to the conference.

The email enclosed a letter from PHE, a government body. It told delegates to take no action if they were well but to stay indoors, avoid contact with others and call the NHS helpline if they developed symptoms such as a fever or cough.

“While the degree of contact you may have had with the case at the summit is unlikely to have been significant, we are taking a precautionary approach and informing you,” the letter said.

The bus conference listed about 250 delegates from the nationwide bus and transport industry, including several members of parliament and directors of national transport operators.

The catered event took place over one day and included demonstrations of electric buses and discussions on national bus policy. The QEII centre, which has a capacity of more than 2,500 people, hosted another conference, for asset managers, on the same day.

Coronavirus mapped: the latest figures as the outbreak spreads

Citing patient confidentiality, authorities declined to give any further information on the person who had coronavirus, including their other movements in the UK or whether they had travelled from abroad.

But officials indicated that the individual is among the nine patients in England who have already tested positive for coronavirus.

They pointed to a commitment by Chris Whitty, chief medical officer for England, that any new cases in the UK would be publicly announced.

Public Health England is now attempting to trace the contacts of each of those confirmed to have been infected by the virus, by collecting detailed information on a person’s movements before they were diagnosed.

Professor Whitty has previously said it is very unlikely that the virus can be passed on by someone who is not displaying symptoms, but authorities are monitoring the available information to determine whether this is a concern.

A spokesperson for Transport Times said it was “working closely with Public Health England, following their advice closely, and have distributed a letter of guidance from PHE to all attendees”.

On Monday the UK government declared the coronavirus outbreak “a serious and imminent threat to public health”. It has also gone further than many governments in taking new legal powers that mean the health secretary can force people to enter, or remain in, quarantine if they are thought to pose a risk of spreading the disease.

After the World Health Organisation designated the outbreak “a public health emergency of international concern”, the risk to the UK public was raised from “low” to “moderate”, although the government has said the risk to individuals remains low."

Edit: in addition, we know that often low temp can increase the binding affinity for viral ligands to cell receptor proteins.  Thus if a virus gets into you respiratory tract, it is more likely to ""stick"" to its target cell and then infect it.

In fact when cell biologist do endocytosis assays, the often times cool the cells a 4C to allow the ligand to stick better, before they warm them back up to 37C to watch them internalize (aka. endocytose)"

A virus is a little bit of dna wrapped in a protein. A protein is made of atoms which are like little magnets. If you've ever played with magnets toys you can create some cool shapes. These little protein strands fold and create the unique shape of the virus. Our immune system ""learns"" this shape by creating another protein that we call antibody. It has a shape that's kind of opposite of the virus so that it can molecularly bond to the virus causing it to be inert and no longer able to infect. At that point it just becomes a bit of protein floating in your blood or tissue and your body disposed of it like it normally would other materials. 

> In the case of coronavirus, when a patient has managed to successfully recover, what does that mean for the patient?

> Are they no longer carrying the virus?

No. Once the body has fought off the virus it is no longer detectable. 

> Can they still spread the virus? 

It's not yet clear how long a person is contagious. It may be up to 24 days. Once they're fully recovered they're no longer contagious. 

> Are they at risk of contracting the virus again?

Yes. Immunity decreases over time. This is true for all viruses. They could catch the exact same strain a year later. 

> If so, What would happen if they contracted the virus again?

They'd most likely experience milder symptoms. 

> If the virus mutates and they come into contact are they still at risk?

Yes. In that case the previous antibodies would offer no immunity. The body would need to relearn the virus protein shape and create new antibodies. 


> If their body can now recognise the virus, does that mean they will no longer experience symptoms if the virus enters their system again?

Possibly. Either no symptoms or mild symptoms. 

> Would they now be susceptible to another serious virus or infection considering what their immune system just went through?

No. The body is exposed to thousands of pathogens a day. The only issue would be permanent damage to the lungs heart or kidneys. 

> Would someone who has contracted coronavirus have any permanent health issues after recovery?

The lungs are most at risk for permanent injury.

Until we create a vaccine the treatment plan is to keep the patient alive until their body makes enough antibodies to fight off the disease. That includes analgesics, oxygen and breathing treatments."

By John Lauerman

As the number of coronavirus cases jumps dramatically in China, a top infectious-disease scientist warns that things could get far worse: Two-thirds of the world’s population could catch it.

So says Ira Longini, an adviser to the World Health Organization who tracked studies of the virus’s transmissibility in China. His estimate implies that there could eventually be billions more infections than the current official tally of about 60,000.

If the virus spreads to anywhere near that extent, it will show the limitations of China’s strict containment measures, including quarantining areas inhabited by tens of millions of people. WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus has credited those steps with giving the rest of China and the world a “window” in which to prepare.

Quarantines may slow the spread, but the virus had the opportunity to roam in China and beyond before they went into effect, Longini said. The country boosted its count of those infected by almost 15,000 on Thursday after widening the diagnosis methods.

Longini’s modeling is based on data showing that each infected person normally transmits the disease to two to three other people. A lack of rapid tests and the relative mildness of the infection in some people also makes it difficult to track its spread, he said.

Reducing Transmission
Even if there were a way to reduce transmission by half, that would still imply that roughly one-third of the world would become infected, Longini said.

“Unless the transmissibility changes, surveillance and containment can only work so well,” Longini, co-director of the Center for Statistics and Quantitative Infectious Diseases at the University of Florida, said in an interview at WHO headquarters in Geneva. “Isolating cases and quarantining contacts is not going to stop this virus.”

He’s not alone in warning of the possibility of a far greater spread. Neil Ferguson, a researcher at Imperial College London, estimated that as many as 50,000 people may be infected each day in China. Gabriel Leung, a public health professor at the University of Hong Kong, has also said close to two-thirds of the world could catch the virus if it is left unchecked.

The estimates of spread are part of a spectrum of possibilities that could unfold as the epidemic progresses, said Alessandro Vespignani, a biostatistician at Northeastern University in Boston. The next few weeks may provide more information about how easily the disease spreads outside China, particularly if more measures are put in place to control it, he said.

“People change behaviors” in response to disease, he said. “This is kind of a worst-case scenario. It’s one of the possibilities.”

More data need to be gathered to gain a better idea of how far the virus is likely to range, said David Heymann, an infectious disease expert at the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine who oversaw the WHO’s response to SARS in 2003. “We’re seeing countries outside of China that have been able to contain the outbreak pretty well.”

“I’m not saying they’re wrong,” he said of estimates from the likes of Longini and Leung. “I’m saying the models will be refined as more information comes to light.”

This is a good overview resource, and you can read the general overview of protocol.

Short summary, PCR tests are pain in the ass and rely on a level of sound laboratory quality control protocol to run well.

https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/technical-guidance/laboratory-guidance

30-50% is on the low end, it means China seems to have recognized by using mass testing and with the related stressors, the testing protocols are getting very sloppy, this is not a typical accuracy rate for a PCR test with perfect execution.  The human factor does mean you have possible mistakes, but I wonder if the Chinese are even reviewing laboratory logs to check and verify what was the source of the initial mistakes when they inevitably arise, my guess the Chinese just decides to order another test and maybe get another more seasoned laboratory to run the test.

Does China really have that many labs(100) in one province alone that can perform the test, it requires bio safety 2 since the clinical sample can be a vector for the disease to spread and you need protocols in place to prevent such possibilities and to avoid cross contamination to get a lab error, I guess it is possible with all hands on deck deep in Hubei."

**How many people die from coronavirus?**

* Currently, about 2% of people confirmed infected with coronavirus die.  


* The regular flu kills about 0.1% of people infected with it.  


* The SARS outbreak in 2003 killed almost 10% of people infected with it. 

**Are surgical masks effective against coronavirus?**

* Masks are more beneficial for people already infected with coronavirus to stop the spread of germs.  

  

* If you are not infected, masks *help* but do not fully prevent the transmission of the virus. Part of this is because of improper use - e.g., someone wears a mask to protect themselves but then scratches their nose. **The WHO recommends washing your hands as one of the best prevention methods**. Wash your hands after you sneeze, after you wipe your nose, after going to the bathroom, and before eating."

When I say low severity, I am referring to the percentage of people that experience severe complications or death.

Addendum: We don't know anything about this virus, mistakes will be done. For example...it seems now the incubation period can be as long as 24 days...we didn't know that 2 days ago.

\-There have been reports out of China that the recovered my still be re-infected. However there is no scientific evidence to prove this, and some experts doubt it (bear it mind they doubted other things that turned out to be true).

\-It's currently been assumed that once you test negative, you are no longer contagious. However there have been reports of people testing negative, then sometime later testing positive again (again, they are unclear whether the person was re-infected, or just *still* infected and the virus had increased it's load again)

\-If you could and did get reinfected, nobody knows what would happen because there are no studies of this happening. Any answer anyone can give you is pure speculation.

\-Yes, if the virus mutates enough, it would be possible to be reinfected (same with our common flu's)

\-When your immune system is lowered or overloaded fighting something you are always more at risk of other infections. This is the case with everything and is not specific for this virus. This is what people mean by 'immune compromised' and it's also the reason you will hear people warning that these types of people are more at risk of coronavirus.

\-There are no long term studies of Coronavirus patients to be sure of long term health effects. But from what we know of people who experienced severe pneumonia and ARDS for other reasons, it's common for them to suffer ongoing health issues."

Commissaries do not stock merchandise well. It is frustrating. But as a military wife of 25+ years, I accept the reality that no government run stores can be operated like commercial ones.

More than ten years ago, we could not get chicken for a looooong time in the meat section. Only frozen chicken was available. I forgot where we were stationed. But it was somewhere in the CONUS. So I went off base to buy.

Rice is the same way. Sometimes the shelf is full. Other times certain brand is low in stock and takes some time to get restocked. 

Several years ago, I could not find craisins original for weeks! My DH needs it for salad. I ended up going off base to get bags and bags LOL.

I currently live in the capital region. I checked hand sanitizers last Monday and Friday at Commissary. They were in stock on both days. Bought one big bottle on Friday. Saw many small and medium size bottles fully in stock.

Hope Coronavirus does not spread all over the military bases. To be honest, I am a bit nervous about  accommodating evacuees from Wuhan on military installations."

1. SHe 'reported her symptoms' which means she was symptomatic (COUGHING AND SNEEZING)
2. ONE cough or sneeze in a closed car is enough to infect the entire car - just because SHE GOT OUT in 15 minutes does not mean the virus that she sprayed all over the inside of that car LEFT WITH HER.
3. Time to die varies from strain to strain but MOST are just **fine** for anywhere from several hours up to a few DAYS at ROOM TEMP. (approx 60-70F)
4. I'm not aware of any CLOCK based TRAFFIC COP that governs viruses that is the GATEKEEPER to the human body. It's not like there is a dialogue like this:

The apparent curious part is:  

* The confirmed doctor took away from work since Feb. 06 ([Source](https://www3.nhk.or.jp/nhkworld/en/news/20200214_02/)): 'The officials say the doctor was seeing patients during his usual shifts from February 3 through February 5. But he took leave to rest at home from February 6'.
* The new confirmed first came to the hospital where the doctor worked between Feb. 03 and Feb. 05 first on Feb. 06, and he had already got severe fever ([Source: Only in Japanese](https://www3.nhk.or.jp/news/html/20200214/k10012285021000.html?): 'Wakayama pref. and other authorities report that this male confirmed had got fever and so on and had hospitalized in another hospitals, but he got worse and moved into Saisei Kai Arita Hospital, so the prefecture investigates his case'.  
* (Added:) It is worth noting that the new confirmed had already got severe fever: If it was not by coronavirus, did he also infected from the doctor with symptom, like the diseased positive dead (then only sick) woman got the virus from her son-in-law taxi driver? It suggests that we must be very careful of the infection incurred while hospitalized since these stories share many details.  

It means that these two confirmed apparently have not got contact with each other at least in person if all of these information is correct (i.e. [the breaking news of Mainichi in English](https://mainichi.jp/english/articles/20200214/p2g/00m/0na/044000c), stating 'after contact with the doctor') is not accurate). It can also means that the tracking ability of Japanese authorities is indeed so poor."

I haven’t mentioned the coronavirus yet since thus far it hasn’t hit the US particularly hard (as far as we know) yet. I AM making a point to require more hand washing & sneezing/cough etiquette generally. 

I’ve also started teaching her how to wash her hands more thoroughly like a surgeon (there is a specific technique). However, it’ll take awhile before she gets the hang of it & I haven’t come down too hard to FORCE the issue because the cost of alienating her right now outweighs the relatively low risk of her contracting it.  If/when our geography starts to see multiple cases & a true outbreak statewide seems imminent, I’ll probably change my tone on that & sit her down & explain the pandemic situation in a literal “EILI5” type of way in the hopes that the seriousness sinks in & she “buys into” the better hand/cough hygiene protocols."

From what we know so far, older patients make up the majority of severe cases and deaths. On the Princess ship docked in Tokyo, pretty much all infected and hospitalized were >49 years of age. Today we learned Japan had its first coronavirus death, an 80 year old Japanese woman. The British man who caught in in Singapore, spread it in the French alps and later after returning to Britain, has fully recovered. He was under 50, if I'm not mistaken. 

If we really do see an infection rate anywhere near 2/3 of the world's population, it's a good bet that a pretty hefty number of baby boomers will become fatality statistics. 

What if 1/2 the boomers were wiped out? That's a huge voting block and a lot of open positions for younger generations in the workforce (families and homeownership  becoming more affordable?) It could also take a huge burden off of social security and medicare."

In epidemiology, the basic reproduction number (sometimes called basic reproductive ratio, or incorrectly basic reproductive rate, and denoted R0, pronounced R nought or R zero) of an infection can be thought of as the expected number of cases directly generated by one case in a population where all individuals are susceptible to infection. The definition describes the state where no other individuals are infected or immunized (naturally or through vaccination). Some definitions, such as that of the Australian Department of Health, add absence of ""any deliberate intervention in disease transmission"". The basic reproduction number is not to be confused with the effective reproduction number R which is the number of cases generated in the current state of a population, which does not have to be the uninfected state.

How I understand the WHO strategy is that we are trying to slow down the spread and get time to develop the vaccine/treatment, get time to prepare and wait for warmer months.

So PCR is like this: NCOV sequence is ABCDEF and so you add a primer for ABCDEF. Regular coronavirus has a sequence in that area of HIJKLM and do the primer will only stick to the nCov sequnence, amplify, and the line will show up like you see on Wikipedia. If it's negative for nCov then there will be no line because the primer never bound to anything and so nothing was ever amplified."

The main issue we learned from SARS was that our hospital protocols were HORRIBLE.  Our Hospitals in 2003 were just not equipped to deal with SARS and its impact on our health system.  

[One of the biggest difference between 2003 and now is that our hospital implemented SARS protocols and beyond almost immediately](https://www.ctvnews.ca/health/then-and-now-the-huge-differences-between-sars-and-wuhan-coronavirus-1.4777400)

> Ontario’s Chief Medical Officer Dr. David Williams said hospitals are already employing protocols established during the 2003 SARS outbreak in anticipation of any Canadian cases.

They've already determined, and it's fairly self-evident from reading the thousands of cases in China, that the virus isn't easily transmitted in hospitals -- indicating that aerosolized transmission is not a consistent characteristics of the virus.

> The second key difference that is reassuring health care experts is that the coronavirus doesn’t appear to be easily transmitted from person-to-person. But the case is developing day-by-day, said McGeer.

[Secondly, our health-care system is also relying on third parties to help identify potential victims / carrier risks.](https://www.ctvnews.ca/health/how-a-canadian-company-spotted-the-coronavirus-outbreak-before-health-officials-1.4802942)  

> Toronto-based BlueDot uses AI to scour more than 100,000 articles every day in 65 languages looking for news about more than 150 different diseases. Around 10 a.m. EST on Dec. 31, their system spotted an article in Chinese about a “pneumonia of unknown cause” with 27 cases.

I'm trying to find another source to show that the province (or maybe the Federal government), has already started using this kind of computational intelligence to identify issues within their borders.  There was an article a week or so ago regarding this topic.  I will continue to try and find it.  

[Even from 2015, CBC highlights three key areas Canada has improved upon when it comes to highly contagious and dangerous viruses](https://www.cbc.ca/news/health/mers-outbreak-3-lessons-canada-learned-from-sars-1.3109550).

* Knowledge is power
* Have protocols for front-line workers
* Clear, timely communication is key

[They've identify communication breakdowns from the SARS timeline, and are already *closing the loop*](https://www.canada.ca/content/dam/phac-aspc/migration/phac-aspc/publicat/sars-sras/pdf/sars-e.pdf).

Although Health Canada regularly transmitted information
to WHO during the SARS outbreak, it was unable to
supply as much detail as was formally requested. The
absence of formal reporting processes between municipal,
provincial, and federal governments contributed greatly
to deficiencies in data acquisition and sharing. 

We also have a Quarantine Act embedded into our legislation that gives authority to port officers to remove any person or persons who might be showing characteristics similar to previous viruses.  There's no doubt they've been highlighting the COVID-19 virus as an important area of documentation and execution of protocol.  

> The Quarantine Act and Regulations give
quarantine officers at Canadian ports of entry and exit the
authority to require that a person suspected of having a
disease listed in the Act or another dangerous disease
undergo a medical examination and to detain that person
if necessary. The Act lists four contagious diseases:
cholera, plague, yellow fever and smallpox. In keeping
with WHO’s urging that member nations take the
necessary steps to address the SARS outbreak, Health
Canada has amended the Quarantine Act Regulations.
The amendments include adding SARS to the Quarantine
Act’s Schedule of infectious and contagious diseases;
prescribing an incubation period for SARS (20 days).

[But Canada has already done some of the above by hosting the rescued citizens in AFB Trenton.](https://www.thestar.com/news/gta/2020/02/05/do-quarantines-work-lessons-from-sars-challenge-canadas-coronavirus-response.html)

> Yet the Canadian government is planning to enforce a two-week quarantine at a Canadian Forces Base in Trenton for the 211 apparently healthy people being evacuated Friday from the epicentre of the outbreak in Wuhan, China. 

Canada is already identifying issues with public perception, which suggests they are very aware of the port and airport risks involved with citizens or visitors arriving from Wuhan.  

> Infection control experts say there is no health-based reason to justify Ottawa’s quarantine measures. The decision is more likely a political response to a different epidemic: the spread of fear and anxiety.

> “Quarantining on the base for 14 days, it’s all optics — it’s all, what do Canadians want to see, and what have other countries done,” says Alon Vaisman, an infection control physician at University Health Network.

> Travellers from Wuhan with no symptoms could readily monitor themselves at home, “but the public probably won’t tolerate that.”

When we just remove the fear, it's fairly self-evident that the government and health sector are very much on top of things.  Every single public medical facility has already posted signs about the virus and have placed sanitizer / masks at the front for potential carriers.  This is a substantial change from 2003."

Such a dumb name for it. Even the etymology of it is dumb.

There are numerous factors already extant that could cause collapse in various parts of the world. Coronavirus is among them.

Why you think we have that long I don't know. I suspect like most people it's a failure to accept the scope and severity of what's happening.

Tests so far suggest that the coronavirus is relatively stable but as it is passed from human to human the virus will become more adapted as a human disease. This is not necessarily a bad thing, though. “In Darwinian terms, the virus wants to survive,” said Smith. “And to do that it’s generally not a sensible idea for a virus to kill people. The most successful viruses infect a lot of people and cause relatively little pathology.”

It’s worth noting that coronaviruses do not undergo the same type of genome shuffling that leads to the constantly shifting variety of flu strains in circulation. It is this genetic drift that means new flu vaccines have to be created each year and that means getting the flu once does not mean you’ll be immune next time it comes around. The coronavirus is not expected to mutate this rapidly and so once a vaccine is here, it should continue to work far into the future.

When will a vaccine be ready?

Teams around the world are [racing to produce a vaccine](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/feb/01/researchers-make-strides-in-race-to-create-coronavirus-vaccine), with some vaccine candidates already being tested in animals, just weeks after the coronavirus DNA sequence was released. Jeff Richardson of Inovio Pharmaceuticals, one of the teams backed by funding from the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (Cepi), said the team’s DNA-based vaccine is already being manufactured on a larger scale for human testing projected to start early summer. A team from the University of Queensland, also backed by Cepi, is already testing its vaccine in combination with a technology developed by GSK, which makes the immune system respond more strongly to vaccines, potentially lowering the dose required by a factor of four.

Few people doubt that a viable vaccine will be in human testing by the summer. But these incremental trials, in which the numbers given the vaccine are ramped up from 20 to 200 and then thousands, will unavoidably take many months to ensure that the vaccine is safe and that even rare side-effects are spotted. A commercially available vaccine within a year would be quick.

Person with confirmed coronavirus was at Westminster conference

Organisers contacting everyone who attended transport summit in central London venue

A person subsequently diagnosed with [coronavirus](https://archive.ph/o/rTZpR/https://www.ft.com/content/a8190d19-137b-39fb-aa5e-f5b55b2d9ce2) was at a central London conference attended by more than 200 people last week, it has emerged, as authorities rush to trace those who may have come into contact with the patient.

The unknown individual attended the UK Bus Summit at the QEII Centre, one of London’s largest conference halls, in Westminster on February 6.

Conference organisers Transport Times emailed attenders on Thursday afternoon on the instruction of Public Health England, informing them that a person confirmed to have the virus had been to the conference.

The email enclosed a letter from PHE, a government body. It told delegates to take no action if they were well but to stay indoors, avoid contact with others and call the NHS helpline if they developed symptoms such as a fever or cough.

“While the degree of contact you may have had with the case at the summit is unlikely to have been significant, we are taking a precautionary approach and informing you,” the letter said.

The bus conference listed about 250 delegates from the nationwide bus and transport industry, including several members of parliament and directors of national transport operators.

The catered event took place over one day and included demonstrations of electric buses and discussions on national bus policy. The QEII centre, which has a capacity of more than 2,500 people, hosted another conference, for asset managers, on the same day.

Citing patient confidentiality, authorities declined to give any further information on the person who had coronavirus, including their other movements in the UK or whether they had travelled from abroad.

But officials indicated that the individual is among the [nine patients in England](https://archive.ph/o/rTZpR/https://www.ft.com/content/63a4eaaa-4dce-11ea-95a0-43d18ec715f5) who have already tested positive for coronavirus.

They pointed to a commitment by Chris Whitty, chief medical officer for England, that any new cases in the UK would be publicly announced.

Public Health England is now attempting to trace the contacts of each of those confirmed to have been infected by the virus, by collecting detailed information on a person’s movements before they were diagnosed.

Professor Whitty has previously said it is very unlikely that the virus can be passed on by someone who is not displaying symptoms, but authorities are monitoring the available information to determine whether this is a concern.

A spokesperson for Transport Times said it was “working closely with Public Health England, following their advice closely, and have distributed a letter of guidance from PHE to all attendees”.

On Monday the UK government declared the coronavirus outbreak “a serious and imminent threat to public health”. It has also gone further than many governments in taking new legal powers that mean the health secretary can force people to enter, or remain in, quarantine if they are thought to pose a risk of spreading the disease.

After the World Health Organisation designated the outbreak “a public health emergency of international concern”, the risk to the UK public was raised from “low” to “moderate”, although the government has said the risk to individuals remains low."

First, Michele's doctors should rule out other more likely causes (like Influenza).  A CT scan is also a good way to check for likely Coronavirus.  If it's not flu and the CT scan looks like Coronavirus, then the CDC should test.  But the CDC guidelines don't allow testing even in that case - they require e.g. exposure.  (Just today they changed the rules in a few cities, but testing is still highly limited.)  Countries like Singapore and Japan are testing more aggressively, even without exposure, and they are finding cases - the CDC should be doing more testing, otherwise we won't know who has this."

> 5 Demystifying panic buying

> Singapore’s dense, close-knit networks make people more prone to believe their contacts and take up mass behaviours, like buying toilet paper for no apparent reason, just because your WhatsApp chatmates are doing so

> Why did so many Singaporeans rush out to hoard toilet paper when the Disease Outbreak Response System Condition alert was raised to “orange”? Professors Roland Bouffanais and Lim Sun Sun unravel this mystery by explaining how clusters of close-knit networks work to perpetuate information.

> Last Friday, just as supermarket shelves began being emptied of rice, instant noodles and toilet paper, our social media accounts started filling up with images of trolleys heaped with those very items. These displays of panic buying soon dominated social media chatter on closed platforms, such as WhatsApp chat groups, as well as more open platforms such as Twitter and Facebook. Photographs of long lines of shoppers paying for mountains of products went viral quickly, along with memes and jokes ridiculing the selfish hoarding behaviour.

> What was to account for this descent into seemingly senseless and frantic purchasing? News reports suggest that a collective buying frenzy seemed to seize people across the island after the coronavirus alert level was raised to Disease Outbreak Response System Condition (Dorscon) orange. But was that the only trigger?

> Disaster sociologists investigate human behaviour in response to extreme events such as natural catastrophes, mass power outages and terrorist attacks. They observe that there is a natural human instinct to prepare for rare contingencies by buying supplies, contacting loved ones and developing emergency plans. Panic buying is thus not unprecedented and has occurred in response to numerous disasters, both real and perceived.

> During the 1962 Cuban missile crisis, Americans ran to grocery stores and stocked up on bread and milk after then United States President John F. Kennedy announced the Soviets’ entry into Cuba. In the wake of the 2011 Tohoku earthquake in Japan, consumption of daily necessities surged, with households hoarding rice, bread and noodles. Panic buying thus seems to be a natural coping mechanism in the face of grave uncertainty.

> However, this begs the question as to why the elevation to Dorscon orange was perceived by so many to be such an imminent and harrowing threat as to require a supermarket sweep.

> The answer lies perhaps in a social contagion that seems more lethal than the viral pathogen we are currently battling – the spread of misinformation.

> Throughout Friday, there was rampant spreading of fake news reports about the upcoming closure of Singapore schools on Monday. What was later revealed to be a premature leak of a government press release on the impending upgrade to Dorscon orange also raised anxiety levels as it was also quickly shared on social media.

> Crucially, too, these local developments closely followed news reports emerging from Hong Kong of shortages of toilet paper and other necessities as early as four days prior.

> Concurrently, panic buying of toilet paper had occurred in Taiwan, apparently triggered by falsehoods about raw materials typically used to manufacture toilet paper being diverted to make surgical masks.

> Of course, the broader backdrop of the ongoing coronavirus crisis is the extreme containment strategy being undertaken in China, with Singaporeans having been able to observe via mainstream and social media what has been happening in Wuhan during the lockdown.

> Many Singaporeans might have equated the elevation to Dorscon orange with signalling an imminent

> Interestingly, social epidemiology reveals that misinformation spreads most rapidly through dense neighbourhood networks and cohesive social settings. Pressure from a critical number of contacts in one’s social networks... can create a form of social “momentum” that prompts action.

> lockdown of Singapore and were therefore galvanised into panic buying.

> Clearly, in a globalised world, our understanding of local situations is enriched but also complicated by perspectives extending far beyond our immediate environments.

> As media consumers, we must contend not only with domestic information flows, but also manage the onslaught of international news, quite apart from having to discern between legitimate news and false rumours. In such a fraught media landscape, disinformation, rumours, untruths and misinformation can become virulent social contagions that trigger mob mentality and herd behaviour such as the panic buying we witnessed.

> From the scientific perspective, a more productive line of pursuit is not the anecdotal nature or origin of specific rumours, but how social contagions emerge and spread within social networks to overcome our common sense.

> The smartphone and Big Data revolutions of the past decade have enabled social scientists to gain insight into the intricate mechanisms underlying the spread of social contagions.

> Social networks, online and face-to-face, are key to the spread of collective behaviours, including social norms and innovation diffusion.

> Collective behaviours among humans are remarkably similar to processes in the animal kingdom such as schooling among fish and flocking among birds. Like these collective animal behaviours, the propagation of collective human behaviours such as fads and mobs arises from complex repeated interactions among individuals.

> Recent large-scale studies of social networks provide two important insights.

> First, the structure of online social networks can accelerate and amplify the process of social influence when there is considerable overlap in our social networks. In other words, when your different networks of friends are also friends with one another.

> Second, the channels for the spread of social contagions are distinctly different from those of viral contagions. Notably, viral contagions from an infectious disease are said to be simple contagious processes as they can be transmitted from a single contact.

> By contrast, social norms and social movements are complex contagious processes involving contact with multiple sources of virulence. For instance, if tomorrow a majority of the MRT ridership wear masks, it is expected that the minority will feel compelled to start donning them too.

> Interestingly, social epidemiology reveals that misinformation spreads most rapidly through dense neighbourhood networks and cohesive social settings. Pressure from a critical number of contacts in one’s social networks – these may not be direct contacts but friends of friends – can create a form of social “momentum” that prompts action. For example, WhatsApp messages from multiple friends about toilet paper hoarding can snowball into a desperate need to buy toilet paper for no apparent reason.

> People are also known to be more trusting of information shared by one’s immediate social network and further let down their guard against possible misinformation.

> Overlapping social networks of strong ties, connected via social media platforms, are thus highly efficient pathways for social contagions to spread across large and diverse populations.

> The panic buying observed in Singapore, Hong Kong and Taiwan last week demonstrates the complex spread of a social contagion in a hyper-connected and globalised world.

> Our online social networks extend from Singapore to the broader Asian region and beyond. Fear of a toilet paper crunch in Hong Kong and Taiwan percolated to Singapore, where the highly overlapping nature of local social networks made it propagate like a wildfire. Little wonder then that official assurances about the adequacy of supplies took a while to sink in.

The virus that originated in Wuhan is a Coronavirus, designated 2019-nCoV which when infecting a host is designated COVID-19

It is not the *ONLY* Coronavirus.  MERS and SARS were also Coronavirus types, which you may have heard of.  But the far far more common instances of Coronavirus are about equivalent of the common cold.

It's entirely possible that what happened was that the lab developed a vaccine for *A* coronavirus, but not the one everyone cares about right now, and the local news was too dumb to realize the difference."

There are some people suggesting that the R-value of Covid-19 should go down because after the winter season. The minimum time it takes to show symptoms for Covid-19 is 2 days; some say 24 days. And it spreads throughout that entire incubation period. So you can easily pass it on without knowing that you have it.

Contrast that with Influenza:

[""Symptoms can begin about 2 days (but can range from 1 to 4 days)  after the virus enters the body. That means that you may be able to pass on the flu to someone else before you know you are sick, as well as while you are sick. Some people can be infected with the flu virus but have no symptoms. During this time, those people may still spread the virus to others.""](https://www.cdc.gov/flu/about/disease/spread.htm)

1-4 days VS 2-24 days. Which will be more likely to spread?

[The median incubation days for Covid-19 is 5.2 days and the mean incubation of Influenza is 2 days. ](https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/coronavirus-incubation-period/)

That's more than double the incubation time and suggests that the R-values for Covid-19 should go higher rather than lower."

Scientifically speaking, there is little to no value in naming diseases after their area of origin unless you're just looking to blame a specific group of people for the disease. Which is ridiculous, and leads to nonsense conclusions like ""Spanish flu originated in Spain.""

Spanish flu most likely originated in a military medical camp in France, for the record. And the first known cases of ebola were in South Sudan; The second outbreak occurred in what is now known as the Democratic Republic of Republic of the Congo but was then known as Zaire.

So you provided three examples to back up your ridiculous assertion, then proved the ridiculousness of your assertion by getting two of those examples wrong. Good job."

He's allowed to do that as there is no protection around scheduling, regardless of time employed. The same goes for the amount of notice.

What I would do is have a conversation with him and see if he foresees business picking up, the coronavirus isn't going to be around forever, and talk about a plan for action. In the meantime, I'd look for a second job to make up the hours. 

Why stir up shit when it probably doesn't need to be? This is unfortunate, but completely legal. Trying to get laid off probably won't do much either because it could take 6+ weeks to even start collecting EI. Its possible business could resume again by then. 

&#x200B;

My best advice as someone who works with workers in these kinds of scenarios on a daily basis is to just sit down and have a conversation with them first. Look for a second job to make up the lost income, or unless you're thinking of quitting. Chances are they won't fire you because they will have to pay you out.

If you don't mind my asking, have you been there over 5 years, or coming up on your 5 years. And also, is it a large company (payroll of over 2.5 million)? Because severance and termination packages are different..

 If the conversation of a temporary lay off does come up, weigh the pros and cons depending on how long they're thinking the lay off might last. Make sure any documentation given or signed off on states what was discussed! Make sure, if they do agree to a temp layoff, that it says that. They have 13 weeks to give you your position back before it becomes a permanent lay off."

All revolves around money-who has it, who qualifies for medicaid, who falls between the cracks to get assistance. Medicare does not pay for at home personal care (bathing, dressing, etc) which is what most people need. That is part of Pete's platform on national service. Should be lots of data available.

Lots of stats on mandated vaccinations and public health, but not sure how interesting that would be for 15 pages. 

Could also look into the effect of a pandemic/epidemic on the economy. That is, like what it happening in China. Should be a lot of data on previous flu outbreaks. Combined with cost of taking care of people who get really sick from the flu and did not get a flu shot. We are ripe for a pandemic - coronavirus spread is pretty scary.

I would say since it is 2 months and 15 pages, do it about something that really interests you. Lots to choose from. I used to do public health and home care with seniors, so I always veer towards that.

Also, I have dogs and have an interest in diseases transmitted from animals to humans, called zoonoses, or zoonotic diseases, which can be insect born as well as other things, about 200 diseases. There is a lot of information about that as well. Just saw an article on the growing veterinary medical diagnostics field because of this. Interesting abstract here: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25052324 on economic impact of Rift Valley Fever outbreak, a virus that spreads from livestock to humans, often through mosquitoes. This is agricultural as well as human health economics.

EDIT: PBS News Hour has a segment tonight on measles outbreak in Samoa - deaths, not enough vaccines (31% vaccinated) - schools closed, etc. You could definitely get into anti-vaxxers - World health issues. 110,000 deaths in 2017 to 140,000 in 2019; measles has double in Europe. So yeah, lack of measles vaccination is a huge issue."

COVID-19 replicates efficiently in the upper respiratory tract and appears to cause less abrupt onset of symptoms, similar to conventional human coronaviruses that are a major cause of common colds in the winter season.

8

 Infected individuals produce a large quantity of virus in the upper respiratory tract during a prodrome period, are mobile, and carry on usual activities, contributing to the spread of infection. By contrast, transmission of SARS-CoV did not readily occur during the prodromal period when those infected were mildly ill, and most transmission is thought to have occurred when infected individuals presented with severe illness, thus possibly making it easier to contain the outbreaks SARS-CoV caused, unlike the current outbreaks with COVID-19.

6

COVID-19 also has affinity for cells in the lower respiratory tract and can replicate there, causing radiological evidence of lower respiratory tract lesions in patients who do not present with clinical pneumonia.

8

 There seem to be three major patterns of the clinical course of infection: mild illness with upper respiratory tract presenting symptoms; non-life-threatening pneumonia; and severe pneumonia with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) that begins with mild symptoms for 7–8 days and then progresses to rapid deterioration and ARDS requiring advanced life support (WHO EDCARN clinical telephone conference on COVID-19, personal communication with Myoung-don Oh [Seoul National University Hospital] and Yinzhong Shen [Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center])

The case fatality ratio with COVID-19 has been difficult to estimate. The initial case definition in China included pneumonia but was recently adjusted to include people with milder clinical presentation and the current estimate is thought to be about 1–2%, which is lower than that for SARS (10%).

9

 The actual case fatality ratio of infection with COVID-19 will eventually be based on all clinical illness and at the time of writing information on subclinical infection is not available and awaits the development of serological tests and serosurveys.

Presently COVID-19 seems to spread from person to person by the same mechanism as other common cold or influenza viruses—ie, face to face contact with a sneeze or cough, or from contact with secretions of people who are infected. The role of faecal–oral transmission is yet to be determined in COVID-19 but was found to occur during the SARS outbreak.

10

The lock-down of Wuhan City seems to have slowed international spread of COVID-19; however, the effect is expected to be short-lived (WHO modelling group). Efforts are currently underway in China, in the 24 countries to which infected persons have travelled, and in public conveyances, such as cruise ships, to interrupt transmission of all existing and potential chains of transmission, with elimination of COVID-19 in human populations as the final goal. This WHO-recommended strategy is regularly assessed each week by STAG-IH on the basis of daily risk assessments by WHO as information becomes available from outbreak sites.

A plausible scenario based on the available evidence now is that the newly identified COVID-19 is causing, like seasonal influenza, mild and self-limiting disease in most people who are infected, with severe disease more likely among older people or those with comorbidities, such as diabetes, pulmonary disease, and other chronic conditions. Health workers and carers are at high risk of infection, and health-care-associated amplification of transmission is of concern as is always the case for emerging infections. People in long-term care facilities are also at risk of severe health consequences if they become infected.

Non-pharmaceutical interventions remain central for management of COVID-19 because there are no licensed vaccines or coronavirus antivirals. If the situation changes towards much wider community transmission with multiple international foci, the WHO strategy of containment for elimination could need to be adjusted to include mitigation strategies combined with the following activities currently recommended by STAG-IH on the WHO website.

First, close monitoring is needed of changes in epidemiology and of the effectiveness of public health strategies and their social acceptance.

Second, continued evolution is needed of enhanced communication strategies that provide general populations and vulnerable populations most at risk with actionable information for self-protection, including identification of symptoms, and clear guidance for treatment seeking.

Third, continued intensive source control is needed in the epicentre in China—ie, isolation of patients and persons testing positive for COVID-19, contact tracing and health monitoring, strict health facility infection prevention and control, and use of other active public health control interventions with continued active surveillance and containment activities at all other sites where outbreaks are occurring in China.

Fourth, continued containment activities are needed around sites outside China where there are infected people and transmission among contacts, with intensive study to provide information on transmissibility, means of transmission, and natural history of infection, with regular reporting to WHO and sharing of data.

Fifth, intensified active surveillance is needed for possible infections in all countries using the WHO-recommended surveillance case definition.

11

Sixth, preparation for resilience of health systems in all countries is needed, as is done at the time of seasonal influenza, anticipating severe infections and course of disease in older people and other populations identified to be at risk of severe disease.

Seventh, if widespread community transmission is established, there should then be consideration of a transition to include mitigation activities, especially if contact tracing becomes ineffective or overwhelming and an inefficient use of resources. Examples of mitigation activities include cancelling public gatherings, school closure, remote working, home isolation, observation of the health of symptomatic individuals supported by telephone or online health consultation, and provision of essential life support such as oxygen supplies, mechanical ventilators and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) equipment.

Eighth, serological tests need to be developed that can estimate current and previous infections in general populations.

Finally, continued research is important to understand the source of the outbreak by study of animals and animal handlers in markets to provide evidence necessary for prevention of future coronavirus outbreaks.

Officials with Quinte Health Care say someone has been brought to Belleville General Hospital from CFB Trenton today to receive care.

QHC’s Catherine Walker tells Quinte News the patient was brought by EMS and while the assessment is in the early stages, she confirmed that “there are no symptoms that would indicate the coronavirus COVID-19”.

Walker noted that QHC hospitals are equipped to care for anyone who might need to be isolated and that staff re prepared to care for any of the quarantined individuals who might need hospital-level care for any potential health issues.

There was no confirmation as to if the patient was, in fact, one of the people who are currently under quarantine at the base and due to patient confidentiality rules, no other specifics on why why were brought to hospital were released.

We’ve reached out to Public Health Canada for more information."

Look into him.  What did the Chinese gov do to him?

Look at the under-reporting of cases.  Government again is to blame.

Anyone can see that big government can't stop a virus and often makes it worse.  Just like they can't do anything to affect the climate positively. (The point of the meme) 

If anything, the focus on climate change has siphoned money away from local conservation efforts that actually help the planet.

We need to go back to the Captain Planet days.

I think the most interesting part of your comment is that you imply ""of course governments can't stop a virus"" while also implying ""governments can stop climate change."""

State Department spokeswoman Morgan Ortagus said the United States was “deeply concerned” about the vulnerability of the North Korean people to COVID-19, which originated in neighboring China where it has killed more than 1,300 people.

Ortagus said the United States supported efforts of aid groups to contain the spread of the virus in North Korea.

“The United States is ready and prepared to expeditiously facilitate the approval of assistance from these organizations,” she said in a statement.

Aid groups traveling to North Korea seek exemptions from sweeping US and UN sanctions, which were imposed over the authoritarian state’s nuclear and missile work.
The United States eased its approach on humanitarian aid last year as diplomacy stepped up with North Korea on its nuclear program but it still maintains tough restrictions, including a ban on all travel to the country by US citizens.

Officials in tightly controlled North Korea have said nothing about coronavirus cases but state media this week said foreigners would undergo a 30-day quarantine.

North Korea has entirely banned foreign tour groups, which come largely from China, according to a major tour operator.
The US offer of support comes amid a deadlock in diplomacy between North Korea and the United States.

Three meetings between US President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un failed to secure a landmark nuclear accord, with Pyongyang firing short-range rockets and demanding an end to sanctions.
But US officials have been cautiously hopeful after North Korea did not go through with more drastic action following Kim’s New Year’s speech, in which he warned that his regime would no longer abide by a pause on nuclear and long-range missile tests."

> SINGAPORE - Singapore can contain the spread of the coronavirus through Total Defence and keep going, just as it rallied to overcome the Sars crisis in 2003, said Defence Minister Ng Eng Hen.

> In his Total Defence Day message released on Friday (Feb 14), Dr Ng noted that Singapore is currently grappling with the outbreak of a coronavirus disease, known as Covid-19, which originated from Wuhan in China and has spread globally.

> He then recounted how Sars, or severe acute respiratory syndrome, had caused sickness and death.

> The fear of being infected gripped citizens everywhere, tourists stopped travelling and people stayed home, he said. As a result, jobs were lost and retrenchments went up.

> ""In some countries, this fear created distrust and divided people. But in Singapore, we rallied through Total Defence, stayed united, overcame the Sars crisis to emerge intact and stronger,"" he said.

> The national defence framework has to come into action again against the coronavirus, Dr Ng said.

> As part of social defence, everyone has to practise good hygiene and stay away from others if sick, he urged. ""At the same time, we must show empathy and compassion to help those who are infected or under quarantine.""

> Psychological defence has to be strengthened to withstand the ups and downs from the virus outbreak, he added.

> Daily life can go on with sensible precautions, such as washing one's hands and keeping them away from the face, he said.

> He added that Singaporeans also have to guard against digital threats like false information during this period.

> The minister said digital defence, the latest pillar of Total Defence, was a timely and necessary addition, as dealing with the virus outbreak has shown.

> Related Story Interactive: Places impacted by the coronavirus so far

> False information about the disease or messages to incite hatred against any group do much harm, he noted.

> ""We must never let these Drums - distortions, rumours, untruths, misinformation and smears - be heard lest they sow discord, divide our people and ultimately weaken our will to defeat the outbreak and defend Singapore.""

> Total Defence Day is commemorated on Feb 15 every year - the day Singapore fell to the Japanese in 1942, which was followed by three and a half years of Japanese Occupation.

> Digital defence was added last year as the sixth pillar of Total Defence, which was introduced in 1984 to rally all Singaporeans behind the Singapore Armed Forces should the country face a military threat in a conventional war.

> Since then, Total Defence has been re-conceived and applied to address non-military challenges such as pandemics, economic recessions and natural disasters.

> Economic, social, psychological, military, and civil defence make up the other five pillars of Total Defence.

> Related Story Coronavirus cases in Singapore: What we know so far

> Even while dealing with the coronavirus, Singapore has to ensure its economy can function to keep jobs, he said. ""The Government will work with companies and unions to ensure that retrenchments are kept to a minimum, if at all.""

> Dr Ng also said the country's civil and military defences are ""in good working order"".

> He offered his condolences to families of victims who have suffered, and saluted front-line staff, such as doctors, nurses and healthcare workers who treat patients every day.

> As Singapore marks Total Defence Day, he said he has every confidence Singaporeans will again rally and win the fight against the coronavirus.

> ""If we maintain that resolve, with each Singaporean committed to doing their part, then Singapore can continue to be a shining example for many years to come.""

They have all the information by now.  They're aghast that the US would use a weapon of mass destruction during peace time against civilians.  They're shocked that the US developed an ethnic bioweapon that targets specifically Asian males.  The virus can still escape China and endanger the people of other nations because while non-asians are less susceptible they're not immune.  They're shocked by the sheer immorality and recklessness of it.  

They see the US as a pariah nation now, and they're putting their heads together to figure out what to do next about the US.  This includes Western and non-Western nations, traditional allies, enemies, basically everyone.  Who's the real bad guy here?

In short, the reason Carrie Lam won’t (can’t?) close the borders is largely political. Quoting a portion of this SCMP article (https://www.google.com/amp/s/amp.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/politics/article/3049111/coronavirus-why-wont-carrie-lam-shut-hong-kongs-border):
//
At the heart of Lam’s dilemma was a political problem, said Lau Siu-kai, vice-chairman of the semi-official Chinese Association of Hong Kong and Macau Studies. 

“Carrie Lam already does not have a lot of political capital to dispense with, after her debacle in handling the prolonged civil unrest,” Lau said. “Bear in mind, she has already asked Beijing for a lot of favours, such as the suspension of individual travel visas for mainlanders to come to Hong Kong. 

“Crucially, Lam still has to rely on Beijing for her own political survival and ongoing cooperation from the mainland authorities on information sharing and resources to defeat the epidemic.”

The veteran political commentator said the opposition camp and the medical sector’s actions might have backfired though. 

“It’s kind of pushed her into a corner, where she risks humiliation if she backs down,” he said. “Right now she doesn’t have many options left, that’s why she has been dragged kicking and screaming, and only announced limited border closures and other measures bit by bit.”
//

The CCP is free to lockdown** any cities within Mainland China itself and no one will say a thing. After all, it’s “their land”, they call the shots.

BUT, it’s a total different ball game in Hong Kong, since most of the rest of the world still view it independently from China. Last year’s protests also caught a lot of attention from all over the world, in particular Western media. If they were to close the borders now, it will surely make the news, and the CCP will definitely not like it.

** Speaking of that, as the Wuhan lockdown began, but by which approx 5 out of its total population of 11 million had already left the city (be it intentionally fleeing, or unintentional due to the upcoming CNY long holidays that came just after the Wuhan govt finally dropped the announcement of the virus spread in the city), lots of villages in the outskirts of Hubei started taking matters into their own hands. 

Some stacked walls of bricks “locking their village in” to protect themselves, others got fellow villagers to take turns standing guard as “border control”. So long as their actions don’t catch much attention from the outside world particularly the media, the CCP and the gong an won’t bat an eyelid.

Whereas on the other hand, you have people from Wuhan who post online about what’s happening - doctors like the whistleblower doc the late Dr Li Wenliang (who sadly succumbed to the virus) where the only thing he did was to send a text to his medical school alumni group in WeChat to advise his peers to don PPE just to be safe, after he saw a number of patients with what he felt was a “SARS-like virus” and the next thing he knows is he gets arrested for “spreading rumours”. Like WTF.

So yeah, can you imagine if HK were to close all its borders to China, and it makes worldwide news? Surely the CCP has no way to go pounding on doors of the news agencies outside of China or HK, but they will pretty certainly NOT handle it well, and the likelihood is that they’ll just turn their pounding fists on Hong Kong instead for causing them “embarrassment”. Sigh."

China itself has been fudging the numbers from the very beginning, which is scarcely - if at all - denied. Furthermore, the methodology and criteria for both testing patients and listing them as official numbers has changed so many times at this point that nobody's quite sure of what's going on. In addition to this, many people who are sick are turned away due to the medical system being swamped. There's a plethora of more mild and asymptomatic cases that are undocumented, as well as deaths that occur outside facilities. Even patients that die in the hospital system are often labeled with a cause of death other than the coronavirus, such as ""organ failure"" or ""pneumonia,"" both of which fall under the effects of the virus.

Basically, we're reaching in the dark as far as any official numbers are concerned. To avoid a worldwide panic, there's been a slow unraveling of the truth regarding CORVID-19."

I was stable on one blood pressure medication for many years. Then I had to be switched to a new med when the first one was recalled last year because it was one of the made-in-China generics that was suspected of containing a cancer-causing contaminant. Because of widespread shortages of similar still-available meds at the time, the 2nd med had to be chosen primarily on the basis of availability, rather than effectiveness. Then the 2nd med was recalled, too, and I had to be switched to a third med.

Now I wonder if the Corona virus crisis will affect the availability of my current medication, as  ""Wuhan is a significant player in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industry, with multiple pharmaceutical companies located in the city.""

Testing is FOC, and all inpatient bills arising out of the coronavirus (excludes outpatient bills) will be footed entirely by the government. 

Also, when three cases came up that our health ministry’s contact tracing team couldn’t determine which of the existing infected cases or where else they had gotten it from, they roped in the police’s criminal investigation dept (CID) to help and finally managed to trace that it was linked to two of the early cases, Chinese nationals who had arrived from Wuhan. The couple had visited the same church that the later diagnosed three local cases also attend.
(https://www.todayonline.com/singapore/cid-officers-helped-moh-identify-wuhan-coronavirus-cluster-paya-lebar-church-police-get-involved)

P.S. The importance of tracing and linking up all the infected cases is so that we can know just which stages we are at, whether the virus is spreading far and wide within the community where there’s no way to determine where one gets it from, or not. And that can then reflect nationwide decisions as well as advice to the people on how to manage.

As of now, our Health ministry has determined that we are at DORSCON level Orange, i.e. Disease is severe and spreads easily from person to person, but disease has not spread widely in Singapore and is being contained. Impact on daily life is moderate, e.g. quarantine, temperature screening, visitor restrictions at hospitals.

Along with them come the wumao right on cue saying ""yeah!"" Taiwannews is not the Washington Post, we get it. It isn't Xinhua either. They go to the trouble of translating and taking news from Chinese sources, blogs and message boards (even reddit, big deal) and they do it quickly and probably don't get paid much to do it.

If you don't like the quality of their reporting, just wait for CNA, or Taipei Times, or wait for Brian Hioe to do a piece on something. You might be waiting a while, but at least you won't be getting a bug up your ass about any minor inaccuracies or things that are too close to the rumor mill for your comfort level. I like Taiwannews because they are fast. If I want to check into something a bit further, I'll spend a few minutes on google doing just that, like I would do with any news source actually.

Also what's up with Brian Hioe being all on board with WHO's new politically correct term for the China virus?

The simplest and effective  way is to wash your hands with water and soap.   before and after eating food. After bathroom and after coaugting and seneezing(Mainly in before and after food and after coaugting and seneezing). 
Try hard to coaugting and seneezing  in tisu or elbow.
When you are sick you stay at home. Do not come to public places such as: work , kindergarden and school.
Have you came back from China? Report it in the ministry of health's website. (The URL link)
Watch out , in the new instructions of the ministry of health you need to  isolate (I'm thinking is self isloate)  for 14 days from the date arriving back from China  and not make a direct contact to relatives .
Keeping up the orders can avoid the infection of coronavirus in Israel.

You should be skeptical of extraordinary (and dubious) claims like this. Wuhan is a city of 11 million. People there still have contact with the outside world. If the death rate was really that high, they wouldn't need a ""leak"" to get the information out. 

Also, Chen Quishi is what you might call an unreliable narrator. His reporting on the Hong Kong protests, for example, deliberately omitted acts of violence committed by protestors in an effort to craft a narrative of peaceful protestors. Western news outlets are just taking him at face value regarding the coronavirus, without actually investigating further. It makes for effective anti-China propaganda, whether it's true or not.

Pol Maj Gen Chuon Narin, a Preah Sihanouk provincial police, said that a government working group is aboard the ship to give medical checks to the more than 2,200 passengers and crew before they are allowed to disembark. They will be given visas free of charge.
“Immigration police and health officials are checking the documents and doing medical checkup on them,” the Khmer Times quoted him as saying said.

“We suspect that 20 of the passengers may be infected with coronavirus and their blood samples will be  flown to Phnom Penh to expedite matters,” he said.

Similar to earlier this month when health officials there announced another person was also under voluntary quarantine over similar concerns, these individuals will remain under quarantine for two weeks following their departure from China.

Currently, county health officials describe these individuals as asymptomatic.

Symptoms of the novel coronavirus may include:

Runny nose
Headache
Cough
Sore throat
Fever
A general feeling of being unwell.
CDC officials recommend that people avoid all nonessential travel to Wuhan, China. Additionally, health department officials say certain everyday proactive measures can help stop the spread of the virus, including:

Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. If soap and water are not available, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer.
Avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth with unwashed hands.
Avoid close contact with people who are sick.
Stay home when you are sick.

Unknown. Massive lockdowns of Chinese cities. Citizens trying to escape. For the global audience, this equals coronavirus, not because they know the virus is the cause—proof is beside the point. 

>The virus is the cause because IT MUST BE. WHAT ELSE COULD IT BE?

>A plane full of passengers explodes right after takeoff and falls into the ocean. A faulty engine must be the cause. WHAT ELSE COULD IT BE? Missile strike? Ridiculous.

>A CIA director is found face down in a marsh along a river. He died of a heart attack. WHAT ELSE COULD IT BE?

>When brutal air pollution in Wuhan obviously brings on lung disease; and when the primary symptom of the coronavirus is supposed to be lung disease; and when citizens of the city have been falling ill and dying from lung disease long before the virus appeared—does this matter?

>OF COURSE NOT. IT MUST BE THE VIRUS.

>When governments and corporations have been using THE VIRUS as a cover story to obscure and explain away their crimes against populations, for decades and decades—does this matter?

>When previous so-called epidemics—for example, West Nile, SARS, Zika, and Swine Flu—turned out to be complete unproven duds—does this history matter?

>OF COURSE NOT. IT HAS TO BE THE VIRUS. WHAT ELSE COULD IT BE?

>A face on a television screen watched by millions of people says CORONAVIRUS. Therefore, case closed.

>In 2009, in La Gloria, Mexico, on a giant commercial pig farm, pig feces and urine are allowed to bake and steam and bubble in the sun. These deposits are called lagoons. They’re so large, you can see them from outer space. Toxic chemicals are routinely sprayed and laid out like whipped cream on the lagoons. Workers are falling ill. New workers are brought in to spray even more toxic chemicals. Workers die. 

>Then the Centers for Disease Control sends in their tuned-up virus hunters to look for the germ causing the “mysterious” illness. They claim to find a Swine Flu virus. IT MUST BE THE VIRUS. WHAT ELSE COULD IT BE? THE DECAYING PIG SHIT AND URINE? The layers of poisonous chemicals? Don’t be ridiculous.

>Later, in the summer of 2009, CBS investigative reporter Sharyl Attkisson discovers that the overwhelming percentage of tissue samples from US Swine Flu patients are coming back from labs with no sign of ANY KIND OF FLU. The virus isn’t there.

>And yet, of course, we have this, written in the summer of 2009: From healthwyze.org:

“The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office has a patent for, Genetically Engineered Swine Influenza Virus and Uses Thereof (patent #8124101). It was filed in 2005 for approval. The makers of the human variant of the swine flu virus waited until the patent was finally approved in January of 2009, before unleashing the virus into the wild. The makers of the swine flu vaccine had begun the lengthy patenting process long before the swine flu supposedly existed, which means that the outbreak was no accident, and the virus is clearly not natural. Patents only apply to man-made items, and natural things cannot be patented. The virus conveniently went public only after its vaccine patent was approved, after patiently waiting 3 years for that to happen. The pandemic was declared just five months after the patent was approved, in June of 2009. The tremendous hysteria following the outbreak was promoted by the same groups who had invented this genetically engineered virus. The word ‘invented’ was actually used to describe the virus in the patent application.”

>What do you know about that? Back then, there were reports that the Swine Flu Virus—which couldn’t even be found in the overwhelmingly number of US patients—was actually a biowarfare germ. Sound familiar? And yet Swine Flu was a DUD.

>Another epidemic that was going to infect the world? West Nile Virus. Another dud. But here from an old whale.to article:

>“None of these theories [about West Nile] has deterred Vermont Senator Patrick Leahy from urging federal officials to determine if the introduction of WN virus is a terrorist attack. On September 12, 2002, Leahy declared: ‘I think we have to ask ourselves: Is it a coincidence that we’re seeing such an increase in WN virus – or is that something that’s being tested as a biological weapon against us’.” Sound familiar?

>And here, from and old article at rediff.com, a piece about another epidemic dud, SARS 2003 (800 people died out of 7 billion):

“The virus of atypical pneumonia, better known as SARS, or Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome, was created artificially, possibly as a bacteriological weapon, Sergei Kolesnikov, academician of the Russian Academy of Medical Sciences, told a press conference in the Siberian town of Irkutsk on Thursday, the Russian RIA Novosti news agency reported.”

“According to Kolesnikov, the virus of atypical pneumonia is a synthesis of the viruses of measles and infectious parotiditis or mumps, the natural compound of which is impossible. This can be done only in a laboratory, he said.”

“Kolesnikov added that in creating bacteriological weapons, a protective anti-viral vaccine is, as a rule, worked out at the same time, so a medicine for atypical pneumonia may soon appear.”

“He did not, however, rule out the possibility that the virus could have spread accidentally as a result of ‘an unsanctioned leakage’ from a biological weapons laboratory.”

>Sound familiar? And yet the “epidemic” was a dud.

>In 1987, a doctor calls me, while I’m writing my first book, AIDS INC. He tells me he’s built a small AIDS clinic where a group of poverty-stricken patients can rest in clean surroundings, eat nutritious food, and grow beans and sell them for a small amount of money. This doctor is mainstream. He’s given his patients no medical treatment. 

>He knows that THE VIRUS, HIV, is said to be a remorseless killer. But, he tells me, all his patients have recovered; they no longer have symptoms. He’s puzzled, confused, and distraught. 

>He asks me, “What should I do next?” He knows the AIDS drugs are highly toxic. He senses that giving them to his now-healthy patients would bring on a disaster. Oh but you see, IT MUST BE THE VIRUS. WHAT ELSE COULD BE CAUSING THESE PEOPLE TO BECOME SICK IN THE FIRST PLACE? Drinking the water in their villages—water mixed directly with sewage? Hunger? Starvation? Don’t be ridiculous.

>In an interview, a famous New York doctor tells me all scientists agree that HIV is the cause of AIDS because, well, the scientists who don’t agree can’t get their findings published. He’s telling me all VISIBLE scientists agree.

>Several years ago, during the Zika virus hysteria (another dud epidemic, of microcephaly, that surely would “decimate populations”), researchers in the epicenter, in Brazil, report that only between 10 and 15 percent of Zika patients have any trace of the virus—they can’t find it in the other patients. This amounts to a bald confession that Zika is eliminated as the cause of disease in pregnant women. But no one listens. IT MUST BE THE VIRUS. WHAT ELSE COULD IT BE?

>Well, it turns out it could be ANY INJURY OF ANY KIND TO A PREGNANT MOTHER—causing her baby to be born with a smaller head and brain damage, called microcephaly.

>But here, in a 2016 article from thesleuthjournal.com, we have this:

>“It’s [Zika virus] being spread by genetically engineered mosquitos. Is it the latest example of US biowarfare? America’s sordid history suggests it.” If it was being spread in that fashion, it wasn’t working to cause disease. It was a failure. BUT IT MUST BE THE VIRUS. WHAT ELSE COULD IT BE?

>And of course, the World Health organization hit the hysteria button at the time. From marketwatch.com, January 28, 2016:

“The World Health Organization will convene an emergency committee in Geneva on Monday to discuss the mosquito-borne Zika virus, which the organization’s head said is spreading ‘explosively’ and which many doctors and health officials believe is linked to an unprecedented outbreak of babies born with small heads in Brazil…’The level of alarm is extremely high,’ WHO Director-General Margaret Chan said in remarks to the public-health agency’s executive board…WHO’s announcement underscores the speed with which a virus that began as an obscure tropical malady afflicting Africa and then several remote Western Pacific islands has transformed into a major international health concern, particularly in the Americas.”

>Dud. If WHO could squeeze out more fear, NOW, in 2020, about an ever-expanding Zika crisis, don’t you think they would? Even THEY’VE given up the ghost on that campaign.

>BUT IT MUST BE THE VIRUS. WHAT ELSE COULD IT BE?

>It could be lie after titanic lie."

Out of the FAANG stocks it has the most potential. 

Google isn’t run well and has a terrible track record. Bad phones that copy the iPhone. Services that copy Apple but are slow to adoption etc. They are also less diverse than Apple - which is something people complain about. Apple has computers, phones, tablets, wearables and services. Google has... ads. Their phones don’t make much money. They don’t make tablets anymore and their business model to give things away/sell it cheaply to harvest data is so 2010’s. Users are noticing and don’t want taken from them. 

Facebook will probably not be around within the next 10 years. Think of it as an even less diverse Google except with a product not a lot of people like using. Google at least has search and YouTube that people consistently use. Facebook has an uncool social media. Even with instagram I don’t see it going anywhere but down. Social media’s are fads. How long till insta is uncool?

Amazon from a marketplace perspective is fine but there isn’t much growth left there. And their cloud offerings are nice but can be replaced by alternatives that are more specific for a programmers use case. It will continue to go up but if it gets one weird quarter perception might change. 

Netflix will either be bought by Disney or go under. It cannot compete with Disney (Plus and Hulu + ESPN). Also Apple is doing their own originals so given time Apple users will either use Apple TV Plus or one of Disney’s offerings. Their originals are hit and miss and aren’t worth the monthly price if you only like a couple. 

The real problem with Apple is perception. But that’s what makes it a better investment. It’s more predictable because investors WILL tell you their opinions on Apple and you can kinda use it as an indicator for the price."

Virus mutate, both to be more lethal and less lethal.  For flu viruses, the strains that circulate tend to mutate to less lethal over time as it is a better survival tactic for the virus.  Extreme lethality is something that sometimes happens after viruses jump species barriers as they are poorly adapted to their hosts.

Most mutated versions will still be considered COVID-19 as it will be 99%+ the same genetic code and we are not using gene sequencing to completely identify viruses, but some subset of proteins in their outer jacket.  Our labeling for species and viruses are unable to convey the subtlety of how organisms change and evolve over time.   Horses can mate with Donkeys to create usually sterile Mules as the two are so similar as to almost be the same species.  There is just a large gray area as to where to label something a new species or virus.  I would imagine people can catch more than one type of coronavirus at a time and hybrids will occur as the DNA fragments mix in our cells.  Evolution is always an arms race.

On a somewhat hopeful note (depending on your point of view) , the less lethal varieties should circulate more quickly  and when people get them they will acquire some immunity (at least for a year or two) to the more lethal strains."

I'm Dutch Surinamese and just like the coronavirus is not just an asian thing, being violent is not just a black thing. How stupid can you be. I came here to learn more about how asian people are dealing with this stuff in my country but I regret even coming here it's just filled with racism.


What racism? being smart when on the streets is racism? 

So it's racist when an old asian couple walks the opposite side of the street to avoid being potentially robbed and beaten?
But it's not racist when black people beat,rob, and call Asian people chinks? You make no sense.

I can't even give you 10 cases of asian people attacking, assaulting, or robbing black people in america the last 10 years.
But i can give you more than 10  cases of black people attacking, assaulting asian people in just the last 1 yr in america.

Statistics and facts are racist huh?

Also when did i say all black people are violent?  
If you lived long enough in this life, especially in america, it's very easy to differentiate a black person who's potentially violent from someone who's not.  

IF you're saying it's racist for asians to walk the other way when seeing blacks, then why do some of my black american friends themselves also say that when they see certain types of black people or group of black kids, they themselves walk the other way.  And they also prefer to live in white neighborhoods rather than  black neighborhoods huh?

Cause regular black people know how violent other blacks are."

2020-02-13,Kujo17,cvnews,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/cvnews/comments/f3az88/heres_how_computer_models_simulate_the_future/fhhisr9/,"Modern computational power allows these models to quickly incorporate multiple inputs, such as a given disease’s ability to pass from person to person and the movement patterns of potentially infected people traveling by air and land. This process sometimes involves making assumptions about unknown factors, such as an individual’s exact travel pattern. By plugging in different possible versions of each input, however, researchers can update the models as new information becomes available and compare their results to observed patterns for the illness. For example, if investigators want to study how closing a particular airport could affect a disease’s global spread, their computers can swiftly recalculate the risk of importing cases through other airports—all the humans need to do is update the network of flight routes and international travel patterns.

But when working with incomplete data, a small error in one factor can have an outsize effect. Uncertainty about something such as COVID-19’s basic reproduction number (R0)—the average number of new cases caused by an infected individual—can disrupt a model’s results. “If you’re wrong about this number, your estimate will be off by orders of magnitude,” says Dirk Brockmann, a physicist at the Institute for Theoretical Biology at Humboldt University of Berlin and the Robert Koch Institute in Germany. The current estimated R0 for the novel coronavirus varies from two to three, placing it somewhere near SARS’s R0 of two to four in 2003 but much lower than measles’s R0 of 12 to 18.

Because each unknown factor introduces more uncertainty to a model, Brockmann and some other researchers favor focusing on a more limited model that relies on just one main factor. His group has concentrated on using international flight data—without figuring in person-to-person transmission—to predict which airports represent the highest-risk gateways for the coronavirus to spread worldwide. “This risk predicts the expected sequence of countries you would find cases in,” Brockmann explains. “The way it unfolded is very much in line with what the mobility model predicted.”

In addition to combining known and uncertain factors about travel and transmission, models must reckon with the impact of public health interventions—such as the adoption of face masks, school closures or larger governmental measures, such as China’s decision to quarantine entire cities—along with international travel bans and constraints. The Hong Kong researchers estimated that China’s quarantine of Wuhan, which started on January 23, was limited in the difference it made because the disease had probably already spread to other cities in the nation. Still, the authors did recommend that “draconian measures that limit population mobility should be seriously and immediately considered in affected areas.” 

Public health experts seem uncertain about the effectiveness of such travel restrictions within and between cities. Other studies of past outbreaks suggest that harsh constraints on movement have only limited effects in delaying the international spread of diseases.

Some researchers work on modeling the results of changes in public behavior and government actions before they happen. Lauren Gardner, a civil engineer and co-director of the Center for Systems Science and Engineering at Johns Hopkins University, has been refining a model designed to help U.S.

 government officials decide which airports should screen arriving passengers with temperature checks and questions and which ones are unlikely to encounter new cases of the novel coronavirus. This information could allow local governments to distribute resources where they are likely to be most needed. “There has been lots of interest from various regional public health offices in using these results to prioritize surveillance efforts,” Gardner says.

But despite the variety of models, many ultimately agree on key points. For instance, between February 4 and 5, the number of confirmed cases rose from fewer than 25,000 to more than 28,000 within the span of a day. But at the time, Vespignani points out, various models agreed the real count was much higher. “I believe every modeling approach [was] pointing to something that [was] over 100,000 [current] cases in the best-case scenario,” he says. At the time this article is going to press, the number of confirmed cases is greater than 45,000.

>Even after declaring a crisis, government seemed focused on managing its image as well as the outbreak

>China’s two new hospitals built in as many weeks were the official face of its fight against the coronavirus in Wuhan. As the city was locked down, authorities promised that thousands of doctors would be on hand to treat 2,600 patients on the facilities’ wards.

>Timelapse videos tracked the almost incomprehensibly fast construction of the hospitals, and state media celebrated their opening in early February. The only thing missing a week later? Patients.

>Four days after its opening, the larger Leishenshan hospital had only 90 patients, on wards designed for 1,600, but was reporting no spare beds, Wuhan city health data, first reported by the Chinese magazine Caixin, showed. The other facility, Huoshenshan, had not yet filled its 1,000 beds a week after opening.

>Meanwhile, the city was setting up emergency hospitals in exhibition halls and a sports stadium, and medics were still turning some ill people away. China has the world’s largest army but it has not deployed any field hospitals to Wuhan

>The cost of trying to curb the coronavirus when it first emerged – high-profile moves to close the market where it originated, cull and destroy livestock, quarantine and compensate victims, cancel mass festivities for the new year – would have seemed a risky gamble for little reward.

>“That might have ended it, or not,” Tsang said. “[But] since you stopped the virus from developing, you have nothing to show. You quashed a potential threat that may not have existed.”

>Even when the government reversed course and announced a crisis, it appeared to be focused on managing its image as well as the disease, he said. It could have deployed medics and a field hospital to Wuhan almost overnight rather than building new hospitals.

>It is unclear why they chose not to do so. But a country setting up field hospitals looks like one in crisis. A government expanding hospitals looks like one in control. “Ten days is a very long time when you are looking at a public health crisis like that,” Tsang said. “But a new hospital built from the ground up, that’s a world record.”"

I've seen the first part of this video with the police in haz suits walking with guns being post on Reddit. But it seems this one has added part.

It seems strange that you can't see gunmen who can be heard shooting.

There are a good few fake videos going around the internet, [like this one example here](https://www.indiatoday.in/amp/fact-check/story/fact-check-did-police-publicly-kill-coronavirus-infected-woman-in-china-1645123-2020-02-10)

Initially they start on Facebook and then spread across to Facebook. There is a US right-wing media group called *America First* that is very active in posting fake news. Steve Bannon is a heavy contributor. You can find their podcasts on Twitter.

We must be very careful here. It seems these right-wing agitators have an agenda.

With such doubt, I have to report.

If you need to keep track of the Coronavirus and it's spread then go on r/china_flu."

They not only control most of China's e-commerce market but also data and finance through Alipay. Some retailers in the US have also been adopting Alipay.

While coronavirus will most likely affect their guidance, they're not going to be affected much with China vowing to protect their market.

If BABA moons after earnings, bless up on our calls.

If it drops, BTFD."

> TOKYO - Japan will allow some elderly passengers on a quarantined cruise liner who test negative for the new coronavirus to disembark ahead of schedule, the health minister said on Thursday, as another 44 new cases were confirmed aboard the Diamond Princess.

> The liner was quarantined on arrival in Yokohama, near Tokyo, on Feb. 3 after a man who disembarked from the liner in Hong Kong before it traveled to Japan was diagnosed with the virus that has now killed more than 1,350 in mainland China.

> The British-flagged Diamond Princess is managed by Princess Cruise Lines, one of the world&#039;s largest cruise lines and a unit of Carnival Corp. Kyodo news agency said the additional 44 cases included 43 passengers and one crew member, with the total number of confirmed cases in Japan rising to 247, including those infected on the Diamond Princess.

The coronavirus has broken out in China, and has already spread to many countries. The major symptoms of disease are fever and cough. An expert team of the Ministry of Health is working to prevent the spread of the virus in Israel. 

In order to reduce the spread of infection, we all must maintain hygiene, and to follow instructions. Simplest and most effective is to wash your hands with water and soap before and after eating, after using the bathroom, and after coughing or sneezing. Make sure always to sneeze into a tissue or into your elbow. When you are sick, always stay home. Do not go to public places, work, kindergarten \[preschool?\] or school. 

Returning from China? As reported on the Ministry of Health Website, please note that according to the new order, home quarantine must be kept for 14 days after returning from China. Don't come into contact with your family members during that time. Follow the instructions; it can prevent the spread of Coronavirus in Israel."

Someone seated in the room, or in the vicinity of the hotel that is renowned for its central location and a racy nightclub in the basement, was about to take coronavirus global.

Three weeks later, global health authorities are still scrambling to work out who carried the disease into the mundane meeting of a firm selling gas meters, which then spread to five countries from South Korea to Spain, infecting over a dozen people.

Experts say finding this so-called “patient zero” is critical for tracing all those potentially exposed to infection and containing the outbreak, but as time passes, the harder it becomes.

We do feel uncomfortable obviously when we diagnose a patient with the illness and we can’t work out where it came from…the containment activities are less effective,” said Dale Fisher, chair of the Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network coordinated by the World Health Organisation.

Fisher and other experts have compared the Singapore meeting to another so-called “super-spreading” incident at a Hong Kong hotel in 2003 where a sick Chinese doctor spread Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome around the world.

The WHO has opened an investigation into the Singapore incident, but said its “way too early” to tell if it is a super-spreading event.
Singapore health ministry’s Kenneth Mak said the government will continue to try and identify the initial carrier until the outbreak ends, but as days pass it will get harder.

“We might never be able to tell who that first patient is,” Mak said.
Meanwhile, the fallout from the conference continues to sow trepidation weeks after the event and thousands of miles away.
Reuters visited Servomex’s offices in the suburbs of South Korea’s capital, Seoul. It was closed and dark inside, and a building guard told Reuters employees were working from home.

A notice posted by building management stated a coronavirus patient had entered the complex, while several young women could be overheard in a nearby elevator discussing whether it had been used by the infected person.

“Do you think the patient would have gotten on this elevator or the other one?” one said."

Good news for you, though, we should go extinct some time this century or at least dwindle considerably because we are destroying our ability to live on this planet.  I see there are vegans here.  I'm a vegetarian myself.  While it comes from a good place, the majority will never adopt such a lifestyle.  In our reckless hubris, we will grind this planet and all other its inhabitants to dust, and that's really the whole point.  Do what you can individually with lifestyle choices and individual acts of kindness toward both human and animal if you so choose but the machine will crank on until industrial civilization collapses.  That should result in the loss of global dimming.  The arctic sea ice is also on its way out.  Jair Bolsonaro wants to gut the Amazon.  We lose species every day.  Materialism, decadence, celebrity culture, Twitter wars, and overconsumption continue on.  This planet is hopelessly fucked more than you can imagine."

> The number of deaths and new cases from China&#039;s coronavirus outbreak spiked dramatically on Thursday after authorities changed the way they count infections in a move that will likely fuel speculation that the severity of the outbreak has been under-reported.

> The jump raised the death toll to 1,355 and the total number of nationwide infections to nearly 60,000 - just hours after President Xi Jinping touted &quot;Positive results&quot; from the government&#039;s drastic measures to contain the virus and a top Chinese expert predicted the epidemic would peak this month.

> The biggest cluster of cases outside China is on a cruise ship quarantined off Japan&#039;s coast.

Health officials said the 43-year-old man, who lives in Tuen Mun, is related to a local 66-year-old man who was diagnosed with the illness on Tuesday.

The authorities said the latest man diagnosed went to work despite feeling ill and that is why his colleagues and his wife have been moved into quarantine.

Officials were also trying to trace three of his clients.

The man developed coughing on January 29 and had nausea two days later. He consulted different doctors three times.

He was admitted to Tuen Mun Hospital on Tuesday and was diagnosed on Wednesday.

Chuang Shuk-kwan, head of the Communicable Disease Branch at the Centre for Health Protection, said the man worked at the Nathan Commercial Building in Yau Ma Tei.

He mostly stayed inside the office while working. His colleagues who did not share the same room as him were to undergo medical monitoring.

The latest victim had dinner with a 66-year-old relative – who later became the 47th victim – and 11 other family members on January 30.

Efforts were being made to trace these relatives, but it was doubtful whether they would need to go into quarantine due to the time that has passed since the dinner."

 Provincial health officials said 242 people had died from the flu-like virus on Wednesday, the fastest daily rise in fatalities so far, with another 14,840 new infections after a change in diagnostic methods.

The outbreak is putting China’s relatively unsophisticated waste treatment system to a massive test. An inadequate waste handling capacity in some regions, together with hefty disposal fees, has helped create an illegal medical waste disposal industry.

Data issued by the Ministry of Ecology and Environment (MEE) on Thursday showed that Hubei, where the virus emerged in December, had a medical waste handling capacity of 317.5 tonnes per day by Feb. 11, up from 180 tonnes per day before the virus outbreak.

“China will take further measures to improve medical waste handling capacity in Hubei... and meanwhile closely monitor the situation in other regions, in order to prevent environmental risks and support the war against the coronavirus,” the MEE said.
Hubei has been collecting 187 tonnes of medical waste each day, with 125 tonnes related to the coronavirus.

Emergency disposal facilities with a capacity of 55.8 tonnes per day can be put into operation at any time, the MEE said, as the number of number of patients getting treated increases and more medical workers are sent to the province.

At least six listed medical waste handling companies have seen their share prices rally after the coronavirus outbreak, boosted by market expectations that regulations will be tightened, as they were after the SARS outbreak in 2003."

> SINGAPORE - Eight more cases of the coronaviruswith links to previous ones have been confirmed in Singapore, bringing the total number of infected people to 58.

> Five of the new cases are linked to the Grace Assembly of God church, including a 54-year-old man who is a National University of Singapore (NUS) professor, the Ministry of Health said on Thursday (Feb 13).

> The professor did not interact with colleagues and students after he fell ill.

> The cluster is now linked to seven confirmed cases, including two announced on Wednesday.

> Another two new cases are Bangladeshi work pass holders, aged 30 and 37, who are linked to a worksite in Seletar Aerospace Heights.

> The worksite is now linked to a cluster of four cases, all of whom are Bangladeshi nationals.

> The last new case is a 30-year-old Singaporean man who is a family member of case 50, the 62-year-old male DBS Bank employee who was confirmed to have the virus on Wednesday.

> None of the new cases have recent travel history to China. They are all currently warded in isolation rooms at the National Centre for Infectious Diseases.

> Of the five linked to the Grace Assembly of God church, two were confirmed to have the virus on Wednesday afternoon, and the other three tested positive on Thursday morning. All eight are Singpaoreans.

> Related Story 300 employees vacate MBFC Tower 3 after coronavirus case confirmed at DBS Asia Central

> They include four men, aged 26, 48, 54 and 58, and one 54-year-old woman.

> Case 51, the 48-year-old man, fell ill on Feb 4 and saw a GP on Feb 5 and 10. He went to the NCID on Feb 11.

> Before being hospitalised, he went to work at both of the church's locations, in Tanglin Road and Bukit Batok West.

> Case 53, the 54-year-old NUS professor, fell ill on Feb 10 and went to the NCID on Feb 12. He tested positive the same day.

> It is unclear if the other three cases linked to the church - cases 54, 57 and 58 - are congregants or workers. Two previous cases in the cluster, cases 48 and 49, were both church workers who visited both locations.

> One of the Bangladeshis confirmed to be infected on Thursday, case 52, fell ill on Feb 7.

> He reported that he had mostly stayed in his rental apartment in Campbell Lane since he fell sick.

> The 37-year-old was identified as a close contact of the two previously identified Bangladeshi work pass holders, who both worked at the Seletar Aerospaces Heights worksite.

> The MOH also said on Thursday that Singapore will continue to rely on laboratory tests to confirm cases of infection.

> It added it would not change its approach to confirming cases of the virus despite Chinese authorities adopting new broader guidelines, including the use of CT scans and clinical diagnosis of symptoms.

> New diagnostic guidelines for confirming cases in China kicked in on Wednesday, allowing doctors to assess patients clinically and diagnose cases.

> This means a patient can be confirmed to be suffering from Covid-19, as the disease is called, if they have symptoms of severe respiratory tract disease and a CT scan shows lesions in their lungs.

> Previously, cases would only be confirmed after laboratory tests.

> The number of confirmed cases in China's Hubei province spiked after the new guidelines were adopted.

> The death toll in Hubei also rose by 242 to 1,310 as of Wednesday after figures were revised to include cases that have not been lab-confirmed.

Including your horrible brother in law, your entire family is racist and you should try your best not to interact with them, especially because now you have your husband (who I'm sure is an amazing person) and your kid. Futhermore, Koreans are actually taller than white people (average height) and that they're not ones to judge others' appearances whether they're white or asian or black in the first place.

ok sorry about my anger induced rant, I'm very passionate against racism.

Back to whether you're TA or not.

NTA.

Like mentioned above, your family are dicks for being racist against Asians, even going as far as making racist, opinionated remarks that can be easily debunked by a simple google search. They're probably those sort of people who shit on Kpop for no specific reason and just hate the idea that Asians are more popular than American artists.

You took the wisest approach. If I was you I'd honestly insult them of their idiocy down to hell (I'm a very vengeful person lol) but you didn't counterattack and just kept your distance, trying to keep your unhealthy relationship with your family healthy and just blocked them. They proceeded to apologise months later just because your child was born, not that they were genuinely sorry. If they were, they would've apologised to your husband."
