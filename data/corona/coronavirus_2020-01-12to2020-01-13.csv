2020-01-12,kanskjedetdu,Anxiety,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/envist/what_the_hell_is_happening/fe5ug6k/,"Just a few things to (hopefully) put your mind at ease:


They have identified the virus - it’s a coronavirus which leads to everything from cold-like symptoms to severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and possibly death. Sounds scary? Imagine how much scarier it would be if it wasn’t identified! Remember: Identifying the virus is the first step towards making vaccines or taking other measurements to stop it spreading.  It’s also very comforting that officials already have placed the severity of this spesific virus somewhere in the middle on the danger-scale, so that is also good. Another goodie is this quote from an interview with Dr. Josie Golding and Prof. Mark Woolhouse: ""(...) we're a lot more prepared to deal with those types of diseases today"" and ""it is not as severe as SARS"". Good, right?



Now, you also have to remember this: new viruses are detected all the time. ALL THE TIME.  Not long ago they found out that the ocean contains 90% MORE viruses than previously detected, sliding in at a baffeling 195,728 different popularions, not ~15.000 as previously recorded. ""Virus"" sounds scary, but most of marine viruses don’t generally infect humans at all (so far/as we know). In this spesific case the virus (very likely) jumped from one species, where they went unnoticed, and onto humans. Perhaps the single most reassuring fact about this outbreak is that the new virus does not appear to spread from one person to another. Before you get too comfy, Prof Woolhouses quote from another interview should be heard: ""I'm cautious rather than sceptical [about the human-to-human transmission], it is early too tell - most coronaviruses are actually transmissible and that would be my initial concern.""



I don’t wanna leave you on a downer, so I’ll keep going for a bit more. How fast is it spreading, you might think? So far, not very. All the 59 patients had symptoms start between 12 December and 29 December 2019. And there have been no further cases reported.



Of course it is scary, and one should always be sceptical, cautious and on the safe side, but there’s no need for panic just yet. I hope this little inforant helps you a little. Hang on, friend!"
