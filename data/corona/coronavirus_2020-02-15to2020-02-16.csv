The speech confirmed for the first time that he was aware of the virus while officials at its epicenter were openly downplaying its dangers.

In the speech, Mr. Xi said that he had initially given orders about the coronavirus outbreak on Jan. 7, during a meeting of the Politburo Standing Committee, the Communist Party’s topmost body. That places Mr. Xi’s involvement with fighting the epidemic earlier than previously known. Mr. Xi’s earliest public comment on the epidemic was Jan. 20, when he gave brief instructions on the issue that were published by state media.

In early January, leaders in Wuhan, the city at the epicenter of the outbreak, were giving open assurances that there was no clear evidence of human-to-human transmission. Mr. Xi did not disclose details of his instructions on Jan. 7, but it seems clear that Wuhan officials would have known that the country’s top leader was paying attention to the outbreak.

The evidence that Mr. Xi was addressing the spread of the coronavirus earlier than previously known has now been released apparently in an effort to show that he has commanded the fight against the epidemic — notwithstanding rumors that he let others take the lead.

The speech in which Mr. Xi described his initial involvement in countering the spread of the coronavirus was published by Qiushi, or Seeking Truth, the Communist Party’s top doctrinal journal. Mr. Xi gave the speech on Feb. 3, when the coronavirus was spiraling into a national crisis for China, prompting the lockdown of Wuhan and other hard-hit cities in Hubei Province, and a chain reaction of restrictions across other parts of the country.

Mr. Xi is a dominant figure in Chinese politics, and his utterances are treated as lodestones by officials. Here are some other main points from the newly published Feb. 3 speech:

Mr. Xi in charge: Mr. Xi emphasized that he has been constantly involved in decisions about the crisis, and he indicates that he gave the authorization to put Wuhan and other areas of Hubei under an unprecedented lockdown from Jan. 23. In the speech, Mr. Xi recalled: “I clearly demanded that Hubei Province exercise comprehensive, strict control over the outflow of individuals.”

Two focal points in a nationwide ‘people’s war’: Mr. Xi describes the effort to end the epidemic as an all-encompassing “people’s war” across China. But he singles out two key battlegrounds: Hubei Province, where the infections and deaths have been concentrated, and Beijing, the national capital. “Beijing has a special status,” Mr. Xi told the meeting. He said: “Strengthen management and control of key populations.”

Controlling the narrative: Mr. Xi stresses the importance of preserving social stability through easing public fear, providing adequate supplies of food and other needs, and demonstrating confidence that the epidemic can be beaten. And he also emphasizes winning over public opinion at home and abroad. “There must be closer monitoring and assessment of opinion, proactively speaking out and giving positive guidance,” Mr. Xi said of Chinese public sentiment. “Seize the initiative and effectively shape international opinion,” he added. “Tell well the story of China’s fight against the epidemic.”

Coping with economic damage: Mr. Xi acknowledges that the epidemic and fight to curtail it will drag on China’s economy by putting pressure on industry, especially smaller firms; by slowing construction projects; and by cooling domestic and foreign trade. In response, Mr. Xi said, the government will provide financial support for businesses, help migrant workers return to their jobs when production resumes, and step up support for projects. He also said the blow to consumer spending could be offset by encouraging spending in new areas, such as 5G phone networks, as well as online entertainment and education.

2020-02-15,ne0ndistraction,Coronavirus,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/f4ho0n/cruise_ship_passengers_pissed_about_2week/fhqql1f/," YOKOHAMA, Japan — American passengers under coronavirus lockdown on the Diamond Princess cruise ship in Yokohama were told Saturday of U.S. plans to take them home. But some were outraged by the new rules: 14 additional days of quarantine back in the United States.

""It's completely devastating,"" said Karey Sells, 44, from St. George, Utah. ""If they wanted to keep us under quarantine for an additional period, they should have picked us up 10 days ago. They should have done their job.""

The announcement was a shift from previous U.S. statements that the passengers were best serving out their quarantine aboard the ship, and that passengers would not have to do more once they returned home.

The Japanese government also announced that an additional 67 people on the ship were found to have the virus, out of the latest batch of 217 who were tested, although more than half showed no symptoms. That brings to 285 the number of passengers and crew members who have been found to be infected out of 930 tested, more than 30 percent.

Sells, who is self-employed, said the forced absence would harm her business. She thinks people testing positive for the virus probably contracted it before the quarantine period began, but says the U.S. government should have sent experts at the start to assess whether the quarantine on the ship was effective.

“They should have done this on the very first day,” she said, close to tears. “And now 400 American citizens are going to suffer because of their incompetence.”

Sells doesn’t even know whether her husband, a Canadian citizen who owns a small business in the United States, will be able to travel with her.

“That’s basically a month of our lives we are being held captive,” she added. “And without just cause — we didn’t commit a crime.”

**New cases on the ship**

The ship, with 2,666 passengers and 1,045 crew members, began a 14-day quarantine on Feb. 5. The end was supposed to come on Wednesday, and passengers anticipated being able to return home. But as more tests were carried out, it became clear that a high percentage of people had the virus, and experts warned that there was a risk it could still be spreading on the ship.

In acknowledgment of those risks, [Japan changed course](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/asia_pacific/japan-relaxes-cruise-ship-quarantine-for-elderly-amid-fears-of-virus-spread/2020/02/13/4e0e2470-4e43-11ea-967b-e074d302c7d4_story.html?tid=lk_inline_manual_19&itid=lk_inline_manual_19) and began evacuating some passengers before the quarantine period ended, beginning with people older than 80 and with underlying health problems. It also stepped up its program of testing passengers.

After initially backing Japan’s approach toward the ship, the U.S. government has now also implicitly acknowledged that the Diamond Princess may not have been the best place to keep the American travelers.

“We are deeply grateful to the cruise line and government of Japan for working diligently to contain and control the spread of the illness,” the U.S. Embassy in Tokyo wrote in an email to Americans on the ship.

“However, to fulfill our government’s responsibilities to U.S. citizens under our rules and practices, as well as to reduce the burden on the Japanese health care system, the U.S. government recommends, out of an abundance of caution, that U.S. citizens disembark and return to the United States for further monitoring.”

It was a decision that some passengers said should have been made much earlier.

“Why didn’t they test everybody \[earlier\] and it would have been over?” asked Melanie Haering, 58, of Tooele, Utah, echoing a question many people have asked from the beginning.

**'Frightening'**

Medical experts have expressed concerns that the virus could still be spreading on the ship, possibly through the crew, or even perhaps through the air conditioning system — although the captain has repeatedly assured passengers that the air in their cabins is fresh rather than recycled. More than 20 crew members have tested positive for the virus.

The email said the State Department, working with the Department of Health and Human Services and other agencies, will provide a chartered aircraft to passengers directly from Japan to Travis Air Force Base in California, and for some passengers on to Lackland Air Force Base in Texas.

The plane will arrive in Japan on Sunday evening. Passengers will be screened for symptoms and then taken by bus to the plane. “We are working with our Japanese partners to ensure that any symptomatic passengers receive the required care in Japan if they cannot board the flight,” the embassy said.

“Travelers returning to the United States from high-risk areas are required to undergo quarantine. Accordingly, you will need to undergo further quarantine of 14 days when you arrive in the United States,” the email said.

“We understand this is frustrating and an adjustment, but these measures are consistent with the careful policies we have instituted to limit the potential spread of the disease.”

Passengers who choose not to return on this flight will be unable to return to the United States “for a period of time,” the embassy wrote.

Several passengers said they viewed the additional quarantine period as the wisest course of action but still found the news tough to process.

“Having hoped that three, four days from now, I’d be getting on a plane and this would be all behind me, now facing another 14-day quarantine on a military institution where the conditions — I imagine they’re obviously going to be more sanitary, but they’re going to be vastly different — it is frightening,” said Spencer Fehrenbacher, 29, a U.S. citizen whose family immigrated to Canada in 2016."

In animal studies, they have reduced levels of the coronaviruses that cause severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS)1. Remdesivir, a nucleotide analogue made by the biotechnology company Gilead in Foster City, California, has had some success against coronaviruses in animals, too2. In January, researchers reported that one person in the United States survived a COVID-19 infection after being treated with remdesivir3. During the first week of February, China launched two placebo-controlled trials on remdesivir, slated to include 760 people with COVID-19. The studies should be completed by the end of April, and remdesivir could be approved by Chinese authorities as early as May, says Shibo Jiang, a virologist at Fudan University in Shanghai. “But the epidemic might be gone by then,” he says.

>China has launched a few trials that test chloroquine, a malaria drug that killed off the new coronavirus (recently named SARS-CoV-2) in cell culture4. And researchers are studying whether steroids diminish inflammation in people with severe COVID-19, or cause harm. “It will be interesting to see these results,” says Yazdan Yazdanpanah, an epidemiologist from France’s national health agency, INSERM, in Paris. Research clinicians around the world will need this information if the outbreak continues to spread, he adds."

Wuhan had about 2,000 confirmed cases among a metro population of 19 million on 25Jan20.  Let's say the actually number is 10 times higher so 20,000 infected to be safe.  If you do the math that is an estimated 105 exported cases among the 100,000 people.

For the ship, let's compare to Diamond princess which has 285 infected out of 3770 (7.5%)

If Westerdam has half that rate infected, there will be (2346*0.035) = 82 cases among passengers

""in a crowded city where they eat all sorts of wild animals."" 

Plenty of crowded cities. Food source not relevant to propagation of disease.

""the reason that China’s medical workers are getting sick is because they don’t have enough gear to prevent virus from spreading.""

That doesn't explain the Japanese medical workers getting sick despite having full gear.

""The economy is more important than this""

The people of Wuhan clearly feel otherwise.  You may too, when it comes to your city.

""let the places like CDC and WHO ... handle this- instead of mass hysteria...""

There's a lot of room between ""let someone else handle this"" and ""mass hysteria"".  Better to put accurate info out, so people are not caught mentally unprepared when the global war against the virus comes to their own neighborhood. The real mass hysteria comes when people have been told ""don't worry"" and then reality arrives. Getting people thinking and talking about global problems will stimulate better ideas and more positive actions."

Hubs and I had a trip to Puerto Rico planned in December, but we ended up cancelling our plane tickets when further research revealed how unreliable Zika virus testing there has been in the past year (I'm pregnant). 

So, with a trip West to Hawaii next month, my parents have been sending me worried texts about the coronavirus and how we were putting our unborn daughter's life at risk. 

Again, deep further research reveals we'll be okay. Perhaps we're in a better situation than you though because Hawaii has no coronavirus hits (yet). If we somehow fall into a quarantine, I work remotely and husband is confident his work won't fire him over missing. Anyway, majority of those infected get better, and out of those who've passed, most have had previous health issues- and so far Husband and I are very healthy. 

Also, my mom is a huge ball of anxiety. I recently went on a scooter (manual not electric) on a smooth sidewalk and she freaked out about how I'm putting my baby at risk... So, at an early age I realized I had to do my own deep research to make judgement calls."

OP your mistake is thinking the CDC and federal government actually decided to try to stop this coming into the US.  Maybe they should have, but they didn't.   It is very easy to come into the US now if you have been in China in the last month.  There is only a small amount of screening being done now in a few major airports.

Yes, the coronavirus should be taken seriously and avoided. However, our current understanding of the virus is that it's not nearly as dangerous as the media initially described it.

It's believed that there are many unreported cases because the milder symptoms would be similar to a cold or flu. Many of the ones being hospitalized belong to at-risk groups. Vaccines are the number one protection strategy for these groups, so the lack of one is playing a large role in how the situation is playing out.

I've been using nicotine lozenges for months to assist with brain health. There are a number of studies suggesting that it might help with depression, Alzheimer's, and Parkinson's.  You can get it OTC, or Amazon, and break up a tablet into smaller pieces.  I take 1 or 2 mg/day.

I noticed my handwriting improved since taking it and no colds this year.  While I'd never smoke, oral nicotine has been well tolerated and I haven't felt any addiction.

Most Singaporeans speak primarily in English with each other— all Singaporeans today are fluent in English, something that the mainland Chinese is not. Even when speaking in Chinese, the dialect is so vastly different from mainland mandarin that communicating in Chinese would be the equivalent of a white American trying to have a conversation with any foreigner in broken English.  There is a huge difference between Singaporean culture and China-Chinese culture, and the mainlanders that have immigrated to Singapore frequently face the same level of ostracism and discrimination as any racial minority might have when immigrating to North America, for example. I would even argue that the level of discrimination towards mainlanders is more prominent in Singapore than in a large metropolitan North American city, seeing as how racism in Singapore is a lot more covert given the obvious fact that they are discriminating against people of the same skin color as themselves. 

The majority of Singaporean cuisine (the majority of this being street food as it’s the most widely consumed) don’t resemble traditional Chinese cuisine any more than it resembles Malaysian cuisine. China-Chinese restaurants in Singapore taking a hit after the eruption of the coronavirus is effectively identical to Chinese restaurants losing business in NYC—SG people avoiding businesses run by mainlanders is identical to white people avoiding Chinese run businesses. They are not being “racist towards themselves” simply because they don’t view mainlanders as one of their own, given the absence of any significant cultural common denominator. To sum up, without commenting on whether the practice of avoiding Chinese restaurants at this time is in itself racist, just wanted to bring to light that SG Chinese are definitely racist towards mainlanders."

> The 1,544 passengers and 802 crew had never expected a port stop in Hong Kong to metastasize into full-blown fear that some of the ship&#039;s passengers carried the novel coronavirus that emerged in Wuhan, China, late last year and has killed more than 1,500 people.

> Cruise ships around Asia face widespread fears they may be spreading the virus since it was found aboard the Diamond Princess that is now at anchor in Yokohama and where 218 of the passengers have been diagnosed with the virus.

And if you have weak immune system then that can also cause sickness and disease . I believe that an immune system that is functioning better then an unactive immune system but not overactivated is the perfect immune system . However most people today have either overactivated  immune system  due to wrong supplements and medications or a weak immune system due to overeating junk food , being overweight and having an inactive lifestyle .                          Therefore I would suggest you to not overindulge on wrong supplements but rather take the appropriate ones and also start going to gym,exercising,maintain ideal bodyweight to height and start eating healthier . The supplement that I suggest is Vitamin D3 (10000iu) which has the ability to modulate innate and adaptive immune response which means that it helps prevents flu and viruses. Taking vitamin d3 in high doses prevents overactivation of immune system. Exclusively for vitamin D3 it's better to have higher then normal level ( Target = Between 60ng/ml to 80ng/ml ) Take vitamin k2 with vitamin D3 so that calcium deposits to your bones , and not arteries , therefore preventing hypercalcemia. Check the coimbra protocol on google which explains miraculous benefit of supplementing high vitamin D3 dosage to prevent autoimmune diseases . If you're deficient in other minerals,vitamins then get them to adequate levels  .

2020-02-15,AnakReddit,Brunei,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Brunei/comments/f4ht7x/fake_news_makes_disease_outbreaks_worse_study/fhqrhki/,"With Reuters reporting that the increase in “fake news” could make disease outbreaks such as the COVID-19 epidemic spreading in China worse, Brunei’s Ministry of Health (MoH) also urged the public to always check information spread on social media.

The ministry reminded the public not to share information that had not been verified by the MoH.

Spreading false news is an offence under the Public Order Act, Chapter 148, Section 34 which can lead to three months’ imprisonment or a BND3,000 fine.

In an analysis of how the spread of misinformation affects the spread of disease, scientists at Britain’s East Anglia University (UEA) said any successful efforts to stop people sharing fake news could help save lives.

“When it comes to COVID-19, there has been a lot of speculation, misinformation and fake news circulating on the Internet – about how the virus originated, what causes it and how it is spread,” said UEA Professor of Medicine Paul Hunter who co-led the study.

“Misinformation means that bad advice can circulate very quickly – and it can change human behaviour to take greater risks,” he added.

In their research, Hunter’s team focussed on three other infectious diseases – flu, monkeypox and norovirus – but said their findings could also be useful for dealing with the COVID-19 coronavirus outbreak.

“Fake news is manufactured with no respect for accuracy, and is often based on conspiracy theories,” Hunter said.

For the studies – published on Friday in separate peer-reviewed journals – the researchers created theoretical simulations of outbreaks of norovirus, flu and monkeypox.

Their models took into account studies of real behaviour, how different diseases are spread, incubation periods and recovery times, and the speed and frequency of social media posting and real-life information sharing.

They also took into account how lower trust in authorities is linked to the tendency to believe conspiracies, how people interact in “information bubbles” online, and the fact that, “worryingly, people are more likely to share bad advice on social media than good advice from trusted sources,” Hunter said.

The researchers found that a 10 per cent reduction in the amount of harmful advice being circulated has a mitigating impact on the severity of an outbreak, while making 20 per cent of a population unable to share harmful advice has the same positive effect.

For information, the public can check the MoH website on www.moh.gov.bn or contact the Health Advise Line at 2381380 or 2381383 or Darussalam line 123."

A massive part of the decrease in economic activity is due to Lunar new year celebrations which were extended this year. 
I work closely with importers who always stock up before every Lunar New Year who tell me that you can’t even contact suppliers let alone make a purchase over this period.

Also let’s look at the fatality rate. It currently stands at 15% with less than 2,000 deaths. To put this into perspective there were over 36,000 vehicle related deaths in the US in 2018 alone.
I do think there will be more deaths, however I’d like to bet that this would not be high enough to have a noticeable economic impact.

Another thing is that when you tell me that 400 million people are in quarantine, about 30% of China’s population, I’m instantly thinking bullshit unless someone proves it to me.
That’s 5800 quarantined people for each person in the world with coronavirus. Seems a bit extreme even for the Chinese."

It's gotta be some small percentage, but even if we look at just [CDC reporting on Influenza alone, it ends up infecting around 10% of the US population annually](https://www.cdc.gov/flu/about/burden/index.html). Covid-19 is twice as contagious as seasonal influenza; the [R-value of Coronavirus is 2.2-2.5 at the moment and may go higher based on incoming data](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/02/04/researchers-say-the-coronavirus-may-be-more-contagious-than-current-data-shows.html) and [""The median R value for seasonal influenza was 1.28 (IQR: 1.19-1.37)""](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25186370). A significant number of people will need to be hospitalized; [15% contract pneumonia and 3-5% require intensive care] (https://www.cnbc.com/2020/02/10/coronaviruslatestupdates.html). If we took 20% (double influenza infections) of the population of the USA (328,000,000) at 65,600,000 and 15% of them need to be hospitalized to survive the virus, then that is still 9,840,000 people. At most 5% (out of total infected) need ICU service to survive; 3,280,000 people. [There are only 94,837 ICU beds in the US](https://www.sccm.org/Communications/Critical-Care-Statistics) and they cannot all be used for one disease. Even a 12th (monthly) of that number at 273,333 people is far too many. 

Not to mention the outrageous costs that American families would incur from an ICU visit due to the healthcare system in the US. Let alone the sheer availability of ICUs in most other less wealthy countries.

There are some people suggesting that the R-value of Covid-19 should go down because after the winter season. The minimum time it takes to show symptoms for Covid-19 is 2 days; some say 24 days. And it spreads throughout that entire incubation period. So you can easily pass it on without knowing that you have it.

Contrast that with Influenza:

[""Symptoms can begin about 2 days (but can range from 1 to 4 days)  after the virus enters the body. That means that you may be able to pass on the flu to someone else before you know you are sick, as well as while you are sick. Some people can be infected with the flu virus but have no symptoms. During this time, those people may still spread the virus to others.""](https://www.cdc.gov/flu/about/disease/spread.htm)

1-4 days VS 2-24 days. Which will be more likely to spread?

[The median incubation days for Covid-19 is 5.2 days and the mean incubation of Influenza is 2 days. ](https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/coronavirus-incubation-period/)

That's more than double the incubation time and suggests that the R-values for Covid-19 should go higher rather than lower."

You've read wrong unfortunately. Influenza has a ridiculous number of strains that can range from 0.1 to 20% fatality rates so it's hard to quantify exactly, but the most common strains usually sit at less than 1%. The nCoV coronavirus is one specific strain so we can narrow the range down quite a bit, but since it's still in an outbreak phase numbers are hard to lock down. Estimates range from 2-3% currently, but that can change pretty quickly in such early stages. 

> and almost exclusively kills older patients.

Or the immunocompromised, same as influenza.

2020-02-15,multiple4,Coronavirus,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/f4f8ca/i_feel_the_same_as_in_the_911/fhqyroe/,"I understand from a perspective of someone who doesn't live in either China or the US how you may feel similarly, but if you had 2 similar scale events happen in your country, one being a natural disaster or outbreak, compared to your country being genuinely attacked, you would not feel the same about them. Not even close. But I do understand your perspective, because as an American I would say i feel similarly about the coronavirus and the Yemen civil war. I think that's kind of the perspective you have as an outsider of both countries is that all disasters are just lumped together

**The difference is this:**

Even if the virus hits hard in the US, we will never feel the same about that as about 9/11. We will just get through the virus and then go on with life after it's finally gone. It wouldn't have the far reaching ramifications. I would compare the coronavirus in China to something like Hurricane Katrina in America. It's still something we all remember, but it doesn't evoke nearly the same feeling for most of us as 9/11 does

9/11 is not something you just moved on from. It changed the way of life in the United States permanently. It put us into a way which we are still involved in as it has evolved over the years. I want you to remember that the number of people who died on one day in this country was over 3k. That's twice the number of people who have died total from the virus so far. 

We had no clue what had just hit us. We're living life and all of a sudden planes are crashing everywhere, destroying the largest buildings in New York City. Hitting the Pentagon. People were jumping out of windows. People all over the country had no idea what was happening. Were we being invaded? Were there going to be more attacks? Was someone you know there and were they ok? New York City was basically a war zone for the people who were there. 

So the feelings are not similar at all for the perspectives of the people who live in each country. If you had two similar scale events to 9/11 and the coronavirus happen in your country, I promise you wouldn't feel nearly the same about them. And I think comparing them is a massive downplay of the scale and effect of 9/11"

The deaths explicitly “due to” Covid19 **are** undercounted, but it’s because of the way that China lists mortality in every instance, not just this disease. For example, China has an insanely low number of deaths “due to” influenza, something obviously incorrect like 2,000 per year. It’s something to do with how they list cause of death as being due to pre-existing conditions someone might have when they enter the hospital, and it’s a well known quirk of China’s medical record system that makes it useless for calculating statistics but not evidence of a conspiracy for this particular disease."

blocks-long lines

 of residents seeking surgical masks and sanitisers have become the norm.

But a queue outside a farm? That would have been hard to imagine until about two weeks ago, when scores of people began flocking to a family farm in the New Territories town of Fanling.

“We have a lot of people here waiting, so please do not rush, we hope everyone is able to buy the vegetables they want today,” Becky Au Hei-man, 34, a third-generation farmer, told the queue of three dozen customers that snaked around Mapopo Community Farm last Sunday.

Driven by escalating fears amid the 

coronavirus outbreak

, which as of Saturday had seen 56 Hongkongers confirmed infected, panic-stricken residents have taken to emptying shelves of rice and toilet paper in major supermarkets in Hong Kong.

Fresh vegetables, meanwhile, though largely still available, have seen their prices soar.

￼

As fears around the virus first grew following the Lunar New Year holiday, produce prices jumped anywhere from 30 to 100 per cent, according to the government-backed Vegetable Marketing Organisation (VMO).

But while prices have come down as the initial panic subsided, they remain higher than in the first two weeks of January due to ongoing mark-ups on mainland produce, which accounts for the bulk of the city’s needs.

Enter Hong Kong’s local farms, which remain unaffected by the fluctuations.

The sudden price competitiveness has brought a sudden surge of new customers for local produce, which currently accounts for less than 1.7 per cent of the city’s supply, according to figures in 2017 by the Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation Department.

Locally grown vegetables have historically sold for 20 to 30 per cent more than mainland produce, and what local produce is available has typically been sold to wholesalers through the VMO, with very little going directly from farm to consumer.

“Local farm products are always more expensive and less convenient to buy, so I did not think of buying it before. But now, even vegetables from the mainland are expensive, so that makes local vegetables more appealing,” said Tiff Cheung, who arrived with her husband and 3-year-old daughter 30 minutes before the twice-weekly farmers’ market opened.Ms Ma, a regular customer who lives in Ho Man Tin and travels an hour to Mapopo farm to buy vegetables every Sunday, said she has taken to arriving 45 minutes before the market opens because of all the new faces.

“If I do not come early, I will be left with very little to choose from,” she said.

“Usually the week following the end of the Lunar New Year is a slow season for the farming industry. It was so shocking, because we were not expecting this at all,” said Au, who runs the farm.Just an hour after their farmers market opened on Sunday, two-thirds of their produce was sold.

“The popularity is surreal to us. We have tried hard to promote sustainable local farming and the importance for Hong Kong to have its own agricultural supply, and suddenly it seems like people have all caught up and realised how important these issues we have been talking about all along are,” Au said.

You and your war mongering wanna be a gang did not wish to answer my question, which you did eventually with a very long writing and finally said yes the virus can travel within the Waikiki ocean water to a limit and infect others nearby. You still want to just keep bashing and write hatred. Why? You are scared that this will chase visitors away, which is what Chinese government have done exactly in their early stages of the coronavirus until it got out of control.

Now you have decided that you feel upset about having given an answer, which you feel you have been tricked into, and now you are trying to soften a bit to see if you can wash if off. But as you must admit you can not change your answer. Hence you are thrashing out with your temper tantrum, which is very childish. 
Just look at it this way. If the Hawaii politicians were more strict and make it very hard for the coronavirus to be brought into Hawaii, then yes we would lose some visitors in the beginning. However, when all other travel destinations get hit with the coronavirus Hawaii will be in much demand and the visitors with money will be more than willing to go through the extra tough checking policy to come to Hawaii, which would be a safe haven as compared to everywhere else. Work towards the long run instead of the short gain.

You're incorrect. I don't think you really understand the subtle distinctions that are made in the article and the types of PPE out there.

From the article that you linked:

> There is some evidence to suggest the masks can help prevent  hand-to-mouth transmissions, but virologists are sceptical about their  effectiveness against airborne viruses. 

14 days ago there was no evidence to suggest the pathogen was airborne. We simply aren't seeing the infection/spread of the pathogen if it were airborne.

14 days ago, experts (I don't know their qualifications) [agreed with this assessment](https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/ewwmem/have_a_question_about_the_2019_novel_coronavirus/fg62ha8?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x).

Furthermore,

>Respirators and surgical masks are widely used in healthcare settings.  Both types of personal protective equipment (PPE) can be used for  infection control; however, only respirators can be used for respiratory  protection against airborne chemical hazards. 

and

>In comparison, a surgical mask only provides barrier protection against  large-particle droplets and does not effectively filter inhaled small  particles, fumes, or vapors. 

[https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/healthcarehsps/respiratory.html](https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/healthcarehsps/respiratory.html)

Also

>Typical surgical masks usually found at pharmacies (and which were  sold out on Amazon and other e-tailers as of Friday) are approved by the  U.S. Food and Drug Administration to protect the wearer against large  droplets or splashes of bodily and infected fluids from others,  according to the CDC.   
>  
>Wearing surgical masks does not prevent a person from  inhaling smaller airborne particles; they are not considered  respiratory protection by the CDC. Surgical masks are also loose  fitting, and when the wearer inhales, there is potential for particles  to leak in or out of the sides.

I will see the doctor again tomorrow since I am still not better, and expect that I will be tested. This experience matches what I am reading in the news: infected people have a ~1 week period of mild symptoms before getting tested. Nobody knows what fraction of people get better before even getting tested. Long story short, in a first world country like Singapore confirmed cases at best lack 1-2 weeks behind actually cases, and actual cases may well be an unknown factor larger than confirmed cases.

Countries like India, Indonesia, Phillipines, Bangladesh all have close contact with Singapore, with many foreigners from those countries working or visiting here, and vice versa. The induction period for the virus is fairly long, about a week, followed by a week of mild symptoms. There is no way the virus is not spreading in those countries - it is definitely a diagnostic issue."

That being said, if you are not enjoying a game because of any reason, my personal suggestion would be to play something else in the meantime and check back in periodically to see if anything has changed. I do that myself with many games if there is something causing me not to enjoy them temporarily.

Health officials expected to order anyone with the sniffles to 'self-isolate' at home if the virus is not contained

Anyone suffering flu-like symptoms could be ordered to “self-isolate” for a fortnight if the number of coronavirus cases in the UK hits the hundreds, in what would be a dramatic shift in Government strategy.

Over the last week, hospitals across the country have created “isolation pods,” to ensure that anyone tested for the virus is kept away from other patients, with efforts to track all close contacts of confirmed cases.

But The Telegraph understands that after a series of high- level meetings health officials are expected to change tack - and simply order anyone with possible symptoms of flu to stay at home - if the virus is not contained.

That means millions of Britons with coughs and colds could end up quarantined at home, as part of attempts to dampen down spread of the virus.

It comes as a Chinese tourist visiting France became the first person to die of coronavirus in Europe and another GP surgery was shut in England.

Eight out of the nine people in Britain to have contracted the virus to date have now recovered and left hospital following treatment. 

The five members of a ski group infected by Steve Walsh - the businessman at the centre of the UK outbreak - have said they had recovered quickly.

Writing in The Sunday Telegraph, Dominic Raab, the Foreign Secretary, today called for more international cooperation to prevent Coronavirus turning into a global pandemic.

The Telegraph understands that senior managers have been told that the NHS could stop testing patients once around 100 cases have been confirmed across the country, if there is evidence of “sustained transmission” within the UK.

The WHO advises countries to carry out a detailed investigation of at least the first 100 confirmed cases of any pandemic.

Britain’s Pandemic Influenza Response Plan sets out protocols for ensuring isolation and treatment for “the first few 100 cases” so that detailed information can be gathered about any novel virus.

But it says the approach should be changed as soon as there is “evidence of sustained community transmission of the virus, ie cases not linked to any known or previously identified cases.”

The health service is already struggling to cope with the number of tests for the virus it is carrying out.

In the last week, the number tested has quadrupled with 2,992 now carried out, up from 686 a week ago. 

The NHS has the capacity to carry out 1,000 tests a day, but on Thursday alone, it carried out 763 tests.

Prof Chris Whitty, England’s chief medical officer, has said the current approach aims to contain and delay the spread of the virus as much as possible in order to “buy time” while treatments and vaccines are researched. 

But if there are cases of onward transmission in this country , and it becomes sustained, the strategy will shift to “mitigation” as the NHS would not be able to cope with vast numbers of patients undergoing tests.

If large numbers fall ill, but suffer mild symptoms, sending them to hospital, when isolation could not be maintained, would increase the risk of spreading the disease among the vulnerable.

The Foreign Secretary said the British government is helping the World Health Organisation to train rapid response teams and local emergency medics in Asia and Africa to fight the virus and has donated £5 million to the WHO’s Flash Appeal to stop its spread.

Experts say if the situation becomes a pandemic, 60 percent of the population could get the virus - and up to 400,000 people might die. 

However, officials stress that it is still possible that the UK could avoid sustained transmission.

One NHS manager in London said services were struggling to cope with demand for tests, with staff spending hours waiting to ensure those undergoing the checks remained in isolation, with ambulances used to ferry them home. She said hospitals were “overwhelmed” by demand to keep up with tests, with nurses being warned that they may have to test people in their homes in future. 

On Thursday, the head of NHS England Sir Simon Stevens warned that many more people may be forced to self-isolate as part of efforts to stop Coronavirus spreading in Britain.

Prof Neil Ferguson, professor of mathematical biology at Imperial College, has warned that the world is “in the early phases of a global pandemic”.  

He said Britain is probably only picking up around one in three cases, focusing on those coming in to the country, when cases may have arrived - and gone undetected - before restrictions set in.

“Surveillance has started in hospitals across the UK of pneumonia cases, that will give us a proper picture,” he said.

“Our best estimate is that transmission in the UK will get going in the next few weeks; unless we are very lucky probably peaking 2 to 3 months after that,” he said. “If it truly establishes itself in terms of true person-to-person transmission it will behave like a flu pandemic, maybe up to 60 percent of the population being affected but most of those people having very mild symptoms.”

He suggested that 400,000 people in the UK could die from it in the next 12 months, based on estimates of a 1 per cent mortality rate and an infection rate of 60 percent of the population.

The 80-year-old Chinese man who died from the virus in France flagged himself up to doctors soon after arriving in France on January 16, but they initially failed to recognise his symptoms as the Covid-19 Coronavirus. 

The man had been receiving treatment in the Bichat-Claude Bernard hospital, northern Paris. His daughter is also in hospital but French authorities say she is likely to make a good recovery. 

In Portsmouth the Kingston Crescent Surgery became the latest to shut for deep cleaning until further notice on Friday after a woman suspected to have the virus walked in after falling ill.

The woman is said to have felt unwell some time after arriving in Britain at Gatwick Airport.

The closure is the latest to hit a string of surgeries and health centres around the country, including Islington in north London and Taunton in Somerset, after being attended by patients with suspected Coronavirus.

At the same time the last of those quarantined at Arrowe Park, in the Wirral, after returning from China have now been allowed home.

Mr Walsh, a 53-year-old Scout leader from Hove in East Sussex, contracted Coronavirus on a business trip to Singapore and on his way back stopped off at a ski resort in France, where five other Britons were subsequently infected.

In a statement the group, who were treated at the Royal Free Hospital and St Thomas' Hospital in London, said: ""All of our group, including the six in other countries, have recovered quickly from the virus having required minimal medical treatment during our time in isolation.

""We understand the virus can be dangerous for some, but we also want to share the important facts of our situation to help reassure people.""

Health Secretary Matt Hancock said: “I am pleased that 8 of the 9 individuals who tested positive for Coronavirus have now been successfully treated and discharged from hospital. Again, this is evidence of how well prepared our NHS is to deal with the Wuhan Coronavirus.

 “I want to stress that any individuals who are discharged from hospital are now well and do not pose any public health risk to the public.”"

Not sure how you arrived at your number, but I think it's actually higher than that. The number of people in cities that are in ""lockdown"" are, to my understanding, just the ones officially announced by the Chinese government at the national level. I am in contact with many people from all over China. I have been asking constantly for the last 3 weeks, and I don't think there is a single place in China where people are moving freely right now. It's my understanding that although only select cities are on ""lockdown"" officially, there's not a damn place in China that's not on lockdown of some sort, be it form the city, provice, or national level. I'd say all 1.4 billion people in China are under moderate to heavy house arrest. This, too, never makes the news. So yeah, when something is this big and is this lightly covered, I get suspicious.   


The situation in China is totally opaque to most people living in China, and to most of the outside world. If more people were aware that a country of 1.4 billion has not been able to leave their homes for anything other than the bare necessities for about the last 3 weeks, I believe that more of the world would pay attention.   


Also, note that the rhetoric is changing. There have been recent ""leaks"" revealing that the numbers in China may be higher than we've been told (duh!)  like  [https://www.cnbc.com/2020/02/13/white-house-does-not-have-high-confidence-in-chinas-coronavirus-information-official-says.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/02/13/white-house-does-not-have-high-confidence-in-chinas-coronavirus-information-official-says.html)

Here are my reasons for why I believe Black Widow will make a billion and not Wonder Woman 1984:

1. More views for Black Widow’s first trailer  on YouTube than Wonder Woman 1984’s first trailer (40 million compared to WW84’s 26M viewers trailer) and the only
trailer for a 2020 movie to go over 40 million views, the threshold usually needed to be crossed in order for a billion dollar film to be likely. Plus, has more likes on YouTube with 1.5 million compared to WW84’s 583 thousand likes.

2. BW has had more marketing in it’s first three months (a first trailer in December, a special look and featurette during the ESPN NFC game in January, and a Big Game Super Bowl spot this current February) than WW84 (a first trailer in December and a Super Bowl spot that turned into a Tide ad). Plus, the Black Widow trailer has 207 thousand retweets compared to WW84’s 107 thousand retweets on Twitter. So, clearly that shows which of the two female led Marvel movies has more hype.

3. BW is being eventized as the start of the next post-Avengers phase (like Iron Man 3 and Captain America: Civil War were) and next era of the MCU post-Endgame.

4. It’ll attract Netflix fans with David Harbour, which got fans talking with Red Guardian and the Stranger Things Season 4 trailer with Hopper in Russia, and Disney+ fans with a special look at the movie on their service with some upcoming Disney+ release of theirs.

5. It’ll get an entirely global start (not counting China, if the CoronaVirus Crisis doesn’t get solved in time) over the first weekend of May, meaning they are trying hard to keep spoilers in bound until everyone around the world sees it, which will likely play into it opening huge, meaning it could play like Iron Man 3 or Black Panther making a billion without China before they opened in China.

6. The first Wonder Woman didn’t hit a billion with China and got banned in Lebanon because of Gal being Israeli, something that is likely to be repeated with Wonder Woman 1984.

6. Less competion for Black Widow (Scoob, The Woman in The Window) until Memorial Day Weekend with F9: The Fast Saga compared to the competion WW84 has to face a week later (Candyman, Disney and Pixar’s Soul, In The Heights and Top Gun: Maverick). And, with BW being a female-led film that could help it have a smaller drop over Mother’s Day Weekend, compared to Iron Man 3 and Cap 3.

7. It’s gonna get two more straight months of marketing with a final trailer, final poster, ticket presales following the trailer and a likely early premiere at CinemaCon at the end of March, before it’s world premiere sometime in April. So, you Disney’s gonna market the crap out of it to build more hype for people to see it.

8. That’s it."

Regarding reinfection:

TL;DR: Even where reinfection is possible, in the close cousin of SARS-CoV2, SARS-CoV, there is an immune response which [reduces viral load,](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/corecgi/tileshop/tileshop.fcgi?p=PMC3&id=689135&s=32&r=1&c=1) and [prevents the same respiratory inflammation](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/corecgi/tileshop/tileshop.fcgi?p=PMC3&id=689159&s=32&r=1&c=1) that SARS-CoV normally provokes, so a reinfection –when it does happen- while a patient still has antibodies is less severe and produces less symptoms. Those antibodies can persist for immune responses to coronaviruses past the pandemic, incidentally, although may not be effective for as long as a number of years or more, depending on the antibody and the individual. Although you couldn't guarantee this will be the case with SARS-CoV2, the likelihood is high due to the number of shared proteins both of these coronaviruses have, and the (as far as we are currently aware,) shared pathologic activity of SARS-CoV/SARS-CoV2.

**Are there any published papers or clinical investigations which have specifically studied reinfection of SARS-CoV2?**

No.

**What information might be relevant to reinfection mechanisms of SARS-CoV2?**

Varying coronaviruses have differing incidences and severity of reinfection. In saying anything about 2019-nCov, its important to discuss closely related viruses, which have large numbers of the same proteins (because the proteins determine the activity of the virus.)

**Which is the coronavirus most closely related to SARS-CoV2?**

The various host-specific SARS coronaviruses are closest ([Lancet,2020](https://archive.is/tzhOd).)  Two bat-host variants are slightly closer, but the human SARS-CoV is only marginally less so.  MERS is next closest (but far more divergent than any of the SARS variants.)

**What papers are there regarding reinfection of (human) SARS-CoV?**

Due to the limiting ethical issues of inducing reinfection in humans, there is [an animal study which examines the infection and reinfection of SARS-CoV in ferrets.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3454321)  Ferrets are suitable since they have mammalian physiology, and are susceptible to, and have an equivalent clinical pathologic reaction to SARS-CoV.

**What is the study design of the SARS-CoV reinfection experiment?**

>Here ferrets were assigned to three treatment groups for this study: (A) a mock infection control group, (B) a single infection group, and (C) a group that was infected at the same time as group B, then subsequently reinfected 29 days later. The infected groups were innoculated intranasally (IN) with 103 50% tissue culture infective dose (TCID50 unit per ml) of SARS-CoV TOR2 strain, while the mock infected animals received intranasal instillation of vehicle (serum-free cell culture medium (SFM)).

>Ferrets were monitored for clinical signs of disease twice daily. The most significant symptom observed in SARS-CoV infected animals was sneezing, which was observed in one third of the infected ferrets between 4 and 11 days post-infection (DPI). Sneezing was not observed in ferrets from the control group (A), nor in group (C) at any time post- reinfection.

It should be noted that, like in humans, that healthy non-immunocompromised individuals have a typically less pronounced reaction to respiratory pathogens, however, clinically significant inflammatory tissue responses (I.E. histopathology) are present in respiratory surfaces, regardless of the severity, during an infection, with measurable viral load.

**Is there an effective immune system response to reinfection of SARS-CoV?**

There is a significant normative immune system response, however the response can be incomplete.  That is to say that SARS-CoV-specific antibodies are appropriately generated as an immune response to infection by SARs-CoV, and reinfection provokes a spike in production of those SARS-CoV antibodies.

([See chart indicating Mean levels of serum neutralizing antibody to SARS-CoV]( https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/corecgi/tileshop/tileshop.fcgi?p=PMC3&id=689129&s=32&r=1&c=1))

Immune response, like any other biologic process, relies on proteins to act. While a typical immunity to a pathogen would involve the same primary mechanism, of a spike in antibodies, there are a number of other proteins which act to respond to an infection after the neutralizing antibody has bound to the pathogen. The activity of a number of these proteins can be variable (which in protein expression is termed as upregulation and downregulation) in the immune response of different individuals, in their immune response to SARS-CoV, most notably a downregulation of the type I interferon Response Gene ([see a discussion of IFN, here.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4084561))

Downregulation of a gene does not mean absence of that protein, but instead, fewer proteins, and there are a number of pathways by which the body responds to pathogens. A downregulation in expression of IRG does, however mean a less intense or complete immune response.  Certain symptoms may be absent, and those that do exist can be lessened in such a case.

**What clinical differences are there between infection and post-infection pathology in SARS-CoV?**

* [Viral load is decreased below primary infection levels in immune-mediated reinfections]( https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/corecgi/tileshop/tileshop.fcgi?p=PMC3&id=689135&s=32&r=1&c=1)

* [There is visible and clinically significant reduction of histopathology (I.E. cell disease) in immune-mediated reinfection]( https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/corecgi/tileshop/tileshop.fcgi?p=PMC3&id=689159&s=32&r=1&c=1)  Note the similarity of the uninfected tissue (A) to the reinfected tissue (C)."

By ""on its own"" I meant without a primary disease causing it, such as this new coronavirus.  

>Regardless, I don't see how that defends your original point of it being ""far more severe than pneumonia""

If a disease can cause a bunch of different symptoms, with pneumonia being one of them, it's clearly more severe than pneumonia on its own.  

Things that make this particular disease far more worrying than primary pneumonia are its high infectivity, novelty, damage to other organs, potentially much more severe symptoms on refinfection, incubation period, and there are plenty more."

Outside of Wuhan and the surrounding areas, the disease hasn't really reached the area where I live except for 1 or 2 isolated cases. At this moment, it really feels like the government would prefer to be overcautious than not cautious enough. Only time will tell if it worked at all and when the quarantine will be over. 

I can only speak for my apartment community, but here are some of our rules during the quarantine.

1. When outside, you MUST wear a mask, even if it's just to take out the trash.
2. If you leave the community, there is only one gate and you must take your temperature when coming back in.
3. Deliveries (from Taobao, [JD.com](https://JD.com), etc.) can only be picked up from the front gates at noon.
4. You can only exit the apartment community every other day, at least by car. (Very few people are taking this option, even if they can)
5. The front gate is open only from, like 8 am to 8 pm, so there's a curfew in place.
6. You are ""obligated"" to tell the community leaders if you know of anyone that has been to Wuhan or the infected zones (yup, authoritarian government for you).

People are really praying for Wuhan right now. I've also seen some open criticism of the government of WeChat, which is something I had NEVER before seen. I'm curious how the coronavirus outbreak will change the Chinese government (if it does at all) and there's been a stronger push, at least among my circle of Chinese contacts, for higher transparency and visibility.

TLDR; shit's scary, but also boring."

Currently just looking for confirmation of this in places, so today saw an article about ACE2 receptors being more prevalent in Asian populations, which Coronavirus uses.

So the virus likely has spread in other places more and isn't affecting a lot of people. Remember, it is also winter, people get sick all the time. It is difficult to screen if nobody is dying in concentrated areas."

With that said, I guarantee theres some kind of funny business going on with the coronavirus. I dont know if they're just testing the susceptibility of the masses or what. Somethings not right. It's like they're trying to cause panic. Maybe theyre trying to force trump into trying to calm the masses down? Maybe theyre priming people for a bio attack? Maybe its collaboration with tesla to sell more of his bio defense cars?  Maybe they know that america WANTS a conspiracy so they are giving them exactly what they want and at the end of it it's all for their own good?

Maybe it's just raising awareness to issues that are very real but most people dont want to be bothered by because it dosent affect them?

Could I pick your brain - 

The founders had also just started doing interviews with different training designers across different institutions to understand what are their key challenges to engagement. Similar to what everyone on this thread had shared, the first interviewee pointed out that it wasn't so much as engagement issues and she felt it might just be vanity metrics for the training company. 

Instead the current challenges she shared were:

 \- Pre-class: is there was a better way to filter the participants so that they can be grouped by their learning styles/needs?

\-  Post- class: which metric to use/how to assess the course/program's impact on the attendees? 

\-  During class: Can blended/hybrid learning program be able to recreate a vulnerable space for participants to share reflections or carry out activities intended to get them out of their comfort zone? (This coming in the wake of the outbreak of the coronavirus in Asia which meant trainings have to include online options as organizations try to minimize group gatherings.) 

Do any of these challenges also resonate with you (everyone on the thread)? Thought I'd throw it out here to see if it does."

Let's see. CN rail is going to need a bailout. Air Canada, too. Bombardier is in the toilet. GM (in Canada) is in tough waters after their last strike. We have numerous strikes over the pay freezes across Canada for a half decade, during 'prosperous' times. Those people are going to have to negotiate a roll back on their wages pretty soon.

Our cannabis sector is collapsing. Some companies may not even make it to 4/20. 

There's supply chain issues rippling through the economy due to the shut down of China. Those are being exacerbated by the blockade of CN rail. Via rail shut down, impacting the livelihoods of thousands of commuters. 

Lowes shutting down stores across Canada. Hudson Bay bought out (more for Saks than anything else). Bench and a bunch of other mall brands have been disappearing. 

Canada's consumer insolvencies hit the second-highest ever in 2019, only behind 2008..

Impending grocery shortages. Impending energy shortages. 

Even Tim Hortons, which for some reason people hadn't ditched despite its dramatic plunge in quality for the past decade+, is struggling.

And let's hope that the coronavirus doesn't take hold here. We haven't shut down flights with China. No quarantines. Hardly any screening. Considering some people don't show symptoms for up to 24 days, there's potential things get out of hand. Then a potential 3+ weeks of someone being sick. And if they are in critical condition, much of that time is spent on a ventilator. We don't have enough ventilators in Canada to deal with a crisis of any scale. Listening to the WHO updates before they were allowed in China vs after is haunting. 

We're going to have a fucking massive deficit this year."

Annually 291,000-646,000 people die of flu. Let's take the smaller number to be conservative. The coronavirus outbreak started on 1st December 2019, 76 days ago. 

(76/365) * 291,000 = 60,591

So we can reasonably assume that at least 60,000 people died of regular flu since the outbreak started.

The latest death toll for coronavirus is around 1,400 people. This is 2.31% of the deaths from regular flu.

This means that, as things currently stand, all of the measures to limit the spread of the disease would only have to be 2.31% effective or higher to result in a net reduction in deaths. If everything that is being done is only reducing cases by 2.31%, that seems almost pointless to me. I would hope that it's much higher.

It's difficult to find accurate statistics for deaths per km driven for all countries but the best I can find is about 5 deaths per million km.

If we just look at China, there are 200 million school-age children. Let's imagine that they all travel 1km in busses of 20 students to and from school. That means 20,000,000km driven per day, which on average should result in 100 deaths. Schools will have been closed for a month so that's 20 school days or 2,000 deaths. This is already more than the coronavirus deaths. And that's just China. Schools and businesses have been closed in Vietnam, Hong Kong, and Taiwan.

There are a lot of assumptions in the above numbers but I can't help but think that there will be fewer deaths this year, compared to the average, as a result of the measures taken to contain the coronavirus."

Right now (in my very own opinion, huge grain of salt and all that) if you have mild maybe-coronavirus symptoms, it's probably better for *you* to stay at home and self isolate, rather than go to hospital and risk getting infected from someone else when you don't have it.

 Com rebaixamentos pontuais em algumas previsões, um crescimento ao redor de 2% em 2020 já é encarado por parte do mercado mais como alvo do que como piso.

 Os dois maiores bancos privados do país, Itaú Unibanco e Bradesco, no entanto, [mantêm por enquanto suas estimativas](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/mercado/2020/02/surto-na-china-muda-projecoes-de-pib-para-o-brasil-em-2020.shtml): 2,2% e 2,5%, respectivamente. Mas o viés é de leve baixa no caso do Itaú Unibanco.

 Embora a taxa geral de desemprego tenda a permanecer elevada, [ao redor de 11%](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/mercado/2020/01/taxa-de-desemprego-de-2019-termina-em-11.shtml), a expectativa é de formalização mais acelerada das vagas hoje precárias, com impactos positivos na renda e na confiança dos consumidores.

  Na contramão, persiste a incerteza [em relação à indústria](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/mercado/2020/02/apos-dois-anos-em-alta-industria-recua-11-em-2019.shtml) e, consequência disso, a falta de uma retomada mais[ firme nos investimentos produtivos](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/mercado/2020/02/retracao-no-ano-passado-deixa-industria-mais-distante-de-seu-pico-em-2011.shtml) —adiados diante da elevada capacidade ociosa.

 Sobre esse panorama pairam dúvidas a respeito do equilíbrio das [contas públicas](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/mercado/2020/01/contas-publicas-encerram-2019-com-rombo-de-r-95-bilhoes.shtml) e da [agenda de reformas neste ano](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/mercado/2020/02/articulacao-falha-e-verborragia-de-guedes-ameacam-agenda-economica.shtml) eleitoral, mais curto para o Congresso.

 A falta de definição até agora do que será prioritário na pauta ([PEC da Emergência Fiscal](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/mercado/2020/02/senadores-querem-dividir-onus-de-pec-emergencial-com-estados-e-municipios.shtml), reforma administrativa ou[ tributária](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/mercado/2020/02/guedes-propoe-compensar-estados-que-tiverem-perdas-com-reforma-tributaria.shtml)) já é vista em alguma medida como a repetição da desordem política do ano passado, que acabou afetando o crescimento.

 Mais otimista entre bancos e consultorias ouvidos pela** Folha**, o Bradesco manteve a previsão de 2,5% para o PIB apoiado em dois pilares: recuperação do emprego formal e aumento do crédito.

 Segundo Fernando Honorato, economista-chefe do banco, a melhora do mercado de trabalho neste momento, levando em conta séries históricas, é compatível com um PIB até mais forte.

 “É cedo para qualquer revisão, e encaramos os dados um pouco mais fracos no fim do ano como ruídos. O emprego formal vem superando bem nossas expectativas”, diz.

 Sobre uma eventual desaceleração externa causada [pelos impactos do ](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/mercado/2020/02/coronavirus-ameaca-cadeia-global-de-suprimentos.shtml)[coronavírus](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/mercado/2020/02/coronavirus-ameaca-cadeia-global-de-suprimentos.shtml), Honorato diz que haveria algum espaço adicional para o Banco Central cortar mais o juro básico, [hoje em 4,25% ao ano](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/mercado/2020/02/copom-reduz-taxa-basica-de-juros-para-425-ao-ano.shtml).

 Para Luka Barbosa, economista sênior do Itaú Unibanco, os dados mais fracos do fim de 2019 vieram dentro das expectativas do banco. 

 O IBC-Br (Índice de Atividade Econômica do Banco Central) caiu 0,27% em dezembro na comparação dessazonalizada com o mês anterior. Foi influenciado pelas quedas de 0,7% na produção industrial, de 0,1% no varejo (-0,8% no varejo ampliado, que inclui veículos, motos, peças e material de construção) e de 0,4% nos serviços. 

 No ano, o crescimento verificado pelo BC foi de 0,89%, abaixo do 1,34% de 2018.

 “Esperávamos isso [a queda de dezembro] em razão da diminuição dos [efeitos da liberação do FGTS](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/mercado/2019/12/saque-extra-de-ate-r-498-do-fgts-esta-liberado-nesta-sexta-feira.shtml). São dados voláteis, assim como o próprio PIB em sua sequência trimestral. Não acho que a história da recuperação esteja mudando.”

 O economista ressalta que não há estímulos fiscais (gastos públicos) ou um boom de preços de commodities ajudando o crescimento neste momento, o que torna a recuperação “mais moderada; porém, mais saudável”.

 Mesmo em relação à indústria, sua expectativa é de paulatina recuperação após o tombo de 6% nas exportações de manufaturados em 2019 por causa das tensões entre Estados Unidos e China e da[ crise na Argentina](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/mercado/2019/05/exportacao-de-carros-cai-45-no-primeiro-quadrimestre-puxada-por-crise-argentina-diz-anfavea.shtml).

 Para o economista Fabio Klein, da Tendências, é cedo para determinar se os dados menos favoráveis de dezembro vão se repetir. Indicadores de janeiro relativos à produção de papelão ondulado (para caixas e embalagens) e o tráfego de veículos pesados apontam para “um certo otimismo”.

 A Tendências manteve a sua previsão de 2,1% de alta do PIB, apoiada no aumento do volume do crédito. Haveria, assim, impactos positivos no consumo e na construção civil, com reflexos favoráveis no emprego.

 Klein não vislumbra influência acentuada do coronavírus na economia brasileira. “O efeito pode ser temporário na receita de setores como soja, minério de ferro e petróleo.”

 Em janeiro, segundo dados da FGV/Ibre, a confiança avançou em todos os setores, exceto serviços (-0,1 ponto). O destaque foi a construção, com trajetória ascendente desde o segundo semestre de 2019. 

 Por esses indicadores, a indústria passou a melhorar no quarto trimestre de 2019 e inicia o ano em uma zona de neutralidade.

 Já a confiança do comércio se mantém na faixa entre 95 e 100 pontos desde julho de 2019, sugerindo que uma recuperação mais consistente dependerá do mercado de trabalho e da confiança dos consumidores.

 Para Tony Volpon, economista-chefe do banco UBS, houve um “excesso de otimismo” no final de 2019 que não se confirmou. Na primeira semana de fevereiro, a instituição financeira já havia cortado de 2,5% para 2,1% sua previsão para o PIB deste ano.

 “Foi mais em razão do coronavírus e da China. Mas 0,4 ponto percentual a menos não quer dizer muita coisa. Esperamos para ver, pois parece mais uma acomodação, não uma reversão de tendência.”

 O UBS aponta para uma dicotomia no momento: crédito, consumo e emprego melhores e indústria retardando a retomada. Sobretudo pela queda das importações da Argentina e da atividade da Vale —cuja produção de minério de ferro encolheu 21,5% em 2019 após o acidente em Brumadinho (MG).

 A MB Associados mantém sua previsão de crescimento em 2% para este ano e aposta em uma evolução relativamente lenta ao longo do tempo, com um 2021 melhor e assim por diante. “Os estragos do passado foram muito grandes”, diz Sérgio Vale, economista-chefe da consultoria.

 Inflação e juros baixos são apontados como fatores positivos, assim como o crédito em alta, a melhora no emprego formal e o aumento da massa de rendimentos —todos elementos que tendem a estimular o consumo. 

 O obstáculo continua localizado na indústria e na falta de investimentos para ampliar sua capacidade.

 “No geral, nunca compramos muito o otimismo de alguns do mercado. Agora, há quem coloque o coronavírus como ‘bode na sala’ para justificar um corte nas expectativas”, diz Vale. Mesmo que a epidemia [afete o comércio Brasil-China](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/mercado/2020/02/coronavirus-trava-novos-negocios-entre-brasil-e-china.shtml), diz, o estrago tende a ser passageiro.

 José Francisco de Lima Gonçalves, economista-chefe do Fator, afirma que o banco já considera rebaixar de 2,2% para “um teto” de 2% a previsão de crescimento do PIB neste ano.

 Sua equipe detectou, em janeiro, queda tanto nas vendas de maquinário para o setor agrícola quanto para o elétrico.

 A avaliação de Gonçalves é a de que um clima de “insegurança política” na relação (e na pauta) do governo com o Congresso vem ganhando peso como fator de incerteza na área fiscal. Assim como a “insegurança jurídica” contamina expectativas em relação às concessões de obras que ajudariam a deslanchar alguns investimentos.

 Nessa área, o Ministério da Infraestrutura vem mantendo a previsão de ofertar 44 obras neste ano e de concluir outras 52 —o que alguns consideram metas ambiciosas demais.

 “Não há dúvida conceitual ou empírica de que precisamos de mais investimentos para sairmos do ciclo de baixo crescimento”, diz.

 No time dos mais otimistas, o economista-chefe da Genial Investimentos e professor da PUC-Rio, José Márcio Camargo, segue ap"

Ultraviolet lamps, which pump UV rays into the skin, will not sterilise the skin.

They could, however, cause skin irritation, the WHO warned. 

Long term, UV radiation which also comes from the sun can damage the DNA in cells, which in turn may lead to cancer. It's for this reason that tanning beds are advised against.

It is a tragedy for the people of China. The Chinese government completely bungled this whole thing. It seems like most countries around the world had enough lead-time to jump on this and limit the spread, and handle the infected cases with the proper amount of high caution and attention as possible....  


But as the epicenter, it does not seem like China took it seriously enough or acted fast enough to prevent MASSIVE damage to their country. Not just to their population, it isn't purely about the amount of people who might die in China....but overall health of the population, the state of mind of the population....social unrest, political unrest, economic unrest....

Because unlike diseases that I mentioned above, we only 'know' COVID-19 for several months unlike those diseases which are known for many years, so we do not know enough yet and will not know until more data comes in. Unless we know it's as harmless as Influenzavirus, we will treat it as Ebola. It's like you are battling terrorist but you don't know if he is just a noob wielding Dual Barettas or a veteran-expert with G3SG1. Can't be too careful in case the new virus is another Spanish Flu of 1918-1919 after all.

The WHO actually only recommend surveillance and quarantine to prevent further spread until it could be studied further, but the public and government around the world overreacts (and Chinese gov reputation didn't help at all). The fact that Wuhan hospitals and health systems were overwhelmed by both infected and non-infected were not helping at all. I guess if everyone stay calmed and we moved the severe cases to bigger hospital we could reduce the death toll.

If you still remember 2009, most nation were also panicked when due to H1N1. Sadly Twitter, Youtube, and SocialMessenger Apps exists in 2020. And guess what, when H1N1 ended without bodies literally dropping on the street, many people criticized WHO because, ""the flu is not that deadly after all!"" Which is actually showed just how many people didn't really grasp the concept behind pandemic.

Also "" (yang mati cuma 2%),"" We also need to include people who actually have coronavirus, but only showed symptoms so mild, that they didn't appear to be infected at all (hence they might not be tested). If we consider the mild cases, in the best situation the death rate might below 1% of infected.

> Kalo ada yang kena flu umum atau dengue fever itu kan kita tidak ada isolasi segala, tidak ada karantina, tenaga medis yang menangani juga tidak menggunakan kostum biohazard.

Actually for influenza, there is quarantine. But people usually reply: ""Alah, cuma flu ini."" And would actually punch you if you try to restrain them. Dengue cases actually would mean that the entire local mosquito population around 100 meter of the patient's house to be purged, abatezation of entire clean water, and any fever patients for the last one week and for the next two week would need to get their blood tested. Two cases in a single neighborhood is a considered a dengue outbreak for Public Health. However, the laypeople usually didn't realize this. For Public Health doctors, any cases of Influenza and Dengue are actually a very big deal. It's the laypeople who didn't have the same view on it.

Every line in my comment are direct quotes from first-hand encounters at work. There is no exaggeration, and I'm not even blaming coronavirus for any of it. My comment is an example of how people around me give absolutely no sh\*ts about avoiding direct contact with other people, even though they themselves are in direct contact with known, sick people. Furthermore, my example with the young kid with the flu and bleeding is absolutely no exaggeration and was not marked with **/s** at all.

The kid, she described to me yesterday on our daily conference call, started bleeding from his nose and mouth at the doctor's office, who at the time ""didn't believe her when she told the doctor about the bloody noses he was getting this week.""

They sent him to the hospital, gave him an IV for a bit, and sent him home as soon as it stopped. He's been home all week, with the exception around Wednesday, his fever had been down for 24 hours, so she sent him to school. At 8:30am that same day, her school called and told her to pick him up, because he had a fever of 100.7 \*F, and has been getting worse.

Again, he was diagnosed with Flu B, but I've never heard of a case this horrific before from someone I personally know, and I am honestly worried considering both her and her kid went back into the public on Wednesday.

I understand not wanting to cause panic, but people need to really start caring about personal responsibility. The kid was in the ER over last weekend, sitting in the waiting room after he had a fever for the first time. I asked if she had put a mask on him while they were sitting in the waiting room with other people, and she just looked concerned as she realized, and said: ""No."""

1. You are in the wrong sub. For spreading the coronavirus seed, your neighbours would be honored there.

2. You think you are safe with MRE's and homemade masks? The coronavirus will have many ways to kill you once the panic grows. Especially a non believer like you.

3. r/coronavirus is a prohuman shithole. 

4. Who gives a care about the real numbers yet? The coronavirus is still as it's most basic stage. It didn't truly evolve yet, and is still lurking in many. The true number of deaths right now is too pitifull compared to the world population, I'm sure. The future is where it's at.

>But does it mean I'm going to die in the end?

Probably, but the coronavirus is benevolent, and might allow you to live. That is, if you begin to praise it as a god and encourage the many heroes spreading his will."

This is because the virus seems to be exceptionally good at infecting people with certain biology, which just coincidentally Ethnic Chinese people fit the biological profile of.  

It's one of the leading reasons why people think it is a bioweapon that got out of control.

&#x200B;

>He later talked about how if perhaps a Uighur person created the virus to kill only Chinese and released it in China, and how he would consider it completely justified, saying that the Chinese people would deserve it for not making an effort to stop the atrocities carried out by the CCP.

The CCP is currently farming the Uighur for live organ transplants.  This has been confirmed by multiple sources including an international tribunal.

That puts them on a level of evil not seen since WW2 Germany.  Arguably worse, due to the scale.

If Jews in WW2 Germany had released a bioweapon that targeted Germans, they would have probably been justified, too.

&#x200B;

>To have the opinion that killing off a nation of people for the atrocities of it's government seems a bit extreme, especially if the citizens really have no control or say in their governments actions.

But they do.  In the end, the only thing that will stop the CCP is China's people, other than if  they try some shit in the future and America beats the crap out of them for it.  (And yes, we'd beat the crap out of them.  China Numbah Won only exists on Communist Twitter threads.)

And don't forget that Scott believes that the CCP is responsible for killing his son.  His son was a fentanyl addict, and the CCP is allowing Chinese drug manufacturers to leak billions of dollars of illegal fentanyl into the US -- including the fentanyl that killed his kid.

> Mr. Li said that Mr. Ma, who with the others worked on installing water and electricity, was asymptomatic. Mr. Lin’s condition was not immediately known.

> China’s banks scramble to disinfect cash.

> The central banking authorities of China are disinfecting, stashing and reportedly even destroying cash in an effort to stop the spread of the coronavirus.

> Fan Yifei, deputy governor of the People’s Bank of China, said at a news conference on Saturday that the cash collected by commercial banks must be disinfected before being released back to customers.

> Cash collected from hospitals and food markets must be handled separately and disinfected before depositing the notes to the People’s Bank of China, Mr. Fan said. In severely hit regions, the collected cash must undergo ultraviolet or high-temperature disinfection and be stored for 14 days before going back to the market, he added. In less impacted areas, the bank notes must be disinfected and stored for a week before use."

When you take that into account, it's not really got ***anything*** to do with racism since there's nothing about their race that matters in that context.

Except the virus needs a living host to survive, that's why all cases have being linked to travelling and not to eating contaminated food. If it was really a genuine concern and based on the fear of the virus being imported, people should have stopped to buy stuff from China too right?

And even if somehow the virus would have contaminated the food (again, it's not a bacteria, it cannot survive without a living host more than a few hours), you'd only have to be afraid of raw food.

>  Obviously direct mistreatment to asians is racist, but calling being worried about eating at a chinese place racist is about as stupid as being worried about eating at a chinese place that's not even in china.

I'm not saying that those worried to eat at a Chinese restaurant are racists, but it is a mistreatment of someone that doesn't have the coronavirus based on their race/culture nonetheless and can be interpreted this way by those that are victims of it.

Some people are racists and are blaming Chinese because, for them, their way of living created the virus, others are misinformed and let their irrational fears mistreat Asians rather than searching for genuine information about it:

The virus may have (only?) killed about 1,100 (now 1,500+) worldwide and infected around a dozen in the United States, but most people haven't come into contact with it yet. And even if it's only half as deadly as the flu, its existence doesn't stop any of those other people from dying from the flu. We still have more deaths from deadly diseases now than we did to begin with, because we now have one more deadly disease than we had to begin with. 

Most people alive today have also been exposed to the flu at some point in their lives, so have a degree of immunity. That's not the case with the new virus. ""There remains deep uncertainty about the new coronavirus' mortality rate... but some estimates go as low as..."" Some of us aren't prepared to be the people who pay the price of presuming that uncertainty is going to work in their favour. I'll take being alive and permanently branded over-cautious over optimistic and dead any day of the week.

It's frustrating because it's dangerous. It serves the interests of those who stand to lose out due to your caution, at the expense of you and your community's health. Like vaccines, this isn't just about your own immunity and whether you're young and strong enough to battle it off. It's about the people you're going to pass it on to, who may not be, before you even realise you have it. The safest, most sensible and most rational thing for everyone to do right now is exercise a reasonable level of caution until the unknowns are knowns... not promote feel-good nonsense like this that just gives people a sense of reassurance while actually placing them more at risk."

Reynolds American, the North Carolina cigarette giant behind the Camel, Newport and Pall Mall brands, is infecting fast-growing tobacco plants with a genetically modified coronavirus to see if they can produce antibodies for a possible vaccine.



It’s a decades-old idea Reynolds tried with limited success during the Ebola crisis in 2015 and could offset declining cigarette sales, new tobacco age restrictions and a possible menthol ban. Public health experts say the experiment, if successful, could be scaled up quickly to respond to an international outbreak.














The Pentagon's medical research arm credited the use of tobacco plants in 2012 for the quick development of 10 million doses of flu vaccine. ""Plant-based solutions” could over time prove more effective than the typical process — growing a virus in eggs — said Alan Magill, program manager for the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency at the time, adding, “the research is very promising."""

1. Symptoms explained by Doctor ihttps://www.straitstimes.com/asia/east-asia/reporters-notebook-life-and-death-in-a-wuhan-coronavirus-icu: 

“I've observed that the breakout period of the novel coronavirus tends to be three weeks, from the onset of symptoms to developing difficulties breathing. Basically going from mild to severe symptoms takes about a week. There are all sorts of mild symptoms: feebleness, shortness of breath, some people have fevers, some don't. Based on studies of our 138 cases, the most common symptoms in the first stage are fever (98.6 per cent of cases), feebleness (69.6 per cent), cough (59.4 per cent), muscle pains (34.8 per cent), difficulties breathing (31.2%), while less common symptoms include headaches, dizziness, stomach pain, diarrhea, nausea, vomiting.

But some patients who enter the second week will suddenly get worse. At this stage, people should go to the hospital. The elderly with underlying conditions may develop complications; some may need machine-assisted respiration. When the body's other organs start to fail, that's when it becomes severe, while those with strong immune systems see their symptoms decrease in severity at this stage and gradually recover. So the second week is what determines whether the illness becomes critical.

The third week determines whether critical illness leads to death. Some in critical condition who receive treatment can raise their level of lymphocytes, a type of white blood cell, and see an improvement in their immune systems, and have been brought back, so to speak. But those whose lymphocyte numbers continue to decline, those whose immune systems are destroyed in the end, experience multiple organ failure and die.

For most, the illness is over in two weeks, whereas for those for whom the illness becomes severe, if they can survive three weeks, they're good. Those that can't will die in three weeks.”


2. And, this:

Symptom Progression Day 1 to Day 12 From
First Case of 2019 Novel Coronavirus in the United States 

35 year old male

https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2001191

On January 19, 2020, a 35-year-old man presented to an urgent care clinic in Snohomish County, Washington, with a 4-day history of cough and subjective fever. On checking into the clinic, the patient put on a mask in the waiting room. After waiting approximately 20 minutes, he was taken into an examination room and underwent evaluation by a provider. He disclosed that he had returned to Washington State on January 15 after traveling to visit family in Wuhan, China. The patient stated that he had seen a health alert from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) about the novel coronavirus outbreak in China and, because of his symptoms and recent travel, decided to see a health care provider....

Given the patient’s travel history, the local and state health departments were immediately notified. Together with the urgent care clinician, the Washington Department of Health notified the CDC Emergency Operations Center. Although the patient reported that he had not spent time at the Huanan seafood market and reported no known contact with ill persons during his travel to China, CDC staff concurred with the need to test the patient for 2019-nCoV on the basis of current CDC “persons under investigation” case definitions.8 Specimens were collected in accordance with CDC guidance and included serum and nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swab specimens. After specimen collection, the patient was discharged to home isolation with active monitoring by the local health department.
On January 20, 2020, the CDC confirmed that the patient’s nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabs tested positive for 2019-nCoV by real-time reverse-transcriptase–polymerase-chain-reaction (rRT-PCR) assay. In coordination with CDC subject-matter experts, state and local health officials, emergency medical services, and hospital leadership and staff, the patient was admitted to an airborne-isolation unit at Providence Regional Medical Center for clinical observation, with health care workers following CDC recommendations for contact, droplet, and airborne precautions with eye protection.

On admission, the patient reported persistent dry cough and a 2-day history of nausea and vomiting; he reported that he had no shortness of breath or chest pain. Vital signs were within normal ranges. On physical examination, the patient was found to have dry mucous membranes. The remainder of the examination was generally unremarkable. After admission, the patient received supportive care, including 2 liters of normal saline and ondansetron for nausea.


On days 2 through 5 of hospitalization (days 6 through 9 of illness), the patient’s vital signs remained largely stable, apart from the development of intermittent fevers accompanied by periods of tachycardia (Figure 2). The patient continued to report a nonproductive cough and appeared fatigued. On the afternoon of hospital day 2, the patient passed a loose bowel movement and reported abdominal discomfort. A second episode of loose stool was reported overnight; a sample of this stool was collected for rRT-PCR testing, along with additional respiratory specimens (nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal) and serum. The stool and both respiratory specimens later tested positive by rRT-PCR for 2019-nCoV, whereas the serum remained negative.

Treatment during this time was largely supportive. For symptom management, the patient received, as needed, antipyretic therapy consisting of 650 mg of acetaminophen every 4 hours and 600 mg of ibuprofen every 6 hours. He also received 600 mg of guaifenesin for his continued cough and approximately 6 liters of normal saline over the first 6 days of hospitalization.


A chest radiograph taken on hospital day 3 (illness day 7) was reported as showing no evidence of infiltrates or abnormalities (Figure 3). However, a second chest radiograph from the night of hospital day 5 (illness day 9) showed evidence of pneumonia in the lower lobe of the left lung (Figure 4). These radiographic findings coincided with a change in respiratory status starting on the evening of hospital day 5, when the patient’s oxygen saturation values as measured by pulse oximetry dropped to as low as 90% while he was breathing ambient air. On day 6, the patient was started on supplemental oxygen, delivered by nasal cannula at 2 liters per minute. Given the changing clinical presentation and concern about hospital-acquired pneumonia, treatment with vancomycin (a 1750-mg loading dose followed by 1 g administered intravenously every 8 hours) and cefepime (administered intravenously every 8 hours) was initiated.


On hospital day 6 (illness day 10), a fourth chest radiograph showed basilar streaky opacities in both lungs, a finding consistent with atypical pneumonia (Figure 5), and rales were noted in both lungs on auscultation. Given the radiographic findings, the decision to administer oxygen supplementation, the patient’s ongoing fevers, the persistent positive 2019-nCoV RNA at multiple sites, and published reports of the development of severe pneumonia3,4 at a period consistent with the development of radiographic pneumonia in this patient, clinicians pursued compassionate use of an investigational antiviral therapy. Treatment with intravenous remdesivir (a novel nucleotide analogue prodrug in development10,11) was initiated on the evening of day 7, and no adverse events were observed in association with the infusion. Vancomycin was discontinued on the evening of day 7, and cefepime was discontinued on the following day, after serial negative procalcitonin levels and negative nasal PCR testing for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus.

On hospital day 8 (illness day 12), the patient’s clinical condition improved. Supplemental oxygen was discontinued, and his oxygen saturation values improved to 94 to 96% while he was breathing ambient air. The previous bilateral lower-lobe rales were no longer present. His appetite improved, and he was asymptomatic aside from intermittent dry cough and rhinorrhea. 

As of January 30, 2020, the patient remains hospitalized. He is afebrile, and all symptoms have resolved with the exception of his cough, which is decreasing in severity.

Also, 'just saying it to weird her out', well that makes it soooo much better then, saying someone that they might die just as a joke on a plane just before take off as a joke.

Now if you still don't get it, it's like saying 'There is a Terrorist on the Subway/Underground train and the next station is not for a few minutes' or 'The brakes don't work on the bus so we are going to die... whoops' or 'the coronavirus is in our store'.

She was the first passenger on the MS Westerdam, operated by Carnival Corp unit Holland America Inc, to test positive for the virus.
The ship docked in the Cambodian port of Sihanoukville on Thursday carrying 1,455 passengers and 802 crew. It had spent two weeks at sea after being turned away by Japan, Taiwan, Guam, the Philippines and Thailand.
The passengers were tested regularly on board and Cambodia also tested 20 once it docked. None was found to have the new coronavirus that has killed more than 1,500 people, the vast majority in China.
The American woman flew to Malaysia on Friday from Cambodia along with 144 others from the ship, the Malaysian health ministry said in a statement, adding that she was in stable condition.
The woman’s husband had shown symptoms but tested negative, it said. The couple were the only ones of the 145 to show symptoms, the ministry said.

A spokesman for Holland America declined to comment.
Or Vandine, Secretary of State at Cambodia’s Health Ministry, also declined to comment.
U.S. President Donald Trump has thanked Cambodia for taking in the ship in a rare message to a country that is one of China’s closest allies and has often been at odds with Washington.
Cruise ships around Asia face widespread fears they may be spreading the virus. The biggest cluster outside China has been on the Diamond Princess, quarantined off Japan’s Yokohama. Out of about 3,700 passengers and crew on board, 285 people have tested positive and have been sent to hospital.
Vietnam turned back two ships on Friday.

The American woman’s case brings the total number of confirmed coronavirus cases in Malaysia to 22. (Reporting by A. Ananthalakshmi and Joseph Sipalan in Kuala Lumpur; Prak Chan Thul in Phnom Penh and Orathai Sriring in Bangkok; Editing by Nick Macfie)"

I live an hour from Travis and think it’s unfair they are putting such a big burden and risk on California and Texas like there aren’t 30 or so other states with Air Force bases. California has plenty of other problems without being the default dumping ground of people under coronavirus quarantine.

I love episodes like these that allow the girls to overcome their issues. In this case it was Reika's insecurities and unresolved frustration about her mother's death. I'm not sure if her father should be allowed within 100 yards of a school, but it was nice to see them bonding too. MVP of the ep was best girl Miu coming to cheer Reika on and give her the courage to get out there.

&#x200B;

I also think the episode brought up a really interesting topic, the sexualisation of idols, especially minor ones just to sell albums and merch. Really sad, but that's economics for ya. I can only imagine how uncomfortable many of them are made to feel.

&#x200B;

Really loving the series so far, about to be past the halfway point and it's been a great ride. wish it wasn't so slept on. I think it's a lot better than most of the other idol shows. It's certainly better than LoveLive's first season. First episode was a bit confusing which probably turned some people away. But the concept of the wall is something I like a lot.

If you are a typical chinese, you can only have one child, and the rest of your infants must be killed under the order of tartar communists. But if you are a tartar, you can have two and more children, admitted by the tartar communists and written in public laws ! ! !

Delhi health department officials have traced many of such passengers. According to data shared by the Delhi health department, till February 13, over 5,700 such passengers were approached after being informed by the Delhi airport authorities.

”As many as 4,707 passengers were found asymptomatic and advised for home isolation (self-quarantined). Seventeen patients were found symptomatic and hospitalised,” a senior official of the Delhi health department saidThe number of passengers, who remain untraced stands at 817, the official said, quoting the data collated by the health department.
The number of passengers pending surveillance stands at 68, according to the data.

In Delhi, of the 4,705 passengers found asymptomatic, a maximum of 1,249 of those were residents of West Delhi district, while 1,073 people lived in Central Delhi.
The Delhi government has already set up a centralised control room at DGHS (HQ) and such centres also in the 11 districts.
India has so far reported three confirmed cases of the virus, all in Kerala.
One of the three medical students, who had tested positive for novel coronavirus infection and were treated at a hospital in Kerala, has been discharged after recovery, Union Health Minister Harsh Vardhan had said on Thursday.
About the other two, he said subsequent tests indicated significant reduction in “viral load”.

The health ministry has asked people to refrain from travelling to China in view of the coronavirus outbreak and said travellers on return could be quarantined"

I do think respecting user privacy is important and I do think licensing for shows/movies/etc. is bullshit in a lot of cases (which is why I'm on r/DataHoarder).

However, I also have seen the value in having companies be able to develop apps like Reddit's mobile app. I believe that it's completely acceptable to give your data to a company instead of your hard-earned cash, given they respect your privacy. 

Sure, Cambridge Analytica happened, but it's not 2005 anymore. We have better security and smarter users. 

For example, Private Internet Access recently went Open Source: https://www.privateinternetaccess.com/blog/2018/03/private-internet-access-goes-open-source/

Just like any other business, Private Internet Access is a business that needs to make money. However, they are making moves to right their wrongs and are tearing down their walls. 

The value here is that because they are a large company, they can provide the reliability and infrastructure for a good VPN that a completely open source solution simply wouldn't have.

Without profit, we wouldn't have businesses to give out money too, products to buy, or jobs at all. Of course there are always going to be C level execs and shareholders that want to increase their profit and money in their pocket, but not everyone is the devil.

Look at Bill Gates. That dude made a business and is living off of royalties/investments. Does that make him a bad guy? I mean, if you consider donating $100 million to studying coronavirus bad, then I guess, sure."

I provided an example of how Singapore is approaching things.

One of the most basic items that requires attention is to ensure that personal protective equipment (PPE) for frontline healthcare professionals is available in reasonable quantities.  As this article (from yesterday) notes, there are concerns at a hospital in Montreal and an indication from their provincial ministry that there is no timeline on resolving it:  [https://www.lapresse.ca/actualites/sante/202002/14/01-5261071-coronavirus-la-penurie-dequipement-de-protection-inquiete-au-quebec.php](https://www.lapresse.ca/actualites/sante/202002/14/01-5261071-coronavirus-la-penurie-dequipement-de-protection-inquiete-au-quebec.php) 

This may be an isolated situation or it may be a more widespread problem.  It is discomforting to know that senior doctors need to use the media in order to call attention to such a basic topic given the rising threat.

On your second point, I don't think anyone has suggested lab testing everyone ""who has a fever"", where did you get that idea?

Broadening screening to include cases of serious flu or pneumonia would likely be more appropriate and is along the lines of what the CDC have indicated they are in the process of doing in major US cities.

Finally, if we lack capacity now, when we have time to prepare, doing nothing isn't going to make it any easier to resolve that should the need arise.  Thus the reason leadership and action are encouraged now."

WHO placed it AFTER the 23rd and waited like a damn week to announce that it was a global health emergency and still didnt even issue a travel ban of China but focused more on fighting ""racism"" before they realized this shit was more serious 

The CCP said they had everything under control and it was safe, they lied. They allowed their citizens to continue on like nothing was happening and even had a giant ass festival in Wuhan where 40,000 familiar took part in before the quarantine.  

So again, common sense is making ""big statements?"" Little kids are still developing their lungs and those kids could have a higher chance to be seriously ill if they get a virus that is more deadly than your common flu, and possibly even die. This isn't a big statement. I dont need WHO tell me something that is common sense. Maybe you do because you are a lemming but I do not. 27 kids have died from the simple flu this flu season according to the CDC which is the highest since 2003. The typical flu has a death rate of what? 0.01%. And in 2017-2018 187 kids died. Now add a virus that has anywhere north of a 2% death rate and it's common sense that more kids would die.

2020-02-15,cycologist,medlabprofessionals,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/medlabprofessionals/comments/f4anqp/biotin_interference_pcr/fhpj4wg/,"Nope.  But say it's 1996, you're short on all this fancy fluorescence chemistry and PCR hardware, and you really want a good  (fast, cheap, sensitive enough, reasonable throughput) HIV PCR (i.e. Roche Amplicor, the TaqMan assay's predecessor).  Biotin is easy to work with, so you could biotinylate your PCR primers' tails, which means that every PCR-product DNA amplicon you generate by extending those primers has biotin on its tail too.

Now you can detect biotinylated PCR product like the final step of an ELISA-type assay.  Even in 1996 you definitely didn't want to run an agarose gel and look for amplicon with toxic ethidium bromide: ain't nobody got time for that.  Gels are non-quantitative and insensitive, too.  Amplicor limit of quantitation was 400, taqman HIV 1.0 was 40, taqman 2.0 is 20.  So, biotin chemistry is not bad even by modern molecular-lab standards: untreated, chronic-disease HIV viral load is a few hundred thousand and in 1996 if you had a viral load less than the LOD for Amplicor (50 or so) you were in good shape.

Used to be it was hard to work with DNA/RNA.  Right now, if you're faced with, say, a novel coronavirus, you have its genome sequence in a week, a bunch of fancy PCR primer synthetic chemistry that can be delivered overnight (and all sorts of plug and play PCR components, and the informatics capability to make the primers work in silico), and a PCR cycler with more brains than 1970s spacecraft just sitting around.  Don't need biotin, but it's still good enough in some applications."
2020-02-15,Ergospheroid,chess,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/chess/comments/f407o9/predictions_for_the_candidates/fhpjpsk/,"> Fabi’s rating was consistently well above Ding’s in part because ding gets a lot of draws vs lower rated players that Fabi generally converts.

They were actually only 1 point apart on the [September rating list](https://www.fide.com/news/65), but your general point is correct. However, a better way of putting it is that Caruana was primarily maintaining his high rating by winning points from weaker players, while not necessarily playing particularly well against the elite. (Indeed, if you consider only his games against players rated 2750+ during 2019, Caruana actually *lost* Elo points on average.) This is reflected in his lack of tournament victories throughout the year.

Ding, meanwhile, performed incredibly well against 2750+ opposition, achieving a ~2850 rating performance against opponents of that caliber. It's true that he had more draws against lower-rated opponents (particularly during the World Cup), but note that those draws came primarily from mixed-format events *like* the World Cup, where players are incentivized to draw in classical and win in rapid/blitz, where their edge is more pronounced. (And in fact we see this reflected in Ding's rapid/blitz ratings, which are significantly higher than Caruana's.)

In my view, it's really not possible to argue that Caruana's results during 2019 were even close to Ding's. His best result was shared first at the Grand Swiss (losing out on tiebreaks), which really doesn't compare to a Sinquefield Cup victory, a top-two finish at the World Cup, or a Grand Chess Tour finals victory, much less all three together.

I'm not saying Ding is favored over Caruana to win the Candidates, especially with the coronavirus issue, as well as Caruana's excellent performance at Wijk aan Zee. But regarding their 2019 performances, well--only one of them was even remotely competitive with Magnus for player of the year, and it wasn't Caruana."

Coronavirus likely now ‘gathering steam’

Leaky international cordon may mean equivalent of worst flu season in modern times

Alvin Powell
Harvard Staff Writer
February 11, 2020

The number of confirmed cases of the Wuhan coronavirus have continued to surge inside China, sickening tens of thousands, with a death toll of more than 1,000. But outside the Asian giant the numbers remain a fraction of that, a trend Harvard’s Marc Lipsitch views with suspicion. Lipsitch thinks it is just a matter of time before the virus spreads widely internationally, which means nations so far only lightly hit should prepare for its eventual arrival in force and what may seem like the worst flu season in modern times. Lipsitch, professor of epidemiology at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health and head of the School’s Center for Communicable Disease Dynamics, talked to the Gazette about recent developments in the outbreak and provided a look ahead.

Q&A
Marc Lipsitch
GAZETTE:  We spoke about the Wuhan coronavirus outbreak about a week and a half ago. What do we know now that we didn’t know then?

LIPSITCH:  We know that the spread is even greater than it was then. It was likely then that it would spread more widely, but there was still hope for containment. I think now that it’s in more countries — even Singapore, which is really good at tracing cases, has found some cases that aren’t linked to previous known cases — it’s clear that there are probably many cases in countries where we haven’t yet found them. This is really a global problem that’s not going to go away in a week or two.

GAZETTE:  You indicated that the rapid increase in cases was largely due to existing cases that hadn’t been diagnosed rather than new infections. Is that still your sense, or is some of the daily increase in cases due to new transmission?

LIPSITCH:  It’s clearly partly due to new transmission — and it was partly due to new transmission then. Separating out reporting delays from new transmission is hard, but over the last few days, it appears that the rate of increase in new cases in China has slowed relative to the exponential growth we saw before. Some people are cautiously hopeful that that’s due to the success of control measures rather than the inability to count many cases. I think that’s possible, since the control measures have been rather extreme in some places. So, now the question is whether these control measures are working or whether we’re mostly seeing a saturation in their ability to test thousands of cases.

GAZETTE:  When we talk about control measures, I think the one that’s most obvious to people who are following this are the quarantines. Are there other things going on that are also important?

LIPSITCH:  For the cutting off of Wuhan, cordon sanitaire is probably a better word for it because the movement restrictions apply to everybody, not just the exposed people. They’re not exactly quarantined. Then there’s the quarantine of people who are sick and may or may not have the coronavirus, along with the isolation of people who have the coronavirus. All of that may be helping. We’ve had some concerns based on news reports that the way they’re doing the bulk quarantine and isolation of cases could be harmful in China, but it’s very hard to get a clear answer on what exactly is being done. The early reports said that they were taking people who were confirmed corona cases and putting them together in mass quarters with people who were not confirmed as corona but might have a fever or respiratory symptoms. If that was true, that could spread the virus further. Since then, I’ve heard a number of times that that’s not actually true. So I don’t know what to think of that. It doesn’t seem like the sort of thing a responsible public health agency would do.

GAZETTE:  Has it become apparent that the virus is either easier to transmit or more deadly than previously thought? Or are these increasing case and fatality numbers in line with what our thinking was a week ago?

LIPSITCH:  The ease of transmission is still being confirmed. In terms of the so-called “R-nought,” or how many secondary cases a single case infects, experts’ assessment is getting tighter around a level of transmissibility that’s perhaps lower than SARS, which was about 3 and higher than pandemic flu, which can be up to about 2. But what makes this one perhaps harder to control than SARS is that it may be possible to transmit before you are sick, or before you are very sick — so it’s hard to block transmission by just isolating confirmed cases.

GAZETTE:  Is that the most concerning new information, that it might be transmissible before symptoms are apparent? That would seem to make this a lot trickier.

LIPSITCH:  Yes. I think that’s the most concerning piece, but the evidence for that so far in the public domain is pretty limited. I’ve seen hints that aren’t published yet, but the evidence for that that’s been peer reviewed is quite limited. On severity, estimates are that it’s worse than seasonal flu, where about one in 1,000 infected cases die, and it’s not as bad as SARS, where 8 or 9 percent of infected cases died. I’ve been working with some colleagues on estimates. They’re preliminary still but bounded by those two. That’s a large range, however, so the important question is where the final figure ends up, because 3 or 4 percent of cases dying would be much more worrisome than 0.4 percent.

“There’s likely to be a period of widespread transmission in the U.S., and I hope we will avert the kind of chaos that some other places are seeing.”

GAZETTE:  Is it significant that there are so few cases internationally compared with the number in China? Is that an indication that control measures are working or is it just gathering steam internationally?

LIPSITCH:  Unfortunately, I think it’s more likely to be that it’s gathering steam. We’ve released a preprint that we’ve been discussing publicly — and trying to get peer reviewed in the meantime — that looks at the numbers internationally, based on how many cases you would expect from normal travel volumes. And a couple of things are striking. One is that there are countries that really should be finding cases and haven’t yet, like Indonesia and maybe Cambodia. They are outside the range of uncertainty you would expect even given variability between countries. So our best guess is that there are undetected cases in those countries. Indonesia said a couple of days ago that it had done 50 tests, but it has a lot of air travel with Wuhan, let alone the rest of China. So 50 tests is not enough to be confident you’re catching all the cases. That’s one bit of evidence that to me was really striking. Second, I was reading The Wall Street Journal that Singapore had three cases so far that were not traced to any other case. Singapore is the opposite of Indonesia, in that they have more cases than you would expect based on their travel volume, probably because they’re better at detection. And even they are finding cases that they don’t have a source for. That makes me think that many other places do as well. Of course, we’re making guesses from limited information, but I think they’re pretty likely to be correct guesses, given the totality of information."

This is a rapidly evolving epidemic and the passengers on the Diamond Princess are no worse off than those locked down in quarantine in other countries. You really think even the United States is letting its returnees just roam freely? Not a chance, that's why they are all locked down on military bases and guarded by people who know how to follow orders to the letter if the situation warrants. It is the first time since 1918 the U.S. has had a full blown quarantine, but I think armed soldiers still have their orders to use lethal force if necessary. 
The Diamond Princess should have been fumigated and its ventilation system cleaned and devices placed in the intakes to prevent the virus from spreading. But these measures probably were not warranted in our early attempts to understand the coronavirus. When we are still trying, almost two months into the epidemic, to establish methods of transmission, life expectancy of the virus on objects, accurate tests for infection, an immunization, which is projected 18 months away, medical care for the infected, quarantine protocol-self quarantine? And a plethora of other things we have yet to realize as this epidemic spreads. Globally, we cannot even supply people with cheap cotton masks.

There were no test kits/methods at the beginning of the Diamond Princess quarantine or at least very limited. Even the U.S. has had faulty test kits. So I imagine this is why Japan did not initially test all the passengers and the standard worldwide is to test after the exhibition of symptoms by a person, NOT to indiscriminately test the whole population. There have been negative test results from patients who later tested positive. So testing is not foolproof. I admitted myself into the VA hospital in Tampa, Florida three years ago because I had a rapid onset of fever, 104°, less than 12 hours, with a headache that felt like my head was exploding. Two nasal swabs came back negative for influenza. After I insisted that something was wrong, because this was the fastest and worst illness I had ever had in 50 years, the doctor ran a swab up my nose on both sides into what felt like my brain. I eventually convinced them that I had something bad, so they admitted me into a general ward with at least eight other patients. The next day, 24 hours later, the test came back positive for influenza A. Needless to say my roommates weren't too happy and I got put in my own private room, where everyone came in wearing suits, gloves, eye shields and masks.

When one of my shipmates came down with the chicken pox while on patrol in the Gulf of Gunave, near Cuba, he was removed from the ship and isolated at Guantanamo Naval Hospital. So removing the infected from the Diamond Princess seems to be the standard procedure. But with the lack of a definite virus contraction to symptom exhibition or even positive test timeline it makes sense to leave the rest of the passengers where they are and not move them and all their belongings to another quarantine facility for 14 plus days. Japan is not the only country preventing passengers exposed to this virus from disembarking and it probably will be the last. Why did not the Diamond Princess leave Japan for other ports that may have been more receptive to the virus epidemic onboard?

As the virus epidemic has unfolded, the timeline from contraction to symptom exhibition has not been standardized, 14 days seems to be more of an estimated window with the U.S. clearing some evacuees after 12.5 days and North Korea mandating a 30 day quarantine period.

It is easy to look at a situation after the fact and armchair quarterback it, but when you are on the frontlines, catching flack from all sides, you do your best with the knowledge and tools at hand. I think Japan, being the first to encounter this situation, has done what is necessary due to the rapidly evolving coronavirus, COVID-19!"

This was a thing for Nazi Germany, but is STILL a thing for Communism, because while people don't want to be the bearer of any bad news critical to the status quo they have adopted, they DO want to show their use to the Cause. Take the 1st Doctor in China who blew the whistle and tried to draw attention to the Coronavirus, or the MMA fighter who called traditional Chinese Martial Arts inferior to the more modernised system. What's the reaction from the mass-converted or the bootlickers, to the individuals who can think for themselves? ""Ban this person. Shut them up. Act like they don't exist or are a conspiracy theorist."" And when none of that works, even if they destroy these people's livelihoods but they refuse to stop, they then move on to trying to kill these people instead.

Its also real for the corporate world, because that was the treatment that was given to James Damore by Google. Its real for the political lolitical world, because that's what the male feminist Justin Trudeau tried to do with a State Prosecutor - who was a woman - when she was trying to investigate the corruption going on in Canada with this company SNC Lavalin.

And its a mindset that's true for social life as well. I had a friend who over the past few years, displayed this narrow-minded zealousness against certain groups, or the manifestation of certain outcomes. When the narrative that all Incels of the world are just latent criminals set to eventually go mad and kill everyone around them, I who am familiar with a lot of the going ons for men's issues and rights discussions, understood that those people who have gone mad, are not reflective of the majority. He vehemently did not agree, however, and spat on the idea of having any sympathy for these people, who were being scapegoated by essentially every other low-effort opinionator who all failed to have the basic human decency, to have consideration for the notion that a lot of these people were going through depression, had been the victims of abuse themselves, and were basically vilified just for being alive and not being valuable enough to be of service to some corporate outlet in the form of labour, or women. He could not see, refused to see, the fellow humanity of these people. But he didn't even realise that he was the flipside to whatever hatred some of them may have expressed in their tiny circles of blogs or subreddits.

I put this down to his orientation of being Centre Left, as I am Centre Right, and we moved on. But it happened again. This time when the ThotAudit happened. And myself, who has never availed of any sex services and found lewd livestream and dating outlets like Chaturbate or Tinder or Twitch, to be kind of useless in the everyday access to porn, thought little of it. So when the situation happened last year, and all of these camgirls were getting put up for calls from the IRS and other Taxmen, I thought it was hilarious, as did I find the totally justified, moral fury of those who reported them for it. This was a holy war in a teacup, with washed up and low-effort camgirls - who were all suddenly sex workers who worked as hard as Stoya, now - and their defenders/white knights, versus those who were sick of their platforms getting seedy, their own friends and wallets getting fleeced, and the morally lionised who wanted to put an end to the sex work industry and all the exploitation that surrounds it. Hoes were mad, consumers were mad, but nobody else had to be as I saw it. Cue my former friend, who actually went and said in response to this situation, parroting some other stripper or camgirl whose tweets he was following ""Snitches get Stitches."" He was blind to reason, again, and myself and our friend who was a girl, were just ignored by him, nothing that we were trying to get through to him ever landed.

The third time he did it was last month, to me, just as Ireland was having an election. He lost his shit with me and called me a Fascist, and then threatened me with violence if I was to go with my voting choice. When I pointed out to him that that in itself is a tendency for Fascists, he hung up the phone and hasn't contacted me since. 

Now, because I'm not a fucking pleb, I know a good chunk of the nature of what's going on in my country, and right now it's not looking good, the election is over. Despite this, the two political parties of people who everyone wanted out still hold between them nearly 40-something seats, and the political group who everyone settled on, but are still just the third head of this Hydra still hungry to snack on the taxpayers, are arguing their right to be in charge via the popular vote.

Mind you, I'm Nationalistic, and for very valid reasons. Our native population is suffering from homelessness and being threatened to be turfed out of their homes by bankers and vulture fund internationalists. Our borders are more open than a prostitute's legs after a train was run on her, and not only has crime increased exponentially in a lot of places - and even in the worst ways, we just got word of a grooming gang getting put through court recently who affected 220 kids but needed a fucking translator in court - but healthcare and housing and the costs of living are artificially raised, the more people we let in. Seeing as none of those big three I mentioned are willing to set a standard and help their own people out as a whole, but are willing to go and make all sorts of virtue signals for the LGBT crowd in order to distract everyone from all the rest of the shit they're allowing to happen, and have even started to fuck over our farmers and fuck over one of our biggest exports in the form of beef and dairy by outsourcing to Brazil and industrialising that whole economic cornerstone of my country... I had a choice. I voted for a Nationalist candidate, whose party was wrongfully being vilified as the Irish Fascists - can you believe such a fucking idea? - by the media and were never getting a fair platform, and whose canvas posters even during the election over these past few short weeks were being pulled down. I don't agree with everything they believe in forwarding, I'm pro-choice because I recognise that we're now in a low-trust society by going along with all this, and Leftists going too far left in their decisionmaking have now made everyone more unsafe. But I want to see my country get better, and my people snap out of the fucking mental illness that they're courting in just going along. 

I'm seeing this same ""Snitches get Stitches"" mindset that has completely and utterly fucked over the nation of China and its people, wrecking my country now. Because people are so trauma-bonded to the status quo of things being as they are, that they are afraid for anything else to come along and even try to have honest discourse, and an honest effort to tackle the problems and issues of my culture that's being caused by this collectivism. They have had their faith in mankind itself eroded by all of these bastards and the endless deluge of depressing information which conveys that nothing ever changes, human misery is a constant, and everyone is as bad as each other, culpable to becoming the worst of humanity, all of the time. 

So it's not a matter of me checking out of society, or completely losing faith in people, and me being eager to adopt this mindset in my own right as representing the 'other group' I will be more inclined to agree with. I bring all this up, because I will choose to believe in Life, and goodness, and fighting for that in its honest manifestation, instead of sneakily putting on the airs of what is socially fashionable and preaching love, while hating everyone else all the while at heart out of insecurity."

Speech at the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the People's Republic of China during work on the response to the new coronavirus pneumonia epidemic

Study responses at the Standing Committee of the Politburo

Speech at work on new coronavirus pneumonia

(February 3, 2020)

Xi Jinping

After the outbreak of the new coronavirus pneumonia in Wuhan, on January 7, when I presided over a meeting of the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee, I made a request for the prevention and control of the new coronavirus pneumonia. On January 20, I specifically issued an instruction on the prevention and control of the epidemic, stating that we must attach great importance to the epidemic, do our best to prevent and control it, and require party committees, governments and relevant departments at all levels to put the safety and health of the people first Take effective measures to resolutely curb the spread of the epidemic. On January 22, in view of the rapid spread of the epidemic and the severe challenges of prevention and control, I explicitly requested Hubei Province to implement comprehensive and strict control over the outflow of personnel. On the first day of the first month, I once again presided over a meeting of the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee to re-examine, re-deploy, and mobilize the epidemic prevention and control, especially patient treatment, and decided to set up a central leadership team for epidemic response.

From the first day of the year to the present, prevention and control of the epidemic situation is my most concerned issue. I keep track of the spread of the epidemic situation and the progress of the prevention and control work, and continue to give oral instructions and instructions. The Party Central Committee issued the ""Notice on Strengthening the Party's Leadership and Providing Strong Political Guarantee for Winning the Fight Against Epidemic Prevention and Control"". The Central Leadership Group for Epidemic Response has met several times to study and deploy epidemic prevention and control work, and the front steering group has also actively carried out its work. The State Council ’s joint prevention and control mechanism has strengthened coordination and scheduling to coordinate and resolve urgent issues encountered in prevention and control work in a timely manner. Relevant departments perform their duties, and the military actively supports local epidemic prevention and control. Leading groups in charge of comrades in charge of the party and government have been established in various regions, and Level I responses to major public health emergencies have been initiated. The various government, military, and army organs and enterprises and institutions took urgent action and fought hard. The selfless dedication and bravery of the medical staff, the broad masses of the people and the city united and fought together. The situation of comprehensive mobilization, comprehensive deployment and comprehensive strengthening of epidemic prevention and control has taken shape across the country. Under the centralized and unified leadership of the Party Central Committee and the joint efforts of all parties, the prevention and control work is being vigorously carried out, and all sectors of society and international public opinion are generally good. When I met with the Director-General of the World Health Organization, Tan Desai, Tan Desai said that the speed and scale of China's action are rare and the world is rare. This is China's institutional advantage. The relevant experience is worth learning from other countries. Measures will effectively control and eventually overcome the epidemic.

On February 10, 2020, Xi Jinping, General Secretary of the CPC Central Committee, State President, and Chairman of the Central Military Commission, investigated and guided the prevention and control of the new crown pneumonia epidemic in Beijing. This is Xi Jinping's investigation at the Center for Disease Control and Prevention of Chaoyang District. Xinhua News Agency reporter Liu Bin / photo

In general, the Central Committee's judgment on the epidemic situation is accurate, all work arrangements are timely, and the measures adopted are also effective. Now, the most critical issue is to work hard, carefully, and to the ground. Let me highlight a few points.

I. On the situation of epidemic prevention and control and key tasks of epidemic prevention and control

Doing a good job in epidemic prevention and control directly affects the safety of people's lives and physical health, and directly affects the stability of the overall economic and social situation. It also has a bearing on China's opening up. We must do a good job in accordance with the requirements of firm confidence, mutual help, scientific control, and precise policy, race at the same time, and fight against the disease, resolutely curb the spread of the epidemic, and resolutely win the battle against epidemic prevention and control. At present, we must focus on the following tasks in epidemic prevention and control.

On February 10, 2020, Xi Jinping, General Secretary of the CPC Central Committee, State President, and Chairman of the Central Military Commission, investigated and guided the prevention and control of the new crown pneumonia epidemic in Beijing. This is Xi Jinping's remote diagnosis and treatment center at Beijing Ditan Hospital, Capital Medical University. He used video to connect to Jinyintan Hospital, Xiehe Hospital, and Vulcan Mountain Hospital in Wuhan to treat patients with new coronary pneumonia, to understand the situation, listen to opinions and suggestions, and console first-line medical workers. Xinhua News Agency reporter Xie Huanchi / photo

First, strengthen unified leadership of epidemic prevention and control. To prevent and control the epidemic, we must adhere to a national chess game. Party committees and governments at all levels must resolutely obey the unified command, coordination, and dispatch of the party's central committee to ensure that orders are prohibited. At present, the implementation of the Party Central Committee's decision-making and deployment in all regions and departments is generally good, but there are also some weak links and issues worth noting. We must make up for shortcomings and plug loopholes. Epidemic prevention and control is not only a medical and health issue, but a comprehensive work, is a general battle, and all work must provide support to win the battle against epidemic prevention and control. The situation of epidemic prevention and control is constantly changing, and various tasks are constantly faced with new situations and new problems. We must follow closely, analyze in a timely manner, act quickly, and do our work firmly and unswervingly.

When adopting prevention and control measures in various regions and departments, it is necessary to consider both the prevention and control needs of the region and its area, as well as the impact on key areas and national prevention and control. Those who fail to implement the decision-making arrangements of the Party Central Committee must dare to criticize and order them to rectify immediately. For those who do not obey unified command and dispatch, serious standardism, and those who dare not to assume responsibility, drift in style, and ridicule others, in addition to investigating the responsibilities of those directly responsible, they must also hold the party and government leaders accountable for serious circumstances. Those who fail to perform their duties shall be punished according to discipline and law.

Second, strengthen epidemic prevention and control in key areas. Only by focusing on controlling the epidemic situation in key areas can we fundamentally reverse the spread of the epidemic nationwide as soon as possible. It is necessary to focus on regional coordination of prevention and control forces, resolutely focus rescue and protection resources on the front line of fighting the epidemic, and give priority to meeting the needs of frontline medical staff and treating patients. Hubei Province, especially Wuhan City, is still the top priority of national epidemic prevention and control, and most patients in other places also have contact history in Hubei. Having stabilized the epidemic in Hubei, the overall situation of the country was stabilized. On the one hand, we must continue to comprehensively strengthen prevention and control, strictly implement early detection, early reporting, early quarantine, and early treatment measures across the province, strengthen epidemic surveillance, focus on treating patients, and take home medical observations of all close contacts. On the other hand, we must continue to strengthen measures to prevent the spread of the epidemic. Civil aviation, railways, highways, and water passenger transportation in Hubei have been closed. This has played an important role in controlling the epidemic throughout the country, but the risks caused by the outflow of some personnel cannot be ignored."

I doubt anyone knowledgeable about China thinks they are not lying to their own people.

However chasing down a theory hole about government labs and such is essentially pointless because China is a big black box. Nobody actually knows what’s going on inside the box, not even the people who live there. Probably the people who run things do not have perfect information. It’s very easy to just take a few points and spin it in a clever way that runs entirely along the lines of your preexisting political framework, but it’s likely incompetence is the cause and continuing exacerbating factor in this serious health crisis, which will impact everyone on earth in some way shape or form.

If you look at my post history you will see I came here after the Night In The Woods guy killed himself because I left somewhere else, and I mostly posted about Kingdom Hearts until the coronavirus outbreak, because I lived in China for a long time but stopped following their news out of sadness and resignation over the Hong Kong protests."

The Hong Kong movement started due to a new law the CCP had funded that didnt just allow but required extradition of anyone the CCP applied to arrest regardless of the legal basis of the criminal accusation in Hong Kong's law; in China there is no freedom of speech and its an arrestable offense to go against the government in any way (for example read up about Li Wenliang, the whistleblower for coronavirus) which would mean that the population of a foreign country (hong kong) would be subject to the laws of china. That is internationally recognised legal grounds that the UK government had to cave in to during the troubles in Ireland. Furthermore the UK and China agreed in the 90s that Hong Kong would remain independant for a scheduled time and the laws being backed by the CCP in Hong Kong would have illegally subverted this international agreement. 

I would appreciate more information on Uighur history in China but my reason for believing the story in the first place was that China dont provide any details on the terror attacks, and even then you are arguing that a whole people should be locked up in concentration camps because a small minority are extremists; should the UK have arrested everyone in ireland during the troubles? there was a much higher population of extremists in Ireland after Bloody Sunday than any muslim population ive heard of. Is the UK government in the right for their actions during Bloody Sunday just because you believe being outnumbered by a peaceful protest is reason enough to use live weapons and that 'everyone does it so why should we argue against it'?

In hong kong they brought in military-grade APCs and used live weapons not just rubber bullets and tear gas. The problem with China (as opposed to Russia and USA) is theyre at an orwellian level of control with a government policy only comparable to either Stalin or Hitler. The USA is heading towards Mussolini level of facism and Russia is an olligarchy created from the various city mafias that sprung up after the soviet union. 

To the media point, id disagree mainly on our opinion of what the demand is; people want to see action and its only since dickheads like mcconnell came into power that the belief all media (rather than just some media) is propaganda as it plays into the hands of politicians: instead of action and accountability of old media, digital media has allowed them to spin things before anyone can be made accountable for their actions. Dismissing something as fake without providing any evidence wasnt a thing before a con man swayed the closed minded into letting him steal the presidency, as such i believe using 'fake news' turns your own bias into propaganda by closing your own mind to new information.

(after your edit) this is where my misinterpretation happened; i couldnt figure out if you were arguing that this mindset is justified or that the chinese people agree with the government. On a governmental level you are 100% correct as they are no different to other politicians but rememeber the people have no ability to fight back (see: your argument about the uighurs and justification surrounding the hong kong situation) which imo negates your plato argument as he was never saying 'our government should have a right to ignore the will of the people' but rather that it was an issue that we dont have the ability to control as power will always attract corrupt people. The difference is now we can control it better; the orwellian nature of the CCP shows that everyone can be controlled and the only reason its not been used on the corrupt is theyre still in power. Brexit was suggested due to corruption in taxes leading to a level of transparency the powerful dont want, the misinformation throughout the brexit process shows that the 'fake news' mentality is corruptive in and of itself and the results of brexit (both the votes and the deals) is evidence to your point but your argument seems to be that we should give up and let ourselves be tricked as thats how its always happened instead of grouping together and demanding better. The 5 points of Hong Kong's protesters were reasonable and simply demanded for their basic rights (already guaranteed in the China-UK agreement) be respected, but youre arguing that the protesters were the ones in the wrong even though the CCP only listened when countries started threatening sanctions.

TLDR; both sides push propaganda, but it is far from equal in its extremes"

> His passionate attack on the government&#039;s system of controls and censorship, Viral Alarm: When Fury Overcomes Fear, was published last week as a powerful debate on freedom of speech convulsed the country.

> Since he took power in late 2012, Xi has tightened ideological control and suppressed civil freedoms across the nation, reversing a trend under his predecessor to give Chinese media some limited scope to expose and report regional corruption and lower-level officials&#039; misdeeds.

2020-02-15,InstgramEgg,econmonitor,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/econmonitor/comments/f4cuaa/consumer_remains_in_good_shape_ongoing_struggles/fhpgeip/,"> So what does this all mean for the U.S. outlook? On balance, the
U.S. economic data have broadly shown a more positive trend over
the past few months, and this week’s indicator performance
supports that trend. That said, GDP growth in Q1 is nonetheless set
for a slowdown, to a 1.5% annualized pace, as another sizeable drag
from inventories alongside a modest drag from trade are poised to
weigh on the pace of overall growth. 

\

> Until there is a greater
understanding of the magnitude of the economic impact, the
coronavirus poses downside risk to the outlook. However, our base
case is that the virus does not become a full-blown pandemic, and
that the short-term U.S. economic impact is noticeable, yet
manageable. As such, we look for the U.S. economy to remain in
expansion, with real GDP increasing at a 2.0% pace this year."

I think at least at work people aren't as ignorant to think that since I'm Chinese (who hasn't even been back to China since many years ago) I might get the coronavirus. That being said I do find myself trying much harder to not cough or anything while I'm in public. I had to sneeze once I was on a bus and turned away and covered my mouth but the person next to me got up and left their seat immediately. Felt kind of sad but I could understand their thoughts. Better safe than sorry.

Chinese President Xi Jinping has called for tightened control over online discussion and increased policing to ensure ""positive energy"" and social stability, state media said Saturday, as the country struggles to contain the deadly new coronavirus.

Xi's remarks were made public as the authorities have faced rare bouts of public anger over the handling of an epidemic that has killed more than 1,500 people and infected some 66,000 across the country.

Censors had allowed some online criticism of local officials in central Hubei -- the epicentre and origin of the crisis -- but calls for freedom of speech and political reform were scrubbed after the death of a whistleblowing doctor from the virus.

The government must ""strengthen the management and control of online media,"" and ""crack down on those who seize the opportunity to create rumours"" on the internet, Xi said in the February 3 speech published by state media.

Simultaneously, ""it is necessary to increase use of police force and strengthen the visible use of police,"" Xi said, calling for a crackdown on behaviour that ""disrupts social order"" including hoarding medical supplies.

Xi urged party members to ""dare to criticise"" those who had failed to carry out the Communist Party central committee's instructions, and warned ""those who fail to perform their duties shall be punished according to discipline and law.""
Local officials in Hubei have already begun to feel the force of Xi's orders.

On Thursday, the political chiefs of Hubei and its capital, Wuhan, were sacked and replaced by Xi loyalists with security backgrounds.
The province's top two health officials have also been fired.
Xi also called for the government to emphasize effective actions it has taken and ""vividly describe touching deeds"" from the frontlines of the fight against the virus.

""Let positive energy fill the cyberspace from start to end,"" Xi said in the speech, given earlier this month at a meeting of the Politburo Standing Committee, China's ruling council.

Xi initially kept a low profile in the early weeks of the crisis but has stepped up his public rhetoric in recent days on what he has called a ""people's war"" against the virus."

I work in IT doing development/Sys Admin for a small retail company.  Typically I'm just responsible for modifications, interfacing new systems and keeping things running.

This past week though, I had to help the logistics department get this old (2006ish) Zebra brand label printer going to print about 12,000 labels to mail to our factory in China because the company that normally does that for us in China is closed due to the Coronavirus.  I don't even know why we still have the thing, it's been in storage for over a decade at this point.

Getting their windows 10 machines to even talk to this printer was impossible.  I finally got it going by giving them spare laptop with Debian on it and using a generic CUPS driver.  Except it would randomly stop every 12-15 labels.  So someone had to stay there and manually restart the queue (which worked fine) every 30 seconds or so.

Screw printing lol.

YESTERDAY, SECRETARY AZAR MENTIONED THAT THE CDC HAS BEGUN WORKING WITH FIVE PUBLIC HEALTH LABS TO CONDUCT COMMUNITY BASED INFLUENZA BASED SURVEILLANCE SO WE CAN TEST THOSE WITH FLU LIKE SYMPTOMS FOR NOVEL CORONAVIRUS.  THOSE PUBLIC HEALTH LABS ARE IN LOS ANGELES, SAN FRANCISCO, SEATTLE, CHICAGO AND NEW YORK CITY AND I WANT TO THANK THEM FOR THEIR PARTICIPATION, COLLABORATION AND SUPPORT.  THIS IS JUST THE STARTING POINT AND WE PLAN TO EXPAND TO MORE SITES IN THE COMING WEEKS UNTIL WE HAVE NATIONAL SURVEILLANCE. 

THIS IS LEVERAGING OUR EXISTING INFLUENZA AND VIRAL RESPIRATORY SURVEILLANCE SYSTEMS.  THIS IS AN EXTRA LAYER OF OUR RESPONSE THAT WILL HELP US DETECT IF AND WHEN THIS VIRUS IS SPREADING IN THE COMMUNITY.  ALL OF OUR EFFORTS NOW ARE TO PREVENT THE SUSTAINED SPREAD OF THE VIRUS IS IN OUR COMMUNITY BUT WE NEED TO BE PREPARED FOR THE POSSIBILITY THAT IT WILL SPREAD.  RESULTS FROM THIS SURVEILLANCE WOULD BE AN EARLY WARNING SIGNAL TO TRIGGER A CHANGE IN OUR RESPONSE STRATEGY.

TL;DR: China, the US, and the rest of the world are all still trying to deploy reliable fast test kits due to nuances (ie.14 day incubation period) with the virus and the speed of development. Many different players producing Test Kits with varying timelines for clinical testing & test results. The distribution of test kits appears to have fallen behind the global demand. The need for specialized labs to test slows and limits the testing. A false-negative result is most likely to occur if inadequate numbers of organisms are present in the specimen due to early/improper collection, transport or handling."
