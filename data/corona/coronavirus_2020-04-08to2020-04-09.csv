Been monitoring these [pre-publications](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.30.015347v1) for a couple weeks now. 

This isn't much of a surprise, since cats (and ferrets) are especially susceptible to their own coronavirus (enteric coronavirus and FIP); however, all of the reports I've read only detail cats being susceptible to COVID-19 but unable to transmit it. These cases are likely a 'reverse zoonosis' where humans are transmitting COVID-19 to cats, but they are unable to transmit it back to us - so far. One study used a small group of cats and inoculated them with a heavy load of viral particles, and found that naive cats exhibited respiratory signs. The big cats at the Bronx zoo were super interesting, and I'm waiting for more of that story to come out. Who was in contact with those cats?!

There are a few groups out there utilizing [ferrets](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=covid+ferret) as an animal model to recapitulate human disease. Looking forward to see where that goes.

Coronaviruses infect many species of mammals, Maybe even all of them, from mice to whales. However, each coronavirus will have a specific range of mammals that I can infect. This particular coronavirus seems to be really bad at infecting dogs, even though dogs have their own coronaviruses that do infect them.

The original SARS coronavirus originated in a bat and is thought to have been passed through a civet, which is a feloid related to felids (cats).  So it isn’t terribly surprising that this closely related coronavirus could also infect feloids, which include cats great and small.

So there is some relevance here. First of all, it means that we probably need to start looking at cats as a reservoir for this virus.  Having an animal reservoir makes it more difficult to get rid of a virus. Imagine if this would get into the feral cat population, a population that does have a fair amount of contact with humans.

It also means that if cat lovers are in high-risk occupations or or high-risk patients themselves, they may need to quarantine themselves from their feline friends."

So you want reasons to vote?
 
* [Sanders literally said to vote for the nominee.](https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/433364-sanders-pledges-to-support-democratic-nominee-in-2020)
 
> If we do not win, I will strongly support the Democratic nominee…and hope and believe that others feel exactly the same way. Donald Trump must be defeated,
 
This should be highlighted by the fact that he's an independent running as a Dem, he understands splitting the vote is disastrous.  For example blaming Nader for putting Bush in office.  We could have had Gore, a guy obsessed with climate change... instead we got Bush and he fucked the middle east for a generation yet again.
 
* Trump winning means a 7-2 supreme court.
 
The rest of your life every interpretation of the supreme court would be decided by a super-majority of hyper conservatives.  This is an unbelievable boon for anyone trying to regress our nation.
 
Row v Wade will fall.  Many states already are pushing through laws intentionally violating it to go to the supreme court.  That will be decided during the next 4 years.  This election decides how that likely ends.
 
Imagine the joy on McConnell's face as he signs in RBG's replacement.  Imagine the bullshit impotent reddit outrage where we call for signatures about it.  That's the future where Trump wins.  Think about this.
 
* Trump's crimes will remain protected behind the office of the presidency. 
 
Currently many groups want to rip Trump to shreds for lawbreaking.  The state of New York for example.  He is currently protected by his office however, and they cannot touch him. 
 
Stripping away that office means that rotten bastard spends the rest of his life in court, watching everything he's built be torn down around him.
 
Leaving him in office means he'll go most of the rest of his life protected.  And with his position set, his predecessor will simply cover for him.
 
As someone who wants this fuck brought to justice, this matters to me.
 
* Trump being re-elected validates his appointments and actions.
 
We have [a literal fucking white nationalist in the white house](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Miller_\(political_advisor\)), he had advisers who [harrassed shooting victims](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alex_Jones), and gave a [racist drug addict](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rush_Limbaugh) the fucking medal of freedom.
 
This is what you're signing off on helping him get elected.  And again, one of the two will win, not helping one is helping the other.  That's math, like it or not.
 
* He's currently fucking everything about the pandemic up.
 
With that heading do you think I mean [him downplaying the pandemic causing his supporters to refuse to take it seriously](https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/17/politics/fact-check-trump-always-knew-pandemic-coronavirus/index.html), [the theft of medical supplies from hospitals](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/06/us/politics/coronavirus-fema-medical-supplies.html), or  [stealing from our international allies](https://www.vox.com/2020/4/4/21208250/coronavirus-trump-canada-germany-spain-brazil), or did you think I meant [him removing all oversight from the bailout funds so he can do with them what he wants?](https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/trump-removes-inspector-general-who-was-to-oversee-2-trillion-stimulus-spending/2020/04/07/2f0c6cb8-78ea-11ea-9bee-c5bf9d2e3288_story.html)
 
The fact that during a *fucking pandemic* we can't guess which scandal is under this heading should itself be a bit of a warning, no?
 
* The GOP (and foreign groups who support trump) want to drive down turn out. 
 
Seriously, the GOP's whole strategy is getting you not to vote.  They fight against registration, they fight against more voting centers.  Their whole battle is to keep you from voting.
 
Why in the *fuck* would the right choice be to help them?
 
[They know a low turn out is the only way to win.](https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2020/04/republicans-now-just-admitting-they-want-fewer-americans-to-vote)  Conservatives are a minority of the population, but they vote consistently.  So getting you to stay home is how they win.
 
If your analysis of a situation ends with you doing exactly what the people trying to oppose your ideals wants you to do.... [including foreign groups](https://www.vpr.org/post/how-russian-social-media-effort-boosted-bernie#stream/0)... that's something you need to think about.  They're not on your side, why obey them?
 
* Him winning validates it all.
 
It tells our international allies that Trump wasn't a mistake, he *is* America now.  America is now a nation not to be trusted, not looked to.  It is closer to Russia than Germany internationally.
 
It shows that all of us on the internet are just noise.  Our petitions?  Our marches?  Irrelevant fucking hippies, just a noisy fringe.  Not actual Americans.  Real Americans are like those folks on T_D calling low-t soyboys like you cucks. 
 
That's what you're showing the world.

 
* Biden isn't as bad as the internet has convinced you he is.
 
He's not my first... or second or third... choice.  [However there is a lot on his platform I don't hate.](https://www.politico.com/2020-election/candidates-views-on-the-issues/joe-biden/)  $15 minimum wage?  Getting rid of death penalty?  Eliminate private prisons?  Some government funded college?  
 
Again, certainly isn't my favored candidate.  My personal political position is left to the point that I feel most businesses considered ""essential"" right now should very likely be nationalized because clearly it's essential for the security of the nation.  Healthcare, internet, power, water, etc. 
 
So he's sure as shit not perfect.  But he *is better*.
 
...
 
And once more, because any response is going to inevitably avoid this simple reality:  Either Biden or Trump ***WILL*** be president.  Two possible futures, no more or less.  No debate on that fact.  
 
If you're discouraging people from voting for Biden, you are campaigning for Trump.  They're the same thing.
 
If you want to talk about the morality of it, you should think about the people your inaction hurts.  Because that is still a choice you've made to help keep Trump in office.  Exactly like the GOP wants you to."

The evolving treatments highlight the fact that doctors are still learning the best way to manage a virus that emerged only months ago. They are relying on anecdotal, real-time data amid a crush of patients and shortages of basic supplies.

Mechanical ventilators push oxygen into patients whose lungs are failing. Using the machines involves sedating a patient and sticking a tube into the throat. Deaths in such sick patients are common, no matter the reason they need the breathing help.

Generally speaking, 40% to 50% of patients with severe respiratory distress die while on ventilators, experts say. But 80% or more of coronavirus patients placed on the machines in New York City have died, state and city officials say.”"

April 8, 2020 at 5:11 p.m. CDT

Every day, he goes online and checks his messages again and again, and every day is the same: no response. George Weinhouse, a 67-year-old retired anesthesiologist, answered the call weeks ago for volunteers with medical experience to help New York weather the worst pandemic since 1918.

Weinhouse stepped out of his comfortable post-career life, submitted his registration and credentials, and waited. Even as the coronavirus crisis approaches its peak in New York, straining the medical system like no other previous disaster, he’s still waiting.

As of Tuesday afternoon, Weinhouse was among 89,456 medical volunteers ready to relieve exhausted front line health providers. But just 7,000 have been assigned to a job, leaving about 92 percent yet to be deployed.

Inside a Brooklyn ICU

“I don’t know what’s going on here. I don’t understand this,” Weinhouse said this week, in the most recent of several telephone interviews with The Washington Post. “I’m waiting and I want to help, and I mean, it’s really frustrating.”

Some within city and state government say it’s good to have far more volunteers than hospitals actually need. Hospitals are prioritizing certain specialties more than others, a state health department spokeswoman said: physicians, nurse practitioners, physician assistants, respiratory therapists, respiratory therapist technicians and registered nurses. Government officials added that a state database created for the effort compiles and automatically vets volunteers and checks professional licenses, but individual hospitals or systems are responsible for requesting and assigning staff, along with training and determinations for shifts and potential compensation.

But some volunteers said they’re willing to work for free and perform any task. A few, including Weinhouse, lamented lax communication and the feeling of being in an indefinite holding pattern, even as Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo (D) appears on television most days to describe a worsening crisis and plead for urgent assistance.

“Please come help us in New York now,” Cuomo said last week as the state’s daily death toll passed 250.

It has since more than tripled that, and overall more than 6,200 New Yorkers — nearly three-quarters of them in New York City — have died, as of Wednesday evening.

“You keep on hearing elected officials saying: ‘We’re at war, we’re at war,’ ” said an individual who spent eight years as a first responder in Manhattan and, after submitting his name and qualifications on the volunteer portal March 18, has received only automated responses and has been unable to sign up for EMT shifts. “So if we’re at war, where are our reinforcements?”

That individual was among several who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they feared retribution or because they hadn’t been authorized to speak publicly. If a volunteer is placed, some hospitals include a clause in their contracts that prohibits them from speaking with the media.

In the last two weeks, Weinhouse said, he has reapplied to both the city’s Medical Reserve Corps and state’s database. He submitted his credentials to a hospital chain and this week sent a message to a different hospital, offering to help even with administrative duties. Weeks earlier, he withdrew from a class on directing theater productions, set aside other responsibilities, cleared his schedule. All he does now, he said, is check his email “10 times a day.”

“I’m not blaming anybody,” he said. “But I would hope that since the need is so great, they'd be able to use us in some way.”

‘I’ve just been sitting’
Late last month, Jess Schneider was told a hospital near Central Park had an urgent need for volunteer nurses. Assigned a start date of March 30, she left her home in Boise, Idaho, and made the 38-hour drive east. She arrived in Manhattan, moved into her sister’s apartment, and didn’t start until April 6.

“I raced to get here, and I’ve just been sitting,” Schneider, 43, said Wednesday in a telephone interview from her hospital’s break room. She walked the city, saw a few sights and mostly waited for instructions.

She declined to identify which hospital she was eventually assigned to and said it was important to point out that, as a volunteer, Schneider doesn’t officially represent any health organization.

But, she said, the confusion has only intensified since her first shift. She learned of a dramatic compensation disparity, with some nurses earning $10,000 weekly stipends, she said, and others signing contracts that paid a fraction of that. Schneider said she makes $2,000 per week. Her hospital lacks a sufficient number of N95 masks, she said, and it isn’t testing the ones it has to make sure they fit. Some nurses have refused to work without masks that fit properly, she said.

If there is indeed an abundance of volunteers in the state and city databases, Schneider said, they’re certainly not at her hospital. She said it’s impossible to provide sufficient care to each of her patients simply because of their sheer numbers.

Schneider said that in previous hospital jobs, there was roughly one nurse for every four patients. Here, she said, it’s a dozen patients per nurse, with some rooms crammed with four or five beds. Some nurses signed agreements to work 21 consecutive days, with 12-hour shifts that often last much longer, and no time off.

“I don’t know who’s in charge,” Schneider said, adding that she reported for work at 7 a.m. Wednesday and waited nearly 90 minutes before being given instructions. “It’s total, utter chaos.”

Some health care workers refuse to work without personal protective equipment

Schneider said she has tried to shield patients and their families from her overwhelming stress, though sometimes it spills over.

During her first day, she entered the room of a covid-19 patient who was near death and leaned the sick woman forward so she could look into a tablet and see her family as they said goodbye. Schneider said she felt a flood of emotion coming and needed to walk away. She then apologized to the grieving family because, with the ward short-staffed, Schneider had to check in with other patients.

“It was horrible,” she said two days later. “This is what we’ve been hearing about, and this is real.”

On Wednesday morning, Schneider said she was one of two nurses on a floor with 18 beds, all of them filled.

“You kind of expect a s--- show. I didn’t expect one this big,” she said. But when asked if she regretted volunteering, she paused before saying no. “It’s what we do. I don’t know if every nurse feels like that, but it’s what we do.”

A ‘holding pattern’
Late in Weinhouse’s career, he taught a class at New York University’s teaching hospital. He found himself harping on one tenet of the Hippocratic oath more than the others: that, if needed, a medical professional should always answer the call.

He first recited the pledge when he graduated medical school in 1978, and he said it’s why he volunteered last month. New York needed him, Weinhouse said, though he remains confused about why it hasn’t taken him and the thousands of others up on their willingness to help.

“We're all trying to do what's right,” he said. “But we're all in the same holding pattern for whatever reason.”

When Weinhouse retired three years ago from NYU Langone Medical Center, he knew a traditional retirement wasn’t for him. He loved the theater, and his first volunteer assignment was working as an assistant stage manager for a small, off-Broadway production. He draped his stethoscope, which he’d worn most days for the previous 20 years, on a shelf next to his opera CDs, theater books, and preserved show reviews Weinhouse had written in his spare time.

He said he can remember his walk to work on the first day of his new job in show business, along with those feelings of being overwhelmed but essential. He wanted to direct a show someday, and earlier this year he signed up for a class on theater direction.

“I’m not the person who sits around,” he said. “I don’t like sitting around. I really don’t.”

That was before the coronavirus, though, and Weinhouse followed the soaring numbers of confirmed cases in New York and again felt called to a life he thought he’d left behind. Unconcerned with getting sick himself — other than some mild hypertension, Weinhouse said, he’s healthy — he signed up, quit the stage production, withdrew from the class. He was looking forward to using his old stethoscope again and taking another walk to a new job.

Weinhouse initially expressed a preference for working on overflow hospitals such as the USNS “Comfort” ship or the field hospital built by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers at the Javits Center. But he said he’d work anywhere and do anything: administrative work, organizing an emergency room, scheduling. He said he never asked to be paid.

Without an assignment, Weinhouse spends much of his time watching the news, he said, which reminds him that while people keep dying and hospitals keep filling, his phone isn’t ringing.

“It’s really aggravating. I can’t explain it,” Weinhouse said. “I’d just like the state to explain what’s going on.”"

Gov. Gavin Newsom made the announcement on Rachel Maddow’s MSNBC show Tuesday night. On Wednesday, Newsom announced the state had its largest daily increase of COVID-19 deaths with 68.

“As a nation-state with a capacity to write a check for hundreds of millions — no, billions of dollars — we are in a position to do something bold and big that could be a catalyst to increase supply,” Newsom said.

State officials have signed a contract with BYD North America to deliver the masks, chosen in part because it is a subsidiary of a company based in China, where much of the personal protective gear is made.

The order will include about 150 million N95 masks, which are tight-fitting and designed to protect against particles in the air. The other 50 million masks will be surgical masks, which are loose-fitting and protect against fluids.

California taxpayers will pay $495 million upfront for the masks. The state will pay more as other shipments arrive, with a total estimated payment of $990 million, according to a letter the Newsom administration sent to the Legislature.

The money comes from a portion of the $1 billion aid package the Legislature approved last month, plus another $1.3 billion disaster response emergency fund that Newsom has the authority to spend.

Newsom signed an executive order on Tuesday eliminating sales and other taxes on masks, gloves, eye protection, gowns and other materials. It applies to such materials when they are sold to or purchased by the state.

California has already ordered $1.4 billion worth of personal protective equipment and distributed 41.4 million N95 masks. But the state has had trouble finding enough masks to meet the needs of its nearly 40 million residents. One shipment from Texas had to be sent back because the masks carried mold, Newsom said.

The state also plans to start cleaning masks so health workers can re-use them by partnering with Battelle, an Ohio-based company that says it can clean up to 80,000 masks per day. The masks can be used up to 20 times each, Newsom said.

“We’re already working with hospital system to create the the protocols so they are not throwing all these masks out,” Newsom said.

In Santa Clara County, where the U.S. had one of its first confirmed COVID-19 cases, public health officials are so worried about a shortage of protective gear that they have ordered businesses and individuals to tell the government if they have stockpiles of more than 5,000 gloves and 500 masks. The government promised to keep the figures confidential.

“We can’t rely solely on our state and federal government. We have to turn locally to see what capacity for inventory exists here in our county,” said Dr. Jennifer Tong, hospital surge capacity branch chief for the Santa Clara County Emergency Operations Center.

Likewise, Newsom said the state can’t rely on the federal government, which has sent the state about a million masks so far.

“That’s not an indictment, not a cheap shot. At the end of the day, they don’t have the masks at the national stockpile,” Newsom said on MSNBC.

California has more than 17,800 COVID-19 cases and has seen more than 450 deaths, according to data complied by Johns Hopkins University. Intensive care hospitalizations have been growing at a slower rate than experts had anticipated, leading Newsom to donate 500 ventilators to other states.

For most people, the new coronavirus causes mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough that clear up in two to three weeks. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia and death."

Tips For Social Distancing, Quarantine, And Isolation During An Infectious Disease Outbreak

What Is Social Distancing?

Social distancing is a way to keep people from interacting closely or frequently enough to spread an infectious disease. Schools and other gathering places such as movie theaters may close, and sports events and religious services may be cancelled.

What Is Quarantine?

Quarantine separates and restricts the movement of people who have been exposed to a contagious disease to see if they become sick. It lasts long enough to ensure the person has not contracted an infectious disease.

What Is Isolation?

Isolation prevents the spread of an infectious disease by separating people who are sick from those who are not. It lasts as long as the disease is contagious.

What To Expect: Typical Reactions

Everyone reacts differently to stressful situations such as an infectious disease outbreak that requires social distancing, quarantine, or isolation. People may feel:

•	⁠Anxiety, worry, or fear related to:
•	⁠Your own health status
•	⁠The health status of others whom you may have exposed to the disease
•	⁠The resentment that your friends and family may feel if they need to go into quarantine as a result of contact with you
•	⁠The experience of monitoring yourself, or being monitored by others for signs and symptoms of the disease
•	⁠Time taken off from work and the potential loss of income and job security
•	⁠The challenges of securing things you need, such as groceries and personal care items
•	⁠Concern about being able to effectively care for children or others in your care
•	⁠Uncertainty or frustration about how long you will need to remain in this situation, and uncertainty about the future
•	⁠Loneliness associated with feeling cut off from the world and from loved ones
•	⁠Anger if you think you were exposed to the disease because of others’ negligence
•	⁠Boredom and frustration because you may not be able to work or engage in regular day-to-day activities
•	⁠Uncertainty or ambivalence about the situation
•	⁠A desire to use alcohol or drugs to cope
•	⁠Symptoms of depression, such as feelings of hopelessness, changes in appetite, or sleeping too little or too much
•	⁠Symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), such as intrusive distressing memories, flashbacks (reliving the event), nightmares, changes in thoughts and mood, and being easily startled.

Ways To Support Yourself During Social Distancing, Quarantine, and Isolation

UNDERSTAND THE RISK

Consider the real risk of harm to yourself and others around you. The public perception of risk during a situation such as an infectious disease outbreak is often inaccurate. Media coverage may create the impression that people are in immediate danger when really the risk for infection may be very low. Take steps to get the facts:

•	⁠Stay up to date on what is happening, while limiting your media exposure. Avoid watching or listening to news reports 24/7 since this tends to increase anxiety and worry. Remember that children are especially affected by what they hear and see on television.
•	⁠Look to credible sources for information on the infectious disease outbreak.

BE YOUR OWN ADVOCATE

Speaking out about your needs is particularly important if you are in quarantine, since you may not be in a hospital or other facility where your basic needs are met. Ensure you have what you need to feel safe, secure, and comfortable.

•	⁠Work with local, state, or national health officials to find out how you can arrange for groceries and toiletries to be delivered to your home as needed.
•	⁠Inform health care providers or health authorities of any needed medications and work with them to ensure that you continue to receive those medications.

EDUCATE YOURSELF

Health care providers and health authorities should provide information on the disease, its diagnosis, and treatment.

•	⁠Do not be afraid to ask questions—clear communication with a health care provider may help reduce any distress associated with social distancing, quarantine, or isolation.
•	⁠Ask for written information when available.
•	⁠Ask a family member or friend to obtain information in the event that you are unable to secure this information on your own.

WORK WITH YOUR EMPLOYER TO REDUCE FINANCIAL STRESS

If you’re unable to work during this time, you may experience stress related to your job status or financial situation.

•	⁠Provide your employer with a clear explanation of why you are away from work.
•	⁠Contact the U.S. Department of Labor tollfree at 1-866-487-2365 about the Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA), which allows U.S. employees up to 12 weeks of unpaid leave for serious medical conditions, or to care for a family member with a serious medical condition.
•	⁠Contact your utility providers, cable and Internet provider, and other companies from whom you get monthly bills to explain your situation and request alternative bill payment arrangements as needed.

CONNECT WITH OTHERS

Reaching out to people you trust is one of the best ways to reduce anxiety, depression, loneliness, and boredom during social distancing, quarantine, and isolation. You can:

•	⁠Use the telephone, email, text messaging, and social media to connect with friends, family, and others.
•	⁠Talk “face to face” with friends and loved ones using Skype or FaceTime.
•	⁠If approved by health authorities and your health care providers, arrange for your friends and loved ones to bring you newspapers, movies, and books.
•	⁠Sign up for emergency alerts via text or email to ensure you get updates as soon as they are available.
•	⁠Call SAMHSA’s free 24-hour Disaster Distress Helpline at 1-800-985-5990, if you feel lonely or need support.
•	⁠Use the Internet, radio, and television to keep up with local, national, and world events.
•	⁠If you need to connect with someone because of an ongoing alcohol or drug problem, consider calling your local Alcoholics Anonymous or Narcotics Anonymous offices.

TALK TO YOUR DOCTOR

If you are in a medical facility, you may have access to health care providers who can answer your questions. However, if you are quarantined at home, and you’re worried about physical symptoms you or your loved ones may be experiencing, call your doctor or other health care provider:

•	⁠Ask your provider whether it would be possible to schedule remote appointments via Skype or FaceTime for mental health, substance use, or physical health needs.

USE PRACTICAL WAYS TO COPE AND RELAX

•	⁠Relax your body often by doing things that work for you-take deep breaths, stretch, meditate or pray, or engage in activities you enjoy.
•	⁠Pace yourself between stressful activities, and do something fun after a hard task.
•	⁠Talk about your experiences and feelings to loved ones and friends, if you find it helpful.
•	⁠Maintain a sense of hope and positive thinking; consider keeping a journal where you write down things you are grateful for or that are going well

> “The majority is clearly European,” said Harm van Bakel, a geneticist at Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, who co-wrote a study awaiting peer review.

> A separate team at N.Y.U. Grossman School of Medicine came to strikingly similar conclusions, despite studying a different group of cases. Both teams analyzed genomes from coronaviruses taken from New Yorkers starting in mid-March.

> The research revealed a previously hidden spread of the virus that might have been detected if aggressive testing programs had been put in place. On Jan. 31, President Trump barred foreign nationals from entering the country if they had been in China — the site of the virus’s first known outbreak — during the previous two weeks."

Since the very beginnings of the Satanic Panic in the 1980s, believers in Satanic Ritual Abuse have been obsessed with tunnels. One of the most memorable features of the investigation into McMartin Preschool in Manhattan Beach, California, were reports of underground tunnels where the McMartins brought children to sexually assault them. The McMartins, of course, were found innocent after a three year trial and no one ever found any damn tunnels. Including Gloria Steinem, who helped fund an excavation of the area around the preschool searching for them.

And now, thirty-plus years later, we're back to the damn tunnels. Because the QAnon idiots have recently turned their attention to a theory that Central Park is currently teeming with *mole children* who had been living in underground tunnels, and who have recently been rescued by the US military, on the orders of one Donald J. Trump.

It is, perhaps, one of the stupidest theories to have come from these people, and that's saying a lot.

So here's what the deal is (*I think*): They believe that the COVID-19 epidemic is a big ruse meant to keep people in their houses while the US military rescues thousands of children from underground tunnels, some of which they claim are right underneath Central Park. These children were, I guess, transported to the Navy hospital ships — the *USNS Comfort* in New York and the *USNS Mercy* in Los Angeles. Now, they claim, these children are being treated in all of the tents that were set up in Central Park [to treat people with COVID-19](https://abcnews.go.com/Health/central-park-site-hospital-coronavirus-patients/story?id=69893623)."

Anyone defending the WHO at this point is in denial. Yes of course countries/goverments could have prepared better but fact is that the WHO has majorly dropped the ball on this one. I cannot imagine that there will be no consequences for them after what happened.

Let me be clear: You absolutely deserve your mother's rage. You have endangered your whole family *for funsies?* She raised you better than this. I know literally everyone else on this thread has already hammered similar thoughts into your head at this point, but as an actual adult you have made my blood boil by your irresponsibility.

Sure, you'll likely be fine. But your family? If they've been exposed, and they get sick, any injury or death they suffer will be 100% your fault. Oh and you know that they have various conditions that make them particularly vulnerable to this virus too? Knowing that your cousin's GF is sick (which in these times, its stupid to assume its not COVID-19)? Did your mother drop you on your head when you were a baby?

Okay. Advice time.

Keep in contact with your health care provider and follow their instructions on what medications to take for your symptoms and how long you should isolate yourself. Maybe see if you can go isolate with your equally-idiot cousin who is just as much of a twat as you are. Most importantly, and again I really shouldn't have to say this but I'm going to reiterate it for you because you clearly have no relationship with common sense, DON'T GO AND FUCKING HANG OUT WITH PEOPLE.

Let me help you spot the difference:

  -  lady in charge of public education that hates public education (Devos)

  -  the guy who said he was unqualified to lead the agency he now leads (Carson)

  -  the guys who couldn't remeber the dept he now leads (Perry)

  -  the coal lobbyist/lawyer in charge of the EPA

  -  the guy in charge of US public lands who hates public lands

  -  the tax cut for the rich that threw a few peanuts at the middle class so Trump voters wouldn't feel so stupid defending it as most of it goes to the rich and it drives up the debt they spent the last 8 years whining about.

  -  the president doesn't even read reports that are made FOR HIM so that he can lead the country

  -  the president spent how long downplaying the coronavirus?

  -  he used Ukraine military aid as a bargaining chip to secure a personal favor from Zelensky to help him politically (abuse of power)

  -  his son in law is qualified for nothing he is in charge of

  -  the compulsive lying about everything great and small

  -  going on InfoWars (you know, the guy that convinced his followers that Sandy Hook was fake)

  -   The Environmental Protection Agency announces that it will not ban the pesticide chlorpyrifos, despite its connection to numerous disorders in infants and older children.

  -  US intelligence warned Trump in January and February as he dismissed coronavirus threat

  -  his healthcare ""fix"" (remember it will be better and cheaper) was kicking 20 million off healthcare

  -  the fact that he spent f'n years pushing his ""Birther"" BS with no evidence

  -  the fact that he helps spread conspiracy theories like ""millions of illegals voted in California""

  -  what he did to the Kurds

  -  Trump said he believes Ukraine interfered in 2016 election because 'Putin told me'

  -  Political appointees at the Interior Department have sought to play up climate pollution from California wildfires while downplaying emissions from fossil fuels as a way of promoting more logging in the nation’s forests, internal emails obtained by the Guardian reveal.

  -  Trump has personally and repeatedly instructed the Postmaster General to double shipping rates for Amazon, in an attempt to inflict billions of dollars of new costs on founder and CEO Jeff Bezos, who also owns the Washington Post. “Some administration officials,” reported the Post in May 2018, “say several of Trump’s attacks aimed at Amazon have come in response to articles in The Post that he didn’t like.”

  -  The president is a threat to law and order. As New York magazine’s Jonathan Chait has observed: “On at least eight occasions, he has encouraged his supporters — including members of the armed forces — to attack his political opponents.” In addition, a bevy of domestic terrorists arrested since 2016 have cited either Trump’s name, his inflammatory rhetoric, or both.

Saskatoon continues to be the hotspot of the province, with Regina and the North picking up a few cases nearly each and every day.  While the province as a whole is doing well, it could be said that Saskatoon is not.  Saskatoon now has nearly 50% of all cases in the province.  It's beginning to look like unless Saskatoon and Regina take steeper actions, a steady stream of infections may be here to stay.  The virus spreads according to the measures we take.  If we do not adjust our measures, we shouldn't expect the spread to alter.  Unless we get herd immunity, but that is a very long ways off given our rate of spread.

Also of note: the SHA provided a presentation to the public on the epidemiological modelling they had done for the province.  They evaluated three scenarios - a low, mid, and high range spread scenario.  The low range scenario resulted in 153 000 infections, and 3075 deaths.  The mid range scenario resulted in 262 000 infections, and 5260 deaths.  The high range scenario resulted in 408 000 infections, 8370 deaths, with 4265 in hospital simultaneously, and 1280 in intensive care.

These are models, and all models are wrong.  However, all models provide insight.  It might seem like these models are detached from reality, but let's remember that we have not even had COVID-19 in Saskatchewan for a month yet.  There is a long ways to go, with plenty of opportunities for the spread to intensify.  

I remain, however, cautiously optimistic.  In some cases, the models are far beyond what happens.  The best case scenario modelled showed 13% infected.  Currently in Italy, 0.23% have been infected.  New York State, the epicenter of the globe for Coronavirus, has 0.77% infected.  It's very difficult to see how we could go from around 10-20 cases per day, to something worse than New York State on a per capita basis, by more than one order of magnitude.  Let's also remember that in the Ebola outbreak on the West Africa coast a few years ago, the WHO said there could be as many as 1.4 million infected.  There ended up being about 25 000.  COVID-19 models around the world continue to be revised to have fewer infections and deaths.  Most notably, in the USA, which reacted very slowly to the epidemic, they originally predicted over a million dead.  Then the number dropped.  I believe Dr. Fauci has been talking about 100 000 to 200 000 dead now.  Far less than the original numbers.  

However, that doesn't mean we should let our guard down.  This epidemic started from a single patient.  And all it takes is one for it to start back up again.  We need to remember that for the days to come.  Let us plan for the worst, but hope for the best."

* Trump has taken full authority to command which businesses get which contracts.

* In the middle of a pandemic - literally - states are having to fight it out amongst each other in a bidding war for medical supplies. Because of Trump, the supplies is handled by middlemen who end up jacking up the prices because the federal government is bidding against the inidividual states as well. Meaning the leftover profits remain with the distributors. And like no suprise one of the major distributors is a former Trump donor and major republican gop donor.

* Then its the cure Hydrocloroquine. It turns out Trump whole family has investments in the company that produces one of the brandnames for the ""cure"". And another distributor paid trumps lawyer a million dollars. I mean just a coincidence that he is promoting that specific ""cure"" everywhere regardless of many scientists warning him not to.

In Spagna 6278 nuovi casi, mille in più rispetto a ieri, per totali 148.220. 14.792 le vittime, 747 oggi.

In Italia: +3836 casi, ottocento più di ieri; totale 139.422. 17.669 le vittime, di cui 542 oggi. Anche oggi Francia, Spagna, Germania e Regno Unito registrano incrementi giornalieri nei contagi superiori al nostro.

Bipolare come sempre, la Francia oggi registra 3881 nuovi casi, oltre settemila meno di ieri, per complessivi 112.950. Le vittime sono 10.869, di cui 541 oggi; manca però il dato sui decessi nelle case di riposo, che oggi non è stato aggiornato per problemi tecnici.

Il Regno Unito registra la sua peggior giornata di sempre, sia in termini di nuovi casi (5491, 1800 più di ieri, che portano il totale a 60.733) sia di decessi (938, che portano il totale a 7097). Il sito del *Daily Mail* titola: “potrebbe andare peggio”.

Il Belgio conta 1209 nuovi casi (170 in meno rispetto a ieri) per totali 23.403, superando di misura la Svizzera. Le vittime sono 2240, di cui 205 nella giornata di oggi (il peggior bilancio giornaliero finora, considerato che i 403 di ieri erano in realtà frutto dell’aggiunta di 241 decessi in case di riposo in precedenza non conteggiati).

Male anche in Svizzera, dove si registrano 1027 nuovi casi, oltre 400 in più rispetto a ieri (totale 23.280) e 74 vittime (totale 895).

Nei Paesi Bassi si registrano 969 nuovi contagi (duecento più di ieri) che portano il totale oltre i 20.000 (20.549). Le vittime sono 2248, di cui 147 nella giornata di oggi.

In Portogallo 699 nuovi casi, una decina meno di ieri, portano il totale a 13.141. 380 le vittime.

L’Austria conta invece 303 nuovi contagi, una quindicina meno di ieri, per complessivi 12.942. 273 le vittime.

Sempre peggio in Svezia, che dichiara ufficialmente 726 nuovi casi, 240 in più rispetto a ieri e maggior incremento giornaliero di sempre, per totali 8419 (epperò i test in Svezia, per milione di abitanti, sono poco più della metà di quelli effettuati dalla Danimarca ed un quarto di quelli effettuati dalla Norvegia). 687 le vittime, di cui 96 solo oggi.

In Russia 1175 nuovi casi (una ventina più di ieri e massimo incremento di sempre) portano il totale oltre quota ottomila (8672) con 63 vittime.

La Norvegia registra zero nuovi casi od oggi non ha aggiornato, totale 6086. 101 le vittime.

In Irlanda 365 nuovi casi (una ventina più di ieri) portano il totale oltre i seimila (6074). 235 le vittime.

La Danimarca conta 315 nuovi contagi, una ventina più di ieri, che portano il totale oltre i cinquemila (5386). 218 le vittime.

Oltre i cinquemila (5221) anche la Repubblica Ceca, con 204 nuovi contagi (un’ottantina in più rispetto a ieri). 99 le vittime.

Così anche la Polonia, con 357 nuovi casi (un centinaio in più rispetto a ieri) per totali 5205. 159 le vittime.

In Romania 344 nuovi casi, una quindicina meno di ieri, portano il totale a 4761, 210 le vittime.

64 nuovi casi (la metà rispetto a ieri) in Lussemburgo, che supera quota tremila (3034). 46 le vittime.

La Serbia conta 219 nuovi casi (una trentina in meno rispetto a ieri) per complessivi 2666. 65 le vittime.

La Finlandia registra 179 nuovi casi (una cinquantina in più rispetto a ieri) che portano il totale a 2487. 40 le vittime.

La Grecia conta 52 nuovi casi (una ventina meno di quelli di ieri), totale 1884. 83 le vittime.

L’Ucraina conta 206 nuovi casi (totale 1668), con 52 vittime.

L’Islanda registra 30 nuovi casi, pochi di più di ieri (totale 1616), sei le vittime.

Altrove, meno di 1500 casi.

Paesi extraeuropei peggio messi, usando come metro il numero di vittime:

* USA, con 425.000 casi (25.400 oggi, i 400.000 li hanno superati di misura ieri notte) e 14.604 vittime (1763 oggi, finora; ieri notte gli USA hanno sfiorato i duemila decessi in ventiquattr’ore – 1970 – e non è da escludersi che questa notte raggiungano questa funesta soglia);
* Iran con i suoi numeri alternativi;
* Turchia con 38.000 casi (4117 oggi) e 812 vittime (87 oggi);
* Brasile con 16.000 casi (1893 oggi) e 800 vittime (114 oggi);
* Canada con 19.200 casi (1173 oggi) e 427 vittime (46 oggi);
* Ecuador con 4450 casi e 242 vittime (ma dalle notizie da incubo che girano da giorni si direbbe siano molti di più, a meno che non siano esagerate);
* Indonesia con 2956 casi e 240 vittime;
* Algeria con 1572 casi e 205 vittime;
* Corea del Sud con 10.400 casi e 200 vittime;
* Filippine con 3870 casi e 182 vittime;
* India con 5916 casi e 178 vittime;
* Messico con 2785 casi e 141 vittime;
* Perù con 4342 casi e 121 vittime;
* Repubblica Dominicana con 2111 casi e 108 vittime;
* Egitto con 1560 casi e 103 vittime;
* Giappone con 4257 casi e 93 vittime;
* Marocco con 1275 casi e 93 vittime.

In tutto il mondo, oggi 75.000 nuovi casi (superato il milione e mezzo, 1.506.000, anche se probabilmente Italia, Spagna e Stati Uniti hanno in realtà, ciascuno, questo numero di contagi, e l’Iran anche di più) e 6000 vittime (totale 88.000)."

Sorry for the late post today, the info seems to be coming out later and later recently. Also, the City of Austin [added some new stats](https://austin.maps.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html#/39e4f8d4acb0433baae6d15a931fa984), finally, to the dashboard. Not anything about testing. Don't get excited! They are now telling us about hospitalizations and recoveries though. Also, they went back to the damn chart showing ""from date of onset."" It makes a bell-curve... because no one with symptom onset today will get test results back for at least a few days. Many with onset today, won't even think about it for a week. This graph is misleading at best.

First, let me note the many limitations we are still dealing with that make this data potentially hard to form opinions with:

* We do not have information on the rate of testing or duration of time it takes to get results.
* We do not have testing kit criteria being used.
* Addition of spring breakers at an unknown time to the data.
* No information on how soon the spring breakers, and those exposed to them, were notified and quarantined.
* The list can really go on forever; we can always use more information and more transparency.

There are 75 people hospitalized in Travis county that are confirmed COVID-19 cases. Out of the confirmed COVID-19 cases, the county reports that 106 have recovered.

The average daily rate of change since we crossed 100 cases is 13.1%. Today’s rate of change is 7.8%. It is my opinion that we are currently still seeing how well we **had** been doing. We, unfortunately, won't see the spring breakers really impact the rate of change for another 1 to 7 days. That is when the people they infected will start to show up in the data. Hopefully this doesn't happen and our trend continues to flatten out.

Lastly, the death toll remains at 7. This continues to be fairly impressive, but I fear it will get worse. Health officials said the fifth death from COVID-19 was a man **in his 30s**, while the sixth death was a woman in her 50s. (70s - 3, 50s - 1, 40s - 1, 30s- 1) -- There is no current information on the 7th death. I highlight the age of the 30 year old to just remind everyone that, while the odds are much lower for that age group, we are not immune.

Lastly, this is anecdotal, but a local group of physicians posted on reddit today. [u/Shahnawazalpha](https://www.reddit.com/user/Shahnawazalpha/) had this to say about a recent discussion he had with health officials.

>I've spoken a member of the major's advisory committee, and I was told that our current testing capacity is 300-400/day, but it is being underutilized. I sense that they don't appreciate that we need to try and find as many positive cases as we can and are adhering blindly to CDC testing criterion. The ""test positivity"" rate in South Korea was 2.2% (so 97.8% of people tested were negative). That represents the wide net they case. Ours is 12.5%, which means we're not testing as aggressively as the only country in the world that was able to bend the curve convincingly.

If true, this is disheartening. Make sure to reach out to our elected officials and let them KNOW that we want testing. We want aggressive testing, and we want it now. You can [GO HERE](https://www.austintexas.gov/contact-us) and find contact information for you district council member. I highly recommend contacting them.

Be safe Austin. Take care of each other.

Other information and data sources are below:

The amount of COVID-19 testing is increasing by approximately 10% each day, according to Gov. Abbott. In Austin, Dr. Zerwas said there are 1,359 hospital beds available for COVID-19 patients, and 153 ICU beds.

Tips For Social Distancing, Quarantine, And Isolation During An Infectious Disease Outbreak

What Is Social Distancing?

Social distancing is a way to keep people from interacting closely or frequently enough to spread an infectious disease. Schools and other gathering places such as movie theaters may close, and sports events and religious services may be cancelled.

What Is Quarantine?

Quarantine separates and restricts the movement of people who have been exposed to a contagious disease to see if they become sick. It lasts long enough to ensure the person has not contracted an infectious disease.

What Is Isolation?

Isolation prevents the spread of an infectious disease by separating people who are sick from those who are not. It lasts as long as the disease is contagious.

What To Expect: Typical Reactions

Everyone reacts differently to stressful situations such as an infectious disease outbreak that requires social distancing, quarantine, or isolation. People may feel:

•	⁠Anxiety, worry, or fear related to:
•	⁠Your own health status
•	⁠The health status of others whom you may have exposed to the disease
•	⁠The resentment that your friends and family may feel if they need to go into quarantine as a result of contact with you
•	⁠The experience of monitoring yourself, or being monitored by others for signs and symptoms of the disease
•	⁠Time taken off from work and the potential loss of income and job security
•	⁠The challenges of securing things you need, such as groceries and personal care items
•	⁠Concern about being able to effectively care for children or others in your care
•	⁠Uncertainty or frustration about how long you will need to remain in this situation, and uncertainty about the future
•	⁠Loneliness associated with feeling cut off from the world and from loved ones
•	⁠Anger if you think you were exposed to the disease because of others’ negligence
•	⁠Boredom and frustration because you may not be able to work or engage in regular day-to-day activities
•	⁠Uncertainty or ambivalence about the situation
•	⁠A desire to use alcohol or drugs to cope
•	⁠Symptoms of depression, such as feelings of hopelessness, changes in appetite, or sleeping too little or too much
•	⁠Symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), such as intrusive distressing memories, flashbacks (reliving the event), nightmares, changes in thoughts and mood, and being easily startled.

Ways To Support Yourself During Social Distancing, Quarantine, and Isolation

UNDERSTAND THE RISK

Consider the real risk of harm to yourself and others around you. The public perception of risk during a situation such as an infectious disease outbreak is often inaccurate. Media coverage may create the impression that people are in immediate danger when really the risk for infection may be very low. Take steps to get the facts:

•	⁠Stay up to date on what is happening, while limiting your media exposure. Avoid watching or listening to news reports 24/7 since this tends to increase anxiety and worry. Remember that children are especially affected by what they hear and see on television.
•	⁠Look to credible sources for information on the infectious disease outbreak.

BE YOUR OWN ADVOCATE

Speaking out about your needs is particularly important if you are in quarantine, since you may not be in a hospital or other facility where your basic needs are met. Ensure you have what you need to feel safe, secure, and comfortable.

•	⁠Work with local, state, or national health officials to find out how you can arrange for groceries and toiletries to be delivered to your home as needed.
•	⁠Inform health care providers or health authorities of any needed medications and work with them to ensure that you continue to receive those medications.

EDUCATE YOURSELF

Health care providers and health authorities should provide information on the disease, its diagnosis, and treatment.

•	⁠Do not be afraid to ask questions—clear communication with a health care provider may help reduce any distress associated with social distancing, quarantine, or isolation.
•	⁠Ask for written information when available.
•	⁠Ask a family member or friend to obtain information in the event that you are unable to secure this information on your own.

WORK WITH YOUR EMPLOYER TO REDUCE FINANCIAL STRESS

If you’re unable to work during this time, you may experience stress related to your job status or financial situation.

•	⁠Provide your employer with a clear explanation of why you are away from work.
•	⁠Contact the U.S. Department of Labor tollfree at 1-866-487-2365 about the Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA), which allows U.S. employees up to 12 weeks of unpaid leave for serious medical conditions, or to care for a family member with a serious medical condition.
•	⁠Contact your utility providers, cable and Internet provider, and other companies from whom you get monthly bills to explain your situation and request alternative bill payment arrangements as needed.

CONNECT WITH OTHERS

Reaching out to people you trust is one of the best ways to reduce anxiety, depression, loneliness, and boredom during social distancing, quarantine, and isolation. You can:

•	⁠Use the telephone, email, text messaging, and social media to connect with friends, family, and others.
•	⁠Talk “face to face” with friends and loved ones using Skype or FaceTime.
•	⁠If approved by health authorities and your health care providers, arrange for your friends and loved ones to bring you newspapers, movies, and books.
•	⁠Sign up for emergency alerts via text or email to ensure you get updates as soon as they are available.
•	⁠Call SAMHSA’s free 24-hour Disaster Distress Helpline at 1-800-985-5990, if you feel lonely or need support.
•	⁠Use the Internet, radio, and television to keep up with local, national, and world events.
•	⁠If you need to connect with someone because of an ongoing alcohol or drug problem, consider calling your local Alcoholics Anonymous or Narcotics Anonymous offices.

TALK TO YOUR DOCTOR

If you are in a medical facility, you may have access to health care providers who can answer your questions. However, if you are quarantined at home, and you’re worried about physical symptoms you or your loved ones may be experiencing, call your doctor or other health care provider:

•	⁠Ask your provider whether it would be possible to schedule remote appointments via Skype or FaceTime for mental health, substance use, or physical health needs.

USE PRACTICAL WAYS TO COPE AND RELAX

•	⁠Relax your body often by doing things that work for you-take deep breaths, stretch, meditate or pray, or engage in activities you enjoy.
•	⁠Pace yourself between stressful activities, and do something fun after a hard task.
•	⁠Talk about your experiences and feelings to loved ones and friends, if you find it helpful.
•	⁠Maintain a sense of hope and positive thinking; consider keeping a journal where you write down things you are grateful for or that are going well

A quick Google search brings up the shite that is The Scum (sorry The S\*n - Liverpool supporter here) and of course the Daily Mail with the headlines saying that Trump has sent over 200 ventilators. This thus far, is **not true**. They are the only ones saying this.

They are going on this literal statement from the Orangina ""The UK called today and they wanted to know would it be possible to get 200 and we're going to work it out, we've got to work it out. They've been great partners. United Kingdom. And we're gonna work it out for them. So they wanted 200, they needed them desperately.""

This by no means says that anything at all has been sent to the UK at all. And Trump saying ""we're going to work it out"" is likely as honest and truthful as anything else he says. Which lets be honest is practically nothing (especially when it comes to this whole pandemic where in fact he has been arguably been dangerous).

All other reports that I have seen such as from ITV and the Business Insider have just stated that this all Trump said, showing no indication of it actually happening.

Does it say anything about those 1000 blood donors? Is it a blind sample - or were the donors people who had previously been infected? (or thought they were infected). 

In america they're asking people who were already infected to donate blood for antibody testing. 

\-3.5% of people who think they were infected, actually being infected. Is a lot different than

Again, this is just 1 piece of evidence, there are more such as 21 million cell phone users being gone, although it can't exactly be attributed to china lying about numbers. There's also evidence to suggest the virus has been found in November, which clearly shows that the Chinese authorities covered up the virus, nevermind when China was saying at the beginning that they didn't find human to human transmission, even though the nation of Taiwan did, reported to to the UN and it was ignored. The Chinese communist party was lying all this time, it's delusional to believe that this authoritarian regime which suppresses freedom of speech and civil liberties is actually telling the truth this time. 

explanation of the virus being found early on:

Tips For Social Distancing, Quarantine, And Isolation During An Infectious Disease Outbreak

What Is Social Distancing?

Social distancing is a way to keep people from interacting closely or frequently enough to spread an infectious disease. Schools and other gathering places such as movie theaters may close, and sports events and religious services may be cancelled.

What Is Quarantine?

Quarantine separates and restricts the movement of people who have been exposed to a contagious disease to see if they become sick. It lasts long enough to ensure the person has not contracted an infectious disease.

What Is Isolation?

Isolation prevents the spread of an infectious disease by separating people who are sick from those who are not. It lasts as long as the disease is contagious.

What To Expect: Typical Reactions

Everyone reacts differently to stressful situations such as an infectious disease outbreak that requires social distancing, quarantine, or isolation. People may feel:

•	⁠Anxiety, worry, or fear related to:
•	⁠Your own health status
•	⁠The health status of others whom you may have exposed to the disease
•	⁠The resentment that your friends and family may feel if they need to go into quarantine as a result of contact with you
•	⁠The experience of monitoring yourself, or being monitored by others for signs and symptoms of the disease
•	⁠Time taken off from work and the potential loss of income and job security
•	⁠The challenges of securing things you need, such as groceries and personal care items
•	⁠Concern about being able to effectively care for children or others in your care
•	⁠Uncertainty or frustration about how long you will need to remain in this situation, and uncertainty about the future
•	⁠Loneliness associated with feeling cut off from the world and from loved ones
•	⁠Anger if you think you were exposed to the disease because of others’ negligence
•	⁠Boredom and frustration because you may not be able to work or engage in regular day-to-day activities
•	⁠Uncertainty or ambivalence about the situation
•	⁠A desire to use alcohol or drugs to cope
•	⁠Symptoms of depression, such as feelings of hopelessness, changes in appetite, or sleeping too little or too much
•	⁠Symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), such as intrusive distressing memories, flashbacks (reliving the event), nightmares, changes in thoughts and mood, and being easily startled.

Ways To Support Yourself During Social Distancing, Quarantine, and Isolation

UNDERSTAND THE RISK

Consider the real risk of harm to yourself and others around you. The public perception of risk during a situation such as an infectious disease outbreak is often inaccurate. Media coverage may create the impression that people are in immediate danger when really the risk for infection may be very low. Take steps to get the facts:

•	⁠Stay up to date on what is happening, while limiting your media exposure. Avoid watching or listening to news reports 24/7 since this tends to increase anxiety and worry. Remember that children are especially affected by what they hear and see on television.
•	⁠Look to credible sources for information on the infectious disease outbreak.

BE YOUR OWN ADVOCATE

Speaking out about your needs is particularly important if you are in quarantine, since you may not be in a hospital or other facility where your basic needs are met. Ensure you have what you need to feel safe, secure, and comfortable.

•	⁠Work with local, state, or national health officials to find out how you can arrange for groceries and toiletries to be delivered to your home as needed.
•	⁠Inform health care providers or health authorities of any needed medications and work with them to ensure that you continue to receive those medications.

EDUCATE YOURSELF

Health care providers and health authorities should provide information on the disease, its diagnosis, and treatment.

•	⁠Do not be afraid to ask questions—clear communication with a health care provider may help reduce any distress associated with social distancing, quarantine, or isolation.
•	⁠Ask for written information when available.
•	⁠Ask a family member or friend to obtain information in the event that you are unable to secure this information on your own.

WORK WITH YOUR EMPLOYER TO REDUCE FINANCIAL STRESS

If you’re unable to work during this time, you may experience stress related to your job status or financial situation.

•	⁠Provide your employer with a clear explanation of why you are away from work.
•	⁠Contact the U.S. Department of Labor tollfree at 1-866-487-2365 about the Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA), which allows U.S. employees up to 12 weeks of unpaid leave for serious medical conditions, or to care for a family member with a serious medical condition.
•	⁠Contact your utility providers, cable and Internet provider, and other companies from whom you get monthly bills to explain your situation and request alternative bill payment arrangements as needed.

CONNECT WITH OTHERS

Reaching out to people you trust is one of the best ways to reduce anxiety, depression, loneliness, and boredom during social distancing, quarantine, and isolation. You can:

•	⁠Use the telephone, email, text messaging, and social media to connect with friends, family, and others.
•	⁠Talk “face to face” with friends and loved ones using Skype or FaceTime.
•	⁠If approved by health authorities and your health care providers, arrange for your friends and loved ones to bring you newspapers, movies, and books.
•	⁠Sign up for emergency alerts via text or email to ensure you get updates as soon as they are available.
•	⁠Call SAMHSA’s free 24-hour Disaster Distress Helpline at 1-800-985-5990, if you feel lonely or need support.
•	⁠Use the Internet, radio, and television to keep up with local, national, and world events.
•	⁠If you need to connect with someone because of an ongoing alcohol or drug problem, consider calling your local Alcoholics Anonymous or Narcotics Anonymous offices.

TALK TO YOUR DOCTOR

If you are in a medical facility, you may have access to health care providers who can answer your questions. However, if you are quarantined at home, and you’re worried about physical symptoms you or your loved ones may be experiencing, call your doctor or other health care provider:

•	⁠Ask your provider whether it would be possible to schedule remote appointments via Skype or FaceTime for mental health, substance use, or physical health needs.

USE PRACTICAL WAYS TO COPE AND RELAX

•	⁠Relax your body often by doing things that work for you-take deep breaths, stretch, meditate or pray, or engage in activities you enjoy.
•	⁠Pace yourself between stressful activities, and do something fun after a hard task.
•	⁠Talk about your experiences and feelings to loved ones and friends, if you find it helpful.
•	⁠Maintain a sense of hope and positive thinking; consider keeping a journal where you write down things you are grateful for or that are going well

FAQ

Q: Why is your data different than OP's?

A: I pull my data from the [Ohio Coronavirus website](https://coronavirus.ohio.gov/wps/portal/gov/covid-19/home/dashboard) via a spreadsheet they update daily. That gives different numbers than what OP posts. From my understanding, rather than just saying ""we have 400 new cases today"" they backdate some of the cases to the day they likely actually contracted the virus. So the total remains the same, but the daily amount changes. For example, on 4/7 the number of cases on 4/6 was 56. On 4/8 the number of cases on 4/6 went up to 137."

2020-04-08,incorruptible61,CoronavirusCA,20,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoronavirusCA/comments/fxclrk/california_wont_be_lifting_coronavirus_stayathome/fmtqqvp/,"SAN FRANCISCO —  Even as California sees glimmers of hope amid [the coronavirus outbreak,](https://www.latimes.com/projects/california-coronavirus-cases-tracking-outbreak/#nt=0PromoSuperLeadLarge-1col-7030col1-main) authorities warn that the Golden State won’t be getting back to normal [anytime soon.](https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2020-04-07/california-coronavirus-curve-bending-gavin-newsom)

Officials expect months more of some [social distancing policies ](https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2020-04-07/coronavirus-face-covering-order-los-angeles-mayor-garcetti)and warn that lifting the strict rules too early could worsen the health crisis.

The public should realize that coronavirus cases [are likely to rise](https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2020-04-07/california-coronavirus-curve-bending-gavin-newsom) when stay-at-home orders are eased, officials said.

“There will definitely be individuals who will get sick. And because there are individuals who get sick, there will be individuals who die after the order is released, unless we come up with a foolproof immunization, which is highly unlikely,” said Dr. Jeffrey Smith, Santa Clara County executive officer.

Smith on Tuesday told that county’s Board of Supervisors that he did not expect there would be “any sports games until at least Thanksgiving, and we’d be lucky to have them by Thanksgiving. This is not something that’s going to be easy to do.”

In fact, it’s unlikely the new coronavirus will be completely eradicated, and the disease could become seasonal, Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, told CBS this week.

That would make it unlike a different deadly coronavirus scare of the past, the virus that caused [severe acute respiratory syndrome](https://www.cdc.gov/dotw/sars/index.html) in 2003, which killed 774 people worldwide and was fully contained within months.

On Monday, Fauci said getting back to normal would mean something different. There will be a gradual process by which society can begin to function again, he said during a [news conference](https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-coronavirus-task-force-briefing-transcript-april-6), but “if you want to get to pre-coronavirus, that might not ever happen in the sense of the fact that the threat is there.”

## Improving trends

Silicon Valley health officials are now [expressing more confidence](https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2020-04-07/california-coronavirus-curve-bending-gavin-newsom) that the shelter-in-place order implemented March 16 is working to curb the spread of the virus. Instead of projecting 50,000 coronavirus cases by May 1, the stay-at-home order may limit the number of cases in Santa Clara County to 2,500 to 12,000, according to a new estimate.

In addition, [Santa Clara County — the original epicenter](https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2020-03-25/coronavirus-why-santa-clara-became-california-epicenter-pandemic) of California’s coronavirus outbreak, where more than 1,200 cases have been reported and more than 40 deaths — may now be on track to have enough hospital beds to handle more COVID-19 patients in the coming weeks, the county public health officer said Tuesday.

## What’s next?

There are no easy answers about when state officials could begin to dial back the strict stay-at-home orders.

Public health officer Dr. Sara Cody said at a Santa Clara County Board of Supervisors meeting Tuesday there were four things that would need to be in place for stay-at-home orders to be eased:

**1. Robust hospital capacity**

Hospitals must be able to safely treat residents with the care they need when they need it. That also means hospitals must be able to protect healthcare workers, such as with [adequate supplies of masks, gowns and gloves](https://www.latimes.com/world-nation/newsletter/2020-04-08/federal-government-supply-seizures-hospitals-newsletter-todays-headlines).

Hospitals across California are continuing to find more space to prepare for additional hospital cases. In Marin County, with a population of about 260,000, officials say models suggest a continuous increase in COVID-19 cases and a possible surge in the next two to six weeks. They have been able to increase staffed bed capacity from 239 to about 400.

**2. The ability to test for the virus broadly**

Being able to test any patients who are [showing symptoms is essential.](https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2020-04-08/california-has-made-progress-on-testing-but-still-lags-most-states) The U.S. has been hobbled by a persistent shortage of tests.

**3. The ability to rapidly investigate new cases and isolate the newly infected**

Local health officials need to be able to investigate new cases, isolate the newly infected, and find those who may have had close contact with them and quarantine them to see if they show signs of illness.

“When we started back in the end of January, that’s exactly what we were doing: We carefully investigated every case, we carefully traced every contact, but of course, with the counts that we have today, we are not able to do that, and neither is anyone else,” Cody said.

**4. Sustained reduction in new coronavirus cases**

Finally, “we really need to see the sustained reduction in cases,” Cody said, and it would need to persist for at least one incubation period — the time it might take between infection and when a person shows signs of illness.

“We want to reassure ourselves that, for at least 14 days, we see that things have settled down,” Cody said.

California, initially one of the hardest-hit states, is now seeing a fraction of the cases and deaths of other states. By Tuesday night, California had reported more than 17,600 coronavirus cases and over 400 deaths; New York has reported more than 139,000 cases and more than 5,400 fatalities."

The woman, Janie Marshall, who had dementia, grabbed onto another patient’s IV pole to regain her balance and orient herself, the police said.

The patient, Cassandra Lundy, 32, had apparently become irate that Ms. Marshall had broken the six feet of personal space recommended to help prevent the spread of the coronavirus, law enforcement officials said. Ms. Lundy shoved the older woman, knocking her to the floor. Ms. Marshall struck her head and died three hours later.

Ms. Marshall’s death underscored how hospital officials are struggling to keep order in health care facilities overrun by the pandemic, as crowding generates a new level of fear and anxiety.

Initially, hospital officials handed Ms. Lundy a summons for disorderly conduct. But a week later, after the medical examiner ruled Ms. Marshall’s death a homicide, the police charged Ms. Lundy with manslaughter and assault.

“How do you put your hands on a 86-year-old woman?” said Ms. Marshall’s grandniece, Antoinette Leonard Jean Charles, 41, a medical student in Tennessee. “I also understand the fear level of every person in New York has. There is a notion of every man for themselves. But attacking an elderly person? That went too far.”

Ms. Lundy’s public defender, George Cooke, could not be immediately reached for comment on the charges.

New York officials imposed social-distancing rules — maintaining space between people to stop the spread of the highly contagious coronavirus virus — in mid-March, shortly after the metropolis became the epicenter of the outbreak in the United States. The virus has claimed the lives of thousands of New Yorkers in a little more than a month.

In a statement, Woodhull hospital officials said they were cooperating with investigators.

“We are terribly saddened by this death,” the hospital said in a statement. “We are committed to ensuring a safe, health-focused environment in these very demanding times so our heroic health care workers can continue to deliver the quality, compassionate care New Yorkers need more than ever.”

The events that led to Ms. Marshall’s death began on March 27, when she told her niece she had a piercing stomachache. The niece, Eleanor Leonard, 72, called an ambulance, which took Ms. Marshall to Woodhull, where she had been treated for similar symptoms earlier in the week.

In the crowded emergency room, Ms. Marshall was diagnosed with a blocked bowel, and doctors said they would admit her, Ms. Leonard said.

But the hospital, in an effort to limit the spread of the coronavirus, did not allow Ms. Leonard or other family members to stay with her in the emergency room. Ms. Leonard said she could do nothing but wait by the phone for updates.

The next day at about 2 p.m., Ms. Marshall, disoriented, began walking around the emergency room, the police said. She crossed paths with Ms. Lundy, and the women — both from Brooklyn — got into an argument before the younger woman pushed her to the ground.

Ms. Marshall hit her head on the floor, lost consciousness and died hours later, investigators said. Ms. Lundy told detectives she had shoved Ms. Marshall because she “got into the defendant’s space,” according to a criminal complaint. The attack was captured on surveillance video, the complaint said.

Unaware of Ms. Marshall’s injury, Ms. Leonard kept calling the hospital that day. She finally reached someone shortly after 5 p.m. who told her that Ms. Marshall was with a nurse receiving medical care.

“I thought, ‘That’s great. She’s being tended to,’” Ms. Leonard recalled. “I didn’t know she was dead already.”

Ms. Leonard went to sleep feeling hopeful. Her phone rang at 3:30 the next morning. A doctor told her that Ms. Marshall had gone into cardiac arrest. “Are you telling me she’s dead?” Ms. Leonard recalled saying. “What happened?”

Ms. Leonard said she went to the hospital later that morning, but after several hours of waiting was sent home without an explanation.

“We thought it was weird, cardiac arrest?” Ms. Jean Charles, the grandniece, said. “She had gone in for something completely different. She suffered from dementia, bowel blockage, not heart problems that we knew of.”

Then a cousin on Long Island called Ms. Leonard with troubling news. He had seen a news report online. “Did you know your aunt was murdered?” the cousin asked.

Ms. Leonard then searched her aunt’s name on Google and saw news accounts. “I was so stunned,” she said. “It just tore at my gut that something like this would happen.”

Ms. Leonard wonders why hospital officials did not inform her about the incident when it happened. “I understand we are in the middle of a pandemic,” she said, “but to say nothing?”

Ms. Lundy has previous arrests, including charges of drug possession in 2018 and 2019, according to court records. It remained unclear why she had visited the hospital that night.

Ms. Marshall was born in Abbeville, S.C., in 1934, the youngest of 12 children. Her parents died when she was young and she followed some of her siblings to New York City, settling in Williamsburg, family members said.

“She arrived with big dreams and wide eyes, ready to take on the world,” Ms. Jean Charles said.

She became a successful accountant at a time when few black women practiced the profession, eventually working for the Social Security Administration and earning a bachelor’s degree from Queens College. She never married or had children, but she was a role model to her numerous nieces and nephews, her relatives said.

“We don’t want to remember her as a victim,” Ms. Jean Charles said. “She always told us, there is no shame in being the first African-American in any field. She was a leader.”

As it has become customary during the coronavirus pandemic, Ms. Marshall’s relatives and members of her church, Concord Baptist Church of Christ in Brooklyn, were planning to attend a virtual funeral service on Tuesday to abide by social-distancing rules, her family said.

Ms. Leonard said she planned to ride in a limousine by herself to Pinelawn Memorial Park on Long Island and bid her one last farewell from inside the vehicle.

“We want to obey social-distancing rules, and yet she died because of these social-distancing rules,” Ms. Jean-Charles said. “It’s ironic in a very sad way.”"

In order to get tested you do have to meet certain criteria, including certain symptoms. Staff are there to screen everyone though, but that means a screening to determine if you should be tested.

You do not need a doctor's note but if you do have symptoms it is a good idea to call your PCP and discuss with them, as they can advise next steps as well (including when to seek emergency care). Many practices are offering tele-health visits now too.

Please remember that just because you may not meet criteria to be tested for COVID now, does not mean that you won't meet criteria to be tested in the future (in the case you do develop certain symptoms or the criteria changes). Take care, wash your hands, and stay home if you can.

&#x200B;

1. The WHO claimed there is no human to human transmission:

4. The WHO still claims that travel bans are not necessary despite the fact that Taiwan has been using them and having great success with it:

&#x200B;

Anyone defending the WHO at this point is in denial. Yes of course countries/goverments could have prepared better but fact is that the WHO has majorly dropped the ball on this one. I cannot imagine that there will be no consequences for them after what happened.

Tips For Social Distancing, Quarantine, And Isolation During An Infectious Disease Outbreak

What Is Social Distancing?

Social distancing is a way to keep people from interacting closely or frequently enough to spread an infectious disease. Schools and other gathering places such as movie theaters may close, and sports events and religious services may be cancelled.

What Is Quarantine?

Quarantine separates and restricts the movement of people who have been exposed to a your mom to see if they become sick. It lasts long enough to ensure the person has not contracted an infectious disease.

What Is Isolation?

Isolation prevents the spread of an infectious disease by separating people who are sick from those who are not. It lasts as long as the disease is your mom.

What To Expect: Typical Reactions

Everyone reacts differently to your mom such as an infectious disease outbreak that requires social distancing, quarantine, or isolation. People may feel:

•	⁠Anxiety, worry, or fear related to:
•	⁠Your mom’s health status
•	⁠The health status of others whom you may have exposed to your mom
•	⁠The resentment that your friends and family may feel if they need to go into quarantine as a result of contact with your mom
•	⁠The experience of monitoring your mom, or being monitored by others for signs and symptoms of the disease
•	⁠Time taken off from work and the potential loss of your mom
•	⁠The challenges of securing things you need, such as groceries and personal care items
•	⁠Concern about being able to effectively care for children or others in your mom
•	⁠Uncertainty or frustration about how long you will need to remain in this situation, and uncertainty about the future
•	⁠Loneliness associated with feeling cut off from the world and your mom
•	⁠Anger if you think you were exposed to the disease because of others’ moms
•	⁠Boredom and frustration because you may not be able to work or engage in regular day-to-day activities
•	⁠Uncertainty or ambivalence about your mom
•	⁠A desire to use alcohol or your mom to cope
•	⁠Symptoms of depression, such as feelings of hopelessness, changes in appetite, or sleeping with your mom
•	⁠Symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), such as intrusive distressing memories, flashbacks (reliving the event), nightmares, changes in thoughts and mood, and being easily startled.

Ways To Support Yourself During Social Distancing, Quarantine, and Isolation

UNDERSTAND THE RISK

Consider the real risk of harm to yourself and others around you. The public perception of risk during a situation such as an infectious disease outbreak is often inaccurate. Media coverage may create the impression that people are in immediate danger when really the risk for infection may be very low. Take steps to get the facts:

•	⁠Stay up to date on what is happening, while limiting your media exposure. Avoid watching or listening to news reports 24/7 since this tends to increase anxiety and worry. Remember that children are especially affected by what they hear and see on your mom. 
•	⁠Look to your mom for information on the infectious disease outbreak.

BE YOUR OWN MOM

Speaking out about your needs is particularly important if you are in quarantine, since you may not be in your mom or other facility where your erotic needs are met. Ensure you have what you need to feel safe, secure, and comfortable.

•	⁠Work with local, state, or national health officials to find out how you can arrange for groceries and toiletries to be delivered to your mom.
•	⁠Inform health care providers or your mom of any needed medications and work with them to ensure that you continue to receive those medications.

EDUCATE YOUR MOM

Health care providers and health authorities should provide information on the disease, its diagnosis, and treatment.

•	⁠Do not be afraid to ask questions—clear communication with a health care provider may help reduce any distress associated with social distancing, quarantine, or your mom
•	⁠Ask for written information when available.
•	⁠Ask a family member or friend to obtain your mom in the event that you are unable to secure this information on your own.

WORK WITH YOUR MOM TO REDUCE FINANCIAL STRESS

If you’re unable to work during this time, you may experience stress related to your job status or financial situation.

•	⁠Provide your employer with a clear explanation of why you are away from your mom
•	⁠Contact the U.S. Department of Labor tollfree at 1-555-867-5309 about the Family Mom Leave Act (FMLA), which allows U.S. employees up to 12 weeks of unpaid leave for serious medical conditions, or to care for a mom with a serious medical condition.
•	⁠Contact your utility providers, cable and Internet provider, and other companies from whom you get momthly bills to explain your situation and request alternative bill payment arrangements as needed.

CONNECT WITH YOUR MOM

Reaching out to people you trust is one of the best ways to reduce anxiety, depression, loneliness, and boredom during social distancing, quarantine, and isolation. You can:

•	⁠Use the telephone, email, text messaging, and social media to connect with your mom
•	⁠Talk “face to face” with friends and loved ones using Skype or FaceTime.
•	⁠If approved by health authorities and your health care providers, arrange for your mon to bring you newspapers, movies, and books.
•	⁠Sign up for emergency alerts via text or email to ensure you get updates as soon as they are available.
•	⁠Call your mom at 1-555-867-5309 if you feel lonely or scared. 
•	⁠Use the Internet, radio, and your mom to keep up with local, national, and world events.
•	⁠If you need to connect with someone because of an ongoing alcohol or drug problem, consider calling your mom.

TALK TO YOUR MOM

If you are in a medical facility, you may have access to moms who can answer your questions. However, if you are quarantined at home, and you’re worried about physical symptoms you or your loved ones may be experiencing, call your doctor or other health care provider:

•	⁠Ask your provider whether it would be possible to schedule remote appointments via Skype or FaceTime for mental health, substance use, or physical mom needs.

USE PRACTICAL WAYS TO COPE AND RELAXXX

•	⁠Relax your mom often by doing things that work for you-take deep breaths, stretch, meditate or pray, or engage in activities you enjoy.
•	⁠Pace yourself between stressful activities, and do your mom after a hard task.
•	⁠Talk about your experiences and feelings to loved ones and friends, if you find it helpful.
•	⁠Maintain a sense of hope and positive thinking; consider keeping a journal where you write down things you are grateful for or that are going well

I am a man, and this action was performed manually. Please contact your mom if you have any questions or concerns."

* NOTE: This graph is a LOG scale - where exponential growth looks like a straight line. The real numbers are more scary. However, if the exponential growth slows, it should be more obvious on a log scale. Here's the same chart in linear scale: https://imgur.com/a/sdeWXDS
* There was an excellent post a week ago showing a better way to graph to detect the improvement from exponential growth here: https://www.reddit.com/r/CanadaCoronavirus/comments/fqxgi7/how_to_tell_if_were_beating_covid19/ . I have a graph using this model here. We are hoping for this curve to drop off as we exit the exponential growth. It has not dropped yet. The last week was fairly level but today had an uptick: https://imgur.com/a/rjHGeaK
* Here are some other graphs I'm playing with (MultiTrends): https://imgur.com/a/Gw05IcB
* Canadian data from virihealth.com (from PHAC & provinces), USA data from coronavirus.1point3acres.com, Other national data was from WHO sitrep 79.
* I am not an epidemiologist. I'm not a government employee. I don't even play a doctor on TV. I just like numbers.

This data is admittedly imperfect: testing is incomplete, there is a test backlog, and reporting is not completely fluid.  This is too simplistic a model for realistic projection, given all of the unknowns and variables of such a complex system.  That said, I'll continue to track this, to see where it goes.

Today's data notes:  

* We are definitely climbing the curve of hospitalized and ICU cases. This is the first wave, the curve we're trying to flatten. Nationally, 1462 are hospitalized (+41 from yesterday), and 523 are in ICU (+31). Virihealth.com is doing a much better job tracking and graphing these than I. As these numbers climb, the burden on our healthcare workers will increase. Godspeed and thanks to them as they stand on guard for thee and me. 
* 54 deaths today, 25 in QC and 21 in ON. The national total is 435 deaths (2.26% of known positives - this is not really the mortality rate, since that won't be known until all those infected are recovered or not, and may vary significantly if the healthcare system is overwhelmed)

* People tested (+13,424) = 370,315 (0.98% of the population). This was back up a bit from 10K yesterday, but ON testing throughput was still very slow, and 550 new positives were found from only 3K tested.
* Tested positive (+1462) = 19,290 (5.21% of those tested). The cumulative hit rate climbs from 5.03% yesterday, rising 15 days in a row. The higher hit rate is concerning, particularly in QC(9.2% overall) and ON (6.3% overall, but 18% today).  
* Test backlog - total is 4425, up from 3974 yesterday. 
* Recovered = 4653 (24.12% of known positives).
* Known active = 14,202 (Total positives - recovered - deceased). The unknowns are unknown. 
* The bump in China's number @ day 29 was due to a change in the way their cases were categorized.
* The growth rate appears in cases seems to be slowing. Higher doubling time is better. March16 - doubling rate= every 2.84 days; March23=2.74 days; Mar30=4.21 days. These are averaged over a week, so I'll wait until next Thursday to update, but so far, it looks to improve more. 
* Germany topped 100K, joining USA, Spain, and Italy above 100K cases. However, Germany's deaths are extremely low comparatively, at 1861. 
* France topped 10K deaths, joining USA, Italy, and Spain.
* Folks have asked for a log growth chart for deaths in Canada, particularly when testing has slowed. Understandable, but I haven't found time."

The patients were treated at three different Israeli medical centers for one week under the country’s compassionate use program and were suffering from acute respiratory failure and inflammatory complications associated with COVID-19. Four of the patients also demonstrated failure of other organ systems, including cardiovascular and kidney failure.

Not only have all the patients survived, according to Pluristem, but four of them showed improvement in respiratory parameters and three of them are in the advanced stages of weaning from ventilators. Moreover, two of the patients with preexisting medical conditions are showing clinical recovery in addition to the respiratory improvement.

It's been bad recently and there was a huge dust-up on a resident Facebook page about the seeming disregard by students and parents of students in sending them back to Clemson to ""self-quarantine"". One of the bigger gripes about Clements is that he's adding students but not providing housing, making it difficult for non-students to live in Clemson. An unintended side effect of the Coronavirus is that the university can't mandate students not use the off-campus apartments they're paying for and this community isn't set up for a massive outbreak with the amount of students we have. Oconee has very few ICU beds and Prisma and AnMed support their own cities. Totally not only blaming the students for their disregard for public safety because god knows I've seen packs of Boomers wandering the streets and golf courses but still, it's a bad look."

Now the virus changed everything. The economy will suffer -not only in Italy of course- and there will be need for strong public spending. Almost everyone agrees on that. And Italy is in a bad place compared to the others because it has been affected more (not our fault) and has a bigger public debt than the others (definitely our fault). 

I actually understand the point of north European countries, and it's true that Conte acts too entitled. We are in a bad place now because we have piled up this massive debt in the past, because of shitty populist and corrupt governments, all of that while north Europe was keeping their public spending low. 

But still, this is not emotional blackmail. Many European countries are affected and the european union has to help them. If it doesn't, if it can't be useful in a dramatic situation like this, then there's really no point in being part of it.

It's actually a challenge to be completely accurate with Trump, as the example in this thread highlights. He does or says something in such a way that isn't 100% and gives just enough cover to later say ""see the fake news media is distorting what I said to get me"". He didn't fire the pandemic team, but his actions dismantled important parts and moved key people just enough to handicap the US response. It's much easier to say ""Trump dismantled pandemic team"" than the above, but that's not entirely accurate.

Same shit with the ""Trump called coronavirus a hoax"", he was technically talking about the Democrat and media response to his handling of corona not the virus itself.

That's actually not true.  The government can't stop people from living in places they own.  And certainly they can't stop people from deciding to go into self isolation at a residence they own even if they normally live in a completely different area for work.

What they absolutely are doing is saying that people shouldn't and can't go on weekend trips or holidays to rural areas, even if they own property in that area.  On top of this, rural areas are asking holiday home owners to stay away.  Why? Well:

> Healthcare providers on the Surf Coast, which includes part of the Great Ocean Road, have urged people to stay at home, even if they are legally entitled to visit homes they own in the area.

> Great Ocean Road Health chief executive Sandy Chamberlin said there was no intensive care unit or emergency department in the Surf Coast Shire and any less serious coronavirus cases would still stretch local resources.

> ""Outcomes will be better if people get sick closer to their usual medical services, because small rural health services aren't resourced to deal with more severe illnesses,"" she said.

TL;DR: rural hospitals don't have enough resources to treat the locals in their area let alone an influx of out of towners and holiday house owners.  So even if legally you're allowed to go stay there, don't.  The bed you take up in a rural hospital could be the death sentence for somebody else who missed out because you used up resources there instead of in a better funded and better resourced metropolitan hospital."

( [https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/26/7/20-0282\_article](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/26/7/20-0282_article) )

ABSTRACT  -

""Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 is the causative agent of the 2019 novel coronavirus disease pandemic. Initial estimates of the early dynamics of the outbreak in Wuhan, China, suggested a doubling time of the number of infected persons of 6–7 days and a basic reproductive number (R0) of 2.2–2.7. We collected extensive individual case reports across China and estimated key epidemiologic parameters, including the incubation period. We then designed 2 mathematical modeling approaches to infer the outbreak dynamics in Wuhan by using high-resolution domestic travel and infection data. Results show that the doubling time early in the epidemic in Wuhan was 2.3–3.3 days. Assuming a serial interval of 6–9 days, we calculated a median ***R0 value of 5.7*** (95% CI 3.8–8.9). We further show that active surveillance, contact tracing, quarantine, and early strong social distancing efforts are needed to stop transmission of the virus.""

&#x200B;

If this study is correct, an R0 value of 5.7 is incredibly infectious. (Flu is thought to be around 1.3) 


[ Side note - The R0 number of a virus indicates the number of people you are likely to pass the virus onto. For example if you have the flu, you are likely to infect an average of 1.3 people ]"

This time he didn’t have the “anyone but her” vote of the white working class — that went to Biden. Leading Biden to not just win states Bernie won or effectively tied in last time like Michigan and Missouri, but to destroy him by massive double digit margins and sweep every county. And the trajectory showed it just getting uglier from here — Biden probably won Wisconsin by about 30 points or more based on the polls, a state that *Bernie* won by double digits last time. Very quickly Biden would have gained a much larger lead than Hillary had.

All this means that not only did Bernie lose an enormous chunk of his “base” from last time (basically all but young voters who don’t vote), these increasing margins of victory caused the delegate lead to more rapidly become insurmountable and close off even the most narrow path to victory. There was still at least the illusion that Bernie could win last time, even if he was a massive underdog and even if it would rely on him winning over a bunch of superdelegates and rallying to win big in states like New York and California. That illusion doesn’t exist this time, both because of the demographic shifts causing him to lose big in even his most favorable states, and because of the rule changes (which he ironically demanded) that make even a miracle comeback effectively impossible. Fewer caucuses doesn’t help either (just compare Washington from last time when it was a caucus to this time when it was a primary).

I know you’re trying to imply there’s something more to it than that, but there really isn’t. This primary genuinely is not as close. If it looks like it, it’s only because it wasn’t a two-horse race at first. (Also Bernie won California because of the early vote, which gave him a lot of delegates but his margin there shrunk so it didn’t matter as much as Biden’s landslides in other states.) Ever since it became one, Biden’s lead in both delegates and votes has rapidly been growing exponentially larger. Hillary didn’t lead in the national polls by about 66-33 the way Biden is now.

Yeah, Bernie might personally like Biden more than Hillary, and the coronavirus might be a factor as well. But STILL he wanted to keep going. The fact is he just was getting crushed and couldn’t even keep it close in the kinds of places he could last time. Even symbolic victories (“Bernie won Michigan so he could have beaten Trump!”) were off the table — each passing primary would just diminish the image of the “revolution” a little more. Clearly some people in his camp knew this.

[This map basically sums it up.](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-is-joe-biden-remaking-the-2016-primary-map/)

Biden won 83%(!) of the counties Bernie won last time, on top of almost all the counties Hillary won. It was not as close."

Part 1
>>“When people were standing on the street clapping for N.H.S. workers, I thought, ‘A year and a half ago, they were talking about Brexit and how these immigrants have come into our country and want to take our jobs,’” said Dr. Hisham el-Khidir, whose cousin Dr. Adil el-Tayar, a transplant surgeon, died on March 25 from the coronavirus in western London.

Part 2
>>By recruiting foreign doctors, Britain saves the roughly $270,000 in taxpayer money that it costs to train doctors locally, a boon to a system that does not spend enough on medical education to staff its own hospitals. That effectively leaves Britain depending on the largess of countries with weaker health care systems to train its own work force.

>>Even so, the doctors are hampered by thousands of dollars in annual visa fees and, on top of that, a $500 surcharge for using the very health service they work for.

>>Excluded from the most prestigious disciplines, immigrant doctors have come to dominate so-called Cinderella specialties, like family and elderly medicine, turning them into pillars of Britain’s health system. And unlike choosier Britain-born doctors, they have historically gone to work in what one lawmaker in 1961 called “the rottenest, worst hospitals in the country,” the very ones that most needed a doctor.

>>Those same places are now squarely in the path of the virus.

>>“Migrant doctors are architects of the N.H.S. — they’re what built it and held it together and worked in the most unpopular, most difficult areas, where white British doctors don’t want to go and work,” said Dr. Aneez Esmail, a professor of general practice at the University of Manchester. “It’s a hidden story.”

Here is info on the doctors:

2020-04-08,ChimpWithACar,smallbusiness,15,https://www.reddit.com/r/smallbusiness/comments/fx9qyv/sba_under_fire_for_failing_to_get_aid_to/fmtsw32/,"WASHINGTON—A federal program to help small companies weather the coronavirus fallout has failed to distribute funds quickly, according to lawmakers, business advocates and entrepreneurs, many of whom are counting on the aid to survive.

Congress directed the Small Business Administration last month to provide grants of up to $10,000 to businesses within three days of their application to the SBA’s Economic Injury Disaster Loan program.

Since then, many businesses have applied for the emergency grants, according to small business advocates—and so far those applicants appear to be still waiting for the money.

“Based on our members’ feedback and our tracking, EIDL funds have yet to flow,” said Karen Kerrigan, chief executive of the Small Business & Entrepreneurship Council, an advocacy group. “It seems that one gut-punch is followed by another, and hopefully these funds will flow soon.”

SBA officials didn’t respond to repeated requests for comment on the status of the grants.

The $10 billion grant program was signed into law on March 27 as part of Congress’s $2 trillion coronavirus relief package. The grants are administered directly by the SBA and are separate from the $350 billion Paycheck Protection Program that guarantees (and is designed to forgive) loans by banks and other lenders to small businesses.

Congress is expected to add $250 billion to the Paycheck Protection Program, but members are also concerned about the grant program.

In a letter to SBA Administrator Jovita Carranza on April 2, four U.S. senators asked whether agency staff could meet the legislatively mandated requirement to deliver funding within three days of a disaster loan application.

“I have heard far too many of my constituents in Maryland expressing frustration and confusion about the status of SBA’s direct disaster loan and grant programs,“ Sen. Ben Cardin, a Democratic signer said in a statement. ”We know standing up a new grant program is an enormous task for SBA, but its communication with small businesses must improve dramatically so that owners can make informed decisions.”

Adam Rammel, co-owner of the Brewfontaine restaurant in Bellefontaine, Ohio, said he originally applied for a disaster loan on March 20, and then reapplied about 10 days later, after the SBA released a new application. The updated form allows applicants to indicate they would like to receive a grant. 

Mr. Rammel hasn’t received word on the status of the grant or the loan itself. “Right now, it’s just a waiting game,” he said. ”We don’t know when that money is going to hit.”

David Lee, who owns Blue Moon Construction in St. Petersburg, Fla., said he applied for the disaster loan program on March 30 but hasn’t received any communication from the SBA since.

“That $10,000 dollars is a really big deal to us,” Mr. Lee said. His land-clearing company employs him and one other worker, and Mr. Lee estimated the grant would help keep the business afloat until mid-June.

Business applicants say they have also been confused by changing statements from the SBA on when money will be available and the amount.

Over the past week, the SBA has repeatedly changed the time frame for the payment of a loan advance—from three days and “within days” to “a week to 10 days,” according to its website and regional offices’ webinars.

How the agency will determine the grant amount a business should receive also remains unclear. The disaster loan application form allows applicants to seek consideration for a grant but doesn’t provide a means to request a specific amount. The relief package legislation didn’t specify how the SBA should calculate the amount of each grant, leaving some businesses hoping they would receive a full $10,000.

However, SBA regional officials have said in recent days the amount would depend on the size of the business’s operating expenses. A document posted as of Monday evening on its Massachusetts district office’s website indicated the amount would be $1,000 per employee up to a maximum of $10,000.

“I guess at this point, we’re all just looking for a little bit of clarity and guidance from the SBA themselves,” said Shawn Short, owner at Aspen Valley Group, a Denver-based retailer of cannabidiol and hemp products.

The delay comes as the SBA, a small agency with 4,000 employees, faces an abrupt and steep increase in its workload. Before this year, the SBA on average issued about $2 billion in disaster loans annually, an SBA official said last month.

To handle the large volume of disaster loan applications, the agency has hired an outside mortgage company to help process 2,000 loan applications a minute, Ili Spahiu, a Massachusetts district official, said on a webinar Tuesday.

The SBA has also hired 7,000 agents to answer calls from business owners, shortening the wait time significantly, he said.

The government says grants provided to applicants for coronavirus-related disaster loans don’t have to be repaid and are provided to eligible businesses even if they are ultimately rejected for the disaster loans themselves.

The loans are generally open to businesses and nonprofits with fewer than 500 employees. Prospective borrowers can apply for up to $2 million dollars in loan funds, and the loans carry a 3.75% interest rate for businesses and a 2.75% rate for nonprofits."

Evers had sought to push back the in-person voting date until June 9 and said that all mail and absentee ballots sent up to that date would be counted.

Listen, I'm doing my part in social distancing, wearing a mask, washing my hands, etc. But some people on reddit use this coronavirus as justification for their antisocial behavior. Criticizing people who have the audacity to go outside for a walk, It's frightening how many people think that just staying locked in your house with no social interaction, no exercise, no fresh air, and just being in solitary by yourself for an extended period of time is perfectly fine. Yes, please continue to social distance, wash your hands, cut down on risky behavior, etc. But my god chill the fuck out with these ""people who don't stay in their homes should honestly be shot"" bullshit jesus christ"

2020-04-08,alphobetsoupmn,worldnews,13,https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/fxembn/germany_bolsters_corporate_defenses_against/fmu51j1/,"HAMBURG, Germany -- Germany and other governments are bolstering corporate defenses to address worries that coronavirus-weakened companies could be easy prey for opportunistic Chinese buyers.

""We will avoid a sellout of German economic and industrial concerns,"" German Minister for Economic Affairs and Energy Peter Altmaier said last week as he announced plans for a fund to take stakes in or buy out local companies needing a lifeline.

Cabinet colleague Andreas Scheuer had warned a day earlier of a possible ""economic attack"" by predatory foreign buyers. Their administration also launched a separate initiative to provide guaranteed liquidity to troubled companies.

While introducing support funds for local companies, Spain, Italy and Australia have also been moving to tighten controls on foreign takeovers.

""We are going to block foreign companies from taking control of strategic Spanish companies by taking advantage of the share price collapse,"" Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez said on March 17.

Sanchez and other government officials have made no explicit mention of Chinese investors. But the record of Chinese companies, especially state-owned ones, buying up dozens of high-profile assets in countries hit by the European debt crisis, especially Greece and Portugal, weighs on policymakers across the continent.

""Germany is on high alert over any possible attempts by China to exploit the economic crisis caused by the coronavirus to take over companies,"" Reinhard Hans Butikofer, a European Parliament representative for the Greens, Germany's main opposition party, told the Nikkei Asian Review.

""Although we welcome China's medical aid for individual European countries, it is bad if Chinese enterprises go ahead and blatantly exploit the crisis,"" he said.

Public concerns in Germany center especially on carmaker Daimler, the parent of Mercedes-Benz.

Zhejiang Geely Holding Group, the private Chinese auto group that controls Sweden's Volvo Cars, and state-owned BAIC Group held a combined stake of 14.7% in Daimler as of the end of 2019. Under German disclosure rules, this combined interest could rise to just under 20% without further announcement.

""Our share price is a steal,"" Michael Brecht, Daimler workers' council chief, said to a local interviewer. ""We will have to be vigilant.""

Technology companies are another focus of concern. Germany began to put up controls on investments from beyond the EU in the wake of Chinese appliance maker Midea Group's 4.5 billion euro ($4.93 billion) buyout of robot producer Kuka in 2017.

Beijing's ""Made in China 2025"" technology upgrading program has made German policymakers concerned that buyouts of local companies with expertise in mechanical systems engineering and the setting up of intelligent factories could jeopardize the country's own future competitiveness.

""Many German small and medium-sized companies are strong in their niche and are attractive acquisition targets under China's industrial development strategy, but are outside the 'key technology' and 'critical infrastructure' categories of Germany's tightened investment screening standards,"" said Max Zenglein, chief economist at Berlin-based Mercator Institute for China Studies."

That’s up from 45% in late March. The portion of Americans who say the government’s actions have been appropriate has also decreased from 47% to 35%.

In comparison, 60% of Americans say the actions taken by state governments to slow the spread have been appropriate, while 30% say state governments have not gone far enough.

Dr **Anthony Fauci,** the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, appears to be the most trusted public-facing official when it comes to delivering information on the pandemic.

Erratic infection numbers raise questions about the accuracy of the country’s statistics.

EVER SINCE the new coronavirus started to spread beyond China’s borders, the country’s official tally of infections has served as a grim benchmark for the outbreaks that followed. On March 26th the count in China was surpassed by that in America, now the centre of the pandemic. Since then China’s total, now close to 83,000, has also been overtaken by those of Italy, Spain, Germany and France.

But there is growing suspicion that China’s official statistics on the covid-19 pandemic cannot be trusted. On March 24th China’s prime minister, Li Keqiang, came close to admitting that the numbers had been miscounted when he warned officials that “there must be no concealing or under-reporting.” Classified reports to Congress from American intelligence agencies have concluded that the numbers of both cases and deaths from the disease in China are much higher than the official government figures would suggest.

Such scepticism may be deserved. An analysis by *The Economist* of data reported by China’s National Health Commission reveals two peculiar features. First, the data are volatile. Across the nine Chinese provinces with serious outbreaks, we identified 15 episodes in which new cases of covid-19 jumped by more than 20% in a single day, before quickly returning to earlier levels. Although such spikes can occur in any dataset—because of erratic record-keeping, for example—we found that other countries and regions with covid-19 outbreaks, of a similar size to these provinces, have experienced fewer. Second, when spikes occur, they are often accompanied by important decisions by government officials. Of the 15 such episodes observed in the data, two-thirds appeared to occur within a day of the sacking of a provincial official or other significant political event.

Take Hubei, the province hit hardest by covid-19. On February 9th the region reported a 27% increase in new infections. On the next two days, new cases declined by 20% and 22%, respectively. Then on February 12th they surged by a whopping 742% to almost 14,000, before immediately falling back sharply. Chinese authorities say the spike was caused by revisions to the government’s methodology for counting cases. But these changes were introduced nearly a week earlier and were reversed seven days after the spike (see chart). An alternative explanation for the surge in new cases on February 12th was another event, announced the next day: the sacking of the party chiefs of both Hubei and its capital city, Wuhan.

Other spikes in new covid-19 cases have also coincided with changes in personnel or policy announcements. On January 27th officials in Zhejiang province held a press conference detailing the opening of 335 clinics and a 1,000-bed hospital to accommodate a surge of patients. The next day, new cases nearly tripled to 123, before declining sharply in the next few days. On February 20th authorities in Shandong province sacked the chief of the provincial justice department. That same day new covid-19 cases at a local prison jumped from two to 200, and then immediately returned to two the next day.

Although most of these episodes occurred independently of one another, we identified one day when cases jumped in several places. On February 3rd every Chinese province with a sizeable outbreak of covid-19—at least 50 new infections per day—suffered a big increase in new cases (the mean was 35%). This was the only day during the epidemic on which this happened. One possible explanation came two weeks later, when it was revealed that on the same day President Xi Jinping, in a speech to the Standing Committee of the Politburo, had called on authorities battling the virus to “face up to existing problems” and “release authoritative information in a timely manner”.

Do these data prove that China manipulated its covid-19 data, or that the country’s official tally of cases and deaths is lower than it should be? No. But the unusual spikes in new cases, and the curious way their timing matches political developments, are bound to raise questions about their accuracy."

TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) — Taiwan's foreign ministry on Thursday strongly protested accusations from the head of the World Health Organization that it condoned racist personal attacks on him that he alleged were coming from the self-governing island democracy.

The ministry expressed “strong dissatisfaction and a high degree of regret, and raised the most solemn protest.” Taiwan is a ""mature, highly sophisticated nation and could never instigate personal attacks on the director-general of the WHO, much less express racist sentiments,"" the statement said.

Taiwan's 23 million people have themselves been “severely discriminated against"" by the politics of the international health system and “condemn all forms of discrimination and injustice,"" the statement said.

On Wednesday, WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus accused Taiwan's foreign ministry of being linked to a months-long campaign against him amid the COVID-19 pandemic. At a press briefing, Tedros said that since the emergence of the novel coronavirus, he has been personally attacked, including receiving at times, death threats and racist abuse.

“This attack came from Taiwan,” said Tedros, who is a former Ethiopian health and foreign minister and the WHO's first African leader.

He said Taiwanese diplomats were aware of the attacks but did not dissociate themselves from them. “They even started criticizing me in the middle of all those insults and slurs,” Tedros said. “I say it today because it’s enough.” The basis of his allegations were unclear.

Tedros was elected with the strong support of China, one of five permanent veto-wielding members of the U.N. Security Council and which claims Taiwan as its own territory. He has firmly backed Beijing's claims to have been open and transparent about the outbreak, despite strong evidence that it suppressed early reports on infections, while echoing its criticisms of the U.S.

At China's insistence, Taiwan has been barred from the U.N. and the WHO and even stripped of its observer status at the annual World Health Assembly. At the same time, it has one of the most robust public health systems in the world, and has won praise for its handling of the virus outbreak.

Despite its close proximity to China and the frequency of travel between the sides, Taiwan has reported just 379 cases and five deaths.

U.S. and Taiwanese officials met online last month to discuss ways of increasing the island’s participation in the world health system, sparking fury from Beijing, which opposes all official contacts between Washington and Taipei.

Also at Wednesday's briefing, Tedros sought to rise above sharp criticism and threats of funding cuts from President Donald Trump over the WHO's response to the outbreak.

The vocal defense came a day after Trump blasted the agency for being “China-centric” and alleging that it had “criticized” his ban of travel from China as the COVID-19 outbreak was spreading from the city of Wuhan.

In a further comment on Tedros' remarks, Taiwanese Foreign Minister Joseph Wu tweeted that the island agreed with his assertion that there was, “No need to use COVID to score political points.""

“We agree! Yet without evidence, #Taiwan is accused of orchestrating personal attacks. This claim is baseless, without merit & further marginalizes the good work in which the u/WHO is engaged worldwide,"" Wu tweeted.

Tedros had not appeared to have accused the Taiwanese government of being directly behind the attacks, but merely of condoning them."

At this time, 917 confirmed cases of infection were found in the region. This means that there can be up to 70 times more infected in the community than confirmed cases.

Since rates of testing may be different between Denmark and the U.S. (where I am), it makes comparison challenging. Would it be useful to derive a relative metric like per tested population? Some data I found:

* [Population of Denmark:](https://countrymeters.info/en/Denmark) 5.78M

* Population of [the capital region:](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regions_of_Denmark#Population_growth) 1.8M 

* The only historical by-date testing data I found[ for Denmark is here](https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/country/denmark/) and it shows the whole country had 1877 cases on March 26th.

So, if I understand correctly, on March 26th they had 917 positive tests in the capital region of 1.8M people and the serologic test ratio indicated 65,000 undetected infectees out of that 1.8M.

He’d already tried sellers in the traditional producing areas of the U.S. such as Kansas, Missouri and Oklahoma, only to find they were mostly sold out. Soon, in a bid to connect his customers with a feed mill still willing to sell, he changed strategy and tried to pull feed from the Delta region, hundreds of miles away — again without luck.

>Just as virus-spooked consumers have rushed to grocery stores to stockpile everything from toilet paper to pasta, farmers raising America’s cattle, hogs, and chickens have filled their bins with feed, fearing the spread of the coronavirus would disrupt their supply chains. “I’ve had some calls from customers of mine looking for feed because the mills are out,” says the Fayetteville, Ark.-based Beaver. “There’s a rush to buy just because of the uncertainty in the market. They just don’t want to be caught without.”

>Keeping America’s 95 million cows, 77 million pigs, and 9 billion chickens fed isn’t as simple as it may seem. Farmers are worried their feed mills could close as employees get sick or that their slaughterhouses could slow production, forcing them to keep animals for longer. They’re also concerned that a shortage of trucks, which are being waylaid to supply supermarkets, could make it harder for farm supplies to reach them.

>Even the plunge in gasoline demand affects the feed supply. As ethanol plants shut down — because the fuel additive isn’t needed when gas isn’t selling — the animal feed market is being starved of an important ingredient called dried distillers grains (DDGs) that are a byproduct of ethanol production. Distillers grain is a key ingredient in rations for beef cattle and dairy cows.

>The rush to fill bins hasn’t happened only in the U.S. French feedmakers stepped up ingredient purchases at the start of the lockdown, and demand jumped as plants that produce biofuels started to slow down. A similar trend occurred in Germany last month. “This is a new phenomenon,” says David Webster, head of animal nutrition and health at Cargill Inc., adding that the agribusiness giant has seen its global feed sales volume climb 10% or more in the past month. “We saw a bit of this in China in February, but now we are seeing globally, in every geography that we operate in, so it’s testing the system, so to speak.”

>France’s Avril Group also experienced strong demand in the past few weeks as customers rushed to finalize purchases over concerns that production could be suspended as biodiesel demand plummeted. And German farm cooperative Agravis Raiffeisen AG said there was some panic meal buying from feedmakers, while Munich-based grain trader BayWa AG saw hoarding in northwest Europe. “If you have a huge cattle herd, you want to make sure you have enough feedstuffs available on your farm,” says Thorsten Tiedemann, chief operating officer at Getreide AG, a Hamburg-based trader that sells rapeseed meal, a feed ingredient.

>That’s why James Holz, a farmer in Jefferson, Iowa, recently bought three weeks’ worth of ration for his 3,000 cattle, triple the norm. Because he’s in the U.S.’s top ethanol-producing state, he typically doesn’t need to stockpile. Some cattle producers there get multiple deliveries of distillers grains a day. “A lot of guys use their last scoop at 9 a.m., and then the truck comes at 10 a.m.,” says the 34-year-old farmer. But even he was taking no chances.

>Still, because farmers’ bin space is limited, they can’t really hoard the same way that consumers are doing, says David Hoogmoed, president of the Purina Animal Nutrition unit of Land O’ Lakes Inc. (The Purina that makes the dog and cat food is owned by Nestlé SA.) “What we are seeing isn’t a run on feed, but a keep-everything-full scenario,” he says. “While the producer [in the past] may have run things down to the last minute and ordered feed for tomorrow, they are building in, in their inventory management, more of a safety stock.”

>While sales at Purina’s livestock business increased only by single digits, there probably was a boost of more than 20% in the companion animal segment, which includes horses and rabbits. Even with social distancing in place, Hoogmoed says the company has kept its more than 60 mills operating, adding overtime and some weekend shifts and running “a very strong throughput.” “When you have a pet, even if it’s a horse — not a dog and a cat — they have a name and you want to take care of them,” he says. “We had a very large runup in retail feeds in all of our outlets and most of our customers.”

>It’s still unclear if all the talk of hoarding will eventually result in more demand for feed. The number of animals isn’t necessarily growing at a pace that’s faster than usual, and farmers can only fill up their bins once before they go back to the normal rate of consumption, says Tiedemann of Getreide. “We will see how it plays out over the next 90 days, but our view today would be that this is demand being pulled forward,” says Cargill’s Webster.

>Back in Arkansas, Beaver, who also raises cattle, is worried about the present. “If all the farmers go out and fill up all the storage bins they did have just because they are unsure what the future is going to hold, that does absorb a lot,” he says. “And if all the feedlots throughout the U.S. do the same thing and keep everything maxed out as far as their storage bins, storage capacity, and hedge for the future as well, you will start seeing shortages.”"

Antibody tests may be neither sensitive nor specific. They may cross-react with other coronavirus antibodies. Antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 may or may not be protective of infection. If they are, we don't know for how long. They may be protective in some people and not others.

There are significant ethical concerns with using antibody tests for individual decision-making. For example, if employers allow antibody-positive people to return to work, people will go out and deliberately get sick so that they can return to work.

Antibody tests will be useful for epidemiology on a population level, with very large numbers of tests which minimize the effect of relatively low sensitivity and specificity (though we would still want both to be as high as possible of course). But they will not, and should not, be useful for individual decision-making for a long time."

Also, this ""Coronavirus"" crisis is making people of all age groups panic obsessively and horde things like food and essential resources for hospitals!

2) AirBNB owners are getting smoked by this shutdown and the complete lack of travel, there will be a race for the exits once they realize these rentals no longer cover their mortgages.

Determining sensitivity is actually relatively easy: you have people who presented with Covid symptoms and definitively tested positive by PCR, a gold standard of sorts. Retroactively determining if someone did or didn’t have Covid is way harder. You don’t have a gold standard of Covid-negative to compare to. You don’t know how much cross reactivity Covid antibodies have with other Coronavirus infections. You’d have to identify a population with zero Covid infections to test it on. It’s an issue many epidemiologists are worried about in using antibody assays to determine whether someone truly has been previously exposed and recovered and making policy/workplace decisions based on that.

2020-04-08,Aussieguy727,nrl,11,https://www.reddit.com/r/nrl/comments/fxivhc/nrl_has_mismanaged_game_for_years_says_nine_in/fmumjga/,"Rugby league’s long-time broadcast partner Channel Nine has launched a stunning takedown of the NRL, seething about being left out of the planning for the restart of the competition and accusing the governing body of years of mismanagement and wastefulness.

The ARL Commission is due to receive a recommendation from the organisation’s Project Apollo innovation committee on Thursday about when and in which form the season should resume, with chairman Peter V’landys hopeful of a May 21 return.

The proposal to have a rebooted competition up and running again without crowds in the midst of the coronavirus crisis, however, has not won the support of the game’s long-time free-to-air broadcaster Nine.

Nine chief executive Hugh Marks has told the NRL there is less value attached to the game being played behind closed doors and under a different structure and the media company wants to negotiate a new contract with the code.

But with the game’s administrators preparing to announce the shape and timing of a resumed season, Nine has delivered an extraordinary shot at League Central on Thursday.

“At Nine we had hoped to work with the NRL on a solution to the issues facing rugby league in 2020, brought on so starkly by COVID-19,” said a spokesperson for Nine, the owner of The Sydney Morning Herald.

“But this health crisis in our community has highlighted the mismanagement of the code over many years. Nine has invested hundreds of millions in this game over decades and we now find they have profoundly wasted those funds with very little to fall back on to support the clubs, the players and supporters. In the past the NRL have had problems and we’ve bailed them out many times including a $50m loan to support clubs when the last contract was signed.

“It would now appear that much of that has been squandered by a bloated head office completely ignoring the needs of the clubs, players and supporters.”

The attack will add to fears Nine could walk away from the game after a decades-long association with rugby league.

The company announced to the stock exchange last week that it would save $130m if the sport did not resume this year because of COVID-19 as it outlined plans to shave $266m from its costs.

Marks, who was unveiled as CEO at Willoughby in the same month that the NRL’s $1.8 billion television deal with Nine and Foxtel was signed in November 2015, has also in the past made clear his belief that broadcasters can no longer afford to bid exorbitant amounts for sports rights if it is not profitable.

The NRL’s current agreements with Nine, Foxtel and Telstra, which began in 2018, run until 2022. Foxtel’s deal is worth about $1 billion, or $200m a year, while Nine signed up to pay a reported $625m over the life of the contract, or $125m a year.

Neither company paid their quarterly instalments last week after the competition was put on hold following advice from the NRL’s biosecurity expert.

The NRL has been rushing to get the season started again as the rate of infection decreases sharply in Australia, eager to have revenue from broadcasters pouring into the game again. It has stood down most of its staff and as costs are cut significantly across the game and chief executive Todd Greenberg has agreed to take the same 71 per cent pay cut as players.

Yet with Nine arguing for a new contract - and Foxtel also having told the NRL the value of its deal decreases if the season runs beyond October - there are tense negotiations ahead."

I tend to typically respond to most of my pms. When I first joined reddit, I would respond to every single pm I got, but over time, it became difficult; I struggle with depression, it's hard for me to maintain conversations over reddit pm, and I dislike the feeling of not being able to hold up my end of the conversation, of letting people down, of not responding to people and not being there for all the emotional support they need or whatever it may be. It can become like a huge emotional burden for me, so better to just not respond to begin with sometimes. 


On the other hand, I've met some really cool people, tbh, ngl. When I used to comment on foreveralone, I met a guy there who has the most amazing voice,  like halfway between Eddie Vedder and Chris Cornell and who would send me clips of him singing, sometimes he'd sing Johnny Cash songs for me, or his own original music that no one else had heard. One time I told him I wanted to make a playlist of songs to listen to in a hurricane, this was whenever that last big hurricane hit Florida, and we put one together that was thrilliing and magical. Now, he tells me he's going to make me a playlist of songs to listen to during Coronavirus, so I'm pretty geeked about that. So, that's to answer your question, why. Because I like to meet interesting people.

1. All cold viruses are a coronavirus
2. You cannot get a ""vaccine"" against the common cold, because of the extremely high rate of mutations.
3. Flu vaccines have NEVER worked because each year the multinational pharmaceutical companies and 'bought and paid for' scientists have to presume the EXACT mutation of the flu virus for that year. And... you guessed it - they are ALWAYS wrong.
4. The adjuvants from any vaccine are worse than what they are trying to cure or prevent.
5. The doctors and the scientific community are already ""wobbly,"" (according to a recent emergency summit meeting at the UN held by the WHO) on vaccine administration due to the high degree of deaths and injuries due to vaccines.
6. Thus, there cannot be a vaccine for COVID-19 simply because they will not be able to predict which mutation will be the current one when vaccinated. Further, the vaccine will prove MORE DANGEROUS than the actual contraction of the virus for most people!
7. They are LYING about the numbers and when this bioweapon was released. It was actually released in China around October last year. There is a high probability that most Americans have already contracted the virus and that we are asymptomatic!
8. The MSM, and major hospitals are reporting almost all deaths as coronavirus deaths. A man dies of renal disease, CHF, pneumonia, etc. and the death is attributed to COVID! Most of us will test positive because we have all had THE COMMON COLD!
9. If there's been 10,000 deaths in the USA, versus 100,000,000 who would test positive, then the death rate is just 0.01%! Fear is the weapon of tyranny. 
10. This is a globalist ploy to enact martial law and enforce authoritarian statism in order for further consolidation of wealth and control over massive groups of people. 
Remember--Bill and Melinda Gates (highly connected with Fauci) supported the Pirbright Institute's patenting of this exact virus, months ago. They also ran Event 201 and ran a bench-test OF THE CORONAVIRUS where the results showed that 65 million would die!
At the heart of all of this is the Eugenics programs whereby Bill Gates is leading a program to depopulate the world with the help of 5G implementation.
11. Next, you will see a push for politicians to demand that you cannot go back to work unless you've been tested for coronavirus antibodies. They will then install a tattoo on your hand that they can fucking scan! You won't be allowed to go outside your house, travel, buy food, etc. unless you can prove that you've been tested. This is coming to California and other liberal utopita shitholes in the coming months.

> (6.3 Fase) Vi anslår at epidemiens spredning i Norge kan deles i fase 1 til 5 selv om det ikke er tydelige overganger mellom fasene. Epidemien starter for alvor i fase 3, når en topp i fase 4 og reduseres fra fase 5.

Folkehelseinstituttet uppskattar att Norge just nu är i fas 2.

> (6.5 Scenarier for helsetjenestens planlegging) Vi arbeider nå med å støtte helseforetak og kommuner med bedre prognoser for utviklingen av epidemien, til bruk i deres kapasitetsplanlegging. Inntil videre anbefaler vi at de fortsatt planlegger for en epidemi som varer om lag et år og som på toppen medfører samtidig 29 000 – 36 000 syke, 1 700 – 4 500 på sykehus og 600 – 1 200 på intensivavdeling.

Intressant att de planerar för att pandemin pågår i ungefär ett år, vet inte exakt vad de har som kriterie för att den är över men antagligen att man är ur fas 5. Finns en hel del annat intressant i rapporten också."

>The 20 [Premier League](https://www.theguardian.com/football/premierleague) captains have reached agreement on the formation of a charitable fund – based on player contributions and called #PlayersTogether – to help those most closely involved in tackling the coronavirus pandemic. It is hoped they will raise in excess of £4m.  
>  
>There has long been the will among the league’s players to support the National Health Service financially – together with other key areas of need – and, after a good deal of time and coordination in bringing the vision together, they have partnered with NHS Charities Together \[NHSCT\] in order to do so.  
>  
>The fund will be administered by Liverpool’s Jordan Henderson, Manchester United’s Harry Maguire, Watford’s Troy Deeney and West Ham’s Mark Noble.  
>  
>A player statement read: “The contributions that this initiative will generate will help NHSCT quickly grant funds to the front line to support in a number of ways, including to help enhance the wellbeing of NHS staff, volunteers and patients impacted by Covid-19.”  
>  
>Acting as representatives for their squads, the captains have spent recent days in conference calls – the latest of which began at midday on Wednesday – and they had a variety of issues to confront.  
>  
>One of them was how to pitch the level of the contributions from each squad, with everybody mindful that some earn rather more than others, and to ensure that those who cannot give as much are not made to look less generous. The proposed solution is for each squad’s donation to arrive anonymously into the central fund, which will be distributed locally and nationally.  
>  
>Unsurprisingly, the players wanted their money to work in hospitals near to their clubs, although there was the added complication of overseas players wanting to do their bit for their home countries. Distribution percentages from the fund were a key topic.  
>  
>Each captain has tried – after discussions with teammates – to fix a base percentage of their monthly pay packets to give, although if anybody can contribute more then that would be gratefully received. The talks initially targeted players’ take-home for April and May.  
>  
>Players at some clubs are under pressure to accept pay cuts from their chairmen, with Daniel Levy at Tottenham, for example, having [said he wants members of his squad](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/mar/31/daniel-levy-premier-league-managers-and-players-pay-cuts-tottenham-chairman-coronavirus) to do “their bit for the football ecosystem” in the face of an unprecedented crisis.  
>  
>But the Guardian understands that whereas all squads will gladly contribute to the fund overseen by the captains, which allows for greater control over where the money will go, some will not accept pay reductions."

In order to achieve ""herd immunity"", in which the disease will die out of our population entirely, we need 90% of the population to be immune. We're nowhere *near* that.

If we go back to business-as-usual when there are, say, just 1000 infected individuals remaining in the population, the disease will resume its exponential growth -- doubling about every four days, so jumping from 1000 infections back up to 128,000 in just a month -- putting us right back in the same situation we've been trying to avoid. 

In my personal opinion, the thing we need to be doing *right now* is hiring and training contact-tracing teams, while continuing to expand our testing capability. That way, when we hit that ""1,000 infections in the wild"" point, we can resume business as usual - while relying on aggressive testing and contact tracing to ensure that we contain any future outbreaks.

That means, every family physician should have access to coronavirus testing, and it would be routine when anybody comes in with ""influenza-like-illness"" to take a swab and submit it for testing with same-day turnaround -- ideally identifying it as ""flu"", ""covid"", or ""other"".

In the case where ""covid"" comes back, we quarantine the individual -- a legally-enforced self-quarantine -- and a contact-tracing team begins to work through their movements from the preceding week, identifying everybody they came in contact with, asking them to self-isolate, and scheduling testing for them. That way, we can identify the (presumably asymptomatic) source of their infection, as well as limiting the outward spread without shutting everything down.

I'm not an epidemiologist, but I've been learning about the topic -- and doing well enough that my March 8th predictions for US and CA infections are correct to within two days +/-. In my models that try to answer your question, the populations which fare the best are ones that follow the strategy I've outlined. The ones that fare the worst are the ones that re-open their economy without having learned anything."

> OBJECTIVE: The COVID-19 pandemic has caused much morbidity and mortality to patients but also health care providers. We tabulated the cases of physician deaths from COVID-19 associated with front-line work in hopes of mitigating future events. 

> METHOD: On April 5, 2020, Google internet search was performed using the keywords doctor, physician, death, COVID, COVID-19, and coronavirus in English and Farsi, and in Chinese using the Baidu search engine. 

> RESULTS: We found 198 physician deaths from COVID-19, but complete details were missing for 49 individuals. The average age of the physicians that died was 63.4 years (range 28 to 90 years) and the median age was 66 years of age. Ninety percent of the deceased physicians were male (175/194). General practitioners and emergency room doctors (78/192), respirologists (5/192), internal medicine specialists (11/192) and anesthesiologists (6/192) comprised 52% of those dying. Two percent of the deceased were epidemiologists (4/192), 2% were infectious disease specialists (4/192), 5% were dentists (9/192), 4% were ENT (8/192), and 4% were ophthalmologists (7/192). The countries with the most reported physician deaths were Italy (79/198), Iran (43/198), China (16/198), Philippines (14/198), United States (9/192) and Indonesia (7/192). 

> CONCLUSION: Physicians from all specialties may die from COVID, and these deaths will likely increase as the pandemic progresses. Lack of personal protective equipment was cited as a common cause of death. Consideration should be made to exclude older physicians from front-line work."

The production and shedding of infectious virus may also be host specific. Multiple host barriers to infection would each require one or more corresponding changes in the virus, making the host range barrier increasingly difficult to cross.”

I'm legitimately confused about the point you're trying to make here. It's not remotely accurate to compare covid-19 to the flu when 1) the flu isn't a coronavirus 2) the flu is not a new disease 3) there are several different strains of influenza. Because it's new (and a coronavirus), researchers are still learning about it's lethality, transmission, long-term effects, et cetera, or how to most effectively treat it. What we do know is that it spreads like most other respiratory virsues/coronaviruses, there's a period where someone can be infected but not show symptoms, and that it's more contagious than the flu.

Target has committed $10 million to expand relief and assistance to team members and organizations helping respond to the coronavirus. The $10 million donation supports four areas: team members, local communities, national organizations and global response organizations.

On top of previous donations of anti-viral and N95 respirator masks to first responders and healthcare professionals at more than 50 organizations across the country, Target has committed to donating an additional 2 million KN95 respirator masks to the medical community and will continue to explore ways to secure additional inventory for those in critical need.

Here are some of the ways we’re joining together to support communities in need:

• Donating $25,000 to hunger relief agencies to supplement the National School Lunch Program (NSLP) at Title 1 schools

• Converting our annual Depot Day of Service program to support the most disadvantaged schools and after-school programs across the country by donating over $200,000 in ‘Teacher Support Grants’ to Title I schools and ‘Youth Education Grants’ to after-school programs

• Donating a combined $50,000 to South Florida non-profits to aid in their COVID-19 relief programs

• Supporting an “Electronic Device Drive” for South Florida families in need to enable remote learning for students 

• Supporting “Work From Home” for South Florida teachers with specialty supplies and products

Weeks ago, The Home Depot voluntarily froze pricing nationwide across product categories in high demand due to COVID-19. We also executed a “Stop-Sale” on all N95 masks in stores and HomeDepot.com and redirected all shipments to be donated to hospitals, healthcare providers and first responders around the country. In fact, The Home Depot is donating millions of dollars in personal protective equipment (PPE) and other products and prioritizing fulfillment to hospitals, healthcare providers and first responders.

The Unemployment Insurance Agency records show you recently established a claim for unemployment benefits. This notice is to advise you that an addition to your weekly benefit amount, you are also entitled to receive an additional $600 per week in Federal Pandemic Unemployment Compensation (FPUC). The additional $600 is payable as part of the federal Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act and will be paid along with your weekly benefit entitlement. FPUC payments are payable for the weeks ending April 4, 2020 through the week ending July 25, 2020. The additional $600 per week will end when your benefit entitlement expires or the week ending July 25, 2020, whichever one comes first. You do not need to do anything additional to qualify for this payment; however, you must still continue to certify bi-weekly to receive the payment. 

The $600 FPUC payment will be retroactively paid for the week ending April 4, 2020. It is expected that payment of the additional $600 will begin after April 10, 2020. To date, UIA has taken over 900,000 claims; therefore, please allow for up to 7 days to receive the additional payment before contacting UIA. You can monitor your account online through your Michigan Web Account Manager (MiWAM).

The Berejiklian government's plans for residential rent relief will include deferring or even waiving land tax for landlords on the condition they pass on the savings to tenants.

NSW Treasurer Dominic Perrottet said the states had been working on ideas for rent relief following this week's national cabinet meeting.

“Offering a degree of land tax waiver or deferral for landlords is something we are finalising,"" Mr Perrottet said.

But Mr Perrottet urged tenants to keep paying rent. The government is keen to ensure relief measures only apply to people whose finances have been hit by the coronavirus crisis.
""Obviously many people are worried about keeping a roof over their head, but I don't believe something like a rent strike will ultimately help either party,"" Mr Perrottet said.

""This is a complicated area and both sides face challenges, and I urge landlords and tenants to work together to find solutions at this extremely difficult time.""

Rents are expected to drop in coming months, experts say, as a surge in rental properties combines with a drop in tenant demand due to the economic impact of COVID-19.

The number of rentals hitting the Sydney market over the past three weeks was up 18 per cent year-on-year, according to Domain figures.

A return of short-term holiday rentals to the longer-term market, a change in tenant circumstances and a drop off in migration are all behind the jump, according to Domain senior research analyst Nicola Powell.

""The big question is if this is going to continue. If it does, we will see downward pressure on rents,"" Dr Powell said.

Median Sydney asking rents rebounded over the first quarter — after reaching their lowest levels in years — according to the latest Domain Rent Report, but the turnaround could be over before it's truly begun.

Median rents rose 1 per cent for houses to $530 a week, and 2 per cent for units to $520 a week, off the back of a fall in unit completions at a time of steady population growth, Dr Powell said.

House rents are still $20 lower and unit rents $30 lower than the 2017-18 peak.

""Sydney house rents rose for the first time in three years and unit rents rose for the first time in two years ... [but] this trend is expected to be short-lived,"" Dr Powell said.

Meanwhile, Sydney's vacancy rate rose 20 basis points in March to 2.7 per cent, after trending down since mid-2019. There were an estimated 14,528 vacant rentals at the end of the month – 845 more than the previous month, with some landlords already slashing rents by hundreds of dollars a week to attract tenants.

Investors with vacant properties will be competing for tenants, Dr Powell said, so landlords with good tenants whose ability to pay rent has been affected will not want to lose them because of what will hopefully be a short period of uncertainty."

Das ist einfach faktisch falsch. Nach allem was wir wissen, werden an dieser Krankheit sehr viele Menschen sterben, wenn sie sich massiv verbreitet. Nur wenn man die Verbreitung verhindert, verhindert man, dass Menschen zu Hause verrecken, wenn die Intensivstation, die Gänge, die Parkhäuser, die Hotels und die Behelfszelte voll sind.

Es geht nicht nur um 90-jährige mit Diabetes und Lungenleiden. Es geht auch um 40-jährige mit Bluthochdruck. Und bei Millionen infizierten geht es statistisch auch um viele 20-jährige, Kerngesunde mit Pech. Und es geht einfach um sehr viele Menschen, obwohl es nicht annähernd um die Mehrheit geht.

MONTEREY, Calif. —
Researchers at Stanford Medicine are working to find out what proportion of Californians have already had COVID-19. The new study could help policymakers make more informed decisions during the coronavirus pandemic.
The team tested 3,200 people at three Bay Area locations on Saturday using an antibody test for COVID-19 and expect to release results in the coming weeks. The data could help to prove COVID-19 arrived undetected in California much earlier than previously thought.
The hypothesis that COVID-19 first started spreading in California in the fall of 2019 is one explanation for the state's lower than expected case numbers.
As of Tuesday, the state had 374 reported COVID-19 fatalities in a state of 40 million people, compared to New York which has seen 14 times as many fatalities and has a population half that of California. Social distancing could be playing a role but New York's stay-at-home order went into effect on March 22, three days after California implemented its order.
""Something is going on that we haven't quite found out yet,"" said Victor Davis Hanson a senior fellow with Stanford's Hoover Institute.
Hanson said he thinks it is possible COVID-19 has been spreading among Californians since the fall when doctors reported an early flu season in the state. During that same time, California was welcoming as many as 8,000 Chinese nationals daily into our airports. Some of those visitors even arriving on direct flights from Wuhan, the epicenter of the coronavirus outbreak in China.
""When you add it all up it would be naïve to think that California did not have some exposure,"" said Hanson.
For years California has been the No. 1 travel destination for Chinese tourists in the United States. Even after the U.S. halted flights from China this winter Chinese travelers were still able to come to California on flights from Europe and Canada.
Hanson said through all of this the Chinese have been disingenuous about the timing of the initial outbreak of COVID-19.
""They originally said it was in early January, then it got backdated to December and then early December and now they are saying as early as November 17,"" said Hanson.
If Californians were exposed earlier than the rest of the country to COVID-19 we may have had a chance to build up some herd immunity to the disease. We won't know if that is the case until results from the Stanford Medicine study come back.
On Friday and Saturday, the study's co-lead Eran Bendavid coordinated testing at sites in San Jose, Los Gatos and Mountain View. The teams used an antibody test from the company Premier Biotech. Technicians use a finger prick to draw blood for the test and it can tell within minutes if a person developed antibodies to COVID-19.
The same brand test is being offered at a lab in Monterey and healthcare workers there are closely watching the study. Spenser Smith with ARCpoint Labs is aware of the theory that COVID-19 arrived here as early as the fall and that some people may have had the virus unknowingly.
""Knowing the levels as to which that happened would be great and one of the tools you can use is this test,"" said Smith
ARCpoint Labs started offering the antibody test in Monterey last week and has since tested 500 people. Smith said ARC has had some positive results for COVID-19 and is reporting all results to Monterey County's Public Health Department.
Hanson said the testing could help us as we start the recovery process. He does not advocate lifting social distancing rules right now but said testing could help get some people back to work.
""It is going to allow us to get back to normal much more quickly because there will be many more people than we think that have anti-bodies,"" he said.
Positive results in recovered folks could get nurses and caregivers back on the front lines of the pandemic as well as dishwashers and small business owners who keep our economy going.
The results of the study could also help us all to feel less scared of COVID-19. Limited testing has resulted in an artificially high death rate. The more people we can test who have mild symptoms, who are asymptomatic or who have recovered the less-lethal COVID-19 will seem."

I just saw this [Sky News Australia video on Youtube](https://youtu.be/pKmUxSlOoUE?t=204) doing exactly that. They cropped out interview footage with a SCMP journalist, out of context and with some serious background music added, to the effect that it implies China knew about the corona virus in November.  

Turns out, that's not what she actually said. [In the original article she wrote](https://www.scmp.com/news/china/society/article/3074991/coronavirus-chinas-first-confirmed-covid-19-case-traced-back), all it says is that scientists in China have, RETROSPECTIVELY, traced the first possible patient zero case to a 55 year old man in November 17. It was a study to try and map the pattern of early transmission, and how undetected and undocumented cases contributed to this. 

There is rampant propaganda being spread by everybody to deflect blame. It's amazing how quick redditors are to point out Chinese propaganda, but are so oblivious to propaganda from their own politicians."

He was obsessive about having a clean restaurant before all this so I asked his opinion. He told me in his store the only thing they started doing differently was wiping down the customer tables with bleach cleaner instead of their regular cleaner. But their normal procedures for operating and making food were all ready far beyond any CDC recommendations for Covid19. He told me if you trusted a place
To be clean before they are probably still just as clean if not better. His store does pay in advance and contactless pick ups or delivery now and he says they are slammed with orders. They also make meals for a charity organization that provides them to low income kids so I’m pretty proud that he is able to keep his employees who want to work employed. 

So personally, we are getting take out once a week still from our trusted local restaurants. I’m sticking with places that allow me to pay in advance and do contactless pick up. I’m also only ordering from places who have made an effort to post or communicate how they are handling the situation, what they have changed, and how they are protecting their own employees. 

I have adopted a system that is probably over kill but we bring the food home the packaging. Wash hands after touching containers. Put food on our plates and then wash before eating.

Our local places are begging for customers and trying their best to stay afloat. And it is a nice break each week to order food and not have to make every single breakfast, lunch, dinner and snack every single day!

* If they catch the disease then not only are they at risk, but so are their other patients who often are so vulnerable they will certainly die if they catch it


* We absolutely cannot afford to have any NHS workers sick at the moment. As many as possible need to be in work.

The coronavirus pandemic is killing hundreds of people in New York City each day. 
To accommodate the dead before families claim them, the city's medical examiner expanded temporary refrigerated storage to hold 3,600 decedents instead of the usual 900.
However, a policy change posted to the medical examiner's website suggests that room is running out: Bodies that families don't claim within six days of death will be catalogued and interred in a mass grave site on a Bronx island.
Funeral directors say other policies described by the medical examiner during a conference call on Tuesday could make it even harder to serve families. 
Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.
As coronavirus infections peak in New York City, its morgues are quickly running out of room, exceeding their already vastly expanded capacity.

The city's Office of the Chief Medical Examiner quietly posted a significant policy change to its website on Tuesday: Instead of holding some bodies in refrigerated city storage for 30 days until they are claimed by families, the city will now hold them for less than a week.

Starting Tuesday, decedents who are not claimed by a funeral home within that short window will be sent to the Bronx's Hart Island, where a mass graveyard called City Cemetery contains more than 1 million unclaimed bodies — the largest such site in the US.

""As we aim to accommodate the many New Yorkers who have been impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, the New York City Office of Chief Medical Examiner (OCME) will provide temporary storage of a decedent for up to six days,"" the office said on its website. ""If a decedent has not been claimed within six days, the decedent will be transferred for temporary interment at City Cemetery.""

Those who are interred can either be removed by family members or left at rest at no cost, the site added.

An average of 245 people have died each day within the city's five boroughs from COVID-19, or roughly one person every six minutes. The number is likely even higher, though, since the official count does not include ""probable"" deaths from the pandemic; as many as 200 more per day may be dying from the coronavirus, according to Gothamist.

""I don't know how many more bodies I can take,"" Patrick Marmo, a funeral home operator based on Brooklyn, previously told Business Insider. He added: ""No one in the New York City area possibly has enough equipment to care for human remains of this magnitude.""

Aja Worthy-Davis, a spokesperson for OCME, directed Business Insider to the website in response to inquiries about the policy change, but did not immediately answer further questions — including whether ""claiming"" a body requires physical removal within the stipulated six days, or just claiming online via an existing system.

Worthy-Davis told Business Insider on Monday that ""we currently have adequate space for decedents."" She noted that the city has built tent facilities and parked more than 80 refrigerated trucks and trailers near hospitals to accommodate about 3,600 bodies in refrigerated storage — a vast expansion of typical storage for 900 bodies. As of Monday, she said, the city had not changed the timeline in which families had to claim bodies. 
A day later, however, both situations had changed.

Business Insider learned of the shift on Tuesday from two New York-licensed funeral directors whose identities are known to us but who asked not to be named for fear of retaliation from city or state authorities.

'They're not supporting us'

OCME held a conference call with funeral directors on Tuesday afternoon to go over the changes and answer questions, the two people familiar with the matter said.

According to notes taken by a person on the call and reviewed by Business Insider, OCME also said the city's funeral industry would have to pay for its own temporary storage, despite requests from funeral directors for trucks similar to those at hospitals. Moreover, the office recommended that funeral directors store embalmed bodies (which do not decay as readily) for several weeks to accommodate an immediate need to deal with surging fatalities.

Hospitals can now also determine time limits for their temporary morgue storage — perhaps shorter than OCME's six-day limit prior to interment on Hart Island — according to the meeting notes. 

One funeral director said these changes will strain an already overburdened ""deathcare"" industry, which conveys the bodies of deceased relatives to a final resting place. That system in New York is struggling to find proper storage to accommodate families' requests, and its workers are putting in grueling hours (at significant risk of exposure) to handle the remains of those killed by COVID-19.

""It makes it look like it's our fault when it's not our fault. It's the city's fault for not helping us,"" the person said of OCME's policy change. ""They're not supporting us.""

The funeral director also explained that the process of disinterring remains from Hart Island is complex. Bodies buried there are cataloged in an online database so their location is precisely known, as are their names and other identifying records, to the extent such information is known.

But it's not easy for families to claim human remains on Hart Island. To retrieve them, the person said, ""they get prisoners to dig the body up, they put it in a special holding cell, then you have to take a special ferry, which only accommodates one funeral director at a time.""

If hundreds or even thousands of bodies are buried there in the coming weeks, families might have to wait until long after the pandemic subsides to claim and move loved ones to a final resting place.

""It's going to take years to get bodies off of Hart Island at that rate,"" the funeral director said.

For those reasons, the person suggested it'd be preferable to temporarily inter bodies in public parks if the city's refrigerated storage runs out. Such a plan was outlined in a 2016 contingency plan by OCME for a surge in city fatalities.

Mark Levine, the chair of the New York city council health committee, said via Twitter on Monday that this scenario was about to happen, but he later walked back the notion.

""I have spoken to many folks in City gov't today, and received unequivocal assurance that there will be *no* burials in NYC Parks,"" Levine later tweeted. ""All have stated clearly that if temporary interment should be needed it will be done on Hart Island.""

A nonprofit called the Hart Island Project recorded drone footage of a mass burial at City Cemetery on April 2. However, it is not clear if the scene was typical of unclaimed body burials for the city — they occur on a weekly basis — or unusually large, given the number of pandemic-related fatalities."

I don't think it'll do any good, but 'not actively hurting anybody' is the low bar to which I hold most government operations. To highlight the actual bill:

> will be asked to fill out a travel declaration form

So, they're asking, not telling at point of law. Which is good, I guess. But they're leveraging a few tools in the toolkit that we should be uncomfortable with, to wit:

- Geofencing

- Leveraging the federal emergency system (the same one that produces Amber Alerts)

- Getting telemetry from cellular providers as to number of phones crossing the geofence in order to measure compliance

Basically, the state of Utah is using federal funds to create a system whereby crossing into the state trips an Amber-Alert-esque message, and the cell provider data is then aggregated into a report to measure compliance. They are not subpoenaing subscripber data with this, so at least that particular invasion of privacy is off the table.

What this will tell the state is that X number of phones crossed a particular border, and some number (Y) responses were received. Percentages will be difficult to measure - lots of people have two cell phones. Some people still rock non smart-phones. If you've got 2 adults and 3 kids in the car, it'll be two phones for 5 people.

The state gov is trying to use phones as a proxy for people, which is likely to be meaningless. They'll end up with a low compliance rate (I'd wager 10-20%), all of which will indicate ""Nope, no coronavirus here!"" because nobody admits to anything problematic on any kind of survey.

My concern is that once the inefficacy of a program like this is exposed, it'll get elevated to the next step - either capture of subscriber data or actual checkpoints, both of which are rife with civil liberties problems.

EDIT: California has had produce inspection checkpoints forever, including at almost all crossings into California (like at US-6, which nobody takes). California has some really rosy [marketing material](https://www.cdfa.ca.gov/plant/pe/exteriorexclusion/borders.html) on them. They are eminently pointless for private vehicles (and essentially operate as a jobs program), but nonetheless the program passes constitutional muster.

I believe it'd be a bad idea for Utah to implement physical checkpoints, even if they would be constitutional. The virtual checkpoint won't help, but it won't hurt, either, whereas physical checkpoints would require a great deal of resource diversion to implement."

In February and early March, America’s political and business leaders began to face a crisis of potentially catastrophic proportions. Many failed the test.

As the coronavirus crisis emerged, the president dithered and downplayed, promising a magical end to a problem he did not appear to understand. The mayor of New York reveled in unscientific happy talk, assuring his citizens that life would remain normal. And many in the pundit class, including yours truly, got the earliest calls disastrously wrong.

This is the story we know — a story of institutional failure, of chaos and incoordination, a tragedy that has seemed to unmake the most powerful country in the world.

Yet failure is not the entire account of America’s response to the coronavirus. Because while politicians in Washington, D.C., fumbled the federal role, Washington State was closing restaurants and bars. While New York City slow-walked, the San Francisco Bay Area, and then the rest of California, was ordering its residents to “shelter in place.” And as the Republican president offered meaningless bromides, two Republican governors, Mike DeWine of Ohio and Larry Hogan of Maryland, were among those leading the nation’s first statewide school closures.

There are many reasons different parts of the country have experienced such different outbreaks — urban density, air pollution and many other variables.

Still, bold, early pushes for social distancing appear to have paid off immensely. The Bay Area, where I live, reported some of the first “community spread” coronavirus cases in the country. Now the region is leading the nation in “flattening the curve.”

Ohio, too, has begun to see signs of success. And in Washington State, where an early outbreak at a Seattle-area nursing home left dozens dead, cases have tapered off so quickly that the state is now returning hospital ventilators to the nation’s stockpile.

Over the last few days, I reached out to Gavin Newsom, the Democratic governor of California; Jay Inslee, the Democratic governor of Washington; and Mike DeWine, Ohio’s Republican governor. I also spoke to London Breed, the mayor of San Francisco, and Brad Smith, the president of Microsoft, one of the first large companies to direct its employees to work from home.

I asked them all a simple question: How did you get the coronavirus so right so early, when so many other leaders missed the boat?

Here’s what we can all learn from their success.

They heeded clear warnings.
You can’t respond to a crisis if you don’t recognize the crisis. This sounds obvious, but it was an unusual superpower for the leaders who moved quickly: They kept their eyes open. They were lucky enough to get an early peek at the disaster, and they were wise enough to take the warning seriously.

Sometimes the signs were unmissable — Microsoft had insight into the virus because of its extensive operations in China, Smith told me.

But other indicators were murkier. For Newsom, the first hint of trouble was repatriation — in January, the federal government began bringing back Americans from affected areas of China, many to military bases in California. Newsom told me that working on the issue got him and the state’s other top officials thinking seriously about what was to come. The repatriations, Newsom said, “underscored a sense of curiosity and significance that this crisis is about to hit our state.”

They trusted the experts.
Again, obvious, and again, so rare: These leaders understood the limits of their own knowledge, and when faced with tough choices, they deferred to the experts.

“I didn’t do very well in school in science,” DeWine told me. But after a long career in politics — DeWine has served in the U.S. House and Senate, and was elected to the governor’s office in 2018 — he’d learned to recognize the value of expertise.

“When I’ve made decisions that I’ve regretted,” DeWine said, it was often because “I didn’t have enough facts, I didn’t ask enough questions, I didn’t ask the right people.”

Last year, DeWine appointed Amy Acton, a well-regarded physician and public health academic, as the director of the Ohio Department of Health. As the virus approached, Acton alerted him to the threat posed by the Arnold Sports Festival, a bodybuilding gathering founded by Arnold Schwarzenegger that had been scheduled to take place in Columbus in early March.

“We looked at all the facts, and we came to the conclusion that it did not make any sense to have 60,000 spectators come into Columbus for four days,” DeWine said. Canceling the event was a huge move — few gatherings had been shut down anywhere in the country, and the economic impact was in the tens of millions. Festival organizers resisted the decision, and Ohio got a court order to shut down the event.

“That was, frankly, a very gut-wrenching decision,” DeWine said. “But we made that decision based on the evidence.”

They moved forcefully but incrementally.
All these leaders understood that slowing the virus required asking people to make huge disruptions to their lives — to stop everything, stay inside, to forget about school and work. They knew they couldn’t ask it all at once; they would have to prepare the public, over weeks, for a new reality.

“Part of what I tried to do from the very beginning,” Breed told me, “is to reassure the public that, look, it’s just a matter of time.” Though it might be easier to tell people that there was nothing much to worry about, that wouldn’t help anyone in the long run. “I wanted people to start to get ready, because it’s going to hit San Francisco, and it’s going to impact our city in a significant way,” she said.

The strength of local institutions also played an important role — in places that moved early, business leaders, municipal governments and state governments had established years of coordination that proved pivotal.

“We had the benefit of enlightened business and community leaders,” Inslee said, referring to Microsoft and other large Seattle-area companies.

Smith, of Microsoft, echoed this sentiment: “Too often, people in the tech sector think that they can find the answer to anything, because they’ve been smart and successful — and I thought it was of fundamental importance that we not think that we’re as smart as the experts, and so we turned to the public health experts in King County and listened to them on Day 1.”

In that vein, there was something else very unusual in the places that moved first, too — actual bipartisanship. DeWine worked with Ohio’s biggest cities, many run by Democrats, to impose social distancing; Inslee and Newsom had to consult with many Republican officials.

“It’s the science of the lifeboat,” Inslee told me. “When you’re all in the same lifeboat, there just isn’t room. When you’re in the middle of a storm, you got to keep the lifeboat afloat.”

This planet of ours is a lifeboat, too, and vast parts of it are growing uninhabitable. To fix it, we’ll have to learn from the leaders who are curious enough to recognize the coming dangers, and brave enough to take them on."

**Van Dissel: People after mild corona symptoms might not be immune**

People who have been infected with the coronavirus and had mild symptoms are not automatically immune afterwards. RIVM boss Jaap van Dissel said in a briefing in the Lower House on Wednesday that there is a group that may not build up immunity after mild coronary complaints.

In this group, an infection with mild complaints also means that they do not always produce the required amount of antibodies. ""This immediately means that it becomes complex to interpret whether someone who has had mild complaints has also built up immunity,"" says Van Dissel.

At the moment it is not yet known whether these persons are susceptible to new infections and whether this group builds up immunity. The RIVM is still investigating this. Research is also taking place into the spread of the virus in nursing homes. Corona has been diagnosed in 900 of the 2,500 nursing homes.

Cabinet policy is to 'monitor' the virus as much as possible until a vaccine is available. This means that the most vulnerable groups are protected and everything is done to ensure that care and intensive care are not overdemanded. At the same time, the virus will circulate through society and group immunity must be built up.

Van Dissel said that further research is needed to see whether immunity can be established in people who have had mild symptoms. It is important that more tests are carried out. These tests must be combined with research to identify who an infected person has been in contact with."

Release Date: 4/8/2020 5:33:00 PM

By Chief of Naval Operations, Adm. Mike Gilday

WASHINGTON (NNS) -- The events of the past week have been difficult for our Navy and our nation. We will learn from them. But make no mistake, we are moving forward. The Navy has our orders and we are executing them.

As I write, we have thousands of Sailors on mission, above, under, and on the seas as well as here at home on the front lines of the coronavirus crisis. We’re operating far forward on 90 ships, including three aircraft carriers and two big deck amphibious ships. Navy Cyber teams are defending our networks.  Seabees are converting commercial buildings into medical facilities across six states. Three thousand Navy doctors, nurses and corpsmen, including hundreds of reservists, are caring for our fellow Americans on USNS MERCY, COMFORT, in New York City’s Javits Center, and in civilian hospitals. Hundreds more deployed to treat the sick in Dallas and New Orleans. The NIMITZ carrier strike group and her air wing at Lemoore are in 14 day Restriction of Movement (ROM) as they ramp up to deploy. Same for our SSBN crews. Countless more Sailors are leaning in to support them – across our fleet staffs, intelligence centers, training facilities, and supply depots. More than six thousand recruits at Great lakes are preparing to head to the fleet.

Given this, I have three priorities for us right now. First, our health and safety. Second, ongoing fleet operations and our support to the coronavirus effort. Third, continuing to generate the enormous amount of support required to keep #1 and #2 on track. I know much of that effort is behind the scenes and out of the limelight – but every bit of it is critical.

We must ensure the health of the force. And we must be laser-focused on the Fleet – from manning to maintenance, and from training to warfighting. Operational readiness is our job… and every one of us has a role. Nobody sits the bench.

Everyone must pull together. And in this new environment of coronavirus, we’re all learning, adapting, and improving by the hour. There is no better example of this than USS THEODORE ROOSEVELT – staring down an invisible enemy – dedicated in their efforts – making phenomenal progress, and providing lessons for the Navy and beyond. 

America. Has. A. Great. Navy. Our nation counts on you and so do I.  Never more proud to be your CNO.

2020-04-08,Snipuh21,Coronavirus,9,https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/fx8w8w/where_have_all_the_heart_attacks_gone/fmss2kn/,"The hospitals are eerily quiet, except for Covid-19.

I have heard this sentiment from fellow doctors across the United States and in many other countries. We are all asking: Where are all the patients with heart attacks and stroke? They are missing from our hospitals.

Yale New Haven Hospital, where I work, has almost 300 people stricken with Covid-19, and the numbers keep rising — and yet we are not yet at capacity because of a marked decline in our usual types of patients. In more normal times, we never have so many empty beds.

Our hospital is usually so full that patients wait in gurneys along the walls of the emergency department for a bed to become available on the general wards or even in the intensive care unit. We send people home from the hospital as soon as possible so we can free up beds for those who are waiting. But the pandemic has caused a previously unimaginable shift in the demand for hospital services.

Some of the excess capacity is indeed by design. We canceled elective procedures, though many of those patients never needed hospitalization. We are now providing care at home through telemedicine, but those services are for stable outpatients, not for those who are acutely ill.

What is striking is that many of the emergencies have disappeared. Heart attack and stroke teams, always poised to rush in and save lives, are mostly idle. This is not just at my hospital. My fellow cardiologists have shared with me that their cardiology consultations have shrunk, except those related to Covid-19. In an [informal Twitter poll](https://twitter.com/angioplastyorg/status/1245892249101074432?s=20) by [@angioplastyorg, an online community of cardiologists,](http://angioplasty.org/) almost half of the respondents reported that they are seeing a 40 percent to 60 percent reduction in admissions for heart attacks; about 20 percent reported more than a 60 percent reduction.

And this is not a phenomenon specific to the United States. Investigators [from Spain reported](https://www.recintervcardiol.org/es/?option=com_content&view=article&id=344&catid=14) a 40 percent reduction in emergency procedures for heart attacks during the last week of March compared with the period just before the pandemic hit.

And it may not just be heart attacks and strokes. [Colleagues on Twitter report](https://twitter.com/MandaChelednik/status/1246793095032852480?s=20) a decline in many other emergencies, including acute appendicitis and acute gall bladder disease.

The most concerning possible explanation is that people stay home and suffer rather than risk coming to the hospital and getting infected with coronavirus. This theory suggests that Covid-19 has instilled fear of face-to-face medical care. As a result, many people with urgent health problems may be opting to remain at home rather than call for help. And when they do finally seek medical attention, it is often only after their condition has worsened. Doctors from Hong Kong [reported](https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/CIRCOUTCOMES.120.006631) an increase in patients coming to the hospital late in the course of their heart attack, when treatment is less likely to be lifesaving.

There are other possible explanations for the missing patients. In this time of social distancing, our meals, social interactions and physical activity patterns tend to be very different. Maybe we have removed some of the triggers for heart attacks and strokes, like excessive eating and drinking or abrupt periods of physical exertion. This theory merits research but seems unlikely to explain the dramatic changes we’re observing.

We actually expected to see more heart attacks during this time. Respiratory infections typically increase the risk of heart attacks. [Studies](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3139921/) suggest that recent respiratory infections can double the risk of a heart attack or stroke. The risk seems to begin soon after the respiratory infection develops, so any rise in heart attacks or strokes should be evident by now. We [urge people to get flu vaccines](https://www.cardiosmart.org/News-and-Events/2019/03/Flu-Shot-Helps-Prevent-Heart-Attack) every year, in part, to protect their hearts.

Also, times of stress increase the risk of heart attacks and strokes. Depression, anxiety and frustration, feelings that the pandemic might exacerbate, are all associated with a doubling or more of heart attack risks. Work and life stress, which also may be higher with the acute disruptions we’ve all been going through, can markedly increase the risk of a heart attack. Moreover, events like earthquakes or terrorist attacks or war, in which an entire society is exposed to a stressor, are risk factors for heart attacks. Finally, Covid-19 can actually affect the heart, which should be increasing the number of patients with heart problems.

Experts are bringing together data to confirm these patterns. We hope to gain a greater understanding of their causes and consequences.

Meanwhile, the immediate message to patients is clear: Don’t delay needed treatment. If fear of the pandemic leads people to delay or avoid care, then the death rate will extend far beyond those directly infected by the virus. Time to treatment dictates the outcomes for people with heart attacks and strokes. These deaths may not be labeled Covid-19 deaths, but surely, they are collateral damage.

The public needs to know that hospitals are equipped not only to care for people with Covid-19 but also those who have other life-threatening health problems. Yes, we in health care are working to keep people out of the hospital if we can, but we can safely provide care for those people who are not sick from Covid-19. Masks and protective gear for health care workers and patients go a long way to ensure a safe environment. Also, people with chronic conditions need to know that avoidance of needed care could ultimately be as big a threat as the virus itself.

As we fight coronavirus, we need to combat perceptions that everyone else must stay away from the hospital. The pandemic toll will be much worse if it leads people to avoid care for life-threatening, yet treatable, conditions like heart attacks and strokes.

([population](https://www.worldometers.info/world-population/population-by-country/) * [per capita](https://www.macrotrends.net/countries/USA/united-states/death-rate)

+ COVID 19 was responsible for [1,970](https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/#countries) deaths in the US yesterday, nearly quadruple the daily peak of [508](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2020/04/01/coronavirus-kills-1-000-single-day-u-s-double-flu/5100905002/)
 deaths from the flu.

+ Therefore, COVID 19 is increasing the ""normal"" daily mortality rate of Americans above the expected by [~25%](https://www.google.com/search?q=1970%2F8000).  

+ Since 04/01/20 COVID 19 has been the [3rd highest](https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2020/04/the-rapid-increase-of-u-s-coronavirus-deaths-in-one-graphic.html) daily cause of death after heart disease and cancer..  Since 04/07/20 COVID 19 is *the* daily leading cause of death in the US.

+ The US contains only [4.25%](https://www.worldometers.info/world-population/population-by-country/) of the world population but approximately [28%](https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/#countries) of worldwide confirmed cases of COVID 19 are within the US.

+  Europe contains only [10%](https://www.worldometers.info/world-population/population-by-country/) of the world population but approximately [47 %](https://ncov2019.live/data) of worldwide confirmed cases of COVID 19 are within Europe.

This is a higher number of Americans than those killed on [9/11](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casualties_of_the_September_11_attacks).  On that day, COVID 19 will be the leading cause of death in the US by far.

Yesterday [437](https://infection2020.com/) NYC residents died of COVID 19, a [~297%](https://www.google.com/search?q=437%2F147) increase over ""normal"", for a total of **over 4 times a ""normal"" amount of dead residents yesterday.**. The death rate seems to be [slowing](https://abc7ny.com/coronavirus-nyc-new-york-ny-news-update-cases-map/5989875/), but already more NYC residents have now died of COVID 19 than died on 9/11.

+ [Lions and Tigers](https://abc7ny.com/coronavirus-nyc-news-updates-new-york/6079276/) in the Bronx zoo have been confirmed to have COVID 19 after contact with an asymptomatic zoo keeper.  I assume these cases are not included in NY's tallies.


At the current rate of fatalities, even if the growth curve stops flat today, COVID 19 would officially become the most deadly pandemic in a century by [May 23rd](https://youtu.be/sz1bGzYdRdk).

We need to flatten the [curve](https://infection2020.com/) and slow the spread, it's our only chance. When the hospital beds are full, that's game over.  This scale is astronomical.  Everyone that is currently kept alive normally through the modern medicine we take for granted every day is just going to die when there just *aren't any doctors or supplies to spare*.  It's gonna get medieval up in here.

Gov. Gavin Newsom [expressed optimism](https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2020-04-07/california-coronavirus-curve-bending-gavin-newsom) Tuesday, saying California has no longer been reporting double-digit increases in hospitalization rates. Still, he cautioned that tougher days are ahead and forecast a peak of sick patients in May.

One vulnerable populations that remains are those in nursing homes, where the virus can spread easily.

A long-term-care skilled nursing facility in a Seattle suburb was an [early epicenter of the outbreak](https://www.latimes.com/world-nation/story/2020-03-15/nursing-home-visitors-coronavirus-life-care-center-kirkland-washington), where two-thirds of residents and 47 workers fell ill and [37 people died](https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2020-03-31/hospitals-nursing-homes-become-battleground-as-california-coronavirus-deaths-rise).

Of the 21 people who have died from COVID-19 in California’s San Mateo County, 15 resided in congregate-care settings. The Los Angeles County public health director said Tuesday it would be “[perfectly appropriate](https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2020-04-07/coronavirus-nursing-homes-residents-remove-la-county)” for families to pull loved ones out of long-term-care facilities; as of Tuesday, 21% of L.A. County’s 173 coronavirus deaths were among residents of nursing homes or assisted living centers. 

## Risk of ending social distancing too early

Dr. Howard Markel, a professor of the history of medicine at the University of Michigan, said deploying stay-at-home measures required a degree of patience not to pull back too early.

“If you pull the triggers off too early, not only is there a circulating virus to do what it naturally does, but you will have incurred all the economic and social disruptions of \[stay-at-home orders\] for nothing,” Markel said in a [webinar](https://covid19conversations.org/webinars/science-of-social-distancing-1) hosted by the American Public Health Assn. last month.

Markel said that during the [1918 flu pandemic](https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2020-03-16/los-angeles-spanish-flu-coronavirus), more than 20 U.S. cities that relaxed physical distancing orders too quickly — even as the flu virus was still circulating — soon saw a new rise in cases.

Exactly how officials might envision pulling back coronavirus stay-at-home orders, and to what extent people can return to their workplaces, is not yet known.

“It’s very, very difficult to know what parts we can scale back without compromising the progress that we’ve made,” Cody told the Santa Clara County Board of Supervisors.

## Social distancing into 2022?

Some say that periods of social distancing may need to continue over the next two years.

A [mathematical model](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.22.20041079v1.full.pdf) developed by researchers at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health suggested that a one-time effort at social distancing, as the U.S. is undertaking this spring, wouldn’t be enough to keep coronavirus case levels low enough to prevent hospital systems from being overwhelmed.

If it’s true that the coronavirus can spread more easily in the autumn and winter, there could be a resurgence of infections later this year. 

As a result, we might need long periods of social distancing, “perhaps with occasional periods of loosening,” to keep only a fraction of the population infected with the coronavirus at any one time, until a point at which large future outbreaks would be avoided, the Harvard study said.

Under one plausible scenario, social distancing measures could be fully relaxed by early to mid-2021, with the epidemic concluding by July 2022, Harvard researchers said. At that point, the coronavirus is anticipated to circulate seasonally, peaking in the winter.

Increasing the capacity of intensive care units would permit for longer breaks between periods of social distancing, said one of the authors of the study, Marc Lipsitch, epidemiology professor and director of the Center for Communicable Disease Dynamics at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health.

“This is not an easy policy,” Lipsitch said at the American Public Health Assn. webinar last month. “I’m not under illusions that this would be easy to do.”

## Cases will rise when stay-home orders ease

The public should realize that coronavirus cases are likely to rise when stay-at-home orders are eased, said Smith, the Santa Clara County executive. 

Fauci said during Monday’s news conference that he felt confident that over a period of time — [likely 12 to 18 months](https://www.latimes.com/science/story/2020-03-12/why-does-it-take-so-long-to-make-a-coronavirus-vaccine) — a good vaccine would emerge. Along with new therapies coming online, he said he was confident “we will never have to get back to where we are right now. So if that means getting back to normal, then we’ll get back to normal.”"

If you have concerns about your child's appointment, my advice is to speak to your child's doctor - or at the very least an experienced nurse at the practice - about your concerns; a receptionist is not sufficient.  They know you and your child best and will be able to best direct you.  This is even more important now, as different primary practices have their own guidelines and protocols to follow with respect to the novel Coronavirus outbreak.

Absent any other information, in a vacuum, my advice any parent would be to attend every recommended well child visit.  Frequent face-to-face visits are important when it comes to checking on children's health, especially under one year."

Don’t let your parents make you feel bad for saving money. You’re being a responsible adult, they should be thrilled.

Now may be an opportune time to exit your parents place, but ONLY IF YOU ARE READY. The excuse of, “I don’t want to accidentally bring coronavirus home and get you all sick so I’m gonna move out” might deflect them from the real reason you want to move. Just make sure that you’re ready to move out financially speaking. But one of those jobs with benefits would probably help.

Your parents have taken care of you since you were a baby, sometimes it’s hard for them to let go of that control when they see you becoming more independent. It doesn’t mean they don’t love you.

Becoming independent of your parents can be great. Just make sure you think it through first. Remember that to go or stay, is ultimately your choice now that you’re an adult. :)

Get a chest Xray maybe. Labs may show low lymphocytes on differential, elevated ferritin if you want to get fancy. Send a COVID swab if you suspect. Send them home if they look stable with instructions (see the CDC website for guidelines). Otherwise, admit them.

For floor patients, supportive care, give supplemental oxygen as needed, control fever for patient's comfort. Watch for signs of dyspnea. Antibiotic coverage according to your local ID recommendation. Other covid meds (?hydroxychloroquine) per local custom.

For ICU patients, supportive care. Remdesevir or IL-6 inhibitor trial if you can get in to one. Supplemental oxygen - hi flow - intubation per local custom. ARDS protocol if they are looking ARDS-y. Otherwise regular ICU care.

But if you have no prior ICU experience, it's unlikely you'd be taking care of ICU patients.

Because it just doesn't make sense a lot of it. Like here for example 
[UK Gov document](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/high-consequence-infectious-diseases-hcid)

'As of March 19th 2020 Covid-19 is no longer considered to be a high consequence infectious disease. And that the mortality rates were low overall.

So why is everything else in complete contrast to that statement?

These are death statistics that I've seen stating  deaths increased from previous years by around 500, I think it said that... the link is here [death stats UK](https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/birthsdeathsandmarriages/deaths/datasets/weeklyprovisionalfiguresondeathsregisteredinenglandandwales)


(I will use my town as an example) within less than a decade the population has increased here by over 200,000 people, so of course annually more people will die due to population growth. All the larger cities population has increased, so surely more people will die. How do we know everyone they say died of coronavirus really died of coronavirus? 

The UK Government statistics, before this virus, also stated that approximately 1400 die PER DAY in the UK. If that amount die in a day anyway in the UK, what about USA? Texas alone is three times bigger than UK and that's just one state!! 

What were those 1400 all dying of? No one talked about that. Now suddenly, for example 500 people die in a day and its attributed to Coronavirus. So, is that an additional 500 people to the 1400 who would have typically died in one day? Or it is within those estimates? 

Then there is obvious fake news like this. Who even knows if that photo is real when they have this technology [this person does not exist ](https://www.thispersondoesnotexist.com/)

That's true but it's arguably because it was based on prior data that was skewed too high for reasons that are [now increasingly understood.](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/fpar6e/new_update_from_the_oxford_centre_for/fll7ko7/) Generally, it seems that the places CV19 surges earliest tend to remain the places hit worst by CV19. We know that CV19 is falling across most of Italy and China yet the vast majority of those countries never reached anything approaching the worst areas in those countries. If the same holds true in the U.S., then the early surge in NY and a few other locations won't be widely repeated elsewhere, yet those numbers skew the IMHE model higher because they were first and largest.

The meta-value of having a clear and updating model is that it's allowing everyone from political leadership to the media to the doomers in /r/Coronavirus to see that our earlier projections were substantially too high which means the assumptions those earlier projections were based on were also too high. That means that our worst-case fears were, happily, incorrect and now we need to deal with, as you say, ""what is happening on the ground today."""

If someone gets seriously injured at this and needs to go to hospital, the UFC will also be responsible for emergency services being drawn away from the medical response to coronavirus victims. There is no way you can claim that is essential."

He also said last week that people should vote in Wisconsin because it would be safe enough if they sanitized, which is of course a lie that directly goes against CDC guidelines.

Bernie had effectively put his campaign on hiatus for several weeks, and even turned his donation drives into charity drives, while calling for mail-only or delayed elections. A suspected reason for Bernie dropping out is that he realizes that people will die if he stays in the race, because states refuse to do the right thing."

""The blunt truth is coronavirus is driving these very tragic deaths,” de Blasio said on CNN's “New Day.” He added, “We’re not talking about, you know, 10 people, 20 people. We’re talking about something like 100, 200 people per day.” The city's Fire Department has recorded as many as 200 deaths at home daily in recent weeks, far more than the average 25 deaths at home before the pandemic. De Blasio said the city would start including in its official tally of deaths people who died at home without a test.""

Here is Cuomo talking about hospitalizations going down and calling it good news.

I recall reading on the New York Times, that while they interviewing the doctors, that the Doctors stated that hospitals were being less restrictive in allowing people to be treated in the hospitals compared to this week. I'm trying to find the source because this information needs to spread because it's very important that people understand the true nature of what is going on in New York.

Later on, I'll look for the source and give it to you if you ask for it. But either way, you can see in the comment sections of the New York Times that many are complaining that they are not being allowed into the hospitals unless their illness is severe.

The ISS (Italian Health Agency) has only reported 48 total deaths of health care workers (doctors, nurses, therapists and other practiconers):

https://www.epicentro.iss.it/coronavirus/bollettino/Bollettino-sorveglianza-integrata-COVID-19_6-aprile-2020.pdf

Yet, the paper cites 79 reported physicians deaths.

If they are taking their numbers from the editorial which listed a number of Italian doctors who had passed away recently then there might be some serious issues with that data.

I had commented on this earlier when the media was reporting 61 doctors had died on the frontlines as a result of COVID-19.

This is what I found back then:

The source for every report of dying doctors in Italy appears to be an editorial, or blog on the FNOMCeO site.

The ages of the doctors varies but many are listed as being born on the 1930's and 1940's. I wanted to see if I could find out a bit more of their personal stories so simply Google searched their names. In a random sampling of two of the listed doctors, General Practiconer Domenico De Gilio and General Practiconer Andrea Carli I found the following results:

Domenico De Gilio: ""As a municipality - the mayor Stefano Cassinelli has made it known - we do not know that the doctor De Gilio had contracted the Coronavirus, I personally have not received any reports from Ats, but I recognize that it is difficult to have the data always accurate in this delicate situation and changing"".

From what he learned, Dr. De Gilio, born in 1953, had long struggled with the disease, a circumstance that had forced him, in recent months, to stop work. His condition worsened with the onset of the epidemic.

https://lecconotizie.com/cronaca/mandello-cronaca/coronavirus-si-e-spento-domenico-de-gilio-medico-di-base-a-dervio/

Andrea Carli: “My husband has not been breathing alone, hasn’t moved for days, hasn’t eaten and drinks very little. He and I have been here for a week now, alone. We don’t wait until it’s too late to get him back to Italy.” Pinuccia Lombardi, a retired former teacher and wife of Andrea Carli, the doctor from Sant’Angelo Lodigiano who works in Codogno, 69, is very proven. Last week he was found positive for coronavirus when he felt bad during a trip. in a group in India.

Last week he was found positive for coronavirus when he felt bad during a trip. in a group in India. Of the other 23 in the group, 14 (the positive ones) were hospitalized in Delhi or repatriated. The couple, on the other hand, has been stuck for days in Jaipur at the SMS Hospital in Jaipur. The wife also tested positive for the swab but is asymptomatic.

https://www.news1.news/a/2020/03/coronavirus-the-wife-of-codognos-doctor-stuck-in-india-help-us-we-are-here-alone.htm

So, that was only two doctors who I checked the personal history of. One hasn't even been able to practice medicine in months due to some other illness and hasn't even been confirmed positive for SARS-COV2. The second doctor died in questionable circumstances in India."

It was an unplanned trip, one brought on by the outbreak of coronavirus and subsequent suspension of the Bundesliga, yet it meant Sancho could celebrate his 20th birthday with his father, Sean. By then, there was plenty to discuss.

This summer was meant to provide a pivotal moment in Sancho’s career. The buzz around the boy from south London has been building ever since 2017 when he left Manchester City and the coaching methods of Pep Guardiola for Borussia Dortmund aged 17.

Almost three years later and Sancho is one of Europe’s biggest prospects — already a regular England international with 29 goals and assists in his last 21 Bundesliga appearances. It has left clubs clamouring for his services and Dortmund anticipating a bidding war when the transfer window eventually re-opens.

English football’s biggest clubs have been linked, but the impact of the global pandemic has thrown uncertainty over the outcome. The primary issue is what the economic effect will be on club finances, and what kind of budget will be left when the transfer window opens.

This has not changed Dortmund’s stance. They value Sancho at €130 million (about £115 million) and insist the price tag remains the same regardless of the impact Covid-19 has on economics.

“We said before Corona that our favourite idea is that Jadon will stay with us,” Dortmund CEO Hans-Joachim Watzke told German newspaper Bild last week. “At the end of the day you always have to respect what the player wants. I can clearly say that even the very rich clubs, despite the existential crisis, do not have to believe that they can go on a bargain tour with us. We don’t have to sell anyone under value.”

The optimistic view in Dortmund is that Sancho could remain another year, that he likes manager Lucien Favre, and is keen to build on the formidable partnership with Erling Haaland. Sancho likes his simple life in Dortmund: training and playing before returning home where a personal chef prepares meals while he plays Fifa and Fortnite online against friends back in England.

Watzke’s comments include that sentiment, but Dortmund have long been resigned to losing him. They saw this summer’s European Championship, which has now been postponed, as a stage on which Sancho could confirm, and perhaps even increase, his value. Sancho is understood to have wanted his future resolved before it began.

For a long time, the signs from Sancho have pointed towards an exit. Though Dortmund’s squad is largely English-speaking, Sancho hasn’t learnt German. He knows a few words and understands parts of the language, mostly connected to football.

But the biggest indication came last summer. Manchester United had shown a strong interest and, while both parties agreed it was not the right time to go their separate ways, Sancho did not publicly commit his future to Dortmund.

Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, the United manager, said on Tuesday that the financial consequences of the coronavirus pandemic would not affect the club’s transfer strategy.

He told Sky Sports: “Who knows how the market is going to react to this? Who knows which clubs need to sell players? There might be just a situation there where you can exploit, and I know that we at Man United are one of the biggest, and the biggest, financially well-off.”

The Sancho camp believe now is the right time to move on. Having left London for Manchester as a 15-year-old boy, then moved abroad before his 18th birthday, he is far from afraid to make bold decisions.

Manchester City have first refusal but the general consensus is that his slightly acrimonious exit three years ago makes a return unlikely. Playing in the Champions League is also a high priority to Sancho, so City’s European ban would provide another obstacle.

Sancho has developed friendships in the English game. He has bonded with Tottenham Hotspur’s Dele Alli, Leicester City’s Ben Chilwell, Marcus Rashford and Jesse Lingard, both of Manchester United. He has known Arsenal’s Reiss Nelson since they were 12-year-olds playing for Southwark district on an astroturf at Burgess Park.

Back then, Sancho was in Watford’s academy but his father would occasionally take him to watch Chelsea or Arsenal. There was no particular club he followed, instead idolising individual players. Ronaldinho was one of his favourites. During English lessons at Watford’s academy, coaches would catch Sancho watching YouTube videos of the former Barcelona forward rather than doing his work.

Childhood friends believe Sancho will return to the Premier League, but those advising him say the preferred destination is La Liga. His aim is to win the Ballon d’Or, like Ronaldinho did in 2005, and he would stand a greater chance by playing for either Real Madrid or Barcelona.

he same recommendation was recently given to Sancho’s father by lifelong family friends. That was before the coronavirus complicated matters and the world’s richest clubs were left checking their profit margins.

Barcelona were on course to become the first club to generate a revenue of €1 billion having recorded an income of €840.8 million last year. The La Liga shutdown has all but wiped out their revenue streams and the economic pressures were highlighted through a public dispute over wages. Barcelona have an annual wage bill of €300 million.

They have squandered money in the transfer market, with Antoine Griezmann the latest player to arrive for over €100 million last summer, following Ousmane Dembélé and Philippe Coutinho. Neither worked out leaving a genuine liquidity problem.

Despite the influential position he holds in Catalonia, Lionel Messi’s lobbying to re-sign Neymar last summer was unsuccessful. Sancho would be a cheaper option for Josep Maria Bartomeu, who is under pressure to land a successful major signing in his final window as Barcelona president.

Offloading Coutinho, an ongoing process, would provide Barcelona with the finances. The same can be said for Real Madrid with their attempts to remove Gareth Bale’s wages, but Kylian Mbappé remains the top target at the Bernabeu.

For now, Sancho has returned to Dortmund. He has reported for training, being completed in pairs as the club follows social distancing guidelines. The German season is slated to restart as early as May. It may prove to be the start of Sancho’s long and complicated goodbye to Dortmund."

The Coronavirus wasn't the end of him.  It was over before he started.  In 2016.  

Hillary knew this.  That's why she deigned to let him run against her.  Because, balls to walls and guns to heads, she *was* the establishment, and the establishment wasn't about to get behind some independent that preaches socialism when there are profits to be made.

(On a side note, AOC knows how her bread is buttered.  She'll be weaning herself off the socialism teat before too long because someone in the party has undoubtedly told her how things are.  And she can either enjoy a long, enriching career of not pissing people with money off, or she can go back to bartending.  Count it.)

That's the really funny thing about 2016.  Hillary figured she'd handily beat Trump in *exactly the same way she beat Sanders*.  Because she was dead certain that against the correct opponent, she could simply walk away with the win, almost as if she thought she could control *the other party*.  (But that's a different discussion about the sheer incompetence of Hillary.)

Nobody talks about how she did that to Sanders.  Or that he was either too idealistic or too naive to see it.  But one would like to think you don't survive in politics as long as he has and not know which way the wind blows.  

Maybe he thought that he had the numbers and the youth vote.  Maybe he thought with those numbers, he thought he could force the DNC to listen.  The only way that would have happened was if Bernie was courting the class of people in the country with the money, not the people who wanted the money from the people he failed to court.  

Still, I long predicted a Trump win in 2020.  I might have even done it in 2016.  I definitely predicted Sanders would never get the nod over a year ago.  I can't wait to gloat about this one."

The NCMI's mandate is to ""monitor, track, and assess a full range of global health events that could negatively impact the health of the U.S. Military and civilian populations"". 

Additionally, the article being referenced in the linked article uses the phrase ""late November"" and also uses the telling phrase ""concerns about what is now known to be the novel coronavirus pandemic"". 

Finally, it specifies the report stated ""an out-of-control disease would pose a serious threat to U.S. forces in Asia"". 

So the most likely timeline is that as people began to get sick towards the end of November, the arm of US Military Intelligence tasked specifically with medical/public health intelligence got wind of it, and reported if it spread quickly, it would present a problem to US forces in the region. 

I'd suspect there's probably a similar alert generated by the NCMI for all sorts of localized pandemics or a bad flu season that never make more than a regional impact. But, if it does get bad, or if an outbreak is identified as something exceedingly dangerous (like Ebola) the Government should ostensibly know something about the situation, rather than getting caught with their pants down.

The recent coronavirus thing and the push to label medical professionals and grocery store workers heroes has, I think, clarified it for me. 

We call people heroes when we ask them to risk their lives to deal with something we didn't plan on (and we expect them to do it for shit pay because the heroism is it's own reward of course). We say ""thank you for your service"" because it is the closest socially acceptable thing to something that is much more uncomfortable. The thing we really want to say is ""We've all failed miserably on a deep, structural level and now you have to clean it up. I'm so sorry."" In this context ""thank you"" and ""sorry"" are serving the same purpose -- acknowledging that we've all fucked up but only a small slice of the population is going to pay for it, really. But ""sorry"" is too hard, it more directly accepts the blame, so we use ""thank you"" instead. But most people can feel the shallowness of a ""thank you"" that is really a ""sorry."""

The 1.7 million death toll was a worst case scenario, was reported [by the New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/13/us/coronavirus-deaths-estimate.html?action=click&module=Spotlight&pgtype=Homepage)  about 3 weeks ago, and is a CDC projection created before it was reported likely a week or more before it was reported, and considers a scenario where no social distancing is implemented, hence worst case. 

The projection of 100-200k was made about a week ago and tried to account for current social distancing policies. [If you read the paper](http://www.healthdata.org/research-article/forecasting-covid-19-impact-hospital-bed-days-icu-days-ventilator-days-and-deaths) you will see all they did was fit to the current death counts at the time and attempt to model social distancing very loosely. They very openly acknowledged that the situation is still very uncertain and that it can go either way, and will be updated as the days go on, which it currently is. The current projection of ~60k they currently list was always a possibility in their model, just like 100k+ is still a possibility in their model within reasonable uncertainty.

[The hospital ship](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.nytimes.com/2020/04/02/nyregion/ny-coronavirus-usns-comfort.amp.html)  sent to NYC was never meant to accept coronavirus patients, leading to it having only 20 patients at the time since very few people could be confirmed to not actually have the virus and hence be allowed to enter the ship. That has now changed and last I heard it had 500/1000 beds filled. 

I’m getting too lazy to continue linking to articles for you, since it seems you don’t read them, but yes, for the most part everybody who needs a ventilator has one, thanks to creative techniques like ventilator splitting, use of cpaps and the careful shifting of ventilator supply throughout the country, not because the original ventilator capacity was never reached. 

It does seem like we are at or approaching our peak in NYC now and hopefully this trend continues. That doesn’t mean we can end the lockdowns now, since tens of thousands of cases are still being added and the virus will explode if we let up now or too soon. We also still have to wait for the rest of the country to peak and comedown, and that is going to take time. 

Finally, the death count is likely an [undercount](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.nytimes.com/2020/04/05/us/coronavirus-deaths-undercount.amp.html). This is due to a lack of testing, the fact that the virus was spreading in the country early than realized and being misdiagnosed as the flu/pneumonia since testing requirements involved international travel, and because people [are dying at home in record numbers](https://www.npr.org/sections/coronavirus-live-updates/2020/04/08/829506542/after-deaths-at-home-in-nyc-officials-plan-to-count-many-as-covid-19) and not being counted in tallies. The concrete numbers for at home deaths in nyc are around 2k, and it’s likely happening elsewhere in the nation.

Edit: I should add, the number of patients requiring [ventilators and ICU beds](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/08/nyregion/coronavirus-new-york-update.html?action=click&module=Top%20Stories&pgtype=Homepage) is still growing, but thankfully at a slower pace.

A man in Bronx, New York, was jailed for choking his long-time girlfriend, leaving her paralyzed. A plea by the accused's lawyer to get him out of jail due to coronavirus scare was rejected by the judge recently.

The accused, identified as 57-year-old, Armando Cruz, allegedly choked and paralyzed his 49-year-old girlfriend, identified as Julissa Henriquez, due to what is suspected to be an act committed out of jealousy.


On Feb.2, officers responded to an apartment shared by Cruz and Henriquez after receiving a call from the accused saying that his girlfriend was found unconscious. The responding officers found the woman lying unconscious on the floor. Cruz told the officers that he found her lying unconscious when he came out of another room.

Henriquez was rushed to the nearby Jacobi Medical Center where she gained consciousness and apparently wrote down on a paper what actually happened to her in the apartment.

An argument, goaded by Cruz’s irrational jealousy the reason for which is unclear, heated up resulting in him getting physical. He allegedly grabbed her from behind and threw her to the floor. He then sat on her back before jerking her neck backward that fractured the vertebrae in her neck damaging her windpipe.


Henriquez immediately lost consciousness. When she regained it a few moments later and tried moving out of the scene, she realized that she couldn’t move her limbs or call out for help as she was not able to talk. This made it easier for Cruz as Henriquez was unable to speak, he was able to narrate his own version of the story to the officers.

But little did he know that a neighbor who heard the couple arguing had called 911 too. Cruz was arrested on Feb. 13, 11 days after the attack, for attempted murder, assault and strangulation.

Henriquez underwent surgery to fuse her vertebrae but her long-term prognosis is not clear.

“She may never walk again,” a law enforcement source said. “That’’s how bad he hurt her.”


Cruz admitted to the assault in a videotaped statement but he bluntly denied that the injuries were his fault claiming that what he did to her was just a ""bear hug."" Cruz's bond was set at $125,000 and he was being held on Rikers Island."

Speaking on [2GB](https://www.2gb.com/scott-morrison-says-now-is-the-right-time-to-close-our-borders/) this morning, Scott Morrison said now was the right time to close the nation's borders.

 ""We were able to slow the virus' start and spread in Australia through these early periods,"" Mr Morrison said.

Mr Morrison dismissed a suggestion from host Alan Jones that China should be excluded from bidding on devalued assets, because the [coronavirus stemmed from that country](https://www.9news.com.au/world/coronavirus-update-china-containment-wuhan-slowing-the-pandemic/6834b024-0374-403c-9f3e-0c77a2fef552).

""I don't think there's any suggestion that any country, including China, has done anything deliberately,"" he said.

""This is a virus. It originated in Wuhan, China, and has gone around the world."" 

Mr Morrison defended a $715 million support package for the aviation industry not going directly to employees.

""That money is going to keep the aviation industry alive,"" he said.

""Companies are going to go through incredibly difficult times over the next six months, we're going to help them as much as we can and help them keep jobs wherever we can.""

Mr Morrison noted the $715 million package was not a cash handout but a waiver on fees.

Eva Kassens-Noor, a professor of urban planning at Michigan State University, has studied the 1918 influenza pandemic to better understand the role that population density and other geographic variables play in pandemics. 
“Rural populations have less means to contract it [coronavirus], but rural populations have less means to treat it,” Kassens-Noor says.

When it comes to other, more familiar infectious diseases, cities benefit from higher vaccination rates and the accompanying phenomenon known as “herd immunity.” 

If a large enough percentage of a population has received vaccination to an infectious disease, the community can effectively stop its transmission to vulnerable people or those who didn’t get the shot.

Smaller cities can also suffer more acutely from infectious disease than big ones, at least when it comes to the flu. A 2018 paper published in Science, co-authored by Dalziel and Viboud, found that mid-sized metropolitan areas such as Nashville tend to experience shorter and more intense outbreaks of influenza relative to big cities such as New York or Miami. Larger urban populations, the researchers found, provide a greater degree of herd immunity, slowing the spread of the disease through the community and counteracting the role that humidity plays in the spread of flu. Larger urban hospitals also tend to be more capable of handling an influx of sick people."

> When our bodies been fighting germs, bacteria and viruses all our life?

Yup. Immunology and virology explain a lot of things about this new disease. Science, it works!

For example, it's spreading quickly because it's new - nobody had immunity until recently. Some people are affected more or less strongly because the immune system mutates very quickly and create a massive amount of biodiversity.

Chronic health problems are related to survival because they have a huge impact on how much reserve functional capacity people have available when some cells become infected and must be destroyed. Chronic health also has a huge impact on the immune system.

Virology explains why this virus is really good at propagating through snot-drops but less able to contaminate surface water. (Even though other viruses like polio are *incredibly* good at that.)"

As a simplified example, the worst case would be a test that picked up 70% of antibodies for *any* coronavirus rather than just covid-19. The specificity is garbage and the results are dependent on an unknown (or at least unstated) ecosystem of circulating viruses compared to your target.

All that said, when you look at published sensitivity and specificity rates for other covid-19 antibody tests it *feels* like the 70% number offered is an attempt to collapse the effect of both sensitivity and specificity into a single figure, or the SSI test is substantially less sensitive than its competitors which might hint at a higher specificity if anything.

I mean that’s a gathering of info for it. Now sure it’s a reddit comment, and if it was just a comment it would have to be discounted for sure. However, each statement is backed up by its own article.

Also, attacking with “fake news” is absolutely meaningless. Considering the vast amount of time it takes to check basically any of trumps statements is exhausting. Just look at the absolutely large amount of lies he’s told SIMPLY about the coronavirus? He’s a president, not a doctor, yet he was claiming and pulling “facts” out of thin air. This isn’t any echo chamber type deal. LOOK at anything he said, HE SAID, leading into this ordeal. Look at what any professional was saying at the time. Not only would they be the opposite, whatever trump said ended up not coming true. It’s been a farce.

The conservative echo chamber is so vast, and so intense, the fact you may not even begin to believe it shows it’s power. The fact that you dare state “fake news” shows how entwined you are. Any thing that’s stated that you do not believe is fake news. Anything that doesn’t share your view point is fake news. That’s not fake, that’s you unwilling to admit you’re wrong.

How the fuck do I know that? Because people like you will call me stupid, or retarded, or listening to an echo chamber. The reality? I WAS in an echo chamber. I fucking came into this presidency with a vote for trump. I yelled for Hillary’s emails, and trump had important policies I stood for. I watched as every promise he made disappear, the reasons I voted went unnoticed. The policies he stated, all lies. The subreddits and news sources, all state so horrifically how he’s basically never wrong. I KNEW he was wrong, the reasons why I voted were never brought up again. The promises he’s made were broken. Here he stands making a fucking mockery of the presidency, and some people can do nothing but support him. As people die left and right, and as they hoard supplies and lie and lie and lie, Americans die for no good reason other than greed. Is an American dying due to no fault of their own, due to the government really, their fault? Does this just strengthen your view of how great trump is as people die? Is that just blind patriotism? Is that the inability to think rationally? Is that the inability to admit you were wrong?

While I do rash on democratic media’s misenterpreting sources, because I am not a blind follower of them, it is dwarfed by conservative disinformation. The idea of FELLOW AMERICANS with slightly differing opinions being enemies, is so antithetical to the idea of being an American. 

Be a true American, be a patriot, and realize we all have different opinions, but we’re still AMERICANS. SUPPORT the idea of differing thought, and don’t blindly follow, accept fault for where you lie at times, and accept victory as to where you win. But you are not a winner right now, none of us are, as Americans."

For example: 

Say you got Chickenpox as a child. If we test your antibodies to varicella (which is the virus that causes chickenpox) it would be positive, and we usually quantify how many antibodies there are to ensure they are sufficient to say you now have immunity to varicella. 

Similarly, if you're younger and had the varicella vaccine which came out more recently, then you recieved an attenuated version of the virus in the vaccine (since the varicella vaccine is a live vaccine), which would result in a similar immune reaction and antibody formation. Doing a serology test for antibodies  would effectively show the same antibodies and levels to suggest immunity. 

So you would have to have gotten ""infected"" by coronavirus to get immunity. Simply getting exposed would not be sufficient. 

To answer the other part of your question about symptoms. I'm no immunologist but my understanding is that it shouldn't matter if you had symptoms or not, as long as you had a sufficient immune reaction to generate antibodies. However, I haven't seen many studies yet about antibody testing in Covid to know if people can generate antibodies with asymptomatic confirmed cases. Mild symptoms would likely be sufficient, but I haven't seen the studies yet, so can't say for sure. 

Hope that made sense."
