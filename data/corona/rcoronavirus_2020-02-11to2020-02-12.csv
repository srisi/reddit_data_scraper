2020-02-11,baconn,Coronavirus,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/f2hm3b/harvard_expert_says_coronavirus_likely_now/fhcn7zb/,">Unfortunately, I think it’s more likely to be that it’s gathering steam. We’ve released a preprint that we’ve been discussing publicly — and trying to get peer reviewed in the meantime — that looks at the numbers internationally, based on how many cases you would expect from normal travel volumes. And a couple of things are striking. One is that there are countries that really should be finding cases and haven’t yet, like Indonesia and maybe Cambodia. They are outside the range of uncertainty you would expect even given variability between countries. So our best guess is that there are undetected cases in those countries. Indonesia said a couple of days ago that it had done 50 tests, but it has a lot of air travel with Wuhan, let alone the rest of China. So 50 tests is not enough to be confident you’re catching all the cases. That’s one bit of evidence that to me was really striking. Second, I was reading The Wall Street Journal that Singapore had three cases so far that were not traced to any other case. Singapore is the opposite of Indonesia, in that they have more cases than you would expect based on their travel volume, probably because they’re better at detection. And even they are finding cases that they don’t have a source for. That makes me think that many other places do as well. Of course, we’re making guesses from limited information, but I think they’re pretty likely to be correct guesses, given the totality of information.  
>  
>**There’s likely to be a period of widespread transmission in the U.S**., and I hope we will avert the kind of chaos that some other places are seeing. That’s likely if we continue to be prepared, but I think it’s going to be a new virus that we have to deal with. That won’t be because the United States government has failed to contain it, it will mean that this is an uncontainable virus. If we’re dealing with it, it’s because everybody’s going to be dealing with it. I think that’s a likely scenario.  
>  
>The evidence from other coronaviruses is that there is some immunity but it doesn’t last for long. Immunity to the seasonal coronaviruses lasts for maybe a couple of years, and then you can get reinfected. There’s a further question of whether that’s because the virus is changing or because your immunity is not very durable. Given that it’s a new virus, we can’t say anything with certainty, but it would be reasonable to expect immunity to be somewhat short-lived, meaning a couple of years, rather than lifelong."

For food, if it's less than about 3 months, the easiest thing to do is to just create a short term food store.  Basically move 3 months worth of the grocery store to your location, simple as that.  If you eat a can of chunky soup per week ... get 3 months supply.  If you eat a bag of chips a week, get 3 months supply.  Do that for everything you eat that will store well (obviously not milk, etc ..) and store it.  Then you ""shop"" at your own ""store"" and use the things with the closest expiration date, then go ""resupply"" at the ""grocery store"" and replenish your supplies, rotating in things with the longest expiration dates to the back of the store so they get used last.  Doing this you don't really change anything, and all you are investing in is some record keeping, space to store this food, and the money it takes to purchase 3 months of stores.  You do need to differentiate the food so that you don't treat your food store like an extended pantry .. i.e., don't raid it for chips until it's time to go ""shopping"", don't just wander into your own store and eat stuff from it ... pretend it's an actual store and that you can only shop there as necessary.  It might even be a good idea to lock the food up if you have teens who are raiding it."

Lots of executives make a lot of money (executives in hospitals, health insurance companies, and pharmaceutical companies). There’s lots of studies about how hospitals in the US just keep adding more administrators in healthcare ( https://www.beckershospitalreview.com/hospital-physician-relationships/growth-of-healthcare-administrators-outpaced-physicians-increasing-3-200-between-1975-2010.html ). These administrators don’t touch patients, but they make on average 98,000$ (I’m a nurse, work nights and weekends and I’m the one on the frontlines, actually caring for patients: working holidays, nights, being exposed to germs, being abused by patients and families, etc and last year before taxes I made 52,000$). The excessive spending in healthcare is because hospitals and health insurance companies keep making up administrators jobs that demand high salaries. Part of it is because for hospitals to be fully reimbursed by Medicare and Medicaid, we have to have super high satisfaction surveys, low readmission rates, etc - so lots of people are getting paid a lot of money to sit in offices and do things like come up with scripts for how we should talk to patients so if they get a satisfaction survey they will rate us high. The whole system is fucked up with patients and healthcare providers being screwed over"

We have estimates, and epidemiologists have been saying that the conditions in China are likely causing the virus to decline in terms of R0 and will likely peak soon. Its *insanely* difficult for a virus to spread with the way Chinese cities are now. 

This doesn't mean that this is over. It still can go through large cluster outbreaks in cities across the world over the next few months. 100% containment is just not realistic, but mass mitigation (going into lockdown when community transmission becomes a bigger issue) is going to be the difference between this infected 500k people worldwide, infecting 3 million worldwide, and infecting 3 billion worldwide. Its not a pipe dream that this doesn't become a truly global massive pandemic, its realistic. We are insanely good at mitigation and containment in the modern world. I know people here seemingly want this virus to spread globally for some weird reason, but that isn't likely."

A couple of them focused on hospitalized patients that, of course, will have a higher mortality because they are more serious.  There are others that put the overall rate of death at around 2% total in China so far with roughly double the rate of the flu outside of China.

But it doesn't really matter whether we accept 2% or 5%.  We don't have to guess at how to prepare.  We have a living example right now - Wuhan.

And the model for preparedness there is stock up on food and be prepared for quarantine.  Not shave your head into a mohawk, spray paint your face, and mount a chain gun to a dune buggy.  Nor is it going camping.

I think this has the potential to be very serious and disruptive.  But world ending it isn't."

First of all, given his 10,000 person small town example, he first is assuming that the whole town gets sick. 

There are currently 33,366 cases in the entire Hubei province (although many of those likely lie in Wuhan, for sure). The total population of Hubei is 58.5 million people. 33,366/58,500,000 is around a 0.05% infection rate. In a 10,000 person town, if we take 10,000 * 0.05, we can conclude that 5 people would be infected, assuming it scales down perfectly. And even then, only 11.3% of that number would designate serious cases (that's not even a full person). 

Let's play devil's advocate and assume every Hubei case is within Wuhan. Wuhan has a population of 11.08 million. 33,366/11,080,000 gives us an 0.3% infection rate, a decent amount higher. Even so, in a 10,000 person town, 10,000 * 0.3% = 30 people. If we multiply 30 * 11.3%, we can conclude that only 3 patients would require hospitalization."

It’s the fact that I feel like our own governments seem to downplay this while they hide the information ball that has me raddled.  If this were *just* a Chinese problem, I think our governments would be far more transparent, not a 100% transparent (they’d still have to let China save face), but they’d be much more so.

Could be something completely unrelated to the virus. Heart attack/stroke/seizure etc

Could be people who are sick but just fainting (e.g. due to hypoxia/low blood pressure) not necessarily “dropping dead”. Syncope (fainting) can look a lot like a seizure sometimes, it can even come with clonic movements i.e. “twitching”. See this video for example... https://youtu.be/DOHGXoiS_Dk

I’ve read that the virus has been demonstrated to sometimes lead to end organ failure e.g. heart failure. Not exactly sure on what the mechanism of injury is, I’ve yet to read up on it. But imo people who suffer from these complications are probably extremely unwell, far too sick to be up and walking around in public."

1. Having to stay in your house,
2. Having to leave your house with puppy,
3. Having to leave your house without puppy.

In the first, you will need food, medication, toys (enrichment) and toilet options for the pup (including bin bags, and disinfectant).

If you may have to leave with pup then you should consider getting a crate and crate training. Having a crate is the only way you might possibly be allowed to have the pup in a quarantine or other evacuation facility and the easiest way to control the pup in another location. Also the safest way to travel with a pup in a car.  You’ll also need travel gear for pup, water bowl, food bowl, cleaning supplies, weather protection, first aid, medication etc.

If you have to leave without pup then there’s not much you can do. Best idea is to hide a key somewhere and let a few trusted people know where. That way they can get in and look after pup if they can. You could also prepare by sending pup to a kennel or friend in the country if things start to look bad, but not everyone can do that."

But that much is true. The source being bat soup is purely because of social media. The fucking sign there is plainly from an Indonesian establishment in Palau.

Was the virus associated with bats? Maybe. There is a lot of similarity and many experts say there was another animal between the bat reservoir and the human that allowed the virus to jump species. Others say it's from pangolins. It's still not certain.

But the soup in the video was not the source. If anything, the wet markets are much more likely to be connected. That soup was not served in the wet markets in question. Furthermore, viruses do not typically handle heat very well, and they don't cause illness the same way after cooking if they do not withstand the heat the same way bacteria do (due to toxic by products of bacterial metabolism). And if the bat soup caused the virus to jump species, the initial outbreak would have been in Indonesia, but it wasn't.

I despise the CCP for constantly threatening my independent country and my people but this isn't even a rational attempt to explain the virus. Social media is fairly useful for getting a citizen's eye view of stuff being censored by China, but there's also a lot of dumb crap going around."

Primary secondary and tertiary carries will not even show symptoms or know the are ill whilst infecting others. 
It is aerosolized, that means it is carried in the air, not just by droplet and surface contamination so it cannot be quarantined effectively. It is very resilient outside the body. The vectors for contamination are too many and there is no present vaccine or treatment. 
Currently it is estimated there are dozens of not hundreds of undetected cases in the UK. These people are all infecting 2 or 3 other people.
So if it’s already here, you can’t see it and you don’t know it’s there how do you stop it?

What do you think will happen when next week 16 people are sick, then 32, then 64, then in a few weeks tens thousands? 

Most will be fine, but because of the sheer numbers infected, the numbers of severe cases will overwhelm health facilities. People who could be treated with O2 or steroids will not get a bed. Staff will get ill. 
Some people will get ill and not go to work. Some will panic and stay inside. Transport will stop, deliveries will stop, there will be shortages. 

Containment has already failed. We should be looking at what to do. How to provide oxygen, beds and other treatments to as many as possible and to re-enforce infrastructure and stop any panic by informing the public. 

If all the facts about the germ are true, then how am I wrong? Just because this isn’t in the newspapers doesn’t mean it won’t happen. Use your A in maths. It is inevitable. What do you think ‘serious and imminent danger to health’ means?
Why do you think hundreds of thousands are already sick and tens of thousands see dead in China? We are 36 days behind them. It is very easy to see what is really happening there on this sub. 

Now if it makes you feel better call me a conspiracy theorist but this is already happening. Do fuck all if you want, but I’m getting ready."

But legal ownership of firearms is not an option in many liberal states and especially larger liberal cities (NYC for example).  Ordinary people in these areas are already effectively denied 2a rights due to permitting restrictions and red tape.  Unless one has connections, good luck obtaining a legal permit.  In addition, it is worth mentioning that the penalties for folks that illegally own firearms in these same areas are very high - jail time almost guaranteed.  Therefore, essentially only criminals own firearms in these areas.  Great legislation, indeed.  But this is not about 2a.  My point is that while what you state will hold true for states such as Texas, the overall population in many areas of the country is powerless in the event of a mass quarantine.  The deterrent of the militia is not present throughout much of America and the fed govt can basically do whatever they want.

One information suggestion and a couple quick accessibility suggestions, *depending on the capabilities of the backend*:

Can you add a standard seasonal flu as a 4th set of data? Is there a good dataset?

Can you use colors other than red & green, since some folks are r/g colorblind? Maybe blue, yellow, red? The shape markers help with this already.

Is it possible to trick the x-scale to go in weekly increments of days instead of auto-chosen numbers of days? For instance, a couple days ago for me the bottom of the 45-day graphs showed up in 8-day increments, and the 100-day in 16-day...which was hilariously personally irritating as a human who uses 7-day weeks.... So it could still count in days, but go by 7s & 14s?

Ok, I know the graph would be large, but to my students having a version of the two non-log graphs (fatalities vs infections) graphed on top of each other but on the same y-scale would be a good visualization. Right now when graphed as non-log (simpler for the math-phobic) it looks like more people died than were infected unless you additionally realize how to look at the two y-scales. It would just help me give them a more comfortable point of entry, because then I could explain the scale-overlapping graph after.

Can you put your name/contact info/qualifications (whatever you're comfortable with) on the bottom so people know who they're trusting to chart the data?

You asked for suggestions, those are mine. You don't have to take any of them, of course. :)"

I posted in this thread to reduce panic because people are eating this shit up.

&#x200B;

I'll say from my own first-hand experience though in China - it is scary. It is something to be afraid of and it is something people need to take seriously, people snickered and laughed when I was passed border patrol in New York because I was wearing a mask not knowing I just arrived from China - the same occurred when I went to Delta airlines in Terminal 2 for my connecting flight and when I landed in Tampa. People don't give a shit when they should and people laugh when they realize people wearing a mask could potentially be saving their life, or saving their parents life (it effects the elderly the worst) if they contract it and shake it off as the traditional flu. People aren't taking precaution when they should be, it's serious.

&#x200B;

People should be concerned and talking about, you should be taking in as much media as you can about it, you should know what's going on and whether or not it's going to effect you. The more informed you are the better, and if you fear it, then there's absolutely nothing wrong with that - you should fear it, it can kill you. I was on vacation in a ghost town which was in Jilin province for three weeks, I know first-hand what China is like right now, and let me tell you if it gets spread through America - we're fucked. No one wears masks here, no one cares and most of us won't give a shit until it truly effects us or someone in their lives. 

&#x200B;

The people who don't take this as important are the very same ones who think it can never happen to them, or they don't preventative measures, they only take action when it actually hits them. So yes, it **is as bad as this sub** paints it to be, take most of what you see with a grain of salt of course, ingest media, outline what you see and develop your own informed opinion. Some people spread misinformation and fear-mongering videos like the ones I posted without fact-checking - which is something this sub needs - a sticky at the top and more moderation to prevent fear-mongering videos, and when something is fact-checked we can then post it and have discussions being made regarding it. Right now it's an influx of misinformation and people who just want to benefit off the virus on Youtube/Social media. 

&#x200B;

But to note - The videos you see in China, I'd take those seriously. Except ones posted from a reliable source, ones that haven't been vetted. People can easily fabricate and doctor videos with fake speakers and people will do anything to make China look bad (I mean, we know it's bad and they're underreporting, and a lot is wrong that they're doing) so expect a lot of bullshit to come out, but most of those videos are more than real. It's real, it's scary."

Reports show China’s internet usage has dropped to 0 meaning the only info getting out is what the CCP puts out. For some reason Chinese authorities needed to kill a lot of people in Wuhan. Maybe there was evidence of a major coup organizing there with a lot of supporters. A modified version of SARS is released and allowed to fester. When the world finds out about it countries race to pull out their citizens (including foreign intelligence agents posing as workers). When the non Chinese citizens are out China can have free reign to kill everyone involved with the planned coup and blame it on the virus. As a bonus the Chinese gov’t will look like a hero to the rest of the country for stopping this from spreading outside Hubei Provence. 

China knows the world expects them to lie about the # of infected and dead, so they do. China knows the world expects there to be “insider” videos posted that shows the virus is worse than what is being reported, so they create them. The Chinese gov’t knows the protests in Hong Kong can spread like a wildfire across China and they are willing to do whatever it takes to make sure that doesn’t happen.

However that would be bad as I’m guessing they would have spread it around the prison a lot. Also come into close contact with arresting Police Officer and who knows before arrest.

If it’s positive then basically along with the cases in Brighton it’s certainly going to be spreading around the UK.

At what point will UK Gov declare a serious emergency and impose emergency measures on public gatherings, sporting events and non essential travel. Possibly in the next week or so. I would stock up now in this window of opportunity.

However also chance with good surveillance they track down a lot of cases and manage to slow the spread or possibly contain it. I’m not sure what capacity UK has to handle tracking down contacts of multiple cases. At some point that system will get swamped and they will switch to ramping up general public health advice and preparing more emergency centres."

But, everytime I go to a store, I pick up a multi-pack of ramen, or first aid, or masks, or sanitizer, or water.  The point being that I'm not prepping, I'm just buying things I need or will shortly need.  Yeah, my wife gives me some shit about why I need macaroni or rice or beans, but it's not too bad because I don't buy a ton at a time.

I'm old enough that if the earlier statistics are valid, I don't have that great of a chance of getting through it.  But, if I don't, my kids will have the benefit of me starting supplying in late January.  And that is pretty much the point.

Will that be enough?
Probably not.

And that's where you have to get your head straight about this.  It's a virus.  It doesn't choose who to infect.  It doesn't choose which country should be impacted.  One world, we make it together, or not.

But still. We've been around these domesticated animals for thousands of years and we've already shared viruses and diseases (such as small pox). 
Within a homestead, it's just not possible to isolate yourself like this. Basically your stock is part of your extended family. I can't imagine trying to have animals, or to farm, and keeping that kind of separation. So avoiding their viruses is probably impossible (as we see the regular exchange of flu viruses especially in Chinese farming systems). Keeping in close contact with the soil and the good bacteria in ruminant dung has protective properties, they can outcompete harmful bacteria. 
Here in NZ we have no harmful diseases associated with dogs, we eradicated hydatids, we have no lyme disease. We have brucellosis, so that's potentially a risk you take if you want to have your own raw milk etc. but you can get your stock tested and keep a closed brucellosis-free flock. The biggest health risk would be leptospirosis here. If you work with livestock, you will get pissed on sooner or later... But you can vaccinate stock anyway. Lepto can be transmitted by any mammal. 
Toxo is everywhere, I'm sure I've had it since I was a kid because it's everywhere there are cats, it's on every farm. A lot of countries encourage little girls to play with cats so they get toxo when they're kids and not when they're pregnant. 
But you're right, to avoid all germs, we'd have to apply these controls to every part of our lives and eat food grown in lab and not have animal companions. No for me, thanks."

considering there is a lot of droplets on those possible areas where they are treating the patients, that it cause so many droplets in the air could it be caused by that to lead them to say it's airborne? there was no information about this.

Chinese health authorities clarified on Sunday that the transmission routes of the novel coronavirus via aerosol and oral-fecal are yet to be verified, reiterating that the main routes of the virus infection remain transmission via contact and direct transmission such as transmission via respiratory droplets.

The clarification was made public in a Sunday article posted by the National Health Commission (NHC) on its official Sina Weibo account after Zeng Qun, deputy head of the Shanghai Civil Affairs Bureau, said at a Saturday press conference that the novel coronavirus can transmit via aerosol. 

In the Sunday post, the NHC clarified that the aerosol transmission refers to the nucleus composed of proteins and pathogens that came out from the droplets upon evaporation, which further float in the air in the form of aerosol, possibly causing long-distance transport.

The NHC also said that normally, there would not be any novel coronavirus in the air if sufficiently ventilated, and also suggested that the public should open their windows at least twice a day as an effective measure to lower the chance of infection.  

However, without enough ventilation, for example in narrow spaces such as the inside of a car or office, aerosol transmission should be also considered, said Yao Maosheng, a bioaerosol study expert and professor from the College of Environmental Sciences and Engineering of the Peking University in Beijing. 

Yao told the Global Times on Sunday that even breathing in viruses does not necessarily mean that one would surely get infected, as it would be determined by factors such as the number of live virus and the virus's own infection characteristics. 

The NHC stressed that the transmission of the virus via aerosol can only take place under certain conditions, such as in the professional medical operation process of tracheal intubation. It added that wearing masks in the correct way is one of the best measures to prevent ordinary people from getting infected by the virus. (Presuming n95 or rubber seal masks)

In open spaces, the chance of getting infected can be almost negligible, if not closely surrounded by an infected patient, Yao said, when asked to comment on the possibility of infection through aerosol transmission.

2020-02-11,bremidon,Coronavirus,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/f1pc28/made_the_mistake_of_telling_family_and_colleagues/fhagcnb/,"I'm in Germany, and I'm getting the same line here.  I have to keep reminding people that you can't compare the end of one wave with the beginning of another.  

Then mention that the rate is probably around 2% (I think that number is an ass-pull that is most likely on the low side, but that's just a feeling.  I'll go with the consensus number for now).  That's usually met with, ""Oh, see, that's not so bad.""  Leaving aside just how horrifying having 1 in 50 people die from this thing is, and how it can be waved away, I then mention that this is comparable to the 1918 flu that killed 50 million to 100 million.

Most usually make an ""Ohhh"" face at this point, but the die-hards then try the tack that we are so much further along now in medicine, and it couldn't possibly happen again.  This usually opens up a discussion about how we are \*not\* really able to do much more now then back in 1918.  It's a virus.  Until we have an effective vaccination, we are basically fighting the symptoms, just like in 1918.  Keep 'em hydrated and try to let the body do its thing.

The final nail is asking: if this is not so dangerous, why is China literally tanking its economy in order to fight it with some of the most extreme measures possible?  The government is staking its entire future on their response, and while the Chinese government is ruthless, they are not dumb.  They have made the decision that they would rather deal with unrest caused by locking cities down rather than chance it with the virus.  This is usually the point where the last holdouts throw in the towel.  

So keep cool, take precautions, prepare reasonably.  The most likely outcome is that this will be contained and will be another near-miss.  Being prepared for the less likely but more extreme outcome is still absolutely reasonable."
