What you should understand is that they are mostly 2nd/3rd generation Chinese immigrants in America. That's said, they might be from ethnic Chinese origins, but never part of our Chinese culture/community, the most connections they have with China is the 3 weeks holiday years ago. They romanticized life in China and will defend their dreams because it's suppose to be a ""safe harbour"" for their mind in this crucial world.

But the irony is, since they're not willing to learn a single bit of Chinese language (that's part of the reasons why I despite them), they won't realise that if their beloved China really dominated world in the ultranationalism manner that they are dreaming about, these r/sino members will be on the top of the nationalist death list because they will be seen as ""betrayers of the country and culture"". Chinese nationalist has a term for them, 香蕉人(""banana people""), because they appear to be ""yellow Chinese"" but in the inside are still a ""white devil"", this will be seen as crime even worse that other ""regular whites"".

One of my favourite quote on this topic comes from Carlo Ginzburg, he proposed the notion that being ashamed of one’s country, not love of it, may be the true mark of belonging to it.

Feb. 7, 2020, 7:10 p.m. ET
One patient, admitted to a hospital in Wuhan, China, infected at least 10 health care workers and four other patients with the coronavirus that has sickened more than 31,000 people, killed 600 and reached two dozen other countries.

The case was just one disturbing detail in a new report on 138 patients in Wuhan that helps explain how the illness progresses and how it spreads.

The report, one of two published on Friday by JAMA, is among the most comprehensive articles to date about people infected with the newly identified virus.

The patients ranged in age from 22 to 92, with a median of 56 years, and were admitted to Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University from Jan. 1 to Jan 28. Many of them — 41 percent — were presumed to have caught the virus in the hospital, including 17 people who had been admitted for other illnesses, and 40 health care workers.

The patient who infected so many health workers had been placed in a surgical ward because of abdominal symptoms, and the coronavirus was not initially suspected. Four other patients in that ward also contracted the disease, presumably from the first patient.

The incident was a chilling reminder of the “super-spreaders” in outbreaks of other coronavirus diseases, SARS and MERS — patients who infected huge numbers of other people, sometimes dozens. The phenomenon is poorly understood and unpredictable, an epidemiologist’s nightmare. Super-spreaders led to considerable transmission of MERS and SARS inside hospitals.

Reporting on Friday in JAMA, the authors said their data suggested that rapid person-to-person spread of the virus had occurred among their cases. That was in part because of patients like the one admitted to the surgical department, whose symptoms misled doctors into suspecting other illnesses and failing to take precautions to prevent spread of the virus until it was too late.

About 10 percent of the patients did not initially have the usual symptoms, cough and fever, but instead had diarrhea and nausea first. Other uncommon symptoms included headache, dizziness and abdominal pain.

Another cause for concern was that some patients who at first appeared mildly or moderately ill then took a turn for the worse several days or even a week into their illness. The median time from their first symptoms to when they became short of breath was five days; to hospitalization, seven days; and to severe breathing trouble, eight days. Experts say that pattern means patients must be carefully monitored, and it is not safe to assume that someone who seems to be doing well early on is out of the woods.

The finding is a “heads up” to doctors to keep an eye on these patients, Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said in a recorded interview posted by JAMA.

Like previous reports on coronavirus patients, this one found that older people and those with underlying health problems like diabetes, heart disease or cancer tended to become more severely ill than younger, healthier patients.

Over all, about 26 percent of the 138 patients needed intensive care; their median age was 66, compared with a median of 51 years for those who did not require intensive care.

For this series of patients, the death rate was 4.3 percent, which is higher than the estimates coming from other parts of China. The reason is not known, and the figures may change as more information is gathered."

We use sugarical masks for inpatients who may have infectious disease, and we use surgical masks (non-n95) to walk into some isolation rooms. 

If it was a waste of time and money, why would hospitals  make the investments of it was useless??

and it is mandatory to show our safety infection control to Local and state boards. They’re are policy and procedure to require surgical masks for reverse isolation, and to help decrease nosocomial infections. 

Otherwise you probably would be seeing super understaffed hospitals and clinics because everyone would be catching the flu! It’s not mandatory but it’s best to wear these masks in urgent care clinics and ER waiting rooms. 

The first thing learned in any allied health or med school program is to treat every patient that walks in the door as if they have something infectious already.

Once it gets out just a little, it’s just enough to infect a few people at a time and then they infect a few more at a time. 

In one of the posts on this sub someone was talking about an employee who came in from Wuhan just showing up to work like normal. No self quarantine, nothing. Gaining entry around the building requires palm scans... I believe the person said over 300 employees are in the building. So theoretically, he could have been touching his face (possibly with the virus) then the scan device and bam- he’s exposed a lot of people. Assuming he thought since he didn’t have symptoms he was fine. 

From what I gather, those on the quarantined ships feel the same. I just saw in the news cases on one of the ships doubled overnight. 


We can expect people to quarantine themselves.. 
But it’s likely there would be at least a handful of people who will go out anyway. We see those people all the time. Won’t stay home with a stomach virus, much less the flu. 

Then demanding jobs that will fire someone for missing two full weeks. I worked for ATT and watched them fire people for needing to attend a family members funeral service. There are a lot of companies just like that, at least in the states. So there are going to be people who still go to work. Many assuming they have a winter cold and just push through."

Thats for a healthy person. Peak death rate for viral Pneumonia is 1-2 weeks after ARDS develops, but 1/3rd die 30-90 days after admission.
Incubation period 2-10 days
Development of pneumonia and hospital admission 7 days after initial symptoms 
Development of ARDS 10 days after initial symptoms 
Death 66% cases 15-40 days after initial symptoms
Death 33% cases 40-100 days after initial symptoms

The long lag between symptoms and death is why trying to calculate fatality rates is so difficult. Of the first 41 patients 65% had survived, 15% had died and 20% were still in hospital. So death rates in the elderly (60+) could be 20-30% compared to 50% with SARS. So we could be looking at a 5% mortality rate virus down the track. Its just too early to know."

The virus development was paid for by the US department of defense at harvard.   the vaccine was stolen by the doctorate mentioned in the first link.  

Russia is blaming the US because they know this.  See link 4.  India is launching a probe into Wuhan’s virus lab.  See link 2.  Also, a reputable link from a mainstream publication, see link 3.

China is developing propaganda saying the weapon was developed in the US.  They’re not wrong.  

Still, 2019-nCov being released into the public is an accident.

The lab uses bats for virus studies.  Most likely a lab employee unintentionally carried a the virus out of the lab.   The media is leaving out the bioweapon detail at this time, because we have no cure, not enough tests, and nothing can be done until the country begins to see symptoms in the public.  

The FBI is disclosing Chinese espionage investigations this Tuesday.  See link 1.

Also, it’s true, blame is not as important right now as scientific research for the purpose of solving this problem.   Premature disclosure could potentially create hysteria and subsequent consequences.

We live in the uk. We have free healthcare. We are an island.

Yes, we are densely populated, but not on the same scale as China or India. Our standard of living is high, we have clean streets and hygienic systems of irrigation.

Posted in another thread, but:
January 24th was the first time China reported more than 1000 confirmed cases. That means most of the 17,000 cases are 2 weeks old or less. Given that, it's not surprising only 2% of the cases have resulted in death so far. Keep in mind that there are currently 4k cases listed as serious or Critial (800 of the 4k) in Hubei province right now.

From doctor reports we're seen, symptoms get progressively worse for 2 weeks, and then the 3rd week determines if the person's immune system will fight off the virus or if they'll succumb to it. It's a bit early to make these sorts of announcements unless your goal is to just quell panic."

Depending on how long the factories are shut down this could be a horrible situation for our industry. Already being told some dresses may not arrive in time for weddings. This may not seem like a big deal to most people but for our industry this will have a huge impact. Supposedly the factories are to reopen on Feb 10th but my guess is they will have a difficult time getting workers to show up. It’s really a cluster."

I am afraid we are going to start seeing sick people in a week or two.  I've seen a number of people talking about how they know people who came back, had no quarantine, and were walking around in public without a care in the world.  There was one in the /r/AskDocs sub...guy and his family hung out with a guy and found out he just got back from China. I've read about a few people in Florida as well and now New Jersey.

I want to apologize for my Country´s pitiful non-existant attempt to screen anyone arriving to the country atm 

been following 2019-nCoV since it began and I´m really worried not because Mexico´s health system, I´m worried because of the ignorant people saying ""its nothing, just a flu, whatever"" and quickly spreading the disease. 

A week ago, a Chinese person from Wuhan came to CDMX (Mexico´s most populated city) and had a tour for TWO whole days, what´s the matter with that?   


He was diagnosed positive for 2019-nCoV in the US...   


He traveled asymptomatic, ate tacos in CDMX center, used 2 Ubers (1 from the airport to the hotel / 1 from the hotel to the airport ) those two Uber drivers had 240 travels after having direct contact with that chinese.. what did happen?   
Uber disabled 242 accounts... yay... 

There´s a real chance by the next week, Mexico might start to have a bump in confirmed cases   


My personal recommendation: Do not travel to Mexico, for your own safety, imho, we are pretty much against the clock.

People here won´t believe until they begin to agonize... its our culture

Cheers and good luck"

N95 is a classification by the NIOSH (National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health).The N is a classification indicator that it is not resistant to petroleum (doesn't matter in our use case) and the 95 is the percentage of filtered particles. You can also find so called N100 respirators and filters, but they are much more expensive.

The Europe system follows the European norm EN 149 for respirators and classifies them via as FFP1 to FFP3. While FFP just stands for ""filtering face piece"" and the number indicates the 3 levels of sealing and filtering ability.FFP3 is considered to provide a very good seal with at max. 5% leakage (average at 2%). It is supposed to filter at least 99% of toxic substances, as well as droplet aerosols, cancer and radioactive substances, enzymes, microorganisms (viruses, germs, fungi and spores) and other dangerous substances, which concentration can reach up to 30x the allowed concentration at your work place.

So get some FFP3 masks they have higher filtering abilities as N95 respirators,Yet the best mask is to not touch your face.

Your list so far is decent. I'd add some disinfecting laundry detergent to the mix. Also maybe a pack of latex gloves. Make sure that your home medicine cabinet is fully stocked and that you have a supply of high energy canned food to survive a few days, if sh\*t really hits the fan.  


edit:  
Throw in some (hand)lotion, because sanitizing your skin can be really harsh.  
Also stock up on some small sanitizer bottles for on the go and spray bottles for IPA 70 (a mix of 70% isopropanol and 30% water).

The couple from Chicago that had the virus were just released from the hospital where they were in quarantine. Noted to be in good condition. China is a different country with a different quality of life. I did a study abroad. Had my own private Chinese security team follow me around and control what I could and could not say. If I wanted to use a toilet I had plan my route accordingly and stop at hotels. At the time, especially outside of the city there were areas without modern day sewage systems though they did have ditches.... What I'm getting at is that when you get out of China disease in general is different because there is an established infrastructure to treat symptoms. Not necessarily treat the disease but treat the parts of it that kill. So if you have pneumonia we can treat the fluid in your lungs with antibiotics and then give you a steroid to open lung capacity. If need be we can put you on a machine until you recover. A lot of those people in China don't have those options. If there are other outbreaks. You'll see it in places like the outskirts of North Korea, Africa, India, Columbia, Venezuela, and Bolivia. Places with really bad infrastructure."

The goggles have to be fog proof, seal to your face with no gaps. Unless your equipment live up to that they wont protect you as you wish.

Also id recommend you to buy UVC water cleanser or a portable carbon fiber filter. Add Xinix aquacare to your list as well and some nitrile gloves. This might be overkill but a protective suit against biological danger with taped seams could also be a good idea if SHTF.

The most essential is water and food. Buy bottles for at least 2 weeks (mineral water lasts for months if they aren’t opened and put somewhere dark). 15 bottles per person or so. And make sure you can seal the ventilation in your home. Duck tape and towels would do the job."

In the first place it's a complete false equivalency as the Flu is overwhelmingly essentially dying of natural causes and old age or some other disease.

Ironically China records deaths more accurately concerning this. Find the number of people who die from flu or pneuomnia and who are not elderly - who are not over 80 or over 70 and unhealthy - who do not have underlying healthy complications, who have not had heart attack or stroke etc in recent months, who have not been in and out of hospital, who are not dying from disease of cancer or some neurological disease...

5. Two weeks is average transmission period for the virus. Its been eight since it was first introduced. When sent data through an AI to predict the outcome. The computer predicted 2.5 billion infected with 53 million dead.

To put it into perspective I am one of those high-risk individuals because I have glaucoma and COPD which means that I really have to be monitored. Yet I feel pretty good about the outcome.

My brother is a pharmacist and I have two friends that are doctors.  They all tell me the same thing. Yet.... something in my gut says otherwise.

2020-02-07,nezia,Coronavirus,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/f0h6kv/secretly_prepping_in_central_europe/fgubu62/,"Those ""half-masks"" with replaceable filters (often 2) are mainly used in heavy industries or metal/wood working, construction or paintshops.

There are separate European norms for them.   


What those masks will share with the ""medical"" filtering face piece respirators is the P1, P2 or P3 or particle filter rating. If you can find filter mats with a ""P3"" rating they will also filter 99% of the particles, just like the FFP3 respirators.  


Some of those masks will either require or offer an option to attach additional carbon or membrane filters to them. Some of them with specific filtering abilities. A common one that you can widely find is ABEK1, which would mean filter level 1 for anorganic (A), organic (B), acidic gases (E) and ammonia (K).   


If you buy such a reusable half-mask body with replaceable filters and it says A2P2, it would mean filter level 2 for both anorganic gases and particles.  


Anyhow. While the mask bodies are reusable (they require thorough cleaning, though) the filters reusability is limited.  


The N95 or FFP3 are usually at max. worn for one shift or 8h. Once you take them off your face they are often (depends on the field you work in) considered to be contaminated and will be replaced with a fresh one. While this is less of an issue in metal/wood working or a paintshop, this is crucial in the medical field or in labs.  


With the reusable half-masks the carbon filter usage time is often valued at 40h. The usage time of the additional particle filters will range in the same time, as those FFP3 respirators.  


All in all the statement that the best filter is to not touch your face, is probably the best advice. Start to learn that behavior now.  


Another question you asked was regarding skiing goggles. Those won't suffice, as they usually have foam material at the top/bottom to allow air to through so that the googles don't fog up.  
Cheap swimming goggles should work, but also any sealed goggle for metal/wood working.  


The best goggles however will be to not be sneezed or coughed at."

Additionally, they’re changing their treatment protocol to remdesivir after FDAs approval for “compassionate release” due to the emergency situation. In a nature study, chloroquine and remdesivir show huge potential for the treatment and harm reduction of this virus.  
Prior to this, those hospitalized in China were only treated with antibiotics (as noted in the study) which wouldn’t improve mortality rate of the virus but would help with secondary infections (opportunistic pneumonia being the main one).  Hopefully a new study will be coming out soon on the efficacy of remdesivir. Those treated in the US improved while on it prior to them releasing the drug to China."

2020-02-07,rk1213,Coronavirus,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/f03otp/rounding_up_the_infected_for_mass_quarantine/fgt889b/,"sorry. I have to strongly disagree here. Yes, other nations may mass quarantine people if deemed necessary, but certainly not in the way China does. Have you seen what it's like in those quarantine ""centres""? There have been multiple leaked videos coming from inside those places and it's far, far from helping those inside. For example, thousands of people share only one toilet that is outdoors in the freezing cold. People are so desperate that some have resorted to deficate on the ground surrounding the toilet and elsewhere. There are NO MEDICIAL EQUIPMENT/MEDICINE and there lacks medical staff there. If anyone needed medication, they need to contact their relatives/friends outside to bring it to them. They lay in open spaces with no walls or even curtains between patients so the risk of cross-infection to anyone in there is extremely high. The people there aren't being put there to get better, they're there as a desperate attempt to stop the spread and to make the government look like they're helping."

This could be why the numbers are dropping while experts believe the virus still spreads. Would you report that you have it if it meant going to internment camps?

it also means that the true number of infected and dead can be easier hidden from the world."

That means most of the 17,000 cases are 2 weeks old or less. Given that, it's not surprising only 2% of the cases have resulted in death so far. Keep in mind that there are currently 4k cases listed as serious or Critial (800 of the 4k) in Hubei province right now. 

From [doctor reports we're seen](https://www.straitstimes.com/asia/east-asia/reporters-notebook-life-and-death-in-a-wuhan-coronavirus-icu), symptoms get progressively worse for 2 weeks, and then the 3rd week determines if the person's immune system will fight off the virus or if they'll succumb to it.
