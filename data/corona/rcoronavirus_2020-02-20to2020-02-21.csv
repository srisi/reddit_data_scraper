The government has been super transparent with information so it calms everyone down. I haven’t seen much panic shopping in supermarkets this week and there appears to be less people wearing masks on the street. 

Restaurants can be quite empty though. People are hesitating to go, it seems. 

In the office, people are cautious. Temp testing happening twice a day for everyone and people aren’t shaking hands, which is quite awkward for me because I meet a lot of new people in my job. 

Haven’t been to the hospital for about 3 weeks but back then the protocol I experienced was good but it was clear staff were ‘still learning’ and it was a bit chaotic. I’m assuming that has improved. 

Most of us are getting increasingly worried about a possible widening of the travel ban to include Singapore.  A lot of people here are foreign workers who depend on travel in region and across the world.  It would be a nightmare scenario if we are out of the country, ban takes place and cant get home.

She noted the U.S. government had already told passengers they would not be evacuated with anyone who was infected or showed symptoms. She was also concerned about infection control.

Anthony Fauci, head of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, who was also on the calls, recalled saying her points were valid and should be considered.

But Robert Kadlec, assistant secretary for preparedness and response for the Department of Health and Human Services and a member of the coronavirus task force, pushed back: Officials had already prepared the plane to handle passengers who might develop symptoms on the long flight, he argued. The two Boeing 747s had 18 seats cordoned off with 10-foot-high plastic on all four sides. Infectious disease doctors would also be onboard."""

Regular isolation gear and masks are miserable enough during my 12 hour shifts, wearing a full bio suit and working the hours they’re working would be hell.  


They’re wearing diapers because getting the suits off is such a pain (and you’re supposed to throw them out after taking off), so they’re very likely not drinking enough fluids, and if it’s warm in the hospitals they’re sweating.  You can get miserably hot working hard in isolation gear.  Dehydration and electrolyte imbalance are s motherfucker, especially if you’ve got a virus cooking.  It’s terrible.


I wouldn’t say 80+ years old are the people who need to worry most, my guess is like 55/65+.  As a regular younger person not being run into the ground like those doctors are, I’m personally not worried about the virus, but I am nervous that people will get crazy."

I'm hoping this new format will give everyone a better view of the data.

I am still working on a new extrapolation method, this time based on rate of growth and infection rate, as suggested by another redditor. I'll try to add that in within the next couple of days.

This would explain why entire families of 5+ people are being killed despite just a 2-3% CFR.

With plague, you can have bubonic affecting the lymph nodes and it is mostly transmitted via fleas.  However, if the plague migrates to your lungs, it becomes pneumonic plague, and suddenly H2H transmission is much more prevalent via respiratory droplets. Pneumonic plague is more deadly than bubonic plague with pneumonic fatality rates approaching 100% if untreated.

I wonder if something like this is happening with COVID-19.  One person in a family gets the virus deep in their lungs, gets pneumonia, gets the coughing, and that expels small respiratory droplets from deep in the lungs which in turn are inhaled deeply into the lungs of those around them.  The cycle repeats.  

However, what if one person is infected instead via mouth or nose, for example.  Do they develop pneumonia?  Are those around them less likely to be infected deep in their lungs? 

If this is true, it might even explain higher mortality in Wuhan even though the virus hasn't mutated much.  Once you had too many pneumonias in Wuhan, the incidence of aerosolized transmission increased and those infected by that method were infected more deeply in their lungs since aerosols tend to be inhaled more deeply into the lungs.  Mortality and transmission rates shoot up because the virus went more ""pneumonic"" and ""aerosolized"" in that area."

After the initial Wuhan outbreak, when cases were popping up all over the world, someone brought the virus to Iran. Since Iran is dealing with so much else at the moment -  political tension and instability, protests, inflation - testing for Coronavirus was not a top priority. 

So for the past few weeks, people with symptoms were ignored, or mistaken as flu victims. Since then the situation has escalated, and people have died. Iran knows they can't ignore the issue any longer and must disclose this to the world. But they still haven't been testing, so they don't have accurate numbers. All they know is a bunch of people are now sick and some are dying.

Thoughts?"

The level of incompetence would have to be so monumental that it defies belief. What is far more believable to me is that by delaying testing and putting people into quarantine (imposes or otherwise), they allow Americans to become familiar with it before it starts hitting close to home. 

If the first people heard about the virus was that their friends started dying, people would understandably fear the worst and panic. Panic is incredibly dangerous from a government perspective. 

Here’s how I expect it to play out: They’ll get the “problem“ sorted out in a day or two, and we’re going to start hearing about a rising number of increasing cases starting in about a week. Slow at first, and then suddenly much quicker once we have a few deaths under our belt.

However it’s almost impossible not to go out at all as I had to go out 3 times during my 14 days to get supplies and food. Despite this though everyone I know is being super careful and wearing masks when they go anywhere public. To be honest everyone who came back from China knows how bad it is in China and are probably more afraid and cautious than the general population. I am sure there are a few who don’t care but most of us are more concerned that the US isn’t taking more precautions.

The 80 year old person already accrued a few hundred good fucks and did with their life what the could.

After you're 75-80, grim reaper takes interest, so it's kind of natural. If it wasn't a virulent disease, then it's something else.

Of course death is still death and people are still people. But old pelple die often.

2020-02-20,kusuriurikun,Coronavirus,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/f703zn/major_gatherings/fi89wik/,"It should be noted the particular church in South Korea [is a megachurch widely considered a coercive religious group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shincheonji_Church_of_Jesus_the_Temple_of_the_Tabernacle_of_the_Testimony)\--and is one of those groups that is euphemistically referred to as ""high demand"" (in that pretty much the entirety of the social life of the members is supposed to revolve around the church and church-related activities) and apparently uses[a rather MLM-like organizational structure that tends to be common across coercive ""Bible-based"" groups into ""discipling and shepherding""](https://www.dailykos.com/stories/2007/8/11/370152/-Dominionist-cell-churches-and-religious-abuse).

This group seems to be particularly modeled on the Unification Church/Moonies in how it operates, but with a fair amount added from certain New Apostolic Reformation-linked coercive groups into the ""Discipling and Shepherding"" thing, Maranatha in particular (no relation to the nut butter manufacturers).  Considering [the world's largest NAR-linked megachurch historically was based in South Korea and functionally operated as the Assemblies of God in that country](https://www.dailykos.com/story/2006/10/23/260706/-The-Most-Influential-Dominionist-You-ve-Never-Heard-Of) and arguably [the entire ""MLM""/""Discipling and Shepherding"" model may well have originated in South Korea](https://www.dailykos.com/stories/2007/8/10/369739/-Dominionist-cell-churches-a-history) (via Soka Gakkai), it's not really surprising that coercive ""Bible-based"" groups in South Korea tend to glom on that model...and churches that start out culty, or go culty, *are* a definite problem in South Korea in particular.

(And probably the *last* thing I expected to actually be discussing on what is functionally a ""pop epidemiology"" subreddit was how coercive religious groups operate, but that particular subject seems to follow me despite my best intentions.  Then again, having actually grown up in probably one of the first ""transmissions"" of NAR theology out of that million-member megachurch that pretty much invented the concept of Pyramid-Structured Churches...this does give me some unique insight. \*shrugs\*)

Now, as for the epidemiology (and if there's anything I never expected to discuss anywhere, it's the epidemiology of infectious diseases in ""Bible-based cults"" outside of the context of people refusing to vaccinate their kids against childhood illnesses because they think the shots are made from Baby Slurry)...

In these sorts of groups, pretty much *your entire world is supposed to be the cult*; about the only permissible activity outside of it is ""missionary"" activity dedicated to drawing in new members, and generally this isn't allowed until someone is well and truly ""set in"".  Before that, there is an awful lot of fear induction of the outside world, isolation from the outside world, fluffing-up that Only The Cult Can Save The World, and a LOT of tugging on the heartstrings--both negative (the fear of Outside) and positive (the cult is promoted as the only source of actual safety).  [Most of the actual tactics used actually tend to be common across coercive groups](https://freedomofmind.com/bite-model/), whether it be Scientology, the Moonies, NXIVM, the New Apostolic Reformation, or Shincheonji Church of Jesus, or even non-religious cults of personality.

Some cults also do things like communal dinners and communal childrearing (sometimes large scale, sometimes smaller scale--""Bible-based cults"", of note, tend to go for things like the ultimate point of contact being a ""cell church group"" of six to twelve people with a leader who may meet as often as daily, but you do get some groups like the Moonies that do things like the ""mass weddings"", and the New Apostolic Reformation has a ""distinguisher"" of massive ""outpourings""--huge revival meetings that run continuously for months or even over a year at  a time that people will attend on a daily or multiple-times-a-week basis).

In terms of epidemiology...this means that pretty much all of your contacts (by and large) will be within the cult, you'll be meeting up with your cult members frequently, and--because of the ""pyramidal scale""--even your cell church leader will be meeting up with THEIR supervisory cell, and THAT leader with HIS cell, and so on all the way up to the leader of the church.  And pretty much all of your social contacts, even for things like entertainment, shopping, possibly even visiting the doctor...are all going to be contacts within the cult.

Which makes it incredibly, *incredibly* easy for Contagious Stuff to spread.  (More than one measles outbreak has ultimately been traced to a homeschooler's group, and at least one other multistate epidemic was ultimately traced to an Old Order Amish pastor who went on a missionary trip to an Amish colony in the Philippines and brought back an unwelcome gift.)  Really, a high-demand coercive religious group is one of the *best* potential places for a disease to spread--especially as a lot of these groups tend to put a heavy emphasis on trying to cure an illness with the power of prayer before seeing the doctor.

Of course, the bad part is...well...cults like to recruit people, and are not above setting up front businesses or (in particularly extreme cases) setting up fake relationships (either as friends, or even as romantic partners) to pull you into the cult.  And they do missionary activity which makes it easy for that stuff to spread.

(Again, I think the last thing I expected to ever talk about here is the epidemiology of what happens with a COVID-19 outbreak in a Moonies-esque high-demand religious cult!)"

First coronavirus patient in Santa Clara County released from isolation

 And, the couple from Northern California we’re discharged”in good health.” - see below as well:


The man was one of two people in Santa Clara County who were confirmed to be infected with the coronavirus. Two days later, county health officials confirmed a second, unrelated novel coronavirus infection in someone they described only as “an adult female” who had recently traveled to Wuhan and arrived Jan. 23 to visit family in the county.

Santa Clara County health officials have said she has stayed home since she arrived except for two occasions when she sought outpatient medical care. She was never sick enough to be hospitalized and also has been regularly monitored. She was still under isolation Thursday, Moles said.

Two other Northern California cases were confirmed Feb. 2 in San Benito County, a husband and wife both age 57. San Benito County health officials said the husband recently traveled from Wuhan, but his wife did not and was believed to have been infected through him. They were later transferred to the University of California San Francisco hospital for a higher level of care.

The San Francisco Department of Public Health said Friday the couple were discharged from UCSF “in good health,” but would not say whether they had fully recovered and been cleared to resume their normal lives. Shawn Merillat, a spokesman for San Benito County’s health department, said Thursday the agency had nothing to report on the couple’s condition

Five San Jose hospital workers were sent home as a precaution after they were exposed last month to the county’s first coronavirus case at Good Samaritan Hospital in San Jose. They were cleared to work Feb. 12 after showing no symptoms over 14 days, health officials said.

Health officials are also monitoring 300 county residents who are healthy but face increased risk of acquiring the new coronavirus illness because they traveled in mainland China within the last two weeks, Dr. Sara Cody, county health director, said Wednesday. They have been told to “self-quarantine,” stay home, limit contact with others and report their health status to county authorities.

Moles said the department continues to work closely with healthcare providers, hospitals and others to monitor the novel coronavirus. Currently, she said, there is no evidence that the virus is circulating in Santa Clara County, and risk to the public remains low."

They don't, really.  It is assumed that if you test positive then you are capable and probably actively shedding.  If you test negative, then it is assumed you are not shedding.

To my knowledge, direct tests of viral shedding are extremely difficult and I know of only a few.  Even longstanding viruses like influenza are poorly understood in their spread.  We know, for example, influenza can spread via close contact, large respiratory droplets, and aerosols, but there's scant data in exactly how prevalent each mode of spread actually is."

There is definitely something more at play here but it’s too early to know what. Like someone else mentioned, I’m wondering if perhaps the route of infection is playing a role like it does in plague, if there are genetic components at play, if he had perhaps cytokine storm which caused severe damage, an unknown co-occurring infection, or if the air pollution there is exacerbating the problem. Worst case, it could be reinfection, like dengue fever, causing more drastic illness on re-exposure. Whatever the cause, I hope we have some answers soon."
