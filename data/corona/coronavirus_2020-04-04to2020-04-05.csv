Thinking about my mom dying, my husband, or god-forbid, my son dying, are beyond comprehension to me. I literally have to stop thinking about it immediately and make a conscious effort to think about something else. Thinking about losing my son is a crippling, overwhelming fear that would have me slumped in the foetal position crying if I let myself dwell on it. 

The only support I can give is to say you're not alone. The fear of losing loved ones is gripping a great deal of us now.

The coping mechanism I have is to keep my mind busy and I've also had cognitive behavior therapy for anxiety, which has helped with some tips for catastophizing (imagining the worst case scenario, even if that isn't likely to happen, and thinking that you won't be able to cope in that scenario). Here's an example article,  [https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/320844](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/320844)  but if you search for catastrophizing coping or something similar then you'll get lots of coping tips. 

Some of the tips include not only reminding yourself that this worst case scenario isn't likely to happen - the vast majority of people with coronavirus experience mild or no symptoms. The death rate is still very small, and also coming to terms with the fact that you are strong and if you did lose one of your parents, you would be able to cope even though it seems horrific. I honestly think if I lost my son I would be suicidal, so it's very hard for me to think of going on and carrying on living in that situation, so I'm still working on that. It's always a work in progress and it's good to just try and work through things on a regular, even daily basis, even if you can't do all the things suggested."

In 2015, a team including scientists from the Institute published successful research on whether a bat coronavirus could be made to infect HeLa.

The App, called ‘AarogyaSetu’ joins Digital India for the health and well-being of every Indian. The App will enable people to assess themselves the risk for their catching the Coronavirus infection.
It will calculate this based on their interaction with others, using cutting edge Bluetooth technology, algorithms and artificial intelligence.
Once installed in a smartphone through an easy and user-friendly process, the app detects other devices with Aarogya Setu installed that come in the proximity of that phone.
The app can then calculate the risk of infection based on sophisticated parameters if any of these contacts is tested positive.
The App will help the Government take necessary timely steps for assessing risk of spread of COVID-19 infection, and ensuring isolation where required.
The App’s design ensures privacy-first. The personal data collected by the App is encrypted using state-of-the-art technology and stays secure on the phone till it is needed for facilitating medical intervention.
Available in 11 languages, the App is ready for pan-India use from day-1 and has highly scalable architecture. This app is a unique example of the nation’s young talent coming together and pooling resources and efforts to respond to a global crisis. 
It is at once a bridge between public and private sectors, digital technology and health services delivery and the potential of young India with a disease-free and healthy future of the nation. "

I won't be able to tell you everything about 'autres' ! Let us just say a few things
and just be concerned with the cases when the 'autre' phrase is a partitive phrase, 
as is the case in your text.


First, note that **when used with a partitive**, 'autre(s)' behaves as an adjective, and follows the rule
according to which partitive 'de la, du, des, de l'' is reduced to 'de' before an adjective
(il a dit de nombreuses bêtises vs il a dit des bêtises etc.).
So it is 'd'autres personnes' and even 'd'autre(s)' when not followed by a noun.


* When the 'autre' phrase is a direct object, the noun (and its satellites), if not repeated, must be replaced by 'en' :

Il reste des gâteaux, tu en veux encore ? Non, je n'**en** veux pas d'autre(s).
(or non, je ne veux pas d'autre(s) gâteau(x)

Est-ce que tu connais d'autres livres de cet auteur ? Non, je n'**en** connais pas d'autre.
(or non je ne connais pas d'autres livres de lui)


* When the 'autre' phrase is a grammatical subject, then you may use it without 'en' ('en' is impossible
in this case):

Certains prétendent que le coronavirus sera vaincu en quinze jours, mais d'autres pensent que ce
sera beaucoup plus long !

* When the 'autre' phrase is truly prepositional, then it is better to use a noun:

Est-ce que vous comptez sur ce médicament pour vaincre le coronavirus ?

Non, je compte sur d'autres médicaments

(in this case ~~je compte sur d'autres~~ or ~~j'en compte sur d'autres~~ are impossible)."

There's only 7 coronaviruses that can be found in humans. 4 of them cause mild/cold-like symptoms. The other 3 are SARS, MERS, and Covid-19 which all cause serious illness. Neither SARS nor MERS ever reached the scale of infection that Covid-19 has. In fact, far more people have died from Covid-19 than have ever been infected by SARS and MERS combined. 

Here's an [article](https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/coronavirus-diseases-comparing-covid-19-sars-mers-numbers-n1150321) comparing the 3 viruses if you're interested. Keep in mind though, the article was written on Mar 5, 2020. The charts it shows say that there's 430k cases and 19k deaths from Covid-19. Barely a month later, there's over 1 million cases and the death toll is up to 59k. So really, the differences between the 3 coronaviruses is even more staggering than the article says.

I said it being a new virus was *one* of the reasons it was so dangerous. Not the only one. Of course there are several reasons Covid-19 is so dangerous, like the rapid spread rate you mentioned. But a big part of it spreading so quickly is **because** it's a completely new virus. The fact that it's completely new and nobody has any kind of antibodies or immunity built up makes it much worse. Here's another [article](https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/how-the-virus-that-causes-covid-19-differs-from-other-coronaviruses/) on that, if you're interested.

Again no, we *do* have ways to treat certain more serious viruses. There can be either vaccines to prevent infection or specific medication proven to help fight the infection. For example, influenza has vaccines and Tamiflu. Since Covid-19 is new, there are no vaccines and there is no medicine designed to help you get over the virus."

To contrast, Rush Limbaugh was awarded the medal of freedom and said this:

Why do you think Trump rewards disinformation agents like Limbaugh while a Navy Captain who told the truth is fired?  Isn’t this the type of thing China or North Korea would do?"

Rob Jackson, who chairs the Global Carbon Project, which produces widely-watched annual emissions estimates, said carbon output could fall by more than 5% year-on-year - the first dip since a 1.4% reduction after the 2008 financial crisis.
“I wouldn’t be shocked to see a 5% or more drop in carbon dioxide emissions this year, something not seen since the end of World War Two,” Jackson, a professor of Earth system science at Stanford University in California said.
“Neither the fall of the Soviet Union nor the various oil or savings and loan crises of the past 50 years are likely to have affected emissions the way this crisis is,” he said.
The prediction – among a range of new forecasts being produced by climate researchers - represents a tiny sliver of good news in the midst of crisis: Climate scientists had warned world governments that global emissions must start dropping by 2020 to avoid the worst impacts of climate change.
Experts warn that without structural change, the emissions declines caused by coronavirus could be short-lived and have little impact on the concentrations of carbon dioxide that have accumulated in the atmosphere over decades.
“This drop is not due to structural changes so as soon as confinement ends, I expect the emissions will go back close to where they were,” said Corinne Le Quéré, a climate scientist at the University of East Anglia in eastern England."

Farms can only hold as much as their milk tank allows and milk trucks might be diverted or the drivers put to use elsewhere. Plus, cheese factories might not be working at their full capacity and need less milk. The US has enough food. But getting it harvested, transported, and packaged is going to be the issue. 

And we have to hope to have a good farming year. Last year, it rained so much some fields were never sown because it was never dry enough for the tractors to go out before it was too late in the season to plant."

The idea of 'Muslims' causing the 'perfect system' of defense against this virus to break down is being spread, and events like these are ignored, no one, no one deserves accusations like these, the tablighee did a mistake, even though that happened before the official lockdown and stuff, and not everyone was that aware and conscious of the virus, they did, but those individuals who were there are now treated as criminals, and if that wasn't enough, 'unexpectedly enough' people are blaming the whole community now. I agree that they should have been more aware and called it all off, it's how it should have [actually been handled](https://www.newsweek.com/prophet-prayer-muhammad-covid-19-coronavirus-1492798), but now making them and the Muslim community as scapegoats for this is ridiculous, which the post itself proves.

I don't think anyone here blames any community for this, which is the point, mistakes can happen by anyone, no one should blame their whole community and belief for it, nor should the accusation be more than it deserves.

“How much will I receive?

It depends on your state.

Benefits will be expanded in an attempt to replace the average worker’s paycheck, explained Andrew Stettner, a senior fellow at the Century Foundation, a public policy research group. The average worker earns about $1,000 a week, and unemployment benefits often replace roughly 40 to 45 percent of that. The expansion will pay an extra amount to fill the gap.

Under the plan, eligible workers will get an extra $600 per week on top of their state benefit. But some states are more generous than others. According to the Century Foundation, the maximum weekly benefit in Alabama is $275, but it’s $450 in California and $713 in New Jersey.

So let’s say a worker was making $1,100 per week in New York; she’d be eligible for the maximum state unemployment benefit of $504 per week. Under the new expansion, she gets an additional $600 of federal pandemic unemployment compensation, for a total of $1,104, essentially replacing her original paycheck.”"

Nations are lying to one another and speaking of solidarity while refusing to share supplies.

Biden is of a system that is very comfortable with people dying, just maybe not so close to home and maybe not so many white people.

'Universal healthcare' is threatened with collapse in Europe because politicians who probably get on very well with Biden, or would, had not problem hollowing out their public service systems from behind, parceling off pieces to the private sector.

The only difference between Biden and Trump is that Trump -- in his idiocy -- doesn't realise he should be dissembling more about the nature of market-obsessed property-societies. They don't even differ on rape any more -- they are both pro-rape."

PM also said that the way India paid gratitude to people fighting against coronavirus on March 22 has become a global model that is being emulated by other countries. PM Modi added, “Janta Curfew and ringing of bells/clanging utensils, made the country aware of its unity amid this challenging time.”
PM Modi urged everyone to switch off all the lights of their homes on 5th April at 9 PM for 9 minutes, and light a candle, diya or switch on mobile flashlight, to mark our fight against coronavirus.

* The paper comes from the University Hospital RWTH Aachen, the first major hospital to deal with a surge in COVID hospitalizations because of its proximity to the Heinsberg cluster. The hospital buiding is the largest in Europe and one of the largest in the world since nearly all departements and many research facilities are located in one single building, beloved for its [industrial](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/97/Klinikum_Aachen_%28Seitenansicht%29.jpg) [charme](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/31/KlinikumAachen.jpg). Ah, fond memories of working without day light.
* Of 50 admitted patients, 24 had ARDS and were intubated, 8 on ECMO. All other 26 required supplemental oxygen.
* **Between symptom onset and hospitalization only four days** (shorter than previously e.g. in Wuhan), 80% were febrile, half had cough or dyspnea, only one a running nose, two throat pain. GI symptoms in six  patients.
* 2/3rd male, ALL 50 patients with some kind of **previous medical history**. 35 aHTN, 29 DM, 25 COPD, asthma or OSAS. Obesity risk factor for ARDS. Viral load had no correlation for ARDS.
* 35 of 50 cases not closed yet. Eight discharged, seven died, four of them were on DNR/DNI.

French regions have similiar accusations. 3M and the White House deny them.

There are now at least **2,300 infected hospital physicians and nurses** but no publicly announced causalities yet. Turns out, we don't have a functional federal reporting system for this, the cases run along the other ones. The major hospital physician union (MB) is furious about the fact and that this means that airborne vs. droplet policies can't be really compared ([source in German](https://www.zdf.de/nachrichten/panorama/aerzte-krankenpfleger-corona-100.html)). **€1500 of hazard pay/""Corona bonus""** will now be tax-free and the Association of Statuatory Insurances says they are open for a €1500 bonus for every nurse ([source](https://www.handelsblatt.com/dpa/konjunktur/wirtschaft-handel-und-finanzen-corona-bonus-fuer-pflegekraefte-im-gespraech/25715034.html?ticket=ST-2023612-kgBzntPev7ckWKcGZu1o-ap1)).

* 80.7% support the **soft lockdown** (mandatory social distancing but two persons not living in a household can meet in public), 41% are in support of an exit strategy with preferential protection for risk groups.
* Only 4.1% in favor of an enforced herd immunity strategy (a.k.a. the *Johnson purge*), 10.7% in favor of a hard lockdown, 16.8% in favor of abandoning lockdown with public masking
* 88% believe the lower CFR in Germany is the result of mass testing finding more mild cases, 87.3% believe the health care system is better suited than in countries with a higher CFR (personal opinion: arrogant take from people who've left clinical medicine). Still, 43% maintain Italy and Spain are just ahead of the curve. 21% believe Germany will experience similiar triage situations.

Italian relief transports are headed towards Germany. You've read that right. Panic buying continues (it's going to be worse before Easter, Germans think four days without possible grocery shopping are worse than the pandemic) and **ALDI organizes special cargo trains for noodles**. 60,000 packages of fusilli, 75,000 of penne and 250,000 of spaghetti have already reached the country and many more will continue ([press release by ALDI](https://unternehmen.aldi-sued.de/de/presse/pressemitteilungen/unternehmen/2020/pressemitteilung-aldi-laesst-mehr-als-200-tonnen-pasta-in-sonderzugen-aus-italien-kommen/)).

Two sides of a coin: **Some hospitals start sending employees into federally subsidized/paid reduced work hours**. The sudden stop of elective procedures and admissions combined with the fact that in most places reinforcements from outside of IM/intensive medicine/pulm care/anesthesia&EM have not been called in yet, leaves many other specialities without work for now a prolonged time until the worst peak of the wave hits ([source in German](https://www.spiegel.de/wirtschaft/unternehmen/trotz-corona-pandemie-warum-kliniken-jetzt-kurzarbeit-anmelden-a-3dc61bc9-fb12-4298-8022-bb4c2be39d7d)).

The State Government of Northrhine-Westphalia (Conservatives and center-right Liberals) failed to implement its heavily criticized **medical draft bill** in their first attempt. The opposition  parties (Social Democrats, Greens, Far-Right) forced the bill (fine up to €500k for medical professionals for non-compliance with the draft) into committee hearings. The constitutionality is heavily disputed and many health care workers feel deeply disappointed by their state government ([source 1](https://www.zeit.de/arbeit/2020-04/corona-krise-aerzte-pflegekraefte-arbeit-verpflichtung-armin-laschet) [and 2](https://www.wz.de/nrw/epidemie-gesetz-in-nrw-muss-warten-kein-blankoscheck-fuer-laschet_aid-49862031)).

The State of Hamburg is not happy with the **mortality reporting system** in Germany which includes all patients who died with a positive test. The RKI reported 12 dead for Hamburg, but Hamburg had all cases sent into forensic medicine and the more extensive forensic medicine reports count only eight of those as caused by COVID-19. Typical big city phenomenon, they can have all their patients sent into forensic medicine for now, more rural states less so ([source in German](https://www.aerzteblatt.de/nachrichten/111613/Hamburg-fordert-genauere-Beurteilung-der-Todesumstaende-von-Corona-Infizierten))."

He stated that Hindu Yuva Vahini is doing the work of uniting Hindus

That filth and his officials put up fake charges against Muslims under NSA like doctor Kafeel khan.

No Muslim is ever going to believe that jamaati were roaming around naked listening to vulgar songs and molesting nurses. Almost all Muslims know Tablighi jamaat members because they interact with them daily.

You can believe in some absolutely absurd allegations coming from a terrorist adityanaths state who has a history of implicating Muslims in fake charges. But majority of Muslims are not because that news is absolutely absurd. If you believe in absurd allegations coming from a state ruled by an filth like adityanath, you will be put in the same category of them."

I did not say I want 43,000 flu deaths each year. Why are you putting words in my mouth? Influenza is a serious disease. Quarantining the country has serious repercussions as well. Whether we quarantine or not has to be decided on a case by case basis weighing the expected cost and benefit 

Ok but assuming the benefits are equal, wouldn't the cost in the cost-benefit analysis you mention at the end there come down to things like total deaths? Therefore, if influenza has more total deaths, the cost benefit analysis of locking down for influenza would be the more logically than locking down for covid, which means one would ought to lock down for influenza if they lock down for covid

> Part of the problem is that COV-SAR-2 is a new disease strain. We really didn't (and still don't) know how bad it could really be 

I disagree with that premise, because a) covid in a family of viruses that are known, but more importantly b) Italy expects to reach their peak next week, thus we can do analysis with the data based off the very valid assumption Italy will peak next week, compare numbers to theirs etc. source for italy next week:  [https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p0886q59](https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p0886q59) 

> Early indications were that it was more severe (spreads faster and higher mortality rate) than influenza 

Right, but new indications, studies, and models show it is certainly plausible covid will have 36,000 deaths (source:  [https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2020/03/31/us-coronavirus-deaths-could-peak-mid-april-restrictions-states/5100513002/](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2020/03/31/us-coronavirus-deaths-could-peak-mid-april-restrictions-states/5100513002/) ), which would be less than influenza's 43,000 Oct1-March21 average (source:  [https://www.cdc.gov/flu/about/burden/preliminary-in-season-estimates.htm](https://www.cdc.gov/flu/about/burden/preliminary-in-season-estimates.htm) )

> We cannot wait until the disease has run its course and then decide whether drastic steps were needed 

Again, Italy peak and other partial data will allow us to run the numbers to actually create very accurate models. The field of machine learning and AI has progressed very well to the point partial data and making predictions is something computers running statistical models can predict with inhuman accuracy

> Perhaps after this year's experience, we won't bother with lock-downs and quarantines for COVID-19 either 

Perhaps, but the logical conclusion would be that if any virus comes along that is at least equal or worse quatitatively than covid, then we ought to lock down. That could mean lock down every flu season, if covid's numbers hit the lower end of the projection and only kill 36,000, that would mean logically we ought to shut down for the 43,000 death influenza going forward, otherwise it would be hypocritical

> Without quarantining, we could probably expect maybe 10 times as many people to be exposed by this point. So, 10 times as many vulnerable people, so 10 times as many deaths 

No, that is again another completely false premise with absolutely no data to back it up. Notice how I am sharing all sorts of data from CDC, BBC, etc. and you aren't? Anyways, the data on this issue could actually support the idea that the quaratine is ineffective, considering Sweden as a case study, which has not had strict lockdown measures, yet are fairing better than most other European countries. Now if you want to hear my bullshit reasoning (although my data backs up the point regardless), I think this could be due to the fact we have the entire city meeting up the supermarket to touch the same screens, handles, doors, etc. and that uber drivers essentially become supercarriers as they go from house to house infecting everyone along the way ostensibly. Everything you say below this about 20x people dying is based off this false premise I debunked here

> Again you are putting words in my mouth that I didn't say. This isn't a simple either/or questions. We can't simply lock-down the country every year for 180 days. Medically, it would save lives, but economically it would cost dearly. Maybe we won't lock down the country in the future for COVID-19, if we learn the profile doesn't warrant it. Maybe we will institute more quarantining for influenza if our experience with COVID-19 shows we can withstand the cost. All I'm saying is that, based on what we knew in February, quarantining looked like the right course of action. 

I am not putting words in my mouth I am just following the logical conclusions from what is being said, if you think we need to lockdown for a virus that kills 36,000, then you ought to support a lockdown every flu season when death tolls are predicted to be over 36,000, otherwise you would be hypocritical and prejudiced towards certain viruses"

The government is currently dealing with the coronavirus issues, and most things are delayed a bit. Official info from the regulator is, that we're moving on with 5g deployment, after the 'strategy' (for management of radiofrequency spectrum) is signed by the government."

Also it is a respiratory virus, the primary way you are going to get it is from breathing it in, through your nose or mouth.

> At present in the US, any death of a Covid-19 patient, no matter what the physician believes to be the direct cause, is counted for public reporting as a Covid-19 death.

So if you were in hospital getting treated for Covid, and a meteor crashed through the ceiling onto your head, that would be counted as a Covid death. 

Also, Covid mainly kills old people. So a country with a shockingly bad healthcare system, where few people make it past their 60th birthday, will look better than somewhere like Italy, which has good healthcare and lots of old people. 

And then there's panic. Got the flu? Oh well, stay calm and carry on. But coronavirus? You will panic and start to hyperventilate, especially when you're alone on an isolation ward. Hyperventilation probably isn't great when you're already struggling to breathe.  

As your BBC piece states, we'll probably only know the real effect of Covid when we have solid year-on-year mortality figures. Flu deaths have been declining rapidly for years, see the interesting [chart] (https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/827518/Recent_trends_in_mortality_in_England.pdf) on p26 of this PHE doc. So it's entirely possible that Covid-19 will be about as bad as the flu season in 2004."

or, from [here](https://www.livescience.com/how-long-coronavirus-last-surfaces.html):

SARS-CoV-2 RNA was found on ""a variety of surfaces"" in cabins of both symptomatic and asymptomatic people who were infected with COVID-19 on the Diamond Princess cruise ship, up to ***17 days*** after the passengers disembarked, according to a new analysis from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). However, this was before disinfection procedures took place and ""data cannot be used to determine whether transmission occurred from contaminated surfaces,"" according to the analysis. In other words, it's not clear if the viral particles on these surfaces could have infected people.

Another study published in February in The Journal of Hospital Infection analyzed several dozen previously published papers on human coronaviruses (other than the new coronavirus) to get a better idea of how long they can survive outside of the body. 

They concluded that if this new coronavirus resembles other human coronaviruses, such as its ""cousins"" that cause SARS and MERS, it can stay on surfaces —  such as metal, glass or plastic — for as long as ***nine days*** (In comparison, flu viruses can last on surfaces for only about 48 hours.)"

2020-04-04,justlike-asunflower,stopdrinking,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/fupemw/guilt_and_anxiety_covid19_edition/fme65os/,"Congratulations on your sobriety and on your brand new baby! I’m very happy for you. 
It sounds like you haven’t forgiven yourself for having had a drinking problem, and this is becoming conflated with your coronavirus anxiety. That’s understandable and I’m sure many people are in the same boat. 

First, I think you have to focus on forgiving yourself for your struggles with alcohol. You may have wasted time being drunk or hungover, but you’re DONE with that now. And so much earlier than most other people. Many people don’t quit til they’re in their 40s or 50s. Congratulate yourself, celebrate this accomplishment! Regretting your past can be as big a waste of time as being drunk, so try to let go. I find meditation (free ones on the Meditation Oasis podcast) and therapy (inexpensive therapy at BetterHelp) are two powerful tools for learning to acknowledge these negative feelings without holding onto them and letting them overwhelm you. 

Second, I know coronavirus is scary. But just remember how much healthier you and your family is now because you’re NOT drinking. You e given yourself, your partner, and your new baby so much more health and happiness by being present for them. That in and of itself is a huge gift and preventative measure. Just wash your hands and be careful; you’ll be okay. ❤️
Best of luck. IWNDWYT!"

2020-04-04,SoupOnLeapDays,COVID19,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/fumws7/a_cluster_of_covid19_infections_indicating/fme6iju/,"> We found that there was strong evidence of COVID-19 transmission to contacts outside the immediate family members. Of 539 individuals with close contact with the index patient and his parents-in-law, four tested positive for disease, an attack rate of approximately 0.7%. Based on detailed contact information, we estimate the secondary attack rate among close contacts to be 29% (2/7) and for the casual contacts attending three events (two wedding events and one birth party) to be 0.6% (3/473).

 

How prevalent are SARS-CoV-2 super-spreaders & how significantly do they drive transmission?

Comparing the above social gathering close contact attack rate to two known social gathering clusters in New Zealand (NZ).

Note - below is fairly anecdotal and speculative

 

Two clusters in NZ with possible super spreader's

Bluff, NZ Wedding cluster 1.

- 53 cases out of 70 estimated contacts as at 03/04

Matamata, NZ Saint Patrick's Day bar cluster2.

- 54 cases out of unknown contacts as at 04/04. A small number of these cases were infected after the event3.

 

NZ currently has limited SARS-CoV-2 transmission. 824 total cases as at 04/04.

The country is under lockdown since 25/03 midnight.

 

Transmission types4

 

Recent overseas travel - 47%

Contact with known case - 34%

Community transmission - 1%

Source under investigation - 17%

 

The Matamata cluster index case is presumed to be from one individual with recent international travel history2.

The Bluff cluster index case(s) is currently unknown.

 

The wedding cluster has an attack rate of 75% - 76%.

8 staff working at the wedding all were negative.

The bar looks to have at least 1 metre of separation between staff and guests5.

Both of these events are ideal transmission environments. Indoors, little individual separation, prolonged case exposure, high individual movement, increased droplets due to inebriation.

 

Unfortunately, there's no additional information on the index cases.

I'd speculate the individuals would have mild to no symptoms if they attended prolonged social events.

We estimated that the serial interval was about as long as the incubation period, which is in overall agreement with an independent previous estimate. This finding suggests the possibility of an early peak of infectiousness, with possible transmission of SARS-CoV-2 before the onset of symptoms 6.

 

Other examples of super spreader events include the Shincheonji Church cluster in South Korea7.

 

The above report has significantly lower attack rates.

Are super spreader transmission dynamics from high close droplet spread due to specific environments?

 

Do some individuals have unusual levels of viral shedding?

Understanding of viral load disease severity is currently unclear.

Lombardy study showed no difference in viral load between symptomatic & not8.

China study of patients hospitalised found a significant association between disease severity and upper respiratory viral load9.

 

Curious to hear others thoughts!

2020-04-04,Aussieguy727,nrl,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/nrl/comments/fuqjkj/dave_wont_leave_the_broncos_fifita_to_snub_titans/fme6l2f/,"David Fifita will shun a $3.2 million offer from the Titans and sign a new deal with Brisbane after making a pact with teammate Payne Haas to build a premiership-winning dynasty at the Broncos.

That is the assessment of the most influential person in Fifita’s contract negotiations, his mother Gwen, who has revealed the motivations behind the Queensland Origin star’s desire to remain at Red Hill next season.

The Sunday Mail can reveal Fifita met with the Broncos last week to verbally outline his plan to sign a new deal with the club at a time when the coronavirus saga has left 184 off-contract NRL players in limbo.

Fifita is one of those free agents, but the NRL’s instruction last week to freeze new contract registrations during the COVID-19 crisis does not concern the 20-year-old because he plans to stay loyal to the Broncos for 2021.

The Titans have expressed interest in Fifita, armed with a four-year deal worth about $800,000 per season. The Gold Coast’s overtures follow a recent pursuit by South Sydney, who tabled a massive $6 million, five-year offer, only for Fifita to reject the deal.

Titans culture chief Mal Meninga has vowed to go hard for Fifita but Gwen, a key figure in negotiations, has provided the most compelling insight yet, saying her son has no interest in quitting Brisbane.

“Dave wants to stay at the Broncos,” Gwen Fifita said.

“The whole contract issue has become forgotten because of everything that has happened (with the coronavirus pandemic).

“Just the other night, we were on the couch watching some old games on TV and Dave said, ‘Mum, we have a really good side at the Broncos and if we stick together, we can win premierships. We will be unstoppable’.

“That tells me Dave won’t be leaving the Broncos.

“He is really happy at the club and people don’t realise how close Dave is to his teammates like Payne Haas. He stays at Payne’s place all the time and Dave’s main concern is making sure all the guys stick together at the Broncos.”

Fifita reinforced his standing as the hottest back-row property in the code with a barnstorming 70-metre solo try in round one against the Cowboys before the NRL competition went into suspension.

There were suggestions the COVID-19 ordeal would help rival clubs such as the Titans pull off a Fifita poaching bid - but it will do the opposite.

With NRL clubs bracing for a 20 per cent reduction to next season’s $10 million salary cap, no team will be able to offer Fifita $1 million, nor seriously threaten the $700,000 Brisbane have set aside in their payment ceiling for the Maroons hulk.

South Sydney tried and failed to poach Fifita over summer. Rabbitohs legend Sam Burgess flew north for a secret meeting as part of a Redfern charm offensive, but Fifita, while flattered, politely declined the deal.

“Souths offered him so much money,” Gwen said. “We sat down and did all the numbers but it’s not like you get $1 million in the hand.

“People talk about $1 million contracts, but by the time you take out tax, Dave wouldn’t earn much more at Souths than he would at the Broncos.

“Sam Burgess never came to our house. I don’t know Sam, I haven’t met him in my life. He came to Brisbane and he met up with David, that mission was to specifically meet up with Dave to sign him.

“Wayne (Bennett, Souths coach and Fifita’s former mentor at Brisbane) teed it all up. They caught up in the city. I was supposed to attend but I didn’t go because I was working.

“Putting the money aside, Dave doesn’t like the Sydney life. He doesn’t like the traffic and the bustling life. It would cost him a fortune to buy a place in Sydney so he would be earning less down there anyway.”

The Titans are the only other realistic option for Fifita. He has links to the Gold Coast, having attended Keebra Park High, and has a bond with Titans-bound recruit Tino Fa’asuamaleaui. They played in Queensland junior rep teams and Tino has personally called Fifita urging him to reunite on the holiday strip.

But Gwen believes Fifita’s ties with Broncos prop Haas are unbreakable, especially after their terrifying Bali ordeal last year.

“The Titans are always fishing for David, they have been showing interest,” she said.

“Dave loves the Gold Coast area, don’t get me wrong, he went to school there, but he loves football at the Broncos and the relationships he has built with the players.

“There has been talk about Tino joining the Titans and being mates with Dave, but they never went to school together. Dave went to Keebra with Tanah Boyd and Mo Fotuaika from the Titans.

“Tino and Dave played in Queensland rep sides and they get on well, but his best mate is Payne. They want to stay together.

“The Broncos are home for Dave. He is totally comfortable there.”"

First off, medical people have ALWAYS been wearing mask it is not just for COVID-19. Them wearing mask have NOTHING to do with the COVID-19 situation. Your example of medical people wearing mask to deal with the COVID-19 situation is simply wrong

&#x200B;

2ndly again I want to point out there was NO strong evidence of spread via air AND there was no strong evidence of spread when the person was asymptomatic  


What you are citing is anecdotal evidence. Please go look up the term if you have NO CLUE what that means. It does NOT mean that the evidence is wrong or false. It simply means that it wasn't  properly researched.   


I have no idea why people treating that term like it's somehow fake news. I am simply pointing out the fact that because it is anecdotal evidence and not properly research, your assumption that it can spread via whatever means you claim is at best a guess that has not been confirmed by research. It can be correct and it can also be wrong. There is a reason why treatments are tested thoroughly BEFORE it is actually put to use unlike. When Trump was making claims that certain drugs is effective in treating COVID-19, that is based on anecdotal evidence.  


 [https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/28/coronavirus-cure-fact-check-hydroxychloroquine-trump](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/28/coronavirus-cure-fact-check-hydroxychloroquine-trump)   


Does it work, Maybe or maybe not, we don't know because it was NOT properly researched. Just because it works on one case does not make it a confirmed solution. Like I said earlier correlation does not imply causation(go look up this term as well because you don't seem to know this either). Your case was the same you make a guess based on anecdotal evidence. We have the benefit of hindsight now because its have been proven by research that mask definitely helps due to  Asymptomatic  transmission  


However the government have other considerations to take into account and cannot simply implement policies based on guesswork even if there is good reason to believe it might well be the case. Why was mask not encouraged at the beginning, we already know why. I'm not even defending them, the govt literally told you why. Because we are in this for the long haul and masks need to be prioritized for the medical people. Since there is no strong evidence of it's effectiveness they did not encourage it's used.  


Now that there is they are telling you that it is effective they provide you with the means to protect yourself and I already pointed out the research came out 3 days ago. The fact that they had the reusable mask ready for distribution meant that they were prepared for such a scenario and had began sourcing for the mask BEFORE the research result happen. FYI you actually need time to plan the logistics as well as actually procure the equipment. Things doesn't happen overnight and work by magic, at least not in normal countries outside China"

If you’re using the same bleach & water towel to wipe down surface over and over then it’s 🤢cross contamination.

Because the COVID-19 Virus has a lipid outer layer ( that means FAT LAYER) when that lipid layer is broken down  It exposes the encloses virus. This understanding is very important so I REPEAT - Using soapy water breaks down the lipid  layer Exposing the virus which Then is killed when exposed to the soap.*** An example - cleaning up dirty, greasy dishes using dawn Versus cleaning up dirty greasy dishes Using a bleach and water solution.

BC (Canada), WA, OR, and CA all moved quickly than the rest of the continent.

Background reasons: The west coast is also health-conscious, a bit less religious, a bit more community-oriented, a bit more trusting of expertise, and more closely connected to Asia. Higher percentage of Chinese people who were following developments in Wuhan and cautioning friends to take it seriously. Overall the west coast is a better population cohort to work with in a pandemic.

Right person, right place, right time: The public health officer  in BC, Dr Bonnie Henry, also led the response to the 2003 SARS coronavirus outbreak in Toronto.

As I already wrote ""One method that was being pushed that isn't mentioned in the OP article but has been reported elsewhere is ""ballot harvesting"" in every State.

[https://www.foxnews.com/politics/final-vote-coronavirus-stimulus-bill-now-imminent-amid-tensions-over-provisions](https://www.foxnews.com/politics/final-vote-coronavirus-stimulus-bill-now-imminent-amid-tensions-over-provisions)

>Gone from the stimulus bill are mentions of mandatory early voting, **ballot harvesting**

**.**

>none of the sources presented outline that the bill in question did  not outline or suggest protections against ballot harvesting/outline  regulations about who can and cannot pick up a ballot. 

This is the description that was proposed for the law.  The only protection is that the person collecting couldn't be paid by the ballot. 

[https://www.breitbart.com/2020-election/2020/03/23/pelosi-stimulus-bill-imposes-nationwide-ballot-harvesting-without-any-limit/](https://www.breitbart.com/2020-election/2020/03/23/pelosi-stimulus-bill-imposes-nationwide-ballot-harvesting-without-any-limit/)

> A) shall permit a voter to designate any person to return a voted and  sealed absentee ballot to the post office, a ballot drop-off location,  tribally designated building, or election office so long as the person  designated to return the ballot does not receive any form of  compensation based on the number of ballots that the person has returned  and no individual, group, or organization provides compensation on this  basis; and (B) may not put any limit on how many voted and sealed  absentee ballots any designated person can return to the post office,  a ballot drop off location, tribally designated building, or election  office. 

I see no evidence of any protective measures. 

>Regardless, paper ballots are a million times more secure than any of the current state’s voting systems, 

Only as long as the chain of custody is secure. 

>so unless you can reasonably suggest that “voter harvesting” presents  more of a threat than voter suppression 

I suggest exactly that.  As the examples I bolded in the quote from the source I provided on the topic shows it is trivially easy to commit voter fraud  using ballot harvesting.  Where is the voter suppression in making people mail their own ballot?

>or vote manipulation that can be  done via in person voting machines, I’m not sure what your point is  here. 

Vote manipulation via voting machine is far more difficult.

> Trump also directly said “it means no republicans will get elected  again” (paraphrasing, obviously). Don’t you think that’s much more  telling than this completely obscure ballot harvesting situation that  doesn’t seem to be very common at all?  

There is nothing obscure about it.  Ballot harvesting is credited as being the reason California is completely controlled by the Democratic Party after its use in 2018.

>I mean, paper ballots have been proven to be more secure overall, and I  think that this pandemic has highlighted the need for remote voting  options. 

Filling out and trusting the USPS to deliver a paper ballot is safe because there is a relatively secure chain of custody. 

Dropping it off yourself is even more secure.  Once collected at the polling place there are strict rules for keeping track of all ballots.  

Trusting a unknown volunteer who is being paid by a political party to go door to door collecting as many of them as they can with no oversight is not secure.  The dumpster full of filled out ballots described is why."

The Bolshoi, which closed on March 17 until April 10, joins a string of other Russian theaters, opera houses and museums that have turned to online streaming to satisfy Russians’ cultural needs during the coronavirus lockdown.
Russia has so far recorded 1,036 cases of the virus and five related deaths, and has stepped up measures to curb its spread. This weekend Moscow will shutter all cafes, restaurants and shops apart from those selling food and medicine.
The Bolshoi’s ballet dancers are having to get used to training and keeping in shape at home.
“Of course it’s a very difficult time for us,” Denis Rodkin, a principal dancer, told Reuters on Friday. “We really depend on our profession... I hope that this will not last long and everything will be up and running again soon.”
In the meantime, Rodkin said, the performances streamed online might help keep people’s spirits up while they are confined to their homes.
“Art, and the Bolshoi Theater’s broadcasts in particular, support people in these difficult conditions,” he said. “They will be inspired, recharged with art, and all this will end.”
Ballet soloist Ksenia Zhiganshina also put a brave face on the enforced closure of the theater and its impact on the dancers.

Hi, everybody!

I'm   an Italian telecommunications engineering student. Together with a   colleague we have created a wen site to monitor and confront the   Covid-19 pandemic in the various states of the world and in the various   regions of Italy and America.

The   need to create this platform completely free of charge and without   advertising was born for the absence of a portal that would allow to   compare the graphs and time trends between the various countries.

Take a look at it and if you like, make it known to your friends and relatives:

Daily   information on the Coronavirus pandemic (Covid-19) in Italy and around   the world. On the site you can find all relevant data and compare them   nationally (between regions) or worldwide (between states):

Masks have been extensively used in Asian countries, and guess what? It's been working pretty well. I don't think UK guidelines are to be trusted, UK is arguably one of the worst performers in this pandemic. Japan basically only used masks as a measure, and they have about 1/100 the deaths per capita that UK has. 

Why would wearing a mask be unsafe in any way? Disinfecting them might be a difficulty, but disinfecting a worker who's gotten coughed at is going to be way harder. The virus spreads largely through airborne droplets, something that masks are pretty effective against. So all in all not only was she not putting patients in danger, she was(even in cases of low quality mask) being safer than without a mask.

Supplemental reading, note how the Asian countries all significantly outperform European ones even though the virus got there earlier?

If it's not acceptable why opt for that as your preferred outcome ? You have a choice lockdown for a few years and sacrifice those with mental health issues, those struggling in poverty and domestic abuse victims. Or you shield the predominantly old people from the virus.

Do you steal from those in their prime, or those at the end of their life, it's the trolley problem really.

Your right the NHS hasn't been in a good way in years, almost like we've had the same party in charge for a decade, one favoured by the group most at risk now.

In the same respect someone old and with underlying hesth conditions would have been unlikely to have survived the past winter anyway and succumbed to one of the many winter illnesses  so kinda a moot point really on your part, alas what a shame.

No of coronavirus reported = no of test done 
Now,
India is not even doing 1/10 th of the tests it's supposed to so that leads me to believe that no. Of coronavirus cases reported are much higher in reality than they are being reported so that again leads me to the point that India might be on stage - 3 And you said the people who are showing symptoms are only to be tested then you are fucking moron because in my last post also I mentioned that coronavirus has 14 days of incubation period meaning the person will be asymptomatic but is still a carrier now let's suppose a man is positive but he isnt showing any symptoms so it's likely that the medical staff won't test leave likely that is what is happening we are only fucking checking the people who show symptoms meaning the asymptomatic carrier gets to roam around freely and spread the disease and  let's look at the numbers these types of people can well easily be 100s or even 1000s and the people who he spread it to god knows how many 
Now 
As far as staying at home is concerned then it was only initiated on 26 and lockdown isn't the solution it is just to contain the spread and as far as no of tests we are doing we actually fucking don't know much it is spread!!!! You moron you can understand this fking simple thing!!! We are not fucking doing enough test so that we can actually fucking tell at which stage we are.
As far as Tablighi is concerned they are fucking morons nothing else 
And if you know the new guidelines of ICMR which I think you should if your gf is in medical then they Fucking also changed their testing strategy to testing every fucking patients who comes with respiratory problems and not just people who have travel history and show symptoms ...
If it's not the biggest indicator of if we are in stage 3 or not

The Great Chinese Famine (Chinese: 三年大饥荒, ""three years of famine"") was a period in the People's Republic of China between the years 1959 and 1961 (Great Leap Forward) characterized by widespread famine. The policies of ruler Mao Zedong contributed the most to the famine. Estimates of deaths due to starvation range in the tens of millions.

My understanding is that the new wards being made out of hotel rooms do not follow these standards and that Tokyo is starting to ignore the regulations due to the crisis. I still believe a lot of the ""4 days fever + recent travel"" regulations are being parroted by senior doctors/officials who are trying to protect hospitals, save face and maybe aren't keeping up with the research.

However, I will say that medical collapse is still very possible even when the rules are sidestepped. We have a lot of beds here but treating Coronavirus requires dedicated equipment like ventilators or artificial breathing machines. These aren't in high supply in hospitals so when officials talk about collapse, they mean that most ICUs are going to overflow and not be able to treat everyone. 1/5 people infected will need hospitalization. The disease is not fatal if they are treated properly (the 1-2% stat), but if hospitals overflow, then that treatment is unavailable and it's like that a good number of those people will die without it (10-20%)."

&#x200B;

Recently, some of the sailors on the aircraft carrier got sick with COVID-19. Capt Crozier begged the Navy to allow him to disembark (get off the ship) all of his sailors in order to stop the spread and keep them safe. The US Navy said no. He wrote a letter to US Navy leadership warning of the consequences and begging/demanding help and action. US Navy said no. The letter leaked, showing this Captain sticking up very strongly for his sailors, and speaking truth to power. Capt Crozier was fired/sacked. This is pretty much the worst thing that can happen to a military officer, especially a navy Captain.

&#x200B;

In case you didn't know, being a Captain in the navy is kind of a big deal, and especially a Captain of a goddamn US Navy aircraft carrier! He sacrificed his career for the men and women under him. This is a big deal. To someone in the lower ranks, this is pretty much unheard of.

&#x200B;

This made him a hero to the sailors of his ship.

&#x200B;

So as far as your statement ""everyone isn't supposed to be gathered in a massive crowd"" and similar comments on the YouTube video to which you linked: THAT'S THE WHOLE POINT.

&#x200B;

For anyone that HAS NOT been on a navy vessel (ship) before, and I'm going to assume that is most people reading this: it's impossible to social distance on a ship. Sickness spreads like wildfire x100. Being on a navy ship is like being locked in a tiny petri dish.

&#x200B;

The Captain knew if he didn't get his sailors off that ship, they would all get COVID-19. It was (now is?) inevitiable. There is no social distancing on a ship. There is no ""staying at home"". You have hundreds and hundreds of sailors packed together in a tin can.

&#x200B;

Telling these sailors stuck on a navy ship to social distance is like telling a person caught in a typhoon to dry off without moving. As long as they stay in the typhoon, that ain't happenin'.

2020-04-04,TrueIndologyBot,DDnews,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/DDnews/comments/furuxk/masks_do_reduce_spread_of_flu_and_some/fmec4id/,"**Summary:** 

In the study, the use of surgical masks by sufferers significantly reduced the number of flu viruses detectable in droplets released through breathing and coughing.
It also reduced the number of seasonal coronaviruses - among the causes of common colds - detectable in the air as suspended microdroplets, or aerosols. The study did not look at the new coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2.
“Further research is needed to determine whether masks can specifically prevent the transmission of SARS-CoV-2,” the scientists said.
The research, published in the journal Nature Medicine, coincides with the pandemic of COVID-19 respiratory disease, which has infected more than a million people worldwide and killed more than 53,000.
Benjamin Cowling, the professor who led the study at the World Health Organization (WHO) Collaborating Centre for infectious disease epidemiology in Hong Kong, said its findings could be extrapolated to simpler cotton masks.
“My expert view is that cloth or cotton masks would have an effect, but maybe slightly less of an effect than a surgical mask properly worn,” he said in a telephone interview. “And in terms of COVID-19, we’re looking at every possible measure that could help.”
Until now, there has been little robust scientific evidence on the effectiveness of face masks in slowing transmission of respiratory diseases.
The WHO says masks should be worn by anyone with symptoms such as cough or fever, or anyone caring for a confirmed or suspected COVID-19 case, but does not advise healthy people to wear them in everyday situations.
There is some evidence, however, to suggest that the rapid spread of the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus is due at least in part to the fact that it can be transmitted by people showing no symptoms.
upert Beale, a specialist in infection biology at London’s Francis Crick Institute who was not directly involved in Cowling’s work, said the study offered “strong and compelling evidence” for mask wearing as a means of reducing transmission of some viruses, but that they were not a magic bullet.
“Mask wearing does not completely prevent transmission and cannot be relied on as a sole measure,” he said, “but, combined with other social distancing measures, should form part of the ‘exit strategy’ from lockdown”."
2020-04-04,TrueIndologyBot,DDnews,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/DDnews/comments/furviu/coronavirus_could_trigger_biggest_fall_in_carbon/fmec6fz/,"**Summary:** 

Rob Jackson, who chairs the Global Carbon Project, which produces widely-watched annual emissions estimates, said carbon output could fall by more than 5% year-on-year - the first dip since a 1.4% reduction after the 2008 financial crisis.
“I wouldn’t be shocked to see a 5% or more drop in carbon dioxide emissions this year, something not seen since the end of World War Two,” Jackson, a professor of Earth system science at Stanford University in California said.
“Neither the fall of the Soviet Union nor the various oil or savings and loan crises of the past 50 years are likely to have affected emissions the way this crisis is,” he said.
The prediction – among a range of new forecasts being produced by climate researchers - represents a tiny sliver of good news in the midst of crisis: Climate scientists had warned world governments that global emissions must start dropping by 2020 to avoid the worst impacts of climate change.
Experts warn that without structural change, the emissions declines caused by coronavirus could be short-lived and have little impact on the concentrations of carbon dioxide that have accumulated in the atmosphere over decades.
“This drop is not due to structural changes so as soon as confinement ends, I expect the emissions will go back close to where they were,” said Corinne Le Quéré, a climate scientist at the University of East Anglia in eastern England."

2020-04-04,LongjumpingHurry,TheMotte,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/fscavf/coronavirus_quarantine_thread_week_4/fmea2jh/,"re: not putting a price on human life: I wonder why Cuomo (or any of his re-tweeters) thinks we've never used social distancing or lockdowns in previous years to save lives from the flu (and other infectious disease). (Indeed, didn't Cuomo delay the *current* countermeasures a day or two, and weren't at least a few deaths 100% predictable at the time?)

I'm not sure I get the comparison to philanthropy. Like, I don't know that we'd be doing any social distancing to ease some *other* country's distress. (Why not use the domestic dollars/QALY numbers you reference? We already know (or at least I'm assuming) that they exceed the value we put on lives saved through philanthropy—coronavirus need not been invoked to make that point.)

In the alternative world in which the worlds' governments took no action, present and future behavior would still change, just from the bottom up, and possibly change quite drastically nonetheless. Seems like it's the difference between these two scenarios, government action and inaction, that's most relevant? I suppose you might make the same argument if the bottom-up behavior was equally disproportionate in its economic and social impact.

Is that mortality rate based on the availability of medical care? I'd assume that most of the people who die in the hospital will still die outside the hospital, and a good chunk of the ICU patients and 20-40% (?) of the ventilator patients would die outside a hospital. (Maybe it balances out with the generous 100% infection assumption?)

Lastly... WTF is up with that Lancet article's numeric font? The decimal points so *high*?! And the numbers are all wonky? I seriously can't read it. I'd suspect it's somehow in my head, but I'm not having trouble reading anything else at the moment."

    Sweden threatens to report France for wearing masks

    When countries introduce export stops on health equipment, it is a problem for the whole world, the Swedish minister believes.

    Sweden is considering reporting France to the European Commission for breach of the internal market rules. That's because a shipment of four million face masks from China to the Swedish-based company Mölnlycke has been stopped in France.

    This is what Friday's Minister of Commerce Anna Hallberg (S) says.

    ""It may be time to put the heavy artillery into operation,"" she says.

    Many countries have set export restrictions on critical health equipment within the EU. Both Foreign Minister Ann Linde (S) and Anna Hallberg see it as very serious.

    ""Now is the time to contact France again,"" says Anna Hallberg.

    Several countries have restrictions on the export of equipment But if dialogue cannot solve problems, there is also an opportunity to report it as a rule violation. Hallberg believes that the problem is that if all countries do like France, it will go beyond everyone.

    »It is extremely disturbing. There is nothing that we send to France that we can send out of the country, ""Mölnlycke's CEO Richard Twomey told Swedish Radio.

    The shipment was stopped on 5 March and should have been brought to Spain and Italy, among others.

    Both Spain, Italy and France are particularly hard hit by coronavirus and have reported high death rates due to covid-19 in recent days. However, it is not only France that has the type of restrictions on the export of critical health equipment. Hungary, the Czech Republic, Poland, Romania, Spain, Italy and Slovakia have also done something similar. And outside Europe, President Donald Trump has ordered an export stop for approved masks and other coronavirus protective equipment on Saturday night in the US."

The   need to create this platform completely free of charge and without   advertising was born for the absence of a portal that would allow to   compare the graphs and time trends between the various countries.

Take a look at it and if you like, make it known to your friends and relatives:

Daily   information on the Coronavirus pandemic (Covid-19) in Italy and around   the world. On the site you can find all relevant data and compare them   nationally (between regions) or worldwide (between states):

The Prime Minister said, people are at home during lockdown, but they are not alone as collective strength of entire country is with each one of them.
 
PM Modi also said, the way people paid gratitude to those fighting against COVID-19 on 22nd of last month has become a model that is being emulated by other countries. He added that Janata Curfew and ringing of bells have made people of the country aware of their unity amid this challenging time."

They've been actively combating it since fucking January, with extreme success.

Do you know how many people have died of it in Taiwan? 5.

Not 5 a day, 5 ever. They've shown consistency and efficacy since day 1 but suuuuuuuure the virus is just chilling, waiting around until it can finally strike.

That's not how it works you bellend. The virus dies if it can't spread, and with the measures they've put in place, we know for a fact it's not spreading, don't we? Why yes, yes we do because other places have a thousand dead a day and four months in Taiwan has had 5 total."

Xi government was awful, had 6 weeks to correct it on its onset...  


I think while Xi government needs to be held accountable, (he won't be, the Hubei/Wuhan gov. is being thrown under the bus), the larger issue is the deference to the economy and market.  Unfortunately, the US hasn't been much of a moral leader over the past 70 years to where we can convincingly say we would have done anything differently.  


In the end, it is the people of the world who must pay the price for global neo-liberalism. But yes some material consequence would feel justified instead of having to stay in the realm of the abstract and theoretical, if not for the workers and citizens of china who were made to work through the start of the epidemic (Trump's response doesn't much vary.)   


That said China is in no place to gloat either.  They want to laugh at Americans for not having masks while also sending out faulty test kits and masks to other countries?  


1. All the daigo (black-market traders of goods) bought up the American masks, shipped them to china to sell at a premium price on places such as wechat.  

2. The argument that it was actually citizens and family members sending back supplies doesn't hold up, [as there is evidence to the contrary](https://www.scmp.com/news/china/society/article/3048512/china-red-cross-under-fire-poor-delivery-coronavirus-supplies) that the ""Red Cross Society"" supported by the official party actually confiscated much of these type of packages as everything had to be redistributed through government channels (the sole savior obvsly).
3. Celebrating the demise of other countries, while boasting about your own performance, while your own government silenced the doctors who alerted the public of a new virus looks foolish.

But yes US/UK totally fucked it up, but America's healthcare and social infrastructure is so shit it goes beyond Trump and his leadership."

In January, Trump was getting together a task force to look into the coronavirus.  The media was downplaying it and claiming the flu was much worse (Fox News being the only major exception there).  Congress was completely ignoring it in favor of impeaching the only American politician doing something about it.

In February, Donald Trump brought the corovirus into the public eye during the state of the union.  He banned travel from China, which he was called racist for.  The press parroted the lies of the Chinese government, because they never ran people over with tanks or anything else wrong.  Democrats, particularly Bill De Blasio and Nancy Pelosi encouraged public gathering while President Trump was warning that we might need to take precautions against the outbreak.  While Trump was trying to stop the outbreak, Democrats encouraged things that spread it.  But keep telling me Trump is evil.

In March, we are under quarantine because of the negligence and failure of Democrats to protect us from China's deceed and gross mismanagement.  Trump has done everything in his power to protect us.  He has gotten us tests that get results in 12 minutes, making us more effective at testing for the virus than any other country.  He pushed forward a chloroquine treatment that has yielded impressively positive results (one test group of 699 even had a 100% recovery rate).

The reason the Left and the media continue to slander the President and refuse to give him credit where credit is due is because your life is meaningless to them.  If you die of this outbreak, they won't care.  Trump, however, clearly does care and has made efforts to protect us all.  And yes, you can blame me for voting for that hero."

>In light of this new evidence, CDC recommends wearing cloth face coverings in public settings where other social distancing measures are difficult to maintain (e.g., grocery stores and pharmacies) **especially** in areas of significant community-based transmission.

The CDC was already planning to change its guidelines since last week at least. ([It was leaked](https://twitter.com/CDCgov/status/12439473137159618)). But they waited a full week until Friday evening, so they could 'dump' it at a time when the fewest people were paying attention, so no one would call them on delaying this step for two months.

>  По словам Ван Гухта, у котов и людей на поверхности дыхательных клеток имеется похожая «дверная ручка», которая позволяет вирусу SARS-CoV-2 проникнуть внутрь.
> 
>  Ученые выяснили, что у людей вирус SARS-CoV-2 прикрепляется к рецепторному белку, называемому ACE2, который находится снаружи дыхательных клеток. Оказавшись внутри этих клеток, вирус захватывает определенные механизмы, чтобы он мог размножаться.

Собака умерла в середине марта, хотя точная причина смерти неизвестна, поскольку владелец не позволил вскрытие. Издание [Bloomberg сообщило](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-03-19/second-dog-in-hong-kong-tests-positive-for-covid-19-virus), что вторая собака, немецкая овчарка, показала положительный результат, но у нее не было симптомов заболевания.

> 
>  «Мы считаем, что кошка является побочной жертвой существующей эпидемии среди людей и не играет важной роли в распространении вируса», — сказал он.
> 
>  По словам Ван Гухта, чтобы окончательно доказать, что кошка была заражена вирусом SARS-CoV-2, ученым потребуется анализ крови на наличие антител, специфичных к этому вирусу. Эти тесты проведут, когда кошка больше не будет находиться на карантине."

March 26: “They have to go back to work; our country has to go back. Our country is based on that, and I think it’s going to happen pretty quickly.”

And Trump can and should end them at any time.

> Providing ID to stop dead people from voting

Or you could just look up public records for a list of dead people and remove them automatically.  But of course, this has nothing to do with removing dead people from the rolls, and everything to do with removing living voters from the rolls using the possibility of death as an excuse.

> This virus has done nothing compared to the millions of lives affected by shutting down everything 

That's like saying, ""The cost we spend on treating measles outbreaks is less than the cost of vaccinating people.""  Yeah, that's sort of the goal.

>Trump implemented the travel ban while everyone gave him shit for it. 

The criticism of the travel ban was that it was a band-aid solution that ignored the bigger picture.  It's like blowing out a candle when your house is on fire.

China already started restricting outside flights, the ban didn't apply to US citizens coming back from China, the virus was already in the US, and it was already coming in from non-China countries.

> Obama couldn’t have prevented the coronavirus.

The purpose of the program was specifically included tracking emerging novel coronaviruses in places like Wuhan so that they could be addressed and contained early on, rather than waiting for an uncontrolled outbreak.

>$200 million dollars is not a cure for a virus.

It's enough for containment and early detection.

> He’s donated every presidential paycheck to government programs. 

And he's spent a hundred times that amount at his own businesses on the tax payer dime.

>H1N1 reached 60M cases in the US. We still went to work/school everyday. 

 **Trump, March 4:** *And that went from around April of ’09 to April of ’10, where there were 60 million cases of swine flu. And over — actually, it’s over 13,000. I think you might have said 17. I had heard it was 13, but a lot of — a lot of deaths.*

We're now at 7,000 deaths from only 280,000 cases, and that's *with* the closure of school.  And the vast majority of those are brand new cases, which means many more of them will die in the near future.

What do you think is going to happen if we reach 60,000,000 cases?  Do you think that the death count will be more or less than the 13,000 he criticized Obama for?"

2020-04-04,Arkdload,Capitalism,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Capitalism/comments/ftyyud/capitalism_people_are_rational_actors_people_hold/fmdr2af/,"I find bringing up the time and circumstances regarding when the constitution was written to be a particularly weak argument due to the fact that it was designed to be absolute. I see no reason that even a crisis should change normal societal values regarding the individual's relationship with authority, especially when protecting the precedent of rights to avoid future abuse. Relying solely on the state's transparency to interpret your rights for you instead of having them be enforced and regarded as sacred leaves you open for nasty surprises. Contrary to popular belief, slippery slopes do exist, it happened in Germany, and I see no reason it can't happen here. While the crisis circumstances in Germany were significantly different in the 20s and 30s, the attitudes of the people were quite the same. Also, as for past precedence, the coronavirus outbreak is very irregular, at no point during the Spanish Flu epidemic, or others; SARS, MERS, Ebola - were regulations like these ever considered. I also find it means little to nothing, objectively, to bring up germ theory here. 

On the matter of the moral stranglehold involving the masks, I am aware of how much of a necessity they are, however, price gouging lawsuits or a mass state orders for provisions, like what occurred under the recent stimulus deal, suffice without putting people in danger of over-regulation. There's something to be said for the financial ability of the United States to handle these strains without raiding its' citizens homes.

That being said, I would caution you to avoid creating an apocalyptic scenario that simply doesn't exist, the total, and fairly geographically consistent, death rate per case is less than 3%. This isn't about survival for most people, it's about the economic and social impact attitudes that make it seem like survival cause. Some do require major medical assistance to breathe and putting health officials at risk is a necessary travesty, but a social construct is should be upheld as long as society exists. You're taking what I'm saying and putting it in a vacuum where the very essential of human psychology that birthed the construct of property rights is turned on its head and regressed in a fashion that could only exist if humanity just started over from the stone age. Not to mention the fact that nobody argued for the NAP, we're here under the assumption that the United States is still a functioning nation.

You and I are certainly going to have to disagree on the right of the government to preserve life, while a noble concept in theory, forced altruism often leads to moral conflicts that defeat the purpose of an attempt to preserve life. It isn't so much a right as a privilege, here, I would say, is an instance in which they crossed the line. The state is not a moral guide for an individual, every individual is a sovereign entity with their own philosophical, political, or otherwise moral and opinionated leanings. For us to assume that the government should be able to utilize moral authority in such a fashion, then we would also have to assume that they should be able to defy republican principles, which is heretical at best. While I would agree that no individual has the inherent right to exploit another person, from a logical standpoint, there are some times when retribution, even of this scale, can cause more damage than good in the long term if it becomes routine."

Trump says he will fire intelligence watchdog at center of Ukraine allegations that led to impeachment
By 
Ellen Nakashima, 
Josh Dawsey and 
Shane Harris 
April 3, 2020 at 7:49 p.m. PDT

President Trump notified Congress Friday evening that he intends in 30 days to fire the intelligence community inspector general, the official who alerted lawmakers to a whistleblower complaint last September that was at the center of allegations that led to the president’s impeachment.

The bombshell move to remove Michael Atkinson comes as the administration is struggling to cope with a coronavirus pandemic that has killed thousands of Americans.

The whistleblower complaint centered on Trump’s efforts last summer to pressure the Ukrainian government to undertake investigations of former vice president Joe Biden and his son Hunter, moves that would undermine a likely rival to Trump in his reelection bid.

AD

Trump informed lawmakers in a letter late Friday night that he was removing Atkinson. “It is vital that I have the fullest confidence in the appointees serving as inspectors general,’’ he wrote in the letter, a copy of which was obtained by The Washington Post. “That is no longer the case with regard to this inspector general.”

Trump has faulted Atkinson repeatedly for letting the complaint reach Congress and also as enabling what he has called a “hoax” of an impeachment, administration officials said.

He has weighed for months removing Atkinson, whom he picked for the job in late 2017, but has been periodically talked out of it.

The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment about the reason for or the timing of the firing. Trump’s action drew immediate condemnation from senior Democratic lawmakers.

AD
“Whether it’s Lt. Col. Vindman, Captain Crozier, or Intelligence Community Inspector General Michael Atkinson: President Trump fires people for telling the truth,” Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) said in a statement. “Michael Atkinson is a man of integrity who has served our nation for almost two decades. Being fired for having the courage to speak truth to power makes him a patriot.”

Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman was a Ukraine specialist on the White House National Security Council who testified during the House impeachment about listening in to Trump’s telephone conversation with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. He was removed from his White House post days after Trump’s acquittal by the Senate.

Capt. Brett Crozier was the commander of the aircraft carrier USS Theodore Roosevelt who was removed after the leaking of a blunt letter he wrote to his superiors about what he saw as insufficient measures to fight a coronavirus outbreak aboard the vessel.

AD
“In the midst of a national emergency, it is unconscionable that the president is once again attempting to undermine the integrity of the intelligence community by firing yet another intelligence official simply for doing his job,” said Senate Intelligence Committee Vice Chairman Mark R. Warner (D-Va.). “We should all be deeply disturbed by ongoing attempts to politicize the nation’s intelligence agencies.”

House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam B. Schiff (D-Calif.) called the move “yet another blatant attempt by the president to gut the independence of the intelligence community and retaliate against those who dare to expose presidential wrongdoing.” Said Schiff: “At a time when our country is dealing with a national emergency and needs people in the intelligence community to speak truth to power, the president’s dead of night decision puts our country and national security at even greater risk.”

Atkinson, a respected government lawyer with more than 20 years’ experience, was informed Friday night that Trump intended to fire him and was placed on administrative leave effective immediately, according to a congressional aide who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak for the record. The statute technically requires that both intelligence committees be notified by the president 30 days before the effective date of the inspector general’s removal. But placing Atkinson on administrative leave effectively sidelines him immediately, the aide said.

AD
“The firing of Atkinson, who was appointed by President Trump, is nothing but a delayed retaliatory action taken against an independent IG for his proper handling of a whistleblower complaint,” said Mark Zaid, the lawyer who previously represented the intelligence community employee who alleged that Trump had solicited Ukraine’s interference in the 2020 presidential election. “This action is disgraceful and undermines the integrity of the whistleblower system,” Zaid said. “It is time GOP members of the Senate stand up for the rule of law and speak out against this president.”

So why don’t we?
Yes the well-intentioned doctors Al
Dr. Zelenko Was right to add zinc (though it is not clear how much and what form is best).

The only disappointment I find is not trying it as a replacement to the antibiotic which is dangerous and not called for except in extreme cases.

Another example of poor FDA guidance for doctors, leaving them to be creative, which beats being helpless if careful. 

He just a doctor not a clinic which can do a controlled study.

There is evidence that zinc in the system even without supplementation might be enough to enter the attacked cell thanks to hydroxychloroquine.

This is backed up and explained by searching for coronavirus update 34 and viewing The video starting at minute 5:50.

All kinds of ways to get zinc into the cell and interfere with virus replication without using drugs including ionophore quercetin.

Zinc is really being overlooked here and it can be formulated in gargles sprays lozenges perhaps in combination with a ionophore or even low-dose hydroxychloroquine.

Aren’t we all brilliant?

our psyches and our economies cannot afford to wait around for rocksolid proof, hoping some exotic new or old drug might work and might be available in weeks or vaccines in months.

And this virus isn’t going to disappear just because everybody stays home… We need to give the public our State of the art, best practices, potential and known immunity building techniques.

Armed with that and knowledge that some drug cocktails and natural supplements like zinc will be available if they start to get very sick, we can return in waves to a normal life much sooner and with more confidence. 

Please ask the powerful to shoot the zinc bullet at the balls of this virus to likely optimize hydroxychloroquine."

Not really. The difference is that these issues were dealt with. 

E.g. the German export ban was [lifted weeks ago](https://www.spiegel.de/wirtschaft/soziales/coronavirus-bundesregierung-hebt-eu-exportverbot-fuer-schutzkleidung-auf-a-da32256c-bf75-421b-89d9-3bb6820e4dda) (and was for the most part only in effect for a week). It also only was only about requiring licenses for export. Those were granted for exports to Italy. 

There also were issues with some EU states (Poland and Czechia) stopping deliveries to Italy. But those got replaced by these countries.   

It's a crisis. People making rash decisions isn't something we can prevent. But they should not get through with it."

Washington Post, 16 Feb: [Tom Cotton keeps repeating a coronavirus conspiracy theory that was already debunked](http://archive.is/w77Aa)

Washington Post, 2 April: [How did covid-19 begin? Its initial origin story is shaky.](http://archive.is/OY9sV)

The first article attacks a strawman. It rightly dismisses the idea that this virus is an engineered bioweapon, but does not address the chance of a safety breach during routine lab work.

The second article attacks Tom Cotton using the same arguments above, but does not actually refute him. Cotton is not claiming the virus is an engineered bioweapon, but raising the point that we have to consider the chance that the virus that is thought to have originated from a Wuhan food market may have originated from a Wuhan virology lab that studies human infectious diseases. 

Finally, two months later, the Post publishes an opinion piece sympathetic to Cotton's views without any straw-manning. Finally we get ""scientists don’t rule out that an accident at a research laboratory in Wuhan might have spread a deadly bat virus that had been collected for scientific study.""

We can even compare quotes given by the same expert. In January we get:

>“Based on the virus genome and properties there is no indication whatsoever that it was an engineered virus,” said Richard Ebright

but only in the April article do we get the following:

>But Ebright cautioned that it “also could have occurred as a laboratory accident, with, for example, an accidental infection of a laboratory worker.” He noted that bat coronaviruses were studied in Wuhan at Biosafety Level 2, “which provides only minimal protection,” compared with the top BSL-4.

------


I don't really know what my point is. This was prompted by reading the April article and deciding to compare it to what the Post previously wrote. Was the conflation of ""engineered bioweapon"" vs ""safety lapse"" on purpose? Is labelling something a conspiracy theory a super-weapon? In areas of epistemological uncertainty, nothing really can be ""debunked"" as journalists are wont to do. Yet anything other than the Establishment theory is a conspiracy. In another few months, will it be the Establishment position to doubt that the virus originated from a Wuhan food market?"

> There is another working theory that susceptibility to COVID-19 has to do with tubercolosis vaccinations. TB vaccines are called BCG, as derived from the bacterium Mycobacterium bovis. What it does is that it modulates the body's immune response to the tubercolosis infection.

> If you check a map of BCG/TB vaccination policies:

> https://i.imgur.com/nqRPc9J.jpg

> You'll find that Western Europe and North America no longer practices on-going mass vaccination programs against TB, and instead only does them on a selective basis. This coincides with the rapid spread of COVID-19 in these regions, as we've seen in the last two weeks, and contrasts with the rest of the world, which has seen a much slower spread of the disease.

> https://i.imgur.com/rVrSdAx.png

> There is a correlation between Iran, Korea, and Japan suffering particularly deadly outbreaks with their use of the Pasteur and Danish versions of the BCG vaccine.

> This is in contrast with Eastern European countries, African countries, South American countries, India, and Turkey, all using the Russian strains of the BCG vaccine, with their relative low rates of death and serious illness.

> This traces back to COVID-19 specifically, and coronaviruses in general, because what kills people is the Cytokine storm, a feedback loop where cells in the upper respiratory tract are killed by the virus, fall into the lungs, cause inflammation, trigger an immune response, and the immune response damages the lungs and the rest of the body even further, which causes even more cell death, and so on.

> So, not only is there theoretically a link between active BCG vaccination, but also that the specific strain of the BCG vaccine used matters insofar as the Pasteur and Danish strains, which are the strongest/most powerful strains of the vaccine (ergo, those that trigger the strongest cytokine reactions), are being used in the countries that have seen the most deaths, whereas countries that have seen relatively few deaths are using much milder BCG vaccine strains.

I will admit that I was wrong on:

* Korea suffering badly from COVID-19 - their response to the crisis was quick and overwhelming enough that they were able to get it well under control
* Turkey avoiding COVID-19 - they simply hadn't entered their outbreak period yet when I wrote this, and their response has been so ineffective that the virus is particularly bad there

However, I bring this up because The New York Times ran this article today: [How an Old Tuberculosis Vaccine Might Help Fight the New Coronavirus](https://www.nytimes.com/reuters/2020/04/02/us/02reuters-health-coronavirus-tbvaccine-explainer.html)

> There is no vaccine against the novel coronavirus, called SARS-CoV-2, that is spreading rapidly around the world. But scientists in several countries are testing a century-old tuberculosis (TB) vaccine to see if it might boost the immune system to reduce respiratory symptoms in people who get new coronavirus infections.

> Researchers in Australia and Europe are testing whether the Bacille Calmette-Guerin (BCG) vaccine, introduced in the 1920s to fight tuberculosis, might be deployed to combat COVID-19, the respiratory disease caused by the novel coronavirus."

Rob Jackson, who chairs the Global Carbon Project, which produces widely-watched annual emissions estimates, said carbon output could fall by more than 5% year-on-year - the first dip since a 1.4% reduction after the 2008 financial crisis.
“I wouldn’t be shocked to see a 5% or more drop in carbon dioxide emissions this year, something not seen since the end of World War Two,” Jackson, a professor of Earth system science at Stanford University in California said.
“Neither the fall of the Soviet Union nor the various oil or savings and loan crises of the past 50 years are likely to have affected emissions the way this crisis is,” he said.
The prediction – among a range of new forecasts being produced by climate researchers - represents a tiny sliver of good news in the midst of crisis: Climate scientists had warned world governments that global emissions must start dropping by 2020 to avoid the worst impacts of climate change.
Experts warn that without structural change, the emissions declines caused by coronavirus could be short-lived and have little impact on the concentrations of carbon dioxide that have accumulated in the atmosphere over decades.
“This drop is not due to structural changes so as soon as confinement ends, I expect the emissions will go back close to where they were,” said Corinne Le Quéré, a climate scientist at the University of East Anglia in eastern England."

Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti announced Monday that landlords would not be allowed to increase the rent for hundreds of thousands of apartments in the city, in his latest effort to ease the financial hardship on Angelenos from the coronavirus outbreak.

“Rent will stay the same,” the mayor said during a briefing on Monday afternoon. “This is a common sense action on top of the eviction moratorium that will help folks stay in their homes and make ends meet.”

The announcement covers about 624,000 apartments that fall under the city’s rent stabilization program, according to city statistics. Normally, that program allows owners of apartment buildings built on or before October 1978 to increase rents by about 3% or 4% every year. Single-family rentals and most newer apartments, neither of which [are ](https://www.latimes.com/politics/la-pol-ca-rent-control-impacts-20181003-story.html)[subject to rent control under state law](https://www.latimes.com/politics/la-pol-ca-rent-control-impacts-20181003-story.html), will remain unaffected by Garcetti’s executive order.

The freeze on rent increases covers the vast majority of apartments in L.A. and will last until the city’s state of emergency over the COVID-19 pandemic ends, Garcetti said. Any rent increases planned for April 1 at apartments covered by the order are void, a Garcetti spokesman confirmed.

The mayor’s action adds yet another layer of protection for tenants, many of whom have rent due on Wednesday.

On Friday, the L.A. City Council [approved a temporary ban on evictions](https://www.latimes.com/homeless-housing/story/2020-03-27/coronavirus-newsom-eviction-ban-california) for renters who are unable to pay rent because of the virus. The council also waived late fees and allowed renters to make up late payments for up to a year after the expiration of the emergency order. Council members, however, rejected a blanket ban on all evictions during the pandemic, and all back rent must still be paid.

Councilman Mike Bonin, who represents Venice and several other Westside neighborhoods and had been pushing for a halt on rent hikes, said he was thrilled by the mayor’s decision.

“This is a big and important and necessary step to prevent people from winding up on the streets,” he said.

Bonin said he and Councilman David Ryu would continue to press Gov. Gavin Newsom and the Trump administration for a more complete stoppage on rent increases, a suspension of rent and mortgage payments and other relief measures for tenants and homeowners.

Garcetti’s decision troubled Daniel Yukelson, executive director of the Apartment Assn. of Greater Los Angeles. He was concerned that landlords who were counting on rent increases to pay their mortgages, property taxes and other bills now had to forgo that revenue.

City leaders “are just forcing this entire burden on rental property owners,” Yukelson said. “They’re going to put a lot of owners out of business. There are many owners that live month to month and depend on these rent checks to survive.”

Some tenant advocates said the mayor’s action will be helpful, but still wasn’t enough to ensure that renters are protected from evictions in the future, as they continue to grapple with the economic ripples of the pandemic.

“It’s great that tenants won’t receive a rent increase,” said Trinidad Ruiz, an organizer with Los Angeles Tenants Union, one of several groups that protested outside Garcetti’s home Sunday afternoon. “But that won’t protect them as soon as this eviction pause is lifted.”"

The painting “Lentetuin”, or “Spring Garden,” which dates back to 1884 and depicts the garden of the rectory at Nuenen, had been on loan from the Groninger Museum.
“I feel incredibly angry and now I’m starting to feel sadder too,” Jan Rudolph de Lorm, director of the Singer Laren Museum, told Reuters in an interview.
He appealed to those who had taken the painting to treat it with care “so that sooner or later it can be shown to the public unharmed”.
Van Gogh, who struggled with mental illness throughout his life, was staying with his parents when he painted “Spring Garden”. His father worked as a minister in Nuenen.
De Lorm described the painting, which depicts a woman in a garden with red-flowered bushes and with a church in the background, as “an image of silence, of reflection and of tranquility, which undoubtedly offered him comfort and inspiration”.
“Through him, it gave us and our audience the same emotion,” de Lorm added.

The museum, located in the town of Laren to the east of Amsterdam, has appealed for the swift return of the painting, which has been added to Interpol’s list of stolen artworks.
In a statement, police said the thieves had entered the museum by breaking its glass doors at around 3.15 a.m. (0115 GMT). “The culprits were gone by the time police responded to the alarm,” the statement said.
Investigators are searching for security footage and witnesses, and are examining forensic evidence, it added.
Dutch museums have been closed because of the coronavirus outbreak since March 12.

The App, called ‘AarogyaSetu’ joins Digital India for the health and well-being of every Indian. The App will enable people to assess themselves the risk for their catching the Coronavirus infection.
It will calculate this based on their interaction with others, using cutting edge Bluetooth technology, algorithms and artificial intelligence.
Once installed in a smartphone through an easy and user-friendly process, the app detects other devices with Aarogya Setu installed that come in the proximity of that phone.
The app can then calculate the risk of infection based on sophisticated parameters if any of these contacts is tested positive.
The App will help the Government take necessary timely steps for assessing risk of spread of COVID-19 infection, and ensuring isolation where required.
The App’s design ensures privacy-first. The personal data collected by the App is encrypted using state-of-the-art technology and stays secure on the phone till it is needed for facilitating medical intervention.
Available in 11 languages, the App is ready for pan-India use from day-1 and has highly scalable architecture. This app is a unique example of the nation’s young talent coming together and pooling resources and efforts to respond to a global crisis. 
It is at once a bridge between public and private sectors, digital technology and health services delivery and the potential of young India with a disease-free and healthy future of the nation. "

Thus should be repeated for current corona virus, to see whether the previous prediction still apply.

Hotter temperature denature / break protein up (this is already experimented and proven again and again thus we called it theory). Virus is genetic material coated with protein. The protein in coronavirus resembles a crown hence the name (corona = crown).

However, to denature the protein, the temperature must be high enough, and i doubt room / outside temperature is sufficient.

Something akin to knowing where riots are happening in a city and knowingly diverting traffic directly into the worst areas for people trying to flee. Something something public safety.

Or maybe have the FDA do some serious flexing and make every single time Trump or announcer tout the virtues of the new snakeoil coronavirus cure, a *strong* overlay which reads ""Not verified by the Surgeon General...."" 

You know what, the whole fucking empire needs to go. Fox *has* caused demonstrable loss of life through their direct speeches and programs. 

If medical science has been Lebowski'd (”that's, just, like, your opinion, man) and it can be proven that Fox knowingly encouraged listeners to regard an exact falsehood as fact, leading to the death of citizens, how could that *not* be regarded as a true Enemy of the State?

It's directly killing citizens through known misinformation dissemination! 

And for a final thought, if that enemy of the state is not even forced to endure even a symbolic gesture of remonstation, what does that tell citizens about the true nature of the State?

Tl;Dr We in a fascistic dictator state, y'all. The only truth here is that the current batch of politicians ain't so good about keeping it a secret.

And, one could argue the urgent and imminent need to have a judge to an emergency hearing on the matter. 

Additionally, for anyone that might suggest avoiding pulling Fox from the airwaves,"

Paper title: 

* *Anonymous Collocation Discovery: Harnessing Privacy to Tame the Coronavirus*

Version 1 published 2020-03-30; version 3 dated 2020-04-03; …

### Note

> To avoid confusion, we stress that this work does not propose any direct medical treatment. Rather, it proposes a way to pool together information from the community in order to help (a) direct medical personnel in how to best allocate and use testing resources, and (b) direct individuals as to when to get tested and self-quarantine.

### Abstract

> Successful containment of the Coronavirus pandemic rests on the ability to quickly and reliably identify those who have been in close proximity to a contagious individual. Existing tools for doing so rely on the collection of exact location information of individuals over lengthy time periods, and combining this information with other personal information. This unprecedented encroachment on individual privacy at national scales has created an outcry and risks rejection of these tools.
> 
> We propose an alternative: an extremely simple scheme for providing fine-grained and timely alerts to users who have been in the close vicinity of an infected individual. Crucially, this is done while preserving the anonymity of all individuals, and without collecting or storing any personal information or location history. Our approach is based on using short-range communication mechanisms, like Bluetooth, that are available in all modern cell phones. It can be deployed with very little infrastructure, and incurs a relatively low false-positive rate compared to other collocation methods. We also describe a number of extensions and tradeoffs.
> 
> We believe that the privacy guarantees provided by the scheme will encourage quick and broad voluntary adoption. When combined with sufficient testing capacity and existing best practices from healthcare professionals, we hope that this may significantly reduce the infection rate."

First, the entire genome has been sequenced for this virus from numerous clinical isolates. These isolates display none of the signature mutations of other bat-derived coronaviruses that are in cloning vectors. Second, this virus displays very high sequence similarity to bat coronaviruses and to pangolin coronaviruses. These viruses have somewhat promiscuous cell surface receptor specificity and, most importantly, and absolutely ridiculously high rate of RNA RECOMBINATION because the RDRP can facilitate discontinuous transcription. Meaning that it’s likely that the origin of the virus came from close proximity of these bats and pangolins in an area with high human traffic. You know... like the markets. It literally couldn’t come from a lab because those two types of coronavirus simply would never be in the same dish. Finally, studies show that clinical isolates lose the furin-like proteolysis motif between the s1 and s2 domain of the spike protein within 4 passages within cell cultures. So even if you were able to get them in the same dish to induce the recombination it would lose the thing that makes it so infectious. Meaning that unless it was specifically engineered and released that it could not have accidentally escaped a lab in this format. And even then it would be challenging to grow this virus up.

The Bolshoi, which closed on March 17 until April 10, joins a string of other Russian theaters, opera houses and museums that have turned to online streaming to satisfy Russians’ cultural needs during the coronavirus lockdown.
Russia has so far recorded 1,036 cases of the virus and five related deaths, and has stepped up measures to curb its spread. This weekend Moscow will shutter all cafes, restaurants and shops apart from those selling food and medicine.
The Bolshoi’s ballet dancers are having to get used to training and keeping in shape at home.
“Of course it’s a very difficult time for us,” Denis Rodkin, a principal dancer, told Reuters on Friday. “We really depend on our profession... I hope that this will not last long and everything will be up and running again soon.”
In the meantime, Rodkin said, the performances streamed online might help keep people’s spirits up while they are confined to their homes.
“Art, and the Bolshoi Theater’s broadcasts in particular, support people in these difficult conditions,” he said. “They will be inspired, recharged with art, and all this will end.”
Ballet soloist Ksenia Zhiganshina also put a brave face on the enforced closure of the theater and its impact on the dancers.

That's harder done than said, because what you can do is very limited as you must keep your distance from people and be careful of the things you touch. Also there's the potential you could make things worse by making people sick

Maybe ring people up and stay in contact with people? Maybe volunteer for a mental health helpline? (Although you probably have to have qualifications) 

You are far more likely to win people's respect, and therefore maybe win an opportunity to share Christ with someone, through respectable actions in this time - rather than impersonally warning about the end times

In any event - Jesus said there would be pestilences, and this would be business as usual (Mat. 24). Yes they are signs, yes we are getting closer to the tribulation, yes this event is being used by God to get us spiritually ready; 

But if we are to use the Coronavirus to point anybody to anything in the Bible, it must be that Jesus said that these things would happen, but the end is not yet"

I will say that self awareness means nothing if you're looking only for validation and not to try to improve yourself. I can feel guilty all day about something I feel, but it means nothing if I don't do something about it. And guess what? The rule of not policing applies to you too. Please don't police how other people feel trauma either. If something you did reminded them of their trauma, then you shouldn't be telling them to take that elsewhere.

I feel like the current culture of constantly needing validity for every single one of your feelings and getting hurt when someone tells you ""hey, that's not so great, I know you've been through a lot but it makes people uncomfortable"" is quite harmful.

And yes, **I do have issues with empathy as well**. Very serious ones. I, myself, struggle to empathize with people who are scared. For the first month, all I could care about was my job. One of my friends came to me terrified because his parents had the coronavirus and he didn't want to catch it, and all I could muster was ""that sucks, lots of things could be worse though."" Guess what? It hurt his feelings and made HIM feel invalidated. Was that the time for me to say ""oh, I can't help it, I have no empathy."" Not at all! I apologized and analyzed my feelings, and decided to let him know that it wasn't something I was capable of handling, and instead to go to someone different. I've been working for years to cultivate this compassion.

Listen, I get it. I know how it feels. Venting is valid. You and I are \~valid\~. But just like you have a right to your feelings, people have a right to theirs.

Perhaps I've got this place wrong. Perhaps it's purely a safe space, which doesn't have to be a bad thing. However, that means it's a safe space for other opinions and reactions, including ones that go against yours. It seems you still have a lot of trauma and emotions to work through, so I wish you luck on your recovery."

In a video message Sunday morning, the Prime Minister said people should maintain social distancing, stay indoors and not form groups while lighting up lamps.
 
PM Modi said, people displayed unprecedented discipline and sense of service during the ongoing nationwide coronavirus lockdown. PM said, the country has to move towards light from the darkness created by coronavirus.
 
The Prime Minister said, people are at home during lockdown, but they are not alone as collective strength of entire country is with each one of them.
 
PM Modi also said, the way people paid gratitude to those fighting against COVID-19 on 22nd of last month has become a model that is being emulated by other countries. PM added that Janata Curfew and ringing of bells have made people of the country aware of their unity amid this challenging time."
2020-04-04,TrueIndologyBot,DDnews,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/DDnews/comments/funtsy/russias_bolshoi_theater_goes_online_as/fmdsshb/,"**Summary:** 

The Bolshoi, which closed on March 17 until April 10, joins a string of other Russian theaters, opera houses and museums that have turned to online streaming to satisfy Russians’ cultural needs during the coronavirus lockdown.
Russia has so far recorded 1,036 cases of the virus and five related deaths, and has stepped up measures to curb its spread. This weekend Moscow will shutter all cafes, restaurants and shops apart from those selling food and medicine.
The Bolshoi’s ballet dancers are having to get used to training and keeping in shape at home.
“Of course it’s a very difficult time for us,” Denis Rodkin, a principal dancer, told Reuters on Friday. “We really depend on our profession... I hope that this will not last long and everything will be up and running again soon.”
In the meantime, Rodkin said, the performances streamed online might help keep people’s spirits up while they are confined to their homes.
“Art, and the Bolshoi Theater’s broadcasts in particular, support people in these difficult conditions,” he said. “They will be inspired, recharged with art, and all this will end.”
Ballet soloist Ksenia Zhiganshina also put a brave face on the enforced closure of the theater and its impact on the dancers.

The country with the worst COVID19 fatality rate (deaths per 1M population) is currently San Marino (943 deaths per 1M population).  If Australia were to experience the same fatality rate as San Marino we would have fewer than 24,000 deaths associated with COVID19 (943 x 25.415M = 23,966.345).

Australia's current case fatality rate (CFR) is 0.52% (0.52% of cases result in a fatality).  Whilst this rate is currently slowly climbing, it is also the 5th lowest in the world.

It is important that current measures remain in place (and are not removed, as Rozner is demanding), but we also need to be thinking about when it is appropriate to return to business as usual.  If we persist with an approach that puts literally hundreds of thousands of people (approximately 200,000, possibly more, employers have registered for the Job Keeper program) under severe economic stress the fatality rate due to suicides may be higher than what would otherwise have been the COVID19 fatality rate.

Right, which is how a fart dissipates like two months ago in the frozen food aisle of Lucky's where there were only two other people thirty feet away coming towards me. I walked past them and several seconds later into a memorably noxious cloud of air that was wayyy bigger than twelve feet across. Of course a walking fart doesn't have only a single origin point, but despite the HVAC the air was calm enough to slowly dissipate.

>This will remain true forever now until an effective vaccine happens. What will you do about it?

Inform people not to be lax in their social distancing when it's possible, like outdoors, to get further away. And reiterating that shopping isn't safe even where people are keeping six feet apart, so try hard to minimize trips and interactions.

> What are your odds of someone random being outdoors and breathing and happening to have it and it just happens to float in a miasma your way and you just happen to be downwind? Are those even odds worrying about?

If I'm upwind, or further than six feet from others outdoors the odds of safety are improved.

None of your other example questions have short term odds of danger anywhere close to this virus.


> you haven't even established that the virus will live long outside with UV and other conditions and most epidemiologists seem to think the risk is miniscule.

I looked that up just recently because I'd read sunlight kills the virus in just a few hours. Well studies about that aren't conclusive enough to say that much time is enough. So the amount of time to our current knowledge is somewhere between a few hours and a few days.

Get a iife beside LoL, study the world, I dont know : either you are stuck with LoL 24/7 and it is indeed your life so you are very upset at IWD kind of people, or you just dont know enough shit going on around the world.


First thing first : your analogy sucks because in IWD's case, he can actually be pertinent and useful ""half of the time"" but the nice-u boyfriend is just nice. 


Second : using a girlfriend is never a good analogy. If the not-nice boyfriend was IWD, it would more look like abusive relationship, judging by what we can see of him. It puts the idea in your readers mind.


Third : 1 girlfriend 1 boy friend. 1 IWD, X (>1) ""victims"" of his flame. So analogy is fucked up again and pretending that saying IWD can be intersting in casting when its pro scene is like excusing abusive behavior is kinda silly. You should be ashamed of yourself, your rhetoric is full of hate.


I am from EUW and I dont like IWD ever. But you coming up exposing your false analogy and trying to explain that people are eating a Rotten apple, nah, get over yourself. Its your fuckin life and if you wanna lifelong ban him, great, but dont act up because you are ridiculous hating IWD kind of people the most when our World is full of way worse people. 


I could make an analogy about what you hate the most: it is like a ideologist explaining and legitimating why he hates someone else. Oops, not an analogy there. Sorry."

This leaves it incapable of infecting you as it needs these proteins to do so effectively.

The coronavirus has a lipid (fat) bubble surrounding it. This is why just water is not good at washing it off, because fat is hydrophobic and so doesn’t mix with water. This hydrophobic bubble means that the water will just slide right off.

The molecules which make up ‘soap’ have one hydrophilic end (loves water) and one hydrophobic end (hates water). This hydrophobic end is capable of penetrating the viruses lipid bubble because they are both hydrophobic. However the hydrophilic part of the molecule cannot enter the virus so the molecule ends up half in the bubble and half out. As I mentioned the hydrophilic end loves water so when you rinse your hands this end of the molecule will stick to the water. This causes the virus to be washed away and leaves your hands clean of the virus.

I tried to explain that as simply as possible, hope it helped."

- [Respiratory virus shedding in exhaled breath and efficacy of face masks](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0843-2)

>We detected coronavirus in respiratory droplets and aerosols in 3 of 10 (30%) and 4 of 10 (40%) of the samples collected without face masks, respectively, **but did not detect any virus in respiratory droplets or aerosols collected from participants wearing face masks**, this difference was significant in aerosols and showed a trend toward reduced detection in respiratory droplets (Table 1b).
>
>For rhinovirus, there were no significant differences between detection of virus with or without face masks, both in respiratory droplets and in aerosols (Table 1b). 
>
>**We also demonstrated the efficacy of surgical masks to reduce coronavirus detection and viral copies in large respiratory droplets and in aerosols** (Table 1b). This has important implications for control of COVID-19, suggesting that **surgical face masks could be used by ill people to reduce onward transmission**.

----


From the general public use viewpoint, any reduction in transmission from infected via mask to atmosphere, and then from there via mask worn by another to that second person, that creates a double barrier ie attenuating factor which should diminish the R0 infection factor considerably.  If one mask halves, and second mask halves, that together leads to 1/4 the infection rate.

We have had experts saying this for a while:

>
>In the Czech Republic, the growth of news is low whereas in other parts of Europe the pandemic is largely out of control. This occurred after the government announced it was compulsory to wear something covering a part of your mouth and nose when leaving your residences – such as a home-made mask or a scarf on March 18.
>
>Howard claimed that “one of the key reasons for the decrease in the growth of the cases is a massive country-wide community initiative to create and wear home-made masks.”
>
>In just 10 days, the country went from no mask usage to nearly 100 percent usage, with nearly all the masks made at home with easily accessible materials, like old t-shirts.
>
>Howard claimed that in South Korea, Japan, and Taiwan as theses countries are using masks to prevent the spread of the disease. “In South Korea, Japan, and Taiwan there is no lock-down. Yet COVID-19 is being controlled in these countries. How has this happened? One of the key reasons is that mask-wearing in public is ubiquitous and socially expected,” Howard said.

Notwithstanding the tsunami of promos to get people back into venues, the money that some people didn't gamble during this crisis will simply be giving them more ammunition when the pokies are back on.

True, some small number of people will rid themselves of their gambling habit, but some will also pick one up or exacerbate one due to sheer boredom. It is actually quite easy to play them online.

Would not surprise me to see record takings in the first couple of months when pubs are back open.

Also, while its fine to hate pokies, its uneducated to view problems gamblers generally as unintelligent.
It is also worth noting that people who hate pokies do not go into these venues, and simply have no concept of who goes in there and why. Its just what they read in the Guardian.

There is also the valid point that people are able to decide in this country what legal activities they do and do not want to spend their money on.

For example, if you like running, go for a run (while social distancing) tomorrow. If you like listening to music, listen to music for two hours.

After that tell yourself the following “I’m going to get myself organize today.” Create a google doc, list all your classes. First, list all missing assignments, then right below list your current assignments. If you are still able to turn in missing work, do that first. Any missing assignments that you can no longer make up, disregard completely.

After that promise yourself to get at least 3 assignments done in the list every day until you are all caught up. Make sure you give yourself breaks in between and you recognize that every assignment that you complete is helping you reach your goal of completely catching up. 

Start with the smaller, easier assignments, if possible, it will make you feel good when you are realizing you are making progress.

Once you are all caught up, continue the same process.   
Make sure that everyday you are doing something that you love  + getting three hrs of school work done (more if you want). Acknowledge that sometimes you are not going to do any work, and that’s perfectly fine, but get back into your routine of getting 3 assignments done each day (until you are all caught up) then transition to the 3 hrs school work day routine.

Also, recognize that this semester has been extraordinary difficult due to the Coronavirus, so is perfectly fine if you are not performing at your best — most of aren’t, too. Remember you have the P/NP option and if you adapt my plan, I’m sure you will pass all your classes.

My son (26) was hospitalized January 15, high fever, coughing and strangely psychotic behaviors.  The local ER (in maricopa county) did nothing.  For the next three days 911 would be called and he would be taking him by ambulance only to be released.  Thankfully the first responders urged the ER to keep him run tests on him because they feared he was a danger to himself due to his odd behaviors and whaling in pain. 
They would keep him for the next few weeks having to actually place him in a medically induced coma on a ventilator.  Now back at this time I hadn’t really heard much of this coronavirus.  They asked if he had traveled outside of the country in the last few weeks in which he hadn’t..... then they asked if he had traveled outside of the state of Arizona and we  we replied that he had been to Ohio, Texas, Washington and California all since the beginning of December.  Looking back those are states first hit hard besides New York.  
Now keep in mind they are thinking he has viral meningitis but it could be bacterial or fungal meningitis. For the viral they have to start antiviral medication as soon as possible otherwise you miss the window for it to actually work.  He was placed on three different types of meds for each strand of meningitis.  Cultures were taken, blood tests, CT, EKG and xrays...... on top of this it was discovered he had pneumonia.  
Since bacterial meningitis is highly contagious when we were visiting we had to suit up completely.  He was in ICU isolation.  After two weeks being in coma they try to wake him up he became too agitated and being 6 foot 7, and 240 pounds they could not restrain him with the aggressive behavior so he was placed back in medically induced coma for another week.  Every time I spoke to the nurse or the doctor they talked about the coronavirus and how they wanted to test him, they made it seem so easy, that there was a test for it.  So I asked if there was any cases around in which they didn’t say no ......but they didn’t readily say yes.  
Long story short they never did fully figure out what he had so after finishing the antivirals and antifungal and antibacterial before he left the hospital after 23 days they placed a pick line in his arm so that he could continue to get his anti-biotics intravenously.  I’m assuming they were treating him for the pneumonia still.  
Here it is in March and he still has a pic line in he’s still receiving different kinds of anabiotic‘s.  

My oldest daughter and I joke that he probably had the coronavirus but they couldn’t test him with no tests available and that luckily he survived it and he was into baited and sleeping the entire time he had it.  Like I said a joke......

I think a small number of people hoarded all they could at the start, which caused the news to talk about toilet paper shortages at the stores. Then when NORMAL people finally see some at the store, they take the opportunity to buy as much as they can. This causes another shortage and hence more panic buying by other people that wouldn't normally buy so fucking much TP.

I already had like 6-8 months worth of TP before coronavirus and all the panic buying. But the longer that goes on with me still not seeing TP in the stores, I wonder if I should buy some in case I can't find any when I run it. If I am thinking that, then I am pretty sure others are as well.

But then again, TP isn't a necessity. You can always use rags that you can wash in boiling water. Can also take a shower after shitting."

Oh, this reminded me of the annual review exercise that Tim Ferriss shared in one of his email newsletters.  

As part of it, you review your calendar/journal for each week of the year that's just ended. On a sheet of paper, in 2 columns (Positive | Negative), you write down your peak positive and peak negative experiences from each week. 

Then you apply the Pareto principle (80/20) to the final list - *“What 20% of each column produced the most reliable or powerful peaks?”*

And then you schedule more of those most positive ones for your new year and write down a reminder about the most negative ones on a “NOT-TO-DO LIST”.

Apparently, nature can be a replacement for real-life social interactions, to some degree. I guess /u/2BrainsAndEggs  ' question wasn't random, given the context of this whole quarantine thing…

There is a huge collection of research studies about happiness, grouped by the statements & guidelines they support at https://my.happify.com/research/

Specifically about nature, they say:

* S-21: Looking at nature activates parts of brain linked to emotional stability and optimism; boosts creativity
* S-37: Interacting with nature results in a cognitive boost, reduces stress & anxiety, preserves positive mood
* S-38: Looking at nature makes us feel more connected, caring, generous
* S-79: Being in nature reduces rumination
* S-83: Looking at pictures of nature and green spaces may help us recover from stress — *that's doable even during maximum quarantine measures and when you can't see any plants from your window and don't have home plants*"

I don't think they are doing enough. I just want to quell the idea that we are just twiddling our thumbs. Most people, especially [on the state level](https://www.axios.com/states-shelter-in-place-coronavirus-66e9987a-a674-42bc-8d3f-070a1c0ee1a9.html), are taking it very seriously. 300 million Americans (90%+) are under state stay-at-home order now. It's fairly comparable to [Europe's response](https://www.politico.eu/article/europes-coronavirus-lockdown-measures-compared/) as a whole.

You are correct, they could issue a nationwide shutdown, and don't want to. They don't want to close nonessential businesses nationally, and they don't want to be blamed for leaving their constituents in extreme poverty, especially with the upcoming election.   

The States and the Feds are trying to walk a tight rope here, which is *somewhat* understandable because a large percentage of the population lives paycheck to paycheck and can't go without two weeks' pay. 

From what I can see, the big complaint from Governors is one of resources. the Governors can shut down the states (and are) but what they can't do is put money where it needs to be. Quickly building hospitals, expanding medicaid, and providing small businesses and individuals the means to survive the pandemic are all things we need to see from the Federal Government. States just don't have the resources to do enough of it. 

\[Tinfoil hat time\] From a 30,000 foot view, it looks as though the Whitehouse wants governors to shut down the states for them, which is largely what's happening. The best-case scenario for the Trump administration is that the feds do relatively little aside from stimulus checks, states close down 'voluntarily' and they don't have to take the blame for the loss of income that is going to destroy thousands of lives.

I for one am all for a Nation-wide shelter in place order, however, it must come along with the funds to help people and businesses limp through."

>The south had many republican congressmen immediately after the civil war when they were supposedly ""racist"".

Are you seriously saying that if there was a switch, it would be immediate? Because that is not what I said and is obviously a strawman you could argue against.  This occurred over a period of time, during the civil rights era.

>>Or are you saying that the South went from overwhelmingly Democrat to overwhelmingly Republican during the civil rights era because its inhabitants just... switched political ideologies themselves?

By the way, you conveniently ignored my question, I would like an answer. Why did the South go from solidly Democrat to solidly Republican after the civil rights era?

>By the ""honest"" media?

Yes, by the honest media. There is a litany of primary sources, including Republican strategist Lee Atwater himself:

>>You start out in 1954 by saying, ""N\*\*\*\*\*, n\*\*\*\*\*, n\*\*\*\*\*"". By 1968 you can't say ""n\*\*\*\*\*""—that hurts you. Backfires. So you say stuff like forced busing, states' rights and all that stuff. You're getting so abstract now [that] you're talking about cutting taxes, and all these things you're talking about are totally economic things and a byproduct of them is [that] blacks get hurt worse than whites. And subconsciously maybe that is part of it. I'm not saying that. But I'm saying that if it is getting that abstract, and that coded, that we are doing away with the racial problem one way or the other. You follow me—because obviously sitting around saying, ""We want to cut this"", is much more abstract than even the busing thing, and a hell of a lot more abstract than ""N\*\*\*\*\*, n\*\*\*\*\*"". So, any way you look at it, race is coming on the backbone.

The websites telling you this didn't happen are not honest media, they are the PragerU grifters of the world.

While I have you here, you made this blatantly false statement earlier:
>If they switched, then why didn't the representatives switch? Very few congressmen changed parties in the supposed switch.

Representatives DID switch. Strom Thurmond, opposed to the ruling of *Brown vs Board of Education*, switched from being a Democrat to being a Republican in 1964 because of the Civil Rights Act. He called for other Southern Democrats to do the same, believing they would be able to elect Goldwater with a southern coalition.

Here's some more representatives that switched:
*SC Rep. Arthur Ravenel Jr.
*SC Rep. Floyd Spence
*Texas Rep. Jack Cox
*Mississippi Sen. Stanford Morse
*Alabama Rep. Albert Goldthwaite
*Louisiana Rep. Roderick Miller
*South Carolina Sen. Marshall Parker

I do believe China largely has the pandemic under control though. 

There are two ways a disease can go. Exponential growth or exponential decay.

This disease is contagious with people who might not show symptoms for a couple of weeks. If people were still getting infected in China then we'd see exponential growth. 

The only argument you could make is that China are somehow taking measures more extreme than the ones in those videos to cover up secret outbreaks.

But as you can see in the videos I've linked the Chinese seem to be doing pretty much everything they can to prevent the spread of the disease. Making me think it's more likely that they just have things under control again.

To look at scenes of everybody wearing masks, full body protective gear on those who work in the stores that remain open and work in health care, streets being disinfected, temperatures being taken at various locations such as apartments blocks / super markets / train stations, mass testing, mobile phone geolocation contact tracing, mass quarantine, social distancing, and many other precautions. And then say ""I think China is covering this up"".

“The country with the worst COVID19 fatality rate (deaths per 1M population) is currently San Marino (943 deaths per 1M population).  If Australia were to experience the same fatality rate as San Marino we would have fewer than 24,000 deaths associated with COVID19 (943 x 25.415M = 23,966.345).”

That figure is only relevant if the pandemic is completely over and we’re looking at fatality rates with the benefit of hindsight. No, we’re actually at the start of an ongoing pandemic, so calculating the deaths per million pop merely on deaths up to date is irrelevant.

Your assertion of “deaths by suicide > deaths by coronavirus and it’s impact on the health system” isn’t backed by anything. The point is to keep the deaths due to this pandemic low. The case fatality rate in Australia will climb dramatically for  both COVID-19 and other illnesses if the number of ICU beds and other medical resources we have are completely overwhelmed. 

It’s unfortunate that the govt and their chief medical officers haven’t been more open with the worst case scenario, or their modelling in general. We’ve had recent promises and backtracking on that front. But I’m quite confident that their worst case scenario where we “do nothing”, ie keep restaurants, cafes and businesses open as usual, would be a number of deaths *all told by the end of the pandemic* an order of magnitude higher than your back of the envelope calculation based on deaths in San Marino about 2 months into the pandemic."

I'm referring to this FAQ from my states unemployment website. My state govt is telling me that If I feel in danger at my job because of covid-19 I should apply for unemployment, implying it's possible to receive benefits because my life is affected by a pandemic/national disaster.

It is more popular for the asian culture to purchase exotic endangered animals as pets (pangolin)... so it is believed it mutated from bats (sold at same market) to jump to another animal (pangolin) which mutated to jumping to human. In order for a virus to mutate to jump species it mainly needs constant contact of said species to evolve ways to not be killed by anti bodies.

So since bats and pangolins are often in close contact with eachother at the markets the virus most likely first mutated to pangolin. Since humans buy pangolins as pets not to eat (cooking a bat would of killed the virus) thus more contact with a human for a longer period of time. It then mutated to infect humans... then we go into the social aspect of humans, touching things, being close proximity to others, alot of ppl not covering a cough or sneeze, the virus now learns to mutate to human-human transmission.... once that happens the virus will want to mutate again to infect more species(we have multiple strains of covid-19 that does human-human transmission, aswell as a strain that can go human-cat?

Researchers at Johns Hopkins University now have federal approval to test if blood plasma from recovered COVID-19 patients can help protect the heroes on the front line of the battle against the coronavirus.

The hope is that transfusions of blood plasma would boost the immune systems of health care providers, first responders and others at high risk of exposure, the researchers said.

COVID-19 survivors carry antibodies generated to fight the disease and the plasma is the part of blood that contains those antibodies.

“The ability to carry out a prophylaxis trial will tell us whether plasma is effective in protecting our health care workers and first responders from COVID-19,” said Arturo Casadevall, a Johns Hopkins infectious disease expert, in a statement.

The plasma transfusions are a common treatment for patients suffering severe bleeding;  and scientists hope the same treatment can be used as both a preventative therapy and to help boost the immune systems of those already sick.


The US Food and Drug Administration issued Johns Hopkins approved for a clinical trial Friday.


 
Coronavirus survivor's blood may save lives of other victims
Casadevall has amassed a team of physicians and scientists from around the country who are now establishing a network of hospitals and blood banks that can collect, isolate and process blood plasma from COVID-19 survivors, according to Johns Hopkins.

“Dr. Casadevall and his colleagues from across Johns Hopkins and partners around the nation are working with creativity and persistence to face this disease head-on,” said Johns Hopkins President Ronald J. Daniels in a statement."

Here are 19 times Trump downplayed — or “belittled” — the virus and the threat it posed.

Jan. 22: “We have it totally under control. It’s one person coming in from China, and we have it under control. It’s going to be just fine,” Trump said in an interview with CNBC.

Jan. 30: “Working closely with China and others on Coronavirus outbreak. Only 5 people in U.S., all in good recovery,” Trump tweeted.

Feb. 7: Trump tweeted that, “as the weather starts to warm & the virus hopefully becomes weaker, and then gone.”

Feb. 10: “Now, the virus that we’re talking about having to do — you know, a lot of people think that goes away in April with the heat — as the heat comes in. Typically, that will go away in April,” Trump said at a White House event with governors.

Feb. 10: “Looks like by April, you know, in theory, when it gets a little warmer, it miraculously goes away,” Trump said at a campaign rally in New Hampshire.

Feb. 19: “I think when we get into April, in the warmer weather, that has a very negative effect on that and that type of a virus. So let’s see what happens, but I think it’s going to work out fine,” Trump said in an interview with a local Fox News affiliate in Arizona.

Feb. 24: “The Coronavirus is very much under control in the USA. We are in contact with everyone and all relevant countries. CDC & World Health have been working hard and very smart. Stock Market starting to look very good to me!” Trump tweeted.

Feb. 26: “When you have 15 people, and the 15 within a couple of days is going to be down to close to zero, that’s a pretty good job we’ve done,” Trump said at a White House news conference.

Feb. 27: “Congratulations and thank you to our great Vice President & all of the many professionals doing such a fine job at CDC & all other agencies on the Coronavirus situation. Only a very small number in U.S., & China numbers look to be going down. All countries working well together!” Trump tweeted.

Feb. 27: “It’s going to disappear. One day, it’s like a miracle, it will disappear,” Trump said at a White House news conference.

Feb. 28: “The Democrats are politicizing the coronavirus. This is their new hoax,” Trump said at a campaign rally in South Carolina.

March 4: “Some people will have this at a very light level and won’t even go to a doctor or hospital, and they’ll get better. There are many people like that,” Trump said at a briefing with the CEOs of some of the country’s major airlines.

March 5: “With approximately 100,000 CoronaVirus cases worldwide, and 3,280 deaths, the United States, because of quick action on closing our borders, has, as of now, only 129 cases (40 Americans brought in) and 11 deaths. We are working very hard to keep these numbers as low as possible!” Trump tweeted.

March 9: “The Fake News Media and their partner, the Democrat Party, is doing everything within its semi-considerable power (it used to be greater!) to inflame the CoronaVirus situation, far beyond what the facts would warrant. Surgeon General, ‘The risk is low to the average American.'” Trump tweeted.

March 9: “So last year 37,000 Americans died from the common Flu. It averages between 27,000 and 70,000 per year. Nothing is shut down, life & the economy go on. At this moment there are 546 confirmed cases of CoronaVirus, with 22 deaths. Think about that!” Trump tweeted.

March 10: “We’re prepared, and we’re doing a great job with it. And it will go away. Just stay calm. It will go away,” Trump said at a briefing with Republican senators.

March 23: “America will again, and soon, be open for business — very soon — a lot sooner than three or four months that somebody was suggesting. A lot sooner. We cannot let the cure be worse than the problem itself.  We’re not going to let the cure be worse than the problem,” Trump said at a White House news conference.

March 24: “I’d love to have it open by Easter, I would love to have it open by Easter, I will tell you that right now. I would love to have that,” Trump said at a Fox News town hall.

March 24: “We’ve never closed down the country for the flu. So you say to yourself, ‘What is this all about?’ ” Trump said at the Fox News town hall, again wrongly comparing COVID-19 to the flu."

A crew member on the coronavirus-stricken Grand Princess cruise ship has died, a local advocacy group announced Friday morning.

The worker, who was Filipino, was transferred from the ship to a hospital in San Francisco, where the person died, becoming the third aboard the ill-fated island-hopping excursion to perish from the disease.

A group of other Filipino workers from the ship, who have since been repatriated, along with local labor and community officials, plan to hold a news conference Friday to “protect the rights, health and livelihood” of fellow crew members as they are released from quarantine on Saturday.

That includes “demanding transparency, testing, and treatment” for everyone quarantined on the ship, the news release said.

While passengers on the cruise eventually disembarked at the Port of Oakland — many of whom were just released from quarantine at Travis Air Force Base — hundreds of the ship’s crew members have remained on board, under quarantine, as it relocated to San Francisco’s cruise terminal this week. They will be allowed to leave the ship Saturday afternoon, according to the California Office of Emergency Services.

Two male passengers were the first on board the ship to die from COVID-19, federal officials announced last week, while 103 had tested positive.

The Department of Health and Human Services did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Friday."

>Cuban officials say the cargo carrier of Colombia-based Avianca Airlines declined to carry the aid to Cuba because its major shareholder is a U.S.-based company subject to the trade embargo on Cuba. The embargo has exceptions for food and medical aid but companies are often afraid to carry out related financing or transportation due to the risk of fines or prosecution under the embargo.

>Human-rights groups have been calling for the U.S. to lift sanctions on Venezuela, Cuba and Iran during the coronavirus epidemic in order to permit the flow of more aid. The Trump administration has argued that only the countries’ government would benefit from the sanctions relief.

This might be hard to understand. But the coronavirus isn't political. It will kill you regardless of your political whim.


Trump was unprepared for this because he doesn't listen to advice nor does he seek out information to make a decision. He's supposed to be the most powerful person on Earth, with access to more information than anyone else on Earth, yet is a buffoon who contradicts what the CDC says. He doesn't believe in science and neither does his equally stupid VP who has publicly stated he doesn't believe in evolution.


All Trump has done so far is outbid states for masks and PPE, contradict everything the experts have said and pissed off our trade allies by trying to monopolize control of medical supplies. Bravo!"

2020-04-04,preritttt,AustralianPolitics,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/AustralianPolitics/comments/fu47eg/international_students_who_cant_support/fmeclxn/,"No one is asking for the same level of assistance that the locals are getting. That would be stupid. Ofc, locals should be the first priority but the only priority? That would be cruel! International students are only asking to refund some percentage of our fees which we paid from our own pockets and for On-Campus education and infrastructure. We are not getting what was promised and totally understand why. So, now it is government and universities' responsibility to understand our situation and do the right thing. No need to be ungrateful, mean, and inhuman towards temporary residents. 

&#x200B;

>First of all, you are choosing to study in Australia. No one in Australia forced you to come here. Australians don't owe non-Australians anything, just like (Your country) doesn't owe (not your country) and Australia anything.

It was my choice to come here and study.  Ofc the govt or the people do not owe me anything just for making that decision. I am grateful for getting this opportunity. Not everyone is lucky enough to get the same. 

&#x200B;

>Secondly, everyone pays tax. International student fees are higher because the government subsidizes Australian citizens. The cost of an education isn't simply higher because you're foreign. The total degree is the same cost in many cases.

So, technically international students are paying for the locals to attend university. Glad you accept that! Do you know the federal government has been cutting funding for the universities for a very long time and that is why universities run to international students bc we pay loads of cash which makes it possible for the universities to survive. 

&#x200B;

>Third, if anything YOUR government should be providing assistance to you too. If I'm a kid and I'm short on money, do I ask my parents or my friends parents for money?

I am not paying taxes to my government. I am studying and working here to support the Australian economy. It is fair if I expect the government here to acknowledge that, show some compassion, and assist me by ordering the university to refund a part of my fees bc I am not getting what was promised - On-Campus Education and access to the infrastructure. If not, refund my entire fee and fucking kick me out of the country. I will gladly go back to my country which treats EVERYONE equally and as humans not cash cows especially during a PANDEMIC. 

&#x200B;

>Fourth, Australia is most likely better than your home country, or providing a better education. Why else would you be here? There is plenty of people who will continue to want to come to Australia. You're not special.

Exactly! That is why I came here. No rocket science in that. But if the Australian government and people like you keep treating the international students just as cash cows and not show empathy & compassion during such tough times, I am pretty sure people would stop coming here. And just so you know, if people stop coming here, this country is fucked. Heck, only if the Chinese stop coming here this country is fucked. Just so you know [Australia would be thrown into a deep recession and face huge disruption if China’s economy crashes](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/aug/29/coalition-must-give-up-dream-of-budget-surplus-if-china-crashes-report-says) . So, when you are so dependent on just one country, international students and temporary resident it is not good to have this toxic attitude and ungrateful behaviour. Not good for your economy, mate. 

I am not an Indian citizen but have Indian roots and I am proud of the fact India (which is probably poorer and a worse country than the great Australia) airlifted not only its citizens but other nationals as well who were stranded in Middle East, Iran, Italy, and many other countries unlike Australia which abandoned its own citizens and tells them [we can't get you home](https://7news.com.au/lifestyle/health-wellbeing/government-issues-warning-to-australians-stranded-overseas-amid-coronavirus-pandemic-c-762470). Shame! 

&#x200B;

>Fifth, take responsibility for your circumstances. Just like many Australians who are out of work, they're entitled to help because they've paid taxes their whole life. A person temporarily in the country isn't suddenly a liability for that country. If that was the case, the whole world would be a single country.

I am not being a liability on the government even if I am a temporary resident. I am not snatching away your money. I was earning a honest living, paying taxes and fee. This is a global crisis and people are out of job that is why asking the government for assistance. Just asking to give some of OUR money back to us and that too for a valid reason. If that is the attitude you have I am afraid Australian mateship is a lie. 

&#x200B;

>Sixth, you can get help by seeking it from various charities and such. Plenty of people want to help you.

Have you heard of [Sikhism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sikhism)? Sikhs are [offering free food](https://www.sbs.com.au/news/insight/sikh-community-works-overtime-to-help-those-in-need) to everyone across Australia and the world. Many of the volunteers are international students. Did that during the bushfire crisis as well. They are not asking your nationality before offering [Seva](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selfless_service). I am glad we have people like 'em serving humanity. People like you and your PM, who is the Australian brother of Donald Trump, need to learn from them. 

&#x200B;

I hope you are staying safe and healthy, mate. Have a good one!"

I'm not insinuating anything. I'm saying straight out that you want people who have different thoughts to you die of this disease so that you can 'live a little', and you continue to flat out disregard (or shrug and say fuck it, that's collateral) that it affects others not in that demographic as well. Should my neighbours newborn die of Coronavirus being transmitted just so that you can live a little? Should my mates dad die because you're fucking bored? Should my fiance have to deal with the uncontrollable wildfire spread of Coronavirus because you have had to delay your life by a few years, and risk catching it herself?

You have your life, and it might suck for a while. That is not worth people dying over. 

You are right, your personal achievements mean fuck all, and I probably would tear them to shreds. However, I probbaly asked incorrectly: Societal achievements are the ones that are in question here, as you apparently believe that ones with a worth to society are the only ones who should live. 

If you don't have a societal worth, and your only contribution has been to accrue a line of debt to go become a student which has clearly not tought you much of ethics, humanity or selflessness, then I think you are the turkey voting for Christmas, and the view that is coming across for your societal worth is one that is you are simply going to be a taxpayer for your life. 

I think you are trying to use Sanctimonious as an insult here, but it's coming across as hollow.

Wash your hands, stay inside and don't be a cunt to others. That is the advice of science in perhaps a few less words than they would use. That has societal worth. If your actions kills 20, rather than your inaction killing none, you are as much to blame for those deaths. I'd rather see such an individuals quality of life curtailed."

No. According to the [stats](https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/#countries) Ireland is testing more than twice per million as the UK. 
UK 2.560 per million versus Ireland 6.119 per million.

Testing helps understand in advance the expected load on the health service and also the current rate of contagion in the public. This is vitally important for helping the timing for relaxation of shutdown measures. 

In Ireland the public can contact their GP if they feel they're coming down with it, their GP books them an appointment with a test centre. This has been the practice for three weeks now alongside national shutdown. 

Now I am curious as to how this is proactive response is a cull policy?"

- Do you know anyone who died of the flu?  Do you know anyone who died of Coronavirus?  Ask the same question about being on a ventilator

- Have you ever seen hospitals in other countries get overloaded by the flu?  Have you seen other countries get overloaded by Coronavirus?

- what is your best guess for the death rate of the flu (.1) What about Coronavirus (best case is .6%).  That’s 6 times a death rate.

- what is your best guess at how contagious this is, compared to the flu.  Best optimistic guess is they are equal, yet half the US gets flu vaccinations.

- have you ever heard of a nursing home where more than 10 patients dies from the flu in a 2 week period?  Or a cruise where 4 people died from the flu?  Or a country where 500 people died from the flu in a day when the flu season lasts up to 6 months?

Sorry not meant to be at you playing devils advocate, but all the signs were there.  I was one of the very early people in January saying it was just a flu - but the videos of China welding doors shut, dragging infected people into 17 newly built hospitals, and shutting an entire country down when they don’t give a shit about there people, should have been all we needed to know.  Our government knew if late January and certainly by early February, we have the stock sales by senators to prove it.

Trump actually might have made an interesting selfish game theory decision.  If he shuts down the country in February and invests in the medical containment, he screws the economy are loses the election.  If he does nothing and the country gets wiped he loses the election. But if he does nothing and the virus magically avoided the US by luck, mutation, or warmer weather he wins the election.  He bet the country and lists but for him it’s a wash."

Testing is the only way to contain spread, unless you want an 80% total lockdown for weeks and weeks.

People are still going to work, going to parks, going to cafes and so on and on. They are thinking the problem skipped Japan. It has been 4 weeks since anyone on reddit outside of Japan reddit - it seems - has been worried about overplaying the crisis because of panic."

>There is another way ( effectively a homebrew using reagents that are available 

Have you ever worked with these kits? The 'reagents' are just bottled lysis and washing solutions. If you've run a PCR with a kit *and* by hand, you'll know these reagents are difficult and highly complex things like... DMSO and chloroform... I know there are a lot of statements from government to the effect of what you are saying, but in practice I have not seen anything that would make sense of that. 

>The setup of very large scale automation to achieve the numbers of tests needed 

So do them by hand in the meantime? Do we have a shortage of trained staff who can follow the instruction sheet on a box to run the PCR? Given all the Universities are shut... No. 

>Just because it is not reported in the papers does not mean it is not happening 

So you're saying that, like Germany, we now have a Dunkirk-style epic effort underway with every single available lab space being put towards this task, but no one's reporting on it and the government is hiding it for some reason?"

has generated a lot of conversation around whether
one should abstain from communion for fear of contracting or transmitting illness, particularly 
[COVID-19](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus_disease_2019).
It is a common teaching that communion cannot transmit illness, 
however many other common aspects of parish life and piety can transmit contagions.

If you are ill with a communicable disease you should self-isolate from large gatherings,
[including Church services](https://www.goarch.org/-/encyclical-covid-19-pandemic).
While communion may not spread illness, sneezing, coughing, touching, and kissing people or objects still can.

While you may be young and healthy please remember that parishes contain many at-risk people,
and that the only defense is herd hygiene behaviors, including self-isolation. There is currently no treatment for the disease.
Please be mindful of your responsibility in protecting your parish and your wider community and do your part to

If you wish to take communion while ill, or while self-isolating, please contact your parish priest. If you believe you are ill, 
please see a doctor and/or contact your local health authorities for guidance.

There will be national tensions in countries where Covid-19 was particularly deadly and politicians will have to explain why the health system didn't cope while other nations had lower lethality rates, higher testing rates, etc. (E.g.

Nope, the introduction of the paper warning about this in 2007

The rapid economic growth in southern China has led to an increasing demand for animal proteins including those from exotic gamefood animals such as civets. Large numbers and varieties ofthese wild game mammals in overcrowded cages and the lackof biosecurity measures in wet markets allowed the jumping of this novel virus from animals to human. Its capacity for human-to-human transmission, the lack of awareness inhospital infection control, and international air travel facilitated the rapid global dissemination of this agent.

Located in Jiangxia District, Wuhan, Hubei, it opened mainland China's first biosafety level 4 (BSL–4) laboratory in 2015.  In 2020, the laboratory became a central focus during the 2019–20 coronavirus pandemic both for scientific data and research on the SARS-CoV-2 virus, but also as a possible source of the outbreak, particularly due to evidence of poor safety proceedures when studying the bat coronavirus.

My parents own a house, 3 apartments. One is rented by rooms. One of the tenants Y is harassing another tenant X, this started in early March. Y is apparently a bit crazy and insists that X is his future wife and has done other things to them, touching, etc. They met when they moved in and are not in any relationship, not even friends. He was asked to leave, given an eviction notice, he refused to accept that (he is still fully employed and can move). Y was arrested when X called the police on him twice and they just let him go the next day, I think he's out on bail for the second time. So now X is in danger in their own home and can't go anywhere. Police say X needs to file a restraining order before they can do anything. X can't get one because the courts are closed according to the helpful police Landlord can't evict to protect the other tenants. Yes they've spoken to a lawyer. X will probably end up dead or raped, yes that's how bad it is.

Another roommate decided he wasn't going to pay rent because he can't get evicted so to him it doesn't matter. Yes he said that. Yes he still has a job, he works from home. No his hours haven't been cut and he is still earning the same. He has spoken to another tenant from a different floor and now that Tenant has hinted that they may not pay but hasn't said outright.

Honestly I can't wait, hopefully only a few months, for all these shit people to get evicted. But by then it'll probably be too late as 3ish months of mortgage will have been unpaid and the house may soon go into for closure if they can't come up with the money, which due to unemployment from the coronavirus they may not be able to. And please don't comment on they should have saved and had enough to cover 6ish months of asshole people, because this argument will also apply to tenants so it's moot. (6 months because it takes time to evict people and then find new tenants and 6 months is a conservative time frame given that they have to wait 3 of them before they can start the process.)

A specific, core manifesto focusing on improving the NHS is always what I considered to be the winning message, and now with coronavirus even more so. The NHS is the only aspect of nationalisation that everyone in the country loves so it should be the poster child.

Your point about the messenger intrigues me. The way I see it, me and you have already been sold to. No one needs to convince us to vote Labour so it's all about who we think will do the best job of convincing others. I personally thought that was Nandy but I'm biased as her small northern town rhetoric obviously works really well on me but likely won't work as well on the rest of the country. Keir has plenty of attributes you can sell him on, he's well-educated, he's an experienced legal professional and he has a knighthood. I think your distrust of him won't be shared by the rest of the country as history shows us well-educated men in suits do well in British politics.

Again I'm repeating myself but we are very much still a left-wing party. I just hope you allow yourself to believe it instead of joining the inevitable backlash that will come from the far left of the party when Keir doesn't pledge to nationalise every industry in the land next election.

""But there aren’t actually 80,000 ventilators in the federal stockpile. As of early March, the Strategic National Stockpile only had 16,600 ventilators. It has even fewer now: On April 3, the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) told Recode that the federal government has just 9,800 ventilators available. There are 9,054 remaining in the Strategic National Stockpile, and the Department of Defense has 900.
New York governor Andrew Cuomo said that just his state, which is the epicenter of the pandemic, will need as many as 37,000 ventilators at the peak of the outbreak. After waiting for relief from the Trump administration, Cuomo ultimately enlisted the National Guard to relocate ventilators from upstate facilities to New York City. As far as the rest of the country’s concerned, it’s safe the say that the Strategic National Stockpile isn’t even close to meeting the overall demand that’s expected during the coronavirus pandemic.

Don not ridicule differing opinions. Every bit of information is important now. 

The research paper — ""The possible origins of 2019-nCoV coronavirus"" — noted that virus most likely came from an animal known as the intermediate horseshoe bat.

""Here's the striking thing,"" Carlson said, ""there are no known colonies [of the bat] within 900 kilometers of Wuhan.""

Moreover, Carlson noted that there is no evidence to support the oft-repeated claims that this particular bat was sold at the wet markets in Wuhan

- Leave out the word “new” before daughter, or maybe just sign it G. You’re not telling them you want to change into someone else. You’re saying you want support in more fully being who you’ve always been.

There aren't enough tests to test every person in the world, and if people are asymptomatic testing only serves to cause panic, leading to permanent business closures and social shaming, and with contact tracing, potentially destroying families (people you've had ""high physical contact with"" are reported to whoever you come in contact with, apparently). 

If you test positive, even if you are asymptomatic, you have to be hospitalized by law, taking up a hospital bed while exposing medical workers unnecessarily. 

So there's a lot of reasons Japan and Japanese people have been hesitant to test unnecessarily beyond just keeping the Olympics from getting cancelled and businesses from having to shut down.

Though coronavirus has been here for three months, we don't have overloaded hospitals or reports of massive numbers of deaths. Japan is a low physical contact culture that wears face masks and become increasingly aware of the importance of handwashing. In fact, due to increases vigilance, the number of reduced flu deaths below the baseline each week the past few weeks are several times the number of total COVID-19 deaths in Japan. This is really good news.

The Japanese people follow government guidance much better than Westerners do. While we probably do need a few weeks of lockdown to nip this thing in the bud, I won't be surprised if after three months we've all already been exposed to relatively low viral loads of COVID-19 and built up immunity already."

The sequence of events suggests that the coronavirus may have been transmitted by the asymptomatic carrier. The incubation period for patient 1 was 19 days, which is long but within the reported range of 0 to 24 days.4 Her first RT-PCR result was negative; false-negative results have been observed related to the quality of the kit, the collected sample, or performance of the test. RT-PCR has been widely deployed in diagnostic virology and has yielded few false-positive outcomes.5 Thus, her second RT-PCR result was unlikely to have been a false-positive and was used to define infection with the coronavirus that causes COVID-19.”
(Rothe et al 2020) reported a timeline for four patients (patients 1 through 4) who contracted the virus from a fifth patient (index patient). “The infection appears to have been transmitted during the incubation period of the index patient, in whom the illness was brief and nonspecific.” “The fact that asymptomatic persons are potential sources of 2019-nCoV infection may warrant a reassessment of transmission dynamics of the current outbreak.” “Despite these concerns, all four patients who were seen in Munich have had mild cases and were hospitalized primarily for public health purposes. Since hospital capacities are limited — in particular, given the concurrent peak of the influenza season in the northern hemisphere — research is needed to determine whether such patients can be treated with appropriate guidance and oversight outside the hospital.”

2020-04-04,zsreport,politics,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/fusiyz/the_gops_refusal_to_oversee_trumps_emergency/fmef4ti/,"> Having lowered the bar to the ground and stomped it repeatedly, Trump has rendered his wholesale rejection of oversight into a nonissue. But measured against history, his stance is extraordinary. He is attempting to destroy a vital part of how government should, and used to, operate. And he has brought the entire Republican Party along with him to this dangerous position.
> 
> When Congress enacted the bank bailout in 2008, the same bill tried to ensure the money was spent properly by creating both an oversight panel in the Executive branch and a congressional oversight panel. When crafting the coronavirus relief bill, which spends three times as much money, Republicans fought all oversight. After holding out for several days, they relented to an inspector general to oversee the spending, but refused to allow the office any subpoena power. As a compromise, Republicans allowed the inspector general to notify Congress if the administration “unreasonably refused” access to information about the spending.
> 
> After the bill passed, Trump added a signing statement to the bill asserting that he would refuse to even cooperate with even this modest requirement."
