4. Central CDC didn't trust these two companies results, force them to destroy samples, tested by themselves. CDC protocols didn't allow commercial company test contiguous disease.

5. Central CDC confirmed it was a new type of coronavirus and made test kits. But all test results were negative. 

6. NIH/CDC sent 3 batches experts to investigate this virus, 1st and 2nd batches gave the conclusion that they didnt find evidence that it could transmit from person to person, 3rd batches found it indeed transmitted from person to person and also found healthcare worker infected.

China CDC spent 3 weeks to finally conclude it is a new contigous disease, just like US CDC spent more than 3 weeks preparing the test kits. Both of then are incompetent and caused a lot of deathes."

My family lives in the Veneto, in Northern Italy, one of the regions worst hit by the novel coronavirus. We are on lockdown. It’s scary. It’s lonely. It’s uncomfortable. And did I mention scary?

I’ll spare you the statistics and the sermons; both are already abundant. But I do want to make one thing clear: If you think that by stocking up your pantries you have absolved yourself from the responsibility of preparing for this virus, you are mistaken. This is a crisis like none before. Be skeptical of both naysayers and doomsayers; there’s no way of knowing how this will end.

The restrictions came upon us slowly but steadily. Within two weeks, our old lives were gone. First the schools closed, then came social distancing. Then the government locked down the hardest-hit areas: no more going in and out of certain provinces; limited movements within the “red zones.” Then the whole country shut down. Most stores closed their doors. People who could were asked to telework; those who could not, and did not have a job related to the continuation of essential services, were placed on part-time schedules or unpaid leave. When we went out, we had to carry a pass explaining our reasons for being outside to show to the law enforcement officers patrolling the streets. The priority became keeping everyone inside, at all times.

For some people, the gradual rollout made these measures hard to accept: Skeptical observers questioned the seriousness of the disease, given that the restrictions were not draconian from the start. And yet without time to adjust to a progressive loss of freedom, we wouldn’t have accepted it. We might have rebelled. Instead, we rallied, coming together as one — protecting each other’s health, even as we could no longer socialize.

Living under these conditions is difficult to describe. We can only leave the house out of medical necessity or to get food. We can go on short walks but not in groups. We can’t hug, kiss or shake hands with anyone outside of our family. We must stay at least four feet from everyone else, at all times.

My family tries to maintain a routine: In the mornings, I home-school our four children, who range from kindergarten to eighth grade, while my husband teleworks. My eldest son’s school was the best prepared for distance learning and began remote lessons from the first week of the lockdown. He gets live lessons, homework, regular interaction with his teachers — and just as importantly, regular interaction with friends, which lessens his sense of isolation. It’s great, really, but it also requires a dedicated laptop and bandwidth from 8:10 a.m. to 2:45 p.m. daily, limiting what everyone else can do online. My other children’s schools, which shut down at the same time, have only started distance learning this week.

In the afternoon, my husband and I both work as best we can, while the children keep themselves busy. With guitars we had on hand and a drum set they built from scratch, they’re putting together a garage band. (Literally — they have to stay in the garage and can’t practice or perform anywhere else.) For the first time in my life, I’ve come to think that having four children sometimes can be less work than having one or two: They can entertain each other.

Counterintuitively, the days somehow end incredibly fast. We are always doing something: organizing lessons, fighting with a malfunctioning printer or about our overloaded WiFi, tutoring each child one-on-one, getting the kids outside, feeding them, drinking coffee, repeat. When, after two or three days, we can’t take the confinement anymore, one of us makes a run to the grocery store to buy fruits and vegetables and whatever else we need. (The stores, at least, are well stocked.) We go out by bike to get some exercise. That, too, is a challenge, because we are always tired.

My mother and sisters, my little niece, my aunt, and cousins live in Lombardy, the region worst affected by the pandemic. If my mother, who is 81 (or almost 81, as she would point out) catches this virus, she will probably die. I speak to and text them frequently, but I don’t know when, or if, I will be able to see them. It’s bizarre: Everyone is going through the same emotions — fear, anger, exhaustion — no matter where we live or what we do. We don’t need many words to know how the other person feels. We end every call with “Forza!” We must keep going.

An illustrated look at Italy now

Yes, most people who become ill will survive. Yes, people younger than 45 will probably be fine. But right now, doctors across Northern Italy have to choose between who gets the respirator and lives, and who does not and dies. Italy’s health system, for all its shortcomings — the long waits for certain tests, some aging buildings, the sometimes crowded hospital wards — is among the best-performing in the Western world. A 2017 report by the World Health Organization, for example, reported that Italian health care has among the lowest mortality rates in Europe and a strong acute-care sector. And yet this virus has overwhelmed the health system of one of the richest areas of the European Union.

Statistics change daily, as the hospitals scramble to build capacity. On Thursday, there were only 737 intensive-care beds open for new coronavirus patients in Lombardy; the region is home to 10 million people, and as of this writing, 16,220 people have tested positive for the disease there. Depending on how many coronavirus patients go into or out of the hospitals each day, if you have a chronic condition or a heart attack or are in a car crash, you might not be able to access care.

Writing this from Italy, I am also writing to you from your own future. From our state of emergency, we have been watching the crisis unfold in the United States with a terrible sense of foreboding. Please stop waiting for others to tell you what to do; stop blaming the government for doing too much or too little. We all have actions we can take to slow the spread of the disease — and ensuring that your own household has enough canned goods and cleaning supplies is not enough. You can do a lot more. You should do a lot more. Stay away from restaurants, gyms, libraries, movie theaters, bars and cafes, yes. But also: Don’t invite people over for dinner, don’t let your kids go on playdates, don’t take them to the playground, don’t let your teenagers out of your sight. They will sneak out with their friends, they will hold hands, they will share their drinks and food. If this seems too much, consider the following: We are not allowed to hold weddings or funerals. We can’t gather to bury our dead.

For us, it might be too late to avoid an incredible loss of life. But if you decide against taking actions because it seems inconvenient, or because you don’t want to look silly, you can’t say you weren’t warned."

Democrats get to help the working class and solve a lot of inequalities among race, gender, etc.

Libertarians get to downsize inefficient government programs

Republicans get to lower abortion rates and revitalize religion (maslow's hierarchy of needs is met = more people donating their income)

Populists get to stick it to the rich elite, as poverty is solved overnight, and ""pulling yourself up by your bootstraps"" goes from being somewhat possible, to legitimately easy.

EVERYBODY WINS, NOBODY LOSES.

The only argument against UBI on an ethical level is ""what about the lazy people who just won't' work?"" And the answer is simple: Those people already aren't working. Forget them. 

I mean, really, who cares that some people will be lazy?

They just simply didn’t know enough about diseases. They had no idea how they spread, or have any idea how to treat them and hygiene was so bad in the cities that it was a breeding ground. Rats filled the streets and fleas would feed on them and bite humans, didn’t take long to start showing effects and then they would literally padlock you and your whole family in your house until you either died or got better, and basically anyone inside had their death warrant signed as soon as that door shut.

The doctors, the guards in charge of guarding the houses, gravediggers, everybody got sick because of it. Crazy time in history.

Edit: To get an idea of what they were working with... In London they legitimately thought the disease was being spread by the smell of the dirt/dead bodies so they got a bunch of different herbs and shit and had huge fires all over the city to get rid of the smells.

Plague doctors thought if they put herbs in the beak that it would keep them healthy... they just legit had no idea what they were doing. This was a time when basically any illness was almost certainly going to kill you no matter how trivial they are today.

> The policy is rooted in history. The last time the country faced a comparable mask shortage was during the 2009 H1N1 outbreak. To meet increased demand, Prestige Ameritech hired hundreds of new employees and expanded its manufacturing capabilities. But after the outbreak died down, Bowen says that most hospitals that had relied on Prestige Ameritech went back to Chinese suppliers, which typically sell masks and respirators for less than it costs him to produce.

> “In 2011, after the H1N1 pandemic ended, we had to lay off 150 people,” he recalls. “One hundred fifty people that saved a lot of hospitals from closing their doors were rewarded by losing their jobs. And that's not going to happen again.”

China is going to get the diplomatic version of a public lynching for this.  Their policies created this, and the current virus originated from the exact same source as the original SARS.

This is why China is already doing all this stuff like kicking out journalists and calling this a CIA weapon.  They know their proverbial beat down is coming.

Here's the second massive threat to China.  Their place as the world's manufacturer is at grave risk.  These shortages of ventilators, drugs, and other supplies is an issue that stems from them being the primary supplier of these goods.

Countries are going to bring this manufacturing back to their own soil.  They have to if they want to avoid national quarantines in the future.  The lack of medical supplies is the primary reason this is happening in Europe (and likely coming soon to the U.S.).  Bringing this manufacturing home allows for a rapid response to emergency and allows for a bell curve flattening without sacrificing the economy.

A lack of empathy. It’s the one characteristic that connects all the defendants, a genuine incapacity to feel with their fellow men.

"" Officials at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and epidemic experts from universities around the world conferred last month about what might happen if the new [coronavirus](https://www.nytimes.com/live/2020/coronavirus-update-03-13) gained a foothold in the United States. How many people might die? How many would be infected and need hospitalization?

One of the agency’s top disease modelers, Matthew Biggerstaff, presented the group on the phone call with four possible scenarios — A, B, C and D — based on characteristics of the virus, including estimates of how transmissible it is and the severity of the illness it can cause. The assumptions, reviewed by The New York Times, were shared with about 50 expert teams to model how the virus could tear through the population — and what might stop it.

The C.D.C.’s scenarios were depicted in terms of percentages of the population. Translated into absolute numbers by independent experts using simple models of how viruses spread, the worst-case figures would be staggering if no actions were taken to slow transmission.

Between 160 million and 214 million people in the United States could be infected over the course of the epidemic, according to a projection that encompasses the range of the four scenarios. That could last months or even over a year, with infections concentrated in shorter periods, staggered across time in different communities, experts said. As many as 200,000 to 1.7 million people could die."""

I could barely get out of bed or off the couch. Just wanted to sleep all the time. 3 weeks later I STILL have a bit of a cough. I was coughing so much (with hardly any flem(sp?) coming up that my diaphragm was super sore lol. This thing does not feel good no matter how fit you might be.

WASHINGTON — A federal government plan to combat the coronavirus warned policymakers last week that a pandemic “will last 18 months or longer” and could include “multiple waves,” resulting in widespread shortages that would strain consumers and the nation’s health care system.

The 100-page plan, dated Friday, the same day President Trump declared a national emergency, laid out a grim prognosis for the spread of the virus and outlined a response that would activate agencies across the government and potentially employ special presidential powers to mobilize the private sector.

Among the “additional key federal decisions” listed among the options for Mr. Trump was invoking the Defense Production Act of 1950, a Korean War-era law that authorizes a president to take extraordinary action to force American industry to ramp up production of critical equipment and supplies such as ventilators, respirators and protective gear for health care workers.

“Shortages of products may occur, impacting health care, emergency services, and other elements of critical infrastructure,” the plan warned. “This includes potentially critical shortages of diagnostics, medical supplies (including PPE and pharmaceuticals), and staffing in some locations.” P.P.E. refers to personal protective equipment.

The plan continued: “State and local governments, as well as critical infrastructure and communications channels, will be stressed and potentially less reliable. These stresses may also increase the challenges of getting updated messages and coordinating guidance to these jurisdictions directly.”

The plan, which was unclassified but marked “For Official Use Only // Not For Public Distribution or Release,” was shared with The New York Times as Mr. Trump escalated his efforts to curb the spread of the virus. After weeks of playing down the seriousness of the pandemic, saying it would miraculously disappear, Mr. Trump began shifting to a more sober tone during a news conference on Friday announcing the national emergency.

Much of the plan is bureaucratic in nature, describing coordination among agencies and actions that in some cases have already been taken, like urging schools to close and large events to be canceled. But its discussion of the Defense Production Act came as lawmakers and others urged Mr. Trump to invoke its powers.

“While the administration’s response has so far lacked the urgency this crisis has called for, there are still steps you can take to mitigate the damage,” Senator Bob Menendez, Democrat of New Jersey, wrote in a letter to Mr. Trump on Tuesday. “Invoking the powers vested in the DPA will enable the federal government to step up and take the type of aggressive steps needed in this time of uncertainty.”

Another letter sent last week by 57 House Democrats led by Representative Andy Levin of Michigan made similar points: “During World War II, our country adapted to the demands of the time to produce mass quantities of bombers, tanks, and many smaller items needed to save democracy and freedom in the world. We know what the demands of this time are, and we must act now to meet these demands.”
Senator Jack Reed, Democrat of Rhode Island, said that Defense Secretary Mark T. Esper told him on Tuesday that the Pentagon would provide federal health workers with five million respirator masks and 2,000 specialized ventilators. “The American public is on wartime footing in terms of battling the spread of this disease, and the Pentagon has to be part of the effort to help protect the health and safety of the American people,” Mr. Reed said.

But Mr. Trump said on Tuesday that he was not ready to invoke the Defense Production Act. “We’re able to do that if we have to,” he told reporters. “Right now, we haven’t had to, but it’s certainly ready. If I want it, we can do it very quickly. We’ve studied it very closely over two weeks ago, actually. We’ll make that decision pretty quickly if we need it. We hope we don’t need it. It’s a big step.”

Passed in 1950 shortly after American troops went to war defending South Korea against an invasion from North Korea, the Defense Production Act was based on powers used during World War II and authorized the president to require businesses to prioritize and accept contracts necessary for national defense.

Over the years, its scope has been expanded to include domestic preparedness and national emergencies. A president can make direct loans or loan guarantees and purchase commitments, subsidies or other incentives to influence industry to help in times of crisis.

Other key decisions outlined as options for the president include distributing medical supplies and equipment from the Strategic National Stockpile, providing money to states to help them meet demands caused by the coronavirus outbreak and prioritizing the distribution of essential resources to focus on areas most in need.

“The spread and severity of Covid-19 will be difficult to forecast and characterize,” the government plan said. It warned of “significant shortages for government, private sector, and individual U.S. consumers.”"

Just an FYI, I handle every single parcel that goes out to two zipcodes in a city of ~250,000.  I am not issued PPE and have begun to develop symptoms.  I do not recieve sick leave and will be likely terminated or recieve a permenant mark on my record but I am choosing to self quarantine.  I only hope that the handwashing and coughing into my elbow I did is enough to not spread this to everyone who's mail I handled.  The Post Office told me it was.

I also do not recieve health care even though I am a Federal Employee and will not be able to afford a $1000+ hospital expense as I only make $38k a year even with 50 hour work weeks.  Our Post Office has failed me, and it has failed the general public by choosing to ignore the pandemic in favor of a business as usual approach."

When you can't even buy a fucking candy bar and have to eat out of a Safeway dumpster how the fuck are you supposed to pay for a test people exponentially richer than you are being denied due to shortage/cost? Everything about this says she was desperate. She was probably forced by circumstance to wait for it to get bad and verify it wasn't something like cold or flu via living rough and praying. Then when it got bad enough to convince someone in that situation to seek care, no rational person in that situation would be able to survive the immediate debt and barely legal forced admittance charges, so hoping she was fine she probably escaped before the bills and debt servitude could kill her via immediate necessity to work off the copays and fees. Being immediately forced into debt servitude after a catastrophic medical event is typical fare for the U.S. houseless. But this is the first time that that practice can endanger an entire community rather than just that person and their circle. To go to the hospital when I was homeless *10 years ago* would cost over $1k out of pocket and that's with insurance!

2020-03-17,Scratchjackson,Coronavirus,36,https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/fkgsbo/a_chilling_scientific_paper_helped_upend_us_and/fksmpkc/," LONDON  — Immediately after Boris Johnson completed his Monday evening news  conference, which saw a somber prime minister encourage his fellow  citizens to avoid ""all nonessential contact with others,"" his aides  hustled reporters into a second, off-camera briefing.

That session  presented jaw-dropping numbers from some of Britain’s top modelers of  infectious disease, who predicted the deadly course of the [coronavirus](https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2020/02/28/what-you-need-know-about-coronavirus/?tid=lk_inline_manual_3&itid=lk_inline_manual_3)  could quickly kill hundreds of thousands in both the United Kingdom and  the United States, as surges of sick and dying patients overwhelmed  hospitals and critical care units.

The [new forecasts,](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/media/imperial-college/medicine/sph/ide/gida-fellowships/Imperial-College-COVID19-NPI-modelling-16-03-2020.pdf)  by Neil Ferguson and his colleagues at the Imperial College COVID-19  Response Team, were quickly endorsed by Johnson’s government to design  new and more extreme measures to suppress the spread of the virus.

The  report is also influencing planning by the Trump administration.  Deborah Birx, who serves as the coordinator of the White House  coronavirus task force, cited the British analysis at a news conference  Monday, saying her response team was especially focused on the report’s  conclusion that an entire household should self-quarantine for 14 days  if one of its members is stricken by the virus.

The Imperial  College London group reported that if nothing was done by governments  and individuals and the pandemic remained uncontrolled, 510,000 would  die in Britain and 2.2 million in the United States over the course of  the outbreak.

These kinds of numbers are deeply concerning for  countries with top-drawer health-care systems. They are terrifying for  less-developed countries, global health experts say.

If Britain  and the United States pursued more-ambitious measures to mitigate the  spread of the coronavirus, to slow but not necessarily stop the epidemic  over the coming few months, they could reduce mortality by half, to  260,000 people in the United Kingdom and 1.1 million in the United  States.

Finally, if the British government quickly went all-out to  suppress viral spread — aiming to reverse epidemic growth and reduce  the case load to a low level — then the number of dead in the country  could drop to below 20,000. To do this, the researchers said, Britain  would have to enforce social distancing for the entire population,  isolate all cases, demand quarantines of entire households where anyone  is sick, and close all schools and universities — and do this not for  weeks but for 12 to 18 months, until a vaccine is available.

“We might be living in a very different world for a year or more,” Ferguson told reporters.

The modelers did not give numbers for the United States for the most intense suppression efforts.

The  researchers reminded governments that these forecasts are based on  current observed trends in China, South Korea, Britain and Italy but  that much remains unknown about the virus.

The Imperial College  report, which was shared with the British government over the weekend  ahead of its official release Monday, was responsible in large part for  Johnson’s turnaround decision to begin rolling out what 10 Downing  Street described as life-altering, “drastic” measures to control the  spread of the novel coronavirus, aides said.

Johnson said the  virus “would overwhelm any health system in the world” if quarantines  and limits on social contact are not taken. “Although the measures we  have already announced are extreme, we may have to go further in the  coming days,” the prime minister said Tuesday.

[Johnson urged his fellow citizens](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/europe/uk-coronavirus-herd-immunity/2020/03/16/1c9d640e-66c7-11ea-b199-3a9799c54512_story.html?tid=lk_inline_manual_22&itid=lk_inline_manual_22) to immediately start to avoid “all nonessential contact with others,” work from home and self-  
isolate  now if they are elderly or suffer from underlying medical conditions.  The measures are still voluntary, but Johnson warned that his government  had the power to make them mandatory.

Johnson said that healthy  and asymptomatic Britons should avoid pubs, clubs and theaters. In  London, the bars were still open Monday. Most schools, museums and  restaurants were, too. But the prime minister said closing schools was  “under consideration.”

Roy Anderson, an infectious disease  specialist at Imperial College, who was not a part of the study, said  Britain probably had much more to do. “I don’t know if these measures  are enough yet,” he said. “And I wish we had done them last week.”

If Britain had continued on the go-slow, step-by-step course that [it set just days ago](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/europe/flatten-the-curve-coronavirus/2020/03/12/a648883c-6460-11ea-8a8e-5c5336b32760_story.html?tid=lk_inline_manual_28&itid=lk_inline_manual_28),  the Imperial College modeling envisioned hundreds of thousands of  deaths and a tidal wave of cases that would overwhelm the National  Health Service and its hospitals. There are currently 7,000 ventilators  available for all of England, the largest nation within the United  Kingdom, with a population of 56 million.

The British forecast  also influenced thinking at the White House. On Monday evening in  Washington, President Trump said that Americans should avoid gathering  in groups of more than 10 people, eating in restaurants or taking  nonessential trips — [his most significant push yet](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/coronavirus-trump-avoid-gatherings/2020/03/16/3af817a2-67b0-11ea-b313-df458622c2cc_story.html?tid=lk_inline_manual_29&itid=lk_inline_manual_29) to combat a viral outbreak.

At  a news conference Monday at the White House, Birx said her group has  been working with modelers around the globe, including in Britain.

“So,  we had new information coming out from a model, and what had the  biggest impact in the model is social distancing, small groups, not  going in public in large groups. But the most important thing was if one  person in the household became infected, the whole household  self-quarantined for 14 days. Because that stops 100 percent of the  transmission outside of the household,” she said.

To suppress  spread in Britain, widespread school and university closings might also  be necessary, though Ferguson worried about its impact on staffing at  NHS hospitals, where as many as a third of nurses have school-age  children, the Guardian newspaper reported.

In their forecast, the  modelers envision that strict measures over the coming months will  occasionally be loosened, but as soon as they are, viral spread could  come roaring back.

“The major challenge of suppression is that  this type of intensive intervention package . . . will need to be  maintained until a vaccine becomes available (potentially 18 months or  more), given that we predict that transmission will quickly rebound if  interventions are relaxed,” the study concludes.

“Intermittent  social distancing — triggered by trends in disease surveillance — may  allow interventions to be relaxed temporarily in relatively short time  windows, but measures will need to be reintroduced if or when case  numbers rebound,” the research team said."

- coronavirus outbreak occurs in Wuhan China 
- WSJ published an article entitled China is the Real Sick Man of Asia, angering the CCP 
- CCP expels certain WSJ journalists from China
- USA retaliates by designating certain Chinese state-owned media outlet operating in the US as foreign missions, and capped the number of employees they may hire in the US 
- CCP internet trolls, state media and foreign ministry start to aggressively promote the conspiracy theory that the coronavirus originated in the US, and the US military released it in Wuhan

1. DeBlasio locks it down.  People are only allowed to leave home for groceries, pharmacy, or emergencies.

2. The virus continues to spread, mostly asymptomatically, among those who go shopping for supplies.  They then spread it back to their families and roommates.  

3.  The R0 remains well above 1.0, and so the crisis continues to worsen as the spread is not stopped.

4.  The National Guard is called in to enforce centralized quarantine, no leaving your home AT ALL.  The National Guard delivers food, medicine, and supplies.  Those with fevers are separated from the healthy and delivered to central quarantine.

5.  The R0 dips below 1 and the spread abates.  

6. (possible) De Blasio tries to lift the quarantine too soon.  The spread restarts.  Repeat steps 1-5."

&#x200B;

**Shortest tl;dr:** SARS and COVID-19 infect via some shit called ACE-2 enzyme - they bind to cells because they stick to this shit. Diabetic medication, some blood pressure medication and ibuprofen increase this shit. It **could** (not does, but **could**) explain why people with diabetes and hypertension can have more serious infections. This data is why some drs (NHS also) are saying perhaps take Tylenol for a while instead of Ibuprofen. **BUT WAIT!!!** this shit is complicated, because ACE-2 also protects against lung damage and you need it. So delivered the right way (they're testing via injection mode) might help combat lung damage. We don't know enough yet.

Conclusion: don't panic, don't change any meds without express permission from doctor, just be aware, information is power. Only switch ibuprofen with tylenol/paracetamol for now, if you can.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Slightly more detailed tl;dr:** Human pathogenic coronaviruses (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus \[SARS-CoV\] and SARSCoV-2) bind to their target cells through angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which is expressed by epithelial cells of the lung, intestine, kidney, and blood vessels.

Comorbidities reported so far for severe coronavirus patients include hypertension and either type I or type II diabetes. These patients are often being treated with ACE-1 inhibitors or angiotensin-receptor antagonists. The tricky part is that both diabetes itself and treatment with either of those drug classes ***increases the expression of ACE-2 protein, which could explain why diabetics and those with hypertension can have more serious infections***. Ibuprofen also increases ACE-2, which is why some doctors are skeptical of how beneficial taking it could be, and recommend switching to acetaminophen/tylenol/paracetamol **until we know more**.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Not at all tl;dr, for those who enjoy reading a lot:**

I fell down this hole in my research trying to find out more about **why Ibuprofen** is causing such an uproar right now, with doctors saying to switch to Paracetamol/Tylenol while there not being enough data to know for sure if it's harmful.

The masks go to hospitals regardless of the term of the contract. 

Is he using this to his advantage? Yeah, but he learned the lesson the last time he trusted purchasers to take care of him if he took care of them. Perhaps there wouldn't be as much of a shortage now, if we didn't offshore manufacturing after the last time this company stepped up manufacturing.

Last time the Fed's inflation went into the stock market. This time it will chase prices and will go into the supermarket and consumer goods creating massive inflation. This will leave the average everyday American holding the bags once again, and flipping the bill with more taxes in order to bailout the banks, corporations who bought back their own stock with debt and issuing bonds, and the people who leveraged up in debt are rewarded. What we need is limited governments not more of big Government and bailouts. We are headed towards a Stagflation/Inflationary depression after a massive deflation of assets."

A paper released this week in the journal Pediatrics, based on 2,143 young people in China, provides the most extensive evidence on the spread of the virus in children, and there is bad news and good news.
The study provides confirmation that coronavirus infections are in fact generally less severe in kids, with more than 90 percent having mild to moderate disease or even being asymptomatic. But it contains worrisome information about one subset — infants — and suggests that children may be a critical factor in the disease’s rapid spread.
AD

The first thing to know is that children are getting infected across all age groups and genders. Among the patients studied, half were from Hubei Province, the epicenter of the outbreak, while the others were from bordering areas. They ranged in age from newborns to 18 with the median age being 7 years.
So what does coronavirus look like in children?
Surge in coronavirus patients threatens to swamp U.S. hospitals

According to the analysis by Shanghai Children’s Medical Center researchers Yuanyuan Dong, Xi Mo and co-authors, mild cases (52 percent) were marked by the typical symptoms of a cold — fever, fatigue, cough, sore throat, runny nose and sneezing. Some patients had no fever and only digestive symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain and diarrhea.
AD

Those with moderate infection (39 percent) had pneumonia with frequent fever and cough, mostly dry cough, followed by a wetter cough. Some had wheezing but no obvious shortness of breath.
Severe cases were rare (5 percent) as were those who required critical care (0.4 percent.) The severe cases began with early respiratory symptoms which were sometimes accompanied by gastrointestinal issues. Around one week the children have more difficulty breathing. Those cases sometimes quickly progressed to critical illness with acute respiratory distress or failure which in turn sometimes led to other organ dysfunction — heart failure or kidney injury.
One boy, a 14-year-old, died on Feb. 7. No further details on the patient were revealed in the study.
AD

Of special interest to pediatricians is a group of seven infants (11 percent of the total number of infants in the study), and two children in the age 1 to 5 range (15 percent), who progressed to critical condition. The study suggests, the authors wrote, that “young children, particularly infants, were vulnerable.”
The luckiest group — 4 percent — did not have any symptoms at all even as nasal or throat swabs showed they were positive for coronavirus infection.
“Why most of the children’s COVID-19 cases were less severe than adults’ case is puzzling,” Dong and Mo wrote. “This may be related to both exposure and host factors.""
The researchers wrote that children may have been more isolated at home after the outbreak began, and therefore had fewer opportunities to be exposed to the pathogens. They also suggested that there was something in the children’s biology — a cell receptor that binds to the virus — that might be less sensitive. Another theory is that children often experience colds and other respiratory infections in winter so they may have come into the season with higher levels of antibodies, which are protective, than adults.
AD

The Pediatrics editors wrote they were releasing the paper early, within days of it having been peer reviewed but before official publication, due to the topic’s importance. In a commentary accompanying the study, associate editors Andrea Cruz and Steve Zeichner, both physicians, say the study suggests “children may play a major role in community-based viral transmission.”
The data suggests they may have more symptoms that make them contagious, like runny nose, and that they may have more gastrointestinal symptoms which raises concerns for the virus being in the feces for several weeks after infection.
How to manage screen time for kids as coronavirus closes schools

As schools move to online teaching, students will be spending extra time in front of a screen. Clinical psychologist Nicole Beurkens has some pointers. (Allie Caren/The Washington Post)
“Prolonged shedding in nasal secretions and stool has substantial implications for community spread in day-care centers, schools, and in the home,” Cruz, a pediatrician from the Baylor College of Medicine, and Zeichner, an immunologist from the University of Virginia, wrote.
AD

Adam Ratner, a doctor in pediatric infectious diseases at NYU Langone Health, said the outbreak in China represents only a small percentage of those who will eventually become infected and when the group gets larger “we’ll see more serious cases on the fringes.”
He said the clear takeaway from the study is that coronavirus “is still something that has the ability to cause severe disease across the age spectrum.” He said his hospital and his colleagues’ around the United States were “taking the idea of covid-19 in children very seriously.”
“We’re learning more and more about this disease every day for better or for worse,” he said. “It’s still very early days.”"

Rabies is a virus and can drastically affect the behavior of people. Not only does it increase aggression, but also makes it so people become “hydrophobic” that some individuals will gag just by being presented with a glass of water. Although, rabies directly affects the nervous system, and I have not heard of COVID doing so."

Ainsley Earhardt needs to be pulled off the air for her incompetent and irresponsible reporting.   I have Trump supporting, Fox News watching family and as much frustration as this gives me, everyone deserves the truth.  It's the people who are misinformed making poor choices and causing this virus to spread more.  It will lead to people dying. They are 1000% responsible for the information they are giving the public.   

There needs to be consequences and accountability now.  Lives depend on it."
