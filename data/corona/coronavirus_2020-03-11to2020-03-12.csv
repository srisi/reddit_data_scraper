""As a result"" of Europe's inaction, Trump said, ""a large number of clusters"" of coronavirus ""were seeded by travelers from Europe.""

But but but... That's false. (I'm European.) We took hard measures, and probably harder measures than the US. We stopped most flights to China really early. We quarantined thousand of people coming back from infected areas. We traced down every chain of infection, doing tens of thousands of tests. People have been assigned at home if there was any suspicion they were in contact. Closed schools, stopped public rallies, had sports events without public or cancelled. Everything wasn't perfect, but those measures were taken here and not in the US.

It's the opposite that is true. The US hasn't taken any serious measure and has let the virus spread countrywide. They don't even have a clue of how much cases there are on their own territory. Serious studies said they should have been around 9000 cases at the begining of March, so now the US is probably around 40 000 cases. When this truth will emerge, it will be total panic and already too late. And with a broken health system on top of that...

How can you blame foreign nations and trigger a worldwide meltdown for your own faults. The US government has been the most inconsequent worldwide and for its fault, this is going to be catastrophic, while the worst could have been avoided.

Ok, thanks for the upcoming financial crisis, enjoy your martial law one week from now, and don't forget to blame us."

* The president also said he’ll take “emergency action” to provide relief to workers who are affected. He said he’s asking Congress for $50bn for small business loans. He also called for “immediate” payroll tax cuts.

* He also downplayed warnings of a potential recession: “This is not a financial crisis, this is just a temporary moment of time that we will overcome as a nation and as a world,” he said.

* Trump temporarily suspends travel from Europe to the US The restrictions will not apply to the UK, he said. The travel restriction will start Friday, and last for 30 days amid virus outbreak.

* Trump also encouraged older Americans to avoid all travel if possible. He reviewed other measures his administration is taking to address the pandemic.

* Trump also encouraged older Americans to avoid travel if possible. Older people “must be very, very careful,” he said, calling on nursing homes to suspend “medically unnecessary visits.”


* “The vast majority of Americans, the risk is very, very low,” he said. But he said that older Americans should avoid travel, and endorsed social distancing and avoiding large gatherings. “Every community faces different risks,” he noted and encouraged Americans to listen to local officials.

* In his brief address, the president continued to signal that the pandemic is mainly a threat outside American borders, without fully acknowledging that the coronavirus is spreading within the US.


* Trump said that the US is doing better than Europe. “The EU failed to take the same precautions and restrict travel from China and other hot spots,” he said. “As a result, a large number of new clusters in the United States were seeded by travelers from Europe.”

* Trump said that the US is doing better than Europe, but whereas European nations have rolled out widespread testing, it’s still unclear how many cases we’ve had in America."

Not the illness itself. The chaos.

They’re apparently more concerned about people panicking, coming to the hospital with a cold, staying because they demand to be treated and then walk out with Coronavirus, which will make them a little more ill than a cold.

Added, she mentioned that the doctors reckon that obese people that smoke and are in their mid seventies are seriously at risk, which means a lot of Americans might die but are people that were likely going to die soon anyway.

Apparently politicians who need to be seen to be doing something, anything, and the 24 hour news cycle, desperate for panic causing attention headlines that sell advertising are going to make this a lot, lot, lot worse.

1. Coronavirus could be much much work as far as pandemics go. This is exactly the event our species needed to be able to restructure around the eventuality of a more dangerous and deadly but equally contagious pathogen.
2. For a world that was slowly killing itself with CO2, we're now significantly cutting a lot of consumption, particularly of fossil fuels.
3. There's a TON of exciting and promising stuff being worked on. Protein sources grown from thin air using nothing but solar, CO2, and water? Multiple firms working on this, which will be both much lower energy usage per calorie and much more ethical. The development in quantum physics over the past few years is just *insane* - the tech we are discovering today is going to revolutionize our society in the next 20 years. Multiple diseases have reduced their mortality rate significantly in the past decade (such as melanoma), and in particular gene editing as a potential treatment vector may prove to be the biggest advancement in treatment since the discovery of antibiotics.

I get it. Bad news gets clicks, so that's what you are constantly seeing. But believe it or not, things are pretty incredible and there is a great deal of balance in the world, with the trend towards improvement.

We're going to be fine overall. Things suck, but they suck a lot less than compared to other periods in history, and our future looks to make the present appear barbaric by comparison (which is a good thing)."

* Emergency funds subsidizing paid sick leave, especially targeted at service industries or hourly workers.
* Any kind of deferral measures on federal student debt/agency mortgages.
* SBA loan deferrals or extensions (which was sort of mentioned).
* Expansion of unemployment insurance and eligibility.
* Subsidizing coronavirus treatment medical care.

I'm speaking to investor clients daily (in major sellside eq research for payments and fintech). The primary worry in the market right now amongst the institutional players is about the consumer. It's been the unstoppable force over the past couple of years and end of Jan there was unbridled optimism about how nothing was set to change the strength of it. This throws everything into question and investors were hoping to see measures from the federal government that make sure the wheels keep spinning and the impact on consumer velocity remains muted. A payroll tax holiday would be mildly positive for the consumer but it's going to exacerbate the income inequality over a period of time.

I'd bet many people have gotten coronavirus and were not aware they got it, which is both good and bad news. There are actually already reported cases in China where workers were tested positive for coronavirus and many of them *were* entirely unaware that they had it due to feeling close to no symptoms (I can search for the link if you want it).

Those would be the ""mild"" cases. Experiencing pneumonia and difficulty breathing is, according to the CDC, experienced with 'moderate' cases and is much less common than mild. Even less common is 'severe', which can include organ failure and requires immediate medical care. 

It's scary, and I mean no offense to the author, but making this seem like the general experience is exaggerated and will only spread more fear. Stay out of large public spaces or unneeded social gatherings and wash your hands, the odds of this happening to you are slim."

Job losses have begun in ports, bakeries and travel agencies. Economists worry more layoffs are coming as businesses see plummeting sales.

The coronavirus outbreak is taking a deep toll on the U.S. economy, prompting hundreds of layoffs over the past week alone and halting a historic 11-year bull market in stocks.
Strong job growth and soaring financial markets have fueled the U.S. economic expansion over the past decade. Now the rapid market decline and initial layoffs are heightening fears that the longest economic expansion in U.S. history could come to a sudden end, just a month after unemployment stood at a half-century low.

The Dow Jones industrial average lost 1,465 points, or 5.9 percent, Wednesday with every sector slumping after the World Health Organization designated the coronavirus a pandemic. The Dow closed in bear market territory, meaning it had shed more than 20 percent from its high less than a month ago.

Airlines, hotels, travel agencies and event companies have all been suffering, but interviews with more than two dozen firms and workers reveal that the pain is now translating into layoffs in a wider circle of industries, including a bakery and a chain restaurant.

At the Port of Los Angeles, 145 drivers have been laid off and others have been sent home without pay as massive ships from China stopped arriving and work dried up. At travel agencies in Atlanta and Los Angeles, several workers lost their jobs as bookings evaporated. Christie Lites, a stage-lighting company in Orlando, laid off more than 100 of its 500 workers nationwide this past week and likely will lay off 150 more, according to chief executive Huntly Christie. Meanwhile a hotel in Seattle is closing an entire department, a former employee said, and as many as 50 people lost their jobs after the South by Southwest festival in Austin got canceled.

Economists fear more layoffs in the coming weeks as supply chains come to a halt and people stay home and spend less.

We will definitely see an effect on jobs from the coronavirus, and it could be pretty large in leisure and hospitality,” said Julia Pollak, labor economist at ZipRecruiter. “The first thing we’ll see is a reduction in hours. We hear many reports of employers canceling staff everywhere except in health care.”

Monday in Los Angeles, Sam Creighton and about 20 colleagues were fired from the China Visa Service Center. Creighton helped Americans get travel documents to China, but business plummeted as groups and individuals canceled trips to Asia out of virus fear. The company processed around 400 visas a month; in February, that number fell to 22. The visa center did not return a request for comment.

“This job was my paycheck,” said Creighton, 27, who worked at the company for about three years. “I really don’t know what to do next.""

Baiden King lost her job at Carson’s Cookie Fix bakery in Omaha on Tuesday because online sales and customer traffic dried up dramatically — especially after the state’s first case of covid-19 was reported nearby. The company didn’t return a request for comment. King said her manager told her when she showed up for her shift that morning she had no choice. King made $11 an hour.

If my job’s laying off people, I can only imagine other employers are as well,” said King, who is preparing to move back in with her parents. “I’m not sure anyone will be hiring.”
These early coronavirus-related jobs cuts appear to have mostly affected younger, entry-level employees and gig workers. Workers receiving pink slips said they have no idea whether these layoffs will be permanent and that it is nearly impossible to look for another job right now, with many companies instituting hiring freezes. Uncertainty is high, and as people lose jobs — or fear losing jobs — they typically scale back spending even more, which has a ripple effect on local economies.

For example, the Port of Los Angeles, the busiest port in the United States, has become a “ghost town,” four workers said. They said the port has never been this quiet, not even during the Great Recession.

The ongoing lack of cargo prompted Shippers Transport Express to send layoff notices at the end of February to 145 drivers who transport containers from the port to corporate warehouse hubs. The company told workers there is a “near shutdown” of its operations at the port “for the foreseeable future.” Many factories closed in China, stunting shipments to the United States.

I’ve been working the ports for 13 years, and I’ve never seen anything like this,” said Randy L. Williams, a trucker for Shippers Transport Express. “I’m glad I didn’t buy a house yet.”

He said the port typically handles over 1,000 containers a night at his part of the operation, including some Walmart products, but is down to 200. He didn’t work at all last week and it’s been spotty this week.
Williams has dipped into his savings, and money is tight with a son in college. But he has union benefits and is applying for unemployment insurance. He also saved from years of $29-an-hour pay. Not everyone at the port has that situation.

Josue Alvarez drives for another company operating at the port, XPO Logistics, but is classified as an independent contractor, meaning he gets no vacation, sick days or health insurance. He pays for his truck and all related expenses. He typically makes $2,000 a week, but since mid-February has made $300 a week, an income he cannot survive on for long.

There’s a lot of uncertainty right now. My dispatchers say it will get worse before it gets better,” said Alvarez, who is 26 and lives with his parents. His father is also a trucker at the port. They show up early every day hoping for work but in the past two weeks almost always get sent home with no pay.
“The disruption to trade will be felt well beyond the dock workers,” said Stephen Levy, senior economist at the Center for Continuing Study of the California Economy. “Half of China’s goods come to the Port of Los Angeles. That will be felt by warehouse workers, truckers and people in the wholesale trade.”

The slowdown of goods moving across the country is hitting United Parcel Services hard, as drivers in Los Angeles have had their hours and pay scaled back. Ron Herrera, director of the Teamsters Port Division, the union representing UPS drivers, cited a decline in shipments because of coronavirus. A UPS spokesman said it was a “routine” staffing adjustment and that those drivers “are allowed to work at either a full- or a part-time” UPS facility.

Major airlines, weathering a massive decline in travelers, have not started layoffs, but nearly all have canceled routes and many have put on a hiring freeze, said Sara Nelson, international president of the Association of Flight Attendants-CWA, AFL-CIO, which represents about 50,000 flight attendants at 20 airlines.

“It’s just like a factory,” Nelson said. “When it slows down, and they cut all of the overtime hours, that is a massive pay cut for people right off the top.”

As consumers and businesses begin to pull back on spending, gig workers and independent contractors are having a particularly tough time. They are caught in limbo: Work is drying up, meaning they are effectively laid off, but they do not get to collect unemployment insurance. A payroll tax cut President Trump has proposed would not help them.

It’s kind of like I’m laid off but I’m not,” said Chad Denick, 35, who was told Monday he no longer needed to report to his job as a catering contractor for a tech company because employees would be working from home for the rest of the month. “But this is what I know: I don’t have a job at least until April.”
Denick stopped going out to restaurants and scaled back on purchases, like the $20 phone-charging mat he picked up a few days ago.

Spending behavior changes like that are one of the reasons, restaurant chains are starting to feel the crunch. Buca di Beppo, the Italian restaurant chain owned by Planet Hollywood, has begun laying off sales managers around the country, according to a former employee. Neither Buca di Beppo nor Planet Hollywood responded to a request for comment.

The cancellation of major conferences, including South by Southwest, Austin’s annual tech, music and film festival, also has created ripple effects of lost gigs. For Elle Mahoney, a freelance stage manager and producer, the South by Southwest cancellation knocked out 10 percent of her income. She just got engaged but is not planning or picking a wedding date.

“Everything is just on hold,” said Mahoney, 35, who is reaching out to people she used to nanny for to help make up lost pay. “It’s just really hard for us to depend on money from gig to gig.”

The economic strain is also starting to slow down and even freeze hiring that was in the works. In Kansas City, Mo., Sherry Caserta owns Travel Employment Agency, and she’s fielding a flood of phone calls, telling potential applicants their chances of landing a new job “are limited right now” as job postings are evaporating.
“The layoffs are already happening,” she said. “Most of these are last-hired, first-fired situations, but I’m really seeing it pick up this week in big cities: Atlanta, New York, Chicago.”"

As you know from previous communications, university leadership has been closely following events and public health recommendations surrounding the outbreak and spread of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19). The university has been busy planning and preparing for the possibility of transitioning to an online teaching and learning environment to help manage the potential spread of COVID-19.  

Although there are no confirmed cases of COVID-19 at ASU at this time, we know that many members of the ASU community have been traveling this week during spring break to parts of the country and world where there may be community spread of COVID-19. As a precaution, we have made the decision to transition in-person classes to online instruction wherever possible.

Effective Monday, March 16, the following changes will occur:

* All in-person classes wherever possible will transition to online instruction. Classes will continue in this mode for two weeks, at which time the university will assess where things stand with COVID-19. Additional information will follow shortly with specific instruction for faculty and students on how to transition to online instruction.
 
* The university remains open. University housing, computer labs, food service, health clinics, counseling services, research labs and all other aspects of the university remain open.
 
* All public events will continue unless otherwise announced.  

We are taking these steps out of an abundance of caution. Public health officials have not yet made this a requirement for public institutions. Nevertheless, given all that we know and what we can anticipate based on information from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, we believe this is the most prudent course of action at the current time.

ASU’s COVID-19 webpage will continue to be our primary source of information and updates related to university operations. We will communicate changes across as many channels as possible, and we have teams of individuals across the university ready to assist faculty and students with the transition to online instruction.  

The spread of COVID-19 may necessitate changes in the way we interact, but it does not change what we do. ASU will continue to operate and will continue to deliver the highest-quality education possible to the students we serve, and ASU employees will continue to perform their duties.

This is a new challenge not only for our community at ASU, but for the broader community in metropolitan Phoenix, Arizona, and the country. We will continue to closely monitor the COVID-19 situation with local, state and federal public health officials.

In the meantime, please carry on with your work and your studies. Do so with care for yourself and for those around you and continue to adhere to the preventative measures as recommended by public health officials, but do not retreat from your commitment to your education and to the important work you do every day. And again, additional information will follow shortly with specific instruction for faculty and students about this transition."

The infection rate ranged from 0.1 percent of the population to 50 percent. That put the range of deaths at 327 (best case) to 1,635,000 (worst case). The deaths would not necessarily happen over a month or a year, but could occur over two or three years, he said.

The worst case probably will not happen, that’s why it’s the “worst case” and not “middle of the bell curve” case.  But you still need to be cognizant of it."

>The World Health Organization has determined that multiple countries within the Schengen Area are experiencing sustained person-to-person transmission of SARS-CoV-2.

The Schengen Area currently has the largest number of confirmed COVID-19 cases outside of the People's Republic of China. As of March 11, 2020, the number of cases in the 26 Schengen Area countries is 17,442, with 711 deaths, and shows high continuous growth in infection rates. In total, as of March 9, 2020, the Schengen Area has exported 201 COVID-19 cases to 53 countries.

virus difficult.

>The United States Government is unable to effectively evaluate and monitor all of the travelers continuing to arrive from the Schengen Area. The potential for undetected transmission of the virus by infected individuals seeking to enter the United States from the Schengen Area threatens the security of our transportation system and infrastructure and the national security. Given the importance of protecting persons within the United States from the threat of this harmful communicable disease, I have determined that it is in the interests of the United States to take action to restrict and suspend the entry into the United States, as immigrants or nonimmigrants, of all aliens who were physically present within the Schengen Area during the 14-day period preceding their entry or attempted entry into the United States. The free flow of commerce between the United States and the Schengen Area countries remains an economic priority for the United States, and I remain committed to facilitating trade between our nations.

So it's not just the UK that's exempt from the restriction, but also a number of other countries in Europe:

* Albania
* Andorra
* Armenia
* Azerbaijan
* Belarus
* Bosnia & Herzegovina
* Bulgaria
* Croatia
* Cyprus
* Georgia
* Ireland
* Kazakhstan
* Kosovo
* Moldova
* Monaco
* Montenegro
* North Macedonia
* Romania
* Russia
* San Marino
* Serbia
* Turkey
* Ukraine
* The United Kingdom

That being said, I'd imagine that most people in, say, the Vatican aren't going to travel from there to the US without traveling through the Schengen Area.

Guess that it gets to be the guys in the Romanian branch office doing the business trips to America for a while...

By David C. Unger  

March 11, 2020  
1:44 PM

Camogli, Italy — 

Under  other circumstances, being homebound here might not seem a bad thing.  Not for nothing is this stretch of the Italian Riviera  called the Golfo Paradiso, the Gulf of Paradise. From our apartment, my wife and I look  out at the Mediterranean, the nearby city of Genoa and the snow-capped  mountains beyond. Now, with no one supposed to leave home, there are no  errands to run, grace periods have been granted on mortgage, utility and  tax bills. My shelves bulge with books that I now have more time to  read.

But these circumstances are horrific. Italy is living  through a national tragedy of incomprehensible proportions. More than  10,000 people here are ill with the [coronavirus](https://www.latimes.com/california/liveblog/coronavirus-live-updates) and more than 800 have died. Things could get worse, much worse, before they get better.

And no one knows when this will end.

This region, known as Liguria, is not the worst hit, but is just  south of the areas that are. On Saturday, March 7, our streets and  beaches teemed with tourists from the colder cities of the north. On  Sunday morning, the government ordered the northern regions most  affected by the virus sealed off. Two days later [the whole country](https://www.latimes.com/world-nation/story/2020-03-10/coronavirus-has-turned-italy-into-a-beautiful-prison) was locked down.

On  Wednesday night, Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte announced the nationwide  closure of all shops, except food stores and pharmacies. Now our  streets and beaches are deserted, with most of the locals behind closed  doors.

It has come to this even though Italy moved early and  aggressively against the coronavirus threat with what it thought were  strict measures of containment. When two travelers, who arrived in Italy  from Wuhan, China, tested positive, they were quarantined and further  flights from China were banned. When a new cluster of cases emerged in  northern Italy in late February, the government moved quickly to  blockade all areas of known infection, sealing off some 50,000 people in  11 northern municipalities. But what seemed unusually strict soon  turned out to be not strict enough.

The virus had moved beyond a limited number of locations with a  limited number of people who had been in direct or indirect contact with  China or other foreign hot spots. It had turned into “community  spread,” infecting people who had not traveled anywhere but had picked  up the virus at the end of a longer chain of transmission.

Now the  Italian government asks everyone in Italy to stay home, keep a distance  of at least one meter from others,  to not shake hands or hug  when  greeting people. It also advises washing hands frequently because the  virus can stay alive outside the body and is present in droplets from  coughing or even exhaling. A main route of transmission is when people  touch surfaces that have virus-laden droplets and then touch their eyes,  noses or mouths.

To be extra cautious, I chat with my neighbors  mainly by Facebook Messenger to avoid face-to-face contact. Yet I am  able to do full and frequent advisory sessions with graduate students at  my university, hundreds of miles away, with Apple’s FaceTime. In the  age of the internet and social media, isolation is not what it once  would have been, at least for those with online connections.

There are huge economic and social consequences to shutting down a  whole country of 60 million people, telling everyone to stay home and  enforcing restrictions on even short-range travel.

But the most  profound crisis, and the one that is driving the government toward all  these restrictions, is the potential overwhelming of Italy’s hospital  system, particularly intensive care. If not soon checked, this epidemic  could lead to triage decisions that would potentially require rationing  emergency care to those with the best underlying health and with the  longest remaining life expectancy.

There is special concern about  the virus spreading to southern Italy, with its lower number of current  coronavirus cases but much thinner medical infrastructure. But local  officials report that areas of the north, like Lombardy, are already  close to being overwhelmed. And with Italian hospitals stretched to  capacity caring for coronavirus victims, other medical needs are going  unattended.

Italy is now a test case for the rest of Europe and  perhaps the U.S. as well. Learning the right lessons from Italy’s  current trials is now a matter of life and death."

People are coming across the border all the time from the US, a place with incredibly lax testing. There's no way to prevent this virus from spreading here.

By the time the first few case(s) at McGill presents themselves, it will already be too late. By that point, it would have spread too quickly with a high probability of sustained community transmission. We're students. We're young. We'll probably be asymptomatic at first. 

There are ~~6906~~ 7017 signatories to a petition politely requesting for classes to be moved online for a short duration, a request that is not unreasonable given the circumstances.

Tom Hanks said on Wednesday that he and his wife, Rita Wilson, learned they had the coronavirus. The 63-year-old Academy Award-winning actor is in Australia, where he was set to film a movie about the life of Elvis Presley.
“Hello, folks. Rita and I are down here in Australia,” Mr. Hanks said in a statement. “We felt a bit tired, like we had colds, and some body aches. Rita had some chills that came and went. Slight fevers too. To play things right, as is needed in the world right now, we were tested for the coronavirus, and were found to be positive.”
He added that he and Ms. Wilson “will be tested, observed and isolated for as long as public health and safety requires.”
“Not much more to it than a one-day-at-a-time approach, no? We’ll keep the world posted and updated,” he said.

Hanks is playing the role of Colonel Tom Parker, Presley’s eccentric manager who groomed the famous singer to stardom in the 1950s. Production on the film, which is being directed by Baz Luhrmann, is set to begin filming on Monday.
“The health and safety of our company members is always our top priority, and we are taking precautions to protect everyone who works on our productions around the world,” Warner Bros., the studio behind the film, said in a statement.
Australia has had more than 120 cases confirmed cases of coronavirus as of Wednesday.

Italian here so I know what I'm talking about as we're currently the nation with the highest amount of confirmed cases and we're in a complete lockdown. I too used to believe that coronavirus wasn't such a big issue as the odds of dying if you are relatively young and don't have any other condition are so low. But the problem is, not worrying about getting the virus as you probably wouldn't die or even feel sick because of it is what you have to absolutely avoid. You have to think that maybe you wouldn't die, but if you get it you increase the possibility of it spreading, you can put in danger people who could actually suffer greatly. I live with my grandpa who is 82 years old, I'm 19. If I contract the virus I won't die but he likely will. My girlfriend's mom has an autoimmune disease, if she or her father contracts it it's gonna be a problem. We can't even go outside anymore, I can't stay with her for who knows how long, it's really hard, but in times like these we really can't be selfish. I totally agree that mass hysteria caused by the virus is insane though, we just need to follow a few simple rules and there is absolutely no reason to panic, but I just wanted to tell people that's it's not just about the numbers, like I myself used to believe."

""ID Students,

As you may be aware, universities in different parts of the country are taking steps to ensure public health safety. As of today, Georgia Tech leaders continue to work hard to prepare for the potential of significant temporary changes to our daily routine. The Institute is still functioning under normal working hours and schedules, but this ongoing and developing nationwide public health mitigation for the Coronavirus requires that we all be on our toes.

With that said, please be prepared to be nimble. This means that you should plan to take personal items left in labs and studios with you as early as today. This could include laptops, chargers, books, and project materials. Please remove any food so that it is not an obstacle for cleaning workers.

The Coronavirus situation remains fluid, and although unfortunate and less than ideal, we should try to remain positive and resilient. We’re here for our students and we will certainly do everything in our hands to protect your health, ensure your safety, and deliver on the learning outcomes we are committed to.

Please reach out to the ID staff team at any point should you have any concerns or questions.

[Except now the US is suspending all travel from Europe \(excluding the UK?\) for the next 30 days](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/11/world/coronavirus-news.html) which means not only are some people's elderly, immuno-compromized, or guests from Level 3 countries not going to make it to their big days but also perfectly healthy family and friends from countries without major outbreaks at this moment. 

This is also not taking into account that this sub isn't 100% people in the US. There are brooms on here from other countries that are closer to the larger outbreaks who will be more affected. 

We're seeing mass shutdowns of major events across the country so it's not overreacting to consider that our small but important events are going to be affected.

I guess some in this thread just had difficulties understanding China’s measures to effectively contain the Coronavirus, possibly due to culture,bias or whatever. It is one thing watching the news of lockdown or strict measures, another how the government and people are using every approach to contain the virus. Every one of the approaches may contribute a bit and they become very effective all together. Some of these approaches may be hard to copy in western countries. Like it or not, I am certain to say that Italy’s lockdown is less effective than china’s lockdown.

1) He pretty much said European travellers are to blame for the virus being in the US.. Clearly that's the case and not because hardly anyone in the USA has been tested for it 🙄

2) I'm going to guess a European travel ban won't do much given the numbers are already there in the US. And what's the point of doing a European ban but then exclude the UK.. coronavirus is here too and the number of infected are increasing rapidly.

3) Trump sounds VERY wheezy."

Like many of you, we have been following the developments of the coronavirus (COVID-19) very closely. We recognize the tremendous anxiety our community is feeling. In recent communications, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the World Health Organization have emphasized the importance of taking active measures to contain the spread of the virus in communities and mitigate the risk to vulnerable populations. As a world leader in public health and the metro region’s largest employer, Emory has a special responsibility to heed this guidance.

Schools and units across the university have been working to respond to the challenges that are emerging around COVID-19. We are working on a daily basis to ensure that Emory is well-prepared for situations that could impact us directly while delivering on the promise to protect the health and safety of our entire community, which is paramount. We write today to provide an update on mid-term changes that will limit the exposure of the coronavirus in our university community. Our approach is informed by our own experts in public health and emergency response and the evolving guidance of the CDC and the Georgia Department of Public Health.

***Effective immediately, Emory University will extend spring break for students until Sunday, March 22, 2020, and transition to remote learning for graduate and undergraduate classes on Monday, March 23*****, 2020.**

***Residential learning will be suspended for the remainder of the semester while the university remains open.***

**ACADEMIC AND RESIDENTIAL LIFE**

We will extend spring break until Sunday, March 22, and transition to remote learning for graduate and undergraduate classes on Monday, March 23. Students who are able should remain at home following the break. 

* All students residing in Emory residential facilities should collect belongings and move out of their spaces between now and Sunday, March 22 at 5:00 p.m. Residential facilities will close at this time and will remain closed for the spring semester.
* Residence Life and Housing Operations will be following up with residential students with specific instructions. Students who may have housing related extenuating circumstances can contact [housing@emory.edu](mailto:housing@emory.edu) for additional assistance.
* Students can expect to hear from their faculty about plans for the continuation of their classes.
* Faculty should expect to hear from their deans’ offices about school and college plans for transitioning to remote learning.
* The university is developing contingency plans for students and faculty who might need technical assistance and support during and through the transition to remote learning.  

**EMORY STAFF**

Given the altered learning environment, Emory staff should be guided by their unit or school leadership regarding work status and other updates as they become available.

**EVENTS**

We recommend canceling all gatherings not essential to the academic mission in order to reduce the risk of exposure to and transmission of the virus. This guidance is rapidly evolving, as we work with a panel of subject matter experts to determine the best actions to protect our community. We anticipate releasing additional guidance regarding events in the next 24-48 hours, and staff can expect to receive more information from their supervisors concerning work status, telecommuting options, timing, and other updates as they become available.

**TRAVEL**

Emory continues the indefinite suspension of all official and previously authorized travel for students, faculty and staff to China, Iran, Italy and South Korea. Given the dynamic nature of the outbreak, we strongly recommend that all Emory faculty, students, and staff reconsider domestic and international travel, especially for senior members of the community and individuals at increased risk for severe illness. We anticipate releasing additional guidance related to travel restriction in the next 24-48 hours.

The decision to transition to remote learning, limit events, and offer telecommuting options is consistent with CDC guidelines to prevent the further spread of COVID-19 and reflect similar actions from peer institutions. We carefully considered all options to ensure that our entire community can feel safe in these uncertain times. We appreciate your flexibility, patience, and commitment to our community as we navigate the path forward together.  While we do not have all of the answers to the very many questions that will naturally follow from our decision to take these measures to protect our community and those in the greater Atlanta region, we pledge to keep you informed as the path forward becomes clear. Please watch for future communications and expect that regular updates will appear on the university’s dedicated website:[Coronavirus Updates for the Emory Community](https://news.emory.edu/stories/2020/01/er_tn_coronavirus/campus.html).

Sincerely, 

**Jan Love, PhD**

You can be a carrier without symptoms. Just like anti-vax people should vaccinate for the greater good of society, you shouldn't be traveling around with the potential to spread Coronavirus even more. Yes, mortality rate is really low especially for young healthy adults, so you probably don't need to worry about dying if you're in that category. But bringing it back to your community, or bringing it to another community, can indirectly cause a lot of problems for people around you.

Sure odds are you won't spread it, but trying to capitalize on this by taking (and encouraging others to take) cheap flights while specifically being warned against travel just because you think you'll be fine comes off very self-centered. It's actually very easy to just stay home for a few weeks and not intentionally choose to be part of the problem"

For months, health experts and the World Health Organization have strongly advised against border closings and targeted travel bans, like the one Trump just announced against Europe.

“Travel restrictions can cause more harm than good by hindering info-sharing, medical supply chains and harming economies,” the head of the World Health Organization said shortly before the Trump administration’s earlier decision to ban travel from China.

The reason travel bans aren’t a good idea, experts say, is they can complicate the global response to outbreak and can lead to negative effects in the long-term.

Travel bans often lead to negative economic consequences for the countries banned, making them less likely to disclose outbreaks in the future. China, for example, initially tamped down reports during the 2002 SARS outbreak and initially with this current coronavirus outbreak.

Such bans can cause people to simply keep their travel surreptitious, making it harder to do crucial contact tracing of the infected. It can also choke the supply chain for medical supplies, drugs and other essentials. Travel bans, experts also point out, can cause friction, hampering information sharing and international efforts — as has happened between the United States and China at a time when coordination and transparency has been crucial to fighting the virus.

“It’s entirely unwise. First of all, it violates WHO recommendations and treaties that U.S. has signed onto. But it doesn’t even do anything to impact the epidemic,” said Lawrence Gostin, global health law professor at Georgetown University. “Many of the countries in Europe besides Italy have just as many cases or less than the Unites States. The idea this would reduce transmission here is not based on evidence. The reality is germs don’t respect borders.”

2020-03-11,grumblingduke,bestof,34,https://www.reddit.com/r/bestof/comments/fh52ak/uthrowawaykingday_explains_the_basic_math_of/fk9dij0/,"The OP is predicting exponential growth; i.e. that the number of new infections each time period is proportional to the number of current infections.

What we saw from China early on (but after the first few days) was much slower, quadratic growth; where the number of new infections each time period was a fixed number more than the number the previous time period. Since then the rate has dropped, and China is now down to about 20,000 active cases (due to people recovering or dying).

Exponential models are the simplest way of predicting infections; but all sorts of factors get in the way to slow it down, including steps taken by Governments, and limits on available new infections (if you have a town of 10,000 people, eventually you run out of new people to infect).

If you have a look at [some of the country graphs for infection rates](https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/#countries) and so on, you can see that the total infections starts looking fairly exponential, but then slows down (China has nearly come to a stop). That is to be expected, and we should see the same thing in the US. It's a bit early to say, but we should start seeing the new infections drop in places like Italy, it has already dropped in South Korea.

The big questions are how reliable the current data is (places like the US and UK have been testing at a fairly low rate and in limited circumstances, so their numbers could be way off), and what measures Governments (and the general public) take to limit spread of the virus.

So the question isn't ""will the new infection rate drop off at some point"" but more ""when will it start to drop off?"" The more drastic measures taken by Governments, the sooner that will happen (the total number of infections may not be much lower in either case, but spreading infections out makes it far more likely the healthcare systems can cope).

As for why the infection rate seems much faster in the US than in China, it is worth noting that China likely had a single starting point. So they probably started with a single infected individual, who infected 2 or more people, who each infected 2 or more people and so on. In contrast, the US (and other countries) will have several starting points for out-breaks."

* Trump temporarily suspends travel from Europe to the US
The restrictions will not apply to the UK, he said. The travel restriction will start Friday, and last for 30 days amid virus outbreak.

* Trump also encouraged older Americans to avoid all travel if possible. He reviewed other measures his administration is taking to address the pandemic.

* In his brief address, the president continued to signal that the pandemic is mainly a threat outside American borders, without fully acknowledging that the coronavirus is spreading within the US.

By next week, I'm thinking markets could be very bleak and that means we could get to the point where even the real numbers won't spook markets.

Just some thoughts on the process of bottoming.  It's just important to try to be nimble around these things; markets typically bottom when bearish sentiment reaches its peak and that will happen well before the coronavirus actually peaks in the US."

On one hand we have all these people freaking out and asking someone to ""do something!"" Then people who call the shots make decisions like this and another factions complain that this is a ""sky is falling"" response.

The possible outcomes:

1. Coronavirus becomes a world history event where *everyone* knows people who died, after which the survivors will talk about the hardship of having march madness not allow the fans.

2. Coronavirus doesn't become that kind of historical event (bad enough, I know) because people made decisions along the lines of not allowing fans to attend games, banning travel, closing campuses, etc.

3. Coronavirus just turns out not to be a big deal [so why couldn't we let the fans go to march madness, maaaan!?]

I think 3 is unlikely, but to morons who complain that their lives are being disrupted, they'll never know the difference between 2 & 3 and insist that it was 3, because they're Alex Jones fans.

I wish the CDC would come out and say, ""Welcome to what the world felt like before vaccines. If you choose not to vaccinate your kids because you think your ignorance is just as good as our knowledge, then go fuck yourselves."""

Homeland Security Acting Secretary Chad F. Wolf’s Statement on Presidential Proclamation To Protect the Homeland from Travel-Related Coronavirus Spread

Release Date: March 11, 2020
(WASHINGTON) Today President Donald J. Trump signed a Presidential Proclamation, which suspends the entry of most foreign nationals who have been in certain European countries at any point during the 14 days prior to their scheduled arrival to the United States. These countries, known as the Schengen Area, include: Austria, Belgium, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Iceland, Italy, Latvia, Liechtenstein, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, and Switzerland. This does not apply to legal permanent residents, (generally) immediate family members of U.S. citizens, and other individuals who are identified in the proclamation.  

Statement from DHS Acting Secretary Chad F. Wolf:

“Protecting the American people from threats to their safety is the most important job of the President of the United States. The actions President Trump is taking to deny entry to foreign nationals who have been in affected areas will keep Americans safe and save American lives. I applaud the president for making this tough but necessary decision. While these new travel restrictions will be disruptive to some travelers, this decisive action is needed to protect the American public from further exposure to the potentially deadly coronavirus.

“In January and February, the Administration issued similar travel restrictions on individuals who had been in China and Iran. That action proved to be effective in slowing the spread of the virus to the U.S., while public health officials prepared. In the next 48 hours, in the interest of public health, I intend to issue a supplemental Notice of Arrivals Restriction requiring U.S. passengers that have been in the Schengen Area to travel through select airports where the U.S. Government has implemented enhanced screening procedures.”"

2020-03-11,-ZeuS--,Coronavirus,30,https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/fha6hj/cdc_takes_heat_on_capitol_hill_over_coronavirus/fk9vavk/,"Extract:

The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has long had a reputation as the global leader in managing disease outbreaks. That’s now in question.

As the novel coronavirus has spread in the U.S., with more than a thousand cases and at least 36 deaths, the CDC is under increasing heat to defend a shaky rollout of crucial testing kits.

Amid the growing criticism, Robert Redfield, the CDC’s top official, testified before lawmakers on Capitol Hill Wednesday to defend the agency’s performance. In a heated exchange, he called the CDC’s response to the virus “aggressive” and responded to reports of contaminated test kits.

“Recovering from that misstep cost us precious weeks and now months,” Representative Raja Krishnamoorthi, a Democrat from Illinois, responded to Redfield. “Meanwhile the virus spread and people died.”

In his testimony, Redfield “seemed to paint a rosy picture of the CDC. I think that really ran contrary to the facts,” Krishnamoorthi said in an interview.

The CDC has been called to task for its in-house coronavirus tests that initially delivered inconclusive results. Health experts also criticized the agency’s guidance that appeared to limit testing to only the highest-risk patients.

These blunders almost certainly set U.S. preparedness back weeks, delaying the identification of additional cases that might have slowed the spread of the disease.

The U.S. response is in stark contrast to other countries, such as South Korea, that successfully ramped up their own testing, thus getting a more accurate picture of the extent of infections.

“Sending out faulty tests is unforgivable,” said David Ho, a leading AIDS researcher based at Columbia University. “There was so much time to prepare.”

Tom Frieden, a onetime commissioner of the New York City Health Department and former CDC director, said in an interview that testing for other outbreaks like Zika and H1N1, which he oversaw, didn’t run into similar problems. The current testing situation is “certainly disappointing,” Frieden said.

Frieden is currently chief executive of Resolve to Save Lives, which is funded by Bloomberg Philanthropies, whose founder, Michael Bloomberg, is also founder and majority owner of Bloomberg LP.

Ebola, Zika

The CDC, founded in Atlanta in 1946, has its roots in a World War II-era effort to rid the southern states of malaria. Its purview broadened over the years, including to additional kinds of infectious diseases and, more recently, to other health threats including chronic disease.

The CDC sent more than a thousand staffers to West Africa at the height of the Ebola crisis, and successfully created and dispersed Zika tests in 2016. To be sure, the agency faced criticism then, too, for aspects of its response to those crises.

The advent of coronavirus has also put Redfield, as the CDC’s leader, squarely in conflict with President Donald Trump’s administration, which has sought to downplay the risks even as the CDC’s own experts warned that the disease would spread in the U.S.

Democratic politicians recently pressed Trump administration health officials about whether they will report the truth about coronavirus in the U.S., reflecting a distrust with the administration’s handling of the subject.

Officials, including Food and Drug Administration Commissioner Stephen Hahn and NIH National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases Director Anthony Fauci, all said they would do so even if it meant contradicting Trump.

Redfield was not in attendance then, but during testimony on the Hill this week, he appeared to blame bureaucratic red tape for testing delays, citing regulatory processes that had to be navigated for use in different types of patients.

Representative Rosa DeLauro of Connecticut asked Redfield if the testing delay led to more transmission of coronavirus and undermined the CDC’s traditional public-health efforts.

“I’m not willing to concede the second,” Redfield said. “I am willing to say that we had to go through a regulatory process here to get our test out, and our test was approved for very specific clinical settings.”"

2020-03-11,Netrovert87,funny,30,https://www.reddit.com/r/funny/comments/fh4ctm/same_honestly/fk96oix/,"This is exactly right. If you are young and healthy the coronavirus poses very little threat to you personally. However there is no vaccine yet, so the vulnerable population is wholly dependent on everyone doing their best to not catch this virus, since if you don't catch it, you can't spread it. Extrapolate that out to the broader population, a few percentage points less of the population that catches is illness can make a huge difference on how much this spreads over time.  


This is kind of a paradox for people. If we take major steps now and it turns out to be nothing, people will look back at this and say there was a whole lot of fuss over a whole lot of nothing. When in fact the whole point of reacting now is so that this doesn't become the 21st century version of the Spanish Flu.  


What makes me uneasy is I look at the extreme measures China went to get this thing under control (measures that I doubt the West can match for you know, liberty purposes) and it still infected at least 80,000. If we can't at least match that level of containment even a 1% mortality rate starts adding up fast."

You as a student now have the option to determine whether or not the risk of being on campus outweighs the risk of potentially catching coronavirus.

There are lots of people out there, especially those in dorms and in Bear Creek, that don't have homes to go back to where they can effectively get work done

At first it may look like CU is using this as a way to avoid losing money, and I agree that they definitely are to an extent, but at the same time it works out best for students. Especially for those that didn't believe there was much risk in the first place

Barron has shared the following message with the University community, announcing a move to remote instruction starting March 16 in response to the global coronavirus outbreak.

President Barron’s message to the University community:

Dear Penn State Community:  

As you know, communities around the globe are facing unprecedented challenges as coronavirus continues to spread. It remains our goal to take the necessary, active steps to confront this public health threat and manage our risks.

In light of this situation, and in the best interests of the health and safety of students, faculty, staff and our local communities, Penn State has decided to move to remote learning for all classes beginning Monday, March 16, through Friday, April 3, with a plan to resume in-person classes on Monday, April 6, at the earliest. For faculty and staff, the University will remain open, however there are additional details below regarding specifics.

* The continuity of class delivery is critical to the success of our students. All in-person classes, seminars and labs will be delivered remotely for students at every campus location. The College of Medicine will soon announce consistent protocols that reflect the unique mission of that unit and its relationship with the Milton S. Hershey Medical Center and Penn State Health. Penn College will also announce separate guidance for its community.
* During this three-week period following spring break, undergraduate and graduate students at all campus locations are strongly discouraged from returning to campus, off-campus locations, and group dwellings (e.g., apartments and fraternities), and should return to, or remain at, home during this time period.
* For international students who are already on campus, and students who must return to campus due to extenuating and/or compelling circumstances, we will work with you on an individual basis to make special visit or housing arrangements. Students should contact their campus Housing office, and contact information is available at: hfs.psu.edu/campuses.
* Please also be aware that residence halls and campus dining facilities will not be reopened for normal operation during this remote-learning period (beyond the facilities that are already in use). For students who need to retrieve belongings, arrangements for temporary access can be made. Students should contact their campus Housing office, and contact information is available at: hfs.psu.edu/campuses.
* For those students who do not have access to a computer and/or the internet from home or from alternate locations, we will assist you in getting access from computer labs at campus locations. Please contact the IT Director at your campus or the IT Service Desk (ITservicedesk@psu.edu) at University Park to determine computer lab availability or for more information about those arrangements and the available locations.
* All on-campus student-sponsored events and activities, such as student organization meetings, will be postponed/canceled until April 6, at the earliest. Please reach out to Student Affairs with further questions. This direction is applicable to all other locations, including gatherings at off-campus locations.
* All non-essential events should be canceled, rescheduled or offered virtually through April 6, regardless of the size of the event. No new non-essential events should be scheduled. For essential events that are expected to have more than 50 attendees, approval must be sought from Provost Nick Jones (provost@psu.edu).


While there are no known cases of coronavirus at University Park or Penn State’s campuses at this time, there are currently more than 1,000 cases throughout the United States, including in Pennsylvania, and we anticipate this figure will continue to grow. The best mechanism for prevention based on advice from experts is social distancing, and unfortunately that is very difficult in a university setting. We fully understand these changes will cause disruptions in your day-to-day lives; Penn State’s decision was made out of an abundance of caution and with your health and the well-being of our entire community in mind, and as Pennsylvania is currently under a state of emergency. Penn State has been following federal and state guidance, including from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the Pennsylvania Department of Health.

This action represents a significant interruption of normal business practice for our community, not only from a logistical standpoint, but also in the ways we embrace a sense of community, teach our classes, gather together, create new knowledge and share in our differences and similarities. However, we know that community infection is a primary mode of transmission and we need to do all we can to protect those around us, including those who may be more at risk or vulnerable to this virus. If there was ever a “We Are” moment, this is it. We need to come together in the full spirit of the phrase, support one another and stand up for what we believe: The importance of community.

We know that you will have specific questions and concerns about how this ongoing situation will impact learning, teaching, housing, and other factors in the coming weeks. I encourage you to bookmark and continue to visit psu.edu/virusinfo, for the latest updates and information, including an extensive FAQ. From this site you will be able to access critical information — specific for student needs online, and directions for faculty and staff.


**Guidance on remote learning for students and faculty:**


* If you’ve never taken an online course, visit remotelearning.psu.edu.
* To support students learning virtually, faculty and staff are encouraged to work with students to provide digital course materials for those who may not have access to their textbooks or course materials during this period.
* Graduate students should refer to graduate specific information on the Graduate School's website: gradschool.psu.edu/covid19.
* As communicated before spring break, there is information provided by Teaching and Learning with Technology and Undergraduate Education to help faculty move and teach classes remotely using online resources like Canvas. If you have specific questions, please contact your department head or division director.

**Information for faculty and staff:**


* Our employees across every campus are vital to the success of our institution and we will do everything we can to support them during this time.
* As appropriate, supervisors will work with their staff to accommodate telecommuting for staff members whose responsibilities can be accomplished outside of a University office and/or traditional work schedule. Employees should talk to their supervisor and unit HR to discuss their telecommuting options.
* Faculty and staff are expected to stay home if they feel sick. Faculty and employee supervisors are asked to be flexible when it comes to missed classes and work. For faculty and staff who are at a high risk for complications from contracting the coronavirus and/or have specific health concerns, please reach out to your immediate supervisors and/or your Human Resources Strategic Partner.


We will continue to strive to answer your questions and communicate regularly with the University community in the coming hours, days and weeks, including guidance related to large gatherings. Stay tuned for more information about a virtual town hall, which will provide time for students, faculty, staff, parents and others to ask questions and hear from University leaders about this situation.

While you may not be with us here on campus, we would continue to reiterate that all in our community follow CDC guidance regarding the best ways to prevent illness — avoiding contact with those who are sick and practicing personal hygiene and social distancing. You may see additional messages on our social media channels on these topics and we encourage you to share these with those around you to promote health and well-being.

Thank you for your support and for being flexible given the circumstance our world is facing, and for working together to minimize the potential spread of the coronavirus within our community.

Events are unfolding rapidly, so please continue to watch for communications from Penn State, as the plans outlined above could change. For the latest updates and information, visit psu.edu/virusinfo. Students, if your questions are not answered at remotelearning.psu.edu or psu.edu/virusinfo/faqs, please reach out to COVID19StudentSupport@psu.edu.

We need to train more people to test and screen for the virus effectively, have more access to screenings (this includes people in the city, without cars, people who live in the rural, etc.),  more available resources to the public, and have more information on the status of effective treatments and vaccinations.

Instead of placing blame on others, he should be looking more solutions to slow the spread and not boost the economy.  If you have an unhealthy population, you'll have a downfall in the economy.  So stop with the tax cuts and focus on a more public health solution to combat the COVID-19 spread!"

""""All football matches in England will be played behind closed doors under government plans to combat coronavirus that could be triggered as early as today.

A meeting of the government’s Cobra committee this morning is expected to move its response to the pandemic from the “contain” phase to the “delay” phase. That will result in a crisis plan being unveiled for football. The Times can reveal:

● The current season will not be postponed and instead matches in the Premier League and lower divisions will be moved behind closed doors;

● All Premier League season-ticket holders and ticket holders for individual games will be able to stream coverage of matches into their homes;

● No games will be shown in pubs so as to avoid congregation of people;

● Premier League games will not be shown live in the 3pm slot on Saturday afternoons;

● Broadcasters will be permitted to screen more than one Premier League game during both the lunchtime and tea-time television slots on Saturday, and the scheduled slots on Sundays and Mondays; and

● Season-ticket holders and ticket holders for individual games at Football League clubs will be allowed to watch matches on iFollow streams.

The plan may be implemented once the number of UK coronavirus cases passes 500. Last night it stood at 460.

The dramatic moves are seen as the only potential way to end the present season in light of the growing coronavirus crisis in England and the growing possibility of the country being moved to the delay phase.

The government has been in discussion with the Premier League, the Football League and the Football Association about what can be done. The uncertainty over how the virus will develop and how long it will last are seen as reasons why English football will not be temporarily postponed. The forthcoming Euros also present a problem to the Premier League as to when this season would actually finish and how it could impact upon future campaigns.

Fans set off flares last night as PSG played Dortmund behind closed doors Fans set off flares last night as PSG played Dortmund behind closed doors ANNE-CHRISTINE POUJOULAT/AFP VIA GETTY IMAGES Sporting integrity has been cited as a major factor in moving against the possibility of cancelling the season outright, although smaller clubs who are more reliant on gate receipts are worried about the financial implications of matches without ticket sales.

However, there are huge penalty clauses in the Premier League broadcasting contracts if the season was terminated rather than played to a conclusion. These would run into hundreds of millions of pounds for the Premier League and would most likely have to be passed onto the clubs, or alternatively would be clawed back by removing things such as parachute payments.

That is what has led to the solution of moving games behind closed doors.

The Premier League has been the last major organisation in Europe to move towards ending spectator attendance at their games.

So far the government has followed medical advice that has insisted the congregation of large crowds at outdoor events is not dangerous. However, it is the close proximity of supporters travelling, especially on trains, that is now seen as the biggest threat.

Under the plans, pubs will be ordered not to show live coverage of matches and will be threatened with the loss of their licence if they fail to comply. It is thought this will be policed strongly because of the risk to health.

The present proposals are to broadcast every single Premier League game. Every season-ticket holder, or anyone who has a bought a ticket for a game would get a free stream. Clubs would then be able to sell streams for their games to fans as well. Even given the extraordinary nature of the times, there is still a desire not to set a precedent by showing games live at 3pm on a Saturday, traditionally a protected slot to incentivise fans going to watch their local teams in person.

The Premier League has been in negotiations with the Football League to assure them that none of their games would be shown live at 3pm on a Saturday. Broadcasters would face less pressure in the unique environment to put matches directly up against other games. The solution would involve existing slots with potentially three games shown at the same time.

The decision by the Premier League to move all of their games away from the 3pm Saturday slot would allow the Football League to stream all of their matches at that time using the iFollow technology.

Most Football League clubs already have that technology installed to allow them to stream their games. Some clubs have their own streams but the technology is in place for every club to stream their games live.

Ticket-holders will have to settle for watching their teams on free TV streams Ticket-holders will have to settle for watching their teams on free TV streams JAMES MARSH/REX There is still concern, however, at Football League level, about the loss of matchday income which in some cases at that level constitutes two thirds of their annual income. Talks have taken place at government level about whether there is compensation available. The chancellor Rishi Sunak unveiled a £30 billion package to help the country get through the coronavirus in his budget yesterday but it is unknown if any of that will be put aside for struggling football clubs fearful of going bust.

Playing games behind closed doors is now seen as the least bad option. It means that existing fixture schedules can be completed across all of the four main leagues in England. Most English clubs have at least nine league matches to play, plus the remaining rounds of the FA Cup and Champions League.

As it stands only players, team officials, broadcasters and journalists would be allowed to attend games in England. A further complication however would be if infection was to spread between players. At that point it is thought that the Professional Footballers’ Association would say that the danger to their members would be too great and games would be cancelled.

At present the Bundesliga in Germany and Ligue One in France have already gone behind closed doors, and one Division Two footballer in Germany has tested positive for the virus.

The Manchester City manager Pep Guardiola has voiced his concern about playing games without supporters in attendance. “Does football work without spectators?” he said. “If the people can’t come, there is no sense. We will follow what we have to do, but I wouldn’t like to do it without the people.

“The other issue you have to ask is: is it worse to play football without the spectators? We do our job for the people and if the people cannot come to watch us, there is no sense.

“I would not love to play matches in the Premier League or Champions League or the cups without the people, but we will follow the instructions of the government.”

Discussions have shown that all eventualities are fraught with difficulties, but it is seen as the only way ahead."""

* Over 76% of those infected with the virus in China have recovered (over 61000 people). This data can be found [here](https://covid19info.live/). China's measures have been drastic, but this is evidence that the disease can be delayed and better controlled if the right actions are taken.

* The number of new cases in South Korea [continues to fall](https://www.cdc.go.kr/html/a3/namoimage/images/000004/20200310202654209_T67AH9EN.png)—the country reported 131 new cases on 10/03, which was down from 248 the day before and 367 the day before that. They are not out of the woods yet and we'll likely to continue to see more cases every day, but the fact that the daily rate is trending downwards is good news.
* Codogno, which was one of the first clusters in Italy to be reported, [has reported no new cases for the first time](https://www.ansa.it/sito/notizie/topnews/2020/03/10/zero-contagi-a-codogno-e-prima-volta_74babe60-e4a7-4e07-b8ca-94016f24b5b4.html).

**Statsministeren:**

* 514 danskere er nu smittet med coronavirus. Det fortæller statsministeren. 

- Hvad jeg kommer til at fortælle i aften kommer til at have en stor betydning for rigtigt mange danskere, siger statsminister Mette Frederiksen (S).

- Det går rigtigt hurtigt herhjemme. Også for hurtigt. Og derfor intensiverer myndigheder nu sit arbejde, lyder det. 

- Vi er nu nået til næste stadie. Og det betyder, at vi skal tage stærkere midler i brug for at undgå smitte. Og derfor betyder det, at alles adfærd kommer til at få betydning.

- Den sundhedsfaglige analyse er, at vi ikke skal omgås hinanden for meget. Vi skal stå sammen, og vi skal hjælpe hinanden. Men vi skal gøre det på en anden måde, end vi har gjort før. Nu skal vi holde afstand til hinanden.

- Det er vores klare overbevisning, at vi hellere skal handle i dag end at fortryde i morgen. Derfor skal vi sætte ind, hvor mange mennesker er samlet.

- Og derfor er det myndighedernes anbefaling, at vi nedlægger et forbud på en række punkter.

* Alle offentlige uddannelsesinstitutioner og daginstitutioner lukker foreløbigt for at mindske spredning af coronavirus, siger statsminister Mette Frederiksen (S). I foreløbigt to uger. 

* Også offentligt ansatte skal ikke på arbejde, lyder det fra statsministeren. 

* Alle offentligt ansatte der ikke varetager kritiske situationer sendes hjem foreløbigt to uger frem

* Også alle private arbejdsgivere opfordres til at kunne arbejde hjemmefra, siger statsministeren.

- Vi skal minimere aktiviteten i samfundet mest muligt. Men uden at sætte Danmark i stå. 

- Alle skoler og dagtilbud lukkes fra mandag og to uger frem. 

-  Sygehuse og plejehjem opfordres til at begrænse besøg med øjeblikkelig virkning

- Opfordringen lyder nu, at man ikke samler mere end 100 mennesker indendørs. Og alle natklubber og diskoteker opfordres til at holde lukket i en periode, siger statsministeren. 

- Et egentlig lovforslag på området forventes stemt igennem i næste uge, siger statsministen.

- ""Alt det her tilsammen kommer til at få kæmpestore konsekvenser. Men alternativet vil være langt, langt  værre. Og det håber jeg, at der er stor forståelse for.""

- Normalt vil en regering ikke fremlægge disse ting uden, at der er løsninger på det. Men vi står i en ekstraordinær situation, siger Mette Frederiksen. 

- Vi kommer ikke igennem det her som land, uden at vi har omkostninger. Virksomheder vil lide tab og folk vil miste deres job. Regeringen vil gøre, hvad de kan for at hjælpe. Og vi er i tæt kontakt med arbejdsmarkedets parter for at gøre dette bedst, siger Mette Frederiksen. 

- ""Alle, der er raske, og ikke føler sig udsatte, vi har et kæmpe ansvar overfor de udsatte."" 

- Statsministeren opfordrer til, at man hjælper sine bekendte og familie. Vi skal udvise ""et stort samfundssind"", lyder det.

* Statsministeren fortæller, at hun har været i kontakt med alle partiledere, og at der er stort opbakning til alle de nye iniativer.

* Samtidig siger hun, at hun selv og alle ministre ikke vil deltage i en række arrangementer.

- Jeg har talt om en række små ting. Men det, som jeg har bedt om, det er store ting for danskerne. Vi skal tænke på andre. Særligt dem, der er udsatte. Jeg vil allerede nu takke alle dem i sundhedsvæsnet, der har gjort en kæmpe indsats, siger Mette Frederiksen (S).

**Sundhedsstyrelsen:**

- Det er ikke kun en trussel mod Danmark. Det er en trussel mod hele verden. Det er også derfor, at WHO i dag har erklæret det til at være en pandemi. Det sker ikke ret tid, og derfor skal vi ikke tage let på det.

- Vi har set en meget hurtig smitte i Danmark. Og vi ser nu også en smittespredning i Danmark. Samtidig ser vi også nu svært syge, der kræver behandling. 

- Derfor ændrer vi nu også strategi. Tidligere har vi kørt en inddæmningsstrategi. Den er rigtig, så længe vi kan lokalisere smitten. Men i en situation, hvor vi ser en udvikling, så giver det ikke længere mening. Derfor skal vi skifte vores strategi, så vi fokuserer på dem, der har allermest behov, siger direktør i Sundhedsstyrelsen, Søren Brostrøm.

- Så fra i morgen laver vi en ny strategi. Fremover bliver der spurgt, hvor syg man er. Og så vil det være over telefon, man bliver visiteret, så de rigtige kan findes og isoleres.

- Sundhedsstyrelsen skifter altså over til en såkaldt afbødningsstrategi. Alle sygehuse i Danmark bliver samtidig gjort klar til at modtage svært syge, lyder det.

**Rigspolitichef:**

- Vi ved godt i politiet, at der nogle, der ikke frygter den. Men det er der nogle der gør. Derfor skal vi vise ansvarlighed. Og derfor skal vi ikke samles. Det kan virke paradoksalt, men det er vigtigt.

- Nu strammer vi og opfordrer kraftigt til, at man ikke samles mere end 100 mennesker. Det er vigtigt det her. Det handler om samfundet og ikke dig selv, siger rigspolitichef, Thorkild Fogde. 

- Rigspolitichefen er sikker på, at det vil lykkes, men at det  vil betyde 'ofre' for os allesammen."

The government can only do so much, people need to start taking this seriously and taking precautions and preventative measures in their own lives while there is time.

There is a lot of conflicting and mis-information out there, people would do well to take some time and read the wikipedia article on the [Coronavirus pandemic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019%E2%80%9320_Wuhan_coronavirus_outbreak) and also check out r/coronavirus for the latest.  Become more familiar with the [symptoms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Symptoms_of_coronavirus_disease_2019_2.0.svg).

I don't want to sound chicken little-ish but this can become very real; it's not the black death, but it's not just the flu either.  Meme-ing, joking and shade-throwing is well and good while it is well and good - it increasingly rings like gallows humor - but people need to face *and prepare for as best they can* some very real and painful possibilities - social, family, emotional, political, economical.  I'm just an ordinary guy, but my sense is that things are gonna get pretty weird for a while.

Take care of yourself, take care of others such as it is in your power.  Fear and ignorance are the more dangerous contagion.  If your only contribution is cynicism consider saving it for a different topic.  Patience and compassion though not often stockpiled should be in unlimited supply.  Good luck everybody."

If Snell gets it, he'll likely have a shitty week and bounce back just fine.  However, it's absolutely not over-hyped in regards to public health.

1. Unlike the flue, there's no vaccine.  The flu doesn't spread much thanks to herd immunity.  With coronavirus, everyone is a potential carrier. That makes it much more contagious than the flu.
2. With the coronavirus, the incubation period is over 5 days. That means you could have it and be spreading it 5 days before you even even feel off. You can't be reactive and just lock yourself away once symptoms show because it's already too late, you have to be proactive. Snell could catch the virus on a road trip, unknowingly spread it, and be on his third city when the symptoms hit.
3. It's contagiousness combined with our lack of defenses means potentially massive numbers of people could come down with it, putting a huge strain on our healthcare systems. Whether directly or indirectly, that will cost lives.
4. The fatality rate in elderly people is devastatingly high. Those 70-79 have an 8% fatality rate and for those 80+, it rockets up to 14.8%.

For a guy like Snell and most of us posting, it's a shitty inconvenience.  But with it's high death rate for those over 70, being so far from a vaccine, and its apparent contagiousness, it needs to be treated seriously.  We all have family, friends, colleagues, etc. for whom this virus poses a very real threat."

I was in California about 2ish weeks ago and started getting sick about 5-6 days after I came back with what I thought was a regular cold. That cold turned into full blown sick the other day so I hauled myself into the doctor's office this morning. I tested negative for the flu so my doctor (bless them) went ahead and swabbed me for coronavirus. So needless to say, I'm quarantined at home until I find out for sure. And I should add -- I've been super careful about my hygiene well before I ever went out to California, I was actively trying to avoid catching it.


Low key I'm terrified. Not because of how the virus will affect me personally but of the stigma surrounding it and the possibility that I might have exposed a ton of my colleagues to it without even knowing.

Well, now.  What to do next?  The Medical Officials have protocols that must be followed. We Hanks’ will be tested, observed, and isolated for as long as public health and safety requires.  Not much more to it than a one-day-at-a-time approach, no?

Coronavirus in Italy tweet on March 9

[https://twitter.com/silviast9/status/1236933818654896129](https://twitter.com/silviast9/status/1236933818654896129) 

1/ I may be repeating myself, but I want to fight this sense of security that I see outside of the epicenters, as if nothing was going to happen ""here"". The media in Europe are reassuring, politicians are reassuring, while there's little to be reassured of.  

2/ This is the English translation of a post of another ICU physician in Bergamo, Dr. Daniele Macchini. Read until the end ""After much thought about whether and what to write about what is happening to us, I felt that silence was not responsible.

3/ I will therefore try to convey to people far from our reality what we are living in Bergamo in these days of Covid-19 pandemic. I understand the need not to create panic, but when the message of the dangerousness of what is happening does not reach people I shudder.  

4/ I myself watched with some amazement the reorganization of the entire hospital in the past week, when our current enemy was still in the shadows: the wards slowly ""emptied"", elective activities were interrupted, intensive care were freed up to create as many beds as possible.

5/ All this rapid transformation brought an atmosphere of silence and surreal emptiness to the corridors of the hospital that we did not yet understand, waiting for a war that was yet to begin and that many (including me) were not so sure would ever come with such ferocity.  

6/ I still remember my night call a week ago when I was waiting for the results of a swab. When I think about it, my anxiety over one possible case seems almost ridiculous and unjustified, now that I've seen what's happening. Well, the situation now is dramatic to say the least.  

7/ The war has literally exploded and battles are uninterrupted day and night. But now that need for beds has arrived in all its drama. One after the other the departments that had been emptied fill up at an impressive pace.  

8/ The boards with the names of the patients, of different colours depending on the operating unit, are now all red and instead of surgery you see the diagnosis, which is always the damned same: bilateral interstitial pneumonia.  

9/ Now, explain to me which flu virus causes such a rapid drama.  And while there are still people who boast of not being afraid by ignoring directions, protesting because their normal routine is""temporarily"" put in crisis,  

10/ the epidemiological disaster is taking place. And there are no more surgeons, urologists, orthopedists, we are only doctors who suddenly become part of a single team to face this tsunami that has overwhelmed us.  

11/ Cases are multiplying, we arrive at a rate of 15-20 admissions per day all for the same reason. The results of the swabs now come one after the other: positive, positive, positive. Suddenly the E.R. is collapsing. 

12/ Reasons for the access always the same: fever and breathing difficulties, fever and cough, respiratory failure. Radiology reports always the same: bilateral interstitial pneumonia, bilateral interstitial pneumonia, bilateral interstitial pneumonia. All to be hospitalized.  

13/ Someone already to be intubated and go to intensive care. For others it's too late... Every ventilator becomes like gold: those in operating theatres that have now suspended their non-urgent activity become intensive care places that did not exist before.  

14/ The staff is exhausted. I saw the tiredness on faces that didn't know what it was despite the already exhausting workloads they had. I saw a solidarity of all of us, who never failed to go to our internist colleagues to ask ""what can I do for you now?""  

15/ Doctors who move beds and transfer patients, who administer therapies instead of nurses. Nurses with tears in their eyes because we can't save everyone, and the vital parameters of several patients at the same time reveal an already marked destiny.  

16/ There are no more shifts, no more hours. Social life is suspended for us. We no longer see our families for fear of infecting them. Some of us have already become infected despite the protocols.

17/ Some of our colleagues who are infected also have infected relatives and some of their relatives are already struggling between life and death. So be patient, you can't go to the theatre, museums or the gym. Try to have pity on the myriad of old people you could exterminate.  

18/ We just try to make ourselves useful. You should do the same: we influence the life and death of a few dozen people. You with yours, many more. Please share this message. We must spread the word to prevent what is happening here from happening all over Italy.""  

20/ I finish by saying that I really don't understand this war on panic. The only reason I see is mask shortages, but there's no mask on sale anymore. We don't have a lot of studies, but is it panic really worse than neglect and carelessness during an epidemic of this sort?"

The health and safety of you and your family is our most important priority. It is for this reason that given the developing Coronavirus news, we believe it is no longer appropriate for Beachbody to hold this event in an environment when the global priority is to contain and avoid further spread of the Coronavirus.

With the prospect of transmission and health implications and other consequences that could extend beyond the trip itself, it is has become clear that to hold the event, we could actually exacerbate the problem. It is our obligation (particularly as a company with our mission statement) to take these matters seriously and act appropriately.

It is with all that in mind that we have decided to cancel the Punta Cana Success Club trip and refund everyone (including those who canceled previously, including before the coronavirus escalation.)

The process and timing by which refunds will be issued will be detailed in a separate communication via direct email to everyone impacted. I respectfully ask that you refrain from contacting our Events team, Compliance or Customer Service regarding this trip until our next communication that will contain more specific details. We need to get more information before we can give answers.

However, I wanted to communicate this decision as soon as we made it, even while we are still working through the logistical implications of the decision. We hope to have an update in the next 24 hours to provide further details, including whether there is the possibility that, even though there is no longer a Beachbody event with Beachbody presence, Super Trainers, or organized activities, coaches who still want to go to the resort could have the opportunity to do so on their own. We are not sure if this an option yet, but are discussing with the resort.

We know that so many of our Coaches worked hard to attend this trip. It’s incredibly disappointing to all of us, but these are extenuating, unprecedented circumstances.

In the meantime, please accept my personal apology if this decision (or the timing of our decision) caused you any anxiety or inconvenience which we could have avoided. This is a first for me, and as always, I’m trying to do the right thing for coaches while staying true to our mission of helping people lead healthy fulfilling lives.

I appreciate you more than you could possibly know. More details to follow.

TLDR SPY 200P 4/6 and SPY100P 5/15 We will be lucky to not go below SPY 100 by June. I hope I am wrong. The math says we're fucked.   


1. Nothing is stopping the rona short term. That shit will hurt all business period. No news story, or magic cure or anything is going to stop people from getting sick and dying in large numbers over the next 14 days. Sorry Boomers. Please don't die Mom...   

2. The above is going to overwhelm our medical system which is already mostly broken. Hospitals are operating with historic low levels of open beds, TODAY. 20% of COVID-19 cases can require hospitalization. We don't have any extra beds for these people. This will cause panic because when the hospitals are full and anyone gets sick for anything they are screwed. See italy today...   
Up to 150 million Americans are expected to contract the coronavirus, congressional doctor says. Roughly 20% of cases require hospital beds that is.... 30 million hospital beds we don't have. We might have like 1.5 million...   

3. Next on the bad news team is that 4% of folks die. So out of 100 million Americans, 4 million die. 6 million if 150mil get it. 6 million Americans is 2% of the population. That is more than the percentage of Americans killed in all of WW2. That is up there with WORLDWIDE casualties from WW2 (3% of the global population). This bullet point right here is why PRC went full roman soldier on WUHAN with beatings for leaving your house. Their percentage if the contagion spread out of control would be legion. Ask Italy and Iran how this is going...  

4.  So we have a huge portion of the elderly needing hospital beds they don't have. No one can get sick or injured and expect treatment because every hospital in the nation is going to look like a MASH unit from the Korean war. AND no one wants to get this shit, so people STOP GOING OUT. That's right. Think anyone is buying cars/doughnuts/houses, or fuck all in Italy right now? Nope. 30 days minimum no major purchases spending or much more besides Netflix and chill alone eating frozen waffles. OH and planes travel stops and the borders might close. Sounds like things that might hurt the bottom line....  

5. Our entire leadership team is the prime target for this virus. So what happens when they get it...   

6. I could go on down the path of what will happen when we go full tilt on this. 43 million Americans don't have health insurance. 78% of Americans live paycheck to paycheck. I hope they can afford a month of no work... The downward pressure on 330 million people will be immense NO ONE is going to profit here.  

7. You can't leadership or money this problem away anymore. A general Quarantine like North Korea might have worked back in early FEB like the PRC did, but honestly,as I can't see Americans taking this shit seriously even as I type this. The YOLO answer is almost better because the national nightmare will be over quicker but with many more dead.  

8. If you read this far get ready for the nightmare shit.  

9. The Banks CAN NOT HANDLE THIS. SO much of the banking empire is built on growth, month after month of no growth is going to destroy dozens of industries filled with high debt corporations. The oil sector is the canary in the coal mine. What happens when the retail sector curls up and dies. or the hospitality sector.

I went to the ER with fever (101.9F at admission), cough and extreme shortness of breath. I legit thought I was dying, I couldn’t get a full breath and it felt like there was pressure on my chest. The fluid in my lungs made me feel like I was drowning sometimes. It was overall a bad time. I was chastised for not coming in sooner but my wife’s cancer has completely wiped our savings, and I had hoped it was just a cold. At the time, I didn’t know what the symptoms of coronavirus were. I was admitted for atypical pneumonia of unknown origin, with lots of notes on my file about how it was very much atypical. 

Around this same time, one of the first patients in Florida to test positive for coronavirus was admitted to the same hospital with atypical pneumonia of unknown origin. We were on the same floor. Neither of us were in isolation. I was given mucinex and antibiotics and told to take tylenol for my fever and sent home, because before I was a healthy 30 yo with no issues. The other guy was in his 60s with underlying health issues. He tested positive for coronavirus the next day. 

Whenever I get snappy at the hospital about the possibility that they exposed me and everyone else on that floor to coronavirus, they claim that I probably already had it when I came in. I still have not been tested because I am not actively dying yet, though my symptoms have started to get worse. 

Which brings me to your incubation question: I can’t give an accurate answer because I don’t know if I had it before I went to the hospital or if my pneumonia made me more susceptible to it while I was there. My symptoms have worsened about six days after the approximate time of exposure at the hospital, which leads me to believe that that’s when I became infected."

1) This is an all hands on deck situation and we need students stepping up as interns (not unprecedented, happened in the world wars and happening in some European countries now). In this case, we'd want students to have proper PPE and legitimate useful roles in the care of these patients. 

2) We prioritize safety of students above all else. We send students home as non-essential personnel, and believe their learning is best facilitated by not being in hospitals during a pandemic.

Then people in the group go downstairs to the main gate and pick up their order.

2. Government will sometimes ship free or discounted goods and the local neighbourhood committee (a grass root CCP organ) organises a delivery. They will pile it up in a place and you go down and pick up a bagful. One at a time.

Scenario A: You think that the Coronavirus will cause a gigantic economic blip/market correction, and governments will step in with gigantic stimulus packages (pushing towards hyperinflation). Best option here would be to pull your money out into cash, wait for things to tank 40, 50, 60% or whatever, then buy 'safe haven assets', stock in old, gigantic stable companies, gold, silver, commodities, Bitcoin etc. 


Scenario B: You think we'll have a giant market correction, but governments will step back and allow this market correction to play out naturally in a 'free markets' style. Then the playbook is still pulling your money out into cash but *holding* said cash as countries experience stagflation a'la Japan in the past twenty years. Everything (food, housing, health insurance, cars) get 2-4% cheaper year over year, the stock market flatlines and anyone that pulled out into cash (I think Warren Buffett took this approach last year?) wins. 


Scenario C: You think the Coronavirus fears are unfounded, the media is overhyping things and this will blow over in a few months just like bird flu, swine flu, SARS, MERS, Zika etc. You can just ride this out. Continue to purchase stocks, bonds, crypto at regular intervals because this minor blip will recover in six months anyway, and we'll be back to business as usual.

* For starters, state health officials confirmed the [first positive case of the novel coronavirus in Miami-Dade County](https://www.miamiherald.com/news/health-care/article241116156.html), a 56-year-old man who traveled recently. That case — plus one new case in St Johns County and another in Broward — brings the total number of known cases among Florida residents who are currently in the state to 25.
* Right as we learned about the confirmation from state officials, Miami-Dade Mayor Carlos Gimenez signed a [state of emergency declaration for the county](https://www.miamiherald.com/news/health-care/article241116156.html), just a few days after Gov. Ron DeSantis did a statewide declaration for Florida on Monday.
* Also: State officials are struggling to stay on the same page with local officials on providing information about the virus. Bay Harbor Islands, a town just north of Miami Beach in Miami-Dade, told town staff that an employee was a ""presumptive positive"" case. It turns out, [the person hasn't gotten any test results](https://www.miamiherald.com/news/health-care/article241097436.html). And their travel companion tested negative, not positive as they'd thought. State officials aren't happy, especially since town officials declared a state of emergency even when a positive test had yet to be confirmed.

It looks like that's all (?) for tonight here in South Florida.

Trump’s Coronavirus Policies Don't Tackle the Pandemic

The US president promised loans and tax holidays, but his crisis-adjacent plans didn’t offer much to support the health care system.

In a speech from the Oval Office at the White House Wednesday night, President Donald Trump laid out new, aggressive policies designed, he said, to combat the further spread of the disease Covid-19—which, earlier Wednesday, the World Health Organization officially designated a pandemic. Among those new policies: a ban on travel from Europe (but not the United Kingdom), effective Friday, and low-interest loans to small businesses adversely affected by the disease. The president also said he’d ask congress for more money, $50 billion, to fund those loans, and that he’d push back the April deadline for federal taxes. “Because of the economic policies we have put into place over the last three years, we have the greatest economy anywhere in the world by far,” President Trump said. “This is not a financial crisis. This is just a temporary moment of time that we will overcome together as a nation and a world.”

These are major policies to undertake during a crisis. That makes sense; it’s a major crisis. At least 126,000 people around the world have contracted the disease, and more than 4,600 are dead—38 in the United States. But the policies don’t exactly address the pandemic—at least not in the way public health experts and scientists have been hoping the government would. These policies are more crisis-adjacent. As the disease-response expert Jeremy Kondynyk said on Twitter immediately after the speech, “economic measures are necessary, but they’re treating the symptoms.”

Research suggests that China’s ban on letting people leave Wuhan, the city where the virus emerged, came too late to slow down the progress of the virus within China, but slowed transmission by up to 80 percent elsewhere. Asian countries that banned immigration from China earlier this year did seem to slow the progress of the disease, but they were also testing people for infection internally and building out their public health systems. People looking back at other outbreaks, though—like SARS and MERS, or Ebola—tend to find that travel bans don’t work at all. They especially don’t work after community spread of the virus has begun—which it has, between people already in the United States. The barn door’s open, the horses are in the field somewhere. Also, travel is still OK from the United Kingdom, which not only has sustained Covid-19 infections (including the Health Minister) but is likely to announce that it is moving from a containment phase to “delay,” which means social distancing and self-isolation of sick people. Their horses have left their barn, too.

At first, it seemed like banning travel from Europe meant more than just people. “There will be exemptions for Americans who have undergone appropriate screenings,” President Trump said. But, he added, “anything coming from Europe to the United States is what we are discussing.” When the president spoke, he seemed to include cargo in the ban, which could have caused even bigger problems. The kits for testing whether someone is infected with Covid-19 have been in drastic short supply, and only a few thousand Americans have gotten tested so far (by contrast, something like 10,000 South Koreans get tested every day). The supplies for manufacturing those kits, “primers” made from the genetic material RNA, are running low, and at least some of those come from European pharmaceutical companies. But the Department of Homeland Security quickly issued what must be considered a clarification—just people, not US citizens, not stuff. A White House statement confirmed it didn’t cover cargo, too.

(Eh, whaddaya gonna do? The president also said “Earlier this week, I met with the leaders of health insurance industry who have agreed to waive all copayments for coronavirus treatments,” but spokespeople from that industry quickly, well, clarified that they were going to cover copayments for testing, not treatment. And none of that helps the uninsured. One of the key components of handling a disease outbreak is clear, cogent, honest communication from leaders, it seems important to add here.)

What was in the new policies was perhaps less striking than what was not: The president made no mention of help in manufacturing or purchasing personal protective equipment for health care workers. He didn’t mention building surge capacity for hospitals facing the possibility of huge numbers of people needing care—what’s happening in Italy right now. He only hinted at some sort of paid sick leave for people who are quarantined (a bill that would have gotten that set up got blocked in the US Senate Wednesday by the Republican chair of the responsible committee, Lamar Alexander), or help for people whose jobs don’t allow them to stop working or work from home as social distancing mitigation measures require.

These are the kinds of things that let a country flatten the curve—slow down the spread of illness, reduce pressure on hospitals, buy time for new therapies. But you have to make it financially possible for everyone to participate. As Scott Burris, director of the Center for Public Health Law Research at Temple Law School, told me a couple weeks ago, “equity and effectiveness go closely together in these situations.” The president instead merely urged people to wash their hands, cover their sneezes and coughs, and stay home if they’re sick. Necessary, but not exactly sufficient.

“I will always put the wellbeing of America first. If we are vigilant and we can reduce the chance of infection, which we will, we will significantly impede the transmission of the virus,” President Trump said. “The virus will not have a chance against us. No nation is more prepared or more resilient than the United States.” It’s a good sentiment, but so far federal policy hasn’t borne it out. The federal government is finally directing its massive, ponderous machinery at the new coronavirus, but most of that machinery’s going in the wrong direction."

I'm a teacher in a large district in the Bay Area, CA and there is no sign that they are working toward a shut-down yet.  They are telling us to report as normal and stay home when we are sick.  The supe even sent around links to articles [like this one](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/10/opinion/coronavirus-school-closing.html) from the New York Times as evidence that we shouldn't close down.  In my opinion, that article talks a lot about how the symptoms don't appear severe in children, but has very little talk of the fact that kids are still vectors and that teachers and classified staff may still be very susceptible to the illness.

I'm worried that I will soon have to make a choice to use sick days before I'm actually sick.  I also can't help but feel that the labor of teachers is being exploited while decisions are being made from an admin in a solo office that doesn't actually come into contact with 200-300 germy kids each day.

Thoughts?  My doctor friend suggested setting up a mandatory hand-washing station for each kid as they come through the door.  She also suggested that every kid be sent home for immediate isolation at the first cough, ache, or sign of illness.  As much as I trust her advice, clearly there is a large gap between what actually happens in a classroom and what people think you can control.  :)"

Most of the more recent outbreaks weren't nearly as widespread, mostly because those viruses burned through their victims so fast there wasn't time for them to get that far - especially those cases that involved ebola/marburg. 

SARS is a condition caused by the coronavirus group of infectious agents. So this latest pandemic is a distant cousin to those earlier outbreaks - but those spikes leveled out pretty quickly. 

This time around...shit is poised to get really real. The infection spike is practically like looking at the point of a knife. It's rapidly turning vertical the more testing that gets done. One of the reasons people are freaking out is that since, in the US, especially, pathetically few tests have actually been run. That means the number of infections out there in the wild that have been untested could be staggeringly higher than the numbers being reported.

""Italy confirms almost 200 deaths in 24 hours
Almost 200 people died from the coronavirus in 24 hours, Italy's Civil Protection Agency confirmed Wednesday — the highest daily increase in absolute terms registered anywhere in the world since the respiratory illness emerged in China at the end of last year.

In response, the country's prime minister, Giuseppe Conte, told reporters the government would allocate 25 billion euros ($28.3 billion) to help mitigate the impact on the fragile economy. Only a week ago, he estimated it would need just 7.5 billion. 

From Tuesday to Wednesday, 196 people died, bringing the total number of deaths to 897, the Civil Protection Agency said in a statement. Confirmed cases across the country rose to 12,462 from a previous 10,149.   

After an initial lockdown in the north failed to prevent the spread, the government on Monday banned all nonessential travel and public gatherings throughout Italy until April 3, halted all sports events and extended a shutdown of schools."""

People are still freaking out about how Trump is gonna win again, but he’s not. Trump won due to an extraordinary sequence of events in his favor that will not be replicated again, any one of which if changed would have changed the outcome. Most importantly, his opponent this time will not be the (however unfairly) hated Hillary Clinton, but rather someone already proven to be much more palatable to swing groups — who are voting in record numbers and have shown no signs they have turned back towards Trump since 2018. Indeed all signs point to a continued D trend among suburban types, and a Democratic surge in turnout due to anti-Trump fervor.

He’s gonna lose. He’s gonna lose Michigan, just like Bernie did and just like I predicted (literally I got almost the exact margin right when the initial numbers came in). There won’t be another million-to-one upset like that this year. And he’ll lose the whole thing along with it. He would most likely have anyway due to demographic trends and turnout alone, but this coronavirus disaster and likely subsequent recession will completely bury him.

There is no other mammal on Earth like the pangolin. They walk around at night, scooping up ants and termites with their long sticky tongues, meeting up with their kind only to mate. Their only defence from predators is their scales, which form protective armour when the pangolin wraps itself up in a tight ball.

There is no president in the last probably 100 years who's campaign rhetoric was a better match for what we needed to do in response to Coronavirus.

In this situation, isolationism is the right policy choice.  North America is one of the few places in the world that can actually pull off and prosper under isolationism, it is strategically self-sufficient.  This would have made the perfect chance to get some distance from an increasingly brittle, over-leveraged global financial system. Strengthen borders and focus on internal development.  It would have presented a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to pass a stimulus to rebuild America's manufacturing base in order to deal with the supply chain problems we will see.  I've never seen anything more tailor-made for what Trump constantly talks about.

Credit where credit is due, he made the call to limit travel from China early, but it has been nothing but really bad calls since then, and completely non-adaptive to the reality as it developed.

The overall trend is down; we are in a bearish market (even if not technically a bear market yet until S&P hits 2710).

In a bear market, you get extreme 3+% up/down moves regularly, sometimes multiple moves of that magnitude a day as we've seen the past couple of weeks.  Be a nimble trader around these moves, and stay in cash if you don't like any day's move.  Take profit quickly on short-term trades because they can reverse quickly.

Finding the bottom in a bear market is a process; it requires information about the cause of the economic slowdown, which in this case requires more testing data from the CDC/local governments and information about whether the Italy/European shutdowns work to halt the extent of the spread of the coronavirus.

I still think we're 2-3 weeks away from the bottom.  The bottom will occur when markets buy even on bad news related to the coronavirus.  That can admittedly start happening at any time.  It will happen if governments start doing enough to reverse the damage that the coronavirus is causing.  But it also won't happen until we see the real extent of the US spread and whether it's containable in Europe.  This is still 2-3 weeks away in all likelihood.

Once the US reaches max acceleration in case growth, that's really where I expect to see a bottom.  But again, nobody knows when that is."

A lot of learning management systems are getting apps nowadays. This means that kids can do more than just study, they can view course lesson content, take quizzes, do assignments, etc all from the comfort of their toilet or bed. It is a parent’s responsibility to educate themselves on the digital learning environments that are available to their kids, so just because it’s not right for them to assume - doesn’t mean they’re unable/not responsible to be self-informed about the different modalities for learning. Khan Academy has an app and a lot of K-12 schools use their content. Not everyone learns the same way after all.

DND features can be used successfully to where notifications aren’t ringing every minute, and either kids can set them or parents using controls. A good amount of parents see the value in mobile education and given the current state of the world when it comes to the Coronavirus, we’re likely to see that increase ten fold here soon."

Dato che qui molti spesso lo chiedono, ecco la risposta:


Let’s talk about symptoms. The largest study we have to date is from Wuhan and the Chinese WHO report. It’s actually quite interesting. Let’s take a look together:

**The most common symptoms are:** 

* fever (87.9%)
* dry cough (67.7%)
* fatigue (38.1%) - these are definitely “mild”

**The next most common were:**

* sputum production (33.4%)
*  shortness of breath (18.6%)
* sore throat (13.9%)
* headache (13.6%), 
* myalgia or arthralgia (14.8%) aka muscle aches or joint pains
*  chills (11.4%)
* nausea or vomiting (5.0%) - you might see these with the flu as well

**Things that seem to be quite rare:** 

* nasal congestion (4.8%)
* diarrhea (3.7%) 
* hemoptysis (coughing up blood) (0.9%)
* conjunctival congestion (0.8%) 

**Things we classified as very severe disease (about 13.8% have this)**

* dyspnea (shortness of breath while speaking)
* Breathing more than 30 breaths a minute
* blood oxygen saturation ≤93%, 
* Some lab data: PaO2/FiO2 ratio <300, and/or lung infiltrates >50% of the lung field within 24-48 hours)

**6.1% are critical** (respiratory failure, septic shock, and/or multiple organ dysfunction/failure)


**TLDR Mild really does mean mild, and runny nose/ runny eyes probably means you dont have COVID. If you're breathing fast or can't catch your breath while speaking, that is severe and you should be seen by a doctor immediately**"

Dear Beach Community:

As we’ve communicated over the past few weeks, we’ve been engaged in ongoing planning since the emergence of novel coronavirus, or COVID-19. While there are no cases of COVID-19 related to our campus, as a preventative measure and with trusted medical advice, we are temporarily suspending the in-person, on-campus convening of classes. 

This action is a proactive step being taken because of our commitment to your health and safety and supports the concept of “social distancing.” Research shows that reducing the concentration of people in an area can lower the infection risk for everyone involved. As the number of cases grow in Los Angeles County, this step very well may save lives and it is on the advice of our medical professionals that we take this step.

To allow our faculty to make final preparations for alternative delivery of instruction, face-to-face classes are canceled from Thursday, March 12 through Tuesday, March 17, although the campus will remain open. Alternative instruction will begin on Wednesday, March 18. Online classes will continue as scheduled.

Some courses will continue to meet in person if alternative instruction is not appropriate, such as some laboratory, performing-arts, and physical-education courses. Accommodations associated with social distancing will be implemented in these courses.

Students: please look for communications from instructors about plans for individual courses. Reach out to your instructors if you have questions.

We are currently anticipating the conclusion of alternative delivery of instruction and resumption of regular operations on Monday, April 20 barring any change in our safety assessments.

The campus is not closing. Campus offices and buildings will remain open and many operations will continue normally, including student housing and related dining facilities. Our Beach Athletics teams will continue to compete. Students who need computers or WiFi will find appropriate resources on campus in the library and Horn Tech Center.

Staff should continue to report to work on site. However, as noted in a recent campus email, if you have an underlying health concern that you believe puts you in a high-risk group, you may investigate an accommodation.

The university has developed a framework for assessing what events may be booked, rescheduled, or canceled. No new third-party events will be scheduled for dates prior to May 1. The framework assesses whether or not the event experience can be offered in an alternative way; if participants will be traveling by air to attend; if participants are from populations that are high-risk for infection; if social-distancing and other preventative procedures can be successfully implemented; and what guidance is offered by public-health officials.

This action, I know, will cause great hardship. It is, however, the appropriate action for our community to take.

I know there are many questions and as the situation with COVID-19 evolves in our community we will continue to update you through email and our COVID-19 informational website. Currently on the website you can find up-to-date health information, along with additional information about “social distancing”.

Whether on campus or not, enhance your personal efforts to avoid infection. Washing hands and social distance are two vital strategies for health during this difficult time."

NSW’s chief health officer Kerry Chant has predicted 1.5 million people in the state - or 20 per cent of the population - may be infected with coronavirus.

Giving evidence to a NSW budget estimates committee on health, Dr Chant said modelling undertaken by the government indicated that each person infected was likely to pass the disease to two other people.

Community transmission of the virus is already occurring in NSW, with a small cluster of cases in the northwest of Sydney. NSW’s cases rose by 12 overnight, and authorities do not know how four of the new cases contracted the virus.

“We’ve got early evidence of limited community transmission and now is the time we are continuing our endeavours to contract, trace and isolate cases,” Dr Chant said.

She said NSW was “nowhere near the peak” of infections. The number of cases in the state stands at 77 amid a national total of more than 130 cases.

The ACT has also today recorded its first case."

Italiano, scrivo dal Regno Unito. Seguo da vicino la situazione (leggo giornali online, parlo con amici, ascolto ogni giorni la radio — btw Radio Popolare sta fornendo un servizio eccellente, la consiglio!)


Oggi ho iniziato a pensare a un'auto-restrizione volontaria del mio stile di vita (in linea con [questo sito](https://staythefuckhome.com/), che era in trending oggi su reddit, e che consiglio di condividere). Mi ha stupito il confrontarmi con la mia compagna, Inglese, e ancora nella fase, come dire...Italia 15/20 giorni fa? Io ho cercato di farle capire, per farla breve, che ha senso fare quanto possibile ora (ragionevolmente) per rendersi utili in termini di protezione collettiva, ho parlato di curva, etc. Ma lei era ancora al 'ma *di certo non significherà che non posso fare X e Y*' — e io 'beh, fra un po' potremmo trovarci costretti a rinunciare a ciò a cui ora possiamo rinunciare volontariamente, contribuendo positivamente bla bla bla'. Immagino abbiate ben presente il tipo di discussione.


Vado al punto: in quanto Italiani all'estero, abbiamo la responsabilità di sensibilizzare le persone nei paesi che ci ospitano in vari modi. Anche se doveste passare per paranoici, è meglio esserlo e instillare il dubbio che la cosa potrebbe essere seria che essere addotti come prova che non c'è nulla da temere. Ne sappiamo di più, nel senso che abbiamo più consapevolezza di come possono evolvere le cose, e perché abbiamo assistito al percorso fra tutte le fasi psicologiche, per così dire. 


Nulla, solo un invito a esser consapevoli del ruolo che potete avere in queste, che potrebbero essere le fasi cruciali nei paesi in cui vi trovate."

All others (Tulane, Dillard, Xavier and Delgado) should really do the same thing. Delgado especially because a lot of students are adults that already work in healthcare environments. 

It's not about calculating risk for the average person. It's about how unfair it is to immunocompromised students to have to choose between attendance credit, or worse. In some labs, if you miss over 3 classes you get booted from the lab even if they're excused. Schools are important hotspots for infectious diseases. So far what we know about this virus is that it can [travel over 14 feet and stay in the air](https://www.techtimes.com/articles/247899/20200310/study-coronavirus-carriers-can-infect-you-as-far-as-14-feet-away-and-stays-less-than-an-hour-in-the-air.htm) and can survive on surfaces between [2 to 28 days](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/amp/articles/coronaviruses-how-long-can-they-survive-on-surfaces).

We'll have an email from Khator by this evening, I bet.

Edit: downvote all you want, UH couldn't do anything but prepare until a state of emergency was declared. That's how Texas higher ed works.

Now that it's been declared, the transition pieces are being finalized/activated and we'll hear about it by this evening."

I think people think about the 5-14 day period before showing symptoms and think they are suddenly infecting every single person they come into contact with. 

WHO seem to suggest that the average person with Coronavirus will only infect 1-3 people and that people are MUCH less likely to spread it when they aren't showing symptoms. 

It's not all sunshine and lollipops, but there's definitely some silver linings and if you're not yet showing symptoms then you shouldn't be too worried about infecting people you know"
