I get wanting to fight blatant misinformation but that is much better done by just leaving the thread and linking to proper information. Free speech and free information can beat down bad ideas better than censorship and driving people into smaller subs by banning them for not agreeing with the official reports. 

Some people may try deliberately spread lies but lots of people will be posting just scared and wanting to discuss something. Being called an idiot or deleted by mods would only drive those people deeper into conspiracies as opposed to just trying to let people discuss or explaining why something may not be true."

If you see certain misinformation that comes up why not leave the post up and sticky a comment with debunking information? That would be 1000 times more helpful to stop bad info. Also not make you look like total lying dickheads who wanna control the narrative. 

If its mostly similar conspiracies you could probably even have several copy and pasted responses ready to go when the posts crop up. they people could see them and realize why they are wrong, not just see ""hey the mods are censoring this, they must really not want you to know about it!""

Censoring everything breeds conspiracy and nothing will do that more than hostile take over of a sub and deleting 80% of posts or and posts that are considered ""not reliable"" is bullshit.

IF you guys can prove something is misinformation do it. In the thread and let people see it. That would be how you stop misinformation and conspiracies. What you are doing now is the way to make the entire thing 10X worse.

If you can't prove its misinformation then maybe just maybe it shouldn't be deleted... Maybe someone with more info than you can point out why its misinformation and then the people who see the comments could learn. Or maybe, even more shocking to you mods, one of you could be wrong... Maybe accept that you shouldn't be the one to decide what the masses get to know about this issue. Let it be worked out in the market place of ideas and all that. Free speech, remember that? You know thing that have allowed us to get to the bottom of things for ages. The thing that only gets taken away when people wanna lie and control the narrative...

You don't need to delete everything to control misinformation. You delete everything when you want to control a narrative, not when you want people to reach the correct conclusion based on the information.

Stop this bullshit and let people process the information for ourselves and decide. You had a sub that was run the way you want to make this one. There's no reason they need to be identical."

I literally just found this sub yesterday. I thought you guys have been doing well at the other sub and have been there for awhile. But I subbed here to see the different content, not to watch you make them be the exact same thing. This is super annoying to see. Let people decide for themselves what info they want to trust. It's not your job just cuz you took it through reddit's bad system.

Even if you were running the other sub better than this one(which I would agree you were) there is no good reason to have both subs about this exist and be run by the same people and the exact same way. That is redundant and pointless. It seems really weird that a group of mods wanna take over the other source of info and shut it down basically by deleting most posts when nobody wants them there or asked for them.

Go away mods, up votes and downvotes and making a good argument against a stupid conspiracy does better than you looking like you are trying to hide in info which will just confirm to the craziest people all their worst fears.

Edit: I get deleting straight up racism but anything else is really stupid and 80% of posts including things like the guy you replied to is mentioning just because ""comments get out of hand quickly"" is nazi-mod levels.

Hell if there are conspiracies you can debunk just make a comment and sticky the debunking with links. If they are crazy anyway it should be simple. Explain why something is wrong if you know it is wrong. Hiding it all looks like you are just trying to well... hide it all. You know, like people do when they cover up a conspiracy. You will feed into it. Conspiracy theorists can be deleted easily, but if you do they will return and in greater numbers."

2020-01-28,Neither_Stock,Coronavirus,8,https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/ev9ilq/ways_to_avoid_virus_and_stay_healthy/ffua25o/,"Well, I think that is likely assumptions based on the fact Corona virus LIKE ALMOST ALL VIRUSES can die to extreme heat and alcohol. The whole “scientist figured out it could die to heat and alcohol” is a no brainer. The sauna thing might be helpful because it helps you sweat out a lot of foreign stuff, but to my knowledge the amount of alcohol you would need to drink to kill the virus would kill you before the virus dies. The best way to stay healthy is wash your hands for 20 seconds with soap and warm water, wear a mask AND GOGGLES to avoid contamination, and just sanitize any and all surfaces your hand constantly touches. However, don’t be too worried even if you get it, almost all foreign cases of Corona Virus are either stable or recovered. The virus itself isn’t that bad from what I understand, it just seems to have a high rate of contamination. In other countries with 1-2 cases it’s easy to isolate and provide 3-10 different medical professionals to deal with them, but in China it is extremely difficult for the few medical workers available to deal with the 900 in critical condition and other 3600~ who have symptoms."

2020-01-28,Mr_CIean,Coronavirus,8,https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/evajz2/i_do_not_understand_the_panic/ffugjof/,">The mortality rate is about the same as the flu; once you take in account the likelihood and estimated number of unreported cases.

I'm not one to panic... but this is as outrageously speculative as people claiming crazy high mortality. First, there are people in critical condition. Second, there are articles (from sources like the WSJ) that mention how it's very possible that deaths are being under reported, too.

I personally don't think the mortality rate will end up being that high but there is no evidence that it's as low as the flu and no expert has made that claim and seem to indicate a best guess is much higher than the flu.

Also, spread rate matters, even if they are the same - spread to 10 times as many people and you've got 10 times the amount dead."

You guys have your opinions and want to control the narrative of the subs to fit them. You need to stop.  

Saying things like 
>“I’m leaving this up just so the sub can see how idiotic you are”

shows what a joke your mod team is and if you were going to be dumb while moderating one sub that is one thing but the same apparently fairly shitty group of mods taking over them all is idiotic. You should all step down. You aren't helping at all. You are making things worse."

Do I actually believe you work for someone and are paid to control the narrative? no. I know there are plenty of people dumb enough to do something stupid like this on their own time. But also if you were covering it up is this exactly how it would be done? yup. That will ruin your credibility.  

If you see certain misinformation that comes up why not leave the post up and sticky a comment with debunking information? That would be 1000 times more helpful to stop bad info. Also not make you look like total lying dickheads who wanna control the narrative.

Censoring everything breeds conspiracy and nothing will do that more than hostile take over of a sub and deleting 80% of posts or and posts that are considered ""not reliable"" is bullshit. 

IF you guys can prove something is misinformation do it. In the thread and let people see it. That would be how you stop misinformation and conspiracies. What you are doing now is the way to make the entire thing 10X worse. 

If you can't prove its misinformation then maybe just maybe it shouldn't be deleted... Maybe someone with more info than you can point out why its misinformation and then the people who see the comments could learn. Or maybe, even more shocking to you mods, one of you could be wrong... Maybe accept that you shouldn't be the one to decide what the masses get to know about this issue. Let it be worked out in the market place of ideas and all that. Free speech, remember that? You know thing that have allowed us to get to the bottom of things for ages. The thing that only gets taken away when people wanna lie and control the narrative...

You don't need to delete everything to control misinformation. You delete everything when you want to control a narrative, not when you want people to reach the correct conclusion based on the information. 

Stop this bullshit and let people process the information for ourselves and decide. You had a sub that was run the way you want to make this one. There's no reason they need to be identical."

The mortality rate is \~3% which is probably an overestimation because it's based on reported cases. There are probably a lot of people with the virus with mild symptoms who are just sitting it out without going to the hospital.

>Separately, the Justice Department charged Yanqing Ye, a student at Boston University’s departments of physics, chemistry and biomedical engineering, with lying on her visa application and failing to disclose that she was a lieutenant in China’s People’s Liberation Army. FBI agents found evidence that she was carrying out tasks for her military superiors, such as conducting research, assessing U.S. military websites and sending U.S. documents to China, the Justice Department said.



> The third case announced Tuesday was against Zaosong Zheng, who worked as a cancer researcher at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston from 2018 to 2019. Zheng is accused of trying to smuggle 21 vials of biological research material back to China in a sock in his luggage.

In places like this they sell live animals in close quarters with the butchered ones. Imagine a piggy eating up some of that live bat poop and then the virus growing in the piggy. Piggy gets slaughtered and sold in the same place. We still touch the raw meat before we cook it. The meat touches other things in the market and people touch that and the butcher... Not saying that is the case here but there is too much contact in between to just say cooking it should kill the virus. Bats already carry coronavirus in some form

2020-01-28,Neither_Stock,Coronavirus,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/evgnf0/coronavirus_vs_h1n1/ffvlx3q/,"By my guess it seems h1n1 isn’t too severe on symptoms while Wuhan Corona supposedly causes pneumonia which is pretty bad. It’s a correlation of ability to kill to rate of infection. Wuhan Corona has been infecting at a graph similar to a log graph meaning 2000 cases can quickly become 10000. Considering it’s only been a month these infection numbers are seemingly going to soar. It also seems more difficult for medical professionals to treat because the pneumonia combined with sheer amount infected in China makes it difficult. In the US we didn’t have this problem because they isolated and treated the people nearly immediately before it spread and the numbers became radical. Overall, I think the panic is coming mainly from the potentiality it has because high contagiousness and high ability to kill beats out high contagiousness and low ability to kill. Also I think because it was a flu it was likely easier to solve because influenza viruses are similar meaning normal flu vaccines already have a strong topic basis, but a SARS more MERS vaccines exist to create a basis for the Wuhan Corona virus."

Which is silly, because you could have a much higher mortality rate being hidden by the rate of infection & the long duration this virus takes to cause death. The Lancet study of one of the initial infected clusters https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(20)30183-5/fulltext gives a mortality rate of 15%. However these individuals had access to a Chinese hospital system not clogged up at the time with a pandemic, with intensive care units available to those who needed it. Personally I believe the mortality rate could be as high as 30 or 40% in the event a regions hospital system reaches maximum capacity, mostly effecting older folk with underlying medical conditions like heart disease. But this is ignoring the potential for impact on the normal economic activity of a region essential to keep society operating as normal. This aspect could indirectly reduce outcomes for everyone."

With this in mind, there are a few things you can do to ease anxieties and help prepare yourself IF the virus isn’t contained and we see worse conditions in the coming weeks. 

- Purchase a few dozen N95 masks. These are good to have around anyway, I used a lot in Australia during the recent bushfires and often wear them if I’m sick and travelling. 

- Ensure you have enough water and food at home to bunker down and ride out a few weeks if necessary. Recommendations are 2L of water per adult per day. 

- If the virus spreads in your area or there are worries of spreading avoid leaving the house if possible, or at least congested public areas. 

- Avoid airports and international travel."

The virus causes pneumonia. Those who have fallen ill are reported to suffer coughs, fever and breathing difficulties. In severe cases there can be organ failure. As this is viral pneumonia, antibiotics are of no use. The antiviral drugs we have against flu will not work. If people are admitted to hospital, they may get support for their lungs and other organs as well as fluids. Recovery will depend on the strength of their immune system. Many of those who have died are known to have been already in poor health.

The virus so far has only killed elderly people and ones who previously had existing conditions.

The virus didn’t start last week, it has been going on for quite some time now. So far no one has died outside of China. People outside of China are in stable conditions and should eventually recover. 

Some people have already recovered.

The hypothetical complexity of the system begins with the south america which isnt nearly as densely populated as china or their neighbor India. Both of these populations are vastly greater than south american megacities. So throw out any numbers that you may have for results of an outbreak. 

Second, is control of the spread. I did not see control of the breakout just that it was a breakout. This is important because the timing at which a breakout happens would play a hefty roll. Such that, if the breakout was contained for the next 3 months and then suddenly breaks out worldwide, our chances of having a vaccine or potential vaccine would be greater. Especially if it is fast-tracked as is being discussed right now. 

Fortunately, the 2019.ncov genomes have already been [mapped](https://www.statnews.com/2020/01/24/dna-sleuths-read-coronavirus-genome-tracing-origins-and-mutations/)d, and are  available to the public. This places us at a much higher chance to find a potential treatment quickly. This may not have been accounted for by the model.

With an R0 value of 2.6-3.5, as the most recent paper I've read on it states, in order to stop the virus our control measures need to prevent over 60% of the infections that would happen without them. While masks and hand hygiene go a long way, quarantining the sick takes that percentage into the range we need to be in. If you're currently healthy and your city is quarantined, just stay home. If you're sick but doing okay, call the hotlines we'll be setting up before you leave to seek medical attention and if they tell you to stay home, STAY HOME. 

That being said, I'm an infectious disease clinician, so I've been prepared to be quarantined with the sick for years and might not realize how others will look at it. I can imagine the CDC has a better handle on the sociological factors and are trying to avoid hysteria (even though I don't understand why quarantine would cause hysteria- can someone elaborate for me?)"

First recorded case (patient zero) was a man on the 01/12/19 who had never been to, or near the seafood market where the Chinese government says this all started, so it can’t be the source. The market was a secondary cluster and did cause this thing to spread far and fast, but it can’t be the source. Then there’s other things like you’d of thought by now we’d at least know if this thing was even airborne, but no, still shrouded in mystery this virus. Then there’s the massive reaction to lockdown 56m people, SARS didn’t even get that sort of response.
