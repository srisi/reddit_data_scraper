Most people likely can’t afford to come back, and even if you can afford to drop $3-5,000 on a ticket, you probably won’t be able to get a spot anyways because there are so few planes. US airlines suspended their flights to and from China since the travel ban. The only option is a Chinese flight, which are also very limited. They could also potentially travel to another neighboring country then take a flight to the US, but that would be even more expensive and there are also very few flights. Many US citizens, Canadians, etc are all stuck in China right now, even if they aren’t in Wuhan."

From this we can calculate, that *out of the resolved cases*:

    (259 deaths) / (511 total resolved) = 51% died and 49% recovered

We have to keep in mind that it takes longer for person to recover than to die from the illness, and hospitals do tests only for the most severely ill ones, so the above calculation isn't a good representation of the actual chances of dying of this flu.

#World Health Organization

The only number given out by World Health Organization (WHO) so far has been a case fatality rate (CFR), which is the number of deaths divided by total confirmed cases. 

    (259 deaths) / (11374 confirmed cases) = 2% case fatality rate

While this is the correct way to calculate case fatality rate, this number doesn't give accurate estimation of the actual mortality rate of the flu, because it is an ongoing situation where majority of the confirmed cases are still unresolved. We don't have the information of whether the unresolved cases end up recovering or dying.

WHO themselves mentioned in the same [press conference](https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/media-resources/press-briefings#): ""*The only number currently known is how many people have died out of those who have been reported to the WHO...it is therefore very early to make any conclusive statements about what the overall mortality rate will be*"".

#The Lancet Study

https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(20)30211-7/fulltext

A study published in The Lancet tracked 99 confirmed cases from Wuhan Jinyintan Hospital. Death rate in that study was **11%**. We have to keep in mind that people in this study were not young an healthy to begin with.

#Reported Numbers vs Reality

The reported numbers only include those who have been tested positive for the virus. A lot of the actual infections will go undiagnosed because Chinese hospitals don't have enough test kits to test everyone. Also, majority of people with symptoms will choose to stay at home instead of going to the overcrowded hospitals where infected are gathered and spreading the virus around.  There have even been cases where people were tested positive for the virus and had no symptoms at all, so we really have no idea of the true number of infected people. However, we can safely assume that total number of infected is much much more than the reported confirmed cases.

There's also the very likely possibility that even the reported numbers are inaccurate, as China's officials could be reporting much lower numbers (of both infected and dead) for various political and economic reasons. 

Even if the true number of deaths would be a lot higher than reported, the actual number of infected could easily be higher than 200 000 which means the mortality rate is still low. It's very unlikely that mortality rate of this illness ends up being higher than **5%**.

#Comparison

For comparison, the case fatality rate of similar viruses and seasonal flu: 

* SARS (**11%**)
* MERS (**35%**)
* Seasonal Flu (**less than 0.01%.**)"

I think what I worry about is the SuperBowl on Sunday. Thousands of people all in one place sitting side by side and in close proximity to one another. If one person who is infected (who may or may not be showing symptoms) goes and infects just one other person, hellfire and brimstone very possibly break loose after everyone returns to their homes. It will be impossible to track down that many people and figure out who may have been infected. No one can expect thousands of people, especially Americans (Home of the Free, remember?) to sit back and self-quarantine. There will be at least a few people who refuse and if one of those rebellious people is infected, shit could hit the fan. Now, that may or may not happen, but it just goes to show that I wouldn't get too cocky about being ""safe.""

Also, even if the west is safe. No more cases. Yay. There's still a huge economic toll that will hit.

People average age 55 reported to the hospital, 80% were coughing and half of them had CT's which showed fluid in the lungs. 75% were treated for 3 days but some as long as 22. 17 were on life support and 11 of those died of multiple organ failure.

  


So I would say many are asymptomatic for the average incubation time of 5 days (2-14), after 3 days they start developing light flue simptoms and shedding, for healthy 10-40 year olds this continues for up to 2 weeks and they're done, for 55 year olds it gets worse they have trouble breathing, most will be ok after a few days of fever and assisted oxigen, but the rest will develop pneumonia and bacteria infections and need to be put in life support for a month.

  


The 33 year old German is a food example, he had a training at work by a woman from Wuhan who flew from Shanghai, and back again only to be found landing back in China. A week later over the weekend he developed light flu simptoms but decided to still go to work, when he found out about the woman trainer he went and got tested and he was positive, he's still in very good condition as we speak but his son has now(4 days later) also tested positive even though he was negative when his father was tested."

By Tracy You For Mailonline17:02 GMT 31 Jan 2020 , updated 03:22 GMT 01 Feb 2020

Communities around China have ordered their residents to stop keeping pets - or risk getting them culled - amid fears that animals could also catch the new coronavirus that has killed 213 in less than three weeks, MailOnline can reveal.

Residential committees, village officials and companies from various provinces and municipalities issued the strict order to locals after receiving instructions from their superiors to tackle the epidemic, it has emerged.

One village in Hebei urged all households to 'deal with' their pets within five days, otherwise officials would 'handle' them altogether; while another residential committee in Shaanxi instructed people to 'consider the overall situation' and dispose of their cats and dogs immediately, according to notices supplied to MailOnline.

The news came as China's top expert for infectious diseases warned that pets would also need to be quarantined should they be exposed to coronavirus patients, causing fears that animals could also catch the disease.

The World Health Organisation, however, claims that it has not seen any evidence of the virus being passed onto cats or dogs.

In Wuhan, the ground zero of the coronavirus outbreak, one neighbourhood banned its residents from letting their cats, dogs and livestock leave their homes. In a flyer posted in the community, local officials threatened to catch, kill and bury the animals on the spot if they see any. 

While the authority of one residential complex in Shanghai forbade its residents from feeding stray animals to 'enforce the control and prevention of the epidemic', a separate document reads. 

Similar commands have appeared in provinces and municipalities across the country, including Beijing, Tianjin, Shandong, Heilongjiang, Hebei, Wuhan, Shanxi and Shanghai, according to animal welfare organisation Humane Society International.  


The city of Anshan in Liaoning Province instructed all pet markets to stop trading temporarily and its police forces to 'strictly restrict' residents from walking their pet dogs in public in an urgent notice released this week. 

It also banned the locals from flying their pigeons and demanded all stray wild pigeons be culled as the outbreak accelerated. 

Dr Peter J. Li, China Policy Specialist of Humane Society International, said the organisation had noticed memos issued by Chinese local authorities ordering the banning and even killing of dogs and stray cats. 

'This is not the right approach for local authorities in China to deal with the national crisis that can be traced to China's out-of-control wildlife trade,' Dr Li told MailOnline.

'Companion animals did not contribute to the outbreak of SARS in 2002-2003. They do not have anything to do with the Wuhan epidemic,' he added.

In Dr Li's opinion, such orders could undermine the national effort to curb the outbreak by 'pulling much needed efforts and resources away from the real battleground'. 

'Their acts also show that many of China's local officials lack the competency to run the Chinese society,' he concluded. 

One Beijing-based online vendor however told MailOnline that he was selling 10 times the number of special face masks for dogs every day than before as people were rushing to buy the protective covers for their pooches. 

The deadly Chinese coronavirus outbreak began at a wholesale animal market in Wuhan city, experts confirmed on Sunday.

Scientists from the Chinese Centre for Disease Control and Prevention said tests proved humans caught it from animals at the Huanan Seafood Wholesales Market.

It is not clear which animal was carrying the pneumonia-like illness but the market was home to stalls trading dozens of different species, including rats and wolf cubs. 

The coronavirus has now infected every region of China. Chinese officials have now confirmed more than 9,750 cases, while more than 100 have been recorded outside of nation – taking the toll to more than 9,900.

Deaths have also risen to 213, with 43 patients dying in one day - the biggest 24-hour jump since the outbreak began last month.  

Two people in England were diagnosed with the Wuhan coronavirus today, making the UK the 23rd country or territory outside of China to have caught the virus. 

After the World Health Organisation last night declared the coronavirus outbreak to be a global health emergency, it has also emerged."

This is the main reason of death caused by this virus.

While seasonal flu can sometimes cause pneumonia, which itself can be dangerous, it is nowhere near as serious as ARDS. If a person develops ARDS, the only way to survive it is to have pressurized oxygen supplying enough oxygen to them until lungs are clear of the liquids. You won't survive outside of hospital environment once it progresses into ARDS."

Your own link to the Lancet journal indicates this. Specifically, ""Phylogenetic analysis revealed that 2019-nCoV fell within the subgenus Sarbecovirus of the genus Betacoronavirus, with a relatively long branch length to its closest relatives bat-SL-CoVZC45 and bat-SL-CoVZXC21, and was genetically distinct from SARS-CoV."" Which is to say, it is not abnormal for a coronavirus at all. It's different, yes, as all different types of coronavirus are. The common cold is a coronavirus, and it's ""abnormal"" compared to SARS and compared to this new virus. That difference is relatively meaningless.

The journal article you've linked has been roundly criticized. In fact, your own Lancet journal article confounds their findings without intending to when they discuss the relationship between the genetic differences and the database profile. They even prognosticate a bit there about the most likely connections (hint, it's not HIV) on the way to indicating a third-party transmission between the bat forms, the animal intermediary, and its evolution into something with the ability for human transmission.

Your article about the Harvard researcher is unrelated and connected only by your paranoia. And just because a virus is ""new"" and ""different"" than other viruses does not mean that it is any more or less infectious or deadly. Viruses evolve novel forms *all the time;* this is partially why the flu shot changes every year. The R0 and mortality rate is still in dispute, but the idea that this is anything more than a naturally evolved viral mutation is absurd and and posting crap like this is irresponsible on your part."

A good bioweapon is one that can do a clean wipe of an area quickly.  Not incubate for two weeks and give most relatively mild sympoms.

Did it originate as an animal coronovirus that they were working with using crispr, etc?  There's a significant nonzero chance.  

But that would raise the question of how it got out.  Level 4 labs have multiple overlapping redundancies in policy and infrastructure to prevent anything getting out.
If this beast escaped it's lair in the lab, my money is that it got out by infecting a worker who worked with test animals, particularly a non-symptomatic test animal.  Someone gets sloppy and rubs a bit of monkey snot into their eye, and a then several days later goes to buy some fresh fish.   

Remember that the first four confirmed cases had no connection with the market, although it was a source of the outbreak."

The widely quoted number of around 2% is very misleading. That number is calculated as deaths divided by total confirmed cases. It implicitly assumes that every single infected person not yet dead will make a full recovery (including critical patients). At the start of any outbreak it will significantly understate mortality rate. The WHO has admitted that it is misleading and understates actual mortality - it is the reason why SARS was initially claimed to have a mortality rate below 4% ([source](http://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2003/05/estimates-sars-death-rates-revised-upward)).

On the flip side confirmed cases certainly doesn’t represent all of the cases so that’s a counteracting force that could lower mortality rate.

The truth is we don’t have a solid idea of mortality rate yet and won’t for a while."

#Cases

[As of Jan 31, 2020 7 pm ET](https://gisanddata.maps.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html#/bda7594740fd40299423467b48e9ecf6) we have total 11374 confirmed cases:

* 259 deaths
* 252 recovered
* 10863 unresolved 

From this we can calculate, that *out of the resolved cases*:

    (259 deaths) / (511 total resolved) = 51% died and 49% recovered

We have to keep in mind that it takes longer for person to recover than to die from the illness, and hospitals do tests only for the most severely ill ones, so the above calculation isn't a good representation of the actual chances of dying of this flu.

#World Health Organization

The only number given out by World Health Organization (WHO) so far has been a case fatality rate (CFR), which is the number of deaths divided by total confirmed cases. 

    (259 deaths) / (11374 confirmed cases) = 2% case fatality rate

While this is the correct way to calculate case fatality rate, this number doesn't give accurate estimation of the actual mortality rate of the flu, because it is an ongoing situation where majority of the confirmed cases are still unresolved. We don't have the information of whether the unresolved cases end up recovering or dying.

WHO themselves mentioned in the same [press conference](https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/media-resources/press-briefings#): ""*The only number currently known is how many people have died out of those who have been reported to the WHO...it is therefore very early to make any conclusive statements about what the overall mortality rate will be*"".

#The Lancet Study

https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(20)30211-7/fulltext

A study published in The Lancet tracked 99 confirmed cases from Wuhan Jinyintan Hospital. Death rate in that study was **11%**. We have to keep in mind that people in this study were not young an healthy to begin with.

#Reported Numbers vs Reality

The reported numbers only include those who have been tested positive for the virus. A lot of the actual infections will go undiagnosed because Chinese hospitals don't have enough test kits to test everyone. Also, majority of people with symptoms will choose to stay at home instead of going to the overcrowded hospitals where infected are gathered and spreading the virus around.  There have even been cases where people were tested positive for the virus and had no symptoms at all, so we really have no idea of the true number of infected people. However, we can safely assume that total number of infected is much much more than the reported confirmed cases.

There's also the very likely possibility that even the reported numbers are inaccurate, as China's officials could be reporting much lower numbers (of both infected and dead) for various political and economic reasons. 

Even if the true number of deaths would be a lot higher than reported, the actual number of infected could easily be higher than 200 000 which means the mortality rate is still low. It's very unlikely that mortality rate of this illness ends up being higher than **5%**.

#Comparison

For comparison, the case fatality rate of similar viruses and seasonal flu: 

* SARS (**11%**)
* MERS (**35%**)
* Seasonal Flu (**less than 0.01%.**)"

As one of them, I will say: we are concerned, we want to err on the side of action and caution *because* there are unknowns, *because* we don't know if this is apocalypse level, or mini-apocalypse, of mild inconvenience or what.

There's also been a steady record of right wing populist authoritarian governments all over the world as well, replete with death squads, propaganda, and political coverups. In fact the tendency to install a Great Leader is a paternalistic impulse, which paleoconservative political philosophy explicitly endorses.

Based on what I have seen and read this panic is more harmful than not. 

People cherrypick and pick quotes out of context to prove that there is cause for panic. And this shit gets upvoted.

Several articles have been written that warn about the poor adherence to proper infectious disease handling protocols in Chinese research and testing laboratories. Articles also detail several instances where SARS escaped from laboratories via infection of lab workers in both China (2004) and Singapore (2003). Therefore, it is not stretch by any means that this may have been the potential cause of the current 2019-nCoV outbreak.

im not defending china goverment itself,
but from medical stats view, this stats seems reasonable when you taje in consideration other factors involved in the case.

first of all this stats said in clear way 11307 confirmed, underline word "" confirmed "" infection,
this should be said in other words , "" we have tested 20k cases and found 11k cases positive to have the virus "" .

labs cannot checked the 46m ppl at once and report ya the exact and accurrate percentage of infections or count them , however it is been said that there is a bottleneck in testing kits that not allow for more than 2-3 k test per day, and that what make result rise slowly coz e are talking about confirmed, if any expert asked about suspicious cases the lowest number u will get around 200-500k infections, but still this not how official stats produced! 

this virus after passing 30days at least without been isolated, will take the worst pic where many doctors here and bio-experts estimates around 20m infections or even more , but for sure no officail statments will tell "" hi there, we have doubts that the whole ppl of wuhan area is likely be infected "".

just give it a lil time and u will see how numbers will rise up , even if virus is said to be isolated !


Second, for death , recovered rate it looks naturally that death happened by virus infection maybe happened on 2nd day symptoms appeared, but recovered ppl will not be confirmed till 100% all tests show that which take up to 2 weeks from symptoms appeared.

i hope u get the point now"

> There is still a lot that is unknown about the newly emerged 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) and how it spreads. Two other coronaviruses have emerged previously to cause severe illness in people (MERS and SARS). 2019-nCoV is more genetically related to SARS than MERS, but both are betacoronaviruses with their origins in bats. While we don’t know for sure that this virus will behave the same way as SARS and MERS, we can use the information from both of these earlier coronaviruses to guide us. **In general, because of poor survivability of these coronaviruses on surfaces, there is likely very low risk of spread from products or packaging that are shipped over a period of days or weeks at ambient temperatures.** Coronaviruses are generally thought to be spread most often by respiratory droplets. **Currently there is no evidence to support transmission of 2019-nCoV associated with imported goods and there have not been any cases of 2019-nCoV in the United States associated with imported goods.**"

#Cases

[As of Feb 1, 2020 10 am ET] (https://gisanddata.maps.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html#/bda7594740fd40299423467b48e9ecf6) we have total 12024 confirmed cases:

* 259 deaths
* 287 recovered
* 11478 unresolved 

From this we can calculate, that *out of the resolved cases*:

    (259 deaths) / (543 total resolved) = 47% died and 53% recovered

We have to keep in mind that it takes longer for person to recover than to die from the illness, and hospitals do tests only for the most severely ill ones, so the above calculation isn't a good representation of the actual chances of dying of this flu.

#World Health Organization

The only number given out by World Health Organization (WHO) so far has been a case fatality rate (CFR), which is the number of deaths divided by total confirmed cases. 

    (259 deaths) / (12024 confirmed cases) = 2% case fatality rate

While this is the correct way to calculate case fatality rate, this number doesn't give accurate estimation of the actual mortality rate of the flu, because it is an ongoing situation where majority of the confirmed cases are still unresolved. We don't have the information of whether the unresolved cases end up recovering or dying.

WHO themselves mentioned in the same [press conference](https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/media-resources/press-briefings#): ""*The only number currently known is how many people have died out of those who have been reported to the WHO...it is therefore very early to make any conclusive statements about what the overall mortality rate will be*"".

#The Lancet Study

https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(20)30211-7/fulltext

A study published in The Lancet tracked 99 confirmed cases from Wuhan Jinyintan Hospital. Death rate in that study was **11%**. We have to keep in mind that people in this study were not young an healthy to begin with.

#Reported Numbers vs Reality

The reported numbers only include those who have been tested positive for the virus. A lot of the actual infections will go undiagnosed because Chinese hospitals don't have enough test kits to test everyone. Also, majority of people with symptoms will choose to stay at home instead of going to the overcrowded hospitals where infected are gathered and spreading the virus around.  There have even been cases where people were tested positive for the virus and had no symptoms at all, so we really have no idea of the true number of infected people. However, we can safely assume that total number of infected is much much more than the reported confirmed cases.

There's also the very likely possibility that even the reported numbers are inaccurate, as China's officials could be reporting much lower numbers (of both infected and dead) for various political and economic reasons. 

Even if the true number of deaths would be a lot higher than reported, the actual number of infected could easily be higher than 200 000 which means the mortality rate is still low. It's very unlikely that mortality rate of this illness ends up being higher than **5%**.

#Comparison

For comparison, the case fatality rate of similar viruses and seasonal flu: 

* SARS (**11%**)
* MERS (**35%**)
* Seasonal Flu (**less than 0.01%.**)"

India has a quite robust medical system and excellent doctors.
Sure there are a lot of poor people living in unsanitary conditions but it's not like we are caveman with no medical ability.
India is home to many fine hospitals where thousands of people come from around the world to get cheap and reliable procedures done.
There is only one case so far who has been quarinteened.
Other suspected cases are also being watched.

&#x200B;

I came onto this subreddit for information. I read the community description of the subreddit ""This subreddit seeks to monitor the spread of this potential global public health threat."". I was majorly let down and worried that the mass amount of misinformation on here might spread to others, so I created a post to lead others to the sister sub r/China_Flu which is much more appropriate.

&#x200B;

But now, upon reflection, I understand the reasoning for this sub. I suppose it's just for fun really. Scare-mongering is somewhat entertaining and imagining apocalyptic situations however unhelpful and unrealistic, can be fun. My only issue is that the sub represents itself as factual when it's clearly not a place of reliability."

We have no immunity to THIS Coronavirus. There are strains you can come across that won’t do anything because of that immunity. If you come across a virus that an immune system has never encountered then you’re not going to have an immunity to it. If we had an immunity to it the WHO wouldn’t give a shit. We wouldn’t be quarantining, hell we wouldn’t even be worrying. Getting a flu vaccine won’t give you an immunity to something like swine flu. You can’t have an immunity to something that humans have never been exposed too. We have never been exposed to what’s been going around in China. Yes it mutates quickly and this makes it tricky to bring out a shot for it. I’m sure there will be people in China that have been exposed and their immune systems have been able to fight it off. But none have been able to do it without treatment. I would imagine after people have recovered their immune system will be better equipped to prevent you getting ill again. Just because we have an immunity to one of the viruses does NOT mean you will for another. I understand what you’re saying but you cannot have an immunity to something that your body has never encountered."

According to what you are saying it's okay for only one side to express their opinions. In this scenario, for the panicking side. 

Am I deciding for someone by expressing my opinion or observations?

Also it is important for me to figure out whether there is actual cause for concern. I'm going to travel to Thailand soon - should I cancel this trip? If I believed everything that was upvoted or in the headlines in this subreddit, there's no way I would go to Thailand. It would be money wasted and vacation ruined for me.

So this might sound selfish, but it is relevant for me now. But if I evaluate all of this as low risk, it's not selfish, because I imagine it won't hurt the world in a major way.

Now I evaluate posts and comments in this subreddit. I make my observation. I need to express it. Will people agree, will somebody point out a flaw in what I have concluded? It's entirely plausible that I have missed something and the risk I've rated as low is actually not so low and it would actually be wise to cancel the vacation plans."

""In the new report, doctors describe how the man progressed from initially mild, **nonspecific symptoms to pneumonia on the ninth day of his illness**. The patient -- a 35-year-old resident of Snohomish County, Washington, with no history of major health problems -- had returned from visiting family in Wuhan on January 15. He had **not visited the seafood market** where a number of early patients were initially linked, **nor did he have any known contacts with sick people during his visit**. 

Still, the man had seen a health alert by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and decided to visit an urgent care clinic on January 19, at which point he had been **coughing for four days.**     


According to the chart in the article 

* He was **vomiting** of the 4th day to the 6th day 
* **diarrhea** on the 6th day to the 8th day
* **coughing** for 15 days

&#x200B;

This means t**his will spread the same as SARS through diarrhea and vomit** which means any public toilet, hospital toilet, hotel room toilet, sewer systems and any apartment buildings with issues as documented in this study with dry U traps in the floor could become sources of infection.

The Detroit government is notoriously unaccountable and corrupt. People have known and complained about it for years.

Luckily, Detroit is the exception for governance in the US, not the rule. Most towns and cities in the US are very functional. There is enough opposition and turnover to incumbents, freedom of the press and freedom of speech to keep most local and federal government offices accountable.

To say “at least the Chinese government is doing something for the people of Wuhan” is to deny their culpability. Yes, they did something for Wuhan; they arrested anyone trying to sound the alarm and stop the outbreak. They prevented quarantines from happening when they would have been much more effective.

All the effort you see now is the result of their prior incompetence.

I find it highly convenient for your point that you just so happen to have lived in Flint, MI, btw."
