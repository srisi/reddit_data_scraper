Most of the world is only at START + 4.5 Weeks.

(NOTE: the Diamond Princess is at START + 4.5 Weeks and lines up with this timeline pretty well also... with 20 Severe cases they'd just be getting the attention of authorities if they were 1 neighborhood in a major city...)

**Early timeline of coronavirus outbreak in Wuhan (for reflection on how other outbreaks might play out)**

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline\_of\_the\_2019%E2%80%9320\_Wuhan\_coronavirus\_outbreak\_in\_December\_2019\_%E2%80%93\_January\_2020](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_the_2019%E2%80%9320_Wuhan_coronavirus_outbreak_in_December_2019_%E2%80%93_January_2020)

The goal of this post isn't to get into some argument about the specific accuracy of numbers - but goes on the working assumption that the reporting on ""landmark dates"" are pretty close.

See detailed timeline below (or in the Wikipedia page) for specific landmark dates:

* **START**: Some people get nCoV. Medical tracing of virus place outbreak in early to mid Nov.
* **START + between 2-5 weeks**: a symptomatic patient is recorded by healthcare system. (others may have had it, but they didn't stand out enough to be discussed in published investigations about the outbreak.)
* **START + between 5-8 weeks**: there is a large enough influx of serious patients that the outbreak stands out from normal flu/cold season. (Doctors start messaging each other to be careful)
* **START + between 7-10 weeks**: first death attributed to virus (there could have been others earlier mis-identified as cold/flu or not reported - but this lag from outbreak to death seems consistent with progression in international cases.)
* **START + between 9-12 weeks:** Looming healthcare disaster is apparent enough to call for massive mitigation and containment efforts.
* **START + between 11-14 weeks: Explosion of serious/critical cases.**

There are some very rational/logical reasons to expect this timeline **will not** be repeated exactly in other cities.

1. Active efforts to spot and quarantine cases to slow the spread
2. The initial outbreak in Wuhan (early-mid Nov) can be assumed to be more intense because of local sanitary conditions and lack of vigilance. Wuhan began with high-density community transmission from day 1... (Diamond Princess is probably the only place where it could/would have spread faster)

That said, it seems like a lot of communities worldwide (i.e. Indonesia or Cambodia) would be at high risk of this happening there. (They could actually be more prone to high density transmission...)

It also seems unlikely for an outbreak to move any faster than this timeline.

Interestingly, Singapore is at START + 4.5 weeks (first known case arrived Jan 20th). If they were not actively monitoring I don't believe they'd have noticed the unusual spike in in cases yet (but would be very close with 7 serious/critical pneumonia cases at one point)."

That is an odd OR above. So basically those Americans on board now likely are showing no symptoms.  Probably they got tested (negative) in order to leave (Japan testing everyone and letting folk go who test negative). So I guess then Americans who leave ship tomorrow or Thursday/Friday are clear on current test and have to wait around Japan 14 days and then sign a statement saying “I have had no symptoms for past 14 days while on Japan mainland”, then they can board.

> Recently, videos about improper methods of front-line epidemic prevention and control staff in Huizhai Village, Mengchao Township have been circulating on WeChat groups and the Internet. The pneumonia epidemic prevention and control headquarters of new coronavirus infection in Mengyang Township attaches great importance to this, and immediately held a special meeting and set up a working group to investigate and handle the incident. After verification, the incident happened: During the epidemic prevention and control period, Jingmou of Huizhai Village, Mengyang Township, did not wear a mask every day, went in and out of the checkpoint multiple times, and did not obey the staff's advice. On February 13, during the critical education of Jingmou, the staff improper methods and excessive behaviors caused adverse effects. The Mengliao Township Epidemic Prevention and Control Headquarters conducted serious criticism and education on the staff and instructed them to conduct a profound review. At present, the public security department has been involved in the investigation and processing. In the next step, we will use this as a lesson to strengthen the prevention and control of the epidemic situation in each village. We will do a good job in epidemic prevention and control in accordance with the law and regulations, and fight against the epidemic.

And, I think you could safely generalize that if this coronavirus we're dealing with can survive for an extended period on surfaces in general, it can also survive on the surface of produce in the fridge for extended periods. 

Unfortunately, the study did not address / study potential decontamination methods.  But hydrogen peroxide is the only one I can think of that is relatively food safe. I wouldn't want to be wiping my produce down with clorox cleanup. UVC light is another potential option. I would just be afraid the light would not penetrate the crevices in the surface of the produce."

Markets are driven by second, third, fourth order thinking. This is first order thinking stuff that the market has already priced in. The reason the market hasn't gone down is because the market knows economic downturn = more fed stimulus. To some extent, the market is already working on the second order effect while the OP is only working on the first order effect, which is not where you want to be, because it makes you the dumb money. If you watch option chains, you can see already that MM expect very bad Q1s due to the coronavirus, so all the puts in the may-june period have already repriced to reflect that.

Where there may be mispricing today is if things are far worse than what the market is expecting and the central banks run out of powder, or if markets actually go exponential from all of the capital flows into the US.  The latter requires quite a bit of an imagination for most people but is much more logical. if you are a true bear, the exodus to safe haven assets will overwhelm US treasuries, and it won't be long before companies are able to literally issue debt for free with which to buy their stocks, sending stocks into an exponential function.

In my hypothesis, you can see I am already working on the fourth order function.

First order -> Economy bad

Second order -> Capital flow moves into safe haven assets

Third order -> Safe assets turn negative, corporate bonds goes to zero. But bonds can only turn so negative.

fourth order -> financial engineering through bond raising, equity buyback, private equity and leveraged products transform debt liquidity into equity liquidity which goes exponential."

>It is improbable that SARS-CoV-2 emerged through laboratory manipulation of an existing SARS-related coronavirus. As noted above, the RBD of SARS-CoV-2 is optimized for human ACE2 receptor binding with an efficient binding solution different to that which would have been predicted. Further, if genetic manipulation had been performed, one would expect that one of the several reverse genetic systems available for betacoronaviruses would have been used. However, this is not the case as the genetic data shows that SARS-CoV-2 is not derived from any previously used virus backbone17"

Contract prices are negotiated ahead of time, too. Prices actually rose in Q4 2019 and have stagnated early this year due to the Coronavirus. It's expected for prices to rise further, anywhere from 20-40% over 2020, but the exact timing of the uptick is in question. Originally it was expected by Q2, then with the virus it was pushed to during or after Q2, and it's lingering later if anything right now.

So the two takeaways are: one, prices take a quarter to correct and two, the Coronavirus actually has *lowered* NAND/SSD prices. This is because largely production has been unaffected (at least initially) and domestic (Chinese) demand is lower due to economic fears. So for that reason people tend not to understand the price pressures because on the one hand there's lag and on the other the impacts are often counterintuitive to the layman. It doesn't help that retail consumer SSDs are just a small part of this equation."

>  
>“这个病人有点脑梗、老年痴呆，送过来时状况很不好，”吴文娟说。她拒绝透露该病人的姓氏。  
>  
>据悉，该病患在发病后，先被送入武汉市的另一家医院，但随着病情恶化，12月29日被转入金银潭医院。当时，黄朝林和吴文娟都在现场。  
>  
>吴文娟表示，这名老人此前便患病在家，并没有前往过华南海鲜市场，后者是武汉一家贩卖海鲜和野味产品的交易集市。由于疫情爆发初期有大量该市场的商户患病，一度被认为是疫情的起源地。  
>  
>“他住在离海鲜市场四五站（公交站）远的地方，”吴文娟说。“而且因为他患病，所以基本上不出门。”

A rough translation by Google Translate of the report in Chinese:

>*Dr. Wenjuan Wu, director of the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) at Jinyintan Hospital and one of the authors of the above papers, told the BBC on Monday (February 17) that the patient who developed the disease on December 1 was a man in his seventies. . The onset time on December 1 was a conclusion drawn from the epidemiological survey of the family members.*  
>  
>*""This patient has a cerebral infarction and senile dementia, and the condition was very bad when he was sent over,"" Wu Wenjuan said. She declined to disclose the patient's last name.*  
>  
>*It is reported that after the onset of the disease, the patient was first admitted to another hospital in Wuhan, but as the condition worsened, he was transferred to Jinyintan Hospital on December 29. At the time, Huang Chaolin and Wu Wenjuan were on the scene.*  
>  
>*Wu Wenjuan said the old man had been sick at home before and had not visited the South China Seafood Market, a trading market in Wuhan that sells seafood and game products. Because a large number of merchants in this market became ill at the beginning of the outbreak, it was once considered the origin of the outbreak.*

That is an odd OR above. So basically those Americans on board now likely are showing no symptoms.  Probably they got tested (negative) in order to leave (Japan testing everyone and letting folk go who test negative). So I guess then Americans who leave ship tomorrow or Thursday/Friday are clear on current test and have to wait around Japan 14 days and then sign a statement saying “I have had no symptoms for past 14 days while on Japan mainland”, then they can board. 

But no retest.  And it does not appear that they will be quarantined after getting back to United States. So policy is kinda good but also kinda interesting."

Professional comedian Frank King was set to perform on a Holland-America Westerdam cruise. That cruise left Hong Kong and was ultimately turned away from four countries before finding refuge in Cambodia.

“It’s kind of like the Hotel California ... I’m not going to check out but I am leaving,” King said.

After the cruise ship docked in Cambodia and passengers were allowed to leave, an American tested positive for the coronavirus, officially known as COVID-19. 

“And then when she tested positive, nobody is leaving the hotel. It wasn’t like an armed camp, but they were watching you. If you walked out with your backpack beside you, that’s fine. If you did like I did and you drag your luggage, they tried to stop you,"" King said. 

King walked out of the hotel and ended up booking a flight from Cambodia to Bangkok. From there, he flew to Dubai and then ultimately landed in Seattle. 

He said the U.S. Customs & Border Patrol were expecting him. 

“They knew. They had my name on the list and they knew. They go ‘are you Mr. King? Were you on the Westerdam?' I said yes. I thought “oh man, I’m going to Guantanamo.’ But because I hadn’t been on mainland China and I’d been outside the incubation period and hadn’t been in close contact with anyone with the flu, they said you are free to go,” King said. 

It took two hours for King to clear customs.  

King plans on renting a car and drive from Seattle to his home in Eugene, Oregon.

In a statement, Holland America said it’s still working with the Cambodian health ministry and are working to clear passengers once they test negative. 

They anticipate this will take several more days."

America seems to have it worse, I notice e.g. in a few recent EU videos on the coronavirus I watched and also a EU brexit summit, they had female presenters who had moderately big breasts, and they were elbow height.  But often in American based videos I Watch they hoisted higher, to around mid elbow shoulder level.  To me that actually looks unnatural knowing how breasts naturally sit.

I hope one day you have the courage to go braless and say sod it to those who dont like it, because the only way society will change is if more and more women say no to peer pressure."

> The quarantine on the ship was scheduled to end Feb. 19, and those who came back to the U.S. a couple of days ahead of the end of the quarantine probably will have to restart the clock on a new 14-day quarantine.

> The Princess Cruises ship was carrying 2,666 guests and 1,045 crew when it set sail and was quarantined after 10 cases of coronavirus were reported Feb. 4.

I can think of likely explanations:

1. CDC is not insisting on tracing because there is no controlling it at this point. The numbers don't seem to be recorded on the CDC -- CDC says NY has 0 cases. They are slow rolling this because they are afraid of panic. ([https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/cases-in-us.html](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/cases-in-us.html))

What next, people on this subreddit are going to say that Wolcen's launch is worse than coronavirus?

Yes, the game has absolutely disappointed people. Yes, it has glaring issues that should be resolved - the front page threads about summoner skills and spell damage scaling are great at actually getting at issues with the game. But saying shit like, ""this game's release is literally unethical""? There are games with worse launches than Wolcen - Anthem, Pathfinder: Kingmaker (which is actually the best comp for Wolcen right now), No Man's Sky (which was actually, literally more unethical for launching without key features promised during development, not merely bugged features). It is obvious that the game has potential - I bought it after launch, knowing of its issues, specifically because of that potential. Server issues can be fixed. Skill balance can be fixed. What Wolcen has is good ARPG design behind it - that is not something that can be added in after the fact.

While I understand why the people on this subreddit, particularly those people who invested in the game early, are upset about the game's launch... they still need to take a fucking chill pill. At the end of the day, it's just a game, one that they have already bought and can revisit a month, two months, six months from now. I don't think it should be called anything other than ""early access"" even at this point (it does baffle me why the devs would release a game with so many untested features), but that's a disparity that isn't unusual in today's world, let alone malicious. Even Path of Exile suffered from desync for years before it finally got fixed, and that was an issue more fundamentally harmful to the game than anything Wolcen is going through right now.

Generally, most people on Reddit lack perspective, and this sub is just the latest example of that."

(Bloomberg) -- Thousands of containers of frozen pork, chicken and beef are piling up at some major Chinese ports as transport disruptions and labor shortages slow operations, people familiar with the matter said.

Deliveries are mounting at ports including Tianjin, Shanghai and Ningbo because there aren’t enough truck drivers to collect containers due to travel curbs imposed in the country to control the coronavirus, said the people, who asked not to be identified because they’re not authorized to speak publicly.

Ports are also starting to run out of electricity points to freeze the containers and some ships have been told to reroute to other destinations in mainland China and Hong Kong, the people said.

China is a massive importer of meat from South America, Europe and also the U.S., and has been boosting purchases to help ease shortages caused by African swine fever. The country increased imports of meat and offal by almost 50% in 2019 to a record of about 6.2 million tons, customs data show.

It remains unclear when port operations will return to normal as truck drivers returning from other cities are quarantined for 14 days and other transport restrictions on trucks remain in place, the people said.

The government encouraged factories to ramp up production this week after extended New Year holidays. Outbreaks of the virus have sickened more than 70,000 and killed over 1,800 in China. More than 220 million migrant workers have not returned on time and may travel in late February or March, Liu Xiaoming, the transport minister, said on Saturday.

The office of the spokesman for the General Administration of Customs in Beijing did not answer phone calls seeking comment.

My post was reshared on Chinese social media: WeChat, Weibo, even the Chinese speaking forums on Reddit.

> SINGAPORE - Temperature screening remains an important measure in the fight against the coronavirus infection as it is effective tool in identifying people who are sick, Health Minister Gan Kim Yong told Parliament on Tuesday (Feb 18).

> He was replying to Ms Rahayu Mahzam (Jurong GRC), who had asked how effective it was, ""because some of the patients who have been discovered showed very mild symptoms. It also uses a lot of manpower and I'm really not sure if it is the best way"".

> Agreeing that there are infected people who present other symptoms before fever, Mr Gan said organisations that are doing the screening should also look out for people who do not appear to be well. ""If he doesn't look well, please advise him to go back and rest rather than rely solely on temperature taking.""

> He also appealed to people who are not feeling well to ""please see a doctor"", and if they remain sick a few days later, to please see the same doctor who would then have the person's history.

> Mr Gan fielded questions from about 10 MPs over the coronavirus outbreak, ranging from why general practitioners (GPs) cannot be given kits to test for the virus, to the risk posed by people returning from China.

> Mr Yee Chia Hsing (Chua Chu Kang GRC) pointed out that several confirmed cases had seen more than one doctor before being sent to hospital. Would it not be better if GPs were given testing kits so they can be sure, he asked.

> Mr Gan replied: ""Every day we have about 30,000 people down with flu-like symptoms like runny nose, cough and cold and so on. So it is not possible to test all 30,000 of them.""

> Furthermore, not all GPs may be familiar with the special techniques required to take the swabs for the test, and ""this can be quite a hazardous process"" that could expose the GP to unnecessary risk should the person have the virus.

> Such tests are better done at hospitals, which have trained personnel and facilities for this.

> Related Story Coronavirus cases in Singapore: What we know so far

> This is also why the multi-ministry task force has recommended that people with such symptoms be given five days of medical leave - most people with the normal cold, for example, would recover in that time, said Mr Gan.

> But those who do not need not panic since there are some illnesses that take longer.

> This is why they should return to the same doctor, who can then make a clinical judgment on whether the person may have the coronavirus.

> He asked employers to allow staff who have been given five days of MC to stay away from work.

> ""And if the doctor gives you an MC, stay at home throughout the MC period. Don't go around and don't go and queue up to buy toilet paper and so on,"" he said, referring to the panic buying that occurred when Singapore raised the risk assessment of the coronavirus outbreak to code orange, the second-highest level.

> ""Please stay at home and if you need help, always there's an MOH hotline that you can call if you need some help. And if you are very ill and you need the ambulance, you can always call for an ambulance and we will convey you to the hospital.""

> As to the risk posed by people returning from China, who will be served 14-day stay-home notices - a measure that kicks in on Feb 18 midnight - Mr Gan emphasised that these are not people who have the coronavirus infection, nor are they close contacts of people who have the virus.

> They are told to stay home for 14 days as they had been exposed to a community that carries that risk. This is to minimise any risk of spread from them, said Mr Gan.

>Date of the report: 9 February 2020 - A new and fast spreading coronavirus was detected in Wuhan, Hubei province, in China at December 2019. Regarding the emergency of this situation, our research group has decided to perform an analysis of this situation by using the Be-CoDiS model. Obtained Forecast: Focusing on China: The epidemic could affect between 57600 and 78422 people, with deaths between 3280 and 4200. The peak (i.e., maximum number of people in stage H) of the epidemic could be reached on 13 February 2020. The epidemic should be over at the end of July 2020. Focusing on the worldwide spread of the disease: The epidemic could affect between 58200 and 79700 people worldwide, with deaths between 3300 and 4230. A number of countries between 25 and 44 could be affected by outbreaks. The whole epidemic could last up to July 2020.

Not a doc here but the normal cold/flu will progress from sore throat, coughing to sneezing and runny nose, whereas Coronavirus will get into your lower respiratory tract, meaning lungs, with more persistent coughing, more chest pain, more violent fevers, even phlegm/liquid build up in your lungs. You might not even have any running nose or sneezing symptoms... If you ever had pneumonia in your life you would know exactly what it feels like...

I know it’s hard to understand why people would care about guns if you have no experience with them, but we have (by an order of several magnitudes) the largest community of amateur shooters in the world, and a longstanding tradition of civil gun ownership since our country was founded. This is very much unique to the United States; Switzerland’s strong shooting traditions are probably the best comparison in the Western world. Most modern countries didn’t struggle to dismantle the robust legal framework surrounding a strong tradition of civil gun ownership, because that robust legal framework never existed for them. It’s a very unique situation; that much we should be able to agree on. 

The gun threat is massively overblown, just like the threat from sp00ky terrorists, or the Coronavirus. Humans are notoriously awful at gauging relative risk, and our 24 hour news cycle certainly doesn’t help. The truth is, you’re far more likely to be killed by a drunk driver than a mass shooter. That doesn’t mean alcohol should be prohibited. It means we, in the framework of a society that respects individual rights and has an understanding of relative risk, should continue to search for new and innovative ways to regulate alcohol (and firearms).

So, yeah. I like guns and I have an infinitesimally small chance of being affected by the types of crimes that are driving the public outrage around guns. There are over 100 million people who would agree with me. When you understand the culture surrounding the right to bear arms in the US, you’d know that repealing the 2A is just gonna be Prohibition all over again."

So, the app notified you that he arrived, and then you just watched the map for 20 minutes? 

Could be that he's primarily an UberEats driver - that's the only service I know of where the customer is expected to meet them at the car (and I'm not even sure if that's still the current policy these days).

As other commenters have mentioned, could be phone troubles other something else random.

But, since he didn't activate the customer unavailable timer (which would have sent you a notification), nor attempt to call or text, that is pretty weird (unless phone not working). 

Some people only use slow chargers or slow charging battery packs, and it can easily take 5-10 minutes for a dead phone to charge, during which time you have absolutely nothing to go on info-wise. Heck, maybe he's even on a prepaid phone and ran out of data, but could still get phone calls, and support gave him the info he needed to get to you.

Anyhow, I don't think those ideas are any more far-fetched than food tampering. Being parked in front of your building where you might come out the door at any moment isn't exactly an ideal location to do such a thing. Nor would such a thing take 20 minutes. 

What was he liked when he delivered? No comments exchange whatsoever?

Also - I wouldn't read anything into support 'sharing in your paranoia'. They are mostly offshore agents/contractors, who are trained to use a script to 'share your empathy' pretty much no matter what you say. You could tell them you're having a bad day due to coming down with the coronavirus, and they would respond identically. We drivers have to work with the same staff regularly. :)

Incident #2: If he was working a double-stack on DoorDash, you would see addition black dots on the map indicating his other destinations. If there were no such dots, then he was multi-apping and running an order for another platform at the same time as yours. Most drivers aren't very good at doing that efficiently, but as independent contractors, the platforms can't prevent us from doing that. 

1-starring that driver helps the rest of us out there who care enough to at least communicate when there's a delay, and who don't deliver your food 30+ minutes late out of greed.

As more maximizing the compensation - you did the right thing by contacting support first. 

One last question - how much did you tip on each of the orders?"

Well, it turns out the conference was cancelled because of coronavirus concerns and I was really lucky that I bought my flight with miles.

It wouldn’t have been refundable if I had paid cash.  And even if I bought trip insurance, it wouldn’t have covered cancellation caused by epidemics.

Coupled with the current virus that is spreading in our region, this slum is now set to shrink the economy in certain countries.   
I was told I would be laid off - as the business did not see things will pick up any time soon.

However, I don't feel that coronavirus impact is that drastic even though I'm in Asia - it really depends on (the/your) management's strategy and the business plans in the region.

>Newly released data finds the new coronavirus is roughly 20 times deadlier than the seasonal flu.

>The new virus is deadlier than the one that causes the flu.

>An analysis of 44,672 coronavirus patients in China whose diagnoses were confirmed by laboratory testing has found that 1,023 had died by Feb. 11. That’s a fatality rate of 2.3 percent. Figures released on a daily basis suggest the rate has further increased in recent days.

>That is far higher than the mortality rate of the seasonal flu, with which the new coronavirus has sometimes been compared. In the United States, flu fatality rates hover around 0.1 percent.

>The new analysis was posted online by researchers at the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention.

>Over all, about 81 percent of patients with confirmed diagnoses experienced mild illness, the researchers found. Nearly 14 percent had severe cases of COVID-19, the disease caused by the new coronavirus, and about 5 percent had critical illnesses.

>Thirty percent of those who died were in their 60s, 30 percent were in their 70s and 20 percent were age 80 or older. Though men and women were roughly equally represented among the confirmed cases, men made up nearly 64 percent of the deaths. Patients with underlying medical conditions, such as cardiovascular disease or diabetes, died at higher rates.

>The fatality rate among patients in Hubei Province, the center of China’s outbreak, was more than seven times higher than that of other provinces.

>China on Tuesday announced new figures for the outbreak. The number of cases was put at 72,436 — up 1,888 from 70,548 the day before — and the death toll now stands at 1,868, up 98 from 1,770, the authorities said.

They're trying to frame this as though it's new information when it's not. Yes, the cited study is new but the estimated CFR being around 2% has been circulating in mainstream scientific circles for a long time now. At least they're *finally* starting to ditch the idiotic, harmful, ridiculous ""it's just a flu, bro"" narrative. That was maybe my number one pet peeve. Of course, they have not yet made the leap to comparing it to the 1918 Spanish Flu (which is perhaps the most similar disease known to this one, if the initial numbers for COIVD19 are near accurate), but maybe that'll come with time.

Sorry but I'd rather believe the WHO, CDC, local, state, and federal health structures before I believe some for profit PhD quack that thinks we are hiding treatment. I understand your apprehension for trusting the Chinese government and I hope your girlfriend is okay but our governments are not like that. To push videos saying (I only caught a glimpse on my phone before getting on my computer to type this where the videos have now been taken down) we have numerous cases in Buffalo is fear-mongering and really doesn't help decrease the sinophobia some students are feeling (this type of post gives them more reason to 'believe' international students may be infected). 

There was a 911 call a week/two-weeks ago that involved someone that had travelled to China and had, essentially, the sniffles. Someone heard this on the radio and it BLEW UP that there was possible coronavirus yada yada when by the time everyone started tweeting and posting, the patient had already signed off as his roommate called as was 'worried' due to recent travels.

I agree with the other comments that students should not be prejudiced or hateful against Asian students but they completely missed the point of this post which you outlined above. There are no confirmed cases of coronavirus in New York State, including many tested in NYC and to stoke the flames of mass hysteria when official, transparent, and thorough info from a plethora of western government agencies is available is irresponsible and again feels counterintuitive towards the goal of reducing hate and prejudice.

Also dust masks from companies aren't going to help against an airborne coronavirus, the best thing is (*shock*) to follow the CDC guidelines if you are in America at this time.

>While the immediate risk of this new virus to the American public is believed to be low at this time, everyone can do their part to help us respond to this emerging public health threat:
    It’s currently flu and respiratory disease season and CDC recommends getting a flu vaccine, taking everyday preventive actions to help stop the spread of germs, and taking flu antivirals if prescribed.
    If you are a healthcare provider, be on the look-out for people who recently traveled from China and have fever and respiratory symptoms.
    

>If you are a healthcare provider caring for a COVID-19 patient or a public health responder, please take care of yourself and follow recommended infection control procedures.
    If you have been in China or have been exposed to someone sick with COVID-19 in the last 14 days, you will face some limitations on your movement and activity. Please follow instructions during this time. Your cooperation is integral to the ongoing public health response to try to slow spread of this virus. If you develop COVID-19 symptoms, contact your healthcare provider, and tell them about your symptoms and your travel or exposure to a COVID-19 patient.
    For people who are ill with COVID-19, please follow CDC guidance on how to reduce the risk of spreading your illness to others.

I've always appreciated the mask thing. I think it's an incredibly polite thing to do. I considered wearing a mask to PAX if I had a cough this year and discarded the idea for that reason. I'd do it so people don't go, ""Oh, coughing person has Coronavirus."" What would happen instead is, ""Coughing person with mask absolutely has Coronavirus."" Would be pretty self-defeating.

It's one cultural thing I really wish we'd adopt, and not even for the medical benefits (which we could use during flu season). It's really more to do with the fact that fear and embarrassment outweigh people's concern for others. It would be a step towards being considerate of our neighbors in a way that we've completely forgotten how to do."

3. Coronavirus is predicted to be less deadly than the flu, so treat it like a bad flu season, and even then you will probably be over reacting.

The proliferation of guards and barriers everywhere, the ostentatious temperature-checking in public places–all recall the “security theater” that enveloped the US in the aftermath of the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001 (the term was apparently coined by security expert Bruce Schneier, and popularized by James Fallows). Who really knows if all these procedures help, but they make us feel safer, so we have to do them. The historian Maura Cunningham dubbed China’s response to the coronavirus outbreak “quarantine theater“.
Empty streets in Beijing on February 1, 2020

But I feel there is more going on here than the usual human overreaction in the face of crisis. The commands cascading down the chain of the Chinese government, from Xi Jinping’s meetings of the Politburo Standing Committee down to the management of individual city districts and even individual residential compounds, are not simply technical public health measures. They are the product of a mindset that perceives the virus outbreak as a challenge to the power and authority of the Chinese party-state, to which the only appropriate response is to demonstrate that the Chinese party-state indeed has the power and authority to overcome it. As Xi Jinping himself declared, the outbreak is “a major test of China’s system and capacity for governance.”

No global public health expert advised locking down the city of Wuhan, or forbidding people to leave their homes even in other cities with very few cases. Indeed some experts think the whole focus on drastic measures to stop the spread of infection is misguided. So there is clearly an element of theater, of performance for the public, in China’s response, but the theme of this theater is not so much security or health as it is state power. By its overwhelming response and massive disruption of everyday life, the Chinese party-state is showing just how much power it has, and that this power is being used to stop a feared enemy."

>Assessment of the risks posed by severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus (SARS-CoV) on surfaces requires data on survival of this virus on environmental surfaces and on how survival is affected by environmental variables, such as air temperature (AT) and relative humidity (RH). The use of surrogate viruses has the potential to overcome the challenges of working with SARS-CoV and to increase the available data on coronavirus survival on surfaces. Two potential surrogates were evaluated in this study; transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) and mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) were used to determine effects of AT and RH on the survival of coronaviruses on stainless steel. At 4°C, infectious virus persisted for as long as 28 days, and the lowest level of inactivation occurred at 20% RH. Inactivation was more rapid at 20°C than at 4°C at all humidity levels; the viruses persisted for 5 to 28 days, and the slowest inactivation occurred at low RH. Both viruses were inactivated more rapidly at 40°C than at 20°C.

In other words, when it's just above freezing this bug can live up to 28 days, but even at higher temps it's got for 5+.

This is an ""encapsulated"" virus, not a close cousin to the more delicate flu types.  It's not a flu at all in fact..."

Further, if there was a large outbreak in Japan, once the alarm was raised and Japan started testing for the virus, they would have found heaps of cases.

OP was asking about whether 2 months of supplies would be enough. My reply is based on information we're learning about the duration of illness of the virus, the ramping up timeline of epidemic spread and length of time one might expect an outbreak to burn through a population. People have every right to be concerned and ask questions in consideration of a possible pandemic.

I've not panicked once. I don't see OP panicking. In fact, all I do see is increasingly alarmist responses and panicking replies on reddit such as yours shouting down anyone for merely discussing WCS. 

You keep using the term panic but the most panicked sounding replies seem to be from the likes of you. Why is that? Is it projection?

Let me also take issue with your assertion that the human body is able to produce antibodies to fight the virus. With a novel virus this is only possible on the second go round. We have zero natural immunity. And there is no some evidence that a second bout of Coronavirus could be worse for the individual than the first. 

You make very wide and baseless assumptions that, after at most three months of circulation from first case, 70,000 cases (almost certainly much more) and 1000 deaths (again certainly more) and presence in almost 30 countries equals containment. Its not contained. At all.

Further, if people want to get ahead of the curve to ensure their safety should this be a pandemic then they have every right to of they are able. One prepper stocked up and ready to ride out a pandemic is one less person pitching up at the supermarket panic buying at the same time as everyone else. I'd argue that was much more responsible."

This is a good article about ""quarantine theatre"".

https://andrewbatson.com/2020/02/13/the-theater-of-state-power/

The theater of state power

   
This is my second Chinese epidemic. In 2003, I was living in Beijing when the SARS outbreak happened, and in 2020, I was in Heilongjiang province visiting family for the holidays when the coronavirus outbreak went national. As we watched the streets empty and facemasks become obligatory, the sense of SARS deja vu was very strong: here we go again.

As the days went on, and we struggled to make our way across the northeast back to Beijing and back to the US, it became clear that this in fact was not SARS all over again. The government’s response has been much more heavy-handed and extreme: it has locked down cities and closed businesses across the country to stop the spread of a virus that, on all the evidence, is much less dangerous to human life than SARS.

The proliferation of guards and barriers everywhere, the ostentatious temperature-checking in public places–all recall the “security theater” that enveloped the US in the aftermath of the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001 (the term was apparently coined by security expert Bruce Schneier, and popularized by James Fallows). Who really knows if all these procedures help, but they make us feel safer, so we have to do them. The historian Maura Cunningham dubbed China’s response to the coronavirus outbreak “quarantine theater“.
Empty streets in Beijing on February 1, 2020

But I feel there is more going on here than the usual human overreaction in the face of crisis. The commands cascading down the chain of the Chinese government, from Xi Jinping’s meetings of the Politburo Standing Committee down to the management of individual city districts and even individual residential compounds, are not simply technical public health measures. They are the product of a mindset that perceives the virus outbreak as a challenge to the power and authority of the Chinese party-state, to which the only appropriate response is to demonstrate that the Chinese party-state indeed has the power and authority to overcome it. As Xi Jinping himself declared, the outbreak is “a major test of China’s system and capacity for governance.”

No global public health expert advised locking down the city of Wuhan, or forbidding people to leave their homes even in other cities with very few cases. Indeed some experts think the whole focus on drastic measures to stop the spread of infection is misguided. So there is clearly an element of theater, of performance for the public, in China’s response, but the theme of this theater is not so much security or health as it is state power. By its overwhelming response and massive disruption of everyday life, the Chinese party-state is showing just how much power it has, and that this power is being used to stop a feared enemy.

The leaders of the Chinese party-state believes their distinctive version of socialism is superior, and that this superiority consists of an ability to exercise state power more forcefully and effectively than other governments. What then-Premier Wen Jiabao in 2010 called “the incomparable superiority of the socialist system” manifests itself in the Chinese government’s ability to “make decisions efficiently, organize effectively, and concentrate resources to accomplish large undertakings.” (I chose a quote from Wen rather than Xi Jinping to make the point that this kind of thinking is a characteristic of the Chinese leadership as a whole, rather than Xi personally.) Therefore the instinctive response to any challenge to China’s “capacity for governance” is precisely to demonstrate this forcefulness, this effectiveness, this capacity for doing big things.

In my experience at least, many Chinese people do find the theater of state power reassuring rather than threatening. The Western media, which is ideologically predisposed to look for discontent with authoritarian rule, has unsurprisingly emphasized the doubts and worries among the public about the handling of the outbreak. But much of this public discontent in fact reveals how effective the theater of state power actually is. Most of the complaints are about how the promise of all-encompassing and effective state power has failed to be achieved in every instance: the fact that the government has not, for instance, somehow been able to instantaneously supply everyone in the country with facemasks every day.

Fewer people question the premise that the handling of epidemic disease should be an occasion for the overwhelming display of state power. While worries over the economic impact of the unprecedented closures are certainly growing, the central leadership is already painting the most extreme measures as misguided efforts of local officials that will be corrected.
“The coronavirus is not frightening as long as everyone listens to the Party”

Ultimately, I suspect the coronavirus outbreak will go down in official history as another victory for Chinese state power–just as the response to SARS did, or the relief effort for the Wenchuan earthquake in 2008. The outbreak is very likely to burn itself out eventually as rising outside temperatures and humidity decrease the viability of the virus (the same reason that flu season naturally ends in the spring). When that happens, you can be sure that the propaganda machine will give full credit to the efforts of the government.

One thing that the China’s response to the coronavirus outbreak has conclusively demonstrated is that the Chinese state is in fact more powerful, more effective, and more organized than it was in 2003. Its response to this outbreak is more forceful than the response to SARS because, in part, it can be.

I feel like this increase in state power should be a bigger part of the standard narrative of how China has changed over the past two decades than it now is. (In this regard I must recommend Xu Jilin’s brilliant 2011 essay “The Specter of Leviathan: A Critique of Chinese Statism since 2000” as an indispensable piece of intellectual history; it is available to English readers thanks to David Ownby’s translation in Rethinking China’s Rise: A Liberal Critique). What it not yet so clear is whether the Chinese state is getting better at deploying that power in service of the public interest."

He required supplemental oxygen.

He began feeling ill on Jan. 15, was admitted to the hospital on Jan. 20th, and was released from the hospital Feb. 3rd/4.

https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2001191

On January 19, 2020, a 35-year-old man presented to an urgent care clinic in Snohomish County, Washington, with a 4-day history of cough and subjective fever. On checking into the clinic, the patient put on a mask in the waiting room. After waiting approximately 20 minutes, he was taken into an examination room and underwent evaluation by a provider. He disclosed that he had returned to Washington State on January 15 after traveling to visit family in Wuhan, China. The patient stated that he had seen a health alert from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) about the novel coronavirus outbreak in China and, because of his symptoms and recent travel, decided to see a health care provider....

Given the patient’s travel history, the local and state health departments were immediately notified. Together with the urgent care clinician, the Washington Department of Health notified the CDC Emergency Operations Center. Although the patient reported that he had not spent time at the Huanan seafood market and reported no known contact with ill persons during his travel to China, CDC staff concurred with the need to test the patient for 2019-nCoV on the basis of current CDC “persons under investigation” case definitions.8 Specimens were collected in accordance with CDC guidance and included serum and nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swab specimens. After specimen collection, the patient was discharged to home isolation with active monitoring by the local health department.
On January 20, 2020, the CDC confirmed that the patient’s nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabs tested positive for 2019-nCoV by real-time reverse-transcriptase–polymerase-chain-reaction (rRT-PCR) assay. In coordination with CDC subject-matter experts, state and local health officials, emergency medical services, and hospital leadership and staff, the patient was admitted to an airborne-isolation unit at Providence Regional Medical Center for clinical observation, with health care workers following CDC recommendations for contact, droplet, and airborne precautions with eye protection.

On admission, the patient reported persistent dry cough and a 2-day history of nausea and vomiting; he reported that he had no shortness of breath or chest pain. Vital signs were within normal ranges. On physical examination, the patient was found to have dry mucous membranes. The remainder of the examination was generally unremarkable. After admission, the patient received supportive care, including 2 liters of normal saline and ondansetron for nausea.


On days 2 through 5 of hospitalization (days 6 through 9 of illness), the patient’s vital signs remained largely stable, apart from the development of intermittent fevers accompanied by periods of tachycardia (Figure 2). The patient continued to report a nonproductive cough and appeared fatigued. On the afternoon of hospital day 2, the patient passed a loose bowel movement and reported abdominal discomfort. A second episode of loose stool was reported overnight; a sample of this stool was collected for rRT-PCR testing, along with additional respiratory specimens (nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal) and serum. The stool and both respiratory specimens later tested positive by rRT-PCR for 2019-nCoV, whereas the serum remained negative.

Treatment during this time was largely supportive. For symptom management, the patient received, as needed, antipyretic therapy consisting of 650 mg of acetaminophen every 4 hours and 600 mg of ibuprofen every 6 hours. He also received 600 mg of guaifenesin for his continued cough and approximately 6 liters of normal saline over the first 6 days of hospitalization.


A chest radiograph taken on hospital day 3 (illness day 7) was reported as showing no evidence of infiltrates or abnormalities (Figure 3). However, a second chest radiograph from the night of hospital day 5 (illness day 9) showed evidence of pneumonia in the lower lobe of the left lung (Figure 4). These radiographic findings coincided with a change in respiratory status starting on the evening of hospital day 5, when the patient’s oxygen saturation values as measured by pulse oximetry dropped to as low as 90% while he was breathing ambient air. On day 6, the patient was started on supplemental oxygen, delivered by nasal cannula at 2 liters per minute. Given the changing clinical presentation and concern about hospital-acquired pneumonia, treatment with vancomycin (a 1750-mg loading dose followed by 1 g administered intravenously every 8 hours) and cefepime (administered intravenously every 8 hours) was initiated.


On hospital day 6 (illness day 10), a fourth chest radiograph showed basilar streaky opacities in both lungs, a finding consistent with atypical pneumonia (Figure 5), and rales were noted in both lungs on auscultation. Given the radiographic findings, the decision to administer oxygen supplementation, the patient’s ongoing fevers, the persistent positive 2019-nCoV RNA at multiple sites, and published reports of the development of severe pneumonia3,4 at a period consistent with the development of radiographic pneumonia in this patient, clinicians pursued compassionate use of an investigational antiviral therapy. Treatment with intravenous remdesivir (a novel nucleotide analogue prodrug in development10,11) was initiated on the evening of day 7, and no adverse events were observed in association with the infusion. Vancomycin was discontinued on the evening of day 7, and cefepime was discontinued on the following day, after serial negative procalcitonin levels and negative nasal PCR testing for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus.

On hospital day 8 (illness day 12), the patient’s clinical condition improved. Supplemental oxygen was discontinued, and his oxygen saturation values improved to 94 to 96% while he was breathing ambient air. The previous bilateral lower-lobe rales were no longer present. His appetite improved, and he was asymptomatic aside from intermittent dry cough and rhinorrhea. 

As of January 30, 2020, the patient remains hospitalized. He is afebrile, and all symptoms have resolved with the exception of his cough, which is decreasing in severity.

*Seems like Eth2 is quite close, right? During these two weeks, Eth2 teams were working assiduously, making significant progress with current development.Eth2 Implementers call took place as well as Eth2 AMA. The part that’s gained the most attention is a discussion of the beacon chain launch timing: maybe July; very strong confidence that it will be this year. “Validated, staking on Eth2: #2 — Two ghosts in a trench coat” by Carl Beekhuizen was published last week. In this installment, he discusses the consensus mechanisms behind Eth2. Eth2 has a novel approach to deciding which block is the head of the chain, along with which blocks are and are not a part of the chain. By using a hybrid between the two mechanisms, Eth2 aims to have a consensus which, in addition to being rapid and safe when the network is behaving normally, remains safe even when it’s being attacked. A must-read! Jim McDonald published some suggestions for network health metrics for Eth2. “Ethereum 2: A Validator’s Journey Through the Beacon Chain” by Alex Tudorache of Alethio is out.

No matter if you have Lysol and wipes with you, there still could be fecal matter and particles in the toilets that you can’t clean yourself. The best you could do is bring solution to pour into the toilets and have a toilet brush to clean the toilet, which is not practical. Even then, if there is no lid, when you flush the toilet, the urine and excrement particles get thrust into the air and float around, which is easily inhaled or can get into your body via transfer. So I’m not sure how effective cleaning the toilet is against this. The toilet can even be flushed multiple times and still spread particles. It’s called toilet plume. So close the toilet lid when you flush if there is one, regardless if there is a pandemic or not.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toilet_plume

https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4692156/

This states that there is indirect evidence that pathogens like norovirus and SARS virus could be spread by toilet aerosol, but more studies are needed. Both links specifically mention SARS coronavirus.

The second link is about toilet plume and infectious disease transmission. Here are some quotes:

“The studies demonstrate that potentially infectious aerosols may be produced in substantial quantities during flushing. Aerosolization can continue through multiple flushes to expose subsequent toilet users. Some of the aerosols desiccate to become droplet nuclei and remain adrift in the air currents. However, no studies have yet clearly demonstrated or refuted toilet plume-related disease transmission, and the significance of the risk remains largely uncharacterized.”

“Research suggests that toilet plume could play a contributory role in the transmission of infectious diseases. Additional research in multiple areas is warranted to assess the risks posed by toilet plume, especially within health care facilities.”

“A critical determinant of the infection risk posed by a deposited pathogen will be the organism’s ability to survive on a surface. Many pathogens, including Shigella, E coli, C difficile, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus, and norovirus can survive on surfaces for weeks or even months. These pathogens can also be present in vomit or stools of infected persons.”"

In more recent history, dynastic change of hands were not exactly done peacefully, but less death of commoners.  I agree the shift in Chinese power will come from in-fighting between regional governments.  You saw some of that with Xi Jinping and Bo Xilai.  Although, much of the CCP are Xi loyalists or are at least silenced, it doesn't mean there won't be a future faction.  I would find it hard to see an idealistic revolution of a battle between the 'right' and 'wrong', but there still needs to be some manner of 'moralistic' rationale as to why the existing government is not good enough.  This is why the CCP is so much more sensitive to HK, Taiwan and Xinjiang than to the Coronavirus.  Regional separatism has always been issues for China.  In fact, I would say the CCP has only two goals, 1) maintain one China and 2) promote economic growth."

Like it shouldn't be controversial to say it's near impossible to gauge fatality rates this early on with a virus that spreads this fast.  What we should all acknowledge is that using ""total deaths/total known cases"" with a rapidly expanding epidemic is very very bad logic.

Fwiw 18% isn't like a crazy number.  SARS was around 10% but MERS was as high as 35%.  While not a coronavirus per se obviously there are other upper respiratory ailemts with similarly high fatality rates such as Spanish Flu and Swine Flu.

HONG KONG — HSBC plans to cut 35,000 jobs over the next three years as the global bank struggles to revive a business that has come to depend increasingly on China for growth.

The London-based bank said on Tuesday that it aimed to cut $4.5 billion in costs as it faces headwinds that include the coronavirus outbreak in China and months of political strife in Hong Kong, one of its most important bases.

The coronavirus is causing economic disruptions in Hong Kong and mainland China that could have a negative impact on performance this year, the bank warned. The bank lowered expectations for growth across Asia for this year but added that it expected to see some improvement once the virus was contained. Nearly half of the bank's revenue comes from Asia.

HSBC shares trading in Hong Kong slumped by more than 3 percent.

It is the latest company to shed light on the impact of a fast-moving virus that has gripped China over recent weeks and led to a near nationwide economic standstill. While parts of the country are getting back to work, the reopening of business operations for many companies has been slow."

https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/18/opinion/coronavirus-china-numbers.html?referringSource=articleShare

“As of Tuesday, the case fatality rate of COVID-19 appeared to be about 2.5 percent. That’s in keeping with what it was, for example, from the beginning of the outbreak up to Jan. 28. By comparison, the case fatality rate for the seasonal flu in the United States ranges between 0.10 percent and 0.18 percent. For SARS, it’s about 10 percent and for MERS, about 35 percent. For Ebola, it has varied between 25 percent and 90 percent, depending on outbreaks, averaging approximately 50 percent.

And so based on what we know so far, COVID-19 seems to be much less fatal than other coronavirus infections and diseases that turned into major epidemics in recent decades. The operative words here are “based on what we know so far” — meaning, both no more and no less than that, and also that our take on the situation might need to change as more data come in.”"

> SINGAPORE - Facebook has blocked access to a page on its platform that has been publishing falsehoods on various issues in Singapore, including the coronavirus outbreak, but not without registering its protest.

> The social media giant on Tuesday (Feb 18) disabled access to the States Times Review (STR) Facebook page, making it unavailable to users in Singapore after it was required to do so under the Protection from Online Falsehoods and Manipulation Act (Pofma).

> Commenting on the move, Minister for Communications and Information S. Iswaran said it was especially important to stop the spread of falsehoods as Singapore battles the coronavirus disease, known as Covid-19.

> ""The reason why we need to act swiftly is because if we don't, then these falsehoods can cause anxiety, fear and even panic,"" he told reporters yesterday at an event held by the Hindu Endowments Board to discuss precautionary measures against the coronavirus.

> The STR Facebook page, owned by Singaporean Alex Tan Zhi Xiang, has received three correction directions under the fake news law since last November. Two had to do with the virus outbreak.

> After Mr Tan ignored all three directions, the STR page was designated a declared online site (DOS) on Saturday and barred from receiving any financial benefit, among other things.

> Despite this, he did not comply with the rules under Pofma, and the authorities then issued an order for Facebook to disable access to the page for Singapore users.

> On Tuesday, a Facebook spokesman told The Straits Times the company had conducted a careful review and determined that it was legally compelled to restrict access to the page under Singapore's laws.

> But she criticised the order for being disproportionate, and said it contradicted the Government's claim that Pofma would not be used as a censorship tool.

> She added: ""We've repeatedly highlighted this law's potential for overreach and we're deeply concerned about the precedent this sets for the stifling of freedom of expression in Singapore.""

> Under Pofma, online sites can be designated as a DOL after they receive three corrections directions within six months.

> Related Story Facebook ordered to disable access to States Times Review Facebook page for Singapore users

> In the case of the STR page, the Ministry of Communications and Information had noted that it ""has repeatedly conveyed numerous falsehoods"".

> The erroneous claims that the page was issued corrections directions for included statements that Singapore has not been able to trace the source infections in any of the coronavirus cases, and that the country had run out of masks.

> Emphasising the importance of ensuring that Singaporeans get the right information during a public health threat, Mr Iswaran said STR's actions and those of others who have perpetuated falsehoods during this period could cause anxiety, fear and even panic.

> ""We want to avoid that because that is not only (unhelpful) to our overall effort, it is actually going to be harmful,"" he said, describing the battle against the coronavirus as both a healthcare and psychological challenge.

> ""On the psychological side, it is essential that... we put out timely information, accurate information, so that our citizens are well informed and understand what is happening.""

> Noting that some people have exploited the situation to purvey falsehoods, he said it was critical to shut down such lies swiftly.

> In most of the five cases to do with the coronavirus outbreak so far, those who have received the correction directions have complied. Only Mr Tan had ignored them, he added.

> The Government had to issue a further direction under Section 34 of Pofma to disable access to the page for Singapore users after Mr Tan failed to put up a warning as required when it was declared a DOL, Mr Iswaran said.

Here I go snark alert.....

People- stop talking about “human life more important than economical loss”.   They are one and the same!   If you have global economic collapse, al hell of a lot more people will die and not from this virus!

The world has to balance those two things, and it is never easy.  This is not a black and white world in which we live.   How easy to say, life over profits.   I get it.  That just is not reality.

Imagine when ALL trade stops.   Imagine when companies go bankrupt.  People lose jobs.  Trade stops.    Food shortages, long and wide spread power outages, no gas, no medicine.   YOu think that is more survivable than a virus?  People would become the virus.   Everyone in your community would be a virus.   THAT is what is trying to be prevented so when they try to put some limits on travel and encourage people to be aware and take precautions, it is the best that can be done.   If an actual outbreak occurs, contaiment.  If containment fails, other measures /mitigation would occur.  If that fails, it is REALLY the end of the world as we know it and you aren’t going to die from the Coronavirus.   You will die from your neighbor who wants your pills, food, water, shelter.   Harsh, true.   

Really let it sink in and I hope you don’t repeat the naive  mantra of goverments over people again.  (I have said it too in the past, but once you see it you see it)"

There is an awful lot in this article, but I highly recommend reading it as it does come at the virus story from many angles and it is an interesting piece written by a US vet and blogger living in China. A small sample of the kind of observations he has made in the article:

>300 US military personnel arrived in Wuhan for the Military World Games on October 19.

>The first coronavirus case appeared two weeks later, on November 2.

>Keep in mind that the Coronavirus incubation period is 14 days. So, fourteen days later…

There is a handy table of contents at the beginning of the article:

>Was the 2020 Wuhan Coronavirus an Engineered Biological Attack on China by America for Geopolitical Advantage?

>Introduction

>Swine flu was propagated by drones

>Trump trade war went “hot”

They have a tendency to toot their own horn to make themselves look better.

Cue the irony about calling out SK on contradicting reports when you do the same.

From what I've seen, SK donated 3M masks, 100k hazmat suits, 100k googles.

The ones who do usually aren't afraid to express it (I was told earlier this week that people like me shouldn't be allowed to live here, and some nasty stuff about coronavirus two weeks back.)

From my experience people who have negative things to say about Muslims, Africans, Americans, and Gypsies (I'm including religion and nationality in the general ""racist"" category) are much more common, but at the same time happy to express those views amongst one another.

Das ist ähnlich wie bei Antivaxxern, die eine Gefahr der Krankheiten für sich als so gering einschätzen, dass sie sich nicht impfen, dabei aber übersehen, dass sie den Herdenschutz auch für die Leute gefährden, die aus unterschiedlichen Gründen nicht in der Lage sind, sich für eine Impfung zu entscheiden.

Wenn du dich davon angegriffen fühlst und das komplett anders gemeint hast, ist das natürlich möglich, aber so kam dein Beitrag bei mir an.

Was genau sollen mir jetzt eigentlich die Influenza-Toten sagen? Die bisherige berechnete Todesrate des Coronavirus ist höher, bei 2,3 Prozent gegenüber 2,7 Promille gegenüber der Grippe 2017/2018, die noch eine der gefährlichen Grippenversionen war. Die Ansteckungsrate ist, so weit bestimmbar, beim Coronavirus mit 2,5-3 Menschen fast doppelt so hoch wie bei der Grippe mit 1,4 Menschen. Und wir haben keinerlei Impfung, um gefährdete Personen so schützen. Entsprechend ist es nicht dumm, sich ein paar Gedanken zu machen, auch wenn man selbst wahrscheinlich nach ein paar elenden Tagen wieder vollkommen fit ist. Ich würde mich ausreichend bescheiden fühlen, wenn ich irgendwelche Verwandte anstecken würde, die dann daran sterben, egal wie unwahrscheinlich das ist."

In 1976, an outbreak of the swine flu, Influenza A virus subtype H1N1 at Fort Dix, New Jersey caused one death, hospitalized 13, and led to a mass immunization program. After the program began, the vaccine was associated with an increase in reports of Guillain-Barré Syndrome, which can cause paralysis, respiratory arrest, and death. The immunization program was ended after approximately 25% of the population of the United States had been administered the vaccine.

Richard Krause, Director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases from 1975 to 1984, writes that the government response to the swine flu outbreak was considered to be too fast and the response to the AIDS epidemic too slow.

>For example, the supposedly new coronavirus in China. For example, Ebola. For example, HIV. For example, the coronavirus supposedly causing SARS (2003). How do researchers know these viruses exist?

>“Well, of course they know. They must.”

>That is not a satisfactory answer—even though most people would offer it.

>The question can become very interesting, when you stop and consider researchers working away in biowarfare labs fiddling with viruses. How do they know they’re tweaking viruses that actually exist?

>On a more mundane frontier, when scientists tell us they’re rushing to develop a vaccine against a virus that is harming the population, how do they know that virus exists to begin with?

>I came to this question when I was researching HIV in 1987. I began to think about it seriously in 1990. During all these years, I’ve reached out to independent researchers, and I’ve tried to stitch together their answers. I can’t say it’s been a smooth trip.

>But I have found some answers; and I have certainly found some fake mainstream assertions, which glitter like baubles on plastic branches of 99-cent store Xmas trees.

>Here are a few clues. You need to take a tissue sample from a live human being. You need to filter that sample correctly so you arrive at a much smaller sample you believe might contain a virus. You need to put a drop of that sample under an electron microscope and observe what looks like a virus.

>How much virus? How many identical particles of virus? Opinions differ on this. It could be one definite virus, one particle. It could be many, many identical particles.

>Sidebar: If you’re trying to prove this virus is actually causing DISEASE in a person, you have to go further. You have to show the very same virus is active and replicating at a very high rate in the person’s body, and his immune system isn’t defeating it. Beyond noticing the patient is sick, how do you test for all THAT? I’m still looking for a definitive technical answer—if there is one.

>All right, let’s’ get back to the electron microscope. Let’s say you’ve observed many identical particles of what looks like a virus in the electron microscope photograph, called an EM. You can then say, “Found it.” But you need to be sure. You need to figure out that this virus isn’t just something that ordinarily lives in the human body like a couch potato and does nothing—a passive endogenous virus. No. You want to show this virus comes from the outside as an invader—an exogenous virus. And how do you perfectly make that differentiation every time? Another question that might have no precise formula as an answer.

>Big question: CAN WE BE SURE ALL VIRUSES THAT ARE SAID TO EXIST AND SAID TO CAUSE EPIDEMICS ARE ACTUALLY FOUND AND OBSERVED AND IDENTIFIED ON ELECTRON MICROSCOPE PHOTOGRAPHS? CAN WE AT LEAST SAY THAT?

>No.

>In which case, the researchers have been, at least some of the time, up the creek without a paddle. They’ve jumped the gun. They’ve bolted out of the starting gate too soon. They’ve laid their money down on a horse that may not even be in the race. They’ve written a check no one can cash. They’re talking about lockdowns and quarantines without having proved their favorite virus of the moment exists. Sure, people on the back end will make big money from these unwarranted presumptions, but money is not science. It might control science, but it ISN’T science.

>All right. I’ve now set the stage for an excerpt from an interview, a profound interview with a late mainstream master who, in the face of fake science, suddenly was characterized as a rebel, Etienne De Harven. 

>The interview was conducted several years ago by the brilliant reporter, Celia Farber. You can find the whole interview [here](https://www.thetruthbarrier.com/2013/06/20/can-electron-microscopy-resolve-the-hiv-battle-an-exclusive-interview-with-em-pioneer-dr-etienne-de-harven/). 

>I strongly suggest you read it sixteen times. Yes, it gets technical. You’ll also notice names of elite scientists you haven’t run across. Learn the meaning of the words you’ve never seen before. Dig in. This isn’t television-type brush-off conversation. This isn’t a YouTube throwaway.

>I have another reason for exposing readers to this interview—it’s what a conversation about serious scientific issues looks like…this is what trying to bridge the gap between researchers, honest reporters, and the public looks like. There should be hundreds and thousands of such print-interviews taking place, laid before readers. They can handle it. Dumbing down people is partly an illusion: they can wake up. They WILL wake up if they’re sufficiently interested.

>Etienne De Harven’s background: president of the Electron Microscopy Society of America; researcher, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center; Cornell professor of cell biology; professor of pathology, University of Toronto; recognized pioneer in the field of electron microscopy.

>The interview focuses on HIV; whether it was ever found and isolated. The implications and questions spread out to any and all viruses."

I’m going to assume this is out of ignorance instead of malfeasance, so I’ll just say that you’re wrong rather than you’re lying. 

Bloomberg has stents our in because of blocked artery. It’s a common condition due to cholesterol, smoking or just genetics. The stents are put in as a precautionary matter. It has pretty much no impact once the artery is cleared. 

Now, I don’t expect you to know any of that. But you do know what a heart attack is, yes? A heart attack is an emergency that easily can kill you, require immediate attention and will impact your life after.

The short answer is that we've probably done a lot more to trace and quarantine cases, and because of a relatively higher level of mutual trust between the authorities and the people, more people are willing to come forward and be LOA'd/quarantined/go for treatment. 

So while there are more cases, it's only because we've actually gone looking for and come forward with those cases.

Pathological findings of COVID-19 associated with acute respiratory distress syndrome 

Since   late   December,   2019,   an   outbreak   of   a   novel   coronavirus   disease   (COVID-19;   previously   known   as   2019-nCoV)1,2   was   reported   in   Wuhan,   China,2   which   has  subsequently  affected  26  countries  worldwide.  In  general, COVID-19 is an acute resolved disease but it can also be deadly, with a 2% case fatality rate. Severe disease onset  might  result  in  death  due  to  massive  alveolar  damage and progressive respiratory failure.2,3 As of Feb 15, about   66   580   cases   have   been   confirmed   and   over   1524  deaths.  However,  no  pathology  has  been  reported  due  to  barely  accessible  autopsy  or  biopsy.2,3  Here,  we  investigated  the  pathological  characteristics  of  a  patient  who   died   from   severe   infection   with   severe   acute   respiratory   syndrome   coronavirus   2   (SARS-CoV-2)   by   obtaining  biopsy  samples  at  autopsy.  This  study  is  in  accordance with regulations issued by the National Health Commission of China and the Helsinki Declaration.Our findings will facilitate understanding of the pathogenesis of   COVID-19   and   improve   clinical   strategies   against   the disease"

Wake up people! Worrying isn't gonna do anything but I've already left LA and got around ten thousand in food water medicine and guns. Some things to consider if you seriously think it's nothing.

China, the largest country on the earth and the second largest economy is as of this moment completely shut down. Consider the implications down the line when the factories are shut down and the cargo ships stop coming in

The novel Coronavirus is MORE contagious than the flu

14% of people (so far) have died from their illness. (22% in Wuhan where their hospitals were/are overrun)

A perfectly healthy 35 year old doctor died in the hospital from this disease. Another perfectly healthy 34? Year old in Washington presented with mild symptoms. A week later he was in the verge of death and had severe viral pneumonia. He was saved by an experimental anti-viral

Even after recovery it is likely COVID will leave you with permanent damage in the lungs, kidneys, and possibly even your reproductive organs. This was observed in SARS

Finally, and most worrisome imo, as a newly discovered virus we don't have any concrete data to draw or conclusions. There is a possibility this virus behaves like HPV in that you never develop an immunity to it, if you survive the first wave it may come back in flare ups in times of weakness or stress. It may behave like influenza where it returns slightly mutated every year. We don't know but not paying attention doesn't help anyone and the fact is anyone who's paying attention understands this could be unprecedented in it's impact on human civilization.

I invite you all to educate yourselves ave draw your own conclusions. Read and re-read. Practice skepticism and critical thinking. Ask ""who wrote this ave why? What do they want me to learn from reading this"" look for primary sources. Medical journals, peer reviewed studies, and eye witness testimony is worth more than a news article. Understand the USA is preoccupied with protecting ""American interests"" that does not necessarily equate with American lives. It closer approximates the American economy, American wealth. Understand that the government has an obligation to protect the market and the money MORE so than protecting individual lives. THATS why everything is still business as usual. If they told you the truth, ""there's a deadly pandemic coming our way"" no one would be at work right now and the economy would crash. American interests would be put in jeopardy. The truth is out there, readily available, you just have to poke around. Don't believe anything I said, search around yourself do your due diligence and seek the truth."

Because if you're going to claim someone's lying then you should probably know what the correct numbers are? For instance if you told me the sky is yellow, I know you're full of shit because the sky is actually blue, because I've seen it outside. If you're not an expert, then perhaps you shouldn't be commenting on these numbers.

>  I can only go off of what is being released..and when they are only releasing data that makes no sense(ie the I only have 2-3000 test kits to test for virus, thus we can only say 2-3000 cases each day)? **look at the recovery rate of wuhan vs the recovery rate of everywhere else in china....look at the death rate of wuhan vs everywhere else in china...you are not goin got see matching data**....again, no way anyone can really know what is going on until number outside of china are released....the real infection numbers? who knows...the real death rate? who knows....

What's not matching? There are logical and scientific reasons why the death rate in Wuhan and Hubei may be higher. The city is completely overwhelmed with cases and people have shown videos and pictures of what it's like in the hospitals. Wuhan has had 44k confirmed cases already. Compare that with Shanghai, a city twice its size with only ~300 cases so far. It's not hard to guess which city's hospitals are overwhelmed. I can tell you that you'll probably get better care in a city with only 300 cases so far.

>This new coronavirus has resulted in thousands of cases of lethal disease in China, with additional patients being identified in a rapidly growing number internationally. 2019-nCov was reported to share the same receptor, Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), with SARS-Cov. Here based on the public database and the state-of-the-art single-cell RNA-Seq technique, we analyzed the ACE2 RNA expression profile in the normal human lungs. The result indicates that the ACE2 virus receptor expression is concentrated in a small population of type II alveolar cells (AT2). Surprisingly, we found that this population of ACE2-expressing AT2 also highly expressed many other genes that positively regulating viral reproduction and transmission. **A comparison between eight individual samples demonstrated that the Asian male one has an extremely large number of ACE2-expressing cells in the lung.**

So generally, Asian Male Smokers will be the most impacted.

If he were a fascist, you wouldn't be able to dog him 24/7/365. Because real fascists would kill people like you. And the media.

Luckily, we live in America, and he's only president, not a king or dictator. Luckily, he is term limited, and after the next 4 years, no more Trump. Then someone else can have their turn, which I cant wait to see who tries.

The truth of the matter is that the democratic party has no leg to stand on, politically. And the Republican party is weak. That's okay. Parties live, and parties die. And new parties are made from their ashes. History repeats.

Because someone says ""lol liberal"", that's equivalent to ""ok boomer"". It's just a meme. Do I believe you're a liberal? Nah. I dont care what you are. Am I fascist? Nah. A little nihilistic. Sympathetic towards most humans but able to see that most humans, on average, are dumb? Yeah.

You tell me to stop living a sad life, but really, I like my life. I rarely engage in social media. Go look me up.

Aside from that, it’s core properties are for all intents & purposes the same as any other, in other words, it is likely to have the same life on surfaces. 

Yes I agree that most of our assumptions on this specific coronavirus are based on studies of its former counterparts, I had seen a peer-reviewed med journal on wuflu which indicates a lifespan of 12 days in a non-host but optimal environment but lacking a link to the source nor the motivation to spent a half hour trawling the web to find it means I didn’t -really- want to mention it, but since you insist. 

Meanwhile, some veterinarian coronaviruses are recorded to live for up to 29 days outside of a host. As this is a novel coronavirus, it could well have evolved from such virulent predecessors.

As for the 😂😂...  the structure & components of this virus are immensely different from influenza & anyone who brings it up as a comparison is a complete idiot. Meanwhile all viruses spread largely in the same way, direct person to person, your comment of how it’s ‘proven’ to do so demonstrates your lack of actual knowledge in the field. 

Indeed I lean more towards the panic than the ‘carry on’ fellows such as yourself . It’s called being precautious, I would understand your comparison of myself to the fear-mongers if I actually made comments urging such kinds of fear, sadly I did not. So before you go right ahead and try to strip someone’s comments down be sure to check they’re worthy of your bullshit prejudice kthx 

Could your possibly explain how the hell me advising people that this virus could have a 1-2 week hostless survival be inducing panic? That’s dumb. You’re dumb. The worst case scenario of someone panicking over my comment would be that they disinfect all new things they come across. Can you explain how the hell someone taking basic disinfection steps as is already advised could possibly be inducing panic. Get a grip you shill."

Because anyone with a cold or flu would automatically think it is the coronavirus and we would see a collapse of hospitals.  There would also be more cross infections by those who have it with people who are immunocompromised with the flu or cold. Look at Wuhan when the coronavirus was announced... the hospitals were flooded and the hospital system basically collapsed.  The doctors and nurses became infected and began infecting patients that did not have it.

As I said before, I support free speech, but don't think in the current political climate that it's feesible for reasons I've already explained.

I never disrespected Confucius. Confucius values of piety and harmony actually support the cultural power distance and complacency that has muddied China's overall attitude toward censorship. If you spent time there you might start to gather a sense of that. Not witholding, I had my own frustration when I first arrived to find that people were so indifferent toward access to uninhibited media on the internet. You talk about Confucian values, but can you even fathom what 'harmony' means in an imperfect world?

I'm curious to see when the coronavirus scare blows over how many people will be sending pleas to overthrow the evil regime versus how many will sink back into the status quo. If systemic change is going to happen, it's going to take a lot more than people being shut in and feeling shitty while a virus ravenges their population. And it's going to need a leader.

Saturday February 8, 2020 10:12 am PST by [Juli Clover](https://www.macrumors.com/author/juli-clover/)Foxconn was originally planning to reopen its factories on Monday to begin production on Apple devices after the Lunar New Year holiday, but the company's plans were denied by Chinese Authorities due to the ongoing coronavirus outbreak, reports [*Nikkei*](https://asia.nikkei.com/Spotlight/Coronavirus-outbreak/China-blocks-restart-of-Foxconn-plants-due-to-coronavirus-sources).   


Public health experts told Foxconn that its Shenzhen factories face ""high risks of coronavirus infection"" after on-site inspections were conducted, with the information relayed to *Nikkei*through multiple sources.

Our economy is booming, people have jobs and are generally doing well, and yet we have been bludgeoned over the head for three years with the idea that our country is in DANGER from a very DANGEROUS man, and the country won’t SURVIVE his election...well, we did survive, so now we REALLY won’t survive his RE-election, in fact, it is SO dangerous that we CANNOT leave this decision up to voters...something like the way they couldn’t leave the nominee up to the voters in 2016...
Put it this way. Either the democrats are deliberate tools of Putin, or they have done his work out of sheer stupidity. Because I’d be willing to bet if you have Putin a choice between a win for Trump in 2016, OR a relentless campaign to delegitimize an election, undermine a Presidency, and shake American’s faith in the integrity of their elections- I’m pretty sure he would have been happier about the second part. Courtesy of every democrat out there.

The sad thing is, I am pretty sure- not 100%, but maybe 90% sure that Nancy Pelosi, the DNC, and every democrat running is actively wishing bad, bad things on America right now. Like, if the Coronavirus turns out to be a really big problem, and the markets tank, and hospitals are overrun...I just kind of feel like they would be a little happy? Like, Oh, good, now he can’t run in a strong economy and it will make universal health care an easier sell with people panicking!

See, I don’t like to be so cynical and mistrusting, but watching the deteriorate in relations and general civility over the last three years, I don’t get the feeling that the democrats are rooting for US."

We’re a family of four and we’ve had several colds already this season, plus one horrible bout of adenovirus before Christmas, and my 3 year old and I got viral pneumonia in September. Every cough and sniffle you hear is almost certainly not the coronavirus and if you treated it as such you’d be obliterating resources left and right and exponentially increasing the risk of people catching other serious respiratory infections in hospitals and clinics. 

Testing representative samples of pneumonia cases in multiple cities is a good way of getting some clarity on whether it’s endemic or not yet. Quarantining your office is not."

https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/coronavirus-cases/

I would say the fact the cases of new cases in China are seeming to have started a non-exponential increase, may point to the success of Chinese mass quarantine. 

Also there now is data on the age groups of the dead: 

The usual suspects. Old and pre-existing conditions. 

Front the analysis of death cases, it emerged that the demographic profile was mainly male, accounting for 2/3, females accounting for 1/3, and is mainly elderly, more than 80% are elderly over 60 years old, and more than 75% had underlying diseases present such as cardiovascular and cardiovascular diseases, diabetes and, in some cases, tumor.
Elderly people with basic diseases, as long as they have pneumonia, were clinically a high-risk factor regardless of whether it is a coronavirus or not, and the case fatality rate was also very high, so it is not that the case fatality rate of pneumonia is high because of the infection with the new coronavirus. ""This point must be explained to everyone,"" concluded the NHC official.[7]


The only negative is that deaths are remaking to look like an exponential, but considering they are old, it makes sense.

War is at an all time low. Theft, murder, rape, and violent crime in general have been falling for decades.

The Coronavirus sucks but it only seems to have a 12% fatality rate, and that's without good medical care. With medical care that number goes down to less than 2%. You want a real scary disease, try Polio, which has no cure, and cripples you for the rest of your life if you do survive. 

The Trade War sucks but at least we're not living under the constant threat of nuclear war.

We are the closest we've ever been to the world of Star Trek than ever before. We could end world hunger TOMORROW if the powers that be wanted too. It's no longer an issue of resources, but one of logistics and corporate interests. 

The world of Star Trek was never perfect, but it was something worth aspiring too. But now it's all doom and gloom because some hipster neckbeards decided to get a twitter account after reading mein kamf? 

Star Trek is now being written by sheltered shallow hollywood people who have never experienced injustice in their lives beyond that time the starbucks barista didn't put enough cream in their mocha latte.

It has led to a  dangerous bubble that is about to  burst.  When that happens, it means we  have lost the trade war, and  Trump would have to peel back his tariffs  and let China dictate the terms of the trade agreement.  Because of his  pride, Trump absolutely  will never ever do that, so he used the coronavirus to cripple their  economy.

Our economy appears  prosperous, with low unemployment and record high stock  market, but  that's only because of the sheer amount of money we've been  pumping  into our economy to artificially prop it up.  We're trying to bluff  China into thinking the trade war isn't hurting us so that they'll  back  down.  We're a poker player trying to get them to fold.  The  problem is, China called our bluff.

If it's early and you're one of the 20 percent who need to be hospitalized, they will have room for you.  If it's in the middle of the pandemic, the hospitals will be full and you will only have home care.  If it's late and you have to go to the hospital, the crowd will have come and gone.

They’ve only ran 25 tests in that state and there are zero pending tests which means they aren’t even testing possible cases? Makes no sense unless it’s lack of testing. I can’t imagine with numbers rising even moderately in some countries outside of China that the USA wouldn’t just test their possible cases if they had the resources to easily do so.

A: There is still a lot that is unknown about the newly emerged COVID-19 and how it spreads. Two other coronaviruses have emerged previously to cause severe illness in people (MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV). The virus that causes COVID-19 is more genetically related to SARS-CoV than MERS-CoV, but both are betacoronaviruses with their origins in bats. While we don’t know for sure that this virus will behave the same way as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, we can use the information gained from both of these earlier coronaviruses to guide us. In general, because of poor survivability of these coronaviruses on surfaces, there is likely very low risk of spread from products or packaging that are shipped over a period of days or weeks at ambient temperatures. Coronaviruses are generally thought to be spread most often by respiratory droplets. Currently there is no evidence to support transmission of COVID-19 associated with imported goods and there have not been any cases of COVID-19 in the United States associated with imported goods. Information will be provided on the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) website as it becomes available.

Endangerment is a type of crime involving conduct that is wrongful and reckless or wanton, and likely to produce death or grievous bodily harm to another person. There are several kinds of endangerment, each of which is a criminal act that can be prosecuted in a court. In some U.S. states, such as Florida, substantially similar language is used for the crime of Culpable negligence.

The offense is intended to prohibit and therefore deter reckless or wanton conduct that wrongfully creates a substantial risk of death or serious injury to others.

En este Video Programa, no exploraremos lo que ya se ha hablado al cansancio en otros canales acerca del Novel Corona Virus 2019. Mostraremos más bien nuestras hipótesis acerca del encubrimiento de lo que creemos es la real magnitud de la propagación de la enfermedad y las proyecciones reales basadas en datos sumistrados por un video de una enfermera en Wuhan y de páginas como la de la ""Asociación Matemática Americana"" Entre otras acerca de los periodos de incubación. Con esos datos hacemos la proyección de infección y la tasa de fallecimientos. Además veremos videos filtrados donde se ven conductas agresivas tipo Zombie en algunos de los infectados, ¿Será que nos ocultan los verdaderos síntomas y forma de propagación del 2019 nCov? ¿Será que estamos viviendo el inicio del apocalipsis? También compartiremos evidencia circunstancial que puede probar la hipótesis que élites oscuras fueron las mentes maestras y desde el 2008 nos avisaron a través de un juego de mesa de sus intenciones de liberar una pandemia que empezara en la ciudad de Wuhan. 
El video es largo pero super informativo y los videos filtrados los harán saltar de sus asientos. Espero que esto les abra los ojos de la realidad que nos ocultan.

My predictions from [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/eusz3g/people_arent_fully_realizing_the_economic_impact/) 22 days ago, which you obviously didn't bother read since you were too eager to start criticizing people:

> ""What this means is that any Western company that relies significantly on China for revenue would see their first quarter earning absolutely crushed, especially considering their forecasts were done with the assumption of this quarter being the best quarter of the year.""

Pretty obvious right? and indeed...

https://www.bbc.com/news/business-51386575

https://www.marketwatch.com/story/coach-parent-tapestry-reports-earnings-beat-but-coronavirus-outbreak-weighs-on-guidance-2020-02-06

https://www.cnbc.com/2020/02/06/reuters-america-update-1-coronavirus-forces-estee-lauder-to-trim-fiscal-2020-profit-forecast.html

Hell, you asked for specific prediction, I predicted what would happen to YUM's project [17 days ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/ex2xh5/apple_temporarily_shuts_all_stores_and_offices_in/fg601xe/?context=3), 5 days ahead of YUM's [own earning report](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/02/06/yum-brands-yum-earnings-q4-2019-miss-estimates.html), forecasting *the same thing*.

Or how about this specific prediction:

> ""For example I’m foreseeing Apple miss their Greater China’s revenue by as much as 50% this quarter""

That was 2 days before Tim Cook gave out an earning forecast with wider range of uncertainty than usual, and just even then they are still [going to be missing it](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-02-17/apple-doesn-t-expect-to-meet-revenue-guidance-for-march-quarter). Yes, **I literally called this better than Tim Cook himself did**. The jury is still out on the 50% part, but I may have been too conservative in fact.

Ok those were the easy ones, how about more?

> ""Further more this will impact the global manufacturing and supply chain significantly. ""

Way too many links to paste here if I wanna go that route, from Nintendo to Hyundai, so many big companies are impacted.

Or how about something few people thought about?

> ""One final point is due to the significantly reduced traveling, China’s energy demand for this quarter would also be drastically reduced.""

Man I'm getting used to this: https://www.cnbc.com/2020/02/12/opec-report-coronavirus-expected-to-weaken-oil-demand-growth-in-2020.html

Those are just the ones I think matter enough to point out...but no, I don't make too many predictions usually.

>And we can throw a remindMe bot on it to check up.

No need, they all came true **already**.

Now can you contribute to anything useful on this sub than being an asshole to people? What are *your* predictions?"

As mods, we find it difficult at times to balance the freedom and fairness of news, with the necessity to maintain a reasonable degree of responsibility towards the targeted vitriol towards an specific individual. There are strong pent up emotions related to this disease, with no tangible person or object to blame. If the accusations are true, certainly an individual's selfish actions may cause an overwhelming reaction. While there is a strong inclination that the individual has been properly identified, with today’s media, we can never be entirely certain. As such, we feel it in everyone’s best interest that we maintain a certain degree of civility, especially in the unlikely case that we are wrong in identifying the individual. The media can be fickle these days.

I guess it only applies to people with cardiac problems already.  Ok from my understanding is that, I dont know if you can get it again but I have read that you can, so take that as you will, but the reason it gives you a fast heart attack or that it can is because of how difficult it is for the heart, lungs, kidney and body the first time, is my guess."

2. When will testing of patients with flu like symptoms for Coronavirus begin in Chicago?

3. What criteria are you looking at to determine whether to close public schools? Eg number of cases or rate of increase?

4. Why was the prison locked down? Were any of those folks tested for Coronavirus?

5. Can a patient with flu like symptoms request a Coronavirus test?

6. What is your current working assumption for the R0 of cover and what is the confidence interval? If you can cite specific analyses / math that would be great.

7. What do you think about the recent paper published by Los Alamos on Coronavirus?

8. Is Coronavirus a pandemic? If not what would you say is the probability of it becoming one?

9. Over the course of the next twelve months (not today) which is a greater risk to Illinois residents, flu or Coronavirus?

10. Can you share the state of Illinois pandemic preparedness plan? What contingencies kick in at various levels of outbreak?

11. Why do you report new positive figures only three times a week instead of daily?

12. Everyone knows China is falsifying their numbers. How many do you think are infected by Coronavirus worldwide, really?

13. In the state of Illinois, how many ICU beds are there and what percent of capacity are we? Same question for the city of Chicago.

14. Why is the CDC testing so few people?

15. At what threshold in terms of number of cases will you stop doing contact tracing?

16. What is your current working assumption for the case fatality rate and what are the error bars around it? Sources if you have them.

17. At this point, are you more worried about preventing panic or preventing the spread of Coronavirus?

18. If Chicago hospitals are overwhelmed, are there contingency locations to put patients such as schools or airports? I assume we would not try to build a hospital in a day.

19. The reason people are panicking and speculating is because what we are hearing from the media (“the flu kills a lot more people”) completely inconsistent with the actions we are seeing governments take. 760 million people in lockdown. A hospital built in 10 days. Heathrow airport being turned into quarantine zone. Military bases used for quarantine. Can you comment on that?"

National pride is a flawed concept. People don’t seem to be proud of the world. Rarely are they proud of their neighbourhood or their city. But for some fucking reason they are proud of their country. You can’t be proud without one way or another looking down on other countries.

When someone comes to the hospital with suspicion for pneumonia it's pretty standard for the patient to get a standard respiratory panel which screens for a number of viruses, including coronavirus. However, I'm not sure if SARS-CoV-2 is similar enough to the ""common cold"" coronavirus that it would be picked up by the test. My assumption would be yes, but I'm not sure. I will ask my hospital's lab tomorrow.

If a patient did pop positive for coronavirus on the respiratory panel, you better believe we'd be asking the patient more than just ""have you had any contacts in China""."

You can't judge a forecast based solely on whether or not it comes true. No one has a proven track record of consistently making the right call on big important issues. They'd need a crystal ball to do so. The fundamentally chaotic nature of international relations makes it impossible to make bold, accurate predictions. 

Take the recent coronavirus outbreak for example. Economists now have to significantly revise their growth forecasts as a result. Does their failure to foresee this event make them bad economists?

The value of a geopolitical forecast is not in its ability to tell you what will happen, but what you should pay attention to.

George Friedman's analysis is tremendously flawed, but no one can call him unintelligent or uninformed. Give him credit for focusing on traditional underlying geopolitical dynamics such as balance of power between nation states at a time when others like Fukuyama were predicting the ""End of History"". Zeihan is similar in that some of his specific insights are probably too ambitious, but he points out issues which are very unlikely to change such as geography, demographics, and access to resources."

From what I can gather the base rate for a normal flu in Singapore is something like 100 people catching it per day. The known new daily cases of coronavirus are about 5 a day, however we do not know how many undiagnosed cases are around. The best scientific estimate I have seen is 1.8x the diagnosed cases, so that makes about 14 new cases a day. By this logic, my prior should be 12% that I caught the coronavirus, yeah? That can then be adjusted down since I have not had contact with any known cases. This looks very convincing on paper, but I feel that it does not gel well with China taking enormous precautions and still failing to stop the spread. I mean, you could do the same analysis in the beginning of every epidemic growing exponentially, and conclude that you are unlikely to catch it, but that ignores the exponential growth projection. It really boils down to what is the transmission rate, and it seems very high, yeah? The Singapore authorities are comparing it to H1N1 which infected 400,000 people, or very roughly 10% of the population.

I want to hear his screams from the schools on the outskirts of town. I want him to be incinerated slowly and painfully as he’s live-streamed on the news. Desperate people try to save him only to be mercilessly gunned down by the government. Helicopters fire into the crowd of protesters at random. Police throw live grenades into the audience. He slowly falls into the chamber and the people are in outrage. How could the government let this happen? they cry. Those few with guns fire back at the cops and helicopters. A cop threatens to throw a tear gas container filled with the Wuhan coronavirus into the crowd and they fall silent. Suddenly, a helicopter dives into the crowd, killings tens of protesters. Riots break out and bricks are thrown across the nation. People fight for hours to save Yoda and his nuggies. The fighting spreads throughout the globe. People fight for weeks across all front against each other and the government. The fighting ends dramatically one day with the dropping of nuclear bombs in Manhattan, Detroit, Los Angels, and some backwater city in Ohio. As the country falls to infighting, those who started the first conflict give birth to children. The parents die and the children take up the fight. It rages for decades. People begin to forget what they’re fighting for. They search for an answer. One woman finds a scrap of singed brown cloth near an incineration plant, covering a small pile of bones. Baby yoda was never incinerated. He escaped. But people never realized. And he starved to death because he burned his chiccy nuggies. The world reels at this revelation. Then the Chinese drop two nuclear bombs on more major American cities. The country is forgotten in time and falls to infighting. The world slowly crumbles. Thousands of years later, you can still see the scars borne upon the Earth by Baby Yoda and his cult like followers. You can visit derelict cities on the coast of the BAMA-Atlanta Line and see his name carved into the houses. The name of a god to some. A demon to others. But one thing is certain. Baby Yoda and his nuggies changed the cosmic balance forever. In what way is not known. But you can feel it’s impacts from the shifting sands on Mars, to the acid seas on Venus, even to the icy winds of Europa. No one is ever truly gone."

>Ports are also starting to run out of electricity points to freeze the containers and some ships have been told to reroute to other destinations in mainland China and Hong Kong, the people said.

>China is a massive importer of meat from South America, Europe and also the U.S., and has been boosting purchases to help ease shortages caused by African swine fever. The country increased imports of meat and offal by almost 50% in 2019 to a record of about 6.2 million tons, customs data show.

The facility was designed by an institute in Shanghai within just 10 hours.

The Changjiangxincheng District Cabin Hospital, now being built in the Hongqiao Group Industrial Park of Wuhan, will feature 20 mobile cabins and contain over 3,000 beds to treat novel coronavirus patients with mild symptoms.

Construction started on February 15 and is scheduled to be completed on Tuesday.

To meet the demanding schedule, Shanghai Municipal Engineering Design Institute (Group) Co finished the design in only 9 hours and 42 minutes.

The institute received the urgent task from the construction and investment group of Changjiangxincheng District at 8pm on February 14, which required a finished design before 6am on the next day, according to the institute.

It soon organized a design team of 44 senior architects and civil engineers. The team started designing at 10:30pm.

The blueprint was optimized based on newly released makeshift hospital standards in Wuhan. The designers made some modifications to ensure both schedule and safety, the institute said.

They called several of the institute's most experienced chief engineers after midnight to help solve various challenges.

They reevaluated the design at 4:15am and completed the task on time at 6am.

""No one felt tired after working overnight,"" said Liu Jun, head of the design team. ""Not a single second can be wasted during the race against the virus,"" he added.

The blueprint was then sent to Li Wei and Zhu Wei, two engineers with the Wuhan branch of the institute. They rushed to the site to guide construction. Designers in Shanghai are also offering assistance through video conference around the clock.

The first batch of trucks entered the site at 8am on February 15, marking the beginning of construction for the hospital.

The cabin hospital, mainly renovated from the large warehouses in the industrial park, features large greenery coverage and is away from the noisy traffic.

Wuhan has built 11 temporary cabin hospitals at convention centers, stadiums and universities to treat infected patients with mild symptoms. They can offer a total of 20,461 beds to relieve a shortage of medical beds in the city."

Also quoting the article: "" While it is possible to buy the N95 respirator online, Schaffner advised against it.

2020-02-18,Alblaka,technology,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/f5elp4/youtube_coronavirus_videos_will_be_automatically/fi038fe/,"I think YT is running into the same old issue of not being able to handle all the content uploaded correctly. Similar to the whole deal with their algorythm accidentally helping pedophiles,

they don't have enough manpower to actually check every single video that mentions the corona-virus. Thus, rather than allowing a vast swath of clearly exploitative fearmongering videos to profit off the loss of human life, they chose to apply a sledgehammer to the situation and demonetize everything, at the expense/risk of unfairly doing it to content that actually covers the coronavirus correctly, too.

I must admit, if you're only given those two options to chose from, Youtube did make the right call. **BUT** one should remember that they dug their own hole there, by completely neglecting to build an infrastructure that can actually handle the massive amount of content put up on their platform in first place. Would they have ensured to build that infrastructure over years, they would be in a position to both target exploitative content, yet not harm legitimate content in the process."

Let's play it out, assuming coronavirus has gone wild in the USA for the primaries, and nearly everyone who shows up at the polls gets the virus.

Trump is the incumbent, so Republican turnout will be a fraction of Democrat turnout for the primaries (as it always is for incumbents). As a result, more democrats will die than republicans, because more democrats went to the polls.

All of this winds up having negligible results in the general election in November, because Trump will still win re-election by an utter landslide.  Regardless, Democrats will start a new investigation into Trump for colluding with China to kill off Democrat voters to win the election and try to impeach him again.

I'm sure there's a dossier being funded by the DNC right now showing Trump spliced the HIV genes into the coronavirus himself at the Wuhan lab while a body double was at the North Korean DMZ meeting with Kim.  That will be used to get more FISA warrants based on falsified hearsay whistleblower reports filed by ""senior government officials"", who heard from a friend who heard from another friend who heard from his boyfriend's secretary's partner who works the coffee shop at the CIA, that after Trump released the virus he hired some hookers to pee on President's Xi's bed and Chinese intelligence has the tapes to make Trump their puppet."

Q:  Is it safe to recieve a letter or a package from China?  
A: Yes, it is safe. People receiving packages are not at risk of contracting coronavirus. From experience with other coronaviruses, we know that these viruses do not survive long on objects, such as letters or packages.\*

The spread of the coronavirus had led many to wonder whether the Olympics could be cancelled altogether, though organisers said last week there are no plans to postpone or cancel the Games."

> BEIJING - When cameraman Mark Xia returned to his job this month after holidays, the Shanghai video production house where he worked told him to take three months of leave with no pay, as a coronavirus epidemic takes a toll of China&#039;s businesses.

> Job losses could run as high as 4.5 million, he forecast.

> Rising job losses could hurt incomes and consumption, reducing the chance of a sharp recovery in the economy once the outbreak is contained, economists said.

In the United Kingdom, a DSMA-Notice (Defence and Security Media Advisory Notice) is an official request to news editors not to publish or broadcast items on specified subjects for reasons of national security. DSMA-Notices were formerly called a DA-Notice (Defence Advisory Notice), and before that called a Defence Notice (D-Notice) until 1993. 

As of 2020, the system is still in use in the United Kingdom. A similar system was previously operational in Australia, but has fallen into disuse.

Coronaviruses can and do happen in many countries. It has a name- the NCoV-2019, or its new WHO designation, COVID-19.
2. Wuhan happens to be one of the largest and most populous provinces in China... and China is the country with the highest population in the world, where many important research universities are located. For years and years and years there have been rumors about the Chinese developing weapons against the West in all forms. The fact that people years ago wrote a science fiction book where a bioweapon was developed in Wuhan doesn't... really have any significance at all??? **The name and nature of what is described in this book bears literally no resemblance to the coronavirus other than the fact that it originated in Wuhan. Lots of things happen in Wuhan, it's an international economic hub and a very well-known part of China.** It's not like the virus originated in some never-heard-of small town and now you've found a book that references a virus from that little town by name.
3. There is absolutely no evidence that the coronavirus was manmade, either as a bioweapon or an experiment or anything else. Listen, I am always cynical and inclined to believe something sinister may be happening, but THERE IS NO EVIDENCE FOR IT. Coronaviruses develop naturally, and can be communicated commonly by a variety of animals. There are strains of coronavirus in the United States that are very common, they are just more controllable and not as communicable. I know people that have had coronavirus, just not the Chinese strain. It's completely plausible that in a highly populated area, strains could have mutated and been passed from animal to human. There is no reason yet in this case to think that anything sinister is happening, and spreading misinformation to the contrary can be incredibly damaging for containment efforts."

'TOKYO: Japan’s health minister yesterday urged the public to avoid crowds and “non-essential gatherings”, including notoriously packed commuter trains, to prevent the new coronavirus from spreading in the country. Katsunobu Kato warned the nation was “entering a new phase” in the outbreak of the virus, which has infected nearly 60 people in Japan so far. “We want to ask the public to avoid non-urgent, non-essential gatherings. We want elderly and those with pre-existing conditions to avoid crowded places,” Kato said after a meeting of a panel of experts.'

I was leaving work today. I’m also Asian American. I got in the elevator and two floors down a few people get on.

On the ride down I started coughing a bit. One of the people (a white person, of course) flares at me an conspicuously takes a step away from me.

I immediately say loudly “fuck you, racist.” The person looks taken aback and responds “excuse me?” I tell her “just because I’m Asian doesn’t mean I have coronavirus you piece of shit.”

We reach the bottom, she gets all up in my face, points her pale-bony finger in my face and says “fuck you” to me to fuck off before storming off.” The other people in the elevator gave me an angry look as well.

But why? She’s white and stupid; she’s obviously racist. Just because I’m coughing doesn’t mean I have coronavirus. Why was she being such a fucking cunt to me for no reason?
I swear to god white people are all fucking useless racists.

Coronavirus victims or quarantined.

Homeless. 

Affected by Opioid addiction, Obesity etc.

Minimum-wage earner.

Disaster victim.

Both Beijing and Ho Chi Minh is due to friends living there and/or major events to attend. I have 3 weeks booked so just need to figure out the balance between the 3 cities! 

If the virus is still a thing, then I will switch and go to Europe and just wander for 3 weeks."

Out of curiosity could you not order it off amazon or somewhere similar? Got my i3 mega off amazon and arrived in about 3 days. If you can I'd try cancel the oder and get it from there instead.

I'm the meantime I'd email customer service about it and say you didn't get a confirmation email.

They normally take a few business days to reply.
Had to order a replacement screen. Took them about a day to reply then a week to confirm it had been shipped then just over two weeks to be shipped from China."

Not just 10 people, everyone would know. They have protocols for positive coronavirus patients that include asking for volunteer nurses who will do their 12 hour shift exclusively with the patient in a full on hazmat suit. My sister signed up to volunteer if they ever got a patient. Everyone would be very much aware.   However, if they aren’t tested then i guess that’s a different story. Im just not sure why you think only 10 people would know if there is a positive case? Are you saying they aren’t telling the hospitals?"
