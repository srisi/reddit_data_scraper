I saw this post by a healthcare professional that explains in brutal detail why everything is shut down.  One of the commenters admonished him to stop scaring people to death, go out and enjoy life, and coronavirus is a joke.  I looked at the guy's FB wall, and his most recent post was an Obama vs. Trump meme that blamed Obama for all the losses of the 2008 recession, and credited Trump with 100% of the gains since then.

  My prediction is that if Trump were to lose the election, Republican spin doctors will put all the blame on the next President.  They're already characterizing the empty shelves and hoarding as ""a preview of a Bernie Sanders Presidency"".  We're living through a real life Idiocracy.  We're not up against bad ideas and a bad candidate, we're up against weaponized stupidity; they're idiots, they're proud of their idiocy, and they vote in droves because their stupidity makes them easily excitable."

Emergency doctor Ignace Demeyer warns about this.  ""We see people with a blank medical history who are very ill.""  It's not just about older generations, either.  ""We have had very few older people inside so far,"" says Dr. Demeyer.  ""We now have people between the ages of 30 and 50 coming in.""
 
 
 ""They all have the same complaints,"" says Dr. Demeyer.  ""They have been sick for a week, stayed home with the flu. The flu attack is over, they think. They feel fine for two days. And then they report with complaints of a dry cough and shortness of breath. When we then have their oxygen saturation (level of  oxygen in our blood, ed.), we see that they have very low oxygen saturations for their age. ""

 At that time, a clear alarm goes off to the doctors that it concerns problem patients, but people themselves do not always realize it because they do not feel very ill at the time.  ""They just walk in, but they are terribly affected by the virus.""  Emergency doctor Demeyer also shows scans of the lungs of such a corona patient.  ""The images we took yesterday are nothing short of terrifying.""

 Inflammatory fluid
 The picture on the left shows normal lungs.  In the second photo, there are already alveoli that are 20 to 25 percent filled with inflammatory fluid.  The third scan is one step worse: it contains 80 to 90 percent inflammatory fluid.  ""Those people can of course still heal, but it is a life-threatening situation. And they are people who do not smoke, they have no other condition such as diabetes or heart failure. They are sporty young people.""

 Virologist Steven Van Gucht shares that concern.  ""That is one of the reasons why we advised the government to implement those drastic measures and why we ask everyone to follow them strictly.""  Doctor Demeyer calls ""some irresponsible behavior"" that some young people still do not see the seriousness and organize parties or go on weekends.”"

* Trump said the health guidelines aimed at mitigating the spread of coronavirus could extend into the summer. The president said experts have told him to expect that this new reality could extend into July or August and possibly longer.



* Trump says he's not currently considering nationwide lockdown


* “At this point, not nationwide,” Trump said. “We may look at certain areas, certain hotspots.”
A number of European countries and US states have announced lockdowns in recent days.
“We look forward to the day that we can get back to normal,” Trump said.

* Trump was asked about his comment yesterday that his administration has “tremendous control” over the coronavirus crisis.

* The president said he was not claiming the White House has control over the virus itself. “If you’re talking about the virus, that’s not under control for any place in the world,” Trump said.

* In comparison to his past comments on the pandemic, the president’s remarks today sound much more grim and thus more in line with comments from health experts.

* Trump said he was not currently considering implementing a national curfew to mitigate the spread of coronavirus.

* In a surprising note from this president, Trump said he believed the media has been “very fair” in its coverage of the crisis.

* Trump also expressed support for the airline industry, which is seeing steep financial losses because of the crisis.

* The White House has now said Americans should avoid gatherings larger than 10 people in order to slow the spread of the virus.

* Trump also said Americans should “avoid discretionary travel” as the administration tries to mitigate the virus’ spread.

* Dr Deborah Birx, the White House coronavirus response coordinator, specifically addressed millennials and asked them to comply with the health guidelines to protect more vulnerable

* These latest guidelines, which advise Americans to avoid gatherings larger than 10 people, will be in effect for 15 days, Fauci said. Then the coronavirus response team will revisit them. However, Fauci said experts expect coronavirus cases to continue into the summer and possibly later."

We've had cheap credit for the past 20 years, and as a result corporations have taken on a huge amount of debt. Banks could loan them even more money to keep the lights on through the recession... but what incentive is there for that? The risk vs return doesn't make it seem like a good deal.

So what will happen? Well, the Fed is going to use QE to buy up a lot of this questionable debt from banks' balance sheets, and the legislature will probably pass some sort of fiscal stimulus measures, maybe something like giving everyone $1000.

All of this will inflate the amount of sovereign debt (treasury bills), which will make funding the government much harder if (when) interest rates ever rise in the future.

There are a lot of moving parts, so it's hard to really know what will happen, but:

  * debt begets more debt in ever-increasing amounts
  * corporate debt tends to be converted to sovereign debt
  * too much sovereign debt can only end up in default or hyperinflation

Best case (at least, from one perspective), the Fed causes 10 years of stagflation where the economy limps along while the dollar loses value at a relatively steady and predictable rate."

2020-03-16,Mycotrollop,Coronavirus,33,https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/fjwi9l/in_the_part_of_italy_hit_hardest_by_the/fkpem06/,"ROME — In the part of Italy hit hardest by the coronavirus, the crematorium has started operating 24 hours a day. Coffins have filled up two hospital morgues, and then a cemetery morgue, and are now being lined up inside a cemetery church. The local newspaper's daily obituary section has grown from two or three pages to 10, sometimes listing more than 150 names, in what the top editor likens to ""war bulletins.""

By death toll alone, the coronavirus has landed in the northern province of Bergamo with the force of a historic disaster.

But its alarming power goes even further, all but ensuring that death and mourning happen in isolation — a trauma in which everybody must keep to themselves.

All across Bergamo, people are being picked up in ambulances, rushed to the hospital and dying in sealed-off wards where even their closest relatives are not allowed. Many funerals are taking place with only a priest and funeral-home employee present, while family members face restrictions on gathering, remain in quarantine or are too sick themselves.

So many have died that there is a waiting list for burial and cremation.

“I think it’s worse than a war,” said Marta Testa, 43, who is in self-quarantine and whose father died Wednesday of the virus at age 85. “Dad is waiting to be buried. And we are here waiting to tell him goodbye.”

[Live coronavirus updates: U.S. life shuts down; surgeon general warns ‘we could be Italy’]

Other countries are only beginning to grapple with the pandemic’s implications and the distance it forces between even the closest people. But in Italy, death by lonely death, its full cost is becoming apparent.
More than 2,000 people in Italy have died of covid-19, the disease caused by virus — half of them over the most recent five-day stretch — and many of those cases have looked like that of Testa’s father, Renzo, a former newspaper advertising executive who felt short of breath a week ago Saturday, was taken to the hospital and did not see or talk to his family again.

“Grief is a phase that requires closeness, but our grief has had to come via the telephone,” said Testa, whose parents had been married for 50 years and whose mother also appears to have the virus but is recovering.

Testa’s siblings bring food to their mother. Out of precaution, they leave it on her front door.

“Right now,” Testa said, “our family is living in a suspended state.”

Even as the virus has spread around the world, it is in Italy where people are contracting the virus — and dying of it — more rapidly than anywhere else. On Sunday, the country reported 368 new deaths, a toll exceeding even the highest daily figures from China. By Monday, 349 died, bringing the total in less than one month to 2,158.

[As coronavirus cases grow, hospitals in northern Italy are running out of beds]

And within Italy, Bergamo, a wealthy province of 1.1 million to the east of Milan, has become the most worrying hot spot. Hospitals are at the breaking point there. Military doctors have been called in to assist. Residents describe Bergamo as a ghostly place where only ambulances and hearses are on the road at night. In the small town of Nembro, according to the Corriere della Sera newspaper, 70 people have died in the past 12 days. Some 120 died all of last year.
“It’s as if a chemical bomb has exploded,” said Daniela Taiocchi, 49, who helps handle obituaries for the local newspaper, L’Eco di Bergamo.

Bergamo also stands as a warning sign about how coronavirus cases can explode if restrictions are not quickly put in place. Italy dealt with an initial hot spot, in the province of Lodi, by placing 10 small towns under lockdown more than three weeks ago. But the government waited far longer to put similar measures in place elsewhere. Bergamo now has three times the number of coronavirus cases as Lodi.

“Morgues and health institutions are collapsing,” said Claudia Scotti, a funeral-home co-owner. “We were absolutely unprepared for an emergency of this kind.”

The people who are dying, memorialized in page after page of the L’Eco di Bergamo, are ex-politicians, electricians, emergency phone operators, priests. Most are in their 70s or 80s. Their short obituaries don’t mention the cause of death but don’t need to — 90 percent, the newspaper’s editor estimated, died because of the coronavirus. Instead, the obituaries have other clues about how much grieving has changed during the emergency. They mention “direct transport to the crematorium.” A public ceremony at a “date to be determined.” A funeral held in a “strictly private form.”

[In coronavirus lockdown, Milan sheds its reputation for aloofness, grows closer — from a distance]

Across the country, funerals inside churches have been put on hold, part of the government’s absolute restriction on gatherings. For families cleared to leave their homes, some in Bergamo have been allowed to meet for small burials at the cemetery, capped at 10 people. But aside from those moments, the city has closed the cemeteries entirely, fearing that residents would take public transportation, visit the graves of those who have died and spread the virus themselves.

The mayor’s office has encouraged the cremation of people who die of covid-19. And on Wednesday, the local crematorium began operating around the clock.

“It never closes, and still we don’t manage,” said Francesco Alleva, a spokesman for the mayor."

So, as some of you may have seen my retarded positions, I spent $156k today to buy 2070 spy 288c 3/31 why spy was around 246 today.

Here is why I think I am NOT an idiot and my bet will pay off.

1- market dropped 10% today; and has to breath back.

2- fed pumped a fuck load and cut the rates this weekend to zero percent.

3- the volume of SPY 3/20 puts are 10 times higher than the past several weeks; and all the shorts and put holders will squeeze out by end of day Friday. 

4- a third stimulus package aimed at helping big industries is on its way!

Saying all this; here is what I am at fuck load of risk:
1-coronavirus deadtoll piles up and we don’t open green tomorrow

2-market closes and i am royally fucked

3- the drop tomorrow -Thursday is great her than 10% which by that time any pump on Friday would be useless 

4- third wave of stimulus package doesn’t come in on time or freak out people even more.

Saying all this; please provide your constructive thoughts on what do you think I should do tomorrow. Hold till Friday or sale at market open? Either way I am looking to get in bulk train by Friday

Now saying all this; yes I fully don’t expect SOY to go to 288 by 3/31; but if the market gets to 260 by Friday 3/20, my money should double"

Hello again to everyone! Let’s just jump straight into this good news stuff today, shall we? I’ve got a *lot* of awesome stuff to cover so no prelude rambling from me this time. 

-First off, in addition to drugs such as remdesivir (currently in trials), [another potential treatment for the virus has been found!](https://ipfs.infura.io/ipfs/QmNcF4usFUJdGjTMtEXT1XAYybJvtLmEjaZnvNXN2n91Zh/) This drug has been in use since 1945 to treat malaria, and shows promise as a suitable antiviral to fight COVID-19. The authors of the study state that it can result in “faster time to recovery and shorter hospital stay(s)”. The more treatments we have in testing, the better!

-[Here is an article](https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-outbreak-diamond-princess-cruise-ship-death-rate) which (despite its somewhat evocative headline) goes into detail on explaining the potential death rate of the virus using the Diamond Princess cruise ship as a study. Essentially, those were perfect conditions for the virus to wreak the most havoc. The ship was mostly full of older people, they were in close proximity to each other, all breathing the same air... if a virus was going to spread anywhere, it’d be there. *AND YET*... the death rate is 0.5 percent on that ship. This article postulates that this may help us more accurately pin down what we may expect the death rate to actually be. In other words, according to these folks, we can expect the death rate to maybe plane closer to 0.5 percent... obviously significantly lower than the current 3.4 percent. 

-[More good news from the Diamond Princess!](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www3.nhk.or.jp/nhkworld/en/news/20200316_10/amp.html) According to this article, the last group of patients on board the ship have recovered and are now able to go home- I believe this is just those still in Tokyo, but still, awesome news! 

-[Here’s an article](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/fji8x6/200305003_high_temperature_and_high_humidity/?utm_source=share&amp;amp;amp;amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;amp;amp;amp;utm_name=iossmf) from Cornell which indicates that our hopes may not be invalid- the virus seems to struggle to spread under high heat and humidity! In other words- when summer rolls around in the northern hemisphere, the rate of infection is expected to slow. Slower rate of infection means less burden on hospitals means a higher survival rate! Oh, and just in case that wasn’t enough? [Here’s a different study with similar findings, bam!](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.12.20034728v1)

-Let’s go just a bit deeper on the expected case fatality rate. I’m going to provide three links. As a nerd, I [really loved this one, first.](https://coronawiki.org/page/new-coronavirus-why-its-so-deadly-in-italy) This article goes into depth on Italy vs. South Korea, and the reason why S.K. is showing such a low case fatality rate (currently 0.98%) while Italy’s is so much higher. I’ll pull out the two most crucial parts: first, Italy has a significantly higher average age when compared to South Korea (and even most other countries in general). This raises a question: is Italy the outlier, or is S.K.? The answer the article came to is that S.K. is *likely to be more indicative of the global case fatality rate*, and therefore, this places the final, actual CFR *around one percent*. Not 3.4 percent. Not 8 percent. **One percent.** 

Further evidence on that last point, [here is an article on why the case fatality rate will probably turn out to be lower.](https://slate.com/technology/2020/03/coronavirus-mortality-rate-lower-than-we-think.html) Don’t worry, if you clicked that link and saw the update at the top of the page, I’m going to talk about it in a bit. 

Oh... [one more study](https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-17453/v1) that puts us around that 1 percent mark- this one actually estimates the CFR to be lower than currently reported for *all* groups, including the elderly!

-[Here is a fantastic study](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fped.2020.00104/full) which indicates that pregnant mothers, infected with the virus, can *not* transmit the illness to the baby while she’s pregnant!

I love the science but that’s not all you need, I’m sure. Let’s rapid-fire through just a small handful of other great things I saw today.

-[Mitt Romney may be a conservative](https://thehill.com/homenews/senate/487794-romney-proposes-sending-1000-to-every-american-adult-amid-coronavirus?fbclid=IwAR2aZJA5E5PdjtQZxGeJCO6und-klNzilV-9Jae78x_zdjnhT-mk0aY9XOk), but even he knows the necessity to keep Americans paid during this time. He proposed that all Americans get $1000 this month to help us get through it, and if *he’s* saying it, well... he’s going to have a lot of support getting that to go through, on both sides of the aisle. 

-[The owner of Taco Bell, KFC, and Pizza Hut](https://www.restaurantbusinessonline.com/financing/taco-bells-owner-will-pay-workers-during-coronavirus-closures) plans on paying workers through the closings of the restaurants! According to the article, both McDonald’s and Starbucks have similar plans as well. 

-[Tom Hanks and Rita Wilson have been released from the hospital! They’ve fully recovered!](https://www.google.com/amp/s/amp.cnn.com/cnn/2020/03/16/entertainment/tom-hanks-rita-wilson-released-hospital-coronavirus/index.html) Like many people smarter than myself have said, now including this couple, “take it one day at a time”. Additionally, they reported that their symptoms were pretty mild. 

-[For my U.K. friends](https://www.google.com/amp/s/amp.cnn.com/cnn/2020/03/16/europe/boris-johnson-uk-coronavirus-response-ramped-up/index.html), Boris Johnson announced today that they are changing their strategy from the old one to one which more closely resembles what the rest of the world is doing. Expect to see more good news, policies, and plans to start rolling out this week. 

-The trend continues to rise! [Worldometer once again reports](https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/) another uptick in the mild cases- we are now up to **94% mild!!** Even for all my optimism, I’m shocked to see this trend continue in such a positive way. 

Ugh, guys... I need you to believe me on this but I have seen just *so much freakin great news today* on this whole thing. I *promise* I have more to share but as you can tell... this thing is long enough as it is. I had a whole lot planned to write on the underlying conditions and high-risk populations, testing too, and most importantly I felt I *really* need to talk about staying home and social isolation... but this is probably pushing the character limit as it is already. I think tomorrow morning I’m just literally going to bullet point the good news to the best of my ability rather than explaining every one in detail- but don’t worry, I’m still going to do that too for my main posts like this. 

When you’re done with this post, I want you to soak up every bit of optimism I’ve tried to give you. I want you to use that optimism as a boost of momentum to get your day going and keep on moving forward with whatever needs to be done. Keep your heads high everyone. Stay the fuck home. Wash your hands. Love you all so much and I will see you tomorrow.


If you need more good news, here’s my [first](http://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/eupik4/coronavirus_megathread/fkezb7w), [second](http://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/eupik4/coronavirus_megathread/fkgkszf), [third](http://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/eupik4/coronavirus_megathread/fki38kr), and [fourth](http://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/eupik4/coronavirus_megathread/fklp28i) posts.

They have had record levels of open positions in government branches because he can't stop firing people without backup plans. When he does appoint someone it's a ""yes man"" lackey that does whatever Trump tweets about on any given day.

Lets be honest here too, Trump governs to the moment, he doesn't really plan anything. Whatever is the hot topic of the day is where his attention goes and he doesn't think through the long term. Beyond that he constantly overrides experts rather than letting them do their jobs.

The CDC lost some of their most senior scientists. The pandemic team was cut down. The Trump administration tried to prevent local health offices in various States from testing for coronavirus. WA ignored him and did anyway, and lo and behold confirmed it's here.

He installed lame ducks in the Federal Reserve and pressured them from day 1 to keep rates low, which is the last thing you want to do in an expansion, because then you have no ammunition to help recovery in a recession, which was overdue.

The guy fucking is absolutely responsible for how bad it's going to get. He's not responsible for the fact coronavirus exists but he's responsible for exacerbating the bubble that is now popping and then doing nothing to prepare for this pandemic."

EDIT: PAYWALL

Boeing Co. has asked White House and Congressional officials for short-term aid for itself, suppliers and airlines as the outlook for the travel industry worsens by the day because of the coronavirus outbreak, said people familiar with the matter.

The U.S. planemaker is seeking to avoid layoffs and damage to hundreds of smaller companies that make parts and systems for its aircraft, said the people, who asked not to be named because the talks are private. Boeing has also been buffeted by the grounding of its best-selling 737 Max, which awaits regulatory clearance to resume flights after two deadly crashes.

Boeing, European rival Airbus SE and a constellation of suppliers are navigating the sharpest industry downturn since at least the 9/11 terrorist attacks as nations close borders and airlines ground fleets of aircraft. The aerospace sector faces “extreme disruptions” in the near term and possibly beyond, Ron Epstein, an analyst with Bank of America Corp., said in a report to clients Monday.

“In our view, global airline business models will be stressed, airlines will cut capex, growth plans will be slashed and there will be airline bankruptcies,” Epstein said. “The 737 Max program could be especially hard hit due to its own idiosyncratic circumstances.”

In a statement, Boeing confirmed that “ongoing, positive discussions continue with government and industry leaders” — including in the Trump administration and Congress. Near-term access to public and private funds is key for the entire aerospace industry, which has a strong long-term outlook but an “urgent challenge” from the virus, the company said.

“Short-term access to public and private liquidity will be one of the most important ways for airlines, airports, suppliers and manufacturers to bridge to recovery,” Boeing said in the statement. “We appreciate how the administration and Congress are engaging with all elements of the aviation industry during this difficult time.”

The White House has been in touch with Boeing over the virus, said a senior administration official. President Donald Trump earlier said that the U.S. government would “back the airlines 100%” — a point he then emphasized in a tweet. A trade group, Airlines for America, said passenger carriers need $50 billion in aid, plus another $8 billion for air cargo companies.

Boeing tumbled 24% to $129.61 at the close in New York, the lowest price since September 2016. The shares have lost more than half their value this year, making Boeing the biggest laggard on the Dow Jones Industrial Average.


S&P Global Ratings downgraded Boeing two notches to BBB, or two steps above junk. The ratings company predicted a free cash outflow of $11 billion to $12 billion this year followed by a weaker-than-expected recovery next year as a result of the prolonged 737 Max grounding.

“In addition, the significant reduction in global air travel due to the coronavirus will likely result in an increase in aircraft order deferrals, further pressuring cash flows,” the ratings company said.

Boeing and Airbus are marshaling resources and preparing contingency plans as the coronavirus pandemic wreaks havoc on global travel.

Airbus is “looking at all kind of scenarios to maintain business continuity,” according to a company statement. The factories are open, and Airbus is following health and safety protocols as well as national regulations. The French government on Monday night announced new measures to contain the virus.

Bloomberg News reported earlier this month that the Toulouse, France-based manufacturer was evaluating a cut to its annual target for jet deliveries as virus-shocked customers sought to delay handovers.

For Chicago-based Boeing, the planning also encompasses potential factory shutdowns. Production continues for now across the company and at a complex in Everett, Washington, which is contending with a virus outbreak.

Boeing said it is coordinating with government officials on the best course of action at the plant, which makes the 747, 767 and 777 jets, as well as 787 Dreamliners. About 36,000 people are employed at the 1,000-acre site, which also includes engineering offices and a composite-wing factory.

The company has taken steps to bolster cash reserves, drawing down a $13.8 billion loan as a precaution amid tumultuous markets.

Whether Boeing will need to take additional measures, such as slashing the dividend, will depend on the length and severity of the outbreak — and the return of the Max after a grounding that has already surpassed the one-year mark.

“They have ample cash now. They have lots of uncertainties,” Carter Copeland of Melius Research, said of Boeing in an interview March 13. “They also have levers.”

A nightmare scenario for Boeing would be a slow recovery that upends the competitive balance with Airbus, said Richard Aboulafia, an aerospace analyst with Teal Group. So far, customers have been reluctant to ditch the 737 Max for the Airbus counterpart, the A320neo family, which is sold out through the mid-2020s.

In the worst case, he said, “demand stays flat and gaps appear in Airbus’s production schedule and they can accommodate defectors.”"

What's more important is to prevent the healthcare system from being overwhelmed. Based on current studies, 10-20% of infected are likely to end up in serious/critical condition as the virus progresses over a period 2-3 weeks. Most of these will eventually recover but for the worst cases, the outcome depends on the state of the healthcare system.

Experience from China and Italy suggests that if the healthcare system is overwhelmed, mortality rate will be much higher as there are simply not enough equipment (e.g. oxygen support) to treat/support those in serious/critical conditions (e.g. failing lungs).

For countries that are pro-active in containment (testing, screening, contact-tracing and isolation), mortality rate is much much lower as the healthcare system has the capacity to treat/support the serious/critical cases. 

 Also, while recovery rate for the younger is higher, some do get very sick too with serious pneumonia. Reports from Italy suggest increasing number of younger patients requiring intensive care.

We're pretty close to S&P 2350 which was the December 2018 low, though it's easy to argue we should be below that point given the economic problems that the coronavirus has exposed (way too many corporations gorged on cheap debt while throwing away cash on buybacks resulting in poor balance sheets, etc.).  Anywhere below S&P 2300 starts to present some really good long-term buying opportunities.

Bottoming is a process, and markets typically never bottom on days like today or last Thursday/Friday.

But a lot of crucial things happened in the past 24 hours: the Fed threw the whole recession fighting toolkit at the wall and Trump finally appears to have publicly acknowledged the real scope of the problem along with basically saying that we're in one of the worst case scenarios with this coronavirus slowdown/shutdown probably extending all the way to July/August.

Markets price in events based on expectations, and now we're getting to the point where the horror show that April/May will bring on the coronavirus front is really beginning to get priced into expectations.

So that's why I think it's starting to become likely that we find a bottom before April.  Of course, after that I'm skeptical of any sort of V-shaped recovery (we might get a mini-V 200+ point gain off a downside overshoot to S&P 2000-2100) but I expect a lot of choppiness and sidewards movement that will benefit theta/cash gang until late May."

Big money is looking at the long game in this coming recession and I want in.

Very near term: puts on apparel companies that rely heavily on foot traffic. They will be bleeding out the hardest: LULU, LB, GPS, KSS, TJX, JWN, ROST. I'm not sure about ROST (Ross) since that's where the newly poor will shop. GPS (Gap) and JWM (Nordstrom) might get an online game up in running in time to not die.

Malls failing really puts SPG (Simon Property Group) in a bad place. Might want to just get puts on that right now to be quite honest.

Mid term: Then there are the other real estate holdings that I know very little about. [With many US cities banning evictions during this time](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/us-cities-are-temporarily-banning-evictions-as-coronavirus-outbreak-worsens-2020-03-14?mod=home-page) Their revenue streams may get completely fucked. I think the play here is to see which companies have the most exposure in the low-income housing market. Tickers I need to read up about: VTR, O, WELL, VNO, AIV, WY, PEAK, SLG, KIM, FRT

Long term: Lastly, with the coming foreclosures there should be ample housing supply so puts on homebuilders: PHM, DHI, NVR, LEN

This means that you may need to use an alcohol with higher concentration such as 90% concentration or lower the additives as it dilutes the concentration of the alcohol. A lot of the sanitizer recipes she analyzes has lower than that concentration so they end up not being useful for their purpose.

2020-03-16,AggravatingPickle,soccer,17,https://www.reddit.com/r/soccer/comments/fjtwv2/rooney_rages_at_premier_leagues_baffling/fkoz440/,"Because the Mercury's website is cancer:  

Wayne Rooney has hit out at football’s authorities over their “baffling” decision to only suspend leagues in England when Arsenal manager Mikel Arteta contracted coronavirus, and not when three Leicester City players were quarantined with symptoms.  

The former England captain questioned why the FA, Premier League, and the government, were willing to treat players “like guinea pigs” despite the news on Thursday afternoon that a trio of City players were in self-isolation after showing mild signs of Covid-19.  

Later on Thursday evening, the Premier League released a statement saying that the weekend’s games would be played as usual, in front of thousands of fans, but were forced to set up an emergency meeting an hour later when the Gunners confirmed their head coach was ill with the virus.  

Rooney, now at Derby County, believes that if Leicester had a higher profile, like Arsenal, news of three of the players showing symptoms would have prompted the authorities into action.
“Why did we wait until Friday?” Rooney asked in his Sunday Times column. “Why did it take Mikel Arteta to get ill for the game in England to do the right thing? For players, staff and their families it has been a worrying week, one in which you felt a lack of leadership from the government and from the FA and Premier League.  

“At Derby County, we sat at training on Thursday waiting for Boris Johnson to speak. People were anxious. We’d heard in the morning that three Leicester City players had shown symptoms of coronavirus.  

“[The Prime Minister] said the schools are fine, let’s carry on, and what he said about sport was: ‘We’ll make a decision on it later.’
“You just thought: ‘He’s dodged it, he’s left the FA and Premier League to make the decision.’ When the FA and Premier League then didn’t make a decision either, it didn’t surprise me.  

“It felt baffling that with three Leicester players having symptoms we were still planning to go ahead with games. Then on Thursday night it came out that Arteta had the virus and all of a sudden the Premier League announced an emergency meeting the next morning. What was the difference? Is it that Arteta was a bigger name?  

“It felt typical of the way things are done in football. That Leicester aren’t a big enough team to cause any chaos, it’s fine, we carry on. Then as soon as one of the bigger clubs – Arsenal – are affected, we finally make a decision. It felt like we were trying to limp along, keep football going, instead of getting everyone for what’s going to come.  

“After the emergency meeting, at last the right decision was made – until then it felt like footballers in England were being treated like guinea pigs.”  

Football in England has been postponed until April 3, and Rooney said the governing bodies should be able to guarantee players’ and fans’ safety before allowing the game to restart, otherwise he would think about quitting the sport.  

“I hope we learn from it because the next decision is just as big: when do we start playing again?” he said.
“For me, that can only happen once, for players, fans, and everyone else, it is absolutely safe. The powers have to get that one right. I know how I feel: if any of my family get infected through me because I’ve had to pay when it’s not safe, and they get seriously ill, I’d have to think hard about ever playing again. I would never forgive the authorities.”"

>It has been alleged by multiple officials of the Obama administration, including in [The Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/outlook/nsc-pandemic-office-trump-closed/2020/03/13/a70de09c-6491-11ea-acca-80c22bbee96f_story.html?tid=lk_inline_manual_4&itid=lk_inline_manual_4), that the president and his then-national security adviser, John Bolton, “dissolved the office” at the White House in charge of pandemic preparedness. Because I led the very directorate assigned that mission, the counterproliferation and biodefense office, for a year and then handed it off to another official who still holds the post, I know the charge is specious.

>Now, I’m not naive. This is Washington. It’s an election year. Officials out of power want back into power after November. But the middle of a worldwide health emergency is not the time to be making tendentious accusations.

>When I joined the National Security Council staff in 2018, I inherited a strong and skilled staff in the counterproliferation and biodefense directorate. This team of national experts together drafted the [National Biodefense Strategy](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/National-Biodefense-Strategy.pdf) of 2018 and an accompanying [national security presidential memorandum](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/presidential-memorandum-support-national-biodefense/) to implement it; an [executive order to modernize influenza vaccines](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/executive-order-modernizing-influenza-vaccines-united-states-promote-national-security-public-health/); and coordinated the United States’ response to the Ebola epidemic in Congo, which was [ultimately defeated in 2020](https://www.aljazeera.com/podcasts/thetake/2020/03/ebola-outbreak-200313164537773.html).

>It is true that the Trump administration has seen fit to shrink the NSC staff. But the bloat that occurred under the previous administration clearly needed a correction. [Defense Secretary Robert Gates](https://thehill.com/opinion/national-security/465320-reducing-nsc-staff-places-trump-on-right-side-of), [congressional oversight committees](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2016/05/republicans-try-to-shrink-the-national-security-council/483596/) and members of the [Obama administration](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/how-the-obama-white-house-runs-foreign-policy/2015/08/04/2befb960-2fd7-11e5-8353-1215475949f4_story.html?tid=lk_inline_manual_10&itid=lk_inline_manual_10) itself all agreed the NSC was too large and too operationally focused (a departure from its traditional role coordinating executive branch activity). As The Post [reported](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/how-the-obama-white-house-runs-foreign-policy/2015/08/04/2befb960-2fd7-11e5-8353-1215475949f4_story.html?tid=lk_inline_manual_10&itid=lk_inline_manual_10) in 2015, from the Clinton administration to the Obama administration’s second term, the NSC’s staff “had quadrupled in size, to nearly 400 people.” That is why Trump began streamlining the NSC staff in 2017.

>One such move at the NSC was to create the counterproliferation and biodefense directorate, which was the result of consolidating three directorates into one, given the obvious overlap between arms control and nonproliferation, weapons of mass destruction terrorism, and global health and biodefense. It is this reorganization that critics have misconstrued or intentionally misrepresented. If anything, the combined directorate was stronger because related expertise could be commingled.

>The [reduction of force in the NSC](https://www.latimes.com/politics/story/2020-02-12/white-house-quietly-trims-dozens-of-national-security-experts) has continued since I departed the White House. But it has left the biodefense staff unaffected — perhaps a recognition of the importance of that mission to the president, who, after all, in 2018 issued a [presidential memorandum](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/presidential-memorandum-support-national-biodefense/) to finally create real accountability in the federal government’s expansive biodefense system.

>The NSC is really the only place in government where there is a staff that ensures the commander in chief gets all the options he needs to make a decision, and then makes sure that decision is actually implemented. I worry that further reductions at the NSC could impair its capabilities, but the current staffing level is fully up to the job.

> You might ask: Why does all this matter? Won’t it just be a historical footnote?

>It matters because when people play politics in the middle of a crisis, we are all less safe.

>We are less safe because public servants are distracted when they are dragged into politics.

>We’re less safe because the American people have been recklessly scared into doubting the competence of their government to help keep them safe, secure and healthy.

>And we’re less safe because when we’re focused on political gamesmanship, we’re not paying enough attention to the real issues. For example, we should be united behind ensuring that, in a future congressional appropriations package, U.S. companies are encouraged to return to our shores from China the production of everything from [medical face masks and personal protective equipment to vitamin C and penicillin](https://www.sbc.senate.gov/public/_cache/files/1/c/1c39a1bc-f22c-4178-951e-29b92dcb2182/3AD9C94FB267763A83913E2303A6A772.gibson-testimony.pdf).



>And we should be united in demanding to know why the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) was aware of the coronavirus outbreak in Wuhan early in [December](https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/events-as-they-happen), maybe even [November](https://www.scmp.com/news/china/society/article/3074991/coronavirus-chinas-first-confirmed-covid-19-case-traced-back), and didn’t tell the rest of the world, when stopping the deadly spread might have been possible.


>Just as the United States has fought against fake information aimed at our elections, we should fight back against CCP propagandists. They are not only campaigning against the use of the term “[Wuhan virus](https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/opinion/calling-coronavirus-wuhan-virus-isnt-racist-but-china-wants-you-to-think-it-is)” (a more geographically accurate description than “Spanish flu” ever was about the 1918 pandemic) but now also promoting the false claim that covid-19 was [created by the U.S. Army](https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/13/asia/china-coronavirus-us-lijian-zhao-intl-hnk/index.html). Public health officials have pinpointed a [wild-animal market](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/asia_pacific/china-bans-wild-animal-trade-until-coronavirus-epidemic-eliminated/2020/01/26/0e05a964-4017-11ea-971f-4ce4f94494b4_story.html?tid=lk_inline_manual_28&itid=lk_inline_manual_28) in Wuhan as the outbreak’s origin.

>There are real threats emanating from this pandemic. We need to focus on getting our response right and save the finger-pointing for what comes after. This is the United States — we will get through this. And for the love of God, wash your hands."

The Rockefeller Republicans, also called Moderate or Liberal Republicans, were members of the Republican Party (GOP) in the 1930s–1970s who held moderate to liberal views on domestic issues, similar to those of Nelson Rockefeller, Governor of New York (1959–1973) and Vice President of the United States (1974–1977). Rockefeller Republicans were most common in the Northeast and the West Coast with their larger liberal constituencies while they were rare in the South and Midwest. They often saw themselves as champions of ""good government"", contrasting themselves to the often corrupt machine politics of the Democratic Party, particularly in large cities.

Rockefeller Republicanism has been described as the last phase of the ""Eastern Establishment"" of the GOP which had been led by New York governor Thomas E. Dewey.

 Prime Minister Rutte addresses the country about the corona virus.

 Afbeelding Enlarge image



 Image: © ANP / Robin van Lonkhuijsen

 Good evening,

 The corona virus is gripping our country.

 Us and the rest of the world.

 Together we are faced with a task of enormous size.

 Many people will recognize the feeling that we have been on a rollercoaster in recent weeks that seems to be getting faster and faster.

 You wonder: is this really happening?

 Because the measures taken here and elsewhere are unprecedented for peacetime countries.

 At the beginning of this speech, I would like to express my condolences to the families of those who have since died of the virus.

 I wish everyone who is in the hospital or who is recovering at home, I wish them a lot of improvement and strength.

 And I want to address the elderly and those with poor health.

 I realize that you are very concerned.

 And that is why I want to tell you that our absolute priority is to minimize the risks for you.

 With all the news from home and abroad, with all events that follow each other at breakneck speed, it makes perfect sense that there are very broad concerns in society.

 We all have questions.

 What can I do to protect myself and those around me?

 What about school and work?

 Can a children's party continue?  A family weekend?  A wedding?

 How long will this all take?

 And why does one country take different measures than another?

 The reality is that the coronavirus is among us and will remain with us for the time being.

 In today's world, news and information are faster than light and an opinion is also given quickly.

 I understand that.

 But the answer to all the questions that come to life starts with the knowledge and experience of experts.

 Let us hold on to that.

 To experts such as Jaap van Dissel and his colleagues inside and outside RIVM.

 Virologists, intensive care physicians and other specialists.

 From the beginning, their advice has guided all measures that have been taken in the Netherlands so far.

 And it is important that we continue to rely on that compass of scientific knowledge and reliable facts.

 That is the only sensible way to continue taking the necessary steps.

 Steps that inevitably come our way.

 Because I don't have an easy message for you tonight.

 The reality is that the coronavirus is among us and will remain with us for the time being.

 There is no easy or quick way out of this very difficult situation.

 The reality is that in the near future a large part of the Dutch population will be infected with the virus.

 That's what the experts are telling us now.

 And whatever they tell us is that, pending a vaccine or drug, we can slow down the spread of the virus while building controlled group immunity.

 I have to explain that.

 Those who have had the virus are usually immune afterwards.

 Just like in the old days with measles.

 The larger the group that is immune, the less chance that the virus will jump to vulnerable elderly people and people with poor health.

 With group immunity you build, as it were, a protective wall around them.

 That is the principle.

 But we have to realize that it can take months or even longer to build up group immunity and during that time we need to shield people at greater risk as much as possible.

 Overall, there are three possible scenarios.

 The first scenario is: maximally checking the virus.

 This leads to controlled distribution among groups that are least at risk.

 That is the scenario of our choice.

 Maximum control means that we try to use measures to smooth out the peak in the number of infections and spread it over a longer period.

 Maximum control means that we try to use measures to smooth out the peak in the number of infections and spread it over a longer period.

 With this approach in which most people will only get minor complaints, we build immunity and ensure that healthcare can handle it.

 With the aim that the nursing homes, home care, hospitals and especially intensive care units are not overloaded.

 So that there is always sufficient capacity to help the people who are most vulnerable.

 The second scenario is that we let the virus run unchecked.

 This would completely overload our health care system at the peak of infection, leaving insufficient capacity to help frail elderly and other high-risk patients.

 We must of course prevent that at all costs.

 The third scenario is that we endlessly try to stop the virus.

 That means that the country is completely locked.

 Such a rigorous approach may seem attractive at first sight, but experts point out that it certainly wouldn't be a matter of days or weeks.

 In that scenario, we would actually have to shut down our country for a year or even longer, with all its consequences.

 And if it were practically possible - to let people leave their homes with permission only for so long - then the virus could immediately re-emerge if the measures were withdrawn.

 The Netherlands is an open country and as long as there is no vaccine, the coronavirus will continue to spread through the world like a wave and not skip our country.

 All advice so far, all measures previously announced are aimed at the first scenario of ""maximum control"".

 From the relatively simple guidelines not to shake hands, wash hands more often and keep a meter and a half away from far-reaching measures such as prohibiting larger meetings and closing the catering industry.

 And of course we keep our finger on the pulse every day.

 How long the measures are needed and whether more is needed therefore depends on how the virus will behave in the coming weeks and months.

 And of any new scientific insights, because the research is ongoing.

 It may be that some measures can be relaxed, but that we sometimes have to take an extra step to prevent the virus from spreading unrestrainedly.

 It will continue to fit and measure in the coming months.

 It continues to search for the balance between taking the necessary measures and allowing ordinary life to continue as much as possible.

 If we can control the spread of the virus in this way, the public health consequences are ultimately the most manageable.

 At the same time, we cannot and will not close our eyes to the economic consequences of this crisis.

 Many people are concerned about their jobs.

 Because for many companies, large and small, this is an extremely difficult period.

 A lot of entrepreneurs suddenly have their backs against the wall.

 The lady of the coffee shop on the corner, the flower grower, the transport operator, the freelancer, but it also applies to national icons such as KLM.

 My message to the entrepreneurs of the Netherlands and their employees is this: the cabinet will do what it takes to support you.

 We are committed to ensuring that businesses do not fall over by what is happening now and that people are not losing their jobs.

 Either way, it will be a difficult time, but we will not let you down.

 Finally, I would like to thank everyone in the Netherlands for the way in which the directions and measures have been followed so far and for all the heartwarming examples of mutual aid and solidarity.

 It is good to see that we are ready for each other when the need is man.

 Keep doing that.

 Stay alert and follow the directions, even if you are strong and healthy, for the benefit of people who are more vulnerable.

 That is really important.

 Continue to use your common sense and listen to the experts.

 Continue to help each other where possible.

 This is a time when we need to find each other, over disagreements and contradictions.

 A time to put the common interest above self-interest.

 And a time to give space and confidence to all those people who work in hectic conditions day and night to help others and keep the virus under control.

 Cleaners, nurses and doctors in hospitals and elderly care, general practitioners and GGD employees, police officers, ambulance personnel and all other care providers.

 To them, and to all those people who stay in their jobs in schools, childcare, public transport, supermarkets and anywhere else, I want to say: you are doing a fantastic job - thank you very much for that.

 I would like to end with this appeal: with all the uncertainties out there, one thing is absolutely clear: the task we are facing is very big and we really have to do this with 17 million people.

 Together we will overcome this difficult period.

 Pay a little attention to each other.

 I count on you.

 Thank you."""

For Immediate Release
March 16, 2020
https://www.usg.edu/coronavirus
The University System of Georgia (USG) has decided that all 26 institutions will move to online instruction for all courses for the remainder of the semester with extremely limited exceptions. This action comes following last week’s decision to suspend instruction for two weeks to ensure business and instructional continuity, and to allow further state assessment of COVID-19.
Students are not allowed to return to campus until they receive permission from their institution, which will be forthcoming soon.
Additionally, residence halls will be closed, with minimal exceptions for students unable to return home, or who cannot find housing elsewhere. Students will receive specific instructions from campus leaders regarding when they will be allowed to return to campus to retrieve their belongings from residence halls. Students must follow those instructions. For those students who are unable to depart campus, we will make every effort to accommodate these students. 
USG will be providing guidance to campuses on refunds for housing, dining, and other services. Students should wait for their campus to contact them.
Institutions will remain open, with minimal staff physically on-site, to ensure continuity of certain services.
In the end, we want to ensure that our faculty, staff and students are safe; that we do our part to help stem the spread of the coronavirus in Georgia; and that we fulfill our mission to graduate our students even in the face of these challenging times."

Week 1: Grieve like the relationship was there and the break up was a traditional breakup. Allow yourself to wallow and be sad and eat a gallon of chocolate ice cream while binging romcoms and chick flicks and ugly cry. Stop contacting him immediately. 

Week 2: hard stop of week 1 after seven days. Pick up the bag after a week and start carrying on. Let the weight slowly fade on its own. Process it and tell yourself this sucks and it’s okay to hurt. Don’t be hard on yourself. Take the time to block his social media, and delete the photos. If you want to keep them, upload them to a google drive or something and then delete them from your camera roll. Don’t keep them instantly accessible. You don’t have to do this all in one day. Don’t overdo it. If you’re catching yourself wanting to wallow again, go outside and get some fresh air and call or text a close friend. Cry if you need to but don’t let yourself cry for hours. Talk about it openly and freely, don’t worry about formalities. 

Week 3: make an effort to hit up friends to hang out and be around other people. If the coronavirus thing still is going on during this week, then try watching a new movie or show on Netflix or Disney. Something you’ve never seen and never imagined yourself watching. Do it with at least one friend if at all possible. Start trying to resteer your thoughts in a more positive direction but don’t be hard on yourself for still hurting. Acknowledge when you hurt and then do something to counter it. 

Week 4: continue with week 3 and add on trying to find a new hobby or go out by yourself. Even if it’s to the bookstore a few hours. Dress nicely and go have fun. Do things alone and actively work on not thinking about the situation. Put it behind you best you can. 

Week 5: start putting the whole thing behind you. You don’t have to start dating again but push forward your hardest here. This week officially makes at least a month and while it’s still 300% okay to not be ready to move on, make an action to start preparing to open yourself back up. Go over yourself: how do you feel? Are you moving on? If the answer is no and you feel stuck, try seeking professional help to process. If the answer is yes, start getting yourself ready to get back in the game. 

Week 6: if by this point you still feel stuck and super sad about it, and are experiencing feelings of worthlessness and self doubt, seek help definitely. Therapists are there to help you. If you are feeling a bit better, start evaluating yourself. After this, what did you learn? What did you do really well? Where are there things to improve on? How does this affect my standards going forward? How can I avoid making this mistake again? Am I prepared to move on after this? Also ask yourself questions about him. What did I see in him? What about him will I avoid in others? What red flags did I not see? What green flags did I see? If you can’t figure it out mentally, write the questions down and put them somewhere visible. After this, you should feel okay to move on after a couple more weeks or months. You’ll feel your confidence grow and you’ll be back in the game again."

And now you have all these edgy twitter personalities talking about how great coronavirus is because it is a “boomer remover”. This generation isn’t better than any other generation before it and the hope we have for the future is misguided. Seeing how upset the most environmentally friendly generation got to having to cancel trips (tourism industry is horrible for the environment) shows that we only care about things that don’t affect our fun. 

At the end of the day the people I interact with only seem to support doing the right thing if it doesn’t impact their fun at the moment it impacts their fun they don’t care about doing the right thing anymore."

If I'm understanding this right, there are two ways to get tested for Covid-19 right now:

1. You have to say you were in contact with someone you know has tested positive for coronavirus.
2. Failing that, you have to have severe symptoms, get admitted into a hospital, and then you get tested.

In Elba's video, he said he was in contact with someone who tested positive, and that's why he got tested. That corroborates what Goldman said."

&#x200B;

Good evening,  The corona virus is gripping our country.  Us and the rest of the world.  Together we are faced with a task of enormous size.  Many people will recognize the feeling that we have been on a rollercoaster in recent weeks that seems to be getting faster and faster.  You wonder: is this really happening?  Because the measures taken here and elsewhere are unprecedented for peacetime countries.  At the beginning of this speech, I would like to express my condolences to the families of those who have since died of the virus.  I wish everyone who is in the hospital or who is recovering at home, I wish them a lot of improvement and strength.  And I want to address the elderly and those with poor health.  I realize that you are very concerned.  And that is why I want to tell you that our absolute priority is to minimize the risks for you.  With all the news from home and abroad, with all events that follow each other at breakneck speed, it makes perfect sense that there are very broad concerns in society.  We all have questions.  What can I do to protect myself and those around me?  What about school and work?  Can a children's party continue? A family weekend? A wedding?  How long will this all take?  And why does one country take different measures than another?  In today's world, news and information are faster than light and an opinion is also given quickly.  I understand that.

But the answer to all the questions that come to life starts with the knowledge and experience of experts.  Let us hold on to that.  To experts such as Jaap van Dissel and his colleagues inside and outside RIVM.  Virologists, intensive care physicians and other specialists.  From the beginning, their advice has guided all measures that have been taken in the Netherlands so far.  And it is important that we continue to rely on that compass of scientific knowledge and reliable facts.  That is the only sensible way to continue taking the necessary steps.  Steps that inevitably come our way.  Because I don't have an easy message for you tonight.  The reality is that the coronavirus is among us and will remain among us for the time being.  There is no easy or quick way out of this very difficult situation.  The reality is also that a large part of the Dutch population will become infected with the virus in the near future.  That's what the experts are telling us now.  And whatever they tell us is that, pending a vaccine or drug, we can slow down the spread of the virus while building controlled group immunity.  I have to explain that.  Those who have had the virus are usually immune afterwards.  Just like in the old days with measles.  The larger the group that is immune, the less likely the virus is to jump to vulnerable elderly people and people with poor health.  With group immunity you build, as it were, a protective wall around them.  That is the principle.  But we must realize that it can take months or even longer to build group immunity, and during that time we need to shield people at greater risk as much as possible.  Overall, there are three possible scenarios.  The first scenario is: maximally checking the virus.  This leads to a controlled distribution, among groups that are least at risk.  That is the scenario of our choice.  Maximum control means that we try to use measures to smooth out the peak in the number of infections and spread it over a longer period.  With this approach in which most people will only get minor complaints, we build immunity and ensure that healthcare can handle it.  With the aim that the nursing homes, home care, hospitals and especially intensive care units are not overloaded.  So that there is always sufficient capacity to help the people who are most vulnerable.  The second scenario is that we let the virus run unchecked.  This would completely overload our healthcare system at the peak of contamination, leaving insufficient capacity to help frail elderly and other high-risk patients.

We must of course prevent that at all costs.  The third scenario is that we endlessly try to stop the virus.  That means that the country is completely locked.  Such a rigorous approach may seem attractive at first sight, but experts point out that it certainly wouldn't be a matter of days or weeks.  In that scenario, we would actually have to shut down our country for a year or even longer, with all its consequences.  And if it were practically possible - to let people leave their homes with permission only for so long - then the virus could immediately re-emerge if the measures were withdrawn.  The Netherlands is an open country and as long as there is no vaccine, the coronavirus will continue to spread through the world like a wave and not skip our country.  All advice so far, all measures previously announced are aimed at the first scenario of ""maximum control"".  From the relatively simple guidelines not to shake hands, wash hands more often and keep a meter and a half away from far-reaching measures such as prohibiting larger meetings and closing the catering industry.  And of course we keep our finger on the pulse every day.  How long the measures are needed and whether more is needed therefore depends on how the virus will behave in the coming weeks and months.  And of any new scientific insights, because the research is ongoing.  It may be that some measures can be relaxed, but that we sometimes have to take an extra step to prevent the virus from spreading unrestrainedly.  It will continue to fit and measure in the coming months.  It continues to search for the balance between taking the necessary measures and allowing ordinary life to continue as much as possible.  If we can control the spread of the virus in this way, the public health consequences are ultimately the most manageable.  At the same time, we cannot and will not close our eyes to the economic consequences of this crisis.  Many people are concerned about their jobs.  Because for many companies, large and small, this is an extremely difficult period.  A lot of entrepreneurs suddenly have their backs against the wall.  The lady of the coffee shop on the corner, the flower grower, the transport operator, the freelancer, but it also applies to national icons such as KLM.  My message to the entrepreneurs of the Netherlands and their employees is this: the cabinet will do what it takes to support you.  We are committed to ensuring that businesses do not fall over by what is happening now and that people are not losing their jobs.

Either way, it will be a difficult time, but we will not let you down.  Finally, I would like to thank everyone in the Netherlands for the way in which the directions and measures have been followed so far and for all the heartwarming examples of mutual aid and solidarity.  It is good to see that we are ready for each other when the need is man.  Keep doing that.  Stay alert and follow the directions, even if you are strong and healthy, for the benefit of people who are more vulnerable.  That is really important.  Continue to use your common sense and listen to the experts.  Continue to help each other where possible.  This is a time when we need to find each other, over disagreements and contradictions.  A time to put the common interest above self-interest.  And a time to give space and confidence to all those people who work in hectic conditions day and night to help others and keep the virus under control.  Cleaners, nurses and doctors in hospitals and elderly care, general practitioners and GGD employees, police officers, ambulance personnel and all other care providers.  To them, and to all those people who stay in their jobs in schools, childcare, public transport, supermarkets and anywhere else, I want to say: you are doing a fantastic job - thank you very much for that.  I would like to end with this appeal: with all the uncertainties out there, one thing is absolutely clear: the task we are facing is very big and we really have to do this with 17 million people.  Together we will overcome this difficult period.  Pay a little attention to each other.  I count on you.  Thank you."

A Phoenix man who recently tested positive for the new coronavirus described an arduous process in getting tested despite being in direct contact with someone who had already been diagnosed with the virus.

Andrei ""Drei"" Marghitas said he started noticing flu-like symptoms several days after attending a birthday party on Feb. 29.

Marghitas said that at the party he shook hands and hugged [a man who later posted a public video saying he was the second confirmed coronavirus case in Arizona](https://www.azcentral.com/story/news/local/scottsdale-breaking/2020/03/07/man-posts-youtube-video-he-has-coronavirus-likely-arizona-case/4970372002/). 

Despite having contact with a confirmed case, Marghitas told The Arizona Republic that getting tested for the new coronavirus was difficult. 

""Whenever I reached out to primary-care physicians, they would tell me to reach out to the emergency room,"" Marghitas told The Republic. ""The emergency room said they wouldn't take me."""

Willie Walsh, head of IAG, will *postpone his retirement* to steer the group through the health emergency. Announcing a 75 per cent reduction in capacity over the next two months, Mr Walsh said there was no guarantee that many European airlines would survive. “The situation is going to be quite dynamic in the next few weeks,” he said. “There are many airlines out there who are severely stressed with little or no cash resources.” There was no guarantee that many European airlines would survive, he said.

A patient who has tested positive for COVID-19 had previously been to two Northeast Georgia Health System facilities for treatment, beginning March 4, and was discharged without COVID-19 testing, with the hospital noting the patient’s symptoms did not require testing, according to an email sent March 15 by Carol Burrell, president and CEO of NGHS, and obtained by The Times.

The email was directed to system employees and obtained by The Times from multiple sources.

Hospital officials were unavailable Monday afternoon to comment about the email but additional information may be available later today.

The patient first visited Northeast Georgia Medical Center Braselton’s emergency department on March 4, and according to the email, symptoms at the time did not show a need for coronavirus testing, and the patient was discharged. Guidelines have focused in part on patient travel history. The patient then went to the Northeast Georgia Physicians Group urgent care location in Braselton on March 10, and according to the email, symptoms at the time again did not show a need for coronavirus testing. The patient was then discharged from the urgent care.

On March 12, the patient went to a primary care provider who is not employed by NGHS, and that provider ordered a COVID-19 test, according to the email. That test came back positive Sunday, March 15.

Tests in the state have been limited, with Gov. Brian Kemp stating Saturday during a press conference that the state can process 100 per day. He hopes to double that by the end of this week. Kemp also said local transmission was evident and he encouraged social distancing, which includes avoiding gatherings and keeping a safe distance of as many as 6 feet from others.

According to the email, NGHS leadership is contacting staff in departments and areas that were potentially exposed to the virus by the patient’s visits to NGHS facilities.

“More details are being shared with employees in those areas about what next steps they need to take,” Burrell wrote. “At this point, all employees who are asymptomatic are expected to report for all scheduled shifts as planned per CDC guidelines.”

NGMC Braselton is treating two patients who have tested positive for COVID-19. It was not clear whether that includes the patient who began seeking treatment March 4."

While the Chinese government is undoubtedly doing very sketchy things to discourage uprising and combat the HK protests, the ""theory"" that COVID-19 was both developed in a lab and developed for the purposes of being used as a bioweapon are simply not supported by any solid evidence. The whole thing was greatly perpetuated by [this article](https://nypost.com/2020/02/22/dont-buy-chinas-story-the-coronavirus-may-have-leaked-from-a-lab/) in the *New York Post*, a source that has [a very mixed record of factuality](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/new-york-post/), and is owned by News Corp, whose other subsidiaries like Fox News have often garnered criticism for [prioritizing emotions and sensationalism over concrete reporting](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/fox-news/), and who also owns [STAR TV](https://www.nytimes.com/1993/08/23/business/the-media-business-star-tv-extends-murdoch-s-reach.html), a Hong Kong-based media outlet, which signifies a direct stake for the company [\[a breakdown of the article's reasoning can be found here\]](https://www.the-scientist.com/news-opinion/theory-that-coronavirus-escaped-from-a-lab-lacks-evidence-67229). While I'm not trying to defend China at all, it is worth pointing out that trying to point fingers in the middle of an outbreak like this serves very little purpose other than to further divide. As for the bat soup thing, there was a lot of potentially deliberate exaggeration and fearmongering involved. The two major outlets that initially spread the idea were the *Daily Mail* through [this article](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-7920573/Revolting-footage-shows-Chinese-woman-eating-bat-scientists-link-coronavirus-animal.html), and *RT*, through [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZsFHu-AaGQ) (be careful; the footage could be rather disturbing to some people, as it does still very much include a bat being consumed). On top of the immediate issue with the headline including the word ""revolting"", delivering a judgement before the reader can form their own opinion, the *Daily Mail* has a rather unfavorable reputation. [It was even marked as a non-reliable source for use in Wikipedia articles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daily_Mail). [AllSides.com](https://AllSides.com) marks it as having an [extreme right bias](https://www.allsides.com/news-source/daily-mail), which already diminishes its reliability as a news source, even if it didn't have a [rather low rate of factual reporting](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/daily-mail/). *RT* has a lot of problems of its own, not least of which is the fact that it is [operated by the Russian government](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RT_(TV_network)). The video itself is highly problematic. One thing of note was that it wasn't taken in Wuhan, where bats aren't even considered a delicacy in the slightest. [It isn't even from China in the first place](https://foreignpolicy.com/2020/01/27/dont-blame-bat-soup-for-the-wuhan-virus/). The woman shown *is* Chinese; her name is Wang Mengyun, the host of a popular travel webshow in China, but the video was taken in Palau, both far away from where the outbreak began, and completely independent from any incident involving the disease. The only link was the timing; the first cases were being reported when she posted the episode. In short, do your research, don't fall for sensationalism, and be rational. It is acutely upsetting to me that, in light of this pandemic, instead of trying to come up with viable solutions, our first move was find someone to blame."

I.e., when they were reporting around 140 infected. (number of people dead on this day times 99 assuming the real mortality rate is 1%).

So, that means there were around 250 as many infected. It is estimated that the spread increases by approximately 20% per day. That means there are about one million infected in Italy, right now. Rather than the 27000 cases reported.

So closer to 40x as many people are infected.

18 days (https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2020/03/12/coronavirus-kills-average-185-days/)

My local hospital announced they would open up free testing for the virus. I called to schedule an appointment, they took my info and scheduled me for a pre-screening phone appointment with a doctor. They called me back today (about 24 hours later) and after a handful of questions they said I'm not eligible to be tested because I haven't traveled internationally to a high risk area (like Italy or China) and because I haven't been in contact with ""someone with a laboratory-confirmed case of COVID-19""

The idea that the US is testing at all is a complete joke. The spread of this thing is utterly out of control at this point because the CDC insists that only people who have had confirmed contact with confirmed carriers need to be tested. Forget all the thousands (millions? probably) of people who work retail or work in large public spaces and encounter hundreds of people every day--we don't matter to the great statistics machine. 

Does the CDC truly think that over the last few weeks I've been asking every one of my customers if they have had a laboratory-confirmed case of the Coronavirus? Would the CDC even believe me if I said ""yes"" to that question?

Students are not allowed to return to campus until they receive permission from their institution, which will be forthcoming soon.
 
Additionally, residence halls will be closed, with minimal exceptions for students unable to return home, or who cannot find housing elsewhere.

""I am writing to you from Bergamo, Italy, at the heart of the coronavirus crisis. The news media in the US has not captured the severity of what is happening here. I am writing this post because each of you, today, not the government, not the school district, not the mayor, each individual citizen has the chance, today to take actions that will deter the Italian situation from becoming your own country’s reality. The only way to stop this virus is to limit contagion. And the only way to limit contagion is for millions of people to change their behavior today.

If you are in Europe or the US you are weeks away from where we are today in Italy.

I can hear you now. “It’s just a flu. It only affects old people with preconditions”

There are 2 reasons why Coronavirus has brought Italy to it’s knees. First it is a flu is devastating when people get really sick they need weeks of ICU – and, second, because of how fast and effectively it spreads. There is 2 week incubation period and many who have it never show symptoms.

When Prime Minister Conte announced last night that the entire country, 60 million people, would go on lock down, the line that struck me most was “there is no more time.” Because to be clear, this national lock down, is a hail mary. What he means is that if the numbers of contagion do not start to go down, the system, Italy, will collapse.

Why? Today the ICUs in Lombardy are at capacity – more than capacity. They have begun to put ICU units in the hallways. If the numbers do not go down, the growth rate of contagion tells us that there will be thousands of people who in a matter of a week? two weeks? who will need care. What will happen when there are 100, or a 1000 people who need the hospital and only a few ICU places left?

On Monday a doctor wrote in the paper that they have begun to have to decide who lives and who dies when the patients show up in the emergency room, like what is done in war. This will only get worse.

There are a finite number of drs, nurses, medical staff and they are getting the virus. They have also been working non-stop, non-stop for days and days. What happens when the drs, nurses and medical staff are simply not able to care for the patients, when they are not there?

And finally for those who say that this is just something that happens to old people, starting yesterday the hospitals are reporting that younger and younger patients – 40, 45, 18, are coming in for treatment.

You have a chance to make a difference and stop the spread in your country. Push for the entire office to work at home today, cancel birthday parties, and other gatherings, stay home as much as you can. If you have a fever, any fever, stay home. Push for school closures, now. Anything you can do to stop the spread, because it is spreading in your communities – there is a two week incubation period – and if you do these things now you can buy your medical system time.

And for those who say it is not possible to close the schools, and do all these other things, locking down Italy was beyond anyone’s imagination a week ago.

Soon you will not have a choice, so do what you can now.

Please share.""

On a fait des économies et on a privatisé en confondant efficacité avec gains à courts termes pour se dire libéral alors qu'on aurait pu, sans dimensionner pour des épidémies - qu'on prévoyait pourtant comme fortement probables dans les centres français d'épidémiologies ou dans les instituts spécialisés - avoir un système de santé encore plus fort, encore plus résistant.

&#x200B;

>Two fundamental strategies are possible: (a) mitigation, which focuses on slowing but not necessarily stopping epidemic spread – reducing peak healthcare demand while protecting those most at risk of severe disease from infection, and (b) suppression, which aims to reverse epidemic growth, reducing case numbers to low levels and maintaining that situation indefinitely. Each policy has major challenges.  
>  
>We find that that optimal mitigation policies (combining home isolation of suspect cases, home quarantine of those living in the same household as suspect cases, and social distancing of the elderly and others at most risk of severe disease) might reduce peak healthcare demand by 2/3 and deaths by half. However, the resulting mitigated epidemic would still likely result in hundreds of thousands of deaths and health systems (most notably intensive care units) being overwhelmed many times over.

Mitigation har effekt, men inte tillräcklig för att undvika sjukvårdskaos och massiva dödstal.

>Suppression will minimally require a combination of social distancing of the entire population, home isolation of cases and household quarantine of their family members. This may need to be supplemented by school and university closures, though it should be recognised that such closures may have negative impacts on health systems due to increased absenteeism. The major challenge of suppression is that this type of intensive intervention package \[...\] **will need to be maintained until a vaccine becomes available (potentially 18 months or more)** – given that we predict that transmission will quickly rebound if interventions are relaxed.  We show that intermittent social distancing \[...\] may allow interventions to be relaxed temporarily in relative short time windows, but measures will need to be reintroduced if or when case numbers rebound.

Suppression är mycket mer effektivt för att hindra smittan (duh), men måste genomföras oerhört länge med väldigt stora konsekvenser för samhället. Epidemiologi vs ekonomi. Ekonomi påverkar såklart i sin tur också samhällets hälsa. Dessutom måste man tänka på hur länge samhället orkar lyda restriktionerna och vilka hälsomässiga problem som kan skapas av långtgående isolering.

Pest eller kolera alltså. Vad tänker ni om framtiden?

We have a severly cut back health system, what happens when the first big wave of deaths and cases happen? The health care system is going to become flooded, we don't have the manpower or equipment to deal with this.

So what happens when the hospital is flooded with cases? They will have to triage and even then, they can't save everyone. The elderly will absolutely die to save the young, but who gets saved out of the young because of dwindling resources is where more deaths will take place.

So we have the virus patients taking priority, what happens to those with cancer treatment? Or other serious health issues?

Premier Rutte addressed the Netherlands this evening and has said that the #CoronaVirus will remain with us for the time being. ""There is no easy or quick way out of this very difficult situation. The reality is that in the near future a large part of the Dutch population will be infected with the virus.""

Most people will develop minor complaints, according to Rutte. In this way, ""herd immunity"" is built up, which is believed to be crucial to containing the virus. However this can take months and possibly even longer. Until then, we must do everything we can to protect the most vulnerable people. ""It is our absolute priority to minimise the risks for the elderly and those with poor health.""

""Many will recognise the feeling that we have been on a rollercoaster in recent weeks, which seems to be getting faster and faster. This feeling is due to the fact that the measures taken here in NL and elsewhere are unprecedented for countries in peacetime."" Rutte emphasised once again that the advice of our experts is the leading factor.

""Either way, it will be a difficult time, but we will not let you down.

According to Rutte, the government has chosen to contain the virus as much as possible and to smooth out the peak in contaminations and spread it over a longer period. In this way, immunity is built up and we ensure that our healthcare can handle it.

If the virus is left to run out of control, the healthcare system would be completely overrun. Vulnerable elderly residents and other patients could not be helped. ""We must prevent that at all costs.""

However attempts to stop the virus completely in its tracks is also not an option, said the prime minister. ""In that scenario, we should actually shut down our country for a year or even longer, with all consequences that that brings.

Rutte also reflected on the concerns that many people have about their work. ""We are doing everything we can to ensure that companies are not cut down by what is happening now and that people are not losing their jobs. It will be a difficult time anyway, but we will not let you down.""

He asked for support for cabinet measures. ""This is a time when we need to find common ground, over disagreements and contradictions. A time to put the common interest above self-interest.""

Rutte ended with a call to the nation: ""We really have to do this together with the 17 million people who live in the Netherlands. Together we will overcome this difficult time. Look out for each other. I'm counting on you.""

Sen. Kyrsten Sinema called Monday on Arizona to take far more aggressive actions than it has so far to stop the spread of the new coronavirus. 

Arizona's strategies to prevent spread of COVID-19 remain less aggressive than those taken by other states, even after Gov. Doug Ducey reversed course Sunday and ordered schools to close through the end of the month. In making her statement on Twitter, Sinema, D-Ariz., shared [an Arizona Republic story detailing Ducey's less aggressive approach. ](https://www.azcentral.com/story/news/local/arizona-health/2020/03/16/arizona-governor-doug-ducey-takes-less-aggressive-approach-coronavirus-covid-19/5055430002/) 

""Arizona can and should take action NOW to reduce spread, keep our hospitals from getting overwhelmed, and save lives,"" Sinema said in a written statement. ""It is time to temporarily close clubs, bars, museums, libraries, gyms, and other places where large groups congregate.""

Restaurants, she said, should move to pickup and delivery orders only. 

""Communities that have taken this action early have saved lives and reduced the spread of coronavirus,"" she wrote. ""Communities that haven't taken this action early have seen increased virus spread, more hospitalizations, and more deaths.""

> Our message to countries continues to be: you must take a comprehensive approach. Not testing alone. Not contact tracing alone. Not quarantine alone. Not social distancing alone. Do it all. Any country that looks at the experience of other countries with large epidemics and thinks “that won’t happen to us” is making a deadly mistake. It can happen to any country. The experience of China, the Republic of Korea, Singapore and others clearly demonstrates that aggressive testing and contact tracing, combined with social distancing measures and community mobilization, can prevent infections and save lives.

> Isolate the sick and quarantine their contacts. In addition, measures that increase social distancing such as cancelling sporting events may help to reduce transmission. These measures, of course, should be based on local context and risk assessment, and should be time-limited.

There are many good reasons to temporarily reduce gatherings of people and limit social activity. The Washington Post [has an article on the reasoning behind social distancing](https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2020/03/10/social-distancing-coronavirus/), along with another page [with further explanations and interactive simulations](https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2020/world/corona-simulator/).

I can't find the quote right now, because Google kinda sucks, but Italy has also seen a huge number of hospitalizations for people under the age of 50. ([Best source I could find.](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/coronavirus-italy-update-young-people-hospital-luca-lorini-bergamo-a9402531.html)) Everyone keeps parroting the same thing over and over, ""but this thing only kills old people!"" Even if that weren't a totally disgusting argument -- because young people can asymptomatically carry the illness and infect an older person -- it's completely missing the point that hospitals are filling up full of people from many age ranges and that's causing massive resource problems for entire health care systems.

ICUs are [filling up with covid19 patients](https://twitter.com/cbsnews/status/1239579684788207618?s=21) but car crashes, heart attacks, strokes, and other accidents are still happening. If you were a doctor, what kind of decisions would you have to make then? How would this impact your performance as a physician? [Is it possible you'd have to start choosing who gets a respirator and who doesn't?](https://old.reddit.com/r/videos/comments/fim92f/critical_care_doctor_perspective_on_covid_19/)

*That* is the point of all these closures and shutdowns and inconveniences. There are a bunch of selfish, poorly-informed people out there whose attitude is, ""*I* won't get sick, so what's the big deal?"" Since no amount of shouting seems to be working on those people, other people are being forced to make sensible decisions for them.

There's yer reasoned view, and I'm neither a cat lady, older, nor a ""5g-causes-cancer"" type."
2020-03-16,vik556,business,9,https://www.reddit.com/r/business/comments/fjnokx/dont_feel_sorry_for_the_airlines/fko869d/,"For American Airlines, the nation’s largest airline, the mid to late 2010s were what the Bible calls “years of plenty.”

In 2014, having reduced competition through mergers and raised billions of dollars in new baggage-fee revenue, American began reaching stunning levels of financial success. In 2015, it posted a $7.6 billion profit — compared, for example, to profits of about $500 million in 2007 and less than $250 million in 2006. It would continue to earn billions in profit annually for the rest of the decade. “I don’t think we’re ever going to lose money again,” the company’s chief executive, Doug Parker, said in 2017.

There are plenty of things American could have done with all that money. It could have stored up its cash reserves for a future crisis, knowing that airlines regularly cycle through booms and busts. It might have tried to decisively settle its continuing contract disputes with pilots, flight attendants and mechanics. It might have invested heavily in better service quality to try to repair its longstanding reputation as the worst of the major carriers.

Instead, American blew most of its cash on a stock buyback spree. From 2014 to 2020, in an attempt to increase its earnings per share, American spent more than $15 billion buying back its own stock. It managed, despite the risk of the proverbial rainy day, to shrink its cash reserves. At the same time it was blowing cash on buybacks, American also began to borrow heavily to finance the purchase of new planes and the retrofitting of old planes to pack in more seats. As early as 2017 analysts warned of a risk of default should the economy deteriorate, but American kept borrowing. It has now accumulated a debt of nearly $30 billion, nearly five times the company’s current market value.

At no time during its years of plenty did American improve how it treats its customers. Change fees went up to $200 for domestic flights and to $750 for international. Its widely despised baggage fees were hiked to $30 and $40 for first and second bags. These higher fees yielded billions of dollars, yet did not help the airline improve its on-time arrivals, reduce tarmac delays or prevent involuntary bumping. Instead, American’s main “innovations” were the removal of screens from its planes, the reduction of bathroom and seat sizes and the introduction of a “basic economy” class that initially included a ban on carry-on luggage.

In the wake of the coronavirus outbreak, which is wreaking havoc on the airline industry, American Airlines has not yet asked for a bailout — at least not in so many words. Yet after a recent meeting with airline leadership, Larry Kudlow, the director of the National Economic Council, said that “certain sectors of the economy, airlines coming to mind” might require assistance. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said Wednesday that the airlines, including American, would be “on the top of the list” for federal loan relief.
DEBATABLEAgree to disagree, or disagree better? Broaden your perspective with sharp arguments on the most pressing issues of the week. Sign up here.
As the government considers what we, the public, should do for the airlines, we should ask, Just what have they done for us?


The United States economy needs an airline industry to function. The industry is in that sense not a “normal” industry, but rather what was once called a common carrier or a public utility: a critical infrastructure on which the rest of the economy relies. The major airlines know that unlike a local restaurant, they will never be allowed, collectively, to fail completely. In practice, the public has subsidized the industry by providing de facto insurance against hard times in the form of bailouts or merger approvals. And now here we go again.
We cannot permit American and other airlines to use federal assistance, whether labeled a bailout or not, to weather the coronavirus crisis and then return to business as usual. Before providing any loan relief, tax breaks or cash transfers, we must demand that the airlines change how they treat their customers and employees and make basic changes in industry ownership structure.


Beginning with passengers, change fees should be capped at $50 and baggage fees tied to some ratio of costs. The change fees don’t just irritate; they are also a drag on the broader economy, making the transport system less flexible and discouraging what would otherwise be efficient changes to travel plans. We should also put an end to the airlines’ pursuit of smaller and smaller seats, which are not only uncomfortable and even physically harmful, but also foster in-flight rage and make the job of flight attendants nigh unbearable. Finally, we have allowed too much common ownership, permitting large shareholders to take a stake in each of the major airlines, creating incentives to collude instead of compete.

The airlines will argue that their ownership structure, cramped seats, high fees and other forms of customer suffering are necessary to keep prices lower. But after the last decade’s mergers, no one should take that argument seriously. As any economist will tell you, in a market with reduced competition, and common ownership, there is limited pressure to reduce prices. Instead, as we’ve seen, the major airlines charge what they can get away with and spend the profit on stock buybacks and other self-serving enterprises.


The question of what the public should demand from an airline bailout raises questions that transcend the business of flying. The next several weeks will leave behind many economic victims, including nearly every provider of in-person services. Many small retailers, restaurants and other businesses, like caterers or fitness instructors, face grim prospects. Yet it is the economy’s big players, like banks and airlines, that are the best at asking for (and getting) government assistance.

During the last economic crisis, we largely let individuals suffer while helping out the big guys, leaving behind deep resentments that still fester. This time around we should start from the bottom instead of the top."

Part of what factors in the decision is your response to all this.

You say you are ""now very aware I screwed up"", however, a a bunch of other things you are saying really indicate to me that you are now very aware that you are in trouble, but not really very aware that 1) this was on you and 2) that it is academic dishonesty and why that would have actual consequences .

Here are some quotes that you should really re-think

>(The department had apparently also sent an email mentioning we weren’t allowed to resubmit our previous work for retake courses, which my professor noted in her email citing the fact she’d “likely” report me for this.)

Here and elsewhere is looks like you are trying to deflect responsibility for realizing this was not ok.

>As if there was ever an ideal time to get in very serious academic trouble, I’m also working in one of the industries (schools, but as an hourly worker) that’s about to get absolutely SCREWED by coronavirus. I’m going to be at the poverty line the foreseeable future,

This is the sympathy vote play, and invoking this now is not a good look.  10 Assignments ago, this was not a factor.  Your decisions then are going to make a tragic and unfortunate effect of a global pandemic even worse for you, but this was not going on then.  We all get that the punitive results we mete out for cheating are onerous and suck for you.  They wouldn't really be punitive if there were no consequences.  You really shouldn't go there.

>I will do anything at this point simply not to be expelled for something I feel is minor,

This is really not minor.  Here and elsewhere you downplay the offense.  So it really does not look like you actually learned your lesson, only that you don't want to be in this position.  Not the same things.

>my professor has some clear albeit minimal evidence that I copied and pasted my prior work (a very small amount of identical tiny typos, for example)

Again, downplaying and looks like you are deflecting that the evidence isn't really good.  You did it.  She knows you did it.


Your approach to this should be to take a real look at why such things are prohibited, what mental outlook and decisions you made that led up to this, and what you would do to make sure you didn't make a morally questionable choice given the same motivations again, and how you would recognize that the choice was lacking integrity."

My mom forwarded it to me and I was absolutely floored. People are going to die because of this.

From the church:

IMPORTANT ANNOUNCEMENT - CORONAVIRUS:
1. If you have a runny nose and sputum, you have a common cold.
2. Coronavirus pneumonia is a dry cough with no runny nose. 
3. This new virus is not heat-resistant and will be killed by a temperature of just 26/27 degrees C. (About 77 degrees F.) It hates the Sun. 
4. If someone sneezes with it, it goes about 10 feet before it drops to the ground and is no longer airborne. 
5. If it drops on a metal surface it will live for at least 12 hours - so if you come into contact with any metal surface, wash your hands as soon as you can with a bacterial soap. 
6. On fabric it can survive for 6-12 hours. normal laundry detergent will kill it. 
7. Drinking warm water is effective for all viruses. Try not to drink liquids with ice. 
8. Wash your hands frequently as the virus can only live on your hands for 5-10 minutes, but - a lot can happen during that time - you can rub your eyes, pick your nose unwittingly and so on. 
9. You should also gargle as a prevention. A simple solution of salt in warm water will suffice. 
10. Can't emphasis enough - drink plenty of water! 

I HAVE ALSO HEARD THAT YOU CAN PUT SHOES, COATS, ETC. IN THE SUN AFTER YOU'VE BEEN OUT AND DON'T HAVE TIME OR ENERGY TO LAUNDER.   AS STATED ABOVE, THE VIRUS HATES THE SUN.

Student mailing list does not get all updates and usually does not receive updates first 🤷‍♀️

To all members of the University of Calgary community:

 

This afternoon the University of Calgary was made aware that a member of our community has tested positive for COVID-19 (coronavirus).

 

This individual, who has not been on campus since March 9, was based in the science precinct of the university and their case is believed to be travel connected at this time. This individual did everything right: the moment they felt ill, they self-isolated and called 811 to be tested. As a result, they were not on campus while exhibiting symptoms. Communicable disease experts believe the risk of additional transmission was significantly reduced by these actions. Cleaning actions will further reduce transmission risk and we have closed the particular facilities associated with this individual until further notice.

 

I understand this might raise your level of concern for being on campus.

 

For students, we will accelerate our transfer of student services to alternate delivery. While we will try to ensure minimal disruptions, I ask that you be patient with us tomorrow as services transition.

 

For faculty and staff, we will support those of you who make the decision to work from home. If your work requires you to be physically present, we will provide extra training to enhance your safety and increase social distancing measures. We also support any decision made by those of you who are immunocompromised or who live with immunocompromised individuals to stay off campus. Please work with your supervisors on any such plans.

 

The best defence against COVID-19 continues to be the types of preventative measures available to all of us: wash your hands, avoid handshakes, cough into your arm and stay home when you are sick. COVID-19 will be with our community for the foreseeable future. By taking these measures and looking out for ourselves, we are looking out for each other and helping protect the most vulnerable among us.

 

The University of Calgary remains open and we will continue to provide services to our community, albeit much of it through remote delivery. We sincerely appreciate your support and patience, and we will continue to keep you up to date on COVID-19 developments on campus.

 

Sincerely,

 

Dr. Ed McCauley"

### How does coronavirus transmission compare with flu? [Update 3/13/2020]

[In a press briefing](https://www.who.int/dg/speeches/detail/who-director-general-s-opening-remarks-at-the-media-briefing-on-covid-19---3-march-2020) on March 3, WHO Director-General Dr. Tedros emphasized that “this virus is not SARS, it’s not MERS, and it’s not influenza. It is a unique virus with unique characteristics.”

“Both COVID-19 and influenza cause respiratory disease and spread the same way, via small droplets of fluid from the nose and mouth of someone who is sick,” he said. “However… COVID-19 does not transmit as efficiently as influenza, from the data we have so far. With influenza, people who are infected but not yet sick are major drivers of transmission, which does not appear to be the case for COVID-19.”

While media reports have widely circulated fears that asymptomatic people are silently spreading COVID-19 around communities and countries, there is little data to back that up. In fact, asymptomatic cases appear rare and potentially misclassified. Dr. Tedros noted that only 1 percent of cases in China are reported as “asymptomatic.” And of that 1 percent, 75 percent do go on to develop symptoms.

Though it is still unclear to what extent infected people may spread the virus *before* developing symptoms, the WHO still reports that, based on the current data, the biggest drivers of COVID-19 spread are symptomatic people coughing and sneezing.

Moreover, the thrust of the epidemic in China has been from the spread of the virus through households and close contacts, not unconnected community members."

Whether or not you are in an area with few cases or whether or not you are personally not of demographic categories that make it high risk for you are not relevant.

Maybe you get it and spread it to your friends, but they are all young and healthy and fine. Now they can spread it to everyone they come in contact with, which may include the old or the immuno-compromised. So you can say ""well, I'll never come in contact with any at-risk people"", but will the people you contact? And what about the people they contact? Is it not easier for everyone if you do the things you need to do to never have it in the first place? Or at best, delay when you get it so that those tertiary contacts who are at risk have a staffed and well-resourced health care system that can treat them?

2020-03-16,KinnerNevada,Coronavirus,9,https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/fjq1o9/italys_coronavirus_victims_face_death_alone_with/fkocdjv/,"ROME — At around midnight on Wednesday, Renzo Carlo Testa, 85, died from the coronavirus in a hospital in the northern Italian town of Bergamo. Five days later, his body was still sitting in a coffin, one of scores lined head-to-toe in the church of the local cemetery, which is itself closed to the public.

His wife of 50 years, Franca Stefanelli, would like to give him a proper funeral. But traditional funeral services are illegal throughout Italy now, part of the national restrictions against gatherings and going out that have been put in place to try to stem the spread of Europe’s worst outbreak of the coronavirus. In any case, she and her sons could not attend anyway, because they are themselves sick and in quarantine.

“It’s a strange thing,” Ms. Stefanelli, 70, said, struggling to explain what she was going through. “It’s not anger. It’s impotence in the face of this virus.”
The coronavirus epidemic raging through Italy has already left streets empty and shops shuttered as 60 million Italians are essentially under house arrest. There are the exhausted doctors and nurses toiling day and night to keep people alive. There are children hanging drawings of rainbows from their windows and families singing from their balconies.

But the ultimate metric of pandemics and plagues are the bodies they leave behind. In Italy, with the oldest population in Europe, the toll has been heavy, with more than 2,100 deaths, the most outside of China. On Monday alone, more than 300 people died.

And the bodies are piling up in the northern region of Lombardy, especially in the province of Bergamo. With 3,760 total cases reported on Monday, an increase of 344 cases from the day before, according to officials, it is at the center of the outbreak.

Hospital morgues there are inundated. Bergamo’s mayor, Giorgio Gori, issued an ordinance that closed the local cemetery this week for the first time since World War II, though he guaranteed that its mortuary would still accept coffins. Many of them had been sent to the Church of All Saints in Bergamo, located in the closed cemetery, where scores of waxed wooden coffins form a macabre line for cremations.

“Unfortunately, we don’t know where to put them,” said Brother Marco Bergamelli, one of the priests at the church. He said that with hundreds dying each day, and with each body taking more than an hour to cremate, there was an awful backlog. “It takes time and the dead are many.”
An emergency national law issued last week banned civil and religious ceremonies, including funerals, to prevent the spread of the virus. Officials have allowed priests to say a prayer at burials attended by just a few of the bereaved. In his brief prayers to family members, who often wore masks, Brother Marco said that he tried to give consolation and hope and urged people to be close, if permitted, to those who were alone. “This tragedy reminds us to love life,” he said.

In the nearby village of Zogno, the local priest has decided to ring the death knell just once a day, to keep from ringing it all day long. In another town, Casalpusterlengo, the Rev. Pierluigi Leva said believers were taking the “absence” of funerals especially hard.

Family members are spirited away and, because of the danger of contagion, often die in hospital isolation without any family or friends around. Local associations in the northern city of Brescia have started collecting donations of tablet devices to give to hospitals so that coronavirus patients can stay in touch — or say goodbye — to their families back home.

Mr. Testa’s death notice appeared on Friday in a local paper, L’Eco di Bergamo. The paper usually has a single page of death notices. On Friday there were 10 pages, and the rest was dedicated to the virus devastating Bergamo.

“For us, it’s a trauma, an emotional trauma,” said Alberto Ceresoli, who edits the paper. “These are people who die alone and who are buried alone. They didn’t have someone hold their hand and the funerals have to be tiny, with a quick prayer from the priest. Many of the close relatives are in quarantine.”

Giorgio Valoti, the mayor of nearby Cene, died last Friday. He was 70. His son, Alessandro, said that 90 people died the same day in Bergamo’s main hospital. The virus “is massacring this valley, every family is losing someone dear to them,” he said. “In Bergamo, so many bodies are piling up they don’t know what to do with them.”
In Fiobbio, a small village outside Bergamo, an ambulance came to collect Luca Carrara’s father, 86, on Saturday. On Sunday, another one came for his mother, 82. Mr. Carrara, 52, couldn’t visit them in hospital and stayed home in quarantine, where he has begun showing symptoms of the virus. On Tuesday, his parents died. Their bodies are held in the hospital morgue awaiting cremation.

“I am sorry that they are still there,” he said. “Still alone.”

Luca di Palma, 49, said his father, Vittorio, 79, died on Wednesday night, and that the funeral home he called told him that they had no space for the body. Instead, they delivered to his house a coffin, some candles, a cross and a mortuary refrigerator so that he could lay his father out in the living room. He said nobody came to pay respects, out of fear of contagion, though his father had died before he could be confirmed as a coronavirus case, and doctors had refused to perform a post-mortem swab test.

On Saturday, Mr. di Palma followed a hearse carrying his father’s body to a cemetery in Bergamo, where a caretaker let them in and locked the gates behind. A priest arrived to offer a brief prayer over the hearse, its trunk lifted. Mr. di Palma said his father wanted to be cremated, but the wait was long. “Painful,” he said.

In a country where many learn in school about the dreaded Monatti who, preceded by the ringing of a little bell, retrieved corpses on carts during the 17th-century Milan plague, the amassing of dead bodies seems out of another time.

Alessandro Bosi, secretary of the National Federation of Funeral Homes, said that the virus had also caught the mortuary industry by surprise, with those who handle the dead not having sufficient masks or gloves. While health authorities say they do not believe that the virus can be transmitted posthumously, Mr. Bosi said that a corpse’s lungs often released air when being moved.

“We have to consider them in the way we would treat infectious individuals, and take the same care,” he said."

In Italy if every person survived who was sick right now, they would have a 7.7% mortality rate. The whole world if everyone survived who was sick, 3.6%.

With the state of our medical system and the fact that we only have 330,000 beds for this right now I can't imagine even in the USA it will be that low.

Our infection rate goes up anywhere from 10% to 30% or so everyday.  if this continues at a rate of 20% gain in infected per day in 15 days we could have 50,000 infected increasing by 9000.

This model accurately depicts the rates of Italy. On the third they were at 1800 with 300 per day, increase by 20% infected each day, on the 15th we should have 19000, there were 20000.

25 days we will be above 330,000 across our nation. this overwhelms our medical system and then we are in the same boat as italy.

This is not guaranteed by any means however this is pretty accurate to where Italy is at.

However, Italy is routinely ranked 2nd by WHO in healthcare and the USA isn't even ranked top 25.

[here is a model at 20% increase in infected each day](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1czHc4Glo9r4oRA1o5L3G0zmDGveWi4lOAsnilSB5nCg/edit?usp=sharing) There is only a -3.5% error for Italy however the USA outpaces that by 33%.

[https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/country/us/](https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/country/us/) this is where my information is from.

Also worth noting, since you can be reinfected with the Corona virus and it can leave parts of your lungs paralyzed, the death toll could increase further."

>He has passed marriage equality, cut deals with Republicans, meddled incessantly in the running of the subway system.

Governments aren't implementing economy-destroying quarantines for shits and giggles.

I'm Canadian, and our government's response has generally been considered one of the best outside East Asia, but our Minister of Health still predicts that 30-70% of Canadians will be infected before the pandemic runs its course, with 30% being the best-case scenario if we do perfect social distancing. Even with a much lower death rate than was seen in China/Iran/etc., we'll be looking at tens or maybe hundreds of thousands dead in Canada alone. In America things will be *much* worse considering the terrible government response.

Rachel Louise Snyder, the author of “No Visible Bruises: What We Don’t Know About Domestic Violence Can Kill Us,” explores the hidden dangers of social distancing.(Douglas Sacha/Getty Images)

By RACHEL LOUISE SNYDER

MARCH 16, 20203:55 PM

I’ve been thinking a lot about a woman I met some years ago. She lives in San Diego; her boyfriend once held her hostage for three days. He first split open her lip, and then he seemed to be angry at her that she had a split lip and he took an Adidas shoe and beat her on the back. He strangled her when she was in the shower. He threw things at her and held a knifepoint to her eye.

&#x200B;

She was in decent shape and she wondered, during those three days, if she could get out of the house and outrun him. She wondered where she might run and who might help. Shame and fear held her in place.

&#x200B;

Less than five miles away from where she was being held, in the only training of its kind in the country, police officers learn to address hostage situations in the context of domestic violence. Thanks primarily to film and television, most of us imagine bank heists when we hear the word “hostage.” In fact, though reliable statistics are hard to come by, domestic violence episodes comprise somewhere near 80% of all hostage situations in the United States.

&#x200B;

This matters a great deal because those who take hostages in banks generally want to live, whereas men — and it’s nearly always men — who take their partners hostage do not share this incentive. Often, they care little whether anyone lives or dies, including themselves; what they want is to maintain control.

&#x200B;

The woman I met in San Diego was not poor. She was not uneducated. She was the primary breadwinner. She was beautiful, and young, and smart. After three days, she convinced her partner that they needed supplies. He drove with her to a convenience store. She sat in the passenger seat while he shopped. He’d taken her phone and her keys.

&#x200B;

She thought of running, but she was barefoot. How far would she get? Where would she go?

&#x200B;

When they pulled back up to their apartment, she saw her neighbors getting into their minivan. She did not think. She bolted, barefoot, and dived into the open door of the minivan.

&#x200B;

This is what I’ve been contemplating as communities across the country begin to recommend — and in the case of cities like Los Angeles, mandate — social distancing to slow the spread of coronavirus: What if her neighbors hadn’t been out there, getting in the car? What if she’d fled to a house that did not answer the door? What if she’d fled to the emergency room and found it so overwhelmed it could not address her needs? There was eventually a five-hour standoff between the police and her boyfriend, who had barricaded himself inside their apartment.

&#x200B;

People like her are the ones I’m thinking about during this pandemic — those for whom the world outside might be safer than their own home. What if her already-violent boyfriend could not attend his Ironman trainings? Or watch sports to decompress? What if there were no reason for her coworkers to wonder why she wasn’t at work? What happens when the demands of social distancing mean the most vulnerable in our society might be distanced right out of existence?

&#x200B;

Where can they go in the age of coronavirus?

&#x200B;

Who keeps them safe in a world of unmitigated dangers?

&#x200B;

In times of natural disasters and great social upheaval — Hurricanes Katrina and Sandy, for example — the systems we’ve created to aid domestic violence victims can get easily overwhelmed. Nurses qualified to do forensic exams are already being pulled into more general care or into emergency rooms. At the same time, those nurses tend to be women. They are more likely than men to be caring for aging parents. They are more likely to shoulder childcare burdens. And in this moment, many of them — like me — have children who are now home from school.

&#x200B;

In communities across Southern California and throughout the country, coronavirus fears have driven an increase in gun and tactical body armor sales. And the research is unequivocal; guns in the home of an abuser increase the chances of homicide by at least five times.

&#x200B;

All of this is happening in a country where domestic violence homicides have steadily risen since 2010 and, in fact, have spiked since 2017.

&#x200B;

National and community crises historically have led to increased reports of domestic abuse. During the Deepwater Horizon oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico, the National Domestic Violence Hotline saw a 13% increase in calls from the Gulf area from April to June 2010. New Orleans and Lafayette, two of the largest communities affected by the spill, saw increases to their hotlines of 81% and 116%, respectively, during that same period. Hurricane Katrina too saw domestic assaults against women nearly double, and both men and women reported increases of psychological abuse.

&#x200B;

This all sounds grim, but many of these situations involve couples who were not in healthy relationships to begin with. On a call from her Baltimore home, Jacquelyn Campbell, a professor from the Johns Hopkins School of Nursing and the country’s foremost researcher in domestic violence, was careful to point out that someone who is not psychologically or physically abusive before a crisis like coronavirus is not going to suddenly become violent. “This is not like anything I’ve lived through,” she said, “and my hypothesis is that any kind of horrific anything externally can exacerbate domestic violence.”

&#x200B;

Campbell created a danger assessment decades ago that many programs now use to try to predict a domestic homicide before it happens. The stressors identified that make a situation lethal are the same whether we are in a pandemic or not: guns in the home, forced sex, unemployment and, most notably, prior incidents of domestic violence.

&#x200B;

But the research on how domestic violence might be affected by our current situation simply does not exist. When an entire society shuts down, when children are home all day from school, when sports and gyms and social activities are all canceled, when friends can’t leave their own families to help, when places of worship are shuttered, when everything that ever tempered a violent situation is suddenly, terrifyingly, no longer available. What happens then?

&#x200B;

Campbell says measures like the House of Representatives’ legislation to offer financial relief might go a long way in quelling the danger and maintaining healthy families. She also says domestic violence victims often tend to have compromised immune systems given the stress they face daily and as such should be eligible for coronavirus testing sooner than the general population. Shelters should have testing kits early for the same reason.

We can try to prepare, and we can try to predict. But we are in foreign territory here, a countrywide state of emergency, a pandemic moving with more speed and temerity and adaptability that we have seen in a century — since, in fact, a time before we had data and research and systems to address domestic violence. Since a time when it was still perfectly legal to beat or rape one’s wife.

&#x200B;

So I think of that woman in San Diego. Her boyfriend was eventually sentenced to life in prison. At her trial, an emergency room doctor testified that he’d never seen bruising like hers, her skin stretched so thin to cover the swelling it was near bursting. Layers of new bruises atop old. “You don’t know what it’s like to run,” she told me years later, after she was truly, finally safe, “until you’re running for your life.”

>CHICAGO (CBS) — As the United States desperately scrambles to find enough tests for COVID-19, a hospital in Evanston has developed one that can provide results in just a few hours.
The test, created in the Molecular Lab at North Shore University Health System, Evanston Hospital, was first used last Thursday. The lab has conducted 400 tests to day, with 10 percent testing positive for COVID 19.  The hospital aims to be able to test 1,000 by next week. It has been used mostly for their hospital patients, but it has been made available for some patients at other hospitals as well.

>“We started in January watching this knowing that we would not have enough tests,” said Dr. Karen Kaul.

>Many patients, even if they can get a test, have to wait days for results.  The Evanston Hospital test is much faster with results in four to six hours. Researchers take a swab specimen from deep inside the patient’s nose and are able to determine whether it contains DNA from COVID-19, the respiratory disease caused by the novel coronavirus.

>Evanston  is one of only a handful of hospitals in the United States that has developed a diagnostic test for COVID 19. Researchers there also developed a test for H1N1 during that outbreak 12 years ago.

>“On the front lines are the hospitals that need to make decision that day about whether a patient get isolated of sent home,” Kaul said. “I think we are still underprepared.I think we will see massive volumes of patients needing testing in the coming weeks.”

>There are 105 cases of COVID 19 in Illinois so far, but that number is expected to go much higher as more testing becomes available. The disease causes flu-like symptoms, but is more virulent in certain patients, especially the elderly. In others, the symptoms are mild. All the patients in the reported cases in Illinois are recovering."

The ones that they said 'wouldn't work'.

Having seen an explosion in critical care admissions over the weekend, we are all afraid that the ship has well and truly sailed.

At the start of the month the UK admitted its first critically ill patient. A little over a week ago, there were around 20 confirmed critically ill patients nationally.

This morning, in our local hospital network (across **7 hospitals**), there are **58** confirmed or highly suspected (awaiting test result) critically ill patients. These are patients who picked up the infection 10-14 days ago and exhibited 5-7 days of illness before developing severe pneumonia requiring ventilation.

This is a Public Health England letter to hospitals about a new COVID-19 reporting strategy. It suggests that they were only collecting data about critically ill patients on a weekly basis: [https://www.england.nhs.uk/coronavirus/wp-content/uploads/sites/52/2020/03/phe-letter-to-trusts-re-daily-covid-19-hospital-surveillance-11-march-2020.pdf](https://www.england.nhs.uk/coronavirus/wp-content/uploads/sites/52/2020/03/phe-letter-to-trusts-re-daily-covid-19-hospital-surveillance-11-march-2020.pdf). Daily critical care admissions is a much better indicator of disease progression in a population than ""number of new cases"", as it is not dependant on testing methodology or numbers of tested. If PHE were only collecting this data on a weekly basis beforehand, they will have missed some shocking numbers."

I am proud that so much of our country is actually taking coronavirus seriously, though it comes at a great sacrifice through the travel and service industries.

It is a horrible idea to maintain open public facilities right now. Even though the chance of transmission is low... it is not a risk worth taking. Businesses want one last gasp of money from an otherwise profitable week, at the expense of public health risk. Yes, people are stupid for going to these and it is not fully the business' fault... but is completely avoidable. Pretty sure no one is going to mind having COVID after-parties once this thing is cleared up. Everyone is going to be yearning to eat out and grab drinks like it's 1999 once a vaccine is finalized or the spread has been contained.

I live in PA and we are entering a state of emergency as of right now, following Delaware's state of emergency. All non-essential businesses are closing for 14 days starting tomorrow, if they have not already. If Maine does not pass similar execution, it is an embarrassment to the state. Especially considering Maine has a statistically greater/significant population of older citizens. Right now coronavirus is increasing exponentially in northern Delaware (due to an infection at the University of Delaware for a professor and grad students) and of course the Philly area. 

Yes, people are panicking and being stupid. That does not excuse taking the necessary precautions to stave off the coronavirus from spreading even more than it has. You may survive it as nothing more than a flu-like cold, but in the time you are transmitting you could be killing someone's grandparents just trying to buy something from the grocery store or pumping gas. I urge everyone to stay at work, home, and minimize exposure for the sake of the elderly. If you are feeling truly bad about the servers, look up the related gofundme pages and protest owners to actually pay their employees. A lot of these businesses now have access to virtually 0% loans they could easily use to curb the losses, but they are refusing out of greed and stubbornness... at the expense of their employees who can do nothing about the situation. 

Sorry for the rant... but as someone in a portion of the country currently getting closer and closer to strict quarantine rules... it's time to stop fucking around. We as a country can chill for two weeks and stop this thing from unnecessarily taking more lives."

We all need to take responsibility for our own decisions and lives now. 

Children are key vectors of coronavirus, often transmitting it without showing symptoms. There is an up to 14 day incubation period.

Ideally you should do both - remove the children from school, and isolate/increase hygiene and distancing within the home for at least the next 14 days. Schools will likely be closed soon anyway; it's not worth the risk. 

However, if the children are removed from school, don't replace this with other social contact - they can still bring the virus back into the home from playground contact, etc. so ideally socially distance/isolate them too/be extremely vigilant.

These are tough decisions and only you know what's right for your family. The right answers are going to be the hardest, but the best for the long-term. We can only do what we think is best, at the time, to the best of our efforts, and we won't always get it right."

*Economic*

Local dollar stores around me have run out of supplies and closed down until further notice. Grocery stores are out, gas stations are out, hardware stores are out, anyone who sells toilet paper is out. Governor Sisolak announced yesterday that Nevada's entire K-through Grade 12 public school system is shut down for three weeks. Libraries, ski resorts, casinos, hotels, sports events, shopping malls and other places are closing down too. If you're not already sheltered in place, you're kinda screwed, and some people do wonder how the local homeless population is going to fare. 

I haven't even bothered with checking the local hospitals and clinics. Pretty much assuming they're triaging based on need and lacking for supplies like everyone else. 

On the plus side, on Sunday a federal judge also blocked Trump from removing food stamps, and she cited Coronavirus as a compelling public interest to do so, so nobody has to worry about paying for food in a month. 

*Social* 

Stores have been rummaged through, but everyone's surprisingly polite to each other. Presumably because we're all armed. I've seen more than a few just open carry as they push carts through Wal-Mart, and we all give each other lots of space for multiple reasons. 


*Environmental* 

We're getting our first serious snow blizzard in months. It's making its way up Truckee and hitting our area tonight. 

Trees are happy for the moisture (although they're ALL budding out, not good) birds and rabbits are foraging before the snow hits, and there's not a lot of traffic around. It feels peaceful. Good time to bake bread, keep the woodstove fed and browse Reddit on my couch, like I'm doing. :)"

But once they get more tests rolled out they'll likely loosen up the requirements on non-critical cases. 

At this point it looks like they are reserving tests for critically ill to know what, if any, additional treatment a person might need. The antivirals for flu don't work on coronavirus and the ones that seem to work on coronavirus aren't effecting for flu, for instance.

Let’s just jump straight into this good news stuff today, shall we? I’ve got a lot of awesome stuff to cover so no prelude rambling from me this time. 

-First off, in addition to drugs such as remdesivir (currently in trials), [another potential treatment for the virus has been found!](https://ipfs.infura.io/ipfs/QmNcF4usFUJdGjTMtEXT1XAYybJvtLmEjaZnvNXN2n91Zh/) This drug has been in use since 1945 to treat malaria, and shows promise as a suitable antiviral to fight COVID-19. The authors of the study state that it can result in “faster time to recovery and shorter hospital stay(s)”. The more treatments we have in testing, the better!

-[Here is an article](https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-outbreak-diamond-princess-cruise-ship-death-rate) which (despite its somewhat evocative headline) goes into detail on explaining the potential death rate of the virus using the Diamond Princess cruise ship as a study. Essentially, those were perfect conditions for the virus to wreak the most havoc. The ship was mostly full of older people, they were in close proximity to each other, all breathing the same air... if a virus was going to spread anywhere, it’d be there. AND YET... the death rate is 0.5 percent on that ship. This article postulates that this may help us more accurately pin down what we may expect the death rate to actually be. In other words, according to these folks, we can expect the death rate to maybe plane closer to 0.5 percent... obviously significantly lower than the current 3.4 percent. 

-[More good news from the Diamond Princess!](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www3.nhk.or.jp/nhkworld/en/news/20200316_10/amp.html) According to this article, the last group of patients on board the ship have recovered and are now able to go home- I believe this is just those still in Tokyo, but still, awesome news! 

-[Here’s an article](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/fji8x6/200305003_high_temperature_and_high_humidity/?utm_source=share&amp;amp;amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;amp;amp;utm_name=iossmf) from Cornell which indicates that our hopes may not be invalid- the virus seems to struggle to spread under high heat and humidity! In other words- when summer rolls around in the northern hemisphere, the rate of infection is expected to slow. Slower rate of infection means less burden on hospitals means a higher survival rate! Oh, and just in case that wasn’t enough? [Here’s a different study with similar findings, bam!](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.12.20034728v1)

-Let’s go just a bit deeper on the expected case fatality rate. I’m going to provide three links. As a nerd, I [really loved this one, first.](https://coronawiki.org/page/new-coronavirus-why-its-so-deadly-in-italy) This article goes into depth on Italy vs. South Korea, and the reason why S.K. is showing such a low case fatality rate (currently 0.98%) while Italy’s is so much higher. I’ll pull out the two most crucial parts: first, Italy has a significantly higher average age when compared to South Korea (and even most other countries in general). This raises a question: is Italy the outlier, or is S.K.? The answer the article came to is that S.K. is likely to be more indicative of the global case fatality rate, and therefore, this places the final, actual CFR around one percent. Not 3.4 percent. Not 8 percent. One percent. 

Further evidence on that last point, [here is an article on why the case fatality rate will probably turn out to be lower.](https://slate.com/technology/2020/03/coronavirus-mortality-rate-lower-than-we-think.html) Don’t worry, if you clicked that link and saw the update at the top of the page, I’m going to talk about it in a bit. 

Oh... [one more study](https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-17453/v1) that puts us around that 1 percent mark- this one actually estimates the CFR to be lower than currently reported for all groups, including the elderly!

-[Here is a fantastic study](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fped.2020.00104/full) which indicates that pregnant mothers, infected with the virus, can not transmit the illness to the baby while she’s pregnant!

I love the science but that’s not all you need, I’m sure. Let’s rapid-fire through just a small handful of other great things I saw today.

-[Mitt Romney may be a conservative](https://thehill.com/homenews/senate/487794-romney-proposes-sending-1000-to-every-american-adult-amid-coronavirus?fbclid=IwAR2aZJA5E5PdjtQZxGeJCO6und-klNzilV-9Jae78x_zdjnhT-mk0aY9XOk), but even he knows the necessity to keep Americans paid during this time. He proposed that all Americans get $1000 this month to help us get through it, and if he’s saying it, well... he’s going to have a lot of support getting that to go through, on both sides of the aisle. 

-[The owner of Taco Bell, KFC, and Pizza Hut](https://www.restaurantbusinessonline.com/financing/taco-bells-owner-will-pay-workers-during-coronavirus-closures) plans on paying workers through the closings of the restaurants! According to the article, both McDonald’s and Starbucks have similar plans as well. 

-[Tom Hanks and Rita Wilson have been released from the hospital! They’ve fully recovered!](https://www.google.com/amp/s/amp.cnn.com/cnn/2020/03/16/entertainment/tom-hanks-rita-wilson-released-hospital-coronavirus/index.html) Like many people smarter than myself have said, now including this couple, “take it one day at a time”. Additionally, they reported that their symptoms were pretty mild. 

-[For my U.K. friends](https://www.google.com/amp/s/amp.cnn.com/cnn/2020/03/16/europe/boris-johnson-uk-coronavirus-response-ramped-up/index.html), Boris Johnson announced today that they are changing their strategy from the old one to one which more closely resembles what the rest of the world is doing. Expect to see more good news, policies, and plans to start rolling out this week. 

-The trend continues to rise! [Worldometer once again reports](https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/) another uptick in the mild cases- we are now up to 94% mild!! Even for all my optimism, I’m shocked to see this trend continue in such a positive way. 

Ugh, guys... I need you to believe me on this but I have seen just so much freakin great news today on this whole thing. I promise I have more to share but as you can tell... this thing is long enough as it is. I had a whole lot planned to write on the underlying conditions and high-risk populations, testing too, and most importantly I felt I really need to talk about staying home and social isolation... but this is probably pushing the character limit as it is already. I think tomorrow morning I’m just literally going to bullet point the good news to the best of my ability rather than explaining every one in detail- but don’t worry, I’m still going to do that too for my main posts like this. 

When you’re done with this post, I want you to soak up every bit of optimism I’ve tried to give you. I want you to use that optimism as a boost of momentum to get your day going and keep on moving forward with whatever needs to be done. Keep your heads high everyone. Stay the fuck home. Wash your hands. Love you all so much and I will see you tomorrow.

If you need more good news, here’s my [first](http://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/eupik4/coronavirus_megathread/fkezb7w), [second](http://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/eupik4/coronavirus_megathread/fkgkszf), [third](http://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/eupik4/coronavirus_megathread/fki38kr), and [fourth](http://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/eupik4/coronavirus_megathread/fklp28i) posts.

Yes, I know that's ""some guy on Reddit"" but his citations and math check out to me. Point out flaws if you can find them, please. I would love to know he's wrong.

Edit: [here's a CDC estimate of up to 70,000 in Arizona alone](https://www.abc15.com/news/region-phoenix-metro/central-phoenix/as-many-as-70-000-az-residents-could-have-coronavirus-according-to-cdc-models) and Arizona is merely a medium state with one big fuckoff city, one small city, and a whole lot of fucking nothing otherwise. But that's 7% of the way to 1 million in one state, and a state that was late to the party at that.

It has a 5 day period from infection to 50% showing symptoms, with the vast majority symptomatic by 12. Fatal cases generally are hospitalised 11 days after onset, which means there's a big lag between infection and hospitalisation.

It's growing geometrically and is undetected in the vast majority, especially the 20-29 group who experience milder symptoms.

I would love it if this is shown to be wrong. Because that would mean canceling game nights *now* will actually be more effective at slowing the spread. But at the rate this virus grows, it won't be wrong for more than another week or two. And we still need to cancel game nights. If we do it now will reduce the length of time we ultimately have to cancel them for."

but the rest... whew. saying coronavirus is an influenza is patently false.

[COVID-19 is much more deadly than seasonal influenza](https://www.sciencealert.com/the-new-coronavirus-isn-t-like-the-flu-but-they-have-one-big-thing-in-common).

Yes, influenza can originate in animals and [so can coronavirus](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK92442/). That doesn't make them the same thing though. 

There is no scientific consensus about women getting over the flu sooner. In fact, [men may get over it sooner](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2018/07/180717102810.htm). [Coronavirus may be killing more men](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/20/health/coronavirus-men-women.html), and that may be due to other factors like rates of smoking, but it [may have a larger impact on women](https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2020/03/the-coronavirus-fallout-may-be-worse-for-women-than-men-heres-why/).

insert photo of him with mask
In 2014, with the song Rotten Souls on the second KYS EP, Ruby says ""Yeah I'll go to your show because attendance is low"". After he says this, he proceeds to cough. As you may know, coronavirus spreads from person to person when people cough without covering their mouth. Now, we may not know if Ruby covered his mouth in this instance, but let's say for arguments sake he didn't. In Australia, the government have now cancelled all events that have more than 500 people in attendance. As attendance is low in the show Ruby says he will go to, we can assume that the venue is quite small. So, even though there might be less than 500 people in the venue, the people that are in attendance would be in close proximity with each other. It's safe to say that the spread of coronavirus would be quite high. 


However, these aren't the only hints Ruby has dropped. In the song ""Failure By Design"", Ruby firstly says ""lungs black from all the coughing"". Coronavirus' main symptom is, you guessed it, coughing as it is a respiratory disease. He then follows that with ""I'm so sick"". In the song ""Champion of Death"", Ruby says ""Yung Plague with the masked face"". Coronavirus has a lot of people wearing face masks so this could be interpreted as a reference to this, not to mention one of his alter egos is Yung Plague. Can you see where I'm going with this?


Ruby is not the only one to hint at the fact he may be patient zero for coronavirus. In the song ""2nd Hand"", $crim opens up with the lyric ""All I see is scrubs"". People who have been in close contact with those who have coronavirus are strongly advised to get tested themselves. As $crim and Ruby are quite close, it's reasonable to assume that $crim could have contracted coronavirus from Ruby. The scrubs lyric could be a reference to being tested in hospital and seeing multiple nurses and doctors wearing scrubs. In 2nd hand, Ruby also says ""bring out your dead and blame it on Yung Plague"". Could this be a reference to the fact Ruby feels guilt over being patient zero and causing the deaths of those who have passed away from coronavirus?""


With all of this evidence stacked against Ruby, I implore you to make your own assumptions, but I think the facts strongly suggest that Ruby da Cherry, ""Yung Plague"", is the first recorded case of Coronavirus."

Many are not especially informed or insightful, and can’t quite be trusted to not share misinformation or tone-deaf sentiments.  

Their audience is there for fashion/decor/recipes/whatever and should get their info about global crises elsewhere.  Best case scenario, some followers will be turned off by more coronavirus hand-wringing when they were browsing Instagram precisely as a distraction from all that.  Worst case scenario, a few fools will believe that coating their hands with essential oils is better than washing them just because A Peck of Paris said so.

*That being said*, it’s doubly irresponsible for these folks to share their vacation/bar-hopping/kid’s birthday party with a mile-long guest list.  Bad enough to do those things in the first place, but to promote such behavior may be even worse.

As with all things, there must be a happy medium.  Like, “hey guys, I know we’re all washing our hands a lot more often than before, so let me tell you about my favorite hand crème that keeps them baby-soft!”  If they have a role to play at all in this sort of thing, I believe it’s to simply be a good example — not a source of information."

The other 15, I chased around the hospital for a month, trying to get them to commit to coming to my station and doing the test. I was such a Pickmeisha! Ladies, I had no idea of my own worth.

But now, airborne illness is A Thing, and people are flocking to me. It's like I've discovered the Power of the Pussy. Or Why Men Love Bitches. I am the fit-testing Queen. Everyone wants me.

No Evidence Ibuprofen Bad for COVID-19 Patients: Nurofen-Maker

By Reuters
March 16, 2020, 10:33 a.m. ET

(Reuters) - Nurofen producer Reckitt Benckiser sought to quash warnings against taking the drug on Monday, saying it was not aware of any evidence that the pills' active ingredient ibuprofen adversely impacted patients suffering from COVID-19.

The company's statement followed a warning by France's health minister on Saturday that people should not use anti-inflammatory drugs such as ibuprofen if they have coronavirus-like symptoms.

Olivier Véran, France's health minister who is also a qualified doctor, said in a tweet on Saturday: ""The taking of anti-inflammatories [ibuprofen, cortisone … ] could be a factor in aggravating the infection. In case of fever, take paracetamol. If you are already taking anti-inflammatory drugs, ask your doctor's advice.""

Nurofen, one of Reckitt's more popular drugs, contains 200 mg of Ibuprofen as its active ingredient in each tablet and is indicated for ""effective pain and inflammation relief and reducing fever,"" according to the company's website. ""RB has neither received new safety information nor been involved in the evaluation of any adverse events regarding the use of ibuprofen in COVID-19,"" the company said on Monday.

""Appropriate use of ibuprofen and paracetamol is still currently being recommended by most European health authorities as part of the symptomatic treatment of COVID-19.""

The number of deaths in France from the coronavirus increased by more than a third on Sunday to 127 and over 5,400 have been infected, according to the country's health authorities. (https://reut.rs/2TVwxKR)

The cover-up is **not** that the offer was never made. Of course it was. It is the precise opposite, that the offer was made to *many* companies not just the one. That act of deception might work, especially to the ideologically blind in the Trump Cult USA. It undoubtedly has a small element of truth to it as opposed to the ridiculous lie that the offer was never made. 

You should really pay attention to what Trump's accomplices are saying. It's an intelligent dodge while making up news stories to deny the obvious is not.

Mike DeWine and Secretary of State Frank LaRose to postpone Election Day until June 2 in reaction to the worsening of the coronavirus crisis.

So for now the election remains a go, though confusion on the matter is permeating statewide, including in Lucas County, where officials at a Board of Elections Monday night seemed to be operating under the belief that the election will, in fact, not take place until June.

But during a hearing in Columbus, Common Pleas Court Judge Richard Frye said there were too many variables to weigh to warrant putting off Election Day. He specifically took note that Mr. DeWine did not call the General Assembly back into emergency session to deal with the issue.

Mr. DeWine and Mr. LaRose, the state’s top elections official, announced Monday that they no longer felt it safe for Ohioans, particularly the elderly, to vote in person on Election Day. The problem was he couldn’t postpone an election himself.

Instead, Mr. LaRose said he would not contest a lawsuit that was quickly filed to ask the judge to do what the governor wanted.

“This should extend the period of time so people will not have to choose between their constitutional rights and their health,” Mr. DeWine said. “This was not a decision that was easily made..., but it is, I believe, the right thing to do.”

But the judge said no.

“I'm also anxious about the fact that there are some unknown number, presumed thousands of ballots in the possession of 88 county boards of election...,” Judge Frye said, noting there could be questions about the security of those ballots over the next two and a half months.

Lucas County Board of Election Director LeVera Scott, in comments to The Blade Monday afternoon, underscored the largely unprecedented nature of Mr. DeWine’s latest move. She said the governor’s office does not have the legal power to unilaterally reschedule or delay the election. His directive amounts to more of a recommendation, Ms. Scott said.

“It doesn’t mean anything to our operations until it’s an order from the legislature,” she said.

On Monday evening the Lucas County Board of Elections’ website was updated with a message written in bold red letters:

The March 17, 2020 Primary Election has been postponed,” the message states. “Further information will be released soon.”

The General Assembly, meanwhile, is currently on election recess, a recess that has been extended because of the coronavirus situation. So the governor is counting on a judge to make the election postponement official.

So far, none of the three other states scheduled to hold primaries tomorrow — Florida, Illinois, and Arizona — have postponed.

The lawsuit sought a temporary restraining order against moving forward with the election was filed by Franklin County residents Judy Brockman and Jill Reardon. Both individuals are older than 65 and are therefore considered at a higher risk to coronavirus threats.

“...plaintiffs fear that if they travel to their assigned polling location on Election Day and vote in the March 17, 2020 Presidential Primary Election they may contract, and then spread and the COVID-19 virus,” the suit reads.

In-person early voting ended at 2 p.m. on Monday.

The leaders of the Ohio Democratic and Republican parties had signed off on the plan.

“Over my years as an election official, I have come to understand the need to be flexible,” said Lisa Welch, first vice president of the Ohio Association of Election Officials. “This takes it to a whole new level.”

Lucas County Democratic Party Chairman Kurt Young said the governor’s recommendation is a balance between protecting Ohioans’ safety and ensuring elections are run effectively. Poll workers across the state have opted to stay home to avoid catching or spreading coronavirus. If delaying Election Day to ensure more people don’t get sick, that’s the right move, he said.

“The first thing we want to worry about is safety, and the second thing is that we have a proper good election here. We’re hearing things from other counties of being hundreds of poll workers short,” Mr. Young said.

Lucas County Republican Party Chairman Mark Wagoner could not immediately be reached for comment on Monday.

Mayor Wade Kapszukiewicz was expecting election results Tuesday on his proposed income tax increase that could bolster the city’s funding stream for the next decade. On the ballot as Issue 1 is a proposal to raise Toledo’s temporary income tax from 0.75 percent to 1.25 percent to pay for things like residential streets repairs, parks improvements, preschool education, and emergency services.

He said the governor made his recommendation to postpone the election with public health and public safety in mind.

“We’ll have plenty of time leading up to June 2 to talk about the need to fix our roads, but right now the focus needs to be on public health, and that’s what we’re going to do,” he said.

Mr. Kapszukiewicz said he wished state officials had given the 88 county elections boards a little more of a heads up before they made their decision — the governor informed Ohio’s big city mayors about noon — but he noted the country is going through an unusual time.

“I know the governor is taking actions that he believes are important to protect public health. I applaud him for that and I think some of these decisions that he’s making are unprecedented and they’re difficult,” he said.

The League of Women Voters of Ohio said the governor made the right recommendation.

“Phones have been ringing off the hook from concerned voters, poll workers, and boards of election about how not ready we were to have an election during a pandemic,” Executive Director Jen Smith said. “We were very worried that people were choosing between health and safety and participating in democracy.

“We support the secretary of state and Governor DeWine in this decision, but the state of Ohio should recognize that a lot of policy changes could be put in place to better deal with unexpected challenges.”

Dr. Amy Acton, state health director, signed an order Monday adding gyms, recreation centers, bowling alleys, movie theaters, among others businesses to a list of forced closures that already includes schools, dine-in restaurants, and bars.

The governor has taken strong action to prevent crowds of people from gathering, announcing a new order or regulation almost daily. Mass gatherings of more than 50 people are now prohibited, down from the governor's prior order of 100.

That could be further complication by President Trump's call to limit such gatherings to no more than 10, something that is also likely to mean some reporters will not be able to be present in the same room with the governor when he delivers his daily press briefings.

On Sunday the state announced it was closing bars and restaurants to dine-in customers for an undetermined amount of time as concerns about coronavirus and its potential to spread throughout masses of people has heightened. Twelve other have states have since enacted similar legislation allowing only carryout and drive-thru food orders.

K-12 schools have also been closed for three weeks, and there’s speculation that all in-person instruction for the remainder of the 2019-2020 school year will also be canceled.

The state currently has 50 cases of the virus across 12 counties, with 333 more people being under health supervision. Fourteen individuals have been hospitalized. Officials in Lucas County announced the first local case, a man in his 70s who returned from a trip to Europe at the end of February, on Sunday. That case remains the lone confirmed case in the county."

Another thing I totally don’t get is how they are saying herd immunity is the best action even though there are lots of cases that show that you can get the virus after losing it and being deemed fit again.

Why can’t they just take an example of the way japan and china acted, it may seem very extreme yet it has shown to reduce the curve...  It makes me wonder if its just about the economy and nothing else as they even claimed until the past weekend that it’s only harmful for the old and sick even though half of our IC is filled with people that are younger and in some cases “healthy”? I mean i get that you can make mistakes as experts but how hard is it to stick with facts as it now seems they discard what they know and pretend that they don’t know better so the public doesn’t panic and our economy can be restarted asap.."

I had been dreaming about getting a Subaru WRX since the first time I encountered it in video games (probably Forza Motorsport or Initial D Arcade) and ever since then I was waiting to be stable enough financially to afford one. I had been working at my job for 3 years, friends with the boss, the whole 9 yards and after an accident left my 1996 BMW 328i mangled and unrepairable, I decided to take the insurance money and put a down payment on my dream car. I knew it was going to be rough as even with a 7 year loan I was going to be stretched thin but I would find a way to make it work. So with 13 miles on the odometer I left the dealership in my brand new 2018 Subaru WRX. Learning the shifting was a bit troublesome as I hadn't daily driven a stick shift in almost 6 years. In the past 2 years it has been the battle of every time that car payment came out of my account, I cried a little but then I hit 20 lbds of boost and it put a smile right back on my face and it reminded me of why I chose to get this amazing piece of automotive engineering.

Today I was brought into the bosses office (the first of many) to be told that I would be furloughed for up to 2 months if not longer due to the coronavirus causing such massive travel restrictions and nobody able to visit the Grand Canyon. I was given a piece of paper saying my health insurance would be paid for the next 60 days or until I found another job and to apply for unemployment immediately. Of all the expenses I have, this one is going to be the one that has to be sacrificed in order to keep food on the table and a roof over my head. If it were just me, it would be one thing but it's my daughter and wife that I have to think about as well. The hardest part is knowing that this probably won't be the car that I hand down to my daughter when she is old enough to drive like I had intended.

I feel kinda selfish knowing others out there are going to have to sacrifice a lot more than I will but it still hurts knowing that I will probably have to let her go soon and there is nothing I can do. I hope she finds a good home as many memories with her will remain with me for the rest of my life."

A couple of years ago my husband and i were in this boat, with a sudden job loss out of the blue. I have a bit of advice as a result.

You already know to apply for unemployment. Also, keep finding out about coronavirus epidemic relief -- there's lots of stuff being discussed, like mortgage and eviction freezes. 

Figure out whether you qualify for food stamps. 

Immediately cut off unnecessary funding. Get rid of stuff like netflix, premium  cable, etc.. You need to have internet access for job hunting, etc., but you don't need Disney, Hulu plus, etc., etc... Cut off all unnecessary spending. 

Grocery bills are a place where people can save a lot. I made a lot of rice and bean meals, and you know what? No one complained, because rice and beans can be awesome as well as super cheap. Buy stuff like dried green peas and make split pea soup; I made that one a lot, and it was really good. When I say ""beans"", I mean dried ones you soak and then cook, as those are stupid cheap. Make fried rice with whatever is insanely cheap near you. 

Look into food pantries near you. 

Look around your house for things to sell. 

But most of all, stay calm. If you and your wife stay calm and stick together, you can get through this. My husband and I did. 

There are things which will be hiring through this. Delivery workers in particular come to mind; everyone is getting stuff delivered. If you have a decent car and a good driving record, maybe that would be short-term work for you."

“Washoe County says it didn't instigate Reno announcement to close non-essential businesses
Shortly after Mayor Hillary Schieve's announcement that she would force all non-essential businesses to close, the Washoe County Health District sent an email to all of its employees saying it did not instigate the effort.

""Contrary to recent reports from the City of Reno, WCHD has NOT issued any mandate that all restaurants, bars, casinos, or gyms in Washoe County close due to COVID-19,"" the email said. ""If you receive calls from the public, please advise them of this and let them know they can contact the City of Reno with any questions.

""We apologize for the inconvenience.""

Spokesman Scott Oxarart said the email was sent to all employees because the county was getting ""bombarded with phone calls from the public."""
