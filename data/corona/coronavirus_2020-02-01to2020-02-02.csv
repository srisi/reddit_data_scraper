So one possible explanation is that this virus mutated from a bat coronavirus and spread to the market, where it jumped to humans and began to spread via human-to-human transmission.

I've probably done more research than you on the topic, I've lost count of how many scientific papers I've read about vaccine safety.

>Perhaps start with vaers and the fact that they‚Äôve already paid out over 4 billion to people injured by vaccines.

Right.  Let's do some math with that, shall we?  VAERS has existed for 32 years, and that $4.2 billion figure covers all 32 of those years.  I can't find exact figures extending to 1988, but in the last 10 years 3.1 billion vaccine doses have been given in the US and that can be extrapolated to get about 10 billion vaccine doses given in the US since VAERS has existed.  That comes out to 42 cents of compensation per vaccine on average.  Compensations are usually on the order of hundreds of thousands of dollars, so I'll let you do the math on that one.

There are extensive tables on the odds of any given vaccine resulting in a VAERS claim.  For most vaccines that number is on the order in 1 in 2,000,000, the worst one by far being the Tetanus vaccine with a 1 in 100,000 chance of any given dose resulting in a claim.  3.8 million Tetanus vaccines given, and 52 VAERS claims.  That is the worst numbers for any vaccine, and this is your best evidence that vaccines are unsafe.

Let's compare this to something else to put this into perspective. There is about a 1 in 500,000 chance that you will die from choking on food in a given year.  1 in a million is about your odds of dying in a car crash every time you drive 60 miles.  1 in 3.6 million are your odds of being murdered tomorrow.  ""unsafe"" is a relative term, and if you base it on lottery jackpot odds than... well, I hope you enjoy your life of locking yourself in your basement wrapped in styrofoam.

Now, let's compare that to the odds of dying if you are not vaccinated.  The common flu kills about 1 in every 7,000 people.  The Coronavirus kills 1 in every 50 people woh contracts it.  Measles kills 1 in 500.  Tetanus kills 1 in 20.  Vaccines don't have to be perfect, they just have to be better than these odds.  And they are by at least 4 orders of magnitude."

>Dr. Konermann of Stanford just checked their results. The similarity is spurious. Out of 4 inserts they identify between NCov and SARS, 2 are found in bat coronavirus. Of the remaining two, only one is most similar to HIV, and is so short (6 AA) that the similarity is not higher than chance given database.  
...  
In fact, the Bat-SARS Like CoV, discovered in 2013, contains all the four insertions. Insertion 2 and 3 of 2019-nCoV are identical to Bat-SARS Like CoV. Insertion 1 involves two synonymous and one Thr-Ile mutation. Insertion 4 contains one synonymous mutation and a 12-bp insertion. Therefore, the two viruses have very high sequence similarity, and are likely evolutionarily related, naturally. Indeed, the four identified insertions are the result of the pair-wise comparison of Wuhan 2019-nCoV and 2013 SARS virus (Fig 1), and are an artifact when comparing only two viruses.  
...  
the alignment of the spike protein of the novel Coronavirus (protein ID QHD43416) with the bat spike protein mentioned by Jason Weir shows very high conservation (see attached image), particularly also in regards to the claimed ""inserts"" in Figure 2 of the preprint. This makes the bat Coronavirus a much more likely origin than the proposed connection to HIV.  
...  
I performed an alignment of these sequences and indeed found that these 4 insertions mentioned in the preprint are real. However I blasted each of these insertions to the non-redundant protein database and found over 100 hits for every single of these 4 insertions. The hits are others coronaviruses, plants, parasites, bacteria. This indicates the hits to HIV seems fortuitous and the evolutionary link between 2019-nCoV and HIV is to me not ascertained. Additionally, the authors in the manuscripts did not provide a e.value for their findings, nor they have explained in their methodology why they restricted their search for viral genomes only and not others organisms. Therefore I would argue that the results presented do not appear ""uncanny"" to me based on a flawed methodology. Therefore the results presented in this paper should be taken very cautiously.  
...  
All four of the identified amino acid insertions are extremely short and are found in the genomes of many other organisms, not just HIV. In other words, the primary finding of this work are entirely a highly expected coincidence.  
...  
In short, the authors base their analysis on a short sequence of the spike protein from 2019-nCoV, but a much more comprehensive search outside for the viral sequences queried in the manuscript demonstrates that this sequence is also found in \*many\* \*many\* other places than HIV. Thus, while the 2019-nCoV strain does appear to have a sequence difference from other closely related viruses, there is not enough resolution to clearly demonstrate the evolutionary history of this change let alone trace it to HIV.  
...  
I blasted each of the four 2019 - nCoV inserts shown in Table 1 and received 100% identity with a number of other hits other than HIV-1. For example, BLAST-P results for insert RSYLTPGDSSSG received 100% identity with Spike glycoprotein from a bat coronovirus with Genbank accession number GenBank: QHR63300.1. It is thus much closer to a known bat coronovirus than it is to HIV-1. Likewise each of the other three inserts have 100% amino acid identity to other non-HIV sources. The paper is thus highly misleading in that it does not discuss the other blast hits to non HIV-1 related sources, some of which have high identity than those from HIV-1. The implications of the paper that 2019 - nCoV coronovirus has elements of HIV-1 virus inserted into it should be treated with scepticism.

1. We know Beijing cannot be relied upon to abide by their treaties, including any treaties that ban biological weapons.

2. Coronavirus has HIV genes spliced into it. This is exceedingly unlikely to come from a random mutation.

3. Wuhan is a city where the PRC has facilities capable of creating chemical and biological weapons.

These three facts make the bioweapon scenario *very plausible*. Now of course this scenario hasn't been proven. But its a plausible theory that cannot be rejected out of hand. 

Do other plausible theories exist? Sure. We'll learn more and refine our understanding as knowledge grows.

1. How do these viruses materialize, from what seems like, ""out of thin air""? One day, no one knows what coronavirus is, the next day the whole world knows about it and is afraid of it. If it's due to a mutation of an already existing virus, how then would this particular virus NOT mutate further and become more of a problem? Could this have anything to do with global warming and ice melt? I had read somewhere that when the older ice starts to melt, the potential for ancient diseases and bacteria, long thought to be extinct, will begin to reemerge or redevelop because it was frozen and preserved in ice. Has this possibility been researched at all? (Sorry for all these layers!)


2. Why do these epidemics *seem* to be coming mostly from Asia and Africa, and not really from anywhere else? I (35f) personally can't recall the last time people were fleeing the United States, Canada, England, Northern Europe, etc., because of a ""deadly"" virus outbreak or other such epidemic. Is it due to hygienic and sanitation practices? Diet? Underdeveloped medical and/or disease control? Or are different places geographically just more prone to disease development than others?


3. In regards to question #2, how can the more developed countries help these underdeveloped countries prevent these outbreaks, if it is within human control? Even though some things would have ZERO ROI for the companies or financiers donating time, money, and/or materials to prevent further outbreaks like these, it would seem like it would be in *ANYONES* best interest to help where they can.


Thank you all for taking the time to answer our questions!"

#Cases

[As of Jan 31, 2020 7 pm ET](https://gisanddata.maps.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html#/bda7594740fd40299423467b48e9ecf6) we have total 11374 confirmed cases:

* 259 deaths
* 252 recovered
* 10863 unresolved 

From this we can calculate, that *out of the resolved cases*:

    (259 deaths) / (511 total resolved) = 51% died and 49% recovered

We have to keep in mind that it takes longer for person to recover than to die from the illness, and hospitals do tests only for the most severely ill ones, so the above calculation isn't a good representation of the actual chances of dying of this flu.

#World Health Organization

The only number given out by World Health Organization (WHO) so far has been a case fatality rate (CFR), which is the number of deaths divided by total confirmed cases. 

    (259 deaths) / (11374 confirmed cases) = 2% case fatality rate

While this is the correct way to calculate case fatality rate, this number doesn't give accurate estimation of the actual mortality rate of the flu, because it is an ongoing situation where majority of the confirmed cases are still unresolved. We don't have the information of whether the unresolved cases end up recovering or dying.

WHO themselves mentioned in the same [press conference](https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/media-resources/press-briefings#): ""*The only number currently known is how many people have died out of those who have been reported to the WHO...it is therefore very early to make any conclusive statements about what the overall mortality rate will be*"".

#The Lancet Study

https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(20)30211-7/fulltext

A study published in The Lancet tracked 99 confirmed cases from Wuhan Jinyintan Hospital. Death rate in that study was **11%**. We have to keep in mind that people in this study were not young an healthy to begin with.

#Reported Numbers vs Reality

The reported numbers only include those who have been tested positive for the virus. A lot of the actual infections will go undiagnosed because Chinese hospitals don't have enough test kits to test everyone. Also, majority of people with symptoms will choose to stay at home instead of going to the overcrowded hospitals where infected are gathered and spreading the virus around.  There have even been cases where people were tested positive for the virus and had no symptoms at all, so we really have no idea of the true number of infected people. However, we can safely assume that total number of infected is much much more than the reported confirmed cases.

There's also the very likely possibility that even the reported numbers are inaccurate, as China's officials could be reporting much lower numbers (of both infected and dead) for various political and economic reasons. 

Even if the true number of deaths would be a lot higher than reported, the actual number of infected could easily be higher than 200 000 which means the mortality rate is still low. It's very unlikely that mortality rate of this illness ends up being higher than **5%**.

#Comparison

For comparison, the case fatality rate of similar viruses and seasonal flu: 

* SARS (**11%**)
* MERS (**35%**)
* Seasonal Flu (**less than 0.01%.**)"

I basically almost quoted the entire article because everything else in that article argues against wearing masks when you don't need it. Even your own quote doesn't fully support your point 
>""Health experts tell TIME that such a move is probably effective **in the city, where a person is more likely to come in contact with someone who is infected than in other parts of the world.**""

We are in the ""other parts of the world"". Face masks are not necessary. I'm asking others not to use masks because they should save them for if (hopefully not) they fall sick. Because if people are sick and we run out of masks, then the situation will become really screwed up."

* The flu is not something we lack a vaccine for. 
* The flu does not commonly cause pneumonia.
* The flu is not a rapidly expanding virus, which means it is easier to cure and that it has a much lower chance of deadly mutations stacking up rapidly.
* Most importantly-- The flu isn't a virus that **just jumped species** to infect humans. Unlike the flu, coronavirus 2019-nCoV does not have a large portion of the population resistant to it via immunity/prior exposure.

Yes the flu virus kills many people each year. But that is a constant figure. When something new pops up--like SARS, ebola, MERS, the 1918 Spanish Flu, or now the coronavirus 2019-nCoV--it stands the potential\* to kill *millions* of people, not just 8,000.

Although cold viruses have been shown to survive on surfaces for several days, their ability to cause an infection reduces rapidly and they don't often survive longer than 24 hours.

Common cold virus (which is also a coronavirus) can last ‚Äúa couple hours to maybe a couple days,‚Äù depending on temperature, humidity, and other factors. The viruses can sometimes survive on indoor surfaces for more than 7 days. In general, viruses survive for longer on non-porous (water resistant) surfaces, such as stainless steel and plastics, than porous surfaces, such as fabrics and tissues.

Packets and goods from China usually take several weeks to arrive, so even if infected person was handling it and some viruses ended up on the surface, chances of the virus surviving is extremely small, practically zero."

During the 2009 swine flu pandemic, 11-21% of the global population contracted the H1N1 flu and it resulted in 150,000-575,000 deaths. In Wuhan coronavirus, the rate of infection and deaths are much lower - even if you disregard the Chinese government‚Äôs official reports, the highest estimated figures for the infected population is 90,000 people. This seems like a lot ‚Äî except thousands of people in North America alone die from the regular flu annually. In a country with a population of 1.4 billion, this is bound to be much higher and lots of people die from statistically unlikely causes all the time. 

Now you may say, ‚Äúwell then why did China quarantine multiple cities, that‚Äôs proof that all hell‚Äôs broken loose!‚Äù First of all, China has poor hygiene and sanitation practices, extremely densely populated urban areas, and inadequate healthcare resources and infrastructure - this means they need to take extreme precautionary measures, because all of these factors lead to much faster and widespread infection rates. In 2009, in response to the swine flu pandemic which originated in the US, China would screen flights that landed in their major population centres by sending a special team in hazmat suits on to the plane, taking the temperature of every single passenger on the plane, and quarantining anyone with an abnormal temperature AND passengers sitting within two rows of that person. Other nations were not this hyper-vigilant at the time, in spite of the fact that WHO had declared the swine flu pandemic as a public health emergency of international concern. After this pandemic, there were many critics that accused WHO of stoking fear because of how rapidly it tapered off, which prompted them to launch an internal investigation. 

All this to say, I‚Äôm baffled that people are so irrationally afraid of what is like any other illness, and Canadians especially should be the least worried given how sparsely populated we are and the relatively high standards of hygiene and sanitation. The swine flu pandemic wasn‚Äôt even that long ago but it seems like people have already forgotten how it unfolded."

Antigen screens can be performed but they're not typically recommended with the exception of severe pneumonia. 

I'm curious as to how the initial correlation was made because like the original commentor said there's so many viral and bacterial causes of pneumonia I wonder what test or type of panel they initially used to identify all of these patients as having  the coronavirus.

Dr. Konermann of Stanford just checked their results. The similarity is spurious. Out of 4 inserts they identify between NCov and SARS, 2 are found in bat coronavirus. Of the remaining two, only one is most similar to HIV, and is so short (6 AA) that the similarity is not higher than chance given database.
...
In fact, the Bat-SARS Like CoV, discovered in 2013, contains all the four insertions. Insertion 2 and 3 of 2019-nCoV are identical to Bat-SARS Like CoV. Insertion 1 involves two synonymous and one Thr-Ile mutation. Insertion 4 contains one synonymous mutation and a 12-bp insertion. Therefore, the two viruses have very high sequence similarity, and are likely evolutionarily related, naturally. Indeed, the four identified insertions are the result of the pair-wise comparison of Wuhan 2019-nCoV and 2013 SARS virus (Fig 1), and are an artifact when comparing only two viruses.
...
the alignment of the spike protein of the novel Coronavirus (protein ID QHD43416) with the bat spike protein mentioned by Jason Weir shows very high conservation (see attached image), particularly also in regards to the claimed ""inserts"" in Figure 2 of the preprint. This makes the bat Coronavirus a much more likely origin than the proposed connection to HIV.
...
I performed an alignment of these sequences and indeed found that these 4 insertions mentioned in the preprint are real. However I blasted each of these insertions to the non-redundant protein database and found over 100 hits for every single of these 4 insertions. The hits are others coronaviruses, plants, parasites, bacteria. This indicates the hits to HIV seems fortuitous and the evolutionary link between 2019-nCoV and HIV is to me not ascertained. Additionally, the authors in the manuscripts did not provide a e.value for their findings, nor they have explained in their methodology why they restricted their search for viral genomes only and not others organisms. Therefore I would argue that the results presented do not appear ""uncanny"" to me based on a flawed methodology. Therefore the results presented in this paper should be taken very cautiously.
...
All four of the identified amino acid insertions are extremely short and are found in the genomes of many other organisms, not just HIV. In other words, the primary finding of this work are entirely a highly expected coincidence.
...
In short, the authors base their analysis on a short sequence of the spike protein from 2019-nCoV, but a much more comprehensive search outside for the viral sequences queried in the manuscript demonstrates that this sequence is also found in *many* *many* other places than HIV. Thus, while the 2019-nCoV strain does appear to have a sequence difference from other closely related viruses, there is not enough resolution to clearly demonstrate the evolutionary history of this change let alone trace it to HIV.
...
I blasted each of the four 2019 - nCoV inserts shown in Table 1 and received 100% identity with a number of other hits other than HIV-1. For example, BLAST-P results for insert RSYLTPGDSSSG received 100% identity with Spike glycoprotein from a bat coronovirus with Genbank accession number GenBank: QHR63300.1. It is thus much closer to a known bat coronovirus than it is to HIV-1. Likewise each of the other three inserts have 100% amino acid identity to other non-HIV sources. The paper is thus highly misleading in that it does not discuss the other blast hits to non HIV-1 related sources, some of which have high identity than those from HIV-1. The implications of the paper that 2019 - nCoV coronovirus has elements of HIV-1 virus inserted into it should be treated with scepticism."

#Cases

[As of Jan 31, 2020 7 pm ET](https://gisanddata.maps.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html#/bda7594740fd40299423467b48e9ecf6) we have total 11374 confirmed cases:

* 259 deaths
* 252 recovered
* 10863 unresolved 

From this we can calculate, that *out of the resolved cases*:

    (259 deaths) / (511 total resolved) = 51% died and 49% recovered

We have to keep in mind that it takes longer for person to recover than to die from the illness, and hospitals do tests only for the most severely ill ones, so the above calculation isn't a good representation of the actual chances of dying of this flu.

#World Health Organization

The only number given out by World Health Organization (WHO) so far has been a case fatality rate (CFR), which is the number of deaths divided by total confirmed cases. 

    (259 deaths) / (11374 confirmed cases) = 2% case fatality rate

While this is the correct way to calculate case fatality rate, this number doesn't give accurate estimation of the actual mortality rate of the flu, because it is an ongoing situation where majority of the confirmed cases are still unresolved. We don't have the information of whether the unresolved cases end up recovering or dying.

WHO themselves mentioned in the same [press conference](https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/media-resources/press-briefings#): ""*The only number currently known is how many people have died out of those who have been reported to the WHO...it is therefore very early to make any conclusive statements about what the overall mortality rate will be*"".

#The Lancet Study

https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(20)30211-7/fulltext

A study published in The Lancet tracked 99 confirmed cases from Wuhan Jinyintan Hospital. Death rate in that study was **11%**. We have to keep in mind that people in this study were not young an healthy to begin with.

#Reported Numbers vs Reality

The reported numbers only include those who have been tested positive for the virus. A lot of the actual infections will go undiagnosed because Chinese hospitals don't have enough test kits to test everyone. Also, majority of people with symptoms will choose to stay at home instead of going to the overcrowded hospitals where infected are gathered and spreading the virus around.  There have even been cases where people were tested positive for the virus and had no symptoms at all, so we really have no idea of the true number of infected people. However, we can safely assume that total number of infected is much much more than the reported confirmed cases.

There's also the very likely possibility that even the reported numbers are inaccurate, as China's officials could be reporting much lower numbers (of both infected and dead) for various political and economic reasons. 

Even if the true number of deaths would be a lot higher than reported, the actual number of infected could easily be higher than 200 000 which means the mortality rate is still low. It's very unlikely that mortality rate of this illness ends up being higher than **5%**.

#Comparison

For comparison, the case fatality rate of similar viruses and seasonal flu: 

* SARS (**11%**)
* MERS (**35%**)
* Seasonal Flu (**less than 0.01%.**)"

By Tracy You For Mailonline17:02 GMT 31 Jan 2020¬†, updated¬†03:22 GMT 01 Feb 2020

Communities around¬†China¬†have ordered their residents to stop keeping pets - or risk getting them culled -¬†amid fears that animals could also catch the new¬†coronavirus¬†that has killed 213 in less than three weeks, MailOnline can reveal.

Residential committees, village officials and companies from various provinces and municipalities issued the strict order to locals after receiving instructions from their superiors to tackle the epidemic, it has emerged.

One village in Hebei urged all households to 'deal with' their pets within five days, otherwise officials would 'handle' them altogether; while another residential committee in Shaanxi instructed people to 'consider the overall situation' and dispose of their cats and dogs immediately, according to notices supplied to MailOnline.

The news came as¬†China's top expert for infectious diseases warned that pets would also need to be quarantined should they be exposed to coronavirus patients, causing fears that animals could also catch the disease.

The World Health Organisation, however, claims that it has not seen any evidence of the virus being passed onto cats or dogs.

In Wuhan, the ground zero of the coronavirus outbreak, one neighbourhood banned its residents from letting their cats, dogs and livestock leave their homes. In a flyer posted in the community, local officials threatened to catch, kill and bury the animals on the spot if they see any.¬†

While the authority of one residential complex in Shanghai forbade its residents from feeding stray animals to 'enforce the control and prevention of the epidemic', a separate document reads.¬†

Similar commands have appeared in provinces and municipalities across the country, including Beijing, Tianjin, Shandong, Heilongjiang, Hebei, Wuhan, Shanxi and Shanghai, according to animal welfare organisation¬†Humane Society International.¬†¬†


The city of Anshan in Liaoning Province instructed all pet markets to stop trading temporarily and its police forces to 'strictly restrict' residents from walking their pet dogs in public in an¬†urgent notice¬†released this week.¬†

It also banned the locals from flying their pigeons and demanded all stray wild¬†pigeons be culled as the outbreak accelerated.¬†

Dr Peter J. Li, China Policy Specialist of¬†Humane Society International, said the organisation had noticed memos¬†issued by Chinese local authorities ordering the banning and even killing of dogs and stray cats.¬†

'This is not the right approach for local authorities in China to deal with the national crisis that can be traced to China's out-of-control wildlife trade,' Dr Li told MailOnline.

'Companion animals did not contribute to the outbreak of SARS in 2002-2003. They do not have anything to do with the Wuhan epidemic,' he added.

In Dr Li's opinion, such orders could¬†undermine the national effort to curb the outbreak by 'pulling much needed efforts and resources away from the real battleground'.¬†

'Their acts also show that many of China's local officials lack the competency to run the Chinese society,' he concluded.¬†

One Beijing-based online vendor however told MailOnline that he was selling 10 times the number of special face masks for dogs every day than before as people were rushing to buy the protective covers for their pooches.¬†

The deadly Chinese coronavirus outbreak began at a wholesale animal market in Wuhan city, experts confirmed on Sunday.

Scientists from the Chinese Centre for Disease Control and Prevention said tests proved humans caught it from animals at the Huanan Seafood Wholesales Market.

It is not clear which animal was carrying the pneumonia-like illness but the market was home to stalls trading dozens of different species, including rats and wolf cubs.¬†

The coronavirus has now infected every region of¬†China. Chinese officials have now confirmed more than 9,750 cases, while more than 100 have been recorded outside of nation ‚Äì taking the toll to more than 9,900.

Deaths have also risen to 213, with 43 patients dying in one day - the biggest 24-hour jump since the outbreak began last month.¬†¬†

Your own link to the Lancet journal indicates this. Specifically, ""Phylogenetic analysis revealed that 2019-nCoV fell within the subgenus Sarbecovirus of the genus Betacoronavirus, with a relatively long branch length to its closest relatives bat-SL-CoVZC45 and bat-SL-CoVZXC21, and was genetically distinct from SARS-CoV."" Which is to say, it is not abnormal for a coronavirus at all. It's different, yes, as all different types of coronavirus are. The common cold is a coronavirus, and it's ""abnormal"" compared to SARS and compared to this new virus. That difference is relatively meaningless.

The journal article you've linked has been roundly criticized. In fact, your own Lancet journal article confounds their findings without intending to when they discuss the relationship between the genetic differences and the database profile. They even prognosticate a bit there about the most likely connections (hint, it's not HIV) on the way to indicating a third-party transmission between the bat forms, the animal intermediary, and its evolution into something with the ability for human transmission.

Your article about the Harvard researcher is unrelated and connected only by your paranoia. And just because a virus is ""new"" and ""different"" than other viruses does not mean that it is any more or less infectious or deadly. Viruses evolve novel forms *all the time;* this is partially why the flu shot changes every year. The R0 and mortality rate is still in dispute, but the idea that this is anything more than a naturally evolved viral mutation is absurd and and posting crap like this is irresponsible on your part."

I disagree, I think it's clear to draw the line at ""viable without requiring sustenance from a particular person's body."" Because that's the essential part where the woman's rights to bodily autonomy are violated.

The ultimate philosophical problem here is whether it is acceptable to force someone to do something good if they are the only one capable of doing it.

Imagine that a mutation in your blood is key to curing the Coronavirus. Even if it would save thousands of lives, it is very morally problematic to force you to donate blood against your will.

Exclusivity is key to this problem. If hundreds of people had this blood mutation, then the health agencies could just ask some other people if you say no.

Likewise with abortion, if it were practical to transfer the pregnancy to a willing woman, then it would present much less of a moral problem. Just as a nurse can reject you medical care and then they can find another nurse to take her place."

Its probably the higher number from Johns Hopkins' would be the more accurate figure, on the presumption that Johns Hopkins has correctly added the various data sets together; and Hopkins' stipulates *confirmed* cases. But the (passing and mildly) interesting thing is the disparity in data sets.

However, the population density of China is about 4 times higher, with Hubei province having ~60 million people.

Jack Ma Donates Ell Million

For Coronavirus Vaccine, Like

Average UK Household

Donating E 10

By Matt Novak on 31 Jan 2020 at 7:30PM

Ell million sounds generous, until you realise these billionaires

could donate a hundred times that amount and still be fine.

&#x200B;

I only know of three proper ways(some accurate, some very inaccurate) to calculate the mortality rate and both of them point to mortality rates higher than SARS. 

The first way is to track patients and track how many have died of those patients. 

Here we have two studies done that way, showing mortality of 11% to 15% :

[https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(20)30183-5/fulltext](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(20)30183-5/fulltext)

The other way is to divide dead/(dead+recovered).

Which comes out at 132/(132+110) = 54%

Another way is mathematically through median time of death and reverse exponent math which comes out to anywhere from 25% to 45%(I've done the math in another comment, I just took median time of death of 8-12 days, then divided current deaths by number of infections 8-12 days ago)."

#Cases

[As of Jan 31, 2020 7 pm ET](https://gisanddata.maps.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html#/bda7594740fd40299423467b48e9ecf6) we have total 11374 confirmed cases:

* 259 deaths
* 252 recovered
* 10863 unresolved 

From this we can calculate, that *out of the resolved cases*:

    (259 deaths) / (511 total resolved) = 51% died and 49% recovered

We have to keep in mind that it takes longer for person to recover than to die from the illness, and hospitals do tests only for the most severely ill ones, so the above calculation isn't a good representation of the actual chances of dying of this flu.

#World Health Organization

The only number given out by World Health Organization (WHO) so far has been a case fatality rate (CFR), which is the number of deaths divided by total confirmed cases. 

    (259 deaths) / (11374 confirmed cases) = 2% case fatality rate

While this is the correct way to calculate case fatality rate, this number doesn't give accurate estimation of the actual mortality rate of the flu, because it is an ongoing situation where majority of the confirmed cases are still unresolved. We don't have the information of whether the unresolved cases end up recovering or dying.

WHO themselves mentioned in the same [press conference](https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/media-resources/press-briefings#): ""*The only number currently known is how many people have died out of those who have been reported to the WHO...it is therefore very early to make any conclusive statements about what the overall mortality rate will be*"".

#The Lancet Study

https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(20)30211-7/fulltext

A study published in The Lancet tracked 99 confirmed cases from Wuhan Jinyintan Hospital. Death rate in that study was **11%**. We have to keep in mind that people in this study were not young an healthy to begin with.

#Reported Numbers vs Reality

The reported numbers only include those who have been tested positive for the virus. A lot of the actual infections will go undiagnosed because Chinese hospitals don't have enough test kits to test everyone. Also, majority of people with symptoms will choose to stay at home instead of going to the overcrowded hospitals where infected are gathered and spreading the virus around.  There have even been cases where people were tested positive for the virus and had no symptoms at all, so we really have no idea of the true number of infected people. However, we can safely assume that total number of infected is much much more than the reported confirmed cases.

There's also the very likely possibility that even the reported numbers are inaccurate, as China's officials could be reporting much lower numbers (of both infected and dead) for various political and economic reasons. 

Even if the true number of deaths would be a lot higher than reported, the actual number of infected could easily be higher than 200 000 which means the mortality rate is still low. It's very unlikely that mortality rate of this illness ends up being higher than **5%**.

#Comparison

For comparison, the case fatality rate of similar viruses and seasonal flu: 

* SARS (**11%**)
* MERS (**35%**)
* Seasonal Flu (**less than 0.01%.**)"

If we‚Äôre really going to talk Bayes, did you know what a biosafety level 4 facility was, that there was one in Wuhan, China, and that it held deadly coronaviruses in that one specifically, on, say, Nov 1, 2019? (Assuming all of those things are true.)

Or did you learn this information afterwards from someone else who chose to call attention to it?

This is statistics 101. Paint the target around the bullet hold and you never miss. I‚Äôm not saying that that‚Äôs 100% what‚Äôs happening here, but you‚Äôre not going to the effort necessary to dissuade people from thinking that‚Äôs what‚Äôs happening, and that should be the primary job of someone trying to advance this kind of narrative.

Advancing a conspiracy-theory narrative, the bar should be pretty high. Instead of just say ‚Äúnear a biosafety level 4 facility‚Äù, you need to say how near and how many of these there are in China - for all I know there could be one in every mid-sized city. Next, is it unusual for a lab in China, which has previously suffered from coronavirus outbreaks, that is studying virus outbreaks, to have frozen coronaviruses? Intuitively... no? So that doesn‚Äôt seem like particularly good evidence of something amiss.

These are just examples of the kind of thing I think you should do before advancing this kind of narrative."

I think that you're being really, really smart by planning this far ahead. Hays is a Department of Education grant (unless that's been changed in the past few years) and, in my experience, they're a bit more flexible than the IIE grants. That being said, the change that I asked for was minimal (a little bit of change on the time spent in each country I was going to, because I'd also gotten another grant that allowed me to add another year) and resulted in a slight pay decrease because the cost of living calculation was then lower.

If I remember correctly‚Äîand it's been a little over a decade for me‚Äîthe Department of Education grants are made from the DoE to your graduate institution, which in turn acts as the grant administrator. The DoS grants, on the other hand, are administered by the IIE, which is a big org that administers thousands of them a year.

First thing I'd do is read the [full DDRA grant documentation](https://www2.ed.gov/programs/iegpsddrap/ddraapplication2019.pdf). 2019 version linked; it was the first one that turned up in the google search but if that's not the administrative year yours is under, find that one.

Unless the documentation above strictly prohibits this, what I would do is file the request as a formal site change, filed to your campus administrators (who may in the DDRA terminology be called the grant director?)‚ÄîI'm presuming you've got an admin in your corner, here‚Äîthat would then be filed by them to the DoE.

Items to include (I'd make this into a packet with a table of contents):

* a one-paragraph abstract of your research, with the title with which it got approved for the Hays
* a one-paragraph abstract of your updated proposed work, with an updated title (this is really relevant only if your site was mentioned in either your abstract or title); don't include this second abstract if it's unaffected
* a section that proposes the change/s you want to make, with the rationale for that change. 

1. Including CDC and Department of State travel advisory quotes is definitely something I'd do here. 
2. I'd also include an itinerary change, at whatever granularity your initial itinerary proposal was. If you had a single-site proposal you don't need much here, but I'd include the reasons for the selection of your updated site. If you were proposing affiliation/planning on working with any research institutions in the PRC, include an explainer on either how you will still work with that institution/s or update the institution to reflect current plans
3. Proposed budget change. Because the DoE grants calculate cost of living by published amounts (I believe it's the Department of State Cost of Living Index), changing your proposed site will have budgetary implications. Propose that change.

* **a letter from your graduate advisor**, signed and on university letterhead, that addresses your proposed changes.

With that being said, let's look at some numbers. The population of China is is roughly 1.3 billion. The number of confirmed cases in China has recently reached just under 12,000. That means only 0.0009% of the population has contracted the virus. The vast majority of these cases are located in the Hubei province, of which Wuhan is the capital. Anyone coming to the US from that province is subjected to a 14-day quarantine.

Of the roughly 12,000 confirmed cases, there are under 300 fatalities, which comes out to a 2-3% fatality rate. 

Only 7 cases have been confirmed in the US.

In contrast, during the 2018-19 flu outbreak in the US, the CDC estimates that 35.5 million people were infected at some point, of which 34,200 people died.

So far, the likelihood of you just being infected (not dying) by the coronavirus pales in comparison to the likelihood of actually dying from influenza."

Maybe he was one of those 80% who did not developed severe pneumonia thanx to excellent care from the begining, but...

> ....many more would become severely ill and need hospital care. How many? Right now the WHO estimates 20%. https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.nytimes.com/article/what-is-coronavirus.amp.html Some of them will be critically ill with Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome and multiple organ failure (common complications of this virus), requiring ICU level care with full ventilation. There are only a hundred thousand or so ICU beds in the entire United States, a highly developed first world country. Even if only a small percentage of the 7.2 million severely ill people in America need ICU treatment to survive (assuming the lower 11% infection figure), you‚Äôre easily exceeding the entire country‚Äôs ICU capacity many times over. And, of course, ICU beds don‚Äôt just sit around empty all the time when there is no pandemic around, and people don‚Äôt stop needing the ICU for other non-pandemic things just because a pandemic is happening. The same applies to regularly staffed hospital beds, of which America only has roughly a million of. To treat 7.2 million severely ill people. On the low end. Now imagine you live in West Africa or a poorer district of India - how do you think the hospital situation there would fare with such influx?
> 
> So you can see why a pandemic coronavirus is likely not on the same level as the common flu or heart disease or whatever random common thing people online are comparing it to. If it happens, it will be a highly memorable world event, killing perhaps a fourth to a half as many people who died in World War 2 - assuming no more than 20% of people in the world catch it, and assuming health care can keep up so that otherwise manageable cases aren‚Äôt triaged or just neglected into a fatality, which might be asking a lot. In a ‚Äúreally bad‚Äù scenario, 100 million plus deaths across the globe is probably not out of the question. At some point it gets bad enough that you have to start taking into account the effect of collapsed supply chains, production shortages, and breakdowns in civil order. Which is way beyond back of the envelope.

No vaccine for a year. People who recover are still contagious (news just out today). That means everyone who has it will have to be in isolation for a whole year. There are simply not enough resources for millions of people to be in isolation.

1. There is logically a latency between the date you are infected and the date of death, so the death rate on any given day does not reflect the amount of deaths for the total amount of those currently infected on that day.
2. This is even more complicated by reports that medical centers in china are overloaded, and have a limited supply of test kits and other resources. This is why there is an explosion of suspected cases as well. This means the we are only seeing confirmed cases they have capacity to report.
3. Another variable would be the fact that deaths of unconfirmed cases may not be reported as official deaths due to the virus because resources may be too limited to test deceased individuals. Whether unconfirmed cause of deaths are or not attributable, we'll probably never know, especially if bodies are being cremated.
4. The point is, the death rate being reported is the absolute minimum. It seems logical that they would only be attributing deaths to the virus after having confirmed those deaths be a result of the virus. Therefore, the notion of any unconfirmed cause of death of unconfirmed cases or suspected cases or overloaded capcity to confirm cases leads me to postulate that the death rate is higher than 2.2%. This is before even considering the latency of the infections progressing. I will change my tune when I see reporting of there being testing for the virus in cases where there was a death, but no testing had been performed while the suspected case was living.
5. Assuming an overwhelmed hospital would choose to care for more serious cases (i.e. can't breath, severe pneumonia) vs less serious cases (cough, sniffle, etc) the fatality rate reported by that hospital will likely be skewed higher by more serious cases being more likely to be admitted and being more likely to result in fatality, and less serious cases will go unreported and may resolve themselves and never be counted.

The TLDR - any mortality rate you assign to this is entirely speculation and calling it any higher or lower than influenza to try and convince people their concerns are baseless is not helpful.

The closest to accurate we have are studies that follow a subset of cases all the way to resolution. A study like the one in the lancet ([Lancet Study](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(20)30183-5/fulltext)) 6 out of 41 died (15%) But this is too small of a sample size to extrapolate to general populations so I take this with a grain of salt."

It seems as though the last straw came when ZH outed the individual that they say was responsible for the coronavirus -- seems like Twitter said that was doxxing and grounds for a ban.

It seems unusual to me that ZH can't name the scientist they thought was responsible, yet a reporter can name ZH leading to their ban. How does something like this work, you can only point at people if you're an approved reporter? I mean the two ""doxxing"" events were roughly similar, where each outed who they thought was doing harm in the world. 

What I didn't like about ZH's reaction was that they want to find excuses to make it seem like they should be unbanned. They were saying ""we didn't point him out, we were just asking questions"". Instead they should be proud of their reporting and responded that it was an important new event and someone needed to report on it. It's the same as when nobody will report on the Trump whistleblower name. 

>  the libertarian community has a severe alt-right problem, and Zero Hedge is just further proof of such a thing.

If anything the libertarian needs more extremism. not that nationalism (alt-right) is the way to go, but centrism is the worst thing for libertarians."

Yes influenza is bad.

But 

You simply cannot compare the fatality rate of the coronavirus to anything by using the amount of deaths compared to the amount of cases on any given day at this stage in the outbreak. 

1. There is logically a latency between the date you are infected and the date of death, so the death rate on any given day does not reflect the amount of deaths for the total amount of those currently infected on that day.
2. This is even more complicated by reports that medical centers in china are overloaded, and have a limited supply of test kits and other resources.  This is why there is an explosion of suspected cases as well.
3. Another variable would be the fact that deaths of unconfirmed cases may not be reported as official deaths due to the virus. Whether they are or not attributable, we'll probably never know, especially if bodies are being cremated.
4. The point is, the death rate being reported is the absolute minimum. It seems logical that they would only be attributing deaths to the virus after having confirmed those deaths be a result of the virus. Therefore, the notion of any unconfirmed cause of death of unconfirmed cases or suspected cases lead me to postulate that the death rate is higher than 2.2%. This is before even considering the latency the infections progressing. I will change my tune when I see reporting of there being testing for the virus in cases where there was a death, but no testing had been performed while the suspected case was living.

&#x200B;

The TLDR - any mortality rate you assign to this is entirely speculation and calling it any higher or lower than influenza to try and convince people their concerns are baseless is not helpful. 

The closest to accurate we have are studies that follow a subset of cases all the way to resolution. A study like the one in the lancet ([Lancet Study](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(20)30183-5/fulltext)) 6 out of 41 died (15%) But this is too small of a sample size so I take this with a grain of salt."

Coronavirus (and influenza) are  species-crossing viruses, opportunely infecting pigs, birds, and humans with complete disregard for what sort of critter their new host is. In a rural environment, where traditional small farmers live in close contact with their animals and there is little to no health regulation, there is a highly increased chance that the pigs can pick up a virus from the ducks, shuffle the genes around, and come up with a novel virus that then infects the farmer. This cycle can repeat several times as the virus goes through the human-pig-bird reinfection, changing every time. Open markets where live animals are crowded into small enclosures also contribute. Sooner or later, infected animals wind up in an open market, as in Wuhan, and far more people than the farmer and his family are exposed. 

In parts of the world where Big Agribiz has taken over markets you don't get that mixing of species. It's highly unlikely that you will get a respiratory illness from the chicken that comes in a plastic-wrapped tray from the supermarket."

While we don‚Äôt know for sure that this virus will behave the same way as SARS and MERS, we can use the information from both of these earlier coronaviruses to guide us. **In general, because of poor survivability of these coronaviruses on surfaces, there is likely very low risk of spread from products or packaging that are shipped over a period of days or weeks at ambient temperatures.** Coronaviruses are generally thought to be spread most often by respiratory droplets. **Currently there is no evidence to support transmission of 2019-nCoV associated with imported goods and there have not been any cases of 2019-nCoV in the United States associated with imported goods.**"

Alex Crits-Christoph ‚Ä¢ 2 hours ago

All four of the identified amino acid insertions are extremely short and are found in the genomes of many other organisms, not just HIV. In other words, the primary finding of this work are entirely a highly expected coincidence.

All organisms contain a DNA code that has the genetic instructions for development, functioning, and growth - this is known as the ""genome"". You can imagine each genome as a book of instructions. What these authors did is look in the genome book of the 2019 novel coronavirus and identified 4 sets of letters that aren't found in the genome book of SARs, a related coronavirus. They then compared these letters to the genome book of HIV, and found some places where they looked somewhat similar - but not even identical. However, because these sets of letters were so short, they are often found in many genome books by chance - they way you might search for the phrase ""can be there"" in Google Books and find that thousands of books contain those words - but this is not an example of plagarism.

Note here: We call these sets of letters ""insertions"" because they are in one genome, but not in a close relative - ""insertion"" does not imply human interference or engineering - it is an evolutionary term and refers to a natural evolutionary mutation.

Here are the four insertions:

TNGTKR

HKNNKS

RSYLTPGDSSSG

QTNSPRRA

These four insertions are protein sequences, that are encoded by a DNA sequence (which you may know uses molecular ""letters"" of A, G, C, and T to encode for proteins, which uses 20 molecular amino acid ""letters"").

You, dear reader, do not have to take anybody's word for it that these letters are a concidence - you can do the bioinformatics yourself!

If you would go to: https://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi

You will arrive at a search engine for these genome books, kind of like the Google of biology. Click on ""Protein Blast"", because are going to search for these protein sequences.

Under where it says ""Enter accession number"", you can paste any one of the four sequences above.

And then you can hit the ""BLAST"" button at the bottom of the screen. In a few minutes you will get a set of results.

Let's go through the results for the longest sequence, ""RSYLTPGDSSSG"", together.

Under the ""Description"" field you can see resulting hits. The first hit you see is to ""spike glycoprotein [Wuhan seafood market pneumonia virus]"" - this is good, because we know that this sequence came from this genome. Under ""Per. Id"" you can see the similarity of this sequence to other hits - in this case, you can start by seeing that this sequence is also found in Bat coronavirus, so isn't actually novel at all! And there are many comparative hits that as equally as good, or often better, than the HIV comparison.

Let's then take a look at the second sequence, ""HKNNKS"", together.

If you go through the same search process for this sequence and look again at the results, you can see hundreds of perfectly identical matches. Maybe you see Sipha flava - that's an Aphid, or Tetrahymena - that's an Amoeba. Drosophila is a fruit fly. Clearly this sequence is found in thousands of genomes.

Fortunately, the search has a built in way of answering the question ""How likely was this result to have occurred by chance?"". It is called the E-value, or Expect Value - the number of times we'd expect to see this result purely by chance. As you can see here, many of the E-values listed on this page are greater than 7829 - so we'd have expected to see 7829 instances of matches like these completely by chance! This is not evidence for gene transfer or gene similarity - it's simply a coincidence. As you now search for the other insertions described by this paper, you'll see that all of them hit hundreds of other genomes simply by chance. It is no surprise at all that they could have matches with some similarity in the HIV genome.

Congratulations! You are now a more careful and proficient bioinformatician than the authors of this paper."

#Cases

[As of Feb 1, 2020 10 am ET] (https://gisanddata.maps.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html#/bda7594740fd40299423467b48e9ecf6) we have total 12024 confirmed cases:

* 259 deaths
* 287 recovered
* 11478 unresolved 

From this we can calculate, that *out of the resolved cases*:

    (259 deaths) / (543 total resolved) = 47% died and 53% recovered

We have to keep in mind that it takes longer for person to recover than to die from the illness, and hospitals do tests only for the most severely ill ones, so the above calculation isn't a good representation of the actual chances of dying of this flu.

#World Health Organization

The only number given out by World Health Organization (WHO) so far has been a case fatality rate (CFR), which is the number of deaths divided by total confirmed cases. 

    (259 deaths) / (12024 confirmed cases) = 2% case fatality rate

While this is the correct way to calculate case fatality rate, this number doesn't give accurate estimation of the actual mortality rate of the flu, because it is an ongoing situation where majority of the confirmed cases are still unresolved. We don't have the information of whether the unresolved cases end up recovering or dying.

WHO themselves mentioned in the same [press conference](https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/media-resources/press-briefings#): ""*The only number currently known is how many people have died out of those who have been reported to the WHO...it is therefore very early to make any conclusive statements about what the overall mortality rate will be*"".

#The Lancet Study

https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(20)30211-7/fulltext

A study published in The Lancet tracked 99 confirmed cases from Wuhan Jinyintan Hospital. Death rate in that study was **11%**. We have to keep in mind that people in this study were not young an healthy to begin with.

#Reported Numbers vs Reality

The reported numbers only include those who have been tested positive for the virus. A lot of the actual infections will go undiagnosed because Chinese hospitals don't have enough test kits to test everyone. Also, majority of people with symptoms will choose to stay at home instead of going to the overcrowded hospitals where infected are gathered and spreading the virus around.  There have even been cases where people were tested positive for the virus and had no symptoms at all, so we really have no idea of the true number of infected people. However, we can safely assume that total number of infected is much much more than the reported confirmed cases.

There's also the very likely possibility that even the reported numbers are inaccurate, as China's officials could be reporting much lower numbers (of both infected and dead) for various political and economic reasons. 

Even if the true number of deaths would be a lot higher than reported, the actual number of infected could easily be higher than 200 000 which means the mortality rate is still low. It's very unlikely that mortality rate of this illness ends up being higher than **5%**.

#Comparison

For comparison, the case fatality rate of similar viruses and seasonal flu: 

* SARS (**11%**)
* MERS (**35%**)
* Seasonal Flu (**less than 0.01%.**)"

1. My dad is the kind of person who, when hes stressed or upset, hes angry. Those feelings frustrate him. My mom does one of two things, she will either try to approach from a soothing side or if it's not working she will snap back ESPECIALLY if he snaps at us when we dont deserve it. May I suggest to start ""Honey, I know that you are stressed and concerned. The children dont know about all that, they just love you. Is there something we can do to ease your stress? Maybe stop trying for a baby for now. And keep tissues around the house? You cannot yell at them for things they cant help."" 

(Sidenote: my mom is a nurse. The before genuinely doesnt seem like germophobia, it's just what doctors and nurses do when they work with who knows what bacteria, viruses and spores. It's pretty common for the medical field in general. Which leads to my next point)



2. The coronavirus is probably making him EXTREMELY anxious. People have to be extra careful now. Theres human to human transmission in Europe as well as Asia and we can catch it even if people havent shown symptoms. That's scary. But that doesnt mean it's okay to lash out at your children for him being sick."

Although MERS is a different than nCOV, they are both coronaviruses, suggesting that remdesivir should be tested for its efficacy against nCOV.

‚ÄúMiddle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) is the causative agent of a severe respiratory disease associated with more than 2468 human infections and over 851 deaths in 27 countries since 2012. There are no approved treatments for MERS-CoV infection although a combination of lopinavir, ritonavir and interferon beta (LPV/RTV-IFNb) is currently being evaluated in humans in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. Here, we show that remdesivir (RDV) and IFNb have superior antiviral activity to LPV and RTV in vitro. In mice, both prophylactic and therapeutic RDV improve pulmonary function and reduce lung viral loads and severe lung pathology. In contrast, prophylactic LPV/RTV-IFNb slightly reduces viral loads without impacting other disease parameters. Therapeutic LPV/RTV-IFNb improves pulmonary function but does not reduce virus replication or severe lung pathology. Thus, we provide in vivo evidence of the potential for RDV to treat MERS-CoV infections.‚Äù

114 samples in British Columbia(there may be multiple testing in some cases), only 1 positive hit.

Ballpark around 1 in 50-100 for an actual case from the need for testing(already high risk factors and likely some symptoms) in a place like British Columbia with aggressive monitoring measures and significant travel with China.

I am not sure about the Ontario numbers, but with 3 cases, my guess is ~300 tests.

Notice that Canada seems to be double testing and using highly sensitive test at the national laboratory to be sure even with small viral load and it already caught a false negative case.

I think anyone that got a negative test should still be recommended to be isolated(or practice heavy social distancing) until the second test and wear face masks with any travel history to China or close contact with someone that did. And even if it is just the flu, wearing a face mask will help overall to prevent the health care system from overloading.  I never understand why North Americans don't like face mask, any sick person should consider a face mask and wear it."

There probably aren't a lot of Chinese people looking to fly to Canada right now anyway. Still... why risk it?

I live in far north east China in the province of Heilongjiang. 

Funny story: I was supposed to fly to Egype today with a good friend.  I went on holiday on the 18th of last month, but most people started their holiday on the 21st.

So around the 24th i wanna say this news really blew up BIG TIME and I ask my buddy ""we still on? If you're up for it I am, but you're older and if this thing gets you, you could be in a world f trouble"" and he's like ""no way we're skipping out on Egypt""

I think that was on the 25th or the 26th. Anyhow I called up 1 day later and he's like ""Screw this. If we go to Egypt we probably won't be able to get back into China.""

Then there's my boss. She was supposed to travel to Vancouver with a business partner on the 28th. But on the 27th the company they were supposed to meet with were like ""hi, we'd love to do business with you, but we think it's not a good time. How about after there's no risk. Thanks!""

The vast majority of people in China aren't in the mood to travel right now. I haven't been outside in over a week, but there are a lot of middle aged and older lower and middle class people who are kinda ignorant to how germs and bacteria work. They aren't the people who are coming to visit Canada. 

Sad fact of the reality is that they've probably got friends and family who are. These people whom I've labeled as ignorant are still going out in public without masks on to find a group activity to take part in (Majong or square dancing but not the kind square dancing you're thinking of for example.) despite the fact that the government actually extended the Lunar new year holiday in hopes that it would keep people inside their homes with their families. 

You can find photos and videos now of police officers going into majong halls smashing the majong tables to pieces and kicking everyone out in a non-violent fashion. If you didn't know the context looking at these photos you'd feel horrible for these seniors, but they were really raised in a different time.

While this generation of young adults doesn't respect the danger of bacteria and germs and buy into the whole hygiene thing (on average) as much as a lot of westerners do, they're 10,000% better than their predecessors and that they should be praised for it, but in the end it doesn't really matter.

It's really hard to tell elders what to do in China because they've made a lot of sacrifices. I don't even need to go back as far as the cultural revolution to give an example. The very life the Chinese people buy into living demands that they can do things their way when they get older.

* Imagine having 2-4 hours of homework a night when your'e in primary school grade 1. (2-4 hours depending on how well you learned to write Chinese characters in KINDERGARTEN.)
* Imagine reading so much in kindergarten that you've got super thick glasses before primary school.
* Imagine studying so much in dry stuffy rooms and middle school and high school that you get nosebleeds all the time.
* Now you're finished high school. University is a little more lax. And it's REALLY fun if you do really well on your university entrance exam. If you don't, then you're either going to a crappy university (and getting a crappy job) or you'll go to a decent university and the university will dictate what classes you will take. You'll pay full price and you're going to major in botany, because nobody is taking the classes and we want to be able to offer these classes so that we can brag about the wide range of classes our university offers.

OK so you're blind, didn't have much time to play as a kid because you studied all the time and got a freaking degree in botany, which you're never going to use. But you're out of university. You're finished working. Home free now right?

* When I came to China everyone thought you were a loser if you were 30 and not married. So parents were pushing their kids to marry before 28 so that nobody would suspect that the person was going to turn out to be one of those ""losers."" Let's just say that 25 is the new 28. If you've got a traditional family (it's not as common as before but still the VAST majority of the nation.) and you can't find a suitable person to marry your family will find you one. They won't force you to do it, **but you will agree** in the end because that's how things go.

So you're 25, blind, don't know how to have fun, got a desk job working for some state owned company where you just fill out paperwork all day and you've got this stranger you've known for about 2 months whom you now refer to as your spouse. 

GUESS WHAT? In a year or two, your parents are gonna start talking about BABIES! That's right! You need to be a parent. Don't worry about getting to know your spouse. You're going gonna be a mommy, daddy before your 28th birthday. The longest you wait the less fertile your body will be so there's no time like the present!

The story goes on. But sufficive to say there's a reason why a lot of middle aged and older people do whatever they want to do and because of that it really is a risk to let Chinese people into Canada unless Canada has a 100% reliable way to test/screen people for the coronavirus coming when they land. 

**If someone you know has the coronavirus. They should be getting rich. They should be suing the pants off of the government because the only reason why they got sick is because Canada doesn't want to seem firm or rash when dealing with a virus which is known to be immune to pharmaceuticals.** 

The one thing that really makes me feel all weirded out is the fact that if a bunch of people in Canada get this disease everyone is going to stay in their homes and stop spending so much money and if that happens the already weak Canadian economy is going to tank. 

Really hope that in the very near future the Canadian government changes is song so that I don't need to worry about reading news stories about Canada having hundreds of cases and having to recheck the source to make sure it wasn't reported by 4Chan, the Beaverton or the Onion.

Happy Lunar New Year and stay safe!"

China is not fudging/lying about their numbers. Their problem is the testing *capacity*, not that they're lying about their numbers.

Apple announced on Saturday that it is temporarily closing all of its stores in China, as officials scramble to stem a fast-moving coronavirus outbreak that has already killed more than 200 people inside the country.

""Out of an abundance of caution and based on the latest advice from leading health experts, we're closing all our corporate offices, stores and contact centers in mainland China through February 9,"" the company said in a statement.
Apple operates¬†more than 40 stores¬†in mainland China.
Most Apple products are made in China in factories owned and operated by outside contractors, including the electronics giant Foxconn.

For now, the Taiwan-based Foxconn says it won't be changing¬†its production timeline, but in a Jan. 28¬†earnings call, Apple CEO Tim Cook said the company is working on backup plans to minimize any potential¬†supply disruptions.
With its announcement on Saturday,¬†Apple joins a growing list of major American companies ‚Äî including¬†Starbucks, McDonald's and KFC ‚Äî in suspending business in China.

Su suegro hab√≠a fallecido, uno de los m√°s de 200 v√≠ctimas mortales del [coronavirus](//elpais.com/sociedad/2020/01/31/actualidad/1580446218_765096.html) que asuela esa ciudad. El individuo al que un informe policial publicado este viernes identifica como Ke no pudo contenerse. Se abalanz√≥ sobre dos m√©dicos y comenz√≥ a golpearlos, arranc√°ndoles la ropa protectora. Se encuentra ahora bajo custodia policial.

 Es un incidente m√°s de los muchos que dejan en evidencia estos d√≠as la furia del p√∫blico en torno a una crisis, la [epidemia de coronavirus](//elpais.com/tag/ncov/a/), de la que culpan a la desastrosa gesti√≥n de las autoridades locales de Wuhan y su provincia, Hubei. Una epidemia que ya ha infectado a cerca de 10.000 personas y en la que, pese al refuerzo de los suministros y al env√≠o de miles de m√©dicos y sanitarios adicionales, [sigue faltando material protector suficiente en los hospitales](//elpais.com/sociedad/2020/01/25/actualidad/1579928257_278133.html) y doctores y enfermeras se encuentran al borde del agotamiento.

 La tensi√≥n entre el Gobierno central -dispuesto a acabar con la epidemia y el descontento de la oblaci√≥n a toda costa-, y unas autoridades locales que quieren evitar que se les responsabilice del caos, es evidente estos d√≠as, en los que llueven las acusaciones del uno y el otro lado. Y el escal√≥n m√°s bajo lleva las de perder. Seg√∫n la revista *Southern Weekly*, ya 33 funcionarios de nivel municipal o provincial han sido destituidos, amonestados o se les ha abierto un expediente por mala gesti√≥n de la crisis.

 Al malestar por el desbordamiento en los centros sanitarios se ha sumado la publicaci√≥n de una serie de informaciones cient√≠ficas que corroboran las sospechas de que se ocult√≥ informaci√≥n clave al p√∫blico durante las primeras semanas, mientras el problema se hac√≠a cada vez mayor en diciembre y la mayor parte de enero.

 Un informe de un numeroso grupo de expertos oficiales chinos, que publicaba el mi√©rcoles el New England Journal of Medicine, encontraba, tras examinar los primeros 425 casos de infecci√≥n en Wuhan, que [los contagios entre seres humanos empezaron a darse desde mediados de diciembre](//elpais.com/sociedad/2020/01/29/actualidad/1580309595_830193.html). Pero las autoridades insistieron en que no hab√≠a indicios de ello. Finalmente, se admiti√≥ el 20 de enero, cuando la propagaci√≥n de la epidemia comenz√≥ a dispararse.

 ‚ÄúDecir que estoy furioso es quedarme corto. No tengo palabras‚Äù, publicaba en Weibo, el Twitter chino, el catedr√°tico de Biolog√≠a en la Universidad de Zhejiang Wang Liming, tras leer el informe, ‚Äúes la primera prueba s√≥lida de que se ocult√≥ intencionadamente que hab√≠a contagios entre humanos‚Äù. Su mensaje desde entonces ha sido borrado.

 Buena parte de las iras se dirigen no contra el Gobierno central -el consenso entre la mayor√≠a de la poblaci√≥n es que las cosas han mejorado desde que ha tomado el [control de la crisis](//elpais.com/sociedad/2020/01/25/actualidad/1579974015_381505.html)-, sino contra las autoridades provinciales de Hubei y el alcalde de Wuhan, Zhou Xianwang, una figura que parece tener los d√≠as contados en el cargo. El √∫ltimo en arremeter contra √©l ha sido el epidemi√≥logo jefe en el Centro de Prevenci√≥n y Control de Enfermedades, Zeng Guang. En una entrevista con el peri√≥dico estatal Global Times, ha apuntado que el gobierno municipal de Wuhan pudo haber tardado en responder a la crisis ‚Äúprincipalmente por la falta de conocimientos cient√≠ficos‚Äù sobre el nuevo tipo de coronavirus, pero tambi√©n por ‚Äúcierta indecisi√≥n en la toma de medidas‚Äù.

 Durante esas primeras semanas vitales, seg√∫n las cr√≠ticas, Zhou no solo tard√≥ en ofrecer informaci√≥n, sino que actu√≥ de modo que, a todas luces, contribuy√≥ a diseminar la infecci√≥n. A principios de enero organizaba una comida con 40.000 personas para batir un r√©cord de participaci√≥n. E insist√≠a en que la gente se fuera de vacaciones para el A√±o Nuevo lunar: antes del cierre por cuarentena el d√≠a 23, se hab√≠an marchado de la ciudad cinco millones de personas.

 Tambi√©n se le acusa de haber intentado suprimir informaci√≥n. El 1 de enero, la Polic√≠a de Wuhan anunci√≥ que hab√≠a tomado ‚Äúmedidas legales‚Äù contra ocho personas sospechosas de ‚Äúdifundir rumores‚Äù -un cargo que puede suponer hasta siete a√±os de c√°rcel- por denunciar que esos casos de enfermedad extra√±a que se hab√≠an detectado parec√≠an SARS. El S√≠ndrome Respiratorio Agudo Severo, originado tambi√©n en China y que mat√≥ a casi 800 personas en todo el mundo en 2003, est√° causado por otro coronavirus de la misma familia que el actual.

 Esta semana, la Polic√≠a ha retirado las acusaciones contra los ocho, despu√©s de que el Tribunal Supremo se mostrara muy cr√≠tico contra la actuaci√≥n de ese cuerpo. ‚ÄúHubiera sido una suerte si la gente los hubiera cre√≠do (los ‚Äòrumores‚Äô), y hubiera empezado a llevar mascarillas y tomar medidas de precauci√≥n‚Äù, se ha lamentado.

 En una entrevista televisada el lunes, Zhou reconoci√≥ que su Ayuntamiento no divulg√≥ la informaci√≥n necesaria en cuanto la tuvo a mano y ofreci√≥ su dimisi√≥n. Pero, en una acusaci√≥n inusualmente directa contra estamentos m√°s altos de poder, asegur√≥ que no lo hizo porque no ten√≠a permiso de arriba para revelarla. ‚ÄúComo gobierno local, solo podemos informar (sobre una enfermedad infecciosa) con una autorizaci√≥n‚Äù."

Interesting findings: 2/3 men : 1/3 female, 30% complication rate    

>The researchers based the study on 99 patients ‚Äì 67 men and 32 women ‚Äì admitted to the Wuhan hospital from January 1 to 20. It found that almost half of them were infected in clusters, though Chinese health authorities only confirmed that cases were being transmitted between humans on January 21.  

>‚ÄúWe observed a greater number of men than women in the 99 cases of 2019-nCoV infection. Mers-CoV and Sars-CoV have also been found to infect more males than females,‚Äù the study said, referring to Middle East respiratory syndrome and severe acute respiratory syndrome, which are also coronaviruses.

True. SARS, another coronavirus, doesn't also have a vaccine.  
 
> This infects before symptoms show, while symptoms are showing, while the patient is recovering and showing no symptoms.  
There is nothing to be concerned about being asymptomatic. This is not airborne. The method of infection for this is through huge droplets. The transmission could be from coughing, spit, or from hand, to your face, nose, or mouth. An asymptomatic person could still transfer this if they cough, for example, if they have lung problems from smoking.  

>This cannot be tested for accurately. Many patients show false initially while sick, and later show positive.  
Since it cannot be tested accurately, this cannot be argued.

> Many Americans cannot afford the costs associated with getting labs for this test, as well as supportive care such as hospitalization, respiration, and will simply not go to the hospital until they are forced to. This already happens in America. This will advance the spread of it.  

The better way is to take preventative measure. Wash your hands, don't go near anyone that is sick, don't go near anyone that can transmit the disease, example, if someone is coughing.  

>Doctors have become ill treating patients, and a doctor has died. Doctors/nurses that have worn full respiratory suits have become ill due to improperly taking off suit.  
Doctors are in close contact with people that have been infected. We can expect transmissions due to human error."

Until now, the scientist is still trying to make the vaccine but as i said before, coronavirus is RNA based and they mutate in rapid speed. We are still trying to find the vaccine.

""In the new report, doctors describe how the man progressed from initially mild, **nonspecific symptoms to pneumonia on the ninth day of his illness**. The patient -- a 35-year-old resident of Snohomish County, Washington, with no history of major health problems -- had returned from visiting family in Wuhan on January 15. He had **not visited the seafood market** where a number of early patients were initially linked, **nor did he have any known contacts with sick people during his visit**. 

Still, the man had seen a health alert by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and decided to visit an urgent care clinic on January 19, at which point he had been **coughing for four days.**

 Sim√≥n ha dado algunos detalles del caso tras una reuni√≥n ministerial de evaluaci√≥n y seguimiento del coronavirus, que se ha celebrado en el Ministerio de Sanidad. Ahora mismo no hay ning√∫n otro caso en estudio. El paciente confirmado contrajo la enfermedad en Alemania, tras un contacto ""muy directo"" con un empleado al que se la hab√≠a transmitido una colega que ven√≠a de China. Cuando se produjo el contagio, este ten√≠a algunos s√≠ntomas (aunque todav√≠a no hab√≠a dado positivo), por lo que la hip√≥tesis de que la enfermedad se pueda transmitir por pacientes asintom√°ticos pierde cada vez m√°s peso, seg√∫n Sim√≥n.

 Los turistas alemanes que ahora est√°n en cuarentena llegaron a Espa√±a el d√≠a 28 por la noche procedentes de M√∫nich. Al d√≠a siguiente, al notificar las autoridades alemanas el positivo del caso del empleado y tener la constancia de que los que hab√≠an viajado a Espa√±a hab√≠an mantenido contacto con √©l, se decidi√≥, en principio, un aislamiento domiciliario en el municipio de Hermigua. Tras hacer las pruebas, cinco de ellos dieron negativo, pero contin√∫an en cuarentena y en observaci√≥n. El otro dio positivo, por lo que su situaci√≥n es de aislamiento en una habitaci√≥n hospitalaria, si bien, al no presentar s√≠ntomas, no requiere ning√∫n cuidado especial. Se trata de una medida de precauci√≥n.

 Las autoridades sanitarias est√°n ahora buscando posibles contactos para hacer un seguimiento, en caso de que aparezcan s√≠ntomas de la enfermedad. Dos personas a las que se les seguir√° la pista ser√°n quienes viajaban a su lado en el avi√≥n. El presidente canario, √Ångel Victor Torres, ha informado este s√°bado de que los turistas llegaron a Tenerife y, de ah√≠, fueron a La Gomera en barco, informa **Pedro Murillo**. El afectado realiz√≥ el trayecto, de una hora, al lado de una ventana, lo que ""minimiza los riesgos"". ""Hay una descripci√≥n precisa desde que sali√≥ de Alemania"", ha asegurado el jefe del servicio de Epidemiolog√≠a de Canarias, Domingo N√∫√±ez. ""En el barco no se movi√≥ ni siquiera para ir al ba√±o; no hubo contacto con otros pasajeros. No hay motivos para pensar en contactos de riesgo‚Äù. Del puerto de San Sebasti√°n de La Gomera se trasladaron en coche de alquiler a Hermigua, una peque√±a localidad que se encuentra a 20 kil√≥metros de la capital donde se ubican numerosas casas rurales.

 ### Declaraciones del ministro de Sanidad

 El ministro de Sanidad, Salvador Illa, ha manifestado su confianza en el Sistema Nacional de Salud. ""Los sistemas de detecci√≥n y alerta est√°n dando resultado. Ya hab√≠amos avisado de que era posible que se detectase alg√∫n caso en Espa√±a"", ha asegurado tras la reuni√≥n entre responsables del Gobierno.

2020-02-01,Uzziya-S,AustralianPolitics,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/AustralianPolitics/comments/ex2rkp/coronavirus_foreign_arrivals_from_mainland_china/fg7fu96/,"We are more than capable of dealing with this novel coronavirus (the fact the media hasn't named it the ""Wu Flu"" is a bit disappointing though).

Firstly, because it's not that bad despite what media reports say. The during the 2009 swine flu outbreak the fatality rate was initially reported at about 7% but that was an overestimation and the actual fatality rate is more like 0.1% - folks who aren't that sick don't go to the doctor and so they weren't counted until the initial panic died down. About the same as a bad flu season. You can see a similar thing happening with 2019-nCoV. If you just look at the day-to-day numbers and do the math yourself you'll see a fatality rate of 2-3% depending on the day which is terrifying to a lot of people. The actual fatality rate, at least according to most experts I've seen, is more like 0.1-0.2%. Again, more in line with a bad flu season.

Secondly, because the healthcare system in Australia is more than equipped to deal with this kind of thing. 2019-nCoV isn't SARS. Worst case scenario is we have a repeat of 2009's swine flu outbreak. There's a lot of media hype intentionally installing fear intentionally and a lot of overreactions from politicians feeding off that. Lying to people for money and leverage is kind of their job though. In my lab we'll start doing a rapid, high capacity screening test for 2019-nCoV starting Monday if all goes well (for those interested it's an RT-PCR test someone else already had and we scaled up). We did the assay development work for that in three days. UQ are working on a 16 week timeline before they start human trials (good luck with that). We're pretty good at responding to potential outbreaks. We were hella ready for ebola and it just kind of never came here. It's a pain in the rear for health and scientific services staff but that's part of the job. If s\*\*\* hits the fan you can expect a lot of very overworked nurses, scientists, support staff and doctors working six to seven day weeks and 10-16 hour shifts, which is a pain for us, but it's not like y'all are going to die.

Relax. This is not your problem to worry about."

Besides, currently there are 12,037 confirmed cases of coronavirus around the world with 259 deaths. Using your line of thinking, that's pretty small, right? Then again, only 284 are classified as total recovered. What about the rest of them? **They are stuck in limbo.** That's the scary thing about this virus. It sucks up your medical resources. 

Maybe you don't worry about getting sick as long as your chance or recovery is high, but most people would rather not even have that trip to the hospital. So the effect to the people on the streets is that everybody wears a mask, driving up the demand for masks (which is another story in and of itself), but what's worse, also driving the level of commerce to the ground, and this kills the economy.

A conversation this old and this deep into a reddit comment subtree is not going to be read by anybody other than the two of us. I am not making a speech to please a crowd. I am just present to you, one on one, what the fuck is going on right now.

I have moved to Hong Kong since 2011, and unfortunately I am right in the middle of this scare. I am telling you, you are what we were merely three weeks ago. I was enjoying the show until its effect on the economy hits home here in Hong Kong. And so far we only have 13 or so confirmed cases, and not even one single death yet. But the city is grinding to a halt.

Seven months of protest and the city goes to work the next morning no matter what happened the previous night. Now we all stopped. That's what this thing does."

\- 2 Days in Room temperature (??? - Previous coronaviruses ?)

I've also read that most GE dryers can do 57 degrees Celsius on a high.  So in theory you should be able to inactivate the virus that way very efficiently.

Another thing I've read is that it's vulnerable to Chlorine and solutions containing 75% Ethanol, leading some manufactures to publish lists of cleaning products containing enough chemicals to kill it.

1)  The most rigorous study so far (published in The Lancet medical journal) shows the FIRST KNOWN CASE of 2019-nCoV was NOT exposed to the Huanan Market. 

2)  The fact that China's only bsl-4 lab happens to be in the virus epicentre could be a coincidence, but... 
 
3)  The fact that the Wuhan institute of Virology was researching Novel Bat Coronavirus is a 'coincidence' that stretches credibility. 
 
4)  In 2017, international scientists expressed concern about the Wuhan lab and China's lack of expertise/transparency in handling deadly pathogens.

You are many times more likely to contact influenza (even after getting a flu shot). The death rate is not crazy high either (maybe 2-3%). Bird flu is at least 10x that.

Coronavirus *is* something we should be worried about as a society. It seems that transmission rates are high. It appears to be contagious directly from human to human during a long incubation period during which the patient may be asymptomatic. There is no vaccine available yet. If we don't take measures to stop the spread, it could lead to a significant number of deaths. If it becomes a large epidemic, then it might someday become something for individuals to be scared of.

So in short, don't worry about getting coronavirus. However, we can all take measures to prevent the total impact of the virus on our society. The best thing you can do is to stay home if you feel sick."

Right? And flights should have been shut down then. North Korea managed to be smarter about this than us. North Korea.

Again - this individual makes no difference to the argument of shutting down flights.

> Explain how so? Those two quotes are out of context. After them I said that none of the major cases are sprouting into major epidemics. This would mean that there is no reason to close down travel.

That's only the case because China did quarantine them... ever heard of using a condom while she's on the pill? Risk management.

See above.

> Those people will be quarantined and given the best care they can get. We have great health authorities who'll map out who they may have come in contact with and put them on watch. Like I said before, SARS taught us a lot about managing diseases like this, we are much more prepared.

[If you're a doctor dealing with a patient](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-nCoV/hcp/clinical-criteria.html), the mask is going to be discarded after use.  You have eye protection.  You are going to be wearing a suit that will be discarded or disinfected after use.  You are going to be wearing gloves (which can be removed to ""insta-disinfect"" your hands).  You are not going to bring the outer (contaminated) surface of the mask -- and all the stuff on the filter that you prevented from going into your lungs -- into contact with your hands without disinfecting them prior to doing things like touching food or your eyes.

As far as I can tell from photos, most people wearing them are not wearing eye protection, are probably not disinfecting their hands after touching the outside of the masks, are probably not discarding the mask after use, are probably not protecting or disinfecting or discarding their clothes (so when someone coughs on them, they're touching their clothing and then later touching the french fries that they're eating and transporting the viral material into their mouths anyway).

This new Corona virus is estimated to have a basic reproduction number (R0 or R naught) of 1.5 to 2.5 which means that the average amount of secondary cases of the disease is an average of about 1 to 3 people. Compare that to Measles which has an R0 estimation of 12-18 meaning the average number of secondary cases is an an average of 12 to 18 people. Plus measles lasts in the air for about 2 hours, so if someone with measles sneezed and left the room, people entering the room up to 2 hours afterwards can still contract measles. Coronavirus does not appear to last very long in the air or surfaces so people need to be quite close to an infected person.

Now consider the fatality rate: this new virus has an estimate 1-2% fatality rate. SARS had almost a 10% fatality rate and measles has a whopping 15% with nurological damage lasting in 25% of surviving cases.

The likelihood of a healthy person dying of this virus is very low, so we won‚Äôt see anything like the death rates of Yersinia pestis (black plague) which was so deadly the disease literately made itself go extinct. 

So coronavirus is not up to the task of being the new plague but measles is quite excited to come back in full swing as more and more dumbass white parents on facebook refuse to get their child vaccinated.

It‚Äôs hilarious how some people are freaking out of coronavirus but won‚Äôt get their kid vaccinated for a much more deadly and much much more infectious disease. I weep for humanity."

here is teh link to that what you say is cencored :  https://old.reddit.com/r/China_Flu/comments/ewuotw/discussion_biorxiv_preprint_on_2019ncov_spike/ 

and here is one of the ways it was debunked 


 > Dr. Konermann of Stanford just checked their results. The similarity is spurious. Out of 4 inserts they identify between NCov and SARS, 2 are found in bat coronavirus. Of the remaining two, only one is most similar to HIV, and is so short (6 AA) that the similarity is not higher than chance given database.
> 
> In fact, the Bat-SARS Like CoV, discovered in 2013, contains all the four insertions. Insertion 2 and 3 of 2019-nCoV are identical to Bat-SARS Like CoV. Insertion 1 involves two synonymous and one Thr-Ile mutation. Insertion 4 contains one synonymous mutation and a 12-bp insertion. Therefore, the two viruses have very high sequence similarity, and are likely evolutionarily related, naturally. Indeed, the four identified insertions are the result of the pair-wise comparison of Wuhan 2019-nCoV and 2013 SARS virus (Fig 1), and are an artifact when comparing only two viruses.
> 
> the alignment of the spike protein of the novel Coronavirus (protein ID QHD43416) with the bat spike protein mentioned by Jason Weir shows very high conservation (see attached image), particularly also in regards to the claimed ""inserts"" in Figure 2 of the preprint. This makes the bat Coronavirus a much more likely origin than the proposed connection to HIV.
> 
> I performed an alignment of these sequences and indeed found that these 4 insertions mentioned in the preprint are real. However I blasted each of these insertions to the non-redundant protein database and found over 100 hits for every single of these 4 insertions. The hits are others coronaviruses, plants, parasites, bacteria. This indicates the hits to HIV seems fortuitous and the evolutionary link between 2019-nCoV and HIV is to me not ascertained. Additionally, the authors in the manuscripts did not provide a e.value for their findings, nor they have explained in their methodology why they restricted their search for viral genomes only and not others organisms. Therefore I would argue that the results presented do not appear ""uncanny"" to me based on a flawed methodology. Therefore the results presented in this paper should be taken very cautiously.
> 
> All four of the identified amino acid insertions are extremely short and are found in the genomes of many other organisms, not just HIV. In other words, the primary finding of this work are entirely a highly expected coincidence.
> 
> In short, the authors base their analysis on a short sequence of the spike protein from 2019-nCoV, but a much more comprehensive search outside for the viral sequences queried in the manuscript demonstrates that this sequence is also found in many many other places than HIV. Thus, while the 2019-nCoV strain does appear to have a sequence difference from other closely related viruses, there is not enough resolution to clearly demonstrate the evolutionary history of this change let alone trace it to HIV.
> 
> I blasted each of the four 2019 - nCoV inserts shown in Table 1 and received 100% identity with a number of other hits other than HIV-1. For example, BLAST-P results for insert RSYLTPGDSSSG received 100% identity with Spike glycoprotein from a bat coronovirus with Genbank accession number GenBank: QHR63300.1. It is thus much closer to a known bat coronovirus than it is to HIV-1. Likewise each of the other three inserts have 100% amino acid identity to other non-HIV sources. The paper is thus highly misleading in that it does not discuss the other blast hits to non HIV-1 related sources, some of which have high identity than those from HIV-1. The implications of the paper that 2019 - nCoV coronovirus has elements of HIV-1 virus inserted into it should be treated with scepticism."

-[WHO statement](https://www.who.int/news-room/detail/30-01-2020-statement-on-the-second-meeting-of-the-international-health-regulations-%282005%29-emergency-committee-regarding-the-outbreak-of-novel-coronavirus-%282019-ncov%29)

The goal is to reduce transmission by 63% so that R is less than 1, and there's a few layers to do it.

Contact tracing and isolating individuals is the most effective and least intrusive, but it's a lot of work. It's worth having federal resources to help out a city that gets too busy, to bring their cases back down, or else their load goes past capacity and they get completely swamped. If they can track 75% of cases and reduce those transmissions by 75%, it should be enough to bring the overall rate to a crawl.

If necessary, they can try to reduce group sizes. One plan for a bad flu is to close elementary schools and keep kids in groups of 5, to reduce their number of contacts by a factor of four, which should reduce their transmission by 75%. For some reason kids play a disproportionate role spreading influenza A, and it's not clear if nCov is exactly the same, but that's the template plan for respiratory disease. As more information comes in they can target this sort of thing better.

Different cities can try different measures, and compare them to see what works. They're examining the intercity travel restrictions that China is trying, but they don't seem to be effective compared to closing schools and limiting large gatherings, which they are also doing. Eventually there will be a vaccine, and these mitigation measures are designed to slow things down until then. If they can reduce R below 1, in theory it will just go away and they don't even need a vaccine, but it's probably worth making one this time."

I think containment and eradication is highly unlikely at this point, which means this thing is either going to burn itself out, which most did pre modern medicine, or it stays alive in just enough people that it crops up seasonally.

 Either way, this seems to be one of those 'goldilocks' situations where the virus isn't fatal enough that it kills all its hosts, but it is just fatal enough that we need to screen and vaccinate for it. I don't know how China could possibly think it is going to contain and eradicate it at this point, even given the modest R0 of 2ish. The fact that it seems the majority of cases aren't causing people to go to the hospital is basically going to make this a lasting virus like H1N1 IMO. 

As a friendly reminder get your flu shots people, the flu kills 30,000 people a year and doesn't get the headlines a novel coronavirus does. Apathy is a hell of a drug."
