Opening up the country will have disastrous effects, to both human life and the economy. What will happen is that some (idiots) will go about life as usual, some will be forced to work, but many many people will continue to stay home or keep their businesses temporarily closed. 

What will this do? It will cause BOTH the economy to fail and people to die as COVID-19 spreads rapidly through the population inundating hospitals indirectly killing thousands of those with AND without COVID-19 (think of those that need surgeries / medical attention and cant get it due to an overwhelmed medical system), AND it will cause the economy to fail as millions continue to stay home as their fear of cocid-19 INCREASES as the result of knowing that others are free to carry it about the populous while at the same time businesses will stay closed to ensure the safety of their workers (and if they open they will open to a severely depressed demand base). 

This will end in a long, protracted recession/depression on top of a massive loss of life. And if you think China/Russia were aggressive towards the U.S. before wait until they see us at our weakest as our country impales itself with a foolish decision of reopening the country as COVID-19 skyrockets."

[Here's a calculator you can use to estimate number of people infected in your state/country. This model conservatively estimates for 53,000 US confirmed cases on Mar 24 there are 13.4 million infected.

The estimator inputs are sourced and rationale for estimated figures are explained in detail on that page.

If you disagree with the estimates, you can edit ALL the inputs and come up with your own value. There's a button to share a link to your estimate. Include it below and we can see how realistic your assumptions are.

> In Italy, 9.5 percent of the people who have tested positive for the virus have succumbed to covid-19, according to data compiled at Johns Hopkins University. In France, the rate is 4.3 percent. But in Germany, it’s 0.4 percent.

> The biggest reason for the difference, infectious disease experts say, is Germany’s work in the early days of its outbreak to track, test and contain infection clusters. That means Germany has a truer picture of the size of its outbreak than places that test only the obviously symptomatic, most seriously ill or highest-risk patients.

> Merkel says coronavirus presents gravest crisis since WWII

> “At the beginning, when we had relatively few cases, when it came to finding them and isolating them, we did quite well in Germany,” said Reinhard Busse, head of the department of health care management at the Berlin University of Technology. “That’s the major reason.”

> Other factors, such as the age of those infected and the timing of Germany’s outbreak, also play a role in the differing death rates. But testing widely has been key. Germany, with 31,150 cases at midday Tuesday, appeared to have a larger outbreak than France, with 20,149. But the higher death rate in France implies there were more undiagnosed cases there. France’s outbreak could be larger than Germany’s.

> Germany has not carried out mass testing of the kind employed in countries such as South Korea. But initially, at least, the country’s health authorities tracked infection clusters meticulously. When an individual tested positive, they used contact tracing to find other people with whom they had been in touch and then tested and quarantined them, which broke infection chains.

>Christian Drosten, a virologist at the Charité hospital in Berlin, said he’s “firmly convinced” that Germany’s high diagnostic capacity had “secured us an extreme lead . . . in the detection of the epidemic.”

> But he cautioned against complacency, and said the death rate would increase: “We are no exception.”

> Epidemiologists say it’s important to look at Germany’s outbreak in two distinct phases. As community spread became prevalent, infection chains in some cases became impossible to trace. Some doctors said they had no choice but to send people seeking tests back home to call jammed coronavirus hotlines because they lacked protective equipment to conduct them safely.

> With cases growing exponentially, health authorities have moved on to ordering social distancing and banning mass events. Federal states have restricted gatherings outside the home to a maximum of two people.

> South Korea, which has been praised as a model for responding to the outbreak, has a death rate of 1.2 percent. Busse credits Germany’s lower rate to timing.

> “In South Korea, there’s been a longer duration of infections, so we can’t really compare,” he said. “We have lots of newly positive cases. They didn’t have the chance to die yet.”

> Busse said Germany is more comparable to Norway. The Scandinavian country is at a similar point in its outbreak, it’s also worked to test and contain cases, and it also has a death rate of 0.4 percent.

> Whether Germany’s distancing measures will “flatten the curve” is not yet clear. Lothar Wieler, president of the federal agency responsible for disease control, was hopeful Monday that a period of exponential growth might be slowing, but cautioned that it was too early to say, given fluctuations in data. He said the picture should be clearer by Wednesday.

> Germany’s initial testing criteria were no wider than Italy’s. People were tested if they had symptoms and had been to a risk area, or if they had contact with a confirmed case. But many initial cases had clear links to overseas travel.

> The guidelines have since been expanded and testing has been boosted in recent weeks. The number tested jumped from 35,000 in the first week of March to 100,000 in the second, according to Germany’s medical association. The estimates don’t include tests conducted inside hospitals.

> Epidemiologist Karl Lauterbach, a member of the German parliament, noted that the German outbreak started with large numbers of young people — “people who came back from holidays.”

> The young have fared better with the coronavirus than the elderly. Italy’s initial outbreak struck at the heart of an aging population. Lauterbach said he expected Germany’s death rate to rise as more vulnerable segments of society are infected.

> Because testing is not universal, and many people with the coronavirus might never be diagnosed, a true death rate is impossible to ascertain. But experts say the rate is likely to be significantly higher in countries such as Spain and Italy, where care is collapsing.

> With more intensive care beds and ventilators than most other European nations and early measures to prevent the spread of the virus, Lauterbach said, he didn’t see Germany turning into Italy or Spain. Still, he has been advocating for wider restrictions.

> “I think with all things considered, Germany will do reasonably well in this first round of a long fight,” he said."

It will crash due to controlled shutdown, or it will crash once bodies start piling up and people stay at home out of fear.

The second crash won't happen as fast but will take much longer both to happen and recovery.

Reality has arrived and it won't be denied this time. Part of me thinks this was an intentional calculation by China.

Extreme short term pain and sacrifice to ensure the long term success of China.

It is a new strain when there is a major phenotypic change that makes it functionally different from other versions of the virus.

A virus is constantly mutating. Hell, *you* are constantly mutating as well. Anything with DNA or RNA is constantly mutating. If the mutation is small and does not lead to a major change in the surface proteins of the virus, it's just a mutation. If the mutation leads to huge changes (e.g. something that makes a vaccine ineffective), it's a new strain.

New strains can come about from random mutations, but often it's from a single cell being infected by two viruses. The DNA/RNA of each gets all mixed up and packaged randomly. If some of those mutations are viable, you get a new strain."

>Good evening.

>Since when we rescued our brothers in Wuhan, China, in an operation coordinated by the ministries of defense and foreign affairs, the yellow light has come to us. We started to prepare to face the coronavirus, because we knew that sooner or later it would arrive in Brazil.

>Our health minister met with almost all health secretaries in the states so that the strategic plan for fighting the virus could be built.

>And ever since, Dr. Henrique Mandetta has been doing an excellent job of clarifying and preparing SUS for the care of possible victims.

>But what we had to contain at that moment was panic, hysteria and, at the same time, devise a strategy to save lives and avoid mass unemployment. We did so, against everything and against everyone.

>Much of the media went against the grain. They spread the feeling of dread exactly, with the announcement of the large number of victims in Italy as their flagship. A country with a large number of elderly people and with a climate totally different from ours. The perfect scenario, enhanced by the media, for a real hysteria to spread throughout our country.

>It can be seen that, from yesterday to today, part of the press has changed its editorial, asking for calm and tranquility. That's really good. Congratulations, Brazilian press. It is essential that common sense and balance prevail among us.

>The virus has arrived, is being faced by us and will soon pass. Our life has to go on. Jobs must be maintained. The livelihood of families must be preserved. We must return to normality.

>A few state and local authorities must abandon the concept of scorched earth, the ban on transportation, the closing of businesses and mass confinement.

>What is happening in the world has shown that the risk group is that of people over 60 years old. Why close schools? Fatal cases of healthy people under the age of 40 are rare. 90% of us will have no manifestation if we get infected.

>What we should do is be extremely concerned about not transmitting the virus to others, especially to our dear parents and grandparents, respecting the guidelines of the Ministry of Health.

>In my particular case, due to my athlete's history, if I was infected with the virus, I wouldn't have to worry. Nothing would feel or would, at most, have a cold or a cold, as that famous doctor from that famous television said.

>While I am speaking, the world is seeking treatment for the disease. The American FDA and Albert Einstein hospital, in São Paulo, are seeking proof of the effectiveness of chloroquine in the treatment of Covid-19. Our government has received positive news about this medicine manufactured in Brazil and widely used to fight malaria, lupus and arthritis.

>I believe in God, who will train scientists and researchers from Brazil and the world to cure this disease. I take this opportunity to pay tribute to all health professionals: doctors, technical nurses and collaborators who receive us at the front lines in hospitals, treat us and comfort us.

>Without panic or hysteria, as I have been talking about since the beginning, we will overcome the virus and be proud to live in this new Brazil that, yes, has everything to be a great nation. We are together, increasingly united.

>God bless our dear homeland."
