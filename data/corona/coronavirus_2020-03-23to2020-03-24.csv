The Milford High School graduate who gained notoriety last week for indulging in spring-break partying during a pandemic despite warnings against large gatherings has apologized. 

Brady Sluder said he has realized he's not invincible after all. 

""I wasn't aware of the severity of my actions and comments,"" Sluder posted in an apology on his Instagram account March 22. ""I'd like to take this time to own up to the mistakes I've made and apologize to the people I've offended.""

Sluder drew attention for a TV interview from Miami, Florida, in which he downplayed the seriousness of the new coronavirus pandemic.

The clip has been used to highlight crowds of spring break partiers defying stay-at-home suggestions – which have since turned into stay-at-home orders for several states. The video aired on various national media outlets, including in a story Thursday, March 19, on NBC’s Today Show. His quote also has appeared in USA TODAY and the Washington Post.

Sluder said in his apology that he was feeling ""invincible"" like many others his age. The disease appears deadliest to the elderly and people with underlying medical conditions, which has led some young adults to falsely assume they can't get seriously ill from it. 

""Our generation may feel invincible, like I did when I commented, but we have a responsibility to listen and follow the recommendations in our communities,"" Sluder wrote. ""I will continue to reflect and learn from this and continue to play for our well-being. I deeply apologize from the bottom of my heart for my insensitivity and unawareness of my actions.”

He said he doesn't want to endanger the elderly and otherwise at-risk people in his life. 

In the caption for his post, he added: “I’m not asking for your forgiveness or pity. I want to use this as motivation to become a better person, a better son, a better friend, and a better citizen…Don’t be arrogant and think you’re invincible like myself.”"

""We take these complaints very seriously and would like to thank all of those who reported the video so the issue could be addressed.""

WHO is not only complicit in China's efforts to downplay the seriousness of this virus and to cover up its origins, they worked hand in hand with China to ensure the rest of the world was caught by surprise as infected travelers from China ([5 million from Wuhan city alone](https://www.scmp.com/news/china/society/article/3047720/chinese-premier-li-keqiang-head-coronavirus-crisis-team-outbreak)) spread the virus throughout China and then around the world.

On top of that WHO does China's dirty work in isolating Taiwan from the global medical community leaving 23.8 million people at risk.

We're all going to learn a lot of lessons from this crisis, and of course world leaders in places that were hit hard should be criticized for their mishandling of the response, but one thing that will not be forgotten is WHO's complicity and involvement in this virus' rapid spread. WHO already had an unflattering reputation coming out of the SARS response, I expect that this time the reaction from world leaders once this is all said and done will have some more serious ramifications on WHO's future viability and the effectiveness of the UN as a whole."

Now, if we still have these wonder suits in our hospitals, they are not being brought out.

There's the group who believe some mix of the following: 

- we're on the verge of mooning
- everything is priced in
- coronavirus is overblown
- we'll be back to normal in 8 days - at the end of Trump's 15 plan. or mid-April at the latest
- We're already past peak panic
- the world about to wake up, en masse, to the genius of Satoshi and will be throwing every dollar they have into bitcoin

And the other group believing the polar opposite:

- bitcoin (and all risk-on assets) are going to be under continued pressure, re-visiting lows or making new lows
- Hardly anything is priced in bcs how can anything be priced in when we're in the middle of so many unknowns?  
- coronavirus is a very real threat - to health and economies
- Normal? This _is_ the new normal. Lockdown til May (or later) and then gradual return to public life with a few billion gallons of hand sanitizer and everyone staying six feet apart for at least 12-18mos.
- Peak panic? We probably haven't seen anything yet... 
- Bitcoin is squarely risk-on and as the world deteriorates and second order impacts pile on, panic will increase. 

I don't think I've ever seen such a stark contrast in here since the the buttcoiner days. This sub was flooded with nocoiners, claiming that bitcoin was trash and would soon be dead. And now this... 

Nice thing about a trading sub is that we can all place bets based on our beliefs. Buttcoiners got crushed.

>Lesson 1: Intervene Fast, Before It’s a Crisis
Just one week after the country’s first case was diagnosed in late January, government officials met with representatives from several medical companies. They urged the companies to begin immediately developing coronavirus test kits for mass production, promising emergency approval.

> Within two weeks, though South Korea’s confirmed cases remained in the double digits, thousands of test kits were shipping daily. The country now produces 100,000 kits per day, and officials say they are in talks with 17 foreign governments about exporting them.

...

> Lesson 2: Test Early, Often and Safely
South Korea has tested far more people for the coronavirus than any other country, enabling it to isolate and treat many people soon after they are infected.

> The country has conducted over 300,000 tests, for a per-capita rate more than 40 times that of the United States.

> “Testing is central because that leads to early detection, it minimizes further spread and it quickly treats those found with the virus,” Kang Kyung-wha, South Korea’s foreign minister, told the BBC, calling the tests “the key behind our very low fatality rate as well.”

>Though South Korea is sometimes portrayed as having averted an epidemic, thousands of people were infected and the government was initially accused of complacency. Its approach to testing was designed to turn back an outbreak already underway.

>To spare hospitals and clinics from being overwhelmed, officials opened 600 testing centers designed to screen as many people as possible, as quickly as possible — and keep health workers safe by minimizing contact.

>At 50 drive-through stations, patients are tested without leaving their cars. They are given a questionnaire, a remote temperature scan and a throat swab. The process takes about 10 minutes. Test results are usually back within hours.

...

> 
Lesson 3: Contact Tracing, Isolation and Surveillance
When someone tests positive, health workers retrace the patient’s recent movements to find, test — and, if necessary, isolate — anyone the person may have had contact with, a process known as contact tracing.

>This allows health workers to identify networks of possible transmission early, carving the virus out of society like a surgeon removing a cancer.

>South Korea developed tools and practices for aggressive contact tracing during the MERS outbreak. Health officials would retrace patients’ movements using security camera footage, credit card records, even GPS data from their cars and cellphones.

>“We did our epidemiological investigations like police detectives,” Dr. Ki said. “Later, we had laws revised to prioritize social security over individual privacy at times of infectious disease crises.”

>As the coronavirus outbreak grew too big to track patients so intensively, officials relied more on mass messaging.

>South Koreans’ cellphones vibrate with emergency alerts whenever new cases are discovered in their districts. Websites and smartphone apps detail hour-by-hour, sometimes minute-by-minute, timelines of infected people’s travel — which buses they took, when and where they got on and off, even whether they were wearing masks.

>People who believe they may have crossed paths with a patient are urged to report to testing centers.

Why this Nobel laureate predicts a quicker coronavirus recovery: 'We're going to be fine'

""Michael Levitt, a Nobel laureate and Stanford biophysicist, began analyzing the number of COVID-19 cases worldwide in January and correctly calculated that China would get through the worst of its coronavirus outbreak long before many health experts had predicted.

Now he foresees a similar outcome in the United States and the rest of the world.

While many epidemiologists are warning of months, or even years, of massive social disruption and millions of deaths, Levitt says the data simply don't support such a dire scenario — especially in areas where reasonable social distancing measures are in place."""

A lot of people have equated this resurgence in what they assume is nature to be due to the lack of human pollution, now that we are all quarantined and confined to the relative safety of our homes. I've seen more than a handful of posts taking about how in the absence of humanity, life flourishes as it should, and this is used to hand-wringe about how humans bad. 

It also comes with a curious serving of what some might call ecofacism. Oh, well people are gonna die, but let's not focus on that, let's shed light on how poorly we treat the earth!!1. This idea might have good intentions, to distract from the glaring microscope the world has placed on current events (for good reason), and in a naive attempt at optimism in light of this situation. But it brings a far more ignorant tone with the words.

We know the impact that humanity (more specifically, capitalism) has had on the Earth. We've existed on this planet for thousands of years, but the deterioration of the Earth's natural resources has accelerated exponentially in the past centuries. We knew this before a virus pandemic threatened a large subset of our population, targeting those in our world who are vulnerable. We don't need to detract from the suffering that this event will bring to millions of people, to go on and say ""but thank god coronavirus helped spread awareness!!""

The sheer thought of that statement is apalling, insensitive and cruel. Shame on trendmood for sitting in her expensive house with her financially secure family, and having the gall to thank the very pandemic that has already taken the lives of thousands of people, and is on track to take more. That is called entitlement.

(PS: The river canals in Italy are clear because the dust and sediment aren't being kicked up by boats, after weeks of inactivity. Fish have always been there. Humanity in itself hasn't burned this world to a crisp, Capitalism has. That being said, we all can play a role in being mindful of our impact on this world, and take steps to improve our own environmental impact, while also not being fucking insensitive.)"

>In order to counter the coronavirus pandemic, researchers hope to use drugs. In this context, the names chloroquine and remdesivir appear again and again.

>**In the existing drugs, the active ingredient chloroquine is currently being traded as a possible weapon against Sars-Cov-2 - is it really a promising candidate?**

>Chloroquine is a very old remedy for malaria. However, its antiviral effects have only recently become known. There is also a study from Marseille in France, which, especially with regard to Covid-19, initially seemed quite positive. However, there is one major criticism of this study. Because what was found as a result is not really relevant. It was only examined whether many or few viruses remained after the treatment, but not what really helped the patient and how he felt afterwards. That is of course the crucial question. So I'm very careful about that. I don't think chloroquine will be a big hit in the treatment of Covid-19.

>**Which drugs do you have more hope for?**

>I think it is more likely that above all antiviral substances will be successful. The drug Remdesivir is at the forefront. It is a substance that was developed during the Ebola crisis in 2014. Remdesivir works by inserting a disguised gene building block into the virus' gene sequence. The virus then uses this wrong building block when copying its gene sequence. However, this causes the virus to stop growing in the cell.

**From a different source:**

>[Remdesivir] is now considered one of the most promising drugs in the fight against serious corona diseases. Doctors in German hospitals are also currently pinning their hopes on Remdesivir. Three German clinics involved The Federal Institute for Drugs and Medical Devices (BfArM) has now confirmed to the NDR and WDR that it has approved two studies with Remdesivir in which the drug is also to be tested against Covid-19 in Germany. A randomized controlled trial will involve 400 seriously ill Covid-19 patients who will be given the drug for 14 days. The other study will test the drug in 600 patients with mild Covid-19 symptoms.

New restrictions to combat the coronavirus epidemic have been announced tonight by French Prime Minister Edouard Philippe during a televised address. The key points are:

- Physical activity or going out with children is limited to one hour within a radius of 1km from your home, once a day and not with others.

- The obligatory form needed to go out is changing to also include a time on it. For reminder this form (or a signed handwritten note with the same wording) is needed per person for every outing from your home. There is a separate form to use if your reason for leaving home is professional. If you are out with your children they must be listed on your form.

- Open-air markets will be closed with a few exemptions, notable if the market is a primary source of food supply for an area.


- Travel for health reasons is now only authorised if a medical professional has ordered it or for urgent reasons. Going to the pharmacy for medicines is covered under the purchase of essential goods.

- Funerals limited to a maximum of 20 people.

The changes will begin from tomorrow Tuesday March 24.

The Minister of Health earlier tonight announced that the number of people who have now died of the virus in France since the beginning of the epidemic has risen to 860, including 186 in the last 24 hours. The number of confirmed cases is now 19,856 – 3,176 more in the last day.

Health Minister Olivier Véran said 8,675 people are hospitalised because of Covid-19, 1,435 more in the last day. Among them, 2,082 are in intensive care, 335 more than yesterday.

Four doctors, all aged 60 or above, in eastern France were also reported to have died from the virus today, bringing to five the number of medical personnel who have died from Covid-19 in France."

I started feeling sick on Friday, self-quarantined as much as I could (have 4 kids and a wife here as well). My symptoms are low-grade fever, coughing (sometimes dry, sometimes wet), fatigue and heaviness in the chest... a little shortness of breath when I exert myself (decided to clean the bathroom I use and get some boxes down from the closet).

Still, mostly fine, but I do find myself getting “sicker” the more I read about the virus... the shortness of breath feels much more prevalent, even when resting... then headaches, racing pulse, etc.

I don’t even know for sure if I have a cold, flu or if it’s Covid, but I do know when I consume hours of articles and anecdotes about the virus my symptoms seem to spiral downwards, likely due to anxiety. 

I started limiting my consumption of updates to stay informed but not to obsess... and instead focused more on movies and video games (after all, wtf is there to be done anyway beyond what I’m already doing?) and I still feel sick, but no longer feel like I should maybe go to the ER (knock on wood).

My wife knows my symptoms and we’re absolutely prepared for me to go if things got worse. But, I’d much rather ride this out at home than stress myself into a hospital visit... especially being that there’s people out there who might need that bed."

All this stuff about Michonne searching for Rick, the CRM group, helicopters, etc., just feels like Gimple’s way of sending the audience on a wild goose chase. We’ve been getting hints about a larger world since season 7, with the introduction of the Scavengers. Now season 10 is close to wrapping up, yet we *still* know nothing about the whereabouts of Rick, or what the CRM group even is.

Gimple acts like all these little clues are building towards some intricately laid out plan, but all he’s doing is just teasing this expanded universe, while never actually telling us anything new. I find this incredibly frustrating. Gimple wants to build an interconnected universe like the MCU, but for the past 4 years, he’s done nothing but tease a larger world, all while never actually showing us anything. He wants to give the illusion that there’s a larger story at play, but he isn’t actually ready to do anything with this expanded universe.

And what a way to finally start world building, waiting nearly a decade into the franchise, and *well* past the height of its popularity, to do so. It’s like if the MCU only focused on Tony Stark, and didn’t have any crossovers until 20 movies into the franchise. Talk about striking while the iron is lukewarm. All of this world building should have happened a long time ago, with none of the endless teases that lead us nowhere. The longer this CRM storyline is dragged out, the less interested I’m becoming.

Also, it’s never just the 2 of them taking care of the kids there’s usually their nanny, housekeeper or family helping so I wonder if their nanny or housekeeper are still working? Idk if she mentioned it but I’m struggling to believe she and Brandon would actually watch their kids, cook & clean their house for this long 😂.

blamin' the you-know-who, "" ""Yeah, but he'd have won though.""  
Yeah, I probably got a couple of screws up in my head loose  
But no worse than what's goin' on in my Delaware living room  
Sometimes I wanna not debate and just let loose  
But can't, but N.B.D with Trump on Access Hollywood  
""Listen fat, you're full of shit, listen fat you're full of shit""  
And if I'm lucky, this might just give me a little win  
And that's the message that we deliver to voting swings  
And expect them not to care what a woman's right to choose is

By the time they hit spring break 

They watch the Fox News channel, don't they?  
We ain't nothin' but 'mericans—well, some of us, Democrats

I just get on the ballot and win it  
And whether you like to admit it, I just shit it  
Better than 90% of you commies out can  
Then you wonder: ""How can  
Low Infos eat up these platitudes like Valiums?""  
It's funny, 'cause at the rate I'm going, when I'm 80  
I'll be the only person in the Cabinet flirting  
Rubbing VP's elbows when I'm sniffin' hair with centrists  
And I'm working, but this whole bunch of far leftists isn't learning  
And every single person is a Biden voter lurking  
He could be working at Burger King, messin' up your onion rings  
Or in the parking lot, circling, screaming, ""You're a lying fat fuck!""  
With his windows down and his radio up

So will the real Joe Biden please stand up  
And put down ballot candidates on swing states up?  
And be proud to be twenty points up and having a ball

It's so deadly and severe is because humans do not have any immunity to it yet. Influenza is one hell of a virus, it wreaks havoc on our bodies, attacks where ever it can and is very contagious as well as easily spread. Unlike Ebola or Aids it does not require blood to infect new hosts, or skin contact even. This virus lingers in the air, chills on surfaces, it does not even require a host person to have symptoms for it to spread. Influenza is literally one of the scariest viruses around. The only reason common colds and flus do not cause this much damage usually is because we have developed a certain degree of immunity to current strains.

Edit - and in time the COVID19 will follow suit, it will just be a little bit of a bug and people will once more forget how serious cold and flus can be. This is just a bit of history repeating. Its incredibly sad and i think this mentality of saying its 'just a flu' although true undermines the seriousness of what we are dealing with right now. Some people are really not as scared or prepared as they should be, and behave in incredibly stupid and selfish ways.

*Please be aware all the COVID legislation passed on 23 March (and a few are still going through), and it takes time for that information to be known by officers, so don’t expect all the answers this week.*

Centrelink services are going to be very very stretched over the coming months. You can make it easier on everyone if you sort out your paperwork early and adopt a common sense approach to interacting with public services to lessen the load. 

Try online first. If the online system is down, have a look at the website to prepare:  [COVID-19 info](https://www.servicesaustralia.gov.au/individuals/subjects/affected-coronavirus-covid-19) 

*Policy* (and legislative drafting) re social security and family assistance is *not* made in Centrelink but in the Dept of Social Services. Read all about the details here: [Coronavirus (COVID-19) information and support](https://www.dss.gov.au/about-the-department/coronavirus-covid-19-information-and-support)

**Useful Info For Claims**

* [Newstart claim](https://www.servicesaustralia.gov.au/sites/default/files/2018/09/ci003-1809en.pdf)

- go through each question and the checklist at the end carefully

- Get all your paperwork in order and scan or photograph your documents to produce decent quality uploads to make it easier for the staff to process your claim. 

BTW, a blurry photo that’s mostly dark grey or a photo that’s huge or tiny is kind is a shitty thing to upload. So please try and read your photos before you upload them. If at all possible turning your uploads into PDFs makes things easier on everyone. Similarly, changing the file names for your uploads to describe contents (Surname-ID-Date) will help. 

Some of the information you would *normally* (see below) need would include:

* ID, including showing residence details (eg passport with visa, if you have it) 

* recent employment information, if you are applying because of recent income loss, perhaps try and get something from your employer in writing about lack of work etc (if this is easy enough to get I would do it, for no other reason as it will give you evidence for your future CV. If you’re still working, recent payslips, if you’re not working, employment separation certificates

* evidence of every source of income, such as recent payslips, or if self employed your last tax return, you might need to do an estimated profit and loss statement if you don’t have a tax return.

* statements and bank balances for all of your bank accounts, 

* info about any shares you own (remember those Telstra &amp;amp;amp;amp; IAG shares. (You will need the ASX code and number of shares you hold)

* if you pay rent, a rent certificate it recent lease 

* if you have a partner you also have to provide details for them, incl ID and all income and asset info.


**NB: a lot of verification requirements are going to be  waived during the crisis, so don’t despair if you can’t get certain documents.**

**Why claims processing can take weeks:**

Skipping information or not providing everything you need wastes so much time. It will delay your claim and drive you and the Centrelink staff (who will be inundated) mad. The easier you can make it to approve the claim, the quicker it can be processed. If you’re not uploading something because it’s a bit hard to find something, it means that someone will have to send a letter or make a call while there’s another 100 claims are waiting. That takes time and may not happen days after the person decided they could get no further with your claim.  Then, when you provide the information your claim will not be able to be picked up immediately - because there’s another 100 who also had to bring more stuff. So, suck it up and get your shit together. Time to adult.

**How to help reduce call wait times**

* if at all possible check online info before you call. 

* have ID, paper and pen ready to take notes.

* Don’t start calls with complaints about Centrelink/wait times/government/personal history of shitty things you had to go through to get help. (If 50,000 people reduce their calls by cutting out 30s of chitchat that’s 400 h of talk time or 50 extra staff working an 8 hr day answering calls). 

* Be ready with CRN (if you have one), name, DOB, address and other ID.

* explain clearly why you are calling (Am I eligible for... , I want to claim ... I want to check my rate ... I want a review of my decision).

* listen carefully and repeat back what you think you‘re being told so officers can assess whether they have understood you and you have understood them.

* if you receive more than one payment ask whether info applies to all the payments you receive. 

* if you are calling for another relative or friend, (and they have not completed a nominee form, or are not a partner who has specifically authorised Centrelink to talk to you), they must be sitting next to you, be able to identify themselves and be able to give permission for an officer to talk to you.

* Above all, be mindful that Centrelink staff deal with distressed people in crisis all day. If you’re angry it kicks in people’s defense mechanisms,  making miscommunication much more likely.*

The Army has located elderly dead in their beds in residences in various parts of the country, according to [Cadena SER](https://cadenaser.com/ser/2020/03/23/tribunales/1584976473_901854.html?ssm=whatsapp)  and sources at the Ministry of Defense confirm to eldiario.es. The Emergency Military Unit (UME) is carrying out relief work in these centers in the last days in the face of the situation caused by the coronavirus crisis.

The military come as a preventive measure and also to assess the situation of patients and advise staff on disinfection and prevention. Nursing homes have become one of the establishments hardest hit by the health emergency caused by the coronavirus epidemic. 

Defense Minister Margarita Robles warned this Monday in an interview on Telecinco that they will be ""absolutely unforgiving and forceful"" with these actions. ""It is a very powerful message to keep in mind,"" he said.

The State Attorney General's Office announced last week that it had established throughout its territorial structure a network aimed at ""gathering information, issuing guidelines and acting effectively and homogeneously"" in events that affect nursing homes. ""The care and monitoring of these residences is part of the activity of the Public Prosecutor, empowered at the moment to give a better response to the incidence of the epidemic within the scope of the Prosecutor's Office,"" the institution explained in a note sent to the media.

The Madrid Prosecutor's Office opened proceedings to investigate the death of 17 elderly people in the Monte Hermoso nursing home in Madrid at the request of a complaint from the association 'El Defensor del Paciente'. The investigations began after this association asked the Community of Madrid's superior prosecutor, Jesús Caballero Klink, to investigate this event after the complaint of several of the relatives."

""To our loyal and passionate members around the world, thank you for your continued support and dedication to the PDGA during these very difficult and uncertain times. The world is experiencing an unprecedented health crisis that impacts the lives of each and every individual. While it seems small by comparison, our global disc golf community has also been significantly affected by this pandemic.   


Our Board of Directors and PDGA Staff have been working diligently to stay ahead of daily developments related to the coronavirus pandemic, specifically how it impacts the safety and wellbeing of our members, staff, volunteers, and our communities. We made some very difficult decisions in the past few weeks, including the suspension of all PDGA sanctioning as well as the cancellation of several high-profile events. We want you to know that these decisions were not taken lightly. We know how important the competition and the camaraderie of disc golf are, and that suspending PDGA-sanctioned play – an outlet for many during stressful times – has caused disruption. We deeply appreciate the understanding, flexibility, and support of our members and tournament directors in the face of this global health crisis.   


While we know you want to be out playing right now, we need your help to set a good example for communities everywhere. That is why we are asking disc golfers to skip the course and stay home. It is something we all have the power to do in this crisis, and while it may seem like a tall task, we are confident it is the best choice to help slow the spread of the coronavirus. This goes for the young and healthy, as well as those considered more vulnerable.  We are all in this together.  


The PDGA Staff has transitioned to working remotely throughout the duration of the crisis and will continue to operate with very little disruption as we await a return to normalcy. As always, we remain committed to the promotion, growth and sustainability of the sport, and are placing increased emphasis on keeping the health and safety of our communities as our foremost concern. Please follow the guidance of government health agencies and local authorities, and continue to check in at PDGA.com and on our social media channels to keep up to date with the latest news and information, including any additional postponements or cancellations that may be necessary as the situation continues to unfold.   


I know that disc golf will emerge from this better and stronger than ever. It won’t be long before the sound of rattling chains will once again fill the air at a course near you. On behalf of the PDGA Staff and Board of Directors, we thank you for your patience and cooperation.  


Sincerely,  


Justin Menickelli, Ph.D.  
PDGA Board of Directors President"""

Don't forget this started with just a handful of cases and increased exponentially.  Even once it calms down, it can flare up again very easily.

That's one of the reasons that it's not an entirely sensible idea - the point of lockdown is to buy time for the health services.  You don't cure anything for 12-18 months from now.  Herd immunity is a long-term goal, not a temporary occurence.

The second you lift the lockdown, things progress just as they always have so long as there are even a handful of cases in the country (and a large family can easily spread coronavirus among themselves for months given the right conditions).  There are even a bunch of asymptomatic carriers... which if proven true could be devastating to any kind of isolation working as an eradication.

The more or less you go out, the longer the lockdown lasts than you thought.  We could like this all year, quite easily... maybe in bursts or ebbs and flows, but the disease isn't going away and started with only a handful of people on the other side of the world."

In this two-part episode, our contributing editor W. Wayt Gibbs in Washington state—a state hit early and hard by COVID-19—reports on scientists’ fast-evolving understanding of this new coronavirus and the probable trajectory of this pandemic.

Today, in part one, he focuses on why the new coronavirus is spreading so quickly and is so difficult to control.

Check back in tomorrow for part two, when Gibbs looks at computer models that are predicting how long we’ll need to shut down large parts of society to prevent hospitals from being overwhelmed. He also looks at how emerging tests for immunity to the virus could pose thorny ethical issues in the months to come.

Wayt recorded this episode on March 22nd. The first voice you hear: Governor Jay Inslee of Washington.

JI: “It is not rhetorical or hyperbolic when I say that everyone needs to change their behavior, change the way that we live—temporarily—if we are going to prevent significant loss of life for the people we love in the state of Washington. And when I say everyone, I mean, frankly, everyone. Because we all are potential transmitters of this virus, and we all, to some varying degree, are potential victims of this virus.”

WWG: That was Governor Jay Inslee, pleading with people in my state on March 20th to stay home and stay away from each other. All around the U.S.—and around the world—governors and mayors and prime ministers are urging, begging, in many places even ordering their citizens to shelter in place.

But it’s not easy to resist our hard-wired desires to spend time with our friends, to visit our parents and grandparents, to go to work.

So here in Washington, like in lots of other places, compliance has been—kind of spotty. Traffic on some of the major highways here—a good proxy for human intermingling—is down only about 20% or so from normal.

But as scientists learn more about the SARS-CoV-2 virus and the COVID-19 pandemic, it’s becoming apparent that we’re facing a much more serious situation than most of us thought even a couple weeks ago.

Let me give you one example from here in Washington. On March 10th, despite stern official warnings not to gather in groups, 56 people met for an event in Skagit County. All of them were apparently healthy at the time. But ten days later, 43 of those 56 people have either been confirmed to have COVID-19 or are showing symptoms of the disease. Experts suspect that one or more people in the group was a so-called “super-shedder,” someone who has yet to show symptoms but is transmitting lots of infectious virus.

In this two-part episode, we’ll look at several new research studies and new tests announced this week that may help answer four crucial questions.

Question 1: Can you catch this disease from someone who isn’t in the same room as you?

Question 2: Can you catch it from somebody who isn’t sick—and is there a way to test for that?

Question 3: What combination of shutdowns and closures will do the most to minimize the number of people who die from the pandemic? And how long will those tough restrictions need to continue?

And question 4: How will each of us know when we’re immune and no longer need to worry about catching COVID-19 or giving it to someone else? And what will we do with that information once we have it?"

>The celebration was to be held at Moraga Vineyards, the sprawling estate in Bel Air, Calif., where the elder Murdoch has been spending most of his time with his wife, the model and actress Jerry Hall. Mr. Murdoch bought the property for $28.8 million in 2013.

>The person who told me about the canceled party did so to highlight the disconnect between the family’s prudent private conduct and the reckless words spoken on air at their media company.

>The canceled party is perhaps the most glaring instance of the gap I wrote about this week between the elite, globally minded family owners of Fox — who took the crisis seriously as reports emerged in January in their native Australia — and many of their nominal stars, who treated the virus as a political assault on Mr. Trump, before zigzagging, along with the president, toward a focus on the enormity of the public health risk.

>Mr. Murdoch is in good shape for an 89-year-old, people around him say. But he took a bad fall on a yacht in January 2018, an incident that rocked his empire, and he no longer regularly takes control of his newsrooms as he did a few years ago.

>His successor at Fox — which includes Fox News, Fox Business, the broadcast network and sports businesses — is his 48-year-old son, Lachlan, whom associates describe as unready for the challenge of steering a complex company and its powerful hosts through a public health crisis. The younger Murdoch has played little role in the recent coverage, people with knowledge of the company said.

>Rupert Murdoch has claimed privately in recent days that he contacted the most powerful of the Fox News hosts, Sean Hannity, to urge him to take the crisis seriously, but Mr. Hannity denied to me that he had heard from Mr. Murdoch on the topic.

>A spokesman for the Murdochs did not respond to an inquiry about the party cancellation.

>The celebration would have taken place on the night that reality finally set in for many people. On March 11, Tom Hanks and his wife were diagnosed with the coronavirus, the National Basketball Association canceled its season and Mr. Trump delivered a sobering address. 

>Instead of an event for 20 guests, the elder Murdoch and Ms. Hall, the person close to the family said, hosted a small dinner attended only by close family members."

>
>Patrick, who turns 70 next week, made the case for restarting the country’s businesses, telling Carlson, “I’m not living in fear of covid-19. What I’m living in fear of is what’s happening to this country.”
>
>“And you know, Tucker, no one reached out to me and said, ‘As a senior citizen, are you willing to take a chance on your survival in exchange for keeping the America that all America loves for your children and grandchildren?’ ” Patrick said. “And if that’s the exchange, I’m all in.”
>
>Patrick added that “that doesn’t make me noble or brave or anything like that. I just think there are lots of grandparents out there in this country like me … what we all care about and what we love more than anything are those children.”

“ The greater Houston region has a higher hospitalization rate for those who tested positive for the novel coronavirus than New York, where the brunt of the nation’s cases and deaths have been recorded, and Wuhan — the Chinese city where the illness originated.

In the seven counties with known COVID-19 infections — Harris, Fort Bend, Montgomery, Galveston, Brazoria, Liberty and Chambers — 26% of patients from March 4 through Sunday wound up hospitalized rather than being sent home to quarantine, according to a Houston Chronicle analysis of data. The diagnoses are based on the testing of people who are symptomatic with coughing, a fever or shortness of breath.

During the same nearly three-week period in Harris County, health officials reported that 15 out of 51 people had been hospitalized.

Due to a shortage of test kits and protective medical equipment, many counties in the area have limited testing to only the sickest patients. The first drive-thru testing sites opened in Harris County last week and at least 1,750 people have since been tested.”"

2020-03-23,fartwiffle,minnesota,9,https://www.reddit.com/r/minnesota/comments/fnqjrt/well_this_is_a_little_jarring/flbf1xi/,"Mortality rate varies fairly widely by country depending on how thorough their testing was and the strategies that country put into place.  

South Korea, for example had a surge of cases due to [Patient 31](https://graphics.reuters.com/CHINA-HEALTH-SOUTHKOREA-CLUSTERS/0100B5G33SB/index.html), but overall had very high testing numbers and a solid societal strategy to isolate known infected cases without completely overwhelming all of their healthcare resources.  South Korea also learned from their 2015 MERS outbreak and understand the importance of back-tracing cases to trace down all individuals with contact.  South Korea is now trending downward in new infections and appears to have resolved their first wave of the virus.  South Korea, last  I checked, had a mortality rate of about 0.9% for Covid-19.

Italy has struggled through this pandemic and might have a mortality rate as high as 7 or 8% right now even with fairly decent testing saturation.  Italy hesitated to put strict social distancing or shelter in place measures in effect early on, a scenario that nearly all Italians now [regret](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/20/coronavirus-italy-lessons-countries-crisis-information).  Since putting full shelter in place orders into effect last week and having actually started to enforce those orders Italy is now starting to finally see a leveling off of new diagnosed cases.

[Iceland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_coronavirus_pandemic_in_Iceland) has done more Coronavirus testing per capital than any other country in the world.  They also have a solid healthcare system and have put reasonable measures in place.  They have a very low mortality rate as a result as they only have one known death so far.

China's overall mortality rate from Covid-19 is so far around 4%, however the Wuhan province accounts for most of that.  The mortality rate of other Chinese provinces is similar to South Korea's.

Here's some math showing what the difference in mortality rate is in the US between 1% (South Korea where the government knows what they're doing and had a great response), 3.4% (current global average), and 6% (countries like Italy and Iran that had awful initial responses similar to what the US has as a whole currently) and using the low end estimates of 40% infection rate:


  | 1% Mortality | 3.4% Mortality | 6% Mortality
---|---|----|----
US Population | 330,000,000 | 330,000,000| 330,000,000
40% Infection Rate | 40% | 40%| 40%
Infected US Pop.| 132,000,000 | 132,000,000  | 132,000,000 
Mortality Rate | 1% | 3.4%| 6%
US Covid-19 Deaths | 1,320,000 | 4,488,000 | 7,920,000

Here's that same chart with a 70% infection rate

  | 1% Mortality | 3.4% Mortality | 6% Mortality
---|---|----|----
US Population | 330,000,000 | 330,000,000| 330,000,000
70% Infection Rate | 70% | 70%| 70%
Infected US Pop.| 231,000,000 | 231,000,000  | 231,000,000
Mortality Rate | 1% | 3.4%| 6%
US Covid-19 Deaths | 2,310,000 | 7,854,000 | 13,860,000

Also, please keep in mind that these are strictly Covid-19 deaths when discussing these varying mortality rates.  This doesn't account for an individual who has a heart attack or gets into a automobile accident that can't get hospital treatment because ambulances, emergency rooms, ICU beds, doctors, and nurses are all overwhelmed handling Coronavirus patients.

Regarding infection rates, 40% is fairly reasonable considering that approximately 10% of Americans contract seasonal influenza each year, a virus that we have vaccinations for and the population has some herd immunity to.  Also seasonal influenza has a [lower base reproduction \(Ro\) value](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_reproduction_number) than Coronavirus, meaning that Coronavirus is somewhere between 1.5-2x as contagious as common seasonal influenza.   Even if the infection rate was only 25%, much lower than the estimates Walz threw out, we could see somewhere between 1 million and 5 million US deaths.

Please don't be Minnesota's Patient 31.  Stay the frick home."
2020-03-23,MarkTwainiac,GenderCritical,9,https://www.reddit.com/r/GenderCritical/comments/fnmcn2/the_coronavirus_is_killing_far_more_men_than/flbfe66/,"Chinese scientists also have suggested that this new coronavirus might lead to impaired fertility in young males who get COVID-19 but recover from it. This is because it often hits young males of reproductive age smack in the balls, leading to orchitis (inflammation of the testicles) as a result.

By contrast, the evidence from past outbreaks of SARS in Asia and MERS in the Middle East indicate that these new coronaviruses do not pose a threat to female fertility because the infection doesn't affect the ovaries or Fallopian tubes. However, in women who are pregnant, coronaviruses can affect the uterus and the placenta, particularly if the woman suffers a severe acute infection in the second or third trimester. Which is why world and national health authorities have issued special advisories for pregnant women.

It seems males are more susceptible than females to getting COVID-19 in the first place because of a number of biological differences between the sexes, and because males behave differently to females. Generally speaking, males have poorer personal hygiene, less awareness of how their actions affect others, a lower sense of social responsibility, a greater inclination to think that rules don't apply to them personally, and more delusions of physical invincibility.

Once males are infected with COVID-19, they seem more likely to suffer severe and life-threatening consequences than females too.  Which is also because of both biological and behavioral differences between the sexes."

FRIDLEY, Minn. — Medtronic has ramped up production of ventilators in response to the COVID-19 outbreak, and 3M has increased their production of N95 masks.

Medtronic officials say they've already increased ventilator manufacturing by 40% increase this year, and have plans to further increase their output.

""In the company's Ireland ventilator manufacturing facility, the company currently has over 250 employees dedicated to ventilator manufacturing and plans to more than double that number, including transferring staff from other Medtronic sites to support ramp up activities,"" according to a news release.

The minimum wage stipulation is also for the companies receiving aid. And people with student loans are affected and the bill includes ways to pay it for them for a while. Admittedly making penalty-free deferrals would have worked better imo.

>This case involves counterfeit unicorn drawings. The complaint includes a few examples of products that allegedly infringe Plaintiff’s trademarks, which offer “striking designs and life-like portrayals of fantasy subjects.” One example is a puzzle of an elf-like creature embracing the head of a unicorn on a beach. Another is a hand purse with a large purple heart, filled with the interlocking heads of two amorous-looking unicorns. There are phone cases featuring elves and unicorns, and a unicorn running beneath a castle lit by a full moon.

>Plaintiff has not demonstrated that it will suffer an irreparable injury from waiting a few weeks. At worst, Defendants might sell a few more counterfeit products in the meantime. But Plaintiff makes no showing about the anticipated loss of sales. One wonders if the fake fantasy products are experiencing brisk sales at the moment.

""Ninety  percent of the COVID-19 patients being cared for at Beaumont's eight  hospitals are over the age of 40,"" Geary said in the statement. ""This is  consistent with what other health systems across the nation are  experiencing.

“Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) insisted he is continuing to negotiate in good faith with Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and hopes to secure a deal as long as he can ensure worker protections are included, and that the fund for industries has appropriate controls. ’We have an obligation to get the details right, get them done quickly,’ Schumer said. ‘That doesn’t mean blindly accepting a Republican-only bill.’”

The direct harm from mass spread is that more vulnerable people die. The indirect harm is that people who were never infected by Coronavirus start dying as they can’t get medical care for injuries and diseases that would be easily curable in normal times. If the hospitals are overflowing and medical workers are getting infected, then easily treatable conditions like a ruptured appendix become deadly as care becomes impossible to obtain. Routine medical care in modern society keeps a lot of otherwise healthy people from dying unnecessarily. In scenarios of rampant spread, that system shuts down. Keeping the inflow into hospitals at a manageable level is to everyone’s benefit, not just to those who are infected."

srs N95s should be donated to hospitals.

But normal surgical masks (and even things like bandanas and scarfs) [can prevent droplets of the virus from being transferred to other people.](https://www.bostonglobe.com/2020/03/19/opinion/guidance-against-wearing-masks-coronavirus-is-wrong-you-should-cover-your-face/) It also makes it harder to touch your face, which is the primary method through which the virus enters your system.

Mask-wearing is common in Asia when people are sick and [has some measure of success in stopping the flow of the virus](https://time.com/5799964/coronavirus-face-mask-asia-us/). It could prevent an asymptomatic person from passing it on to someone else. Many countries don't have widespread testing yet, so this precaution can be useful.

A regular person wearing a fabric mask with three layers (or even a scarf/bandana/any of the DIY masks) is not going to prevent a hospital worker from getting a mask. Some hospitals are [even asking for people to turn in home-made masks](https://www.cbs58.com/news/local-sewers-asked-to-hand-sew-face-masks-for-hospitals-to-combat-supply-shortage) because they foresee they'll tear through their supply of masks and it's better than nothing.

Since not everyone can stay at home (see: people working the businesses considered ""essential"", people who have not been given permission to not go to work, going to get the groceries even if it's just once a week, etc.) taking precautions when you *must* go outside is better.

The reasons against mask wearing are mostly cultural (not common in Western countries, maybe combined with xenophobia of Eastern countries using masks?), with a misguided attempt at getting people to not use up the supply of masks. (It makes no sense to say ""don't wear surgical masks because they won't protect you, but leave them to medical workers because they need them."")

Wearing a mask outside is really awkward because most people aren't used to it and react very rudely. But since going outside is still required for certain peoples, it would be good to normalize the wearing of fabric masks.

EDIT: [This post](https://np.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/fl0la1/the_shortage_of_face_masks_is_so_severe_that_the/fkw07ml?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x) has a good write up about masks and why they are better than nothing."

It talked about a famine in China long ago that led to the establishment and the expansion of wildlife consumption in their wet markets. It also talked about how the SARS virus came from a certain wildlife and also started in China which caused the government to place a ban on wildlife consumption which proved to only be temporary until everything got better. As a result, (I think), Chinese wildlife consumption procured another virus.

These are my thoughts and what I've hear so far. I'm in no way an expert nor do I think these are 100% true facts because there are some counter arguments. For example, China isn't the only country to practice wildlife consumption but I also don't know how much wider the variety or how often it is practiced in China compared to other countries.

Tl;dr - Was the Coronavirus or some type of virus bound to happen naturally or is it because of wildlife consumption? If so; is it specific to China or should all countries practicing wildlife consumption be extra cautious?"

Well, that’s almost certainly the easiest way to get it. So keeping your distance from others greatly reduces your risk of infection.

But in a study out this week in the New England Journal of Medicine, researchers at a Montana biohazard lab run by the National Institutes of Health confirmed what many experts had feared: this coronavirus can also be infectious outside of a living body, in some cases for days.

The other night I watched the 2011 movie Contagion, which certainly has some eerie parallels to the present. There’s a scene where Kate Winslet’s character, a CDC disease investigator, explains why that kind of durability is so troubling in a virus.

[[audio from clip from Contagion]]

KW: “So at this point I think we have to believe this is respiratory—maybe fomites, too.

“What’s that, fomites?

“It refers to transmission from surfaces. The average person touches their face two or three thousand times a day…three to five times, every waking minute. In between, we’re touching doorknobs, water fountains, elevator buttons, and each other. Those things become fomites.”

The N.I.H. researchers tested whether the SARS-CoV-2 virus can spread via fomites—which, by the way, is how you actually pronounce it. They sprayed infectious droplets onto cardboard, stainless steel, and plastic. Then they checked the spatter as time passed to see how quickly the viral particles dried out and fell apart.

On cardboard, it took a good four hours before the amount of live virus started to fall significantly, and the surface remained quite infectious eight hours later.

So when an Amazon box appeared on my front porch a couple days ago, I was glad to see that the delivery man was wearing gloves. But after I opened the box, I still went to the sink and washed my hands.

On stainless steel—think railings, shopping carts, gas pumps, jungle gyms—the coronavirus remained infectious for more than a day.

And on plastic—so, our pens, our credit cards, our keyboards and keypads—it stayed viable for two to three days.

Here in the Seattle area, store managers and bus operators have been wiping down surfaces more frequently and making disinfecting wipes available at the door for customers to use. We now know that should be standard practice everywhere.

Inside that box I received from Amazon was a set of white cotton gloves that I had ordered for me and my family to wear when we go out.

Tests have shown that a standard face mask really doesn’t protect you from catching this virus because so much of the air you inhale leaks in around the edges rather than going through the filter. Wearing a mask is a nice courtesy, though, if you’re going to be around others who may be vulnerable.

But a pulmonary surgeon advised me to wear cotton gloves, as they do at his hospital, because the natural fibers trap the virus and it dries out and becomes inactive. Also, I find that wearing gloves helps me remember to avoid touching my face.

So we can get infected from people we never even see—from the fomites they leave behind.

But now let’s turn to that second question: can you catch COVID-19 from someone who hasn’t tested positive, or even from someone who may feel perfectly healthy?

Studies seem to confirm that the answer is yes. In a paper that appeared on March 16th in the journal Science, an international group of researchers analyzed data on the outbreak in China in January. They concluded that only 14% of COVID-19 infections were documented, meaning that 86%—that’s six out of seven cases—never showed up in the statistics as a confirmed case.

Here’s what Jeffrey Shaman of Columbia University, one of the authors of that paper, said about that in a news briefing last week:

JS: “These undocumented infections were … about half as infectious per person as a documented case who has more severe symptoms and maybe shedding more. Because, however, there are many more of these undocumented cases, it’s the undocumented infections that are driving the spread and growth of the outbreak.”

Shaman says these undocumented cases are mostly quite mild.

JS: “And so most people may not recognize that they may think they have another cold, or they may not even really recognize that they're ill. If you were to project that number globally, given that we have 150,000 confirmed cases … it says that we're approaching close to a million infections globally…. Generally, you’re looking at about an order of magnitude more cases than have been confirmed.”

VO: Of course, every day the count of confirmed cases rises. But the idea is that if you take the count today and multiply by seven, that’s a more realistic estimate of the number of infections to date.

So who is transmitting the virus? Obviously people who are very sick and have tested positive. Plus maybe seven times more people, many of them young, who have caught it but feel well enough that they wouldn’t think to get tested or to self-quarantine.

And then there’s a third group: the fast-increasing numbers of people who are infected, and who—five or ten days from now—will fall ill and become a confirmed case, but who feel perfectly fine at the moment.

In a preprint article published on March 18th, researchers with the World Health Organization studied 94 COVID-19 patients in Guangzhou, China to determine when they became infectious—and when they stopped shedding the virus. The scientists collected throat swabs from the patients as soon as they began showing symptoms and then tested them again every day for the following month.

They saw a lot of variation from patient to patient. But overall, the patients tended to become less infectious as their symptoms progressed. Through some calculations, the scientists concluded that these coronavirus patients shed the most virus, and were probably most infectious to others, up to two days before they started feeling ill. So these are people like Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky, who we learned on March 22nd has tested positive for COVID-19 even though he isn’t yet feeling any symptoms.

These W.H.O. researchers estimate that around half of the people who caught this virus in Guangzhou got it from someone who was still feeling healthy at the time. And other studies from China have documented cases where patients have fully recovered from COVID-19 but continued to test positive for the virus for more than a week after their symptoms disappeared.

This phenomenon of pre-symptomatic and post-symptomatic transmission really complicates efforts to contain this virus, in particular because it will be a long time before we have enough coronavirus tests to check people who aren’t yet showing symptoms.

In a move to help ease shortages of coronavirus tests, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration last week gave emergency authorization to hospitals and labs to use a new automated test for COVID-19 that can detect infections in minutes rather than days. Cepheid, a biotech company in California, says it will start shipping the test kits this week.

The Cepheid test performs essentially the same real-time-PCR process that existing tests do, just much faster, says Cepheid's Chief Medical Officer, David Persing:

DP: “So what we've developed is a reference-lab-quality test that can be run at the point of care in about 45 minutes or less. You take a sample, put it into this new cartridge that we've developed, and about 45 minutes later, you'll have the result. And that test can be run at the hospital as patients are being admitted. So the results are available much more quickly. And that means that those results will play into how those patients are managed: who gets respiratory isolation. Who needs antibiotics who doesn't need antibiotics? Those kinds of decisions can be made in real time.”

Persing says that while the test could be used for screening in the community—and may be sensitive enough to detect pre-symptomatic super-shedders—initially it will be available only for hospitals to use on their patients and healthcare workers.

DP: “We think this will be a very important tool in being able to get rapid, actionable results to let patients know if they're carriers, even if they're asymptomatic, to quarantine. And to know that they're being quarantined for a reason, not because they may have hay fever or some other cause, but really give them a reason for quarantine.”

Faster, easier tests should help us get a better handle on the true extent of this pandemic. But these tests aren’t perfect. A number of studies, including one done by scientists at Wuhan University in February, have found that these RT-PCR tests we’re relying on today aren’t sensitive enough to reliably catch the infection in its early stages. So a negative test result is no guarantee that you’re not carrying the virus.

Nor does it tell you whether or not you are immune to the disease. But new tests for immunity are coming.

These characteristics of the new coronavirus—it’s ability to lie in wait on surfaces and to spread easily among people who feel fine or well enough—that is what make this virus so contagious and hard to stop, as Elizabeth Halloran of the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center explained at news briefing last week:

EH: “the basic reproductive number—that is the average number of people that an average person infects at the beginning—is estimated … to be about 2.5. And there are actually estimates that are higher.

“That’s before, of course, all this behavioral reduction and social distancing which would reduce it. But it’s going to be difficult even if it does go down somewhat seasonally in the summer to bring that down necessarily below one.”"

""But there may be several reasons for Italy's alarming mortality rate.

The numbers we have are not representative of the entire infected population,"" said Massimo Galli, head of the infectious disease unit at Sacco Hospital in Milan, the main city in the worst-hit region of Lombardy where 68 percent of the total national fatalities have been reported.

Galli explained that as the emergency situation rapidly deteriorated over the past month, Italy focused its testing only on people showing severe symptoms in areas with high epidemic intensity - the result, experts say, is that the currently available numbers produce a statistical artefact, a distortion.

""This causes an increase in the fatality rate because it is based on the most severe cases and not on the totality of those infected,"" Galli said.

The coronavirus may take up to 14 days before an infection flares into symptoms such as fever and dry cough, and during that incubation period asymptomatic patients may potentially transmit it. Experts believe it is this so-called ""stealth transmission"" that has driven the rapid spread of the outbreak, infecting communities that remain unaware until they develop symptoms and get tested.""

Ciara and Russell Wilson have donated a bunch - specifically guaranteeing 1 million meals at their local food bank in Seattle. 

Brad Paisley has a ""free grocery store"" in Nashville that'll do deliveries so people don't have to risk exposure to the coronavirus. 

Ariana has done a bunch of awareness posts, including advocating for a specific bill to guarantee sick pay for workers, and donating to specific charities. Yesterday she asked her stans to DM her and gave a bunch of them money/support. 

There's plenty more, I'm sure. But also plenty of useless ones - I just saw Sia getting dragged for tweeting something like ""~~vir~~us"". Vanessa Hudgens is gonna be haunted she ever said something so dumb on ig once people's parents and grandparents start dying.

I have a theory about this. I think its because  politics took a really reactionary turn after Obama, and the percentage of people 50+ using social media started growing extremely fast in 2010. This is the vestiges of the tea party in social media, and the cancer that was it was has bled across the aisle in the boomer demographic over the last ten years. (https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/fact-sheet/social-media/). 

As anecdotal evidence, every time I open Facebook where I am friends with a lot of boomers, they primarily post about insulting the youth (however cringey it may be), posting keith richards music videos from 2004, and bashing democrats like pelosi. so a lot of these people who were consuming shit like Glenn Beck's ACORN shit on Fox News in 2010 are now given echo chambers that stewed and grew over the last ten years. And there has been a lot of shit over the last ten years that has not made boomers that happy. 

boomers have their heads as deep as possible into the sand to drown out opposing views that social media/the internet expose them to, because its hard not be be confronted with shit like coronavirus and climate change etc etc online due to the nature of media today. 

their voting patterns reflect it because they are trying to drown out reality, because they don't like how easy it is to be exposed to it now and it may be the only power they have left.

Major U.S. airlines are drafting plans for a potential voluntary shutdown of virtually all passenger flights across the U.S., according to industry and federal officials, as government agencies also consider ordering such a move and the nation’s air-traffic control system continues to be ravaged by the coronavirus contagion.

No final decisions have been made by the carriers or the White House, these officials said. As airlines struggle to keep aircraft flying with minimal passengers, various options are under consideration, these people said.

But amid the quickly spreading pandemic and mandatory stay-at-home orders covering some 80 million U.S. residents, airline executives, pilot-union leaders and federal transportation officials said they increasingly view as inevitable further sharp reductions from already-decimated schedules in passenger flights."

The Hubei provincial government bungled the initial response. They suppressed information early on, arrested the doctor, and downplayed the problem. They absolutely deserve some blame for this pandemic. We might even be able to say that the provincial government's failures are due to structural issues in China with the central government being too strong and controlling.

BUT. Once Xi and the central government realized there was a problem (about mid January), they took strong, decisive and effective action. They followed science, they tested, they were transparent in the numbers. They coordinated a cohesive response across the country. They mobilized government, military and the private sector. They made decisions with much less information known about the virus than we have today (I.e. they did not know the R0, they did not know the mortality rates, they did not have a full understanding of the symptoms and behaviour of the virus). Most of those decisions turned out to be the right call. And they implemented social distancing quickly and effectively. When we compare the Chinese response to the western response, we see competence, science, gutsy decision making and ultimately we see positive outcomes.

I'm frankly embarassed by Trump's leadership and decision making. The safest place in the world right now to be is China. America can't even get basic testing working. It's like a fucking third world country. Slow, bureaucratic, insanely expensive for everything related to health care. Uncoordinated responses. Politicians who claim you can be cured from the coronavirus by breathing in hot air from a hair dryer. Ultimately we are going to see massive numbers of infections and deaths. The contrast between the two responses shows good leadership vs incompetent leadership. The Chinese economy hit some road bumps, but it is not devastated. We'll see what happens to the American economy, but it's not going to be good.

Now in the aftermath, China is the first to recover and is in a good position to help out others. They are doing some carefully crafted PR (which we might be able to say isn't entirely selfless); they are perhaps trying to take advantage of their situation to maximize their economic benefit. I think most countries would do the same. 

I hope American manufacturing and business can rise to the occasion and meet at least domestic needs. People like Elon Musk give me glimmers of hope. But with the dysfunction in our politics, divided nation and incompetent president, we will probably screw this up too. And China will make boat loads of cash helping the western world crawl out of the pandemic and rebuilding. Maybe it's not so different from the US helping Europe rebuild after WW2.

But I'm sure we'll find a way to look down on China and tell them our way is better."

The time for joking about Covid-19 is over. Now is the time to keep yourself, your loved ones, and everyone else safe. And I'm devastated to say that now is also the time to mourn.
Natasha S. Ott passed on today. She was a profoundly kind, passionate, funny and loving 39-year-old woman in good health. She was a Peace Corps alumni who liked to curse... and she loved those who were fortunate enough to be close to her with every ounce of her heart.

The absolute least-interesting thing about her was the way that she died, but I'd like to talk about that here now because I'd like everyone to wake-up to the reality of what we are facing.
On Tuesday, March 10th she wrote me to tell me she was feeling a bit sick: ""Like a respiratory cold. Tiny fever.""

She worked for Crescent Care as a social worker for clients who are HIV positive. They sent her home, but didn't test her - she was told she was low-risk.

She wrote me the following on March 11th: ""I tried to go to Ochsner today to get a flu test and they told me it would be a week before I could see my PCP. I ended up getting it at work. We only have 5 coronavirus tests at my clinic. I declined to take one so someone else could."" Natasha worked for Crescent Care - an organization dedicated to providing treatment to people who are HIV positive. This organization that provides healthcare to the highest of high-risk populations had 5! coronavirus tests available on March 11th, and she elected not to use one. The flu test she did take ended up coming back negative.

On Friday March 13th she wrote: ""Hey, they don't think I need to get tested unless I develop a fever. All looks well.""

On Sunday March 15th she wrote: ""Hey, I'm not feeling so hot still. I may be testing at work tomorrow. I'm probably fine. I just tried to drink some medicinal whiskey and feel unwell. I'm ok. I love you.""
On Monday March 16th I asked her if I could bring her some Pho, and she wrote: ""Nothing, thank you. I'm ok. I don't have an appetite.""

She did get tested for Coronavirus that day, and was told it would take up to 5 days to see results.

On Tuesday March 17th I asked ""How you feelin?"" and she replied: ""Ok :)""

On Wednesday March 18th she wrote: ""I walked Zola and am worn out."" She also wrote: ""I just want to drink whiskey"" and sent me an article about a 25-year old man that claimed whiskey cured his Coronavirus.

She wrote: ""I don't want to be sick anymore"" and ""I just don't understand why I don't feel much better yet.""
On Thursday March 18th she said: ""Also, if you're offering dog walking services today, I'd like to place a request.""
She also wrote ""This moms soup from WFs is the tits"" and ""I feel like if I had to go into battle, I'd rather have an ax than a sword"" and ""I think Zola is worried about me"" (Zola's her dog).

I went by that evening to walk Zola. Natasha was feeling a bit better. She had more energy than she'd had in days, and she ended up walking Zola with me. She did complain that she felt like 'something' was in her lungs. She also mentioned that her Coronavirus test results were delayed, and likely wouldn't come back until Monday.

We made plans to watch a movie together Friday evening (remotely) round 8.

On Friday March 19th she wrote: ""Good morning! I love you.""
To my lasting shame, I replied: ""Morning, sunshine. How you feeling?"" I very much wish I'd said ""I love you"" back.

She sent her last message to me at 8:36am in response: ""A little better and hopeful. The herbs seems to be helping.""

At 6:54pm I texted, with no-reply.

I called twice, with no-reply.

I wrote: ""I'm getting nervous. Just called twice. Text or call me soon. If I don't hear from you within the hour I'm coming over there to check on you.""

I got to her house around 8. No one answered the door. I walked to the back of the house and noticed the rear door that opened into her fenced yard was open (she left it open sometimes so Zola could go in and out).

I went in the back, and found her dead in her kitchen. For those of you not fortunate enough to have known her - know this: it's an immeasurable loss. And seeing a woman I knew to be so full of life lying on the floor lifeless was devastating. I was afraid to touch her. I held her anyway.

Her Coronavirus test results have still not come back.

Know these things, friends:

- Our government is ill-prepared for this pandemic in a way that has and will cost lives.

- Cherish your loved ones like you could lose them, and let them know you cherish them.

----
Update - what I wish I'd done differently, two days later:

I'm not a doctor, but I did talk to my friend who is an ICU doctor before posting this. Still, take my advice with a grain of salt.
I'm seeing tons of news stories that say you should stay home if you have 'minor' symptoms. But I haven't seen anyone delineate what a 'minor' symptom is.

Tasha was a stoic soul, and her tone of voice and joking demeanor made everything sound like not so big a deal.

But she told me on Thursday evening that she felt like 'something' was in her lungs.

- shallow breathing is not a minor symptom
- feeling like there's lung congestion or fluid in your lungs is not a minor symptom

If you or a loved one feel like there's fluid or congestion in their lungs or is experiencing shallow breathing, seek medical attention immediately.

Don't wait on a test status, don't wait to see if things will feel better tomorrow.

This self-assessment can help you figure out what to do if you have symptoms: https://gehrcovidtriage.akidolabs.com/"

No one is debating what the money can be used for, it is that Mnuchin could literally give a no interest loan of $500 billion to Trump's businesses based on the way the law is drafted.  Given his past actions, this is not surprising for Democrats to be suspicious of his motives.

Both sides are playing politics, Trump wants to give money to his donors and supporters (business elites) and dems want to do the same to their supporters (working class people).  To pretend the dems are wicked devils and house and senate Republicans are all morally righteous saints acting in purely altruistic manner is not only dishonest but delusional.

Politicians do not act in altruistic manner, we know that, several Republican house members have been caught doing insider trading ahead of coronavirus.  There are bad people on both sides."

That number is complete horseshit.  
As a country, Mexico is waaay too close to the US, they haven't really done much when it comes to international travel and whatever they have done has come too late, a massive concert and a massive Comic Con were held last week and the week before that we had country wide protests that involved thousands and thousands of people flooding the streets in the most crowded way possible.

Democracy activists in Hong Kong have embraced the Wuhan label and agreed with Trump about it being a ""Chinese virus,"" while Taiwan's CDC, media, and netizens all use ""Wuhan pneumonia"" as a standard label.  

As a Taiwanese and Hong Kong American, I'm not to happy with those labels because of how it's wielded against Chinese Americans and the collateral damage for Han Chinese and Asians in America, regardless of origin. I also think part of it is rooted in anti-China sentiments that, while fair enough for the CCP, have tinges of elitism when directed against Mainland Chinese *people*. There has been a long series of wedge issues that have been used to elevate HKers and Taiwanese over Mainlanders, and this is just the latest one.

I understand the desire to resist both the CCP and WHO. I also get reluctance to consider requests for alternate framing when the CCP has such a track record with politically motivated tone policing. I even get that people in HK and Taiwan aren't as clued into racial dynamics overseas. But conflation of the Chinese government with the concept of China or Chinese people is still wrong, whether back in HK and TW or in America."

Worried Americans are scrambling to buy wellness products they think will protect against coronavirus. Some may do harm.

In the past few weeks, Ashley Koff, a registered dietitian in Columbus, Ohio, has gotten a deluge of requests from people who want to know which dietary supplements they should take to protect themselves from the coronavirus.

People ask how much elderberry syrup, colloidal silver and oil of oregano they should take to boost their immune systems. One person who tested positive for the coronavirus and was sent home from a hospital to recover texted Ms. Koff asking for supplement recommendations. Others wonder whether they should drink ample amounts of kombucha and use essential oils as hand sanitizer.

“Someone asked me if they should do a detox juice cleanse and I told them absolutely not,” said Ms. Koff, who is the chief executive of The Better Nutrition Program, which provides nutrition advice to individuals and corporate wellness programs. “Someone else asked me if they should be doing a fast. I told them anything that’s depleting your body of resources right now is going to increase the risk of you getting sick.”

Dietary supplement sales have surged nationwide as panicked consumers stock up on vitamins, herbs, extracts, and cold and flu remedies. None of these products have been shown to lower the likelihood of contracting the coronavirus or shortening its course, and taking large doses of them can potentially do harm. But experts say that the jump in sales suggests many people are desperate to strengthen their body’s immune defenses and ease their heightened anxiety levels.

“The numbers we are seeing are unprecedented,” said Joan Driggs, an analyst at IRI, a market research firm that tracks supplement sales at Walmart, Walgreens, Safeway, CVS and other drugstores and retailers. “People are trying to protect themselves, and they feel that they have to take advantage of whatever resources are at hand.”

While sales of dietary supplements rose 6 percent over all during the first week of March compared to the same time period last year, according to IRI, sales of cold and flu remedies surged. Sales of vitamin C, a purported immune booster, soared 146 percent, while sales of zinc, a popular remedy for colds and respiratory illness, shot up 255 percent. Sales of elderberry supplements, which are marketed for immune support, are up 415 percent. Echinacea, an herb used for cold and flu relief, jumped 122 percent.

Vitamin D and multivitamins for children and adults have also experienced unusually sharp spikes in sales this month. So has melatonin, which some studies have shown may aid sleep. Ms. Driggs said that the growth in melatonin was probably related to an increase in stress-related sleep disruptions. “It signals to me that there are higher levels of anxiety,” she added. “People are frightened for their family’s health and well-being and also their financial well-being.”

Across the country, pharmacies dealing with dwindling supplies have placed limits on the amounts of vitamins, Zicam, Emergen-C and other supplements that customers can purchase. One large supermarket chain with 230 stores in seven states, Harris Teeter, restricted sales of Airborne, which is marketed for immune support, to three packages per customer.

The frenzied buying has led some companies and wellness enthusiasts to prey on public fears. Countless natural remedies for coronavirus have circulated on social media, including herbs, saltwater, creams, toothpastes and “miracle mineral solution,” a mixture of sodium chlorite that the Food and Drug Administration has warned is tantamount to drinking bleach.
In response, the F.D.A. and Federal Trade Commission sent warning letters to at least seven companies warning them to stop advertising fraudulent cures and treatments for coronavirus, including essential oils, elderberry teas and colloidal silver supplements. The agencies cautioned that colloidal silver in particular is “not safe or effective” for any disease or condition. They said they were monitoring websites and social media to root out bogus products and that a task force has worked with major retailers and online marketplaces to remove dozens of listings for fraudulent coronavirus cures and treatments.

Americans already have a high level of anxiety about the spread of coronavirus, said Joseph Simons, the chairman of the F.T.C. “What we don’t need in this situation are companies preying on consumers by promoting products with fraudulent prevention and treatment claims,” he added.

Five of the major supplement industry trade groups applauded the government action and urged consumers to be wary of products making coronavirus-related claims. The industry has also lobbied the federal government and state and local officials to classify dietary supplement makers as “essential” in areas where there are shelter-in-place ordinances restricting nonessential commerce.

“I think the fact that we’re seeing this spike in sales tells us that consumers absolutely value their ability to use supplements,” said Steve Mister, the president and chief executive of the Council for Responsible Nutrition, an industry group.

The fastest selling supplements are those that have long been the subject of research on cold and flu relief, including zinc, vitamin D and elderberry extract. Zinc is thought to inhibit replication of the virus that causes the common cold. Some randomized trials have found that taking high doses of it may help to lower the risk of contracting a cold and potentially shorten its duration by 20 percent.

Supplementing with moderate doses of vitamin D has been shown in some trials to help lower the risk of contracting the cold and flu, but the effect is mainly seen in people who have very low or deficient levels. And a handful of small, industry-funded trials have found that elderberry extract can shorten the duration and severity of the cold and flu.

But the evidence for most of these supplements is not strong, and it’s not possible to extrapolate that they will help prevent or treat coronavirus because they have some efficacy against the cold and flu, said Kamal Patel, a nutrition researcher and the director of Examine.com, a large and independent database of supplement research. These viruses are quite different from one another. The coronavirus, for example, has a more severe impact on the lower respiratory tract and a longer incubation period compared to the viruses that cause colds and influenza.

Taking large doses of single vitamins and minerals also carries risks. Excessive levels of zinc, for example, can disrupt the body’s uptake of copper, increasing the likelihood of anemia. Vitamin D is not metabolized efficiently without an adequate level of magnesium, and in high doses it can be toxic.

Vitamins and herbal supplements can also interact with prescription medications, dampening their effectiveness or, in the case of blood thinners, for example, raising concentrations to dangerously high levels.

There are times when taking a supplement can be very useful, such as during pregnancy or to address a clear nutrient deficiency. But for healthy adults who are worried about the coronavirus, eating a nutritious diet and getting proper sleep and exercise are the best ways to strengthen your immune system, said Linda Van Horn, chief of nutrition in the department of preventive medicine at the Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine.

Whole foods like fruits, vegetables, fish, poultry, nuts, legumes and milk contain a wide range of vitamins, minerals and phytochemicals — including zinc and vitamin D — that work in synergy to protect your health.

“This is an ideal time to look at what you’re eating,” said Dr. Van Horn. “We all know that grocery stores have been experiencing some limitations. But for the most part people are still able to find fresh produce and other healthy foods.”

Ms. Koff, the dietitian in Ohio, said she tells people it is fine to take a multivitamin to address any gaps in their nutrition. But she encourages people to focus on their diet, stress levels and sleep and warns them not to overload their systems with large doses of supplements.

“This is the time to start implementing behaviors that support your health, not going and taking high amounts of things that are incorrectly listed as immune boosters,” she said.

BTW, I thought the NYT was making all COVID-19-related coverage free to everyone? Did that change?"

My point, as you well fucking know, is that you can, right now, go into any grocery store or pharmacy and get more hours and better pay than at the paint counter at menard’s.  I would imagine, as I would ask you to imagine with me, that a plucky individual who applies to one of these jobs early, as warm bodies are most in demand, might be able to ask for preferred hours and duties.  Mr paint counter who waits until he is laid off in six months might have to lower his expectations.  That’s probably true.

If you are a welder who got laid off, that would of course presumably be a decrease in pay from when they were working as welders.  Thanks for so helpfully pointing that out.  

However, if you’re standing around exposing yourself to coronavirus by bored customers who can’t live in their own houses for a few days during a extraordinary lockdown, all the while trying to contaminate you with their stupidity as they spend 30 minutes trying to decide what color of pale yellow they want their kitchen to be, you might as well go stock shelves for customers who need to be customers at that particular time."

“So many people are rushing into Minneapolis’ most popular parks during the coronavirus pandemic that it’s hard for them to give everyone their recommended 6-foot separation.

The Minneapolis Park and Recreation Board is now urging people to visit smaller neighborhood parks or other regional parks instead, and will potentially take other measures to keep people spread apart.

The activity on some parks in recent days was reminiscent of what is seen during a busy weekend in July, parks spokeswoman Dawn Sommers said Monday. Many crowded the city’s well-known destinations, she said, including the Chain of Lakes and Minnehaha Regional Park.

“Apparently they’re packed with people on the trails,” she said. “There are so many people out on them that people aren’t self social distancing.”

The Park Board is making signs to urge people to practice social distancing, Sommers said. Workers may also be at parks reminding people to do the same, Park Board President Jono Cowgill said.

The Park Board is discussing whether it should close off parkways to vehicles, a tactic being demanded by some on social media.”"

I work for a Chinese company (with several employees in Hubei province) so I got the inside scoop really early on. Many healthcare workers, families and young people with no underlying diseases were dying. Some died in self-quarantine, others on the streets but the majority in the hospitals. They insisted on taking precautions really early on. I will not forget the fear and dread in their voices when they found out Spain wasn’t going to lockdown after a few 100 cases. Loads of Chinese shops closed in Madrid before the lockdown due to concerns of how chilled everyone was. Another thing they said is extremely important, wearing a face mask. I know the media is telling us to not wear them because of shortages but if you are sick (without realizing it) and sneeze or cough (hell even speaking can cause droplets to come out of your mouth), then you are going a good deed. If everyone wears a face mask, with social distancing, the results will be a lot better. Singapore, South Korea, Taiwan, told their citizens to wear face masks. So did China. Why are we doing the opposite?

Moving on.

I live in Madrid and I started social distancing in mid-February. Having worked in the medical industry in Madrid before (public and private) and seeing first-hand how Spain’s government has been deteriorating throughout the years, I knew this coronavirus was a ticking time bomb. The people of Spain will need to rise up after this and demand re-elections. One of the best public healthcare systems was in a political tug-o-war. Spending was going down every year with more attention on the private healthcare and people were being put on long waiting lists for necessary therapy, surgeries and medications. Anyhow, Sanidad (governing public healthcare) laughed and said countless times that Covid19 was not a threat and people’s lives were not at risk in mid-late February. Some friends who wanted to practice social distancing were told by their companies they would be fired if they didn’t come in to work. “Not until the government mandates”. BS

The situation as you all know is only getting worse. The president said last week that Spain enforced the harshest containment measures in Europe if not the world. Yet he still hasn’t answered to their lax policies weeks before, like allowing hundreds of thousands of people do the feminist march in Madrid on the 8th of March, the shortage of testing kits, masks, sanitizer and toilet paper. A bunch of politicians were infected shortly after the 8M march but the government maintained the status quo until it was too late. The famous ice skating rink in Madrid has now been turned into a morgue, triage, hotels into temporary hospitals for mild-moderate covid19 patients and the state of emergency has been extended another 2 weeks, until the 11th of April.

Everyone should be wearing masks. Don’t buy into those BS articles masks don’t do jack.

This has been discussed heavily and I am copying this answer from a really good answer supplied by another post.


Allow me to share with you the little-known secret that literally every study regarding mask usage has shown that they help to prevent healthy wearers from becoming infected with respiratory viruses (even in real-world conditions and worn by the general public):

[national institute of health](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2440799/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf) 

Home-made cloth masks reduce permeation even of tiny 0.02 µm–1 µm particles by 50%, with surgical masks reducing permeation by 75% even during real-world activities.  Considering that droplet transmission viruses (like the one causing COVID19) often require larger droplets than that, these masks could be even more effective against this particular virus.

Quote:

Any type of general mask use is likely to decrease viral exposure and infection risk on a population level, in spite of imperfect fit and imperfect adherence, personal respirators providing most protection.

 [International Journal of Infectious diseases](https://www.ijidonline.com/article/S1201-9712(08)01008-4/fulltext) 

This one shows surgical masks preventing the wearer from being infected when living with someone who has the flu.

Quote:

We found compliance to be low, but compliance is affected by perception of risk. In a pandemic, we would expect compliance to improve. In compliant users, masks were highly efficacious.

[Journal of the American Medical Association](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/184819?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf) 

This study of 446 nurses in Ontario hospitals showed that n95 masks and surgical masks offered similar protection from viral infection for the wearer.

Quote:

Our data show that the incidence of laboratory-confirmed influenza was similar in nurses wearing the surgical mask and those wearing the N95 respirator. Surgical masks had an estimated efficacy within 1% of N95 respirators.

[National Institutes of Health](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17096360?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf) 


Surgical masks offer almost as effective filtration efficiency against simulated particles as n95 masks.

Quote:

The in-vivo filtration tests illustrated that N95 respirators filtered out 97% of potassium chloride (KCl) solution, while surgical masks filtered out 95% of KCl solution.

And for the coup de grâce, here's one published in
[Emerging infectious Diseases](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/15/2/08-1167_article?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf) 

 (the journal of the CDC) with a juicy quote:

We present the results of a prospective clinical trial of face mask use conducted in response to an urgent need to clarify the clinical benefit of using masks. The key findings are that <50% of participants were adherent with mask use and that the intention-to-treat analysis showed no difference between arms. Although our study suggests that community use of face masks is unlikely to be an effective control policy for seasonal respiratory diseases, adherent mask users had a significant reduction in the risk for clinical infection. Another recent study that examined the use of surgical masks and handwashing for the prevention of influenza transmission also found no significant difference between the intervention arms (12).

Our study found that only 21% of household contacts in the face mask arms reported wearing the mask often or always during the follow-up period. Adherence with treatments and preventive measures is well known to vary depending on perception of risk (27) and would be expected to increase during an influenza pandemic. During the height of the SARS epidemic of April and May 2003 in Hong Kong, adherence to infection control measures was high; 76% of the population wore a face mask, 65% washed their hands after relevant contact, and 78% covered their mouths when sneezing or coughing (28). In addition, adherence may vary depending on cultural context; Asian cultures are more accepting of mask use (29). Therefore, although we found that distributing masks during seasonal winter influenza outbreaks is an ineffective control measure characterized by low adherence, results indicate the potential efficacy of masks in contexts where a larger adherence may be expected, such as during a severe influenza pandemic or other emerging infection.

 But, even if you ignore all of those studies, we now know that asymptomatic transmission is a major driver of new infection
[here](https://edition.cnn.com/2020/03/14/health/coronavirus-asymptomatic-spread/index.html?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf) 

and therefore the CDC and WHO should be recommending that everyone wear a mask (home-made if necessary) to reduce new infections.

P.S.

The myth that people would wear the masks incorrectly and increase their chance of infection has no data whatsoever to back it up.  And is in fact contradicted by the second study on this list which featured normal people using masks in real-world conditions and having a reduced rate of infection."

Buenos Aires asegura tener transmisión local, casos en los que ya no se puede determinar con seguridad de donde provino el contagio, otra vez como ya mencione anteriormente nada nuevo bajo el sol, especialmente si se tiene en cuenta el drama del Argerich donde personal de contacto estuvo trabajando (comienzos de marzo) con un infectado (primer fallecido) con antecedentes de viaje a zona de riesgo pero sin tomar precauciones adecuadas, lo que podría haber facilitado la libre circulación del virus, se dice que aislaron a 16 personas que mantuvieron contacto con este paciente, pero acá viene la pregunta... ¿Podemos tener la certeza de que solo esos 16 aislados contendrían lo inevitable? La realidad nos dice que el margen de error es una posibilidad y que tal vez uno o dos que quedaron fuera de este grupo pudo haber comenzado cadenas de contagios. Algo que se esperaba.

Se que suena preocupante, pero de acá a esta parte y te diría que desde el paciente cero a hoy se ha procedido bastante bien dentro de lo que podría haber sido, a nivel politico y de conducción (si bien difiero del gobierno actual, no lo soporto) me saco el sombrero en lo que respecta al accionar y las medidas de control, hemos llegado al desenlace inevitable, y a esta altura ya no importa tanto el numero de contagios sino mas bien el cuidar de los otros y a nosotros mismos siguiendo todos los protocolos y respetando las medidas impuestas

Como le he dicho a muchas amistades, si acá terminamos como Iran o como Italia no es por falta de conducción sino por falta de educación!
Quedará ver que decide el gobierno apartir del inicio de esta fase, pero evitar la paranoia y tomar perspectiva sigue siendo el ejercicio adecuado, asi como quedarse en casa y respetar el distanciamiento social! Se que es dificil, contrasta con nuestras argentinisimas costumbres pero es hasta que pase, ya volveremos a la normalidad!

This part of the article caused me to literally laugh out loud. Its abundantly clear that the author has no understanding of how to evaluate relative risk. Consider this: we know that in 2018 the mortality rate for car accidents was [11.2 deaths per hundred thousand](https://www.iihs.org/topics/fatality-statistics/detail/state-by-state). Lets compare that to the mortality statistics for COVID-19 in the US. In America COVID-19 has an observed mortality rate of [1.2%](https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/country/us/) (as of 3pm on Monday March 23). This means that the per capita lethality rate is about 1,212 deaths per hundred thousand. This means that COVID-19 is roughly 108 times more lethal than a car accident. 

So yes, obviously we dont want to reduce all non-emergency speed limits to 10 MPH, but if the motor vehicle accident fatality rate suddenly spiked to 100+ times greater than the current mortality rate I imagine we'd all be talking about proper safety and operation regulations for motor vehicles and Im willing to bet you'd be A LOT more cautious about getting into your car for a Sunday drive."

I’m also about to play Animal Crossing: New Horizons, and AC in general relaxes me a ton. It’s a form of self-care for me, which makes other forms of self-care, like feeding myself, come more naturally. 

What relaxes you? Maybe doing something relaxing for yourself, like drinking hot tea or listening to music, will make it easier for you to eat (you’ll be in a better mood, and it will also distract you a bit from the negative feelings that come with eating). 

Maybe take a step back from the dieting, intuitive eating, etc. information right now. During the times when I’ve sought these things out instead of taking care of my emotions first, it’s pressured me more into trying to be a perfect eater, and it makes my habits worse if I feel like I’m not living up to my expectations.

I’d also recommend unfollowing any news, meme, or etc. subreddits, because they feature the coronavirus a lot. I’m currently only following video game, baking, cooking, and art subreddits, because they relax me. 

Best of luck! Stay safe. ❤️"

2020-03-23,harpyeaglelove,collapse,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/collapse/comments/flr7j8/megathread_mar_20_spread_of_sarscov2/flblwvz/,"# Trump's Press Conference: The elderly will be sacrificed to keep the economy going.

 **TLDR:  Trump is now clearly hinting of the fragility of the economy, and that the ""cure might be  worse than the virus"".  The elderly will be sacrificed to prevent  broader, more sinister consequences of a collapsed economy.** 

The biggest take home message from this press conference today was during Trump's first few questions and answers.

""The  cure might be worse than the virus"" talk, and how Trump is strongly  hinting towards opening up the economy back up after 15 days.

""The economy wasn't designed to stop going..."" etc.etc.

We all know that 15 days isn't enough.  Trump hinted that his doctors on his staff wanted to ""shut down the entire global economy"" - **sounds like there's two birds whispering in Trumps ears.**

**Bird 1)**  Scientists:  Shut down the global economy and knock down the curve to sustainable levels, and get prepared to deal with future outbreaks.  This virus has an R0 value as high as smallpox, and is impossible to detect, and the 20% critical illness rate could cause the collapse of our healthcare first, followed by the collapse of the remainder of society.

**Bird 2)**  If you shut down the global economy, and listen to the scientists, we have absolutely no way to ""re-start"" the economy.  It's a ponzi scheme, and the people currently obey our stupid laws and keep us in office because they believe they have a future.  We must tread a fine line between shutting down the economy partially and condition the sheep into understanding they must work their meaningless jobs, and sacrifice the lives of their parents.  The system must never stop, it cannot slow down, it must keep moving forward - there's scary climate change related consequences like global dimming that could trigger tipping points, which would result in far worse consequences than the sacrifice of our elderly population.

**Thus, a sacrifice must be made.**  This is the new Normal.  We will learn to ""live with the coronavirus"".  With an R0 as high as 7.0, 14 day asymptomatic spread, and short term immune response, this virus will come back year after year, slowly hacking away at our immune systems.  We'll essentially be chronically ill on an annual basis as this virus damages our major organs until we're not functional enough to keep participating in the workforce.

Looks  like we're being conditioned to sacrifice the elders of our society in  exchange for continuation of the global economy.  They did their part,  they put a system in place, and now it's natural selection.

**Quotes that clearly indicate knowledge that the economy is fragile, and more important than human life:**

""Life is   fragile, economies are fragile....""

""My number one aim is the worker, we need to take care of the workers"".

""The faster we get it going, the better chance that stores will re-open"".

""sooner than people think - we are in a position to have the country go up like a rocket ship economically""."

It’s become a big thing on social media and a bit of a competition (Mormons are very big on the “keep up with the Joneses” thing).

Because of corona, missionaries are returning home early (they’re usually out for two years). Their friends and family have decided to ignore the “no large gathering” rule and the explicit instructions of the LDS church, who told them to have one parent come and wait in the car for their missionaries then take them home for two weeks of quarantine instead of having these large welcome parties.

So now a lot of people are crowding together at the airport as they welcome their young adult friends and family who are coming from around the world. It’s like easymode for any virus that wants to spread.

EDIT: Just looked at some stats. There are about 70,000 LDS missionaries working in nearly 400 missions (regions) worldwide, most of them young adults. They have just ordered that all non-native missionaries from at least a quarter of those missions return home in the coming weeks.

It’s unknown how many people are in those missions (I don’t know if they’re divided evenly) or how many of them will be returning home to Utah, but we can probably expect several thousand young missionaries (and their germs) to return home to Utah in the next few weeks.

So if the government doesn’t get stricter and/or the people continue to not listen to the church’s advice about collecting returning missionaries, many of those missionaries will be greeted at the airport by family members and friends. Then all those family members and friends will go home and spread the disease to everyone around them. And Utahns are very big on family togetherness so they may go visit grandma and grandpa and spread the disease to people who will be more likely to need hospital visits and ICU stays.

Long story short, Utah has the potential to have a very widespread coronavirus problem."

They had an expert on BBC News earlier with some apparently encouraging news about how effective social distancing will be.

He said, one person will infect on average 2.5 people over 5 day if there are no measures put in place and you do nothing.  Over 30 days with all the chains of transmission that translates to 406 people becoming infected from that one person.  However, if you manage to cut that number by 50% with new measures so that the average person only infects 1.25 people, over 30 days only 15 new people will be infected rather than 406.

That's a huge reduction.

But here's the problem, it's still being passed on.  And as soon as we go back to normal in 12 weeks time (or whenever) it's going to spread like wild fire again.  

If we go 18 months in lockdown, we're going to have debt levels that will make Greece look fiscally responsible.  In fact the whole world will.  And that's not sustainable.

Whatever option you take, the future looks bleak.  

I haven't begin to describe how bad I think things will get as I don't want to get into fear mongering, but I'm hoping someone can cheer me up here, and give me some factual reasons why it won't be as bad as I think it'll be.  And I think it's gonna get pretty bad.  It might well be  that eventually in 6 or 9 months time we have to say that Coronavirus is just something we're gonna have to live with and go back to normal because the economy going on the brink of collapse will likely be even more disastrous and deathly."

Pretending this current crisis will lead to social revolution is the same wishful thinking that the left has done for the past 100 years. Without an organized international working class, there is no possibility of the working class gaining power even if revolutionary conditions emerge. In the absence of an organized working class, the state and capitalists will take advantage of this crisis to further concentrate wealth and power. What we are seeing is an authoritarian mode of capitalism tightening its grip. Even now, the US is considering suspending habeus corpus.

There are no short cuts here. Imagining that the coronavirus is going to ""wake up"" the working class is the same old accelerationist fantasy we've been hearing from anarchists and anarcho-communists for years now.

There certainly will be *some* changes after this is all over. And I do hope that people begin to realize the extraordinary power that the working class have. But it will not happen overnight. Can you imagine if grocery workers and municipal workers all went on strike at this very moment? Sadly, poor wages, the lack of organization, and the reserve army of unemployed mean such a thing is quite unlikely."

In psychology, temperament broadly refers to consistent individual differences in behavior that are biologically based and are relatively independent of learning, system of values and attitudes. Some researchers point to association of temperament with formal dynamical features of behavior, such as energetic aspects, plasticity, sensitivity to specific reinforcers and emotionality. Temperament traits (such as Neuroticism, Sociability, Impulsivity, etc.) are distinct patterns in behavior throughout a lifetime, but they are most noticeable and most studied in children. Babies are typically described by temperament, but longitudinal research in the 1920s began to establish temperament as something which is stable across the lifespan.Although a broad definition of temperament is agreed upon, many classification schemes for temperament have been developed, and there is no consensus.Historically, the concept of temperament (temperamentum in Latin means 'mixture') was a part of the theory of the four humors, with their corresponding four temperaments.

I doubt you’d be able to find a source to confirm this in either direction because, once again, scientists don’t just make statements like that easily.

Based on our knowledge of other coronaviruses, chances are we exhibit immunity. If the virus evolves similarly to the flu, then we’d likely be immune to the specific strain we caught but not future mutations of the strain. Both of these outcomes are more likely than the possibility of being able to catch the same coronavirus a second time. I don’t think you’ll find a definitive answer on this any time soon, so the best we can do until then is predict. And my prediction is that, at the very least, you won’t be able to catch the same strain of the virus again. Relapse seems to be a possibility, but not reinfection."

This leads to a 70-100% chance of cognitive impairment when leaving the hospital and a 20% chance of continued impairment 5 years later. Almost all patients who survive ARDS have significant declines in quality of life for years after they “get better” and leave the hospital. 

Typically ARDS is not a rapid onset thing. It can take a while to get to this stage but for some reason with COVID19 it progresses rapidly. 

So a 40 year old they were just giving oxygen to the day before is fighting for their life the next day. They don’t know why it happens so fast but it’s one of the severe characteristics of COVID19 disease. 

Thank god not everyone gets it but it seems roughly 20% of people require hospitalization with coronavirus.

Well what is happening with the Coronavirus is a TIMELINE TRIGGER.

We are witnessing the acceleration of the change over from the broken legacy systems, into the new systems to support humanity’s rising consciousness.  

We are moving from hierarchy, centralization and control. Into decentralization, and distributed forms of governance thwart will allow us to move out of the power Elites control systems and allow us to become sovereign and free.

If you have been observing the crumbling of the financial markets, the legacy financial system has its origin in the Babaloynia timelines, where spells were put on the money supply and the fractional reserve banking system was born.

Here the money changers started to lend out more money than they held in reserve and began the debt-based financial system that we see existing in the Federal Reserve today.  The worlds Financial System is the Lynchpin of the controller network that keeps humanity in enslavement.

In order to get from where we are to a free and sovereign system, we have two go through the experience of the crumbling of the old system, just as the new system is created and takes over.

What we are experiencing right now, is the crumbling of an old outdated system of money and Governance. While we are experiencing real human tragedy, illness, deaths,, fear, isolation, panic, and a break down in society.  These are all inevitable precursors to the purging of an old way of collectively living and being.

This first stage needs to happen if we are to rebuild into something better."

In a peer-reviewed study released last week, scientists assessed the data on more than 2,000 pediatric patients across seven provinces in China who were diagnosed with the coronavirus between January 16 and February 8.

They found that 90% of the children were either asymptomatic or had mild or moderate COVID-19 symptoms, including 39% who developed pneumonia without showing obvious symptoms, around 50% who developed a fever, fatigue, sore throat, cough, or shortness of breath, and 4% who showed no symptoms at all. 

However, 6% of the children developed critical or severe infections, including one 14-year-old boy in Hubei province who died of COVID-19 infection.

On March, 18, the World Health Organization cautioned parents to prepare to safeguard their children against the coronavirus.  Dr. Maria Van Kerkhove, head of WHO's emerging diseases and zoonosis unit, cited the study that was released a day earlier.

""What we need to prepare for is the possibility that children can also experience severe disease,"" Kerkhove told reporters.”
