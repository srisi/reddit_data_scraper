News from Wenzhou a few hours ago were cause for huge concern here, because Wenzhou has 10,000 Americans and is the richest city you've never heard of.  They announced that every household needed to appoint one person, who would be identified to authorities that are outside every residential compound.  That person--and only that person--would be allowed to leave every other day for food.    


There are videos of people on quarantine and who are suspected of having the virus--they're not sure because there aren't nearly enough testing kits--are being blockaded in their homes with bars welded across the front doors.  Those are extreme cases but they're being done by people in uniform.

Par for the course, doctors who spoke up get locked up. This doesn't look like it will fizzle out like SARS, we'll see.

**By** **Joseph Goldstein**

* **Feb. 2, 2020Updated** **11:01 p.m. ET**

A day after New York City’s health authorities said that a woman was hospitalized with [the city’s first suspected case of the new coronavirus](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/01/nyregion/coronavirus-new-york-city.html), the authorities on Sunday announced that two more patients also might have the virus.

Samples from all three patients must first be tested at a laboratory in Atlanta that is run by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to determine whether any of the patients do in fact have the new coronavirus.

The turnaround time for receiving the results is usually at least 36 hours, but often longer. Local health departments are not yet able to test for the new illness themselves.

But based on a number of factors — the type of symptoms; the patients’ recent travel in China; and the exclusion of influenza and some other common illnesses through testing — the New York City health authorities are taking quite seriously the possibility that these patients may have the virus."

2020-02-03,JeffreyBenjaminBrown,Coronavirus,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/exzzc6/current_coronavirus_cases_17388_confirmed_362/fgeuko0/,"Here's a simple back-of-the-envelope calculation. (I am a statistician with no medical expertise.)

# Assumptions

## The death rate among infected people is 2%

This is currently the best estimate we've got. It's an unbiased assumption, but it's not a precise one, because we don't have good data.

The inside-China death rate has been around 2% consistently for at least a week. China could be downplaying the problem -- but even then, if deaths and infections are under-reported at the same rate, the inferred death rate is accurate. It's not clear to me which (deaths or infections) is easier or more desirable to miscount; one would cause an upward bias, the other a lower bias.

Note that the outside-of-China death rate is based on somewhere between 50 and 100 people, and 1 has died. Based on that data lone, you'd expect a death rate between 1 and 2%.

## The disease cannot be contained.

Some epidemilogists think containment at this point is impossible. Some don't, but even those optimists think it will be hard.

Note that containment efforts are still useful, even if ultimately doomed, because they buy us time to figure out how to deal with the disease.

## 12.5% of exposed people will contract the illness

The WHO[0] estimates that influenza has an R0 between 1.2 and 1.6. R0 is the average number of new people infected by each carrier. A preliminary WHO estimate[0.5] suggests that nCoV2019 has an R0 of 1.5-3.5. So it's probably more infectious than the flu. But I don't know how much more, so I'll just assume it's the same.

Thus, this is an optimistic assumption.

I can't call this an authoritative source, but WebMd says[1] 5 to 20% of the US population gets the flu each year. 12.5% is the average of 5 and 20%. 

In applying the 12.5% figure to the world, I'm assuming US flu risk is the same as world flu risk. I suspect the truth is worse. (I live in Colombia, and I've got to say, sanitation in the US is a world apart.) So that's another source of optimism.

But note that this estimate is off by at most an order of magnitude -- you can't have more than 100% of exposed people contract the flu.

# Implications

By these assumptions, in the long term, 12.5% of the world population will get nCoV2019, and 2% of those people will die, every year. 2% of 12.5% of 7.7 billion people is about 20 million people -- a global mortality rate 20 times worse than malaria.

For the US, it implies 817500 deaths per year. Currently, about 2.8 million people *total* in the US die each year[1.5]; this would mean an increase of almost 1/3. The CDC says between 12,000 and 61,000 people die every year from the flu in the US[2], so this would be between 13 and 68 times worse than the flu.

People will be afraid and they want to make sure they do not have the flu.       
Every small thing that feels like them bieng sick or whatever make,s them rush toi the hospital.        
The large amount of non infected and infected poeple gathering will do 2 things.     
1. It will help spread the virus.       
2. It will put a huge strain on the hospital system.       
Because a lot of poeple that show up are not infected ( but still require tests ) a lot of the infected poeple are stuck whit those not infected @ the hospital.       
Lots of poeple will start faking feinting ( in the hope to get tested faster ) to get out of this mess.

Lots of the infected in Wuhan have recovered in the sense that they aren't showing symptoms but they still have counts of the virus when tested. Some people have been tested as precaution because of exposure to infected family that never showed symptoms at all but continued to test positive.

Btw. Your updates are wrong. HIV drugs can be used for other viruses because many viruses share similiar mechanisms of infection. 

You can use HIV drugs for Hepatitis B. And people found out during the SARS epidemic that people on HIV treatment have milder symptoms.

That‘s why doctors can try HIV drugs for nCoV. And no, nCoV doesn‘t have „HIV INSERTS?!!!?!!“.
It has short patterns that are somewhat similar to HIV surface protein folds. But that‘s very vague and there is no functional proof for their claim."

a) “the media is making a small issue, huge”. No. the media is not why I’m concerned. The data and epidemiological models coming from reputable journals are what concern me. If anything, I think the media is collectively under-emphasizing this issue. 

b) “not many people are infected or dead”. I would strongly disagree with that and I don’t think you have any basis for that statement. What numbers are you looking at? How do you know for sure? And what is “many people” to you?  

And c) “the only people dying have bad immune systems”. Hey guess what? I’m willing to bet that someone you care about falls into the category of people who are technically elderly or have “compromised immune systems”. I’m tired of  people acting like the “old and infirm” are people we are all willing to just throw away. I’m not.

They aren't testing people that haven't been to or have had close contact with someone that has been to China recently.

This virus does well on non porous surfaces. 

They would rather the American public believed the only way to carry the virus is direct contact with those that have recently been in China. 

Anything else would freeze America in its tracks.  Hospitals would fill up with paranoid people,  people would stop going to work / school,  public services would stop, etc.  

I truly believe they are working on how to get ahead of this thing before true information is released. 

I live in Maine.  I saw on the news tonight after the game that they closed down an elementary school for 3 days for extensive cleaning as recommended by the CDC because students were getting the flu.  What?  Ive never seen that before.  

The notion that the only way to be infected by this virus is visiting China or direct contact with someone who has is ludicrous.  Especially if you consider the shelf life and all the ways one could contract a virus.  

This virus has been known since December.  Hundreds of thousands of people have come to America from China in that time.  We are only testing folks that have been in China the last 14 days. The symptoms are not unique and present similar to flu, cold,  pneumonia.  

Keep your hands clean.  Avoid close proximity contact with others.  Question everything and trust your intuition despite what others feel."

Just 4 days later on Jan 10, a first genome was released on Virological.org only to be followed by five more the following day via GISAID.org. From very early on, it was clear that the nCoV genomes lacked the expected genetic diversity that would occur with repeated zoonotic events from a diverse animal reservoir. 

The simplest parsimonious explanation for this observation was that there was a single zoonotic spillover event into the human population in Wuhan between mid-Nov and mid-Dec and sustained human-to-human transmission from this point.

 However, at first it was a struggle to reconcile this lack of genetic diversity with WHO reports of ""limited human-to-human"" transmission. 

The conclusion of sustained human-to-human spread became difficult to ignore on Jan 17 when nCoV genomes from the two Thai travel cases that reported no market exposure showed the same limited genetic diversity. 

This genomic data represented one of the first and strongest indications of sustained epidemic spread. As this became clear , Mr. Virologist spent the week of Jan 20 alerting every public health official that he knows."

Ask yourself... If you were battling flu for 4 weeks. What favourite foods would you like at home?

... and buying water, that's just a waste of money. You can disinfect water by boiling if it come to that. If we run out of water and gas, your stockpile will be damn useless.

Get your self some comfort carbs, treats and cans of your favourite food. Its nice not to have to cook when feeling ill,  have a few cans of your favourite ready meal to sit and watch TV with while you get over this.

Buy beer instead of water.. maybe some wine. 
Im going for a few bottles of port, and cheap whiskey - warm them up, that'll keep you well. 

It isn't the zombie apocalypse. And if it was, prepping won't help at all.

I can't say which is which but just by looking at the published official data you can see there are a lot of infected under treatment, the deaths are low but also the recovered ones, the death no. is low only right now because of available staff, masks, beds, oxygen tanks, anti-viral meds, etc. If the cases rise which is projected the patients will overwhelm the staff and supplies.  
  
This virus is dangerous because it can survive much longer on surface (5-6 days) and even worse is it wont show symptom for another 4-6 days, which makes it very infectious, during which you might spread it to work colleagues, family members, public transport, etc. So even if the death rate was only 0.1% instead of 2-3% the ability to go undetected makes it a threat.  
  
The SARS virus spread once you started feeling off, and initial cough, fever develops, during which you could seek help and also take precaution to protect others. US/Europe might be able to provide beds and medical staff like China but countries in South america, Africa, Middle-east and Asia won't be able to handle. They definitely wont be able to quarantine a city with armed forces the way China does."

Low temperature (\~5C) and low humidity (20-35%) and a virus can survive significantly longer and spread better than in high heat and humidity.

One could safely say it takes atleast 5 days from diagnosis to death.

That means the death rate is much much higher. Instead of dividing 362/17493 cases today.

Divide 362/6,000 the cases on 1/27/2020 and you have a ±6% mortality rate.

Imagine if it's 10 days from diagnosis to death, you have a 362/639 which is an apocalypse inducing +50% mortality rate.

Which isn't the case thankfully, but untill we know the time it takes to kill you we have a very real possibility of under counting the mortality rate. Even if all of China's numbers are 100% accurate."

This time, we are riding on the back of a government & police force that people have absolutely no trust in. 

The sense of order and trust in the rule of law that HK has been famous for is also strained. People firebombed proposed quarantine quarters, a bomb exploded in a hospital bathroom and another was found on our absolutely world class public transport.

The 'recovered' figure is important precisely because it marks a top for the potential mortality rate. Until people recover, they are still sick and they may still die from the disease. 

So, you have a lower bound for mortality rate dividing the people that already died by the people that have been identified with the virus, and an upper bound for the mortality rate dividing the people that died by the total number of ""final outcomes"" (dead+recovered).

Of course, I would like to know more exactly the meaning of ""recovered"". Probably means no symptoms and virus no longer detected. But did they get immunity from renewed infection?"

What I find odd is that many of us sharing information aren’t that worried. Yet it seems to be those accusing us of sharing facts calling us doomsdayers who are the ones panicking. It doesn’t enter my mind that facts equate to panic. It says to me to keep an eye on it and get ready to be prepared. Would you bet your families life on not being prepared ?  

I don’t have a family so it’s not for my benefit that I’m sharing this. And I’ve survived something with a 25 % death rate. I’m not suggesting it’s doomsday. I’m saying this is a worse virus than we have been told. And since every news outlet so far agrees with that it would make sense to make some preparations. 

Every mask on the planet seem to have been bought up. Even in the U.K. where no one is that worried. A few are of course. But that’s natural. I have a higher opinion of the human race than most. I believe facts equate to preparedness. Not panic. And right now since those facts seem to be rather liquid we need to keep on top of it."

At the moment the data essentially just gives a snapshot in time but that's not very useful for identifying what those figures might mean in the bigger picture. These figures don't even tell us the change since yesterday so then we have to try and hunt those figures down elsewhere. Just really wish there was one place I could go to give me all the data. Some useful data:

1) What is the daily growth as a percentage, both today and for every day since the outbreak? This shows if it is accelerating, decelerating or stable.

2) How do the growth rate figures compare when broken down in to these regions:

a) Wuhan

b) China

c) China excluding Wuhan

d) The world, excluding China.

This website goes some way to showing historical data but it doesn't break it down in to regions:

 [https://www.coronavirusdata.org/trending-ncov-confirmed-cases/](https://www.coronavirusdata.org/trending-ncov-confirmed-cases/) 

Since this outbreak will be in different stages of growth in the above regions, it may be useful to see how they compare.

3) Break down historical data by official infections and deaths. The above graph only gives historical infections but not deaths. So I don't know what the percentage growth rate is for deaths. That's another critical piece of data to identify the progress of the virus. Since many commentors are stating the official infected figures are wrong because the authorities can't test everyone due to lack of kits, well then the deaths must be more accurate as you don't need a test kit to identify if someone's died but they will have known by then if they were infected."

I think it’s already too late, The novel coronavirus is here. 

I suspect almost all international flights will have infected people, staff or surfaces by now. You can try wearing a proper mask & gloves - don’t touch your face,. But it may be also transmitted through shit & vomit, so even a few particles floating around could infect people. 

Take care & please self isolate if you can until we know more. Please. It’s probably the only way we will be able to reduce the rapid spread of this virus. And you’ll be protected from all the idiots here who are too fixated on petty political bickering & fawning over the fucking BAfTAs & upcoming Academy awards to notice what’s happening. 

Very few, if any people here are taking this seriously, so I can’t trust that people will isolate themselves to protect others. The only people that are as alarmed & informed as me live overseas. It’s ridiculous. I’ve finished stocking up on essentials, Thursday this week will be the last time I will visit a public place & I’m hoping there won’t be many people there. 

I’ve already stopped purchasing fresh produce, meat (as with the measles outbreak - sneezing/coughing will  contaminate food) or buying food prepared elsewhere. I’ll get boxed/frozen groceries delivered if I run low & go to a remote beach or other unpopulated areas  if I need to get out of the house. If I touch anything outside of home, I use hand sanitizer after. I use a paywave card. I’m also getting into the habit of disinfecting surfaces, especially door handles. 

I’m not sure how viable it will be to visit my family members in the coming weeks but they’re perceptive people & are taking what I’m sharing with them on board. I have major issues with my immune system so I self isolate during flu season anyway. 

Oddly enough, my horrible immune system means I’m well prepared for this outbreak because I’ve been forced to keep myself alive & well on my own for years as our public health system & general attitude towards basic hygiene & not sneezing all over people is so backwards & shitty. 

After I almost died from influenza about a decade ago I ramped up my interest in pandemics & virology. Started researching historical data & records, everything I could get my hands on. This virus has so many red flags. The economic consequences of this outbreak alone is going to throw everything into chaos. Be prepared.

>Most importantly, we report the first recorded isolation of a live SL-CoV (bat SL-CoV-WIV1) from bat faecal samples in Vero E6 cells, which has typical coronavirus morphology, 99.9% sequence identity to Rs3367 and uses ACE2 from humans, civets and Chinese horseshoe bats for cell entry. Preliminary in vitro testing indicates that WIV1 also has a broad species tropism. Our results provide the strongest evidence to date that Chinese horseshoe bats are natural reservoirs of SARS-CoV, and that intermediate hosts may not be necessary for direct human infection by some bat SL-CoVs. They also highlight the importance of pathogen-discovery programs targeting high-risk wildlife groups in emerging disease hotspots as a strategy for pandemic preparedness."

They just react and do as their told because they are too busy with day to day. The clinician in charge and the management will have been aware of PHE’s official advice hence the move to ambulance. The delay will have been consultation with lead microbiologist as to whether or not they need to refer directly to PHE and start testing or to follow protocol and send patient home with advice to call 111 herself. That is the current advice but it seems counterintuitive to most practitioners. They don’t like losing control over the situation.

Wear a mask, wash your hands, and avoid going out if you don't have to go out.
