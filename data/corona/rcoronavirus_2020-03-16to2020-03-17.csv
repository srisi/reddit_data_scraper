Emergency doctor Ignace Demeyer warns about this.  ""We see people with a blank medical history who are very ill.""  It's not just about older generations, either.  ""We have had very few older people inside so far,"" says Dr. Demeyer.  ""We now have people between the ages of 30 and 50 coming in.""
 
 
 ""They all have the same complaints,"" says Dr. Demeyer.  ""They have been sick for a week, stayed home with the flu. The flu attack is over, they think. They feel fine for two days. And then they report with complaints of a dry cough and shortness of breath. When we then have their oxygen saturation (level of  oxygen in our blood, ed.), we see that they have very low oxygen saturations for their age. ""

 At that time, a clear alarm goes off to the doctors that it concerns problem patients, but people themselves do not always realize it because they do not feel very ill at the time.  ""They just walk in, but they are terribly affected by the virus.""  Emergency doctor Demeyer also shows scans of the lungs of such a corona patient.  ""The images we took yesterday are nothing short of terrifying.""

 Inflammatory fluid
 The picture on the left shows normal lungs.  In the second photo, there are already alveoli that are 20 to 25 percent filled with inflammatory fluid.  The third scan is one step worse: it contains 80 to 90 percent inflammatory fluid.  ""Those people can of course still heal, but it is a life-threatening situation. And they are people who do not smoke, they have no other condition such as diabetes or heart failure. They are sporty young people.""

 Virologist Steven Van Gucht shares that concern.  ""That is one of the reasons why we advised the government to implement those drastic measures and why we ask everyone to follow them strictly.""  Doctor Demeyer calls ""some irresponsible behavior"" that some young people still do not see the seriousness and organize parties or go on weekends.”"

Free, high volume, widely available, fast ramp up. Identifying nearly every active case is a pretty big deal. 

I'm sure you've read about this, but testing in the USA up to this point has been severely lacking. Frankly its shameful in the richest country in the world, with the amount of money we pump into healthcare. Some leaders seriously dropped the ball.

I work in an ER. Here are the criteria for receiving a test: 

* cough / fever / SOB & contact w/ a known + case. Notably, known + cases are almost certainly far below actual + cases, because, again, testing criteria are very limited.
* atypical pneumonia requiring hospital admission, exhibiting signs characteristic of COVID19 on imaging

In other words, almost every + case that does not exhibit very serious pneumonia or symptoms+contact with the limited # identified, is not being identified. Most + cases don't develop serious pneumonia. Many + cases don't exhibit symptoms. We know there is community spread, so there is contact with unidentified +s. 

So. It's painfully apparent to clinicians that plenty of + cases will go, and are going, unidentified. Identifying all of those cases seems necessary for controlling community spread."

This appearance looks similar on CT if the airways are partially filled with fluid like in patients with heart failure.

The “whiter” the lung is in these patients, the more inflammatory debris there is filling the airway. That means less room to move oxygen into the bloodstream. So I guess the more lung that is replaced by “white” the more scarier it appears.

But to me, it just says “there’s an abnormality which is nonspecific and can be seen with other viral infections or non-infectious cause.

Bottom line is, take anything the media posts about these patients’ imaging findings with a huge grain of salt."

This is the American way - unless it affects *me*, the best I'll be urged to do is post on social media. Nobody took it very seriously when shit was hitting the fan in China. Hardly anyone took it seriously while shit hit the fan in Iran and then Italy - The US CDC could have been preparing all of that time to take the measures we're only now starting to roll out and not even on a national level yet.

 Now that it's slowly started to affect us, we're slowly starting to take action. Unfortunately, we're still not doing enough and we won't until it gets progressively worse and the American population slowly begins to realize this *can* and *is* affecting our normal day to day life now.

And, although it's convenient, we can't even put this all on Trump. Okay, he fired the pandemic team when he got in office. Okay, he cut funding to things like FEMA or the CDC. But that still doesn't excuse us for not having some sort of action plan, already in place, long before Trump and a global pandemic actually broke out. It also doesn't excuse our pathetically small stockpiles of essential medical supplies, especially respirators/masks and PPE gear.

We are all trying to ""flatten the curve"", which means an equal amount of infections than letting it run wild, just over a longer period of time (2 years, instead of 3 months).

The end result of ALL Western countries is the same: 40%-80% of our countries' populations will be infected, creating (hopefully) herd immunity.

Not a single Western country is (currently) trying to contain and erradicate it like they are doing in China and South-Korea."

Edit: this strategy heavily relies on the (currently unproven) fact that you build permanent immunity after recovering, and cannot contract it again. 

Edit2: I also realise 1% is really conservative and assumes ICU beds are available. Death toll jumps to over half a million if ICU is overwhelmed or curve is not flattened very soon. Things are not looking good for us."

Q: What were the new symptoms you discovered?

A:  Almost all of the infected people we surveyed, so roundabout 2/3, described a loss of the sense of smell and taste for several days. A mother even reported that she was unable to smell her baby having full diapers,  whereas others stopped smelling their shampoo and noticed that the taste  of their food vanished.  
We can't say when these symptoms occur, but we believe it's at a later stage of the infection.

Q: How many infected people did you survey?

A: At least 100, but not the most severe cases that are hospitalised.

Q: How would you describe a typical Covid-19-Patient?

A: The  typical Covid-19-patient presents with only mild symptoms. This is also  what a chinese Study from Shenzhen demonstrated. It showed that 91 % of  the patients demonstrate only mild to moderate Symptoms, with a dry  cough, and possibly fever. Our data showed a loss of smell and taste.  Furthermore 30 % of the cases showed diarrhoea, that's a lot more common  than previously thought."

* Trump said the health guidelines aimed at mitigating the spread of coronavirus could extend into the summer. The president said experts have told him to expect that this new reality could extend into July or August and possibly longer.



* Trump says he's not currently considering nationwide lockdown


* “At this point, not nationwide,” Trump said. “We may look at certain areas, certain hotspots.”
A number of European countries and US states have announced lockdowns in recent days.
“We look forward to the day that we can get back to normal,” Trump said.

* Trump was asked about his comment yesterday that his administration has “tremendous control” over the coronavirus crisis.

* The president said he was not claiming the White House has control over the virus itself. “If you’re talking about the virus, that’s not under control for any place in the world,” Trump said.

* In comparison to his past comments on the pandemic, the president’s remarks today sound much more grim and thus more in line with comments from health experts.

* Trump said he was not currently considering implementing a national curfew to mitigate the spread of coronavirus.

* In a surprising note from this president, Trump said he believed the media has been “very fair” in its coverage of the crisis.

* Trump also expressed support for the airline industry, which is seeing steep financial losses because of the crisis.

* The White House has now said Americans should avoid gatherings larger than 10 people in order to slow the spread of the virus.

* Trump also said Americans should “avoid discretionary travel” as the administration tries to mitigate the virus’ spread.

* Dr Deborah Birx, the White House coronavirus response coordinator, specifically addressed millennials and asked them to comply with the health guidelines to protect more vulnerable

* These latest guidelines, which advise Americans to avoid gatherings larger than 10 people, will be in effect for 15 days, Fauci said. Then the coronavirus response team will revisit them. However, Fauci said experts expect coronavirus cases to continue into the summer and possibly later."

* Chronic-inflammation which reduces the lungs' ability to extract oxygen from air, leading to earlier onset of hypoxia and organ damage
* High blood pressure results in overstressed heart as it has to beat more and more to try and supply oxygen starved blood to the body (Covid-19 causes the lungs to struggle to extract oxygen, especially during pneumonia), resulting in cardiac arrest
* Antivirals are less effective
* Hospital stays for recovery roughly double
* Immune response tends to be delayed for all infections, so bacteria coinfection in the lungs is more common, resulting in sepsis
* Diabetes obviously just makes everything worse

Obesity rates by country:

* South Korea: 4.7%
* China: 6.2%
* Italy: 19.9%
* United Kingdom: 27.8%
* United States: 36.2%

So 36% of our population has double the mortality risk and will require double the recovery time in hospitals."

* Have a set of clothes you wear outside, trousers and long sleeves, cover as much as you can. Cover your hair, wear goggles and a face covering of some sort. If you can't do that, sunglasses and just be very very wary of touching your face while out. Think of your hands as foreign objects and always be aware of what you touch.
* When you get back home, take all outside clothing off, best to do so in a place that can be avoided by everyone, like a garage. Clothes should be sprayed down with an alcohol or bleach solution if you can, but either way, pack them up in a garbage bag. Best to have enough outdoor outfits to keep them closed up for over a week.
* Leave shoes outdoors if you can.
* Head straight to the bathroom and wash your hands thoroughly, then take a quick shower.
* Once clean, attend to any purchased items back in the garage, and put on gloves. Disinfect all packages with either a bleach solution and a rag or an alcohol spray. Let it all sit for 10 to 12 minutes. Naturally, try to only buy things you can do this for. Be mindful of ventilation.
* After doing that, take off the gloves and again wash hands thoroughly. Now you can put on indoor clothing and bring in the purchased items. If you can, leave them for as long as possible.

It'll feel like overkill, but it will be very difficult for the virus to get past all of that and into your home. Better safe than sorry!"

ROME - ""The vast majority of people infected with Covid-19, between 50 and 75%, are completely asymptomatic but represent a formidable source of contagion"". The Professor of Clinical Immunology of the University of Florence Sergio Romagnani writes this at the top of the Tuscany Region, in anticipation of a strong increase in cases also in the Region, on the basis of the study on the inhabitants of Vo 'Euganeo where the 3000 inhabitants of the country are been subjected to swab.

The immunologist explains that the data provided by the study carried out on all the inhabitants of Vo 'Euganeo highlight two very important information: ""the percentage of infected people, even if asymptomatic, in the population is very high and represents the majority of cases above all, but not only that, among young people; and the isolation of asymptomatics is essential to be able to control the spread of the virus and the severity of the disease "".

For Romagnani, what is now crucial in the battle against the virus is ""trying to flush out asymptomatic people who are already infected because nobody fears or isolates them. This is particularly true for categories such as doctors and nurses who frequently develop an infection. asymptomatic by continuing to spread the infection between them and their patients. "" And again: ""It is being decided not to swab doctors and nurses again unless they develop symptoms. But in light of the results of Vo 'study, this decision can be extremely dangerous; hospitals risk becoming areas of high prevalence of infected in which no infected is isolated "".

In Vo '- Romagnani points out - with the isolation of infected subjects, the total number of patients fell from 88 to 7 (at least 10 times less) within 7-10 days. The isolation of the infected (symptomatic or non-symptomatic) was not only able to protect other people from contagion, but also appeared to protect against the serious evolution of the disease in infected subjects because the cure rate in infected patients, if isolated, was in 60% of cases equal to only 8 days."

There is no more time, we no longer have beds where to hospitalize people, we are forced to reuse personal protective equipment, because they are scarce, and in many situations those available are not suitable. We are in constant danger, we know that we risk contagion every day, as well as experiencing the constant fear of bringing the virus into our homes. There is not even time to cry, if not at the end of long exhausting shifts. We see death that does not have the dignity of being celebrated, people far from their affections. We are tried, we are few in hospitals and in the territory, we go to people's homes as soldiers at the front, without protections in a territory that cannot accommodate the huge requests for treatment, we are alone. If we do not stop this avalanche we will pay the greatest tribute, the failure of the whole system and of everything for which it makes sense to live. We need hospitals, staff, now, not tomorrow. We need qualified professionals, not recycled, not thrown to the front as pawns. We also need you dear citizens, shut yourself in the house, every exit opens the door to the virus.

And secondly The virus worsens/attacks  your lungs even if you dont show the symptoms and is still not know if that shit later in life wont have you begging for drugs for pain relief or other shit.

If still wanna cal it ""just a flu"",  a lot of you faint at minimal fever and act like zombies, or get diarrhea even from a simple cold and think is normal,  or headaches from a normal runny nose and think they have good health now that they are healthy.

I’m an ICU nurse and I work in a trauma hospital in the US. We have had the tests for a little while but until recently we weren’t allowed to test people unless they’d travelled to one of the countries on the CDC list or had come in close contact with someone who had traveled. We have a patient who our infectious disease specialist said was highly suspicious. On X-ray it looked like pneumonia but the pneumonia didn’t make sense given the patient we were looking at. Pneumonia doesn’t normally need any special precautions other than hand hygiene and maybe a mask if you’re suctioning them and aerosolizing droplets. 

Luckily the ID doctor convinced our infectious disease department to take the threat seriously. This was about a week ago before our town had a confirmed case. We placed the patient on very strict droplet precautions and we limited staff. Only 1 staff member (the RN) was allowed in the room per shift and whenever the nurse entered the room another staff member had to watch through the window to make sure that there was no cross contamination or break in PPE. It took 4 days to get the CDC and the Health Department to finally relent and allow us to test the patient. The test was done and sent to the capital for processing. A few days later it came back as positive.

If our ID doctor and department hadn’t been so fucking amaze balls then the entire hospital would have been completely contaminated.

Do you know how many staff walk into any given patient’s room per day? It’s a minimum of 2 nurses, 2 to 4 techs, housekeepers, dietary, the manager, therapists (like PT and OT), and doctors. Not to mention family, friends, other visitors, and the chaplains. 1 sick patient can easily pass the virus directly to a dozen people a day.

Do NOT go to the hospital unless you’re dying. If you’re sick then call your doctor and ask them what you should do. If you have teledoc or nurse phone triage then use it. Please be responsible, people."

Coffins have filled up two hospital morgues, and then a cemetery morgue, and are now being lined up inside a cemetery church. The local newspaper's daily obituary section has grown from two or three pages to 10, sometimes listing more than 150 names, in what the top editor likens to ""war bulletins.""

By death toll alone, the coronavirus has landed in the northern province of Bergamo with the force of a historic disaster.

But its alarming power goes even further, all but ensuring that death and mourning happen in isolation — a trauma in which everybody must keep to themselves.

All across Bergamo, people are being picked up in ambulances, rushed to the hospital and dying in sealed-off wards where even their closest relatives are not allowed. Many funerals are taking place with only a priest and funeral-home employee present, while family members face restrictions on gathering, remain in quarantine or are too sick themselves.

So many have died that there is a waiting list for burial and cremation.

“I think it’s worse than a war,” said Marta Testa, 43, who is in self-quarantine and whose father died Wednesday of the virus at age 85. “Dad is waiting to be buried. And we are here waiting to tell him goodbye.”

[Live coronavirus updates: U.S. life shuts down; surgeon general warns ‘we could be Italy’]

Other countries are only beginning to grapple with the pandemic’s implications and the distance it forces between even the closest people. But in Italy, death by lonely death, its full cost is becoming apparent.
More than 2,000 people in Italy have died of covid-19, the disease caused by virus — half of them over the most recent five-day stretch — and many of those cases have looked like that of Testa’s father, Renzo, a former newspaper advertising executive who felt short of breath a week ago Saturday, was taken to the hospital and did not see or talk to his family again.

“Grief is a phase that requires closeness, but our grief has had to come via the telephone,” said Testa, whose parents had been married for 50 years and whose mother also appears to have the virus but is recovering.

Testa’s siblings bring food to their mother. Out of precaution, they leave it on her front door.

“Right now,” Testa said, “our family is living in a suspended state.”

Even as the virus has spread around the world, it is in Italy where people are contracting the virus — and dying of it — more rapidly than anywhere else. On Sunday, the country reported 368 new deaths, a toll exceeding even the highest daily figures from China. By Monday, 349 died, bringing the total in less than one month to 2,158.

[As coronavirus cases grow, hospitals in northern Italy are running out of beds]

And within Italy, Bergamo, a wealthy province of 1.1 million to the east of Milan, has become the most worrying hot spot. Hospitals are at the breaking point there. Military doctors have been called in to assist. Residents describe Bergamo as a ghostly place where only ambulances and hearses are on the road at night. In the small town of Nembro, according to the Corriere della Sera newspaper, 70 people have died in the past 12 days. Some 120 died all of last year.
“It’s as if a chemical bomb has exploded,” said Daniela Taiocchi, 49, who helps handle obituaries for the local newspaper, L’Eco di Bergamo.

Bergamo also stands as a warning sign about how coronavirus cases can explode if restrictions are not quickly put in place. Italy dealt with an initial hot spot, in the province of Lodi, by placing 10 small towns under lockdown more than three weeks ago. But the government waited far longer to put similar measures in place elsewhere. Bergamo now has three times the number of coronavirus cases as Lodi.

“Morgues and health institutions are collapsing,” said Claudia Scotti, a funeral-home co-owner. “We were absolutely unprepared for an emergency of this kind.”

The people who are dying, memorialized in page after page of the L’Eco di Bergamo, are ex-politicians, electricians, emergency phone operators, priests. Most are in their 70s or 80s. Their short obituaries don’t mention the cause of death but don’t need to — 90 percent, the newspaper’s editor estimated, died because of the coronavirus. Instead, the obituaries have other clues about how much grieving has changed during the emergency. They mention “direct transport to the crematorium.” A public ceremony at a “date to be determined.” A funeral held in a “strictly private form.”

[In coronavirus lockdown, Milan sheds its reputation for aloofness, grows closer — from a distance]

Across the country, funerals inside churches have been put on hold, part of the government’s absolute restriction on gatherings. For families cleared to leave their homes, some in Bergamo have been allowed to meet for small burials at the cemetery, capped at 10 people. But aside from those moments, the city has closed the cemeteries entirely, fearing that residents would take public transportation, visit the graves of those who have died and spread the virus themselves.

The mayor’s office has encouraged the cremation of people who die of covid-19. And on Wednesday, the local crematorium began operating around the clock.

When on one of the usual check-in calls by the govt, she made a slight cough and next thing you know an ambulance was at her house to whip her off to hospital. Also, super importantly, testing and hospitalisation fees of all citizens are covered.

Like many on this forum, this whole episode left me feeling disquietened and unsure what to do. After a discussion with my family and my (awesome) company, I called my old hospital and offered my time. I start later this week working in the emergency department. The department is calm now, but we know what is coming. I was surprised that I felt a great sense of peace descend on me once I’d signed the contract.

I drove home in beautiful weather, the signs on the freeway indicating that all external borders were closed were completely incongruous with the blue sky and stunning, sun-kissed countryside. I called my parents, who are still being a bit reckless in my opinion but are well-informed adults and seem in good spirits and are enjoying each other’s company. I went for my fourth run this week after five years of doing no exercise at all – I want to make sure my heart is in good condition for two weeks on a ventilator if needs be. I’ve been listening to the Clash while running and I’d forgotten how incredible they were. But anyway, it made me think how this whole situation is not all that bad – we can all do our bit to take the fight to this disease, it’s making us spend more time thinking and reflecting and, at least in my case, nudging me to make healthier choices. It reminded me of reading Voltaire’s Candide when I was 15 and the tenacity of optimism in the face of adversity.

I almost certainly won’t die – I’m young and healthy. I may even not get infected – only 20% of Italian physicians did. It will be harrowing, and many, many people will be lost, I am under no illusions, but it is what it is. This clearly isn’t the best of all possible worlds, but it is all we have.

Daniele from Rome, day 8 of Self Isolation.

This has become kind of a diary and one of the things I look forward to in order to pass the time.

Cleaning day today. I divided up the house in three zones and started a deep cleaning of everything. Went out for a minute to throw out the trash. The streets are empty, it looks kinda like the beginning of 28 days later. Only the sparse sound of distant ambulances. I'm starting to accept this situation as a long-term thing, at least a couple of months. I take comfort in the fact that everyone who is self-isolating is doing their part and in their mathematical sense, helping to save lives. It's too early to start talking figures yet, another couple of days at least until this isolation starts to bear results.

I keep reading, most of the day, news and figures and charts. The more I read, the more I'm convinced that we're on the right path. We've taken the brunt of this thing and it must have been rough to ask people to give up so much of their normal living in order to save everyone and, as I've said in the past, I'm mostly proud of how my fellow Italians responded. 

Overall today's growth, +13%, has been the lowest since March 1st and this fill me with hope.

I keep worrying about the US. The numbers are bound to be way way way higher than those provided by the authorities. My country has been quite transparent and has tested well over 100k people. Despite this the actual numbers are reported to be 10-20 times higher.

The latest actual figures on the US based on mathematical models and based on the alleged time of first infection are already close to a million. So please my American friends, don't base your decisions on the given figures and assume that they're way higher. Please get a headstart and self isolate. If you have any questions on the matter please ask me and I'll share my experience on the small things (time management, shopping, stocking, tips on the correct behavior when you go out). Please stay safe. Some parts of the world look up to you for guidance and considering some of the pictures and videos of queues and events and public gatherings that I've seen I have the feeling that you're not taking this thing as seriously as you should. Self isolation works. It's starting to work. You can't pray this thing away or defiantly challenge it. We are burying so many people that there are waiting lists for cremations. We're losing a generation of grandparents and of parents. I would't want to see this happening to anyone else.

Please self-isolate. We can beat this thing but we have to stop thinking as nations and start thinking as humankind. Let's take advice from those who have experience and keep our heads down for a while. Until the storm is over, or at least the worst of it.

Hugs from Rome
Daniele"

White rice, pasta, canned beans, spaghetti sauce, and hamburger / frozen chicken are not that expensive, ultimately.  To feed one person for 30 days takes 2000 calories * 30, or 60k calories.  White rice has about 1600 calories per pound.  Pasta, about the same.  For the price of 19 pounds of rice and 19 pounds of pasta, you can meet your 60k calorie requirement.  Now, yes, it's all carbs, but it's *food*.  You can sub out some of the rice and pasta for beans, canned meat (even if it's just Wolf brand chili), frozen meat (hamburger, chicken, whatever), canned fruit, etc.  

A month of calories is not really as complex as most people think it is.  E.g. Wal Mart was selling a 20lb bag of Great Value rice for about $9.  The cost comes into play when you try to add *variety*."
