I was unaware of this. I always wondered why only a few hundred test kits would be distributed at once.

Roughly 50 million people are under quarantine in China. Thousands of travelers are being screened at airports every day. Armies of disease detectives are knocking on doors around the world in hopes of halting the new coronavirus in its tracks.

Despite all the colossal efforts to contain the virus, scientists are quietly preparing for a grim ‚Äî and increasingly likely ‚Äî outcome: A full-blown global pandemic.

Since the novel virus was isolated in December in the Chinese megacity of Wuhan, the pathogen has reached four continents and infected more than 24,000 people. At least 493 of them have died as a result. With the outbreak continuing to expand, authorities acknowledge that efforts will soon shift from trying to squelch the coronavirus to learning to live with it.

‚ÄúWe‚Äôre proceeding as if things go really sour on us in the coming weeks and months,‚Äù said Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases at the National Institutes of Health. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre working for the worst-case scenario.‚Äù

The World Health Organization raised the stakes last week by declaring a public health emergency of international concern. The Trump administration responded by proclaiming a public health emergency in the United States, restricting incoming flights from China and ordering the country‚Äôs first mandatory quarantine in more than 50 years.

Yet the outbreak shows no signs of slowing down.

Infectious disease experts at Imperial College London have calculated that each person infected with the virus early in the outbreak spread it to 2.6 others, on average. For the sake of comparison, in the early days of the 1918 Spanish flu outbreak, each person who became sick is thought to have infected 1.8 others.

Lab-confirmed cases of coronavirus have increased more than 300-fold in the last three weeks. And while two-thirds of early cases were linked to a single market, that proportion quickly dropped, suggesting human-to-human transmission is widespread. Researchers believe individual epidemics are already self-sustaining in several major Chinese cities, and could appear around the globe in regions where travelers from China arrived before showing any symptoms of illness.

‚ÄúContainment is an increasingly remote possibility,‚Äù said Dr. Richard Hatchett, chief executive of the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations, or CEPI, which is coordinating work on a vaccine for 2019-nCoV. ‚ÄúThis is not a China problem. It‚Äôs a global problem.‚Äù

And although the overwhelming majority of those infected so far have recovered, it‚Äôs certainly possible that the virus could become more dangerous.

‚ÄúThe nightmare scenario here is if it mutates into a highly pathogenic strain,‚Äù said Lawrence Gostin, director of the World Health Organization Collaborating Center on National and Global Health Law. ‚ÄúThese kinds of viruses are very adaptable and can swap genes to become much more lethal. We can‚Äôt be complacent.‚Äù

Health officials aren‚Äôt waiting around to see if that will happen. Their preparations for sustained global spread of the coronavirus are already underway.

For starters, doctors and epidemiologists will need reliable, rapid diagnostic tests that can distinguish between people who have influenza or pneumonia and those who are infected with the new virus. That would help ensure patients get the appropriate treatment and allow health officials to map the outbreak accurately.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has already created a test based on the coronavirus genome shared by Chinese scientists and used it to confirm the 11 cases in the U.S., said Dr. Nancy Messonnier, director of the agency‚Äôs National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases.


But in a pandemic scenario, that test won‚Äôt cut it. Doctors will need a faster, simpler tool that‚Äôs as easy to use as a pregnancy test or a rapid strep test. Otherwise they‚Äôll struggle to keep up with the throngs of people who could turn up in emergency rooms and medical clinics with pneumonia-like symptoms. So far, no companies appear to be working on such a test for 2019-nCoV.


Doctors would also need easy access to medicines that can treat the novel coronavirus. Physicians on the front lines have been testing several antiviral drugs that are used for diseases like HIV and Ebola, and researchers are tracking their effectiveness.

Scientists at Northwestern University are examining the protein structure of the coronavirus itself, looking for vulnerable places where existing drugs might be able to latch on and halt its replication inside human cells.

NIH researchers will try to design monoclonal antibody drugs that can target the new virus, Fauci said. They‚Äôll also test whether similar drugs developed to fight the SARS coronavirus have any potency against the new strain, he said.

A formal clinical trial would be necessary to establish a drug‚Äôs efficacy. That could take years, so in the meantime, doctors would probably fill the gap by sharing their successes and failures in meetings, conference calls and preliminary reports in medical journals.

Demand for a coronavirus vaccine would ratchet up if containment is no longer possible. But experts say that even on the fast track, it would take at least a year to develop one, manufacture it in large quantities, and distribute it around the world.

At the NIH‚Äôs Vaccine Research Center, scientists are working with biotechnology company Moderna Inc. to design a vaccine based on a protein found on the coronavirus‚Äô surface. Fauci said a Phase 1 trial could begin within three months to see whether it elicits an immune response. ‚ÄúThat would be rocket speed,‚Äù he said.

CEPI, based in Oslo, has asked its partners to take what they‚Äôve learned creating vaccines for the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus and use it to fight the novel virus.

Pharmaceutical innovations are only part of the story. Hospitals will need larger inventories of patient masks, protective suits for doctors and nurses, and spaces to quarantine patients suspected of being infected, according to a CDC checklist. They‚Äôll also need to review their isolation protocols to prevent the virus from spreading to healthcare workers, other patients or visitors.

The emergency response arm of the Department of Health and Human Services is assessing the inventory of the Strategic National Stockpile, an $8-billion portfolio of drugs and medical supplies that can be tapped in the event of a severe crisis. The stockpile is housed in warehouses across the country ‚Äî their exact locations and contents are kept confidential for national security reasons ‚Äî and it‚Äôs continuously refreshed as products expire and equipment goes out of date.

If the pandemic threshold is crossed, the World Health Organization would need to begin operating as ‚Äî or enlist ‚Äî a logistics company to coordinate a global stockpile system. Dozens of countries would all need the same medicines and equipment at the same time, and that increase in demand could quickly outpace the available supply. Under such circumstances, ensuring that resources make their way from wealthy countries to vulnerable ones is a major challenge.


Another arena in which global officials will undoubtedly spar: international travel and trade. When the WHO declared a global health emergency, officials emphasized that there was no cause for placing limits on either.

Groups like the International Air Transport Assn. and the World Trade Organization are currently examining how best to halt the virus‚Äô spread while avoiding ‚Äúunnecessary restrictions on international traffic‚Äù that could snarl supply chains and bring factory production lines to a screeching halt.

‚ÄúIt would be one thing to suffer through a pandemic, but another to deal with potential shortages and major economic fallout coming from prolonged trade interruptions,‚Äù said Dr. Tom Inglesby, director of the Center for Health Security at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. ‚ÄúThat would inadvertently hurt ourselves further.‚Äù"

Based on the rapid spread of this virus and the likely numbers of infected being modeled by multiple Scientists and Researchers throughout the world, I fear that the chance this virus was spread from a single contaminated animal, dead or alive, directly to humans to be unlikely. My theory is that this virus may have jumped from Bats to Rats within the Wuhan Wet market or elsewhere, and the wild rat population has been spreading the virus along with H2H transmission since the initial infection event occurred. Rats are a major problem in Chinese cities as well as in rural areas, and the un-sanitized Wet Markets are no exception. Wet Markets also present an environment in which viruses can jump cross-species fairly easily due to the mixing of blood, urine and feces on the floor of the markets, and in the drainage systems, which are likely frequented by rats looking for an easy meal.

The following study was undertaken in 2018 using 2 samples of SARS like Coronavirus that were taken in 2015 and 2017 from Bats by the Institute of Military Medicine Nanjing Command, Nanjing. In this study, researchers infected rats with tissue samples that tested positive for the virus. The study illustrated that the virus was capable of replicating in rats and spreading between them through coughing, urine and fecal spread. The virus was noticeably prevalent in the brain tissue and lungs of these rats, who showed symptoms such as lethargy, depression, fatigue and pnuemonia-like respiratory symptoms.

The main takeaway from the study is that. **""These results indicated that the virus can circulate and proliferate in infected rats""**

[https://www.researchgate.net/publication/327594906\_Genomic\_characterization\_and\_infectivity\_of\_a\_novel\_SARS-like\_coronavirus\_in\_Chinese\_bats](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/327594906_Genomic_characterization_and_infectivity_of_a_novel_SARS-like_coronavirus_in_Chinese_bats)

Going back to the 2 samples that were taken in 2015 and 2017, The following shows that the 2 samples share an identical protein group for an envelope protein with the Wuhan strain of the coronavirus. After Blasting the new Wuhan strain (analyzing for shared genetic sequences) these two sample strains shared 94% and 95% query coverage along with 89% and 88% percent identity to the new Wuhan strain of the virus. The identical envelope protein suggests that the samples taken in 2015/2017 are predecessors to the current Wuhan strain.

**Query Cover:** The query cover is a number that describes how much of the query sequence is covered by the target sequence. If the target sequence in the database spans the whole query sequence, then the query cover is 100%. This tells us how long the sequences are, relative to each other.

**Percent Identity**: The percent identity is a number that describes how similar the query sequence is to the target sequence (how many characters in each sequence are identical). The higher the percent identity is, the more significant the match.

[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/ipg/QHD43418.1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/ipg/QHD43418.1)

An interesting difference between the 2015/2017 Bat samples and the Wuhan strain is a significantly longer Poly(A) tail in the Wuhan strain. Based on numerous studies from 2001 onward, the significance of Poly(A) tail length is somehow related to the ability of the virus to replicate in host cells. This might help explain how this strain of the virus is so easily spread.

""One potential function of regulated poly(A) tail length might be that for the coronavirus genome a longer poly(A) favors translation."" [Wu HY, Ke TY, Liao WY, Chang NY. Regulation of coronaviral poly(A) tail length during infection. PLoS One. 2013;8(7):e70548. Published 2013 Jul 29. doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0070548](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3726627/)

**What does this mean?** If rats are indeed spreading this virus among one another as well as to humans, the current measures for containment are not sufficient to stop the spread of the virus. Rats can travel into apartment buildings, up stairs and into the homes of unsuspecting people. The likelihood of rats moving into people's homes searching for food is increased now because of the shutdown of wet markets and the lack of people in the streets dropping trash/uneaten food/ etc.

The following article from late 2018 details the issue of rat infestations in Kowloon, Hong Kong and how ""a 56-year-old man living there became the first human worldwide to contract the rat Hepatitis E virus"". Once thought to only affect animals such as rats, the Hepatitus E virus is ‚Äúhighly divergent‚Äù from the strain that affects people. Researchers from the University of Hong Kong who studied the man‚Äôs case said they could not definitively say how the man contracted the virus, but ventured that food he ate had been contaminated by rat feces.

A neighbor of the man infected, ‚ÄúThe rats walk up the staircases,‚Äù the 70-year-old said, looking unperturbed. He said he had placed a board across his front door to prevent the creatures from crawling into his home.""

As a point of reference, back in 1981, the doctor who first notified the CDC about AIDS did so on the basis of *three* suspicious pneumonias. (There were a handful of other cases in NY at the time, but this was one doctor, in Los Angeles, with no particular reason to be concerned about pneumonia, in an age before emails and when the MMWR was literally mailed out to people). 

Also, when a patient presents with a pneumonia that doesn't respond to normal antibiotics, it's normal to get a sample so you can figure out what medicine to use. If *one* patient showed up in a hospital this week or last with a pneumonia that was unidentified or anywhere in the coronavirus family, I guarantee you the CDC is getting a call. 

Might there be a handful of non-severe cases walking around and it managing to fly under the radar of on-guard public health officials? Absolutely. Might be there be hundreds? No. There's are not."

There's a few ways flu can end up being lethal to a healthy adult, but the biggest risk is probably pneumonia.  The effects of pneumonia can usually be allayed by giving the patient oxygen and the lung infection can usually be addressed with antibiotics.  

However, the thing that has people worried is the virus spreading so rapidly that hospitals become overwhelmed.  If 2000 people in Madison get Coronavirus and say 100 of them develop pneumonia then hospitals can cope.  If 200,000 people in Madison get Coronavirus and 10,000 people need to be treated for pneumonia the hospital might be unable to provide care to everyone that needs it.  If medical resources were to become overwhelmed you would see that 1-3% mortality rate spike.  

Right now, it's still not completely understood just how contagious Coronavirus is or just how deadly.  But anytime something is as contagious as this flu shows up people are right to be concerned.

The CDC finally admitted that they believe this yesterday.  So many thousands of people flew in unscreened from Wuhan and China in the last 3 weeks. The CDC and states are not even tracking the infected among those thousands of people. We see the virus spreading through many countries now, and the US is just a bit behind so only now are the number of cases here increasing a lot.    

https://www.cnn.com/2020/02/04/health/coronavirus-slow-strategy-cdc/index.html  

If you are looking at the confirmed cases number, and think that is the only people here who have the virus, that is not correct. There are cases of infected people the CDC and states do not know about - people they let fly to the US from China.     

Will it spread everywhere and and get very bad in the US? Hopefully not. No one knows how much it will spread here. But the CDC, experts, medical professionals and hospitals are expecting many people throughout the US to get this virus.  You can see the this happening in other countries like Japan.  The virus is spreading in those countries and officials there are expecting many people to be infected. Experts here also expect many US cases.      

Despite the current views of experts, many Americans think the US will be able to limit how many people have it here.  The current view of top CDC officials is that we cannot stop it spreading here in the US and there will be many cases here. It looks like we will have hundreds infected here and maybe much more than that.    

I wanted to make this comment because (understandably) many people here seem to think the US can limit the number of cases to a very small number. But now CDC officials and other experts are saying they expect the virus to spread here and it is too late to stop it or catch all cases of infected travelers.   

Note: this doesn't mean that we won't be able to handle the virus in the US, or that it will be in any way as bad as in China."

With SARS, it was mostly spread in hospital settings, which was also true of MERS.  2019-nCoV appears to spread in a more flu-like pattern, rather than a coronavirus-like pattern, which is concerning.

Is 2019-nCoV crazy transmissible like measles?  No.  Thank god, no.  Is it more transmissible than SARS?  Almost certainly yes.

The low rate of transmission in other countries is likely due to awareness and isolation procedures, which does bode well for hopefully containing this."

I work in health care and we've been run through 10 million protocols of what to do if someone is in a waiting room, do we need to warn everyone who came in or just the people next to them or just the doctor and receptionist etc. Hell even in pathology labs, the few that are performing the test can't even do testing under normal circumstances. They need to be in an isolated private room just to run some swabs. 

I don't have a customer facing role but I can imagine the staff being concerned about a duty they had to perform in such a close proximity to someone for an extended period. As a manager I would also empathize for these workers and want to help take steps which will keep them safe and happy. 

It's not something that's going to last forever and makeup being done with testers freaks me out to begin with. They cancelled but gave you advanced notice, an apology and presumably a refund. It seems that they've done all they could to mitigate the damage but I'm sorry it's put a hiccup in your birthday plans."

To disagree?

But I think if you reframe the issue to be about actual meaningful change, improvements to your community and so on, then I think people can understand what we mean by democracy better. Sure, you can vote for your representatives every 2 years and the president every 4, but how long has it been since these people actually cared about you? How long has it been since they actually helped you, your family, your town? Medicare for All and a $15 minimum wage have been popular movements going on for ages and the government never has the time to get around to them, but the moment imperialists need to plunder a foreign land both Dems and Republicans will find the time in their busy schedules to line up and sign the check.

Meanwhile, in China, they might only have 1 party in power, but that party changes its policies to meet the needs of the people. They've lifted 800+ million out of poverty in less than 40 years. When the coronavirus broke out, they built new hospitals in less than 2 weeks. They forced drug companies to sell medicine at lower prices at the start of this year. They focus on the wellbeing of their people and when they do come out on the international stage, it's to give aid to the global south to build infrastructure and move away from the predatory IMF & WorldBank. Irrespective of if China is socialist or revisionist, they are more democratic than we are in the global north. We can only dream of ending poverty, cutting medical costs, and having our taxes not go to funding forever wars abroad. But since we can pick what flavor of imperialist we want, somehow we're more free than they are."

That's false.

You're using race as a proxy for who is more likely to have been in contact with someone that has been infected.

Who's more likely to do that? People that are actually from China and not just of Chinese descent and people that come in contact with them (it's ironic, there is a rift between mainland Chinese and Chinese diaspora, but then racists wouldn't know about that) , business people, university students, etc. That is anyone that goes to areas where someone that has been to Wuhan or secondary contacts.

Saying ‚Äòbetter safe than sorry‚Äô, health minister confirms Canadian girl under HKL watch for suspected coronavirus

Ôøº

ÔøºÔøºDatuk Seri Dzulkefly Ahmad said a visiting 17-year-old Canadian girl has been sent to Kuala Lumpur Hospital for medical observation for possible infection of the 2019-nCoV coronavirus. ‚Äî Picture by Choo Choy May
PUTRAJAYA, Feb 5 ‚Äî A visiting 17-year-old Canadian girl has been sent to Kuala Lumpur Hospital (HKL) for medical observation for possible infection of the 2019-nCoV coronavirus, Datuk Seri Dzulkefly Ahmad confirmed today.

The health minister said the teen was taken to the hospital after she collapsed at the Kuala Lumpur City Centre (KLCC) earlier today and the authorities were just taking extra precaution to ensure that she is not infected by the novel coronavirus that first broke out in China and has since spread to several cities worldwide.

The girl arrived in Malaysia yesterday from Indonesia. Prior to that, she had resided for 15 years in Shanghai, China.

1. FDA expedited approval for the coronavirus testing assay to about 100 approved facilities across the US.  This means the daily capacity & also turn-around times (due to not having to mail all samples to CDC headquarters in Atlanta) is about to increase significantly starting early next week.  Source:   [https://www.nydailynews.com/news/national/ny-coronavirus-outbreak-cdc-sending-test-kits-to-over-a-hundred-labs-20200205-fnwz646sozdd3m3rsxbp6uejcu-story.html](https://www.nydailynews.com/news/national/ny-coronavirus-outbreak-cdc-sending-test-kits-to-over-a-hundred-labs-20200205-fnwz646sozdd3m3rsxbp6uejcu-story.html)
2. CDC screening criterion for getting formally tested for coronavirus 2019 (Patients Under Investigation, or ""PUI"") has expanded as of February 2nd.  Previously, the geographical criteria was *""History of travel from* ***Hubei Province*** *within 14 days of symptom onset.""* Now, that has expanded to, ""History of travel from **mainland China** within 14 days of symptom onset.""  Source:   [https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-nCoV/hcp/clinical-criteria.html#criteria-evaluation-pui](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-nCoV/hcp/clinical-criteria.html#criteria-evaluation-pui)

&#x200B;

Bottom line is, there is a good chance we will see major increases in confirmed case numbers due to a massive increase in both testing capacity and in the number of actual samples being submitted for testing.   Therefore, even if in the next 10 days there isn't a single new case of coronavirus ACTUALLY contracted within the United States (unlikely, but best case scenario), the overall numbers will likely go up simply because they'll be doing a better job of detecting/confirming the cases that already exist.  As other countries expand their capacity to conduct screening tests with these assays, I suspect a similar dynamic will happen with those countries too.  


So unless we all get insanely lucky, it's a matter of WHEN (not  if) the numbers of confirmed cases  in several other countries including the US will skyrocket.  The key at that point will be to figure out--is the spike in confirmed cases mostly just countries doing a better job of identifying previously existing cases, or is it largely a function of the cases becoming truly self-sustaining epidemics locally?  Unfortunately, only time will tell.  Once the major confirmation spikes happen, if the growth largely flatlines, then we can assume the spikes were mostly due to just ""onboarding"" prior existing cases.  But if after another 7-10 days the spike continues to grow at a fairly rapid clip, then it suggests that local containment of the virus may be failing."

MORGANTOWN, W.Va. ‚Äì During the weekly Monongalia Co. Commission meeting Dr. Lee B. Smith, the Monongalia County Health Department (MCHD) executive director, and the county health officer, said there were four people in the state, including Morgantown, who have recently visited China and are now in a self-imposed quarantine to monitor for symptoms of coronavirus.
Dr. Smith said two people in Wheeling who recently visited China for the Chinese New Year are self-quarantining. This means that they are sequestering themselves from the public, by remaining in their homes, for 14 days, the recommended time the Center for Disease Control and Prevention recommends to see if you truly have the disease and to prevent the risk of it spreading to others.
There are two people in Morgantown, who are also in self-quarantine, with a third individual expected to return from China soon and go into quarantine. One is a West Virginia University student, the other a chemical engineer and one works at the WVU School of Public Health. Dr. Smith said the individuals are in contact with WVU Medicine, which is making sure that they are properly monitored.
These are precautionary cases, they have not been confirmed, Dr. Smith said. This is the procedure recommended for anyone returning from China at this time. You can learn more about coronavirus from WBOY‚Äôs¬†previous coverage."

Chinese person living in anywhere that's not China? No, they are not more likely to be in contact with someone from Wuhan. Being genetically considered Chinese doesn't increase your chances of having the virus.

Being IN CHINA makes you more likely to have the disease, not being Chinese. This is just casual racism. What a terrible question to guise ignorance.

There are legitimate environmental reasons for retrieving your dog's waste.  It's not cringy.

Interpretation of pneumonia diagnosis and treatment plan for new coronavirus infection (trial version 5)


Published: 2020-02-05Source : Medical Administration and Hospital Authority

„ÄÄ„ÄÄOn February 5, 2020, the National Health and Health Commission issued the ""Diagnosis and Treatment Plan for New Coronavirus Infected Pneumonia (Trial Fifth Edition)"" (hereinafter referred to as the ""Fifth Edition of the Diagnosis and Treatment Plan""). The main contents are now read as follows.

„ÄÄ„ÄÄDecember 2019 Since then, Wuhan City, Hubei Province has successively found multiple cases of patients with pneumonitis infected by a new type of coronavirus. With the spread of the epidemic, other cases have been found in other regions of China and abroad. Most of the currently reported cases have a history of Wuhan residence or travel In some areas, no cases of travel history in Wuhan have been found. The disease has been included in the Class B infectious diseases stipulated in the Law of the People's Republic of China on the Prevention and Control of Infectious Diseases, and measures for the prevention and control of Class A infectious diseases have been taken. After the

„ÄÄ„ÄÄoutbreak, Relevant experts organized by the National Health and Health Committee have formulated the trial, trial second edition, trial third edition, and trial fourth edition of the New Coronavirus Infected Pneumonia Diagnosis and Treatment Plan. The

„ÄÄ„ÄÄfifth edition of the trial includes the pathogenic and clinical characteristics of coronavirus . , Case definition, differential diagnosis, case discovery and reporting, treatment, release and isolation criteria, referral The principles of transport and hospital infection control.

„ÄÄ„ÄÄFirst, the pathogenic characteristics of the coronavirus introduced the subfamily of coronavirus into four genera: Œ±, Œ≤, Œ≥, and Œ¥. In addition to the newly discovered coronavirus, it is known to infect people. There are 7 types of coronaviruses. Most coronaviruses cause upper respiratory tract infections, and the Middle East respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus, and this new type of coronavirus can cause pneumonia, even severe pneumonia, and can It is transmitted from person to person.

„ÄÄ„ÄÄCoronavirus is sensitive to ultraviolet rays and heat. Most disinfectants can effectively inactivate the virus, but chlorhexidine cannot effectively inactivate the virus. Hand disinfectants containing chlorhexidine should be avoided.

„ÄÄ„ÄÄSecond, epidemics The source of infection was changed to ""The source of infection currently seen is mainly patients with new coronavirus infection. Asymptomatic infection may also become the source of infection.""

„ÄÄ„ÄÄThird, clinical manifestations. The incubation period is 1-14 days, usually 3-7 days. Main symptoms are fever, fatigue, and dry cough. A few patients have symptoms such as nasal congestion, runny nose, and diarrhea. Because some severely ill patients had no obvious dyspnea and manifested as hypoxemia, it changed to ""Severely ill patients often have dyspnea and / or hypoxemia one week after the onset of illness, and the severe cases progress rapidly to acute respiratory distress syndrome, sepsis Symptomatic shock, difficult to correct metabolic acidosis, and coagulation dysfunction, etc. ""emphasized that"" light patients only showed low fever, mild fatigue, etc., and no pneumonia. ""

„ÄÄ„ÄÄLaboratory tests increased"" Some patients may appear liver enzymes, LDH, Myoenzyme and myoglobin increased; troponin increased in some critically ill patients. ""And"" New coronavirus nucleic acids can be detected in nasopharyngeal swabs, sputum, lower respiratory secretions, blood, feces and other specimens. ""

„ÄÄ„ÄÄChest imaging Multiple small patchy shadows and interstitial changes appeared early, and the extrapulmonary bands were obvious. Furthermore, it develops multiple ground glass infiltration and infiltrates in both lungs. In severe cases, pulmonary consolidation and pleural effusion are rare.

„ÄÄ„ÄÄFourth, case diagnosis is treated differently between Hubei Province and other provinces outside Hubei Province.

„ÄÄ„ÄÄOther provinces outside Hubei are still divided into ""suspected cases"" and ""confirmed cases"". Based on confirmed cases that have been found to have no clear epidemiological history, ""those with no clear epidemiological history are in line with 3 clinical manifestations (fever and / or respiratory symptoms; with the above-mentioned characteristics of pneumonia imaging; total white blood cells in the early stages of onset) Normal or decreased, or lymphocyte count decreased.) ""Suspected cases were also included for investigation. The diagnostic criteria for confirmed cases have not changed (requires real-time fluorescent RT-PCR for respiratory or blood specimens to detect positive new-type coronavirus nucleic acid; or viral gene sequencing, which is highly homologous with known new coronaviruses.)

„ÄÄ„ÄÄHubei Province added ""clinical diagnosis ""classification. And the ""suspected case"" standard is modified to: whether with or without epidemiological history, as long as it meets the two clinical manifestations of ""fever and / or respiratory symptoms"" and ""normal or reduced white blood cells in the early stage of onset, or decreased lymphocyte count"", then Can be considered a suspected case. This is equivalent to the relaxation of suspected cases. Suspected cases with pneumonia imaging features are clinically diagnosed cases. The diagnostic criteria for confirmed cases have not changed.

„ÄÄ„ÄÄFifth, clinical typing. According to whether there are clinical symptoms, whether there is pneumonia, the severity of pneumonia, whether there is respiratory failure, shock, whether there is other organ failure, etc., it is divided into mild (clinical symptoms, no pneumonia on radiology); ordinary (fever, Respiratory symptoms such as pneumonia on imaging studies); severe (respiratory distress, RR‚â•30 beats / min; resting state, oxygen saturation ‚â§93%; arterial blood oxygen pressure (PaO¬†2¬†) / oxygen concentration ( FiO¬†2¬†) ‚â§ 300mmHg) and critically severe (respiratory failure occurs and requires mechanical ventilation; shock occurs; combined with other organ failure requires ICU monitoring and treatment.)

„ÄÄ„ÄÄSixth, differential diagnosis. There are more than 100 species of pathogens that cause community-acquired pneumonia, of which viruses account for about 30%, and pneumonia caused by other viruses and common influenza viruses, parainfluenza viruses, adenoviruses, respiratory syncytial virus, rhinoviruses, human metapneumoviruses Viruses, SARS coronaviruses, etc. have similarities. It is difficult to distinguish from clinical manifestations and chest imaging alone, and they need to be distinguished by pathogenic testing.

„ÄÄ„ÄÄSeventh, case detection, reporting and exclusion. Hubei Province is different from other provinces outside Hubei.

„ÄÄ„ÄÄIn other provinces outside Hubei, the case detection was the same as the defendant's procedure and the fourth edition. There was no change in the case. It was stressed that the transfer should ensure that the suspected patient was transferred to the designated hospital as soon as possible under the premise of ensuring the safety of the transfer.

„ÄÄ„ÄÄFor Hubei Province, medical staff at all levels and types of medical institutions are required to immediately isolate and treat suspected and clinically diagnosed cases that meet the definition of the case. Suspected and clinically diagnosed cases should be isolated in a single room. Suspected and clinically diagnosed cases should be isolated. Specimens should be collected for pathogenic testing as soon as possible.

„ÄÄ„ÄÄSuspected cases should be tested negative for two consecutive consecutive respiratory pathogenic nucleic acid tests (sampling interval of at least 1 day).

„ÄÄ„ÄÄEighth, treatment includes isolation, symptomatic support, and close monitoring of changes in the condition, especially respiratory rate, finger saturation, etc.

Suspected cases should be treated in isolation in a single room, and confirmed cases can be admitted to the same ward.

„ÄÄ„ÄÄCritical cases should be admitted to ICU as soon as possible.

„ÄÄ„ÄÄAntibacterial use: Avoid blind or inappropriate use of antibacterials, especially the combination of broad-spectrum antibacterials.

„ÄÄ„ÄÄAntiviral treatment: Add ""No effective antiviral treatment is currently confirmed."" On the basis of alpha-interferon nebulization inhalation, lopinavir / ritonavir may be added, ""or ribavirin may be added "". At the same time, pay attention to adverse reactions related to lopinavir / ritonavir, diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, liver damage, and interaction with other drugs.

„ÄÄ„ÄÄSuccessful treatment of severe and critical cases is the key to reducing mortality. It is necessary to actively prevent complications, treat underlying diseases, prevent secondary infections, and provide organ function support in a timely manner. Patients often have anxiety and fear, and psychological counseling should be strengthened.

Condition monitoring, adding ""conditionally feasible cytokine testing.""

„ÄÄ„ÄÄRespiratory support: (1) Oxygen therapy: Severe patients should receive nasal cannula or mask to inhale oxygen, and timely evaluate whether respiratory distress and / or hypoxemia is relieved . (2) High-flow nasal catheter oxygen therapy or non-invasive mechanical ventilation: When patients with respiratory distress and / or hypoxemia cannot be relieved after receiving standard oxygen therapy, high-flow nasal catheter oxygen therapy or non-invasive ventilation can be considered. Emphasis ""if the condition does not improve or worsen within a short period of time (1-2 hours), tracheal intubation and invasive mechanical ventilation should be performed in a timely manner."" (3) Invasive mechanical ventilation: lung protective ventilation strategy, that is, small tidal volume ( 4-8ml / kg ideal body weight) and low inspiratory pressure (platform pressure <30cmH¬†2"

>First, the medical staff at the medical facility where the person was being treated are required to disinfect and seal the remains. It is forbidden to open the remains once they have been sealed. Second, the medical staff will issue a death certificate and notify the family. At this point, the local funeral services facility will be contacted. Third, funeral services personnel will then collect the body, deliver it to the relevant facility, and directly cremate the remains. A cremation certificate will then be issued.

They had to build a gargantuan glorified triage center in 10 days because they completely failed to acknowledge this crisis and their response has been 99% about protecting China's reputation and 1% about actually solving the issue. 

China is not transparent. I can't believe anyone would even suggest that. They don't have watchdogs, they don't have whistle blowers, you cannot sue or criticize the government, hell you can't even tell the world what you are seeing if it is different than what China wants others to believe! They have endangered the entire world population by downplaying this crisis and deflating infected numbers because they care more about their image and their power than humanity. They are an authoritarian regime which censors their people and jails/murders dissidents. They don't admit their mistakes and learn from them and this coronavirus outbreak is literal proof of that considering how little has changed since SARS. 

The USA is deeply flawed but we are ABSOLUTELY, UNEQUIVOCALLY better about humanely operating a government. We have a Congress that can override the president. We have property ownership and due process. The government has to pay market value for things and perform due diligence and environmental review, they have to use union contractors. The massive amounts of additional hoops our government has to go through to build something is due to rules and regulations that protect and benefit the PEOPLE. The fact that the government can't instantly build what they want how they want it regardless of the community is a BENEFIT. You may enjoy life in North Korea if you honestly disagree with that."

And usually the longer a virus exist, the easier it is for humans to fight it (both because of better antibodies in our blood, also because usually the virus weakens with each mutation)

The results would be the flu ""looks"" way worse, and coronavirus looks harmless. If we manage to stop the spread, that would be true.

But the purpose of the chart is to show exactly that, can we stop it, or will it keep going, to eventually outpace the seasonal flu?

A note for everyone that thinks the coronavirus is way overblown, it \*is\* incredibly infections, way higher than the flu currently, and it also have a way higher fatality rate (the seasonal flu is usually around 0.2%, while coronavirus, at the absolutley most optimistic view, around 1%, but I have seen anything between 1% and 11%)

According to Clar√≠n confirmed from the Buenos Aires government, he had arrived on guard on Wednesday with febrile syndrome, headache, myalgias and throat discomfort 48 hours evolution.

 ""It is isolated, they are doing the studies,"" they said from the health center, and warned that only cases of extreme urgency are treated in the guard.  At the gates of Chivilcoy and New York streets, strict income control was carried out and most of the doctors and employees worked with chinstrap.

 As Clar√≠n learned, the young man works in a legal study that receives Chinese citizens, often derived from that country's embassy.

 ""The probability of coronavirus is very low,"" official sources said.  The doctors planned to discharge him in the next few hours, but the patient should continue in permanent contact with the hospital infectologist.

 The analyzes that were carried out now go to Mu√±iz where the different types of influenza will be analyzed by protocol.  Depending on the results, the sample could go to Malbr√°n where the definitive diagnosis is made on the possibility that it is a case of coronavirus.

 The case activated the protocol provided for this type of situation.  This was the first in the area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe City of Buenos Aires.  Those who had a shift or demanded care by guard could enter the hospital.  Inside, they said, they were struck to see a large number of doctors, guards and employees with chinstrap.

 A 23-year-old boy - who did not want to give his name - said that he wanted to go in and leave something to a relative who is hospitalized and did not let him pass.  They told him that there is a possible case of coronavirus and asked him to take it with him.

 Another 70-year-old lady came to the hospital guard to treat herself for an allergic skin reaction.  When he was admitted, the doctor told him that ""he was in a hurry because there seemed to be a case of coronavirus.""  He said he recommended that he leave the hospital quickly.  In total it was an hour.

 Paola (43) has been going to Zubizarreta for 4 months every day to visit her brother who is hospitalized.  This Wednesday he noticed that security had been reinforced, ""but you can pass normally and they don't ask you anything.""  She could go up to see him.  Inside the hospital, the comment was that there was a man in the guard under observation and that the doctors ""are all chinstrapped""

Beyond the chinstraps and controls, the day passed with some normality.  Except for an incident that was recorded at about 17. A group of parents of boys who had entered the guard had learned through the media that there was an alleged case of coronavirus and claimed that security employees had not notified them.  before entering  After the discussion, troops from the City Police arrived, and the situation calmed down.

 At the end of January, health authorities launched emergency measures to prevent the entry of any potential case.  The Ministry of Health of the province of Buenos Aires, for example, raised its alert levels and set up a series of specialized centers to quickly detect any suspicious situation arising from this disease.  The hospitals that activated their specialized protocols for these situations are the Alberto Eurnekian General Acute Zone of Ezeiza, due to its proximity to the International Airport, and the Antonio Cetr√°ngolo of Vicente L√≥pez.

 In the last hours a similar situation occurred in Posadas, Misiones, with a woman who arrived at the hospital of Fatima due to a flu and a feverish picture and the emergency protocol was activated because she had arrived from the United States.

 She was kept isolated and conducted studies that finally ruled out that it is the virus that already caused 490 deaths in China.  This was confirmed by the missionary governor, Oscar Herrera Ahuad.

""Missions complies with the national epidemiological alert protocol, an extremely sensitive system and in case of patients with symptoms the procedure is activated. It is completely ruled out that it is a coronavirus after studies,"" explained Herrera Ahuad.

 She was a 25-year-old woman who lives in Garup√° and had traveled to Boston."

The World Health Organization raised the stakes last week by [declaring a public health emergency of international concern](https://www.latimes.com/science/story/2020-01-30/who-says-china-coronavirus-outbreak-is-public-health-emergency). The Trump administration responded by [proclaiming a public health emergency](https://www.latimes.com/world-nation/story/2020-01-31/white-house-orders-health-emergency-over-coronavirus) in the United States, restricting incoming flights from China and ordering [the country‚Äôs first mandatory quarantine](https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2020-01-31/all-195-americans-who-fled-coronavirus-in-china-under-quarantine-at-california-base) in more than 50 years.

Yet the outbreak shows no signs of slowing down.

Infectious disease experts at Imperial College London have [calculated](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/media/imperial-college/medicine/sph/ide/gida-fellowships/Imperial-2019-nCoV-transmissibility.pdf) that each person infected with the virus early in the outbreak spread it to 2.6 others, on average. For the sake of comparison, in the early days of the 1918 Spanish flu outbreak, each person who became sick is thought to have [infected](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17517812) 1.8 others.

Lab-confirmed cases of coronavirus have increased more than 300-fold in the last three weeks. And while two-thirds of early cases were linked to a single market, that proportion quickly [dropped](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2001316), suggesting human-to-human transmission is widespread. Researchers believe individual epidemics are already [self-sustaining](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(20)30260-9/fulltext) in several major Chinese cities, and could appear around the globe in regions where travelers from China arrived before showing any symptoms of illness.

‚ÄúContainment is an increasingly remote possibility,‚Äù said [Dr. Richard Hatchett](https://cepi.net/news_cepi/cepi-permanent-ceo/), chief executive of the [Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations](https://cepi.net/), or CEPI, which is coordinating work on a vaccine for 2019-nCoV. ‚ÄúThis is not a China problem. It‚Äôs a global problem.‚Äù

And although the overwhelming majority of those infected so far have recovered, it‚Äôs certainly possible that the virus could become more dangerous.

‚ÄúThe nightmare scenario here is if it mutates into a highly pathogenic strain,‚Äù said [Lawrence Gostin](https://oneill.law.georgetown.edu/faculty/Lawrence-Gostin/), director of the World Health Organization Collaborating Center on National and Global Health Law. ‚ÄúThese kinds of viruses are very adaptable and can swap genes to become much more lethal. We can‚Äôt be complacent.‚Äù

Health officials aren‚Äôt waiting around to see if that will happen. Their preparations for sustained global spread of the coronavirus are already underway.  

For starters, doctors and epidemiologists will need reliable, rapid diagnostic tests that can distinguish between people who have influenza or pneumonia and those who are infected with the new virus. That would help ensure patients get the appropriate treatment and allow health officials to map the outbreak accurately.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has already created a test based on the coronavirus genome shared by Chinese scientists and used it to confirm the 11 cases in the U.S., said [Dr. Nancy Messonnier](https://www.cdc.gov/about/leadership/leaders/ncird.html), director of the agency‚Äôs National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases.

But in a pandemic scenario, that test won‚Äôt cut it. Doctors will need a faster, simpler tool that‚Äôs as easy to use as a pregnancy test or a [rapid strep test](https://www.cdc.gov/groupastrep/diseases-public/strep-throat.html). Otherwise they‚Äôll struggle to keep up with the throngs of people who could turn up in emergency rooms and medical clinics with pneumonia-like symptoms. So far, no companies appear to be working on such a test for 2019-nCoV. 

Doctors would also need easy access to medicines that can treat the novel coronavirus. Physicians on the front lines have been testing several antiviral drugs that are used for diseases like HIV and Ebola, and researchers are tracking their effectiveness.

Scientists at Northwestern University are examining the protein structure of the coronavirus itself, looking for vulnerable places where existing drugs might be able to latch on and halt its replication inside human cells.

NIH researchers will try to design monoclonal antibody drugs that can target the new virus, Fauci said. They‚Äôll also test whether similar drugs developed to fight the SARS coronavirus [have any potency against the new strain](https://www.hhs.gov/about/news/2020/02/04/hhs-regeneron-collaborate-to-develop-2019-ncov-treatment.html), he said.

A formal clinical trial would be necessary to establish a drug‚Äôs efficacy. That could take years, so in the meantime, doctors would probably fill the gap by sharing their successes and failures in meetings, conference calls and preliminary reports in medical journals.

Demand for a coronavirus vaccine would ratchet up if containment is no longer possible. But experts say that even on the fast track, it would take at least a year to develop one, manufacture it in large quantities, and distribute it around the world.

At the NIH‚Äôs [Vaccine Research Center](https://www.niaid.nih.gov/about/vrc), scientists are working with biotechnology company Moderna Inc. to design a vaccine based on a protein found on the coronavirus‚Äô surface. Fauci said a Phase 1 trial could begin within three months to see whether it elicits an immune response. ‚ÄúThat would be rocket speed,‚Äù he said.

CEPI, based in Oslo, has asked its partners to [take what they‚Äôve learned](https://cepi.net/news_cepi/cepi-to-fund-three-programmes-to-develop-vaccines-against-the-novel-coronavirus-ncov-2019/) creating vaccines for the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus and use it to fight the novel virus. 

Pharmaceutical innovations are only part of the story. Hospitals will need larger inventories of patient masks, protective suits for doctors and nurses, and spaces to quarantine patients suspected of being infected, according to a [CDC checklist](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/hcp-hospital-checklist.html). They‚Äôll also need to review their isolation protocols to prevent the virus from spreading to healthcare workers, other patients or visitors."

The rise in confirmed cases is limited by the amount of test kits they can test a day (~2k-3k).  Models out of Johns Hopkins estimated 90k cases last week, with a doubling of 6 days, so there could be 180k cases, which is exactly what health experts are suggesting (5x-30x the stated numbers).  China isn't hiding these (well...) it's just they are too busy trying to keep society intact to tally correctly.  

The virus has a 2-14 day incubation period where you are still shedding virus in the lungs and gut.  Then there is 5-7 days of mild flu symptoms.  Then after that, things rapidly decline for 20-25% of those affected, with half of those requiring ICU care (forced oxygen) and ~10% of those hospitalized dying.

The estimated Ro is 2 on the low end and 4 on the high end, either way, highly contagious.  The virus can live on surfaces up to 28 days (average 2-5 though). Even with a mortality rate of 2%, that is 50x more deadly than the flu, but more contagious than a cold.  But, we don't actually have enough statistics to know either the Ro or the mortality rate, so it could be lower or higher.  Which brings us to China.

No one quarantines 50 million people, bring the economy to a halt (100's of billions wiped from the market) for no good reason.  There are armed guards in Wuhan patrolling the streets, people's doors are getting welded shut, they are forcibly removing suspected people from their homes, offering money to rat out your sick neighbors, and there *may* be a 7 year jail time for posting unofficial video.  The videos that are coming out of Wuhan show people suddenly collapsing, and hospitals using waiting rooms to store bodies.  There is circumstantial evidence that the crematoriums are running 24/7.  Oh, also China's only BSL-4 lab (which was actively working on modified coronaviruses) was 10 miles away from the outbreak epicenter (circumstantial, but true).  There are mile long lines for masks in both Wuhan and Hong Kong. I have sources for all of this, don't downvote, just ask.

Now onto the rest of the world.  The CDC issued its first quarantine in 50 years. Russia has closed its borders with China and are quarantining people in Siberia.  Macau closed all of their schools and casinos.  There are mask shortages everywhere, including here (try ordering masks on amazon).  

Viruses don't know boundaries.  The CDC expects this to become a pandemic.  There are already 6 cases in CA alone.  Even at 2%, with such high contagion and a populace doing absolutely nothing to stop its spread, you can expect ~2% of our city to die from this.  That's if the hospitals don't get overwhelmed (they will when 20% of the population needs ICU beds they don't have). 

**TL;DR: Is this the spanish flu? Probably not, but we honestly don't know yet.  But it sure isn't the fucking sniffles.**

Especislly when reviewing studies like The Lancet, specifically the labs. I have chrons' disease, and auto immune disorder effecting the gut. It was actual kind of interesting to me that a large % of the first 99 patients at least appeared to show very similar lab results[both blood and urine panels] that I show myself in the middle of a ""flair up"".  It would not surprise me at all if it turns out even in part that nCov is highly active in the gut microbiome inside a host *even* in those patients that dont manifest diarrhea or vomiting. My theory comes from the fact that only a small % show those specific symptoms while a MUCH higher % exhibit the lab results similar to my own.  

It makes me wonder if thats one of the ways its affecting the immune system specifically as the gut is a huge part of that. I'm not a doctor and these statements absolutely are not backed up by one or even reviewed by one so please take it with a grain of salt- learning about the actual virus is just fascinating to me in a way"

The Spanish Flu had a mortality rate of 2.8% and was devastating the world over, so that totally means the coronavirus is going to kill us all.  After all, it's not like people are going to get better at identifying the symptoms and get treated earlier and more aggressively, thereby heavily reducing the mortality rate.  That's hard coded into the virus, there's an RNG set to kill 5% of the world dontchaknow."

> 
> Treasury is crunching numbers to indicate the full scale of the impact on the economy and the federal budget, from the disease which has so far claimed more than 400 lives worldwide, and resulted in 15 Australians testing positive to the virus.

> On Wednesday, both the ANZ and AMP Capital warned the combined impact of the coronavirus outbreak and the bushfires could see the economy record a negative quarter of growth through the first three months of this year.
> 
> The last time Australia registered a negative quarter was in March 2011 when ports across Queensland and Western Australia were shut down due to cyclone activity.

The noise about measles is very overblown. For 2020 as of January 31, there have been 5 confirmed cases of measles in 5 states and there are no outbreaks of continuous transmission currently in the USA. So just to focus your panic, there have been 11 cases of 2019 Novel Coronavirus this year. By all means, keep track of any local alerts about measles.  Whooping cough (Pertussis) is somewhat more problematic. The acellular pertussis vaccine used in the USA currently does a fair job of preventing the patient from developing symptoms of whooping cough but may fail to stop transmission. So you may what to keep away the '2 year old' if they get a pertussis vaccine. There is a very interesting story behind the switch between whole-cell and acellular pertussis vaccine, and some reconsideration about that decision. Unfortunately, this is not a sub that is very supportive of thoughtful discussion."

Health officials are monitoring another possible case of the coronavirus in the state of Ohio.

Officials with the Ohio Department of Health say they are monitoring a possible case of the novel virus, but didn't mention what part of the state the patient is in.

State health officials said they would not release an exact location, saying only the person under investigation lives in the state.

Samples from the person under investigation were sent to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for testing.

Results are expected in the coming days, health officials said. Authorities said a local health department is working in collaboration with the Ohio Department of Health.

Ohio remains at low risk, health officials said, and there are no confirmed cases in the state.

The news follows a scare at Miami University, where two students were tested for the novel virus after a recent trip to China. Both students tested negative, health officials said Sunday.

The coronavirus has sickened thousands, with the death toll soaring to around 500 globally. The virus mainly sickens animals, but this specific coronavirus ""jumped the species barrier"" to infect people on a large scale, officials with the CDC said.

Despite the coronavirus' impact in China, the CDC maintains that the risk to Americans is low.

Reported illnesses have ranged from infected people with little or no symptoms to death, officials with the CDC said. Symptoms are similar to other respiratory illnesses. These viruses may cause mild to severe respiratory issues with fever, cough and shortness of breath"

Because you should trust him and he trusts the healthcare, you should trust the healthcare. Its for your own good. Other countries have cheaper healthcare because they realized america has the best healthcare. Isnt that how things work? The more expensive it is, the better the quality? Thats why america is actually amazing and revolutionary with its healthcare. If you dont trust america's healthcare, you should go try some out there. Out president has lived outside of america in his whole life, in a city called Perto Rico at the state of New Mexico. The healthcare there is bad. It was actually provided by China. That's right, China provided the healthcare. And when the president listed for the healthcare in China, he gets coronavirus. If you dont trust the president, you'll get coronavirus too.

The overwhelming evidence is elderly, very young, and people with comorbid conditions are the most at risk for dying.  If you want to get even more detailed, they found a very high correlation with the viral pneumonia risk scale and the likelihood of dying from coronavirus.   Diabetes, heart disease, history of smoking, over 60, etc are all strongly associated with severity and death.  

That being said, it is still in the early stages and things could easily look different in a few weeks or months.  But for now, these are the strongest risk factors.  Yes, you will find exceptions.  But that doesn‚Äôt mean a change in the overall pattern."

I've really, really struggled with life in the past few years, especially since having children.  Full disclosure - I have mental illness, anxiety, depression and I've been vulnerable to abusing over the counter medicines in recent years (codeine-based)

Quite apart from my mental and health issues - I struggle being a parent and it's equally stressful on my wife who is home with them each day (then she works weekends).  We've never been so tight with money, never had so little time together and my career is getting more and more demanding and more 'corporate' every year.  

The world itself seems to be quite 'dog eat dog' and 'all on your own'.  Even wealthy nations like mine (Australia) seem to have been pulling up the drawbridge on welfare and social security in recent years as neoliberalism continues its effects.  Governments cut or clamp down on services provided whilst the profits of billionaires and their share of nations wealth continues to climb.

We know so much more about the environment, sustainability and the sheer interconnectedness of things and yet when it comes to it, we're fucking failing.  Take just one aspect, plastics.  Plastics are amazing, so versatile, so useful every day.  Yet we know their production, at almost every stage, produces significant greenhouse gas emissions and of course they are produced mostly from fossil fuels.  Plastics are not well recycled and so much enters our waterways and oceans and now researchers are finding microplastics from the surface waves to the bottom of Mariana Trench and in our own faeces.  Because of all this, you'd sensibly think a first step on the way to tackling climate change and sustainability in general would be a moratorium banning production of any further new, virgin plastics.  But instead, oil and gas companies are spending billions ramping up production of new plants to make much, much more plastics in the years to come.  This is so fucking depressing it makes me sometimes hope that something like the Novel Coronavirus would expand massively and wipe most of us out.  At my most misanthropic I feel like we as a species have so abused our stewardship of this planet that I think we have lost our right to exist.  Then I take a deep breath and focus on my *own* life and my *own* numerous issues and I put that awful thought aside.

TL;DR; life seems to be getting harder and harder with no end in sight, other than the imagined torturously hot Australia of my and my children's future, where summertime means strictly indoor living, where Zoos are not just a place to go to see animals, but to see the *last* of those animals, the final breeding stock, awaiting a time when our planets climate and our rapaciousness drops to safer level."

>Now, the virus has spread to every region in the country, including the far western frontier of Xinjiang and the remote region of Tibet.

>In an interview with CCTV on January 27, Wuhan mayor Zhou Xianwang admitted his government did not disclose information on the coronavirus ""in a timely fashion.""

>He explained that under Chinese law on infectious diseases, the local government first needs to report the outbreak to national health authorities, and then get approval from the State Council before making an announcement.

Seems like a classic case of how centralized authoritarian regimes fail to circulate information efficiently or to act quickly. Everyone's afraid of putting a foot wrong, and the bureaucracy is much better at ignoring the unexpected than it is at reacting to it."

If I take the test with someone who has coronavirus, I'm not concerned I might die, but I will need to be quarantined for two weeks. That means my family will also have to be quarantined for two weeks since I will have been in close contact with them. 

My family owns a small business and that means the shop will be closed for two weeks. = No income for that amount of time. 

If my family gets the virus, shop regulars will also have to be quarantined and that won't help business at all. News spreads like wildfire here in South Korea, so I expect Q1 sales will be dead. That might kill the business.

And I am a Korean worried I might get the virus from Koreans. Xenophobia? Really? Please don't dish out accusations like you know the whole situation.

&#x200B;

I honestly doubt anyone will have the virus, and I'm not concerned that I might die. I know the mortality rate is 2-3%. But business is hard, and I'm worried my actions will put the final nail in the coffin. 

Koreans are very scared and business is hard everywhere in the country right now as people are staying away from crowds. You can't just disregard the socioeconomic impacts, and hundreds of kids gather at this CBT test center in Korea. Even a rumor will impact my life.

So I'd say it's still going, there have been lulls this long throughout last year before sudden escalation. After all the protests have been going on like 9 months, and it's not like every single day stuff was happening during this time, it always kinda come in waves. And yeah even this month had some minor protest action, but there actually wasn't much going on during lunar new year, just various small scale disruptions. But people are tired and now with the coronavirus outbreak news has shifted.

But also there is a medical union striking with a few thousand doctors/nurses, and notably this union was formed very recently, during the protests last year if I remember correctly. While they are protesting against the fact that a full closure of the border has not occurred, they likely won't give the government any slack despite new measures and most of the border being closed as they probably want to put pressure on the government. If the protests weren't going on this strike probably wouldn't be happening.

The flu has a mortality rate of like 0.06% or something, with literally tens of millions of cases.

If  you get the same number of coronavirus cases, even with the current  conservative estimate of 3% mortality, what do you think will happen?  It's clear this is a very contagious virus, too.

We  also understand the flu, have treatments, and are equipped to deal with  the flu.  The flu has a complication rate of 0.1% requiring emergency  care whereas the coronavirus has a higher complication rate ranging from  1% to 10%. We are not equipped to deal with a sudden demand for  emergency that is this huge. An overload in the emergency care system increases mortality. Not just from the virus but from all emergencies. It definitely can affect everyone.

We  also have no herd immunity against the coronavirus and any secondary or  permanent effects it may have is currently unknown because it's a new  virus. It is silly to dismiss it and pretend it is nothing because of a  comparison with the flu."

> TAIPEI - The cruise liner that was quarantined off Yokohama, Japan, on Tuesday made a port of call in Taiwan just days after a passenger infected with the coronavirus disembarked and four days before 10 more were diagnosed with the potentially deadly virus.

> The Diamond Princess, a liner belonging to California-based Princess Cruises, is currently on lockdown in waters off Yokohama&#039;s Daikoku Pier after it was discovered on Tuesday that a passenger had been diagnosed with the Wuhan coronavirus after traveling aboard the vessel for one leg of its scheduled 14-day cruise, reported CNN. The infected passenger was a Hong Kong man who had boarded in Yokohama on Jan. 20 and disembarked on Jan. 25 during a stop in the semiautonomous city, Princess Cruises said in a statement.

> The cruise liner reported there were 2,666 guests and 1,045 crew members on board.

This coronavirus gains entry to the cell through an enzyme called ACE2, which stands for angiotensin catalyzing enzyme 2.  Angiotensin regulates blood pressure so these enzymes are present lots of places but definitely in arteries.  A different coronavirus hCoV-NL63 has been linked to kawasaki disease, a sudden inflammation of the coronary arteries that happens in small children.  The mechanism isn't clear but some people think it triggers antibodies to be produced that match something in the blood vessels instead of just the virus, and this causes a runaway immune response, which makes the arteries more and more inflamed.  Something similar could happen here, the immune response could be triggering coronary artery inflammation."

Somebody with Coronavirus could take a bus and sneeze, affecting multiple people around them immediately, who then pass it on to other people.

Coronavirus can be transmitted via products that have come into contact with the virus.

2020-02-05,catsaysmrau,vancouver,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/vancouver/comments/eyycbb/2nd_presumptive_case_of_wuhan_coronavirus/fgl7rv4/,"The novel cornavirus appears to have a much higher mortality rate than seasonal influenza (2%, vs. 0.095% for influenza in the US). This may decrease as more information emerges of cases that may have occurred with survivors before this virus was recognized. While that still may not seem very deadly compared to the SARS mortality rate of around 10%, it has already infected many more than the 2003 SARS outbreak and is well on its way to kill more people in only 8 weeks, where SARS was over a 9-10 month span.


The novel coronavirus has estimated R0 between 1.4 and 2.5. To put that in perspective, the H1N1 (swine flu) epidemic of 2009 had an R0 of between 1.2 and 1.6. During that epidemic approximately between 11-21% of the world population was infected. R0 (R-naught) is the rate of person to person transmission. So for every one person that contracts it, they're estimated to statistically spread it to between 1.4 and 2.5 people. So not only is this virus deadlier than the ""regular ass flu"", it has potential to spread more aggressively than a virus that infected literally billions of people... in which case 2% would represent a tremendous amount of deaths.


It also seems to produce multiple false negatives in testing which is troublesome. And not much else is really known about it, hence the word ""novel""... it's new. Although its genome was sequenced very quickly compared to SARS, so that is definitely a plus, and governments currently have plenty of warning to prepare and take proactive public health measures which was not a luxury we had in Canada when cases started showing up in the emergency room in Toronto during the 2003 SARS outbreak.


I'd also wager that the data from China is unreliable and it's far more widespread than the international community is being lead to believe, which may prove to be a significant factor in the international response and the resulting spread. First hand accounts are leaking out little by little. China is trying to downplay the situation so as not to effect them economically. Other governments may feel pressure to follow suit.


So yes, most people in the developed world will probably be okay, but to downplay the severity of this on a worldwide scale is in my opinion reckless and uninformed. It's irrelevant to point out that something as ubiquitous as seasonal influenza has killed more people in x time-frame than this has so far. We all know that. Seasonal influenza and the novel coronavirus are not mutually exclusive public health issues. Flu shots are developed and distributed every year, there isn't a vaccine yet for this novel virus."

Nothing childish about calling it pseudoscience. It‚Äôs a fairly apt description since Chinese medicine has no basis in science. Calling western medicine a religion makes no sense whatsoever since religion is belief in the absence of facts and evidence, which western medicine does not do. 

>	I need to correct you though. The first hospital in Bangkok sent me away with medicines, bags full.. and I took them to no effect. The second hospital did the same, including overnight with IVs and constant medications, still the same result. It‚Äôs not like I refused their help. I paid for it, figuratively and literally, and it did nothing. I checked out when they wanted to cut my flesh off to figure out what to do. They seemed clueless.

I‚Äôm sorry, but this whole story reeks of something you‚Äôd read on /r/ThatHappened. What was the ‚Äòsevere‚Äô skin condition called? How ‚Äòsevere‚Äô was it? What were the symptoms? What were the expensive drugs they used. If the Chinese medicine doctor took one look and knew exactly what it was, then there‚Äôs now way that two hospitals didn‚Äôt know what they we‚Äôre dealing with. 

>	Now, if you‚Äôre trying to tell me the western system isn‚Äôt flawed based on the above, you‚Äôre simply not intelligent. 

You may convince more gullible and less intelligent people to question the effectiveness of western medicine based on a story like that, but I‚Äôll need more than just the highly embellished anecdotes of someone on reddit. 


>	The thing that works, no matter whether it‚Äôs back by science or magic, is the thing I want. I care not whether they do raindances and blow fairy dust in my face. No, I care that it actually WORKS. PERIOD.

These things are called placebos. That‚Äôs what you got, friend. 

Now, back to my original question. Are you honestly suggesting that the OP should go to see a Chinese medicine doctor and expect a cure for their diabetes?
Should people with cancer do the same? How about ways to treat the Wuhan coronavirus, should we enlist their help for this?"

**Article**:

> WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump took the stage for his State of the Union speech in an unfamiliar position: With the wind at his back. 

> For most of his three years in office, Trump has been surrounded by tumult, much of it of his own making, resulting ultimately in his impeachment by the House of Representatives. 

> Now, for the first time in a long time, things are looking up. 

> He is on the verge of being acquitted by his fellow Republicans in the U.S. Senate on Wednesday. Opinion polls show his approval ratings on an upswing. And the Democratic presidential nomination race was consumed by chaos as results from the Iowa caucuses this week were delayed by a full day because the mobile app used to record the results had a coding problem. 

> For Trump, the timing could not be better. 

> Despite being impeached, he is firmly entrenched in office, after surviving the Mueller investigation into Russian electoral interference and accusations that he abused his office by pressuring Ukraine to investigate a political rival, former vice president Joe Biden. 

> ‚ÄúHe has had existential political threats facing him from the moment he was elected until tomorrow,‚Äù said Texas-based Republican consultant Matt Mackowiak, referring to the impending acquittal vote on impeachment charges. 

> All of it brought out the showman in the former reality TV star during his State of the Union speech on Tuesday night. At one point, he choreographed a reunion between a U.S. servicemember returning from Afghanistan and his family to cheers from lawmakers. 

> Along that line, for much of the speech, Trump appeared to be making an overt appeal to suburban voters who could decide his fate. 

> He spoke of child-care initiatives, and efforts to combat AIDS and the opioid crisis. He called for greater transparency for medical bills, and he sought to take credit for protecting Americans with pre-existing healthcare conditions, even though his administration supports a lawsuit that would gut the Affordable Care Act. 

> Trump also touted bipartisan accomplishments such as the U.S.-Mexico-Canada trade deal and vowed to protect entitlement programs such as Medicare and Social Security. He pledged to protect the public from the coronavirus that is spreading in China and beyond. 

> But lest anyone think the combustible Trump had turned touchy-feely, he also reassured his hardline supporters by previewing what promises to be a recurrent campaign theme: accusing Democrats of supporting unlimited free healthcare to undocumented immigrants. 

> As he did during his first presidential campaign, he warned of the dangers of so-called ‚ÄúSanctuary Cities‚Äù and detailed incidents of violent crime committed by border-crossers. 

> Trump, too, seemed eager to exploit divisions among Democrats as they struggle to settle on a candidate who could mount the biggest threat to him. 

> The early favorite, Biden, appeared to have stumbled badly in Iowa, while U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders, a democratic socialist, was much more competitive. 

> At one point, Trump appeared to reference Sanders, who favors a government-run healthcare system, by declaring ‚ÄúWe will never let socialism destroy American healthcare!‚Äù 

> At a campaign event in New Hampshire, Sanders drew a laugh from the crowd on Tuesday when he questioned Trump‚Äôs pledge to improve healthcare in America: ‚ÄúReally? How gullible do you think the American people are?‚Äù he said. 

> In his speech to Congress, Trump did not address the most polarizing topic in the room, the months-long attempt by Democrats to remove him from office. He avoided any temptation to take a victory lap ahead of Wednesday‚Äôs Senate vote. 

> ‚ÄúIt was very smart to ignore the impeachment trial, stay above the fray and instead provide a laundry list of accomplishments along with proposals that will keep his base rock solid,‚Äù said Ron Bonjean, a Republican strategist in Washington. 

> That did not stop partisan tensions from running high. At the close of his remarks, Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi, who had orchestrated Trump‚Äôs impeachment in the House, tore up her copy of his speech. Earlier, Trump had refused to shake her hand upon entering the chamber. 

> While recent polls showed that more than 40 percent of Americans favored Trump‚Äôs conviction and removal from office on charges that he tried to persuade Ukraine to interfere in the coming election, Trump received good news from another poll on Tuesday. 

> The Gallup organi...

> According to the Reuters report, Chinese authorities have already culled 17,828 poultry in the wake of the outbreak...

Significant enough to be tested.

I however don't think that someone who hasn't been in close contact with a carrier but had flu and fever to be of significant risk of contracting the virus.

I do understand your concern but again, resource is finite, we have many other illnesses that we need to take care of as well. The labs in Singapore wouldn't be able to handle so many tests. Yes the latter is still possible just like how air disasters can happen and a person standing on the road can be struck by lightning - chances are still significantly low to the point where there's going to be diminishing returns. The resources could be used in other more sensible manner.

IMO, your idea of testing everyone with cough and fever isn't possible. The government doesn't just snap and suddenly more resources appeared. Firstly, companies that produces the test kit is going to focus on China first where the risk of contracting the virus is much higher. They're unlikely going to entertain Singapore if we're to ask them for test kits to test on people who are not at significant risk versus people who are in serious risk of contracting the virus in parts of China. Secondly, we need human resources to carry out the test. Where are we suppose to get people to carry out the test? In fact the government along the line in parliament that they'll only be testing those who are suspected cases because it would otherwise hog up the precious finite resources.

As I've pointed out to you, the case reported by NEJM is now being challenged. The German health agency said that the girl was symptomatic and took fever medicine and that NEJM did not contact the girl before reporting on the case. There's so far no actual proven case of asymptomatic transmission available to the public and we shouldn't speculate."

Vladivostok is the economic center of the whole far east and basically the only coastal russian city by the pacific ocean that actually matters. 

Khabarovsk used to be political core of the far east, but not anymore. it is still a prominent transport hub. 

Blagoveschensk doesn‚Äôt have much going to it, but it‚Äôs a nice city, it is located a river away from china and people travel between china and russia via ferry and recently built bridge all the time (at least before the coronavirus). 

Yakutsk ‚Äî see my other comment. 

Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk is unique in a way that it actually used to be a japanese city before WW2. because of that it has some japanese historic buildings. there is a diaspora of sakhalin koreans who were brought there by the japanese back in the day. it also attracts people as salaries are considerably higher there than in the mainland, but cost of life is higher too. 

Magadan is similar to Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk in a way that it has higher salaries and cost of life, but it is located in the mainland. it is known for for being a place where politically repressed people used to be dislocated by the soviet government. 

Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky is one of two russian mainland oblast centers that are inaccessible via roads and railroads. it is the center of kamchatka where almost all of volcanoes of russia are located, some of them are active. also incredible wilderness and landscapes. salaries and cost of life are high too. 

Anadyr is more of a town, it is small and located by the ocean, surrounded only by arctic wasteland."

They are studying a subgroup of infected people. They only include patients who have been infected (test positive) and have pneumonia severe enough that they require hospitalization. These are the absolute sickest of patients.

To my knowledge I don't think to date there have been any papers that specifically address mortality rate. I think it's because of reasons like this.  It's just too hard to tell. We have a number of papers on R0 and number of infected. If it were possible to calculate an overall mortality rate I think that would have been done.

1) Do the tourists in question represent their country? Absolutely. Do the massively discourteous/downright nasty/generally unpleasant/stupendously selfish ones (like that one woman you mentioned) give an impression that EVERYONE in the PRC acts that way? Absolutely. Does every single person from that country (and the diaspora by extension) act that way? **Heck no.** You being put in the same basket as said tourists is what the racists and bigots do. Please don't do it to yourself. 

&#x200B;

2) You are shocked and angry and disappointed about how the coronavirus outbreak has been and continues to be handled? About the blatant disregard\* for human suffering and lives imperiled? Wuhan locals and a lot of Chinese people (both PRC-side AND in the diaspora) are ***incensed and disappointed***. You guys are... literally on the same side of the issue here.

Also, given how the epidemic was initially handled (with a lot of censorship and hush-hush), most people who do end up getting the pneumonia outside of the PRC after travelling to or from there are innocent of both eating the weird shit AND carrying the virus around. That thing has an incubation period, after all. 

&#x200B;

3) I think ditching the instrument you're learning is a legitimately bad move. The culture isn't the one at fault here. The people who decide to twist it into the forms we on this subreddit abhor are the ones at fault. 

&#x200B;

4) No, there's nothing you can do about the fact that you are of Chinese descent and appearance. What you ***can*** do is fight against the racism and bigoted thinking that make that assumption (""you look Chinese""= you're straight from China"") in the first place.

Travelers could be isolated at a local location or asked to self-quarantine for 14 days.
Airline passengers suspected of having the coronavirus and others who recently visited China could be diverted to DFW International Airport, where local health officials will determine what to do with them.

DFW is among 11 U.S. airports that federal officials say will be staffed and equipped to handle passengers possibly exposed to the coronavirus, which is spreading from China worldwide. Officials with the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention are asking anyone returning to the U.S. from mainland China to be isolated for two weeks, sometimes at local sites and sometimes in their homes.

Airlines that learn mid-flight that passengers may be at risk for the virus could have planes diverted to DFW Airport, or at-risk passengers could be routed through DFW from other international destinations. Airlines are trying to screen passengers before takeoff to prevent that from happening.

‚ÄúThe strategy is not intended to catch every single traveler returning from China with 2019 novel coronavirus,‚Äù said the CDC‚Äôs Dr. Nancy Messonnier in a news conference Monday. ‚ÄúThe goal is to slow the entry of this virus into the United States.‚Äù
U.S. officials are warning travelers not to go to mainland China until the coronavirus epidemic is managed. Airlines have already canceled dozens of flights to China and the union for American Airlines pilots wants the Fort Worth-based carrier to cancel routes to Hong Kong, too.

The coronavirus causes fever and pneumonia-like symptoms and can be particularly hazardous to the elderly. Through Sunday, the World Health Organization reported 14,557 cases globally. More than 360 deaths are linked to the virus.

But what about Americans and other travelers coming to the U.S. from China?

Quarantines are possible

With 11 confirmed cases in the U.S., federal officials have diverted nearly 200 Americans who recently visited the Hubei region of China to an Air Force Reserve base in California where they will be quarantined for two weeks. All foreign nationals who‚Äôve been in mainland China in the last 14 days are banned from traveling to the U.S. But family members of U.S. citizens and permanent residents will not be turned away.
The CDC dispatched health workers to DFW Airport and a handful of other airports across the country to screen passengers getting off planes for fever, cough and difficulty breathing.

As of Monday, passengers who‚Äôve been to Hubei Province, the epicenter of the outbreak, in the last two weeks will be diverted to one of the 11 U.S. airports and quarantined by local health departments for two weeks or taken to a medical center for treatment. Those with symptoms will be transferred to a local facility for treatment and won‚Äôt be allowed to finish their flight itineraries.
‚ÄúIf asymptomatic [not showing signs of illness], they will be subjected to mandatory isolation near that location,‚Äù Messonnier said. Local health officials will determine where to take them, and sites could range from military bases to hotels, she said.

Dallas County officials have not responded to The Dallas Morning News‚Äô requests for isolation plans for potentially infected travelers.

Other travelers to China

The CDC is also going to be screening passengers who‚Äôve visited other parts of China in the last two weeks, except for Hong Kong and Macao.

People showing symptoms will be transferred for further evaluation, Messonnier said, and won‚Äôt be able to complete their connecting flights to other locations.

Passengers not showing symptoms will be allowed to finish their flights to their final destinations but will be asked to self-quarantine for 14 days, roughly the maximum length of time it takes to show symptoms from coronavirus.
Local plans for at-risk patients

Dr. Philip Huang, director of Dallas County Health and Human Services, is expected to brief the county Commissioners Court Tuesday morning on the coronavirus and flu. In previous statements, Huang downplayed the potential health risk of the virus and stressed the danger of the flu, which has killed more than two dozen people locally.
What are airlines doing?

American Airlines has canceled U.S. flights to mainland China through March 28 and halted flights to Hong Kong over the weekend. It is making the call on Hong Kong flights on a day-by-day basis, spokesman Curtis Blessing said.

American has canceled U.S.-to-Hong Kong flights through Wednesday, according to the Allied Pilots Association.

American and other airlines are screening passengers before they depart from foreign airports. The precaution should help the airline from having to reroute any flights in mid-air.

Meanwhile, the union representing American Airlines pilots is pushing the carrier to cancel all flights to China, including Hong Kong, said spokesman Dennis Tajer.

‚ÄúContinuing American‚Äôs service to all of China, including Hong Kong is our collaborative goal but only when all stakeholders believe it‚Äôs safe to do so,‚Äù Tajer said.
The union sued to stop flights to Hong Kong and is awaiting a ruling from a Dallas County judge. Meanwhile, the Allied Pilots Association has directed pilots to turn down assignments to China, citing health risks.

American flies one daily trip in each direction between DFW and Hong Kong, as well as from Los Angeles International. Those flights have been canceled through Monday but were still scheduled for Tuesday.

No, that 0.1% is only the limit of the extent to which we can reliably tell whether there are any bacteria left. 

Sufficiently concentrated alcohol denatures proteins which bacteria and viruses are made of. This leaves no possibility of survival to the affected organism.

And even if there really were 0.1% pathogens left on a surface, it is far less likely to result in infection when you come in contact with it."

Taiwan had in practice already stopped entry to most Chinese citizens, but this ban, announced by the Central Epidemic Command Centre, extends that restriction.

Taiwan has only reported 11 cases of the virus, compared with more than 24,000 in China, and Taiwan‚Äôs government has moved to prevent it from spreading further on the island, including tightening entry requirements.

> SEOUL/SINGAPORE (REUTERS) - An international business gathering at a plush Singapore hotel has been linked to coronavirus cases that have spread across the region, in a worrying sign of secondary transmissions from an epidemic that originated in China.

> Malaysia on Tuesday (Feb 4) said its first citizen to be infected with the virus - a 41-year-old man - had attended a meeting in Singapore in mid-January that had included several international delegations, some from China.

> A 38-year-old South Korean who came into contact with the Malaysian when he travelled to Singapore for a business conference has also been infected, the Korea Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) said on Wednesday.

> The South Korean man had a meal with the Malaysian man, as well as several other South Koreans, during the conference, South Korea's Joongang Ilbo newspaper reported.

> Singapore's Health Ministry said on Tuesday that the meeting involving the Malaysian took place at the Grand Hyatt Hotel, adding that the city-state was working to identify individuals in close contact with the cases.

> The Health Ministry did not immediately reply to a request for additional comment on the Korean case on Wednesday.

> A spokesman for the Grand Hyatt Hotel in Singapore could not be immediately reached for comment.

> Singapore - one of the worst-hit countries outside China in the 2003 outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (Sars) - has reported 24 cases of coronavirus, including some local transmission cases.

> The death toll from the epidemic - believed to have surfaced late last year in a market selling illegal wildlife at the central Chinese city of Wuhan - passed 490 on Wednesday.

> It is theoretically possible to work towards zero growth in Singapore's foreign manpower, but it is very hard to achieve it in practice without serious implications and trade-offs for the economy, Trade and Industry Minister Chan Chun Sing said yesterday.

> Such a move could result in missed investments, and company closures and job losses for Singaporeans, he told the House in his response to Mr Liang Eng Hwa (Holland-Bukit Timah GRC).

> Managing the growth of the foreign workforce is especially crucial as the size of the local labour force will peak in the next 10 years, said Mr Chan. This is due to the country's low birth rate and high labour force participation rate, which refers to the proportion of the population aged 15 and older who are either working or looking for work.

> ""If we maintain the current ratio of local (workers) to foreign (workers), when local peaks, foreign must peak, when local falls, foreign must fall - and the total must fall,"" he said. ""If we maintain the total, a stable total as local peaks and falls, foreign must take up the slack, which means the ratio must change. But whether the ratio can change will depend on whether our society can accept the change.""

> The issue sparked an exchange between two government office holders and Workers' Party (WP) chief Pritam Singh, who suggested that a more extensive discussion on population policy be held outside the typical 90-minute question-and-answer (Q&A) time at a Parliament sitting.

> Mr Chan noted that the WP had advocated zero growth in foreign manpower in the past.

> Three tough scenarios

> But such a policy could result in three difficult scenarios, Mr Chan said, elaborating on an example that he gave at last month's Parliament sitting.

> First, a Singaporean could be earning $5,000 a month in his job, and a potential investment would create two jobs, one paying $7,000 and the other, $10,000.

> With Singapore essentially at full employment and having a high labour force participation rate, if no new foreigners are allowed, there may be no spare capacity to take up the new jobs and the country would have to forgo the investment.

> Second, a temporary surge in complementary foreigners could be allowed in to fill the new $7,000 and $10,000 jobs and Singaporeans doing the $5,000 jobs would move later to replace them. But if no new foreigners come in to replace the Singaporeans, their company would probably have to close and the rest of its Singaporean employees would be out of work, said Mr Chan.

> Related Story Parliament: Total employment in 23 key industries grew between 2015 and 2018

> Related Story Update to rules that deter discrimination against Singaporeans in hiring practices

> The third scenario is the most ideal, where productivity improves and the company with $5,000 jobs can release two Singaporeans to be retrained to take on the higher-paying jobs without needing new foreign workers. ""That is ideal but we also know that in the real world it is not easy to do, because different industries will have different opportunities for productivity growth... and the speed and scale at which we can retrain and upskill our workers are dependent on many factors. Whether we can do it in time to catch the new investment is always uncertain,"" said Mr Chan.

> Manufacturing tends to have higher productivity growth than services, for instance, he noted.

> Foreign workforce growth is thus one way to allow for the circulation of manpower to overcome these limitations, he said.

> Immigrants and unrequited love

> WP's Mr Singh said his party had called for zero foreign manpower growth during the debate on the Government's 2013 Population White Paper, but it was conditional on the resident workforce growing at an annual rate of 1 per cent. The WP also made the point in its manifesto for the 2015 General Election.

> During the 2013 debate, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong said there would be a review of plans in the Population White Paper closer to 2020. Referring to it, Mr Singh asked if there would be a debate or motion to allow for a more extensive discussion on the population policy, given how significant the upcoming decade will be for Singapore's overall strategy.

> He noted that parliamentary rules on Q&A time state that it should not be a pretext for a debate. ""We've had episodes where Q&A time goes on to a pretty substantive issue and I think we perhaps should deal with it in another way.""

> Replying, Mr Chan said the Government would be happy to discuss such issues in more depth with MPs. ""As leaders in our various capacity, we need to understand and have a shared understanding of these challenges, so that we can collectively carry the ground for the difficult decisions that we all have to take together for the next decade,"" he added.

> He also said it is not a given that Singapore can achieve 1 per cent resident workforce growth or even the target economic growth trajectory. The current coronavirus outbreak originating in Wuhan, for instance, will have a significant impact on the economy.

> Further, it is not a given that new immigrants will always choose to come to Singapore and supplement the citizen population. ""I always jokingly say immigration is the story of unrequited love - those that we want may not want us, those that we don't want may all want to come,"" said the minister.

> WP on why it asks for data

> Senior Minister of State for Trade and Industry Chee Hong Tat also sought clarification from Mr Singh on whether he did support the need for a local-foreign workforce complement.

> Mr Singh said the balance is something his party has to look at very carefully, which is why it often asks for government data.

> ""All the time we ask for data, it's not data for the sake of data. It's to understand the Government's perspective, because it's not a case of throwing whatever the Government is saying out of the window or turning up our noses at it.

> ""But certainly we have to look at it very carefully. And if the Government makes a compelling case, then there's no reason for us to be objectionable about it,"" he said.

Mobile World Congress, the world‚Äôs biggest mobile technology showcase and launch pad for a renewed 5G-devices push this year, is taking a hit from the deadly coronavirus outbreak with two marquee names canceling plans.

The show, operated by mobile industry trade organization GSMA, takes place from Feb. 24 to 27, but at least one global tech giant has already decided to skip it. South Korea‚Äôs LG Electronics Inc. is withdrawing from exhibiting at the conference because, it said, most health experts advised against ‚Äúneedlessly‚Äù exposing hundreds of employees to international travel.

Shenzhen, China-based ZTE Corp., which makes smartphones and wireless networking equipment, has cited difficulties in traveling out of China while virus-containment restrictions are in place at the country, and so it‚Äôs canceling its MWC press conference, though it will still send a delegation.

These companies usually occupy two of the largest, most central exhibition zones at the Fira Gran Via venue, and both were expected to contribute to an industrywide push to make fifth-generation networking and devices mainstream this year. ZTE plans to roll out ‚Äúa wide variety of new 5G devices‚Äù and will keep its usual exhibition spot. LG, keen to match compatriot archrival Samsung Electronics Co., maintains an outsize presence at the show even when it doesn‚Äôt launch any major new products, and so its absence this year will be obvious to attendees.

Other Asia-based companies are also closely monitoring the coronavirus outbreak and may yet alter their plans, however most are sticking to their existing programs.

-	Lenovo Group Ltd., parent of Motorola, says its MWC plans are still under discussion.

-	Xiaomi Corp. is sending its contingent to Barcelona as soon as possible ‚Äúand will make necessary adjustment accordingly,‚Äù a spokesman said.

-	Samsung, Oppo, Huawei Technologies Co., Microsoft Corp. and MediaTek Inc. representatives all said their companies are preparing for MWC as planned.

Several major U.S. technology firms, including Qualcomm Inc. and Alphabet Inc.‚Äôs Google, are also scheduled to participate and play big roles at this year‚Äôs conference.

On its website, the GSMA says it ‚Äúcontinues to monitor and assess the potential impact of the coronavirus‚Äù on its event and has ‚Äúimplemented many measures to help to mitigate the spread of the virus and is continuing to add other actions regularly.‚Äù

Either this has a very high mortality rate, or it's so outrageously infectious that hundreds of thousands were already infected by early January."

I'm not sure if giving them some facts on the virus will help - that the risk of contracting it from the packages is very low. The virus can't survive for long without a host, at least according to the [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/faq.html) and the [World Health Organization](https://twitter.com/who/status/1223532656778010624). As well, most of the deaths are linked to individuals with weak immune systems - so mostly children and elders. Though this isn't to say that the virus isn't serious cause it definitely is. I assume there have also been delays with your orders due to the lockdown? (Yep, you guessed it, some marketing is coming your way sorry please don't block me). Have you considered using Spocket as an alternative in the meantime? Perhaps sourcing out from EU and US suppliers could be a solution and let you continue store operations. If you want to know more you can visit the [official website](https://www.spocket.co/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=posts) or join the [Facebook group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/spocketofficial/)!

None of that has anything to do with what I stated. I said the state has superior information *control*. Keyword: control. A rebel group will never be on the level and skill of an intelligence agency.

The internet is not magic like you believe it to be. One trip to your ISP with a few g-men and your information through the internet has been cut off or secretly filtered. Then you have to trust the media, which can also be easily hijacked by the state. This is all very fragile.

>A revolution without arms is not a revolution.

According to who? This doesn't say anything about arms: https://www.dictionary.com/browse/revolution

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonviolent_revolution

You don't need weapons to revolt, you need a will to revolt. You can do it via economic warfare, protests, etc. There are many examples of this in history.

>Maybe the problem here is you overestimate how badly the average American wants to fight for the causes that you think are revolution-worthy.

If I'm overestimating it in the first place, then the average America will never revolt in a hundred years. The average American isn't going to do jack shit, it's a farce. Nobody wants to risk their life to fight the government unless they're going to die anyway, which is why I hinted at the October Revolution.

&#x200B;

>The R0 is significantly higher than seasonal flu.

Yes the R0 estimates are high, but it is important to know that unless an disease is endemic, the R0 number is not destiny. R0 can change regionally, and can change based on the avaliability of healthcare, public awarness of the epidemic, and more.

Most studies I've found that have estimated 2019-nCoV's R0 were based on the early period of the epidemic, where public awarness of the epidemic was minor.

They also estimate the R0 number in *Huebi*, not for say an international traveler who has recently visted China, and will incresingly face medical scrutiny upon repatriation.

&#x200B;

>\- The  incubation period is longer any upper respiratory strain ever  discovered. That makes effective disease control ridiculously difficult.

I couldn't find a reliable source for this. The best number I have is the high end of the [CDC's estimate of the viruses incubation window](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/about/symptoms.html), 2 - 14 days. Which is A) the *range*, and B) Based on data from previous coronavirus outbreaks (particularly MERS \[which also had upper respiratory effects\]), which is by definition not ""longer than any period ... ever discovered"".

The [WHO sitrep from January 27](https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/situation-reports/20200127-sitrep-7-2019--ncov.pdf?sfvrsn=98ef79f5_2) (the latest with an estimate for the incubation period) actually puts this range in the 2 - 10 range.

Additionally, the [WHO sitrep from February 1](https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/situation-reports/20200201-sitrep-12-ncov.pdf?sfvrsn=273c5d35_2) states that ""The main driver of transmission,based on currently available data, is symptomatic cases"", while also confirming that asymptomatic transmition, though it exists, is rare. Meaning that although the incubation period (which again, isn't ""apocalyptically"" long) can hamper tracking infected individuals, they are propbly not running around as typhoid Marys.

&#x200B;

>\- 2019-nCov is potentially airborne, which makes it even harder to control than influenza.

Influenza is an airborne desiease, as is (mostly likely) 2019-nCoV. Airborne desieases are transmitted by fine particals and or droplets. Based on the behaviour of previous coronavirus outbreaks, this appears to be limited to droplets.

And I'm assuming that's what you mean by ariborne and not that the virus is transmitted through some formless miasma.

&#x200B;

>\- Confirmed  cases of Coronavirus continue to increase at a rate of 15% per day, and  have consistently held that rate for the past three weeks. In other  words quarantine measures show not yet shown any sign of slowing the  growth.

Ok, where is that number from? I haven't crunched the numbers, but I will add that it is important to differentiate between the numbers inside China, and those outside.

[**The**](https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/situation-reports/20200204-sitrep-15-ncov.pdf) [**last**](https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/situation-reports/20200203-sitrep-14-ncov.pdf) [**three**](https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/situation-reports/20200202-sitrep-13-ncov-v3.pdf) **daily WHO sitrep reports have opened with the line ""No new countries reported cases of 2019-nCoV in the 24 hourssince the previous situation report.""**

In addition, in those contries where the desiese is present, the number of new infected outside China had dropped from 26 cases on the 1st of this month, to 14 on the 2nd, to 7 on the 3rd, to 6 on the 4th, the WHO has yet to publish a sitrep today.

In addition, the number of infected in china does not seem to be ""exploding"", though it is large."

(February 5, 2020, 12:00 AM EST Updated on February 5, 2020, 6:47 AM EST)

‚Äî With assistance by Dong Lyu, Haze Fan, Jason Gale, and Robert Langreth


* Wuhan‚Äôs virology institute has applied for remdesivir‚Äôs patent

* Gilead said human trials on the drug have begun in China

Chinese researchers have applied for a national patent on an experimental Gilead Sciences Inc. drug that they believe might fight the novel coronavirus.

The Wuhan Institute of Virology -- based in the Chinese city at the center of the epidemic -- has applied for a patent in China for the use of the antiviral drug, known as remdesivir, in treating the ailment. The application was made on Jan. 21 together with a military academy, according to a Feb. 4 statement on the institute‚Äôs website.

Large areas of China have been paralyzed by the coronavirus, and the move signals a desire to speed development of one of the most promising potential treatments. Beijing has moved aggressively to contain the infection that has killed almost 500 people and sickened nearly 25,000. If the application succeeds, Gilead would need to get Chinese patent owners on board in sales of the drug for treating coronavirus infections outside China.

‚ÄúThe good thing in having a patent is that it would lead to cross-licensing situations that give China more bargaining chips in negotiating the licensing fee with Gilead,‚Äù said Wang Yanyu, a senior partner at AllBright Law Offices in Beijing.

**IP Concern**

The move may revive longstanding concerns about China‚Äôs respect for intellectual property rights. The country has made strides in the pharmaceutical space in recent years as it works to nurture a domestic industry based on innovative drugs.

It‚Äôs not clear if or when China‚Äôs intellectual property authorities will approve the institute‚Äôs application. The patent filing will need to prove that the drug works on this coronavirus strain, 2019-nCoV, in a way that‚Äôs different from its effect on other viruses in the same category.

Filing of the patent application by a stakeholder in China, however, makes sense, according to Wang. ‚ÄúMost of the patients are here, rather than in the U.S., which makes it unlikely that Gilead will do all these tests,‚Äù he said.

Coronavirus Lurking in Feces May Reveal Hidden Risk of Spread

While Gilead‚Äôs experimental drug isn‚Äôt licensed or approved anywhere in the world, it is being rushed into trials in China on coronavirus patients after showing early signs of being highly effective. It may go into clinical trials in China as early as next week in patients with moderate and severe symptoms of the pathogen, said Merdad Parsey, Gilead‚Äôs chief medical officer.

Chinese scientists have found Gilead‚Äôs remdesivir, and chloroquine, an 80-year-old malaria drug, ‚Äúhighly effective‚Äù in laboratory studies at thwarting the coronavirus, they said Tuesday in a paper in the journal Cell Research. The two drugs‚Äô efficacy on humans required further clinical tests, the institute said in its statement.

**Wants Access**

China is capable of manufacturing chloroquine and now wants access to remdesivir.

The decision, however, to seek a patent instead of invoking the heavy-handed ‚Äúcompulsory license‚Äù option that lets nations override drug patents in national emergencies, underscores the delicate balancing act before China as it signals commitment toward intellectual property rights alongside curbing the virus outbreak.

‚ÄúThe fact that they have applied for a patent means there‚Äôs growing awareness about this in the country,‚Äù said Wang. ‚ÄúThe government is compelled to avoid using the compulsory license because it has been making efforts to show China respects intellectual property rights and the abuse of compulsory licensing will draw international criticism.‚Äù

**National Interest**

Gilead will retain the global rights to market the antiviral medication, once approved, in treating illnesses such as Ebola and SARS for which the drug was originally intended.

The Wuhan institute said in its statement that it made the patent application out of national interest, and won‚Äôt exercise its patent rights if foreign pharmaceutical firms work together with China to curb the contagion.

At its end, Gilead is shipping enough doses to treat 500 patients and is ramping up supply in case the clinical trials work.

While the drug is challenging to produce, Gilead is working as fast as possible to produce more, according to Parsey. ‚ÄúIt has been very no-holds-barred on our side,‚Äù he said."

The exact cause and effect I'm not sure has been established but it shouldn't be surprising that eating a food with high concentrations of beneficial vitamins and enzymes should be good for you. Generally a healthy diet helps in warding off illnesses. It's better than stuffing yourself with burgers for sure.

Coronavirus is a different tale however. There's no indications that kimchi or other dietary factors have any effect.

Apparently though, according to some people at the Girls Frontline subreddit, the most recent update has been extremely buggy and the community is waiting on the devs to fix it, though the coronavirus situation over in China has been causing a lot of setbacks for the devs there. I'm putting the game down temporarily to see if this issue gets fixed. If it doesn't, then I'll try emulating it on Nox on my PC.

2020-02-05,Be_Braver,Teachers,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Teachers/comments/ez0t8h/dark_truth_to_a_kindergartners_question/fgltt52/,"Dear friend, Where to begin here. First let me address your comment of ""melodrama"" As you can read in my original post, I did not say this to my student. I also have it listed as ""humor"" in the flair, which means I was not taking myself seriously when I said that. Please read carefully before letting your biases take you on a rant.   


Also to your comment about ignoring the extreme cold, you are correct. There are actually models that show that the end result fo global warming will actually cause an ice-age. The most important thing to look out for with global warming is really just extreme weather patterns which will become more frequent, such as more category 5 hurricanes, more extreme wildfires, etc. However scientists have stated that NJ (my state) has been most effected from global warming in the US compared to any other state. Our temperatures have actually risen an average of about 4 degrees, compared to the national average of 2 and change. We also have forests dying because of sea-level rise and the salt water coming in and destroying the land. We have a town not too far from where I live that has to buy homes from it's citizens because houses are sinking.

Third, no where in my comment did I say the earth was dying RIGHT NOW. Yes, by 2040 the polar ice caps will have melted so much we can sail over the North Pole! (sorry Santa, and Polar Bears) But I am educated enough to know that although climate change is effecting us as we speak, aka NOW. It isn't going to become completely uninhabitable in 12 years. Honestly, no one said 12 years... only you. Us humans are going to have to endure a lot worse than a swift 12 year death.   


Fourth I think you mean WWIII, WWII already happened... like 80-90 years ago. And to that point, China is actually making some headway, albeit because they were the worse offenders, and the number one polluting country on the planet. But they are taking very drastic measures (though a little distracted by the coronavirus ATM) Things like reforesting their lands with ""seed bombs"" dropped from planes, and have even adopted a policy of environmental transparency, so they can actually be held accountable. That being said it is for sure NOT enough, and they need to do more, and I agree we should be pressuring them more.  


As for India you are correct with them being a major polluter, and as you stated there is the issue of economics here, as with many other countries and the environment. However it is a well known fact in the global community that as first world countries advance third world countries benefit because when they are able they can use the more advance technology rather than having to start from scratch with less efficient/high carbon impact technology. They have done this with cell phones. Since they skipped land-lines (for the most part) they didn't use all those resources needed to set up that system.

Community spread is when someone tested positive for coronavirus but die die never interacted with people with known infections (e.g. Malay kid kena virus, but was never near any known cases/clusters). That is when we panic like crazy."

Additionally, the Chinese are saying that the number of people who were infected and fought off the infection is rising as the days go by (I read that around 500+ have successfully fought it). 

There are currently 5 confirmed infections in the US, all of whom are quarantined, and only one death outside of China (Philippines) thus far. For people who live in Europe, Canada, the US, UK, Japan, or really any highly developed nation with a robust healthcare system, there is no immediate concern; you are more in danger of contracting the flu, not the coronavirus as the user above implied.

I have never seen any news media claiming that it is ""the cure"" for all coronavirus as  you are implying. I have only seen articles saying it cures one patient and more work is needed. 

\>  Chinese doctors had already used the same cure in China, and you'll notice that their death numbers are still rising, not falling.

1. Some recent reports are coming out that while the Coronavirus is still spreading and deadly that it isn‚Äôt as quick and rumors that there maybe a drug cocktail available to help drive towards a cure.  

2. Clusterfuck in Iowa and impeachment trial conclusion have raised the chance that Trump may have a higher chance at re-election.  If Bernie or Warren won or had a legitimate shot at presidency, I am not sure the market would really like that in the short term.

3. Earning season was good not great but some real winners in Apple and Amazon which continues to lead investment higher.

4. Where the hell else are you getting any kind of return with the 10yr at 1.6ish %.  Lots is cash around and I think folks may have paused in Jan but now what?  Just let it sit there doing nothing?

Beijing:¬†
A baby in China's epidemic-hit Wuhan city has been diagnosed with the novel coronavirus just 30 hours after being born, Chinese state media reported Wednesday.
The infant is the youngest person recorded as being infected by the virus, which has killed nearly 500 people since emerging late last year.

CCTV quoted experts as saying it may be a case of ""vertical transmission"", referring to infections passed from mother to child during pregnancy, childbirth or immediately after.
The official Xinhua news agency reported Monday that a baby born last week to an infected mother had tested negative.
The disease is believed to have emerged in December in a Wuhan market that sold wild animals, and spread rapidly as people travelled for the Lunar New Year holiday in January.
China's national health commission said on Tuesday that the oldest person diagnosed with the virus is a 90-year-old, and that 80 percent of reported deaths have been of patients 60 years of age and older.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - About 350 Americans who left Wuhan, China, aboard two planes arrived at a U.S. military base in California on Wednesday, in Washington‚Äôs latest effort to fly its citizens away from the epicenter of the coronavirus outbreak.

The U.S. travelers on two State Department-chartered flights will be quarantined for 14 days after landing, the U.S. Defense Department said in a statement. The jets landed at Travis Air Force Base, about midway between San Francisco and Sacramento, KNTV television reported, showing images of two planes on the tarmac on its website.

One of the planes will continue on to Miramar Marine Corps Air Station in San Diego after refueling, the Pentagon said, and was due to arrive at Miramar between 6 a.m. and 9 a.m. Pacific time (between 1400 and 1700 GMT), a Marine Corps spokesman said in a statement.

The State Department separately said it may stage additional flights on Thursday but gave no other details. The United States and other countries are seeking to evacuate their citizens from China, where the fast-spreading outbreak has killed 490 people. Two deaths have been reported outside of the mainland.

U.S. health officials have reported 11 confirmed cases of the virus in the United States so far, including two person-to-person transmissions. The Trump administration declared a public health emergency on Jan. 31, and announced the extraordinary measures of barring the entry of foreign nationals who have recently visited China and imposing a mandatory two-week quarantine for travelers from China‚Äôs affected province. The State Department issued a ‚ÄúDo Not Travel‚Äù to China advisory to U.S. citizens, advising them to return on commercial flights if possible, though some commercial airlines have suspended flights to or from major Chinese cities. U.S. officials have also restricted flights from China to 11 designated airports deemed capable of carrying out enhanced screening.

Nearly 200 Americans were evacuated late last month, mostly U.S. diplomats and their families, and they were flown to March Air Force Base east of Los Angeles.

There's evidence to suggest that east Asian populations are specifically more vulnerable to this virus.

https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.01.26.919985v1.full

Here's a short portion from the paper that seems indicative. Though most of it as a whole is concerned with implications on treatment if for some reason east Asians are more vulnerable to this :

""We also noticed that the only Asian donor (male) has a much higher ACE2-expressing cell ratio than white and African American donors (2.50% vs. 0.47% of all cells). This might explain the observation that the new Coronavirus pandemic and previous SARS-Cov pandemic are concentrated in the Asian area.""

This could just be a matter of accidental genetic susceptibility. Or if you want to theorize about it, it sounds in the wheel house of a racially targeted bio-weapon, or possible precursor to something like that.

The USA and South Africa are countries that have definitively invested time into this research for instance, no doubt other countries have considered ethnic genetic marker exploiting diseases.

This may be an accidental release by Chinese researchers (I have no idea why they'd make a plague for their own majority populace though), a proof of concept, or hell maybe even biological warfare from the USA."

A family member will be flying from Seoul to the US to visit me... how worried should I be about them catching the virus and passing it to my family (and potentially others)? They will be staying with me in my house for 5 days. 

I‚Äôve casually broached the subject and they don‚Äôt seem very worried and say people there aren‚Äôt particularly panicked.

Some Britons in China have been in touch with the Guardian to say they have no plans to leave the country any time soon.

Sharon Moan, a chemistry teacher who lives with her husband and two children in Shanghai, said she is baffled by the foreign office‚Äôs advice.

‚ÄúLife here is very calm. We have few restrictions and feel that everything the local government has put in place is for everybody‚Äôs benefit. We actually only began to panic when we read Western media news reports that do not reflect what is happening here. We don‚Äôt feel it‚Äôs necessary and many of our colleagues feel the same.

‚ÄúWe feel unsupported by the consulate as there is no clear explanation as to why they have made this announcement. This is our home and the foreign office hasn‚Äôt actually given us a good reason to leave it. We have no plans to leave and will carry on regardless.‚Äù

Dr Rob Burton, a 65-year-old academic living in a state of self-quarantine in Hangzhou with his Chinese wife, said he is under no illusion that she would be allowed entry to the UK.

‚ÄúI have a life here and my semester at the Communication University of Zhejiang is due to start on 24 February. I feel that the attitude by the foreign office towards British nationals who are married to foreign spouses is toxic. I‚Äôm not going to say goodbye to my wife and leave her stranded on her own. Who would do that? It would actually be easier for me to get my English dog, Snooky, and Chinese cat, Fluffy Bum (named in honour of Spike Milligan), home than it would my wife.

‚ÄúI was actually in Wuhan in November so have had a few weeks of wondering if I have been infected. We have been inside for 15 days now and have only been to the supermarket twice. It becomes a psychological test as you become more stir crazy as the rumours mount up. That said, there is a huge effort going on by ordinary Chinese people which I don‚Äôt see much about in the foreign press.‚Äù

Sean, who didn‚Äôt want to give his last name, said it was ‚Äúincredibly eerie in Beijing today‚Äù. The 34-year-old manager of an English language school said there was heavy snow and few people on the street. ‚ÄúI worked from a cafe today, and was the only one inside.‚Äù

He described the Foreign Office‚Äôs advice to ‚Äòleave China‚Äô last night as ‚Äúa huge over-reaction and disregard for expats that actually live here and call China their home‚Äù.

Sean added: ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not simply a matter of hopping on a plane, it‚Äôs a huge undertaking. It seemed to be a decision disconnected from the reality.‚Äù

He pointed out that Beijing is thousands of kilometres from Hubei, the epicentre of the outbreak. ‚ÄúIt seems strange to refer to China as a whole, we are talking about a country almost the size of Europe, and to evacuate the entire territory seems a bit much,‚Äù Sean said."

It put me in the hospital for a day a few weeks ago, I had to get on oxygen and fluids and use the heck out of an incentive spirometer with decongestants  to clear out my chest.. I do have a somewhat compromised immune system due to my Crohn's medicine, but otherwise am a healthy adult in good shape with a clean whole foods diet and consistent sleep. 

if flu b can put me in the hospital with respiratory distress, I'm certainly concerned about coronavirus.  That's the thing though, even if you're confidant you're okay... how many people do you know...or do you work with...or are you related to... that are particularly susceptible to pneumonia?  Like...... you have to know at least a few people with autoimmune disease.  Come in contact with some elderly or babies.   Overreacting is silly, but reducing the spread is pretty important.  Eventually we are going to be faced with something more deadly as well, so this is good practice for that.  a 2 to 3% death rate is still killing tens of thousands of people when this goes global.  its easy to see that as a statistic and forget those are all people sometimes."

1. There were roughly 3M deaths in the US in 2017.  
2. The equivalent of 10% of the US population is quarantined in China.  
3. The virus has been around since December, so roughly 10% of a year.  

Therefore, we should expect roughly 30K total deaths in those areas even if the outbreak wasn't a thing. Since there aren't enough test kits to find out what portion were related to the coronavirus, you just have to make educated guesses."

There are 2 with a access system that border patrol use to patrol. In addition to that, there are cameras and sensors that monitor the wall.

That means, border patrol can respond and pick up people that may climb over. 

A sick person, especially with this coronavirus, is much less likely to climb the wall vs. going through the desert. Also, people 'guide' illegal immigrants through the border and usually arrange pickup as well. So by having a wall, it slows that down considerably. 

The same principles of quarantining someone with a contagion works here. You do not want someone infected to illegally cross the border and get into the general public. That creates new infections in multiple areas that make it MUCH harder to contain.

I find it strange that you are playing politics when we are on the verge of a pandemic."
