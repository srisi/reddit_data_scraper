- Barely enough respirators for the flu season, let alone flu season + coronavirus

I find the ban on bankruptcy proceedings quite intersting though. I have been thinking about how the economic impact of the coronavirus is what is, worryingly, driving the inadequate responses and policies of governments worldwide. What we need to do is simply shut the economy down temporarily. Close the stockmarkets, and pass legislation that temporarily prevents enforcing debts or money owed or bankruptcy proceedings. Then you can have a response that is driven by safety, caution, and the value of human life, not economics."

Info  from James Robb, MD FCAP, a renowned pathologist:   

 Dear Family and Friends, as some of you may recall, when I was a  professor of pathology at the University of California San Diego, I was  one of the first molecular virologists in the world to work on  coronaviruses (the 1970s). I was the first to demonstrate the number of  genes the virus contained. Since then, I have kept up with the  coronavirus field and its multiple clinical transfers into the human  population (e.g., SARS, MERS), from different animal sources.

The  current projections for its expansion in the US are only probable, due  to continued insufficient worldwide data, but it is most likely to be  widespread by mid to late March and April.

Here is what I have  done and the precautions that I take and will take. These are the same  precautions I currently use during our influenza seasons, except for the  mask and gloves.:

1) NO HANDSHAKING! Use a fist bump, slight bow, elbow bump, etc.

 2) Use ONLY your knuckle to touch light switches. elevator buttons,  etc.. Lift the gasoline dispenser with a paper towel or use a disposable  glove.

3) Open doors with your closed fist or hip - do not grasp  the handle with your hand, unless there is no other way to open the  door. Especially important on bathroom and post office/commercial doors.

4) Use disinfectant wipes at the stores when they are available, including wiping the handle and child seat in grocery carts.

 5) Wash your hands with soap for 10-20 seconds and/or use a greater  than 60% alcohol-based hand sanitizer whenever you return home from ANY  activity that involves locations where other people have been.

6)  Keep a bottle of sanitizer available at each of your home's entrances.  AND in your car for use after getting gas or touching other contaminated  objects when you can't immediately wash your hands.

7) If  possible, cough or sneeze into a disposable tissue and discard. Use your  elbow only if you have to. The clothing on your elbow will contain  infectious virus that can be passed on for up to a week or more!

What I have stocked in preparation for the pandemic spread to the US:

 1) Latex or nitrile latex disposable gloves for use when going  shopping, using the gasoline pump, and all other outside activity when  you come in contact with contaminated areas.

Note: This  virus is spread in large droplets by coughing and sneezing. This means  that the air will not infect you! BUT all the surfaces where these  droplets land are infectious for about a week on average - everything  that is associated with infected people will be contaminated and  potentially infectious. The virus is on surfaces and you will not be  infected unless your unprotected face is directly coughed or sneezed  upon. This virus only has cell receptors for lung cells (it only infects  your lungs). The only way for the virus to infect you is through your  nose or mouth via your hands or an infected cough or sneeze onto or into  your nose or mouth.

2) Stock up now with disposable surgical  masks and use them to prevent you from touching your nose and/or mouth  (We touch our nose/mouth 90X/day without knowing it!). This is the only  way this virus can infect you - it is lung-specific. The mask will not  prevent the virus in a direct sneeze from getting into your nose or  mouth - it is only to keep you from touching your nose or mouth.

 3) Stock up now with hand sanitizers and latex/nitrile gloves (get the  appropriate sizes for your family). The hand sanitizers must be  alcohol-based and greater than 60% alcohol to be effective.

4)  Stock up now with zinc lozenges. These lozenges have been proven to be  effective in blocking coronavirus (and most other viruses) from  multiplying in your throat and nasopharynx. Use as directed several  times each day when you begin to feel ANY ""cold-like"" symptoms  beginning. It is best to lie down and let the lozenge dissolve in the  back of your throat and nasopharynx. Cold-Eeze lozenges is one brand  available, but there are other brands available.

I, as many  others do, hope that this pandemic will be reasonably contained, BUT I  personally do not think it will be. Humans have never seen this  snake-associated virus before and have no internal defense against it.  Tremendous worldwide efforts are being made to understand the molecular  and clinical virology of this virus. Unbelievable molecular knowledge  about the genomics, structure, and virulence of this virus has already  been achieved. BUT, there will be NO drugs or vaccines available this  year to protect us or limit the infection within us. Only symptomatic  support is available.

I hope these personal thoughts will be helpful during this potentially catastrophic pandemic. Good luck to all of us,

James Robb, MD FCAP"

If this doesn't slow down and panic ensues, the fed's going to have to pull another hat trick beyond QE1, even if coronavirus slows down it'll be because of hard quarantine from all countries. Honestly the best thing for the economy might just be people treating this like a bad flu season and just carry on and hope hospital capacity managed, but this means coronavirus isn't slowed at all, damned if you do, damned if you don't, just hope the best for vaccines and kill all the antivaxxers.

TLDR:
This month I began to sell Weekly $SPY Put Spreads as the market was dropping at the big support levels. Sold $320p spread. Then $315p. Then $310p. Then $305p. Then when we neared $300 I deposited money from my bank account and went all in on 2/28 $300p/$299p spread. I firmly believed that $SPY would hold at $300 / SPX at $3000. I had a concrete feeling that there’s no way in hell a little flu from eating a bat would make us rupture a huge support and psychological level. Turns out I was wrong, we dropped through it like butter and I sold one last $298p/$297p to try and recoup some losses because I thought $SPY would be above that on Friday.
I was wrong it dropped to $285 and we closed just below $298. All my put spreads were exercised and I wasn’t able to close out the spreads before expiration because all the Put Options were deep ITM with no liquidity at all. Robinhood gave me a margin call because I used a lot of the Credit received to open up more Put Spreads than the collateral I had allowed me to. I’ve lost $20k since 2018. When I first started I was actively trading the markets and buying calls and puts. I quickly made a 110% return and then lost all my money due to the China trade war. I returned shortly after attempting to sell Options but I still all my money again due to zero risk management and Black Swans like the China trade war, this time the Black Swan was the Coronavirus.
Taking a step back and figuring what I’m going to do next. Please only use money that you can afford to lose. Never ever ever go all into one position or one sector. And never let this affect you as much as it did to me."

>A top federal scientist sounded the alarm about what he feared was contamination in an Atlanta lab where the government made test kits for the coronavirus, according to sources familiar with the situation in Atlanta.

>The Trump administration has ordered an independent investigation of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention lab, and manufacturing of the virus test kits has been moved, the sources said.

>**Why it matters**: At the time the administration is under scrutiny for its early preparations for the virus, the potential problems at the lab became a top internal priority for some officials. But the Trump administration did not talk publicly about the Food and Drug Administration’s specific concerns about the Atlanta lab.

>Senior officials are still not saying exactly what the FDA regulator found at the Atlanta lab.
The CDC lab in Atlanta developed the testing formula for the coronavirus test — which the government says works — and was manufacturing relatively small amounts of testing kits for laboratories around the country. This is where the lab ran into problems, per sources familiar with the situation.

>FDA Commissioner Stephen Hahn said, in a statement to Axios, that government agencies have already worked together to resolve the problems with the coronavirus tests.
“Upon learning about the test issue from CDC, FDA worked with CDC to determine that problems with certain test components were due to a manufacturing issue,” he said. “We worked hand in hand with CDC to resolve the issues with manufacturing. FDA has confidence in the design and current manufacturing of the test that already have and are continuing to be distributed. These tests have passed extensive quality control procedures and will provide the high-level of diagnostic accuracy we need during this coronavirus outbreak.”

>**The big picture**: The FDA says it now has full confidence in the coronavirus diagnostic kit, but a slew of new cases announced over the weekend suggest the virus has spread throughout the country while the U.S. government tested only a narrow subset of the population for it.

>The U.S. government had admitted to problems with its diagnostic tests — which have put the U.S. well behind China and South Korea in doing large-scale testing of the American public for the coronavirus.
The big question: It was not immediately clear if or how possible contamination in the Atlanta lab played a role in delays or problems with testing. Nor was it clear how significant or systemic the contamination concerns may be; whether it was a one-time issue that’s easily resolved, or a broader concern involving protocols, safeguards or leadership.
Behind the scenes: The FDA official who visited the Atlanta lab, Timothy Stenzel, is the director of the Office of In Vitro Diagnostics and Radiological Health.

>About a week ago, when the Secretary of Health and Human Services Alex Azar was under extreme pressure over the delays in getting coronavirus testing kits to market, Stenzel traveled to Atlanta to help troubleshoot whatever technical problems might have been occurring with the tests.

>Stenzel was alarmed by the procedures he witnessed in the Atlanta laboratory and raised concerns with multiple CDC officials, per a source familiar with the situation in Atlanta.
Stenzel is a highly-regarded scientist and diagnostics expert. He was on the ground in Atlanta to deal with technical issues and happened to stumble upon the inappropriate procedures and possible contaminants. He is not a laboratory inspector and thus was not charged with producing an inspection report on the lab conditions.

>But he raised the concerns and they have been taken seriously and risen to the highest levels of the U.S. government.

>On Thursday afternoon, the concerns about the Atlanta laboratory were raised in a conference call that included senior government officials from multiple agencies including the Department of Health and Human Services, the Food and Drug Administration, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and the National Institutes of Health.

>The call’s purpose was to figure out ways to mass produce the testing kits and get them to market quickly.

>The Trump administration says it’s now figured out how to get over those hurdles. An HHS spokesperson promised that by the end of this week, “we will have the capacity to test up to 75,000 individuals” for the coronavirus

>**What's next**: The FDA’s manufacturing concerns — which include the possible contamination of testing kits — have also resulted in the Trump administration ordering an independent investigation of the CDC’s Atlanta laboratory, according to senior officials.

>“HHS has launched an investigation and is assembling a team of non-CDC scientists to better understand the nature and source of the manufacturing defect in the first batch of COVID-19 test kits that were distributed to state health departments and others,” said an HHS spokesperson.

>“HHS/CDC have been transparent with the American people regarding the issue with the manufacturing of the diagnostic and will be transparent with the findings of this investigation.” (But the administration was not transparent about the senior FDA official's concerns about the conditions and procedures in the Atlanta laboratory.)

>A senior administration official added that the government also moved the manufacturing of the coronavirus tests out of the Atlanta laboratory of CDC.

>The official said that the CDC engaged with a third party contractor on Feb. 20 to help manufacture the testing kits. The official added that the FDA regulator, Stenzel, visited the Atlanta laboratory on Feb. 22.

>**Between the lines**: Until Thursday, the CDC’s guidance was to only test Americans for the coronavirus if they’d recently traveled to China — or had close contact with someone known to have the virus — and were symptomatic.

>Under this policy, the CDC initially refused to test a California patient who didn’t fit this criteria but had the coronavirus, although the CDC disputes that it denied doctors’ testing request.

>As of Friday, South Korea had tested 65,000 people for the coronavirus; the U.S. had tested only 459, per Science Magazine. China can reportedly conduct up to 1.6 million tests a week.

>Although the World Health Organization has sent testing kits to 57 other countries, the U.S. decided to make its own.

>There have also been problems with the tests themselves. On Feb. 12, the FDA announced that health labs across the country were having problems validating the CDC's diagnostic test, Science reports in an in-depth account of what went wrong with the tests.

>The FDA announced yesterday that public health labs can create their own diagnostic test. Scott Becker, the CEO of the Association of Public Health Laboratories, told Science that he expects that public health labs will be able to do 10,000 tests a day by the end of the week."

2020-03-01,Bisounoursdestenebre,Animemes,7,https://www.reddit.com/r/Animemes/comments/fbug1u/breaking_news/fj7v4gp/,"First of all, difference with the flue and the cold is that they are well known diseases, and that, although they ARE viruses, they mutate less than the Coronavirus. The nature of the support for genetic information in viruses makes them naturally mutative but it is especially true for Coronavirus (or at least it's what I've heard, albeight it's not my best source).

Second of all, it's a BIG epidemic in China, way more than what they want the rest of the world to know, and it is spreading really quick in a lot of countries. That alone puts it on the WHO watchlist. I live in France (our government reacted... weirdly but that's not the issue here) and it has spread a lot : we are already at 100 cases, wich makes it quite big for such a little span of time.

Third, it's still young : around a month old. That is REALLY scary. It has spread a lot, and in a month we can't really tell the real lethality of the virus. Plus, as said, it can mutate.

Finally, the virus it's still very deadly for elders and young. I don't think people realise what such a REAL epidemic means in countries where most people are old. And I also think people don't realize that the issue is not the death count, but the infected count. It's a new strain, we have no real idea of what it does, and it is spreading A LOT. Multiple countries are loosing control of the diseas and beds are starting to run low.

Yes, in the US it's not really such a big deal but in a lot of countries, people are getting scared for good reason. Of course, we should not panic but stop saying coronavirus is ""just a big flue"" and that ""it's not deadly, so it's fine"".

Remember, HIV never killed anyone.

Edit : said AIDS instead of HIV, wich a big mistake."

&#x200B;

Ten minutes into his remarks about voter suppression and the civil rights movement, about a dozen churchgoers stood up and turned their backs to the candidate, where they silently stayed in place for the duration of the speech.

It was the 55th anniversary of “Bloody Sunday,” when state troopers viciously attacked black civil rights activists who marched over the Edmund Pettus Bridge in Selma.

&#x200B;

Gathered at the Brown Chapel AME Church just blocks away from the bridge, the anti-Bloomberg churchgoers seemed to evoke the legacy of nonviolent protest immortalized on March 7, 1965.

&#x200B;

While they didn’t utter a word, the signal they sent was loud and clear: They don’t want the ex-mayor who once championed stop-and-frisk for president.

&#x200B;

“I have tried to listen and I have tried to learn,” Bloomberg told the congregation, echoing his November apology for the controversial policing tactic. “I certainly gave people the opportunity to change my mind.”

“I think that it’s important for Mr. Bloomberg, Mayor Bloomberg, to hear from you, listen to you, to learn from you,” Reverend Leodis Strong said in introducing the former mayor.

&#x200B;

Former Vice President Joe Biden had also been scheduled to speak at the church. The attendees included Jesse Jackson and Rev. Al Sharpton.

The ex-veep and Bloomberg have split the endorsements of Alabama’s leading political groups between them. While black voters helped Biden to a landslide victory Saturday in South Carolina’s primary, Bloomberg has struggled to win over the demographic.

&#x200B;

Before making a late entrance into the presidential race, Bloomberg took to a predominantly black megachurch in Brooklyn to apologize for his handling of stop-and-frisk, in which officers empowered to search people suspected of illegal activity disproportionately targeted blacks and Latinos.

&#x200B;

His track record as mayor from 2002 to 2013 has defined his presidential run, with black leaders sharply divided over his legacy.

Super Tuesday, in which 14 states hold Democratic primaries, represents a moment of truth for Bloomberg. After sitting out the first four contests, in which Biden and Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) came out on top, the media mogul is polling around the middle of the pack in the biggest states. He came in with support from 12% of likely primary voters in California, according to a CBS News Battleground Tracker/YouGov poll, behind Sanders, who had 31%, Biden at 19% and Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) with 18%.

&#x200B;

In Texas, Sanders polled at 34%, Biden at 19% and Bloomberg at 15%, according to a CBS News Battleground Tracker/YouGov poll out Sunday.

&#x200B;

Bloomberg’s campaign did not provide comment about the silent protest.

> Author Dean Koontz has been hailed throughout his long career for his works, which have included suspense thrillers, horror, science fiction and other genres.

> But recently, he has attracted attention — at least in some quarters — as a prophet.

> The Bedford County native, 74, who now lives in California, has climbed the list of most-searched topics on the internet, and been lighting up social media sites, after readers noted similarities — striking on the surface — between the plot of Koontz’s 1981 thriller “The Eyes of Darkness” and the coronavirus dubbed COVID-19 that appeared in China. The virus has spread across the globe, infecting more than 75,000 people in China, with more than 2,000 deaths attributed to the illness, which first came to the attention of the world in the city of Wuhan.

> Particularly eye-catching was this quote from the book:

> “They call the stuff “Wuhan-400” because it was developed at their RDNA labs outside of the city of Wuhan and it was the four-hundredth viable strain of man-made microorganisms created at that research centre.”

> Perhaps making the quote even more chilling is the real-life existence of a high-level bio-research lab, the Wuhan Institute of Virology.

> The eerie coincidence has taken flight worldwide.

> The issue was even raised by Sen Tom Cotton, R-Ark., who in an interview voiced the possibility that the virus had been manufactured by Chinese authorities.

> “Author Dean Koontz eerily predicted the coronavirus outbreak in his 1981 thriller ‘The Eyes of Darkness,’ ” a post on the Fox News website reads.

> Later, “the coincidence between the book’s virus and the actual coronavirus outbreak is uncanny.”

> Among media outlets doing stories or postings on “The Eyes of Darkness” similarities are The New York Times, Business Mirror, The Week, The Weather Channel, ABS-CBN and the Derry Journal (Northern Ireland). Interest seems particularly acute in India, where The New Indian Express, Times of India, One India, indiablooms and Nagaland Post have all addressed the topic.

> Comparisons between the book and the coronavirus outbreak have been rampant on social media sites.

> There is only one problem, of course: It’s all a coincidence.

> The internet site snopes.com notes that, “Dean Koontz did not predict an outbreak of a new coronavirus. Other than the name (Wuhan-400), this fictional biological weapon has little in common with the virus that caused an outbreak in 2020.”

> Among other significant disparities, snopes notes:

> • In Koontz’s novel, “Wuhan-400” is a human-made weapon. The coronavirus, on the other hand, was not.

> • In the novel, “Wuhan-400” has a 100% fatality rate. While researchers are still learning about the coronavirus, the current fatality rate sits at about 2%.

> • The fictional “Wuhan-400” has an extremely quick incubation period of about four hours, compared to COVID-19 which has an incubation period between two and 14 days.

> Indeed, snopes points out that in the original version, released by Koontz in 1981 under the pen name Leigh Nichols, the virus originates in Gorky, Russia, and is called Gorky 400. It is not until a 2008 re-release under Koontz’ own name that the virus’s origins are moved to Wuhan.

> One person who has not addressed the uproar over the coincidence is Koontz, who has been silent about the topic on his social media accounts.

> Attempts to reach him by telephone on Wednesday were not successful."

There have been a total of 698 negative test results in the country before the patient was diagnosed.

According to Scottish and UK protocol all patients presenting with a history and symptoms which may be suggestive of coronavirus will be isolated and appropriate infection prevention and control measures put in place.

First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has chaired a meeting of the Scottish Government Resilience Committee (SGoRR) this evening and will be taking part in the UK Government’s resilience (COBR) meeting chaired by the Prime Minister tomorrow morning to ensure all necessary steps are being taken to prepare for further expected cases in Scotland.

Ms Sturgeon said: “Our first thoughts must be with the patient diagnosed with coronavirus, I wish them a speedy recovery.

“Scotland is well-prepared for a significant outbreak of coronavirus but there is currently no treatment or vaccine. Early detection measures will continue to be vital in helping to prevent the spread of the virus.”

Maybe, but conisder that the WHO believes that the coronavirus epidemic likely peaked in China in late January or early February and that the number of people with confirmed cases of coronavirus in China is falling fast.

2020-03-01,JurjAlex,Permaculture,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/Permaculture/comments/fbzihj/pollution_in_china_before_and_after_coronavirus/fj7nj1l/," NASA and the European Space Agency's pollution monitoring satellites have detected a significant decline in the amount of nitrogen dioxide (NO2) — a noxious gas emitted by cars, power plants and factories.

""There is evidence that the change is at least partly related to the economic slowdown following the outbreak of coronavirus,"" NASA said in a statement.

According to NASA, the reduction in NO2 was first apparent near Wuhan, the epicentre of the virus, where millions of people were quarantined.

""This is the first time I have seen such a dramatic drop-off over such a wide area for a specific event,"" research scientist Dr Fei Liu said.

The drop in pollution also coincided with the Lunar New Year, when most businesses in China close.

""There is always this general slowdown around this time of the year,"" NASA air quality scientist Barry Lefer said.

But NASA's Earth Observatory said that: ""While the Lunar New Year may have played a role in the recent drop-off, researchers believe the decrease is more than a holiday effect or weather-related variation.""

It noted that pollution levels had not risen as expected after the New Year holiday.

NASA has been collecting global data on NO2 and various air pollutants for more than 15 years.

This is not the first time decreases have been recorded in China.

""Scientists also observed a significant reduction around Beijing during the 2008 Olympics, but the effect was mostly localised around that city, and pollution levels rose again once the Olympics ended,"" NASA said.

I know we technically have really high quality healthcare in the United States, it's just that it's ludicrously expensive and often out of reach of people. Even with insurance, and insurance itself is such an insane mess to deal with. People often aren't going to get tested or even go to the hospital when they have symptoms because it could likely cost them a fortune, and a huge portion of Americans can't even afford an unexpected expense of a few hundred dollars.

On top of that, people are going to be afraid of getting fired for missing work, so they won't self-quarantine. This seems like a recipe for disaster to me.

The coronavirus is in the same family as the common cold. The only people the coronavirus really hurts are those with compromised immune systems or those who are old. The coronavirus is not a consistently strong disease, just a fast spreading one. There have been many cases where people have been asymptomatic. Will classes be cancelled in an outbreak? Yeah probably. Many of the professors are older and it would be bad to not only lose your brightest minds, but also have to deal with a mass campus infection. Will most people be fine? Yeah. You'll probably see a 14 to 21 day quarantine/shutdown period followed by decontamination and evacuation of the older professors to hospitals for treatment if nessecary. You'll still be provided food, and you'll still have water. You'll just be in quarantine. For those off campus theyd probably get checked as well. The reason why in South Korea or China it's so serious is because there are millions of people clustered together in tiny spaces. High population density. In the US, especially Texas, we dont have that kind of issue in most places except major, major urban cities like San Francisco, LA, or New York.

This method is wrong. If it takes, for example, 10 days to go from infected to dead, then you should take the number of fatalities and divide that by the number of infected from 10 days earlier, not the number from the same day."

Bear markets and market corrections (where prices drop between 10-20%) are fairly common and happen ever so often; the key is to not panic and sell. The trading market for large, market-dominating companies like Disney, Apple, Microsoft, etc. will always be strong. People seem to forget that before the Coronavirus effect (about two weeks), the Dow Jones, S&P 500, NASDAQ, and other indexes were having historic growth runs over the past year. The markets were looking for a reason for a price correction. I'd imagine prices will return to pre-Coronavirus levels within a few months. Everything in finance runs on cycles; you can't have a period of extreme growth without periods of bad returns as well. 

If your a short seller, now is still a good opportunity since the prices on high-volume equities like Disney will continue to decrease some more. If you have a long position holding strategy, now is a great time to buy before the market swings upwards again."

You don’t need to feel guilt or shame on top of your fear. Your fear is valid, and (I don’t remember if I said this to you or someone else) stacking additional, unnecessary emotions on top of the necessary ones will just compound your problems and make everything significantly worse. Take these feelings one at a time and offload whatever is unnecessary. 

Anyways, I don’t think anyone here is sugar-coating anything, I think we’re being realistic and not hyperbolic. If you search for opposite information, you’re going to find it simply because there’s *so much information* out there, you know? *Right now,* there’s very little to fear. That’s coming from everyone’s primary care physicians, leading epidemiologists, the CDC, WHO, government officials, all credible sources are saying extremely similar things. 

Stop looking stuff up, buddy, you’re just going to drive yourself crazy. I promise you that whatever angle you’re coming from, you will find at least *something* to back up whatever claim you’re trying to make. Take the word of the most credited people and avoid everything else. I linked you the most credible people I could find above, and I will find more if you want it. After a certain point, you are doing this to yourself.

I just went over this in a work group chat. America has 2.77 beds available per 1000 people (as of 2016). I know there are more places then America, but just because I just did this, I'll use it as an example.

If we go with conservative numbers for things. 20% of the total population gets infected, 15% of those need hospitalization to overcome it, and let's say half of people who should get hospitalization don't go.

(((1000*.25) *.15) *.5) = 19 (can't have 3/4 of a person)

That means we would need 19 beds available, and the distribution of beds to population isn't even. Some places would have more then 2.77 beds per 1000, some less.

There is also speculation of either reinfection or a dormancy period (like Mononucleosis). Because there have been about 14% of people who have been recovered, cleared, and gone home who still tested positive for sars-cov-2. It's unknown if they were still sloughing off active virus at this time. China has started to re-quarantine people who they previously thought of as recovered. 

As people either don't go to the hospital that should, or aren't able to find needed medical care (regardless of cost) the quality and quantity of people that die will rise. 

And we are in the incubation period for many people. It's running from 2 days to 14 in most cases, the whole time these people are sloughing off virus.

The R^0 of 4 and *much* higher have been speculated by Los Alamos and a French doctor that worked with SARS (also a coronavirus type). Which means that it will/can travel further and farther then the flu with a R^0 of below 2. 

All that to say, no memeing, this is far more serious then the flu for vulnerable populations.

I just also found out that the US has 116,000 respirators nationwide available. One of the biggest things needed for those hospitalized is exactly that.

Hand, mouth, and foot disease is ranging through schools and I had three kids with it that I had close contact with due to work. 

My point is there is probably a lot of illnesses, bacteria, fungus, and viruses that you are exposed to. Don't sweat about the coronavirus just do what the doctors always recommend: wash your hands, don't touch your nose, eyes, or mouth, get updated vaccines if you can, and wear masks when in areas with high populations or around hospitals if you can.

With all due respect, you shouldn’t be selling put spreads when there’s all this uncertainty regarding the coronavirus.  Odds are the market will go down rather than up right now.  If you use odds in your favor selling premium is a great way to earn income, but when you are selling premium against the trend thinking it can’t go any lower or higher you are bound to lose.  The market will keep going down when things are really bad until there is something to cause it to go up again.  Similarly the market will keep going up until something causes it to go down.  I think you are losing money not because of a bad method, but because of poor execution and poor judgement.  I think that you shouldn’t give up, but maybe practice a bit more with paper trading until you understand more how the market works and find a strategy that works for you. Also just wanted to add that you never want to put all your eggs in one basket.  Part of the reason you’re losing so often is because you are putting all of your money on one trade instead of spreading it out over a few.  Diversification is always important no matter how sure you think you are of something."

1. Surge numbers in hospitals.  Surge capacity in disasters is crushing, and numbers far beyond a bad flu season Saturday.  Pray you catch it soon while your nurses have still had sleep.
2. The collapse of the retail, non-internet economy.  No way people are going out in public in two weeks.  Forget all big events of any kind by the end of this week.
3. Right now as I read stories, production resumes in affected areas in China, the questions become deep: who drives the product? (no drivers)  To where? (can I even get to the port which might be shipping and to where?)  To do what with it? (no one will be where this arrives to make this into anything)  To sell to who??? (who in the world is buying non essentials over the next month, and forget luxury items).
4. The psychological toll of increasing death and infection numbers in the millions.  I always feared the most insane scenario of us eventually hitting numbers past SARS.  We already did, and this is just beginning.  If Hhundreds of thousands of cases are showing up throughout the world this week \*\* then thisis the sign above all you need to splash iceberg-tier water on your face\*\* as those numbers instantly turn into utter global catastrophe.
5. Even if the outbreak is mystically somehow only half-terrible, we are looking dead square at severe political instability, borders closing, emergency service personnel getting quarantined (e.g. the firefighters case that just occurred is very telling).

People attempt to compare this to market over-excitement and numbers issues causing past corrections.  Lol.  Denial.  This is not the mis-pricing of some housing bundles. Think of the trivial stuff that caused past recessions.  Possibly depressions.  Numbers and money games.

This is a bit more akin to a meteor being present in the sky, clearly heading at our face, and NASA saying 'it is nothing to worry about since ""it is not that big, just the size of 2-3 texas, and it is getting smaller, and we have the best meteor absorbing atmosphere.  I think ever.  Meteors hit us all the time.""

If the world started a stunning, A-game global response to this tomorrow, there would be a real reason for hope.  There would be light at the end of a \*very\* inconvenient tunnel.  But few, if any, countries are prepared to act with the swift lockdown and mega-scale construction China achieved.  They had people standing outside of each apartment complex and on every block enforcing travel and quarantine.   Areas without party-enforcement mechanisms were paying hard-cash to neighbors to report on each other.  That is what it takes to beat this.

In summary, take the few data points we have and get the balls to draw a line through them.  It plummets straight down.  So, enjoy profiting off the market fall this week.  (Monday could rally, but the market is a dead-crimson-black by open on Tuesday about 8 days from now)

Spend every dollar (or at least 40%) that you make tomorrow on Tuesday and Wednesday on useful material items.  Immediately.  If you can get them.  As money being worth something will be the larger issue.

I dare you to have the balls to read every single post on r/Coronavirus for the next two hours until the on-the-ground reality sets in.  There is no end in sight.

We have people scheduled to come in from South Korea, Japan, Italy, as well as from all over the United States. 

My employer is moving forward as though all is well, and I just don’t buy it. We’ve seen major corporations cancel conferences. I doubt any of these overseas folks will be able to get flights anyway. Not to mention, before all this corona mania began, 211 million gallons of sewage spilled into the streets of Ft. Lauderdale, contaminating all of the waterways and drinking water in the area. 

The whole conference of ours just seems like a terrible idea. I’m wondering if workers who refuse to attend conferences like these might be protected under OSHA guidelines. OSHA says:

“Your right to refuse to do a task is protected if all of the following conditions are met:

Where possible, you have asked the employer to eliminate the danger, and the employer failed to do so; and

You refused to work in ""good faith."" This means that you must genuinely believe that an imminent danger exists; and

A reasonable person would agree that there is a real danger of death or serious injury; and

There isn't enough time, due to the urgency of the hazard, to get it corrected through regular enforcement channels, such as requesting an OSHA inspection.

You should take the following steps:

Ask your employer to correct the hazard, or to assign other work;

Tell your employer that you won't perform the work unless and until the hazard is corrected; and Remain at the worksite until ordered to leave by your employer.”

Seems like I’d be well within my rights to refuse to attend this conference, based on OSHA guidelines. 

The problem is, I’m the guy who makes the entire thing happen... audio/video etc. They’ll crucify me if I say I won’t go. But they should cancel it in their own!

Any thoughts about how folks might be able to invoke OSHAs right to refuse work in light of the Coronavirus outbreaks going on?"

There are however two main reasons for why I think this is mother nature fucking with us, helped by our own greed and stupidity but not by our intelligent design:

**The first reason** is that bioweapons are something the COVID-19 is **not**: controllable, predictable and incapacitating. You want your weapon to go in the direction you point it, when you point it and to effect the people you point it at. The COVID-19 goes all over the place, is sure to hit your own population as badly as your enemies, and incapacitates mostly people too old or sick to be a part of active military while leaving almost all healthy soldiers with a case of the sniffles.

Sure, it could be a pure anarchy terror thing, but then we are over in sort of cartoon villain territory or some pretty rare combinations of motivation and ability. Especially since this is after all a bad influenza, not the end of the world. It will mess things up and make a lot of people grieve their grandparents years earlier than they otherwise would have to, but it is not an apocalypse unless we insist on making it so. 

A good weapon it is not. 

**The second reason** is that that explanation is completely unnecessary. The COVID-19 virus does exactly what coronaviruses do, it emerged from an area [my colleagues have been pointing to as a likely hotspot for emerging viruses for literally over a decade](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature06536) -it is just that Chinese authorities have chosen to ignore our warnings for year after year. The DNA sequence of COVID-19 [has been sequenced fully and made openly available](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2008-3.), and there is nothing in it that we would not expect to see in a naturally occurring coronavirus of its type. If someone engineered this they probably didn't even have to -it looks like coronaviruses do.

We have been fortunate for so long that many of us have forgotten what nature does. We have forgotten that infectious diseases are a thing that used to have huge impacts on human populations. Somehow started to think simple things like disease is beneath us and can only hurt us when some nefarious will is behind it. This is not the case. With increasing population densities, pollution and poor nutrition damaging immune systems of poor people and instant global travel we are vulnerable to chance, charlatans and lack of preparedness and available health care. And we will be again if we don't learn from this.

So claiming it is engineered doesn't really explain anything, it isn't needed to explain something that looks exactly like a natural event we even have been expecting for decades. If it was an avalanche, maybe we could look for someone who caused it, but as long as we have had people pointing to a looming snow drift building up for months we probably don't have to and should probably rather look at the people who ignored those warnings..."

I think the main issue is that the devs don’t properly communicate any of this to us on their own accord. You meant to have 2 battlepasses within a season? Announce it explicitly and consistently through all your social media handles. Your company is being affected by the coronavirus? Notify your players and explain to them how you are affected; most people don’t understand how public health and business mingle. It seems that most of the upset players are on Global; Garena has been praised for effectively communicating with its players through detailed updates and intended leaks in addition to rewarding them with better chances at desirable skins. 

I can say for a fact that the Global version uses a lot of “while we can’t say for sure yet,” “it didn’t work out like we intended,” “we did not mean for this to be as hyped up as it was,” “we do not have an actual date yet” ...This is all passive communication and conveys disarray and lack of initiative within the developers’ system. If something major is affecting your company, just tell us. The world is bigger than a game. 

I can’t sympathize with f2p players essentially demanding paid content, but I agree with those who are angry with the lack of effective communication and proper updates to game mechanics (new paid skins dropping like hot cakes while gameplay is getting less smooth as the seasons go by).

Just my thoughts as of now. Overall, I still enjoy the game, but the devs are walking a very fine line right now"

I think money should be  accessible - at least a portion of it... because there will be a lot of expenses when the time comes. Insurance might take time to payout - so at least for the first few weeks / months, there should be a healthy cash balance. Markets are going to be rocky until Coronavirus settles down - so whatever money you invest will fluctutate wildly - you probably can't depend on the market in the near term as a short-term savings vehicle.

Also, you should involve your wife to be part of the planning so that she knows where all the money is going and where it is - that way she'll be well prepared to take on the money. If she's not interested, you probably have to make her interested for her sake.

In the meantime, you may want to get all the paperwork sorted out - wills, account numbers, passwords, etc. all written down so it's all prepared for your family.

Beyond this, not much more to offer you ... except best of luck and hopefully there is something beyond the great unknown."

Here are the things I got out of it, and a link to the report:

\- About 15% of people who are diagnosed with the virus need to breathe concentrated oxygen, and as much as 5% need to be intubated. This appears to be a much higher rate than we see with the standard flu, likely because humans don't yet have any immune system memory/defense for this novel virus.

\- The mortality rates are quite low for young people, but still several times higher than a standard flu. The rates go up appreciably, however, when there are not enough care providers/resources available to provide the medical support needed for that critical 15%.

\- People needing medical support for COVID-19 typically need care for 3-6 weeks, much longer than the standard flu.

\- Vulnerable people (elderly and the infirm) are the most susceptible to serious infection.

\- The best chance at community resilience lies in ""flattening the curve"", or slowing the spread of infection so that fewer people are sick at once. This reduces the load on healthcare providers already somewhat stressed by this year's flu, and it gives our communities time to prepare and respond appropriately.

\- For all the reasons above, some governments are choosing to take strong measures that reduce community spread. The less frequently we need to go out into the community during the time of concern, the less exposed our vulnerable community members are to outbreaks.

There are several things that could contribute to shortages. Not least among them is supply chain disruptions, which we have yet to see in full force. Economists project that we will start seeing some of these in mid-March. This may have huge impacts on pharmaceuticals, car parts, food containers, all kinds of things...  


[https://hbr.org/2020/02/how-coronavirus-could-impact-the-global-supply-chain-by-mid-march](https://hbr.org/2020/02/how-coronavirus-could-impact-the-global-supply-chain-by-mid-march)

One final thought: we live in an area prone to serious earthquakes, fires, and weather events. Everyone should have a month of medications and at least a couple weeks of food and water in storage. This can increase resilience for our entire community.  At the very least, perhaps this is an opportunity to get prepared for all emergency events. If you haven't prepared yet, no time like the present!  Get your oil changed and your tires replaced, if needed. Get your teeth cleaned and make sure your vaccinations are up to date. Buy those spare bike parts you've been meaning to get.

[https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/observations/preparing-for-coronavirus-to-strike-the-u-s/](https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/observations/preparing-for-coronavirus-to-strike-the-u-s/)

*V sauce intro plays*

This is a pandemic, as the first viral spread of the coronavirus, SARS, infected 8,000 people and killed around 700. MERS, which I believe became viral was transferred from camels to humans, in the Middle East. MERS has infected 2,494 people according to [WHO](https://www.who.int/emergencies/mers-cov/en/) and has killed 858 people. The new strand of coronavirus we are dealing with right now has infected 10 times the amount of people that were infected with the first viral outbreak of a coronavirus strand. (SARS.) and despite it having a low death rate, if it were to infect everybody, it will affect the life expectancy rate globally, basically bringing us back to the 1800s where the global life expectancy was around [30-40 years of age.](https://www.verywellhealth.com/longevity-throughout-history-2224054) Also, not to really scare you but just because there’s a low death rate doesn’t mean that you can avoid dying from this. If there was a zero percent chance of death, then yeah. Nobody would die. But even if there is a one percent chance, that could apply to you. You could be the one percent."

That means that the treatments being used in China/JapanS.Korea, like antivirals/chloroquine, are to be used with the discretion of the doctor in charge, or likely not used at all.

The WHO's website doesn't even include antivirals/chloroquine as potential treatment options. However, the WHO has a booklet on [Guidance on Ethical issues During Infectious Disease Outbreaks](https://www.who.int/ethics/publications/infectious-disease-outbreaks/en/) Where it states that unapproved treatments can be used if they have been ""suggested by an appropriately qualified scientific advisory committee on the basis of a favourable risk–benefit analysis.""(page 39) It also has to be approved by the country first.

This is alarming because it's up to the government to decide if and when it wants to dispense treatment. I think we need to follow S.Korea's lead with making testing available to everyone and to speed up the test/diagnosis process.

The patient, a woman in her 30s, is not in serious condition and has been monitored since arriving back in New York, Gov. Andrew Cuomo (D) said in a statement. He added that the general risk of contracting the virus in the state remains low.
This is a developing story. It will be updated.
The novel coronavirus has probably been spreading undetected for about six weeks in Washington state, where the first U.S. death was reported this weekend. A genetic analysis suggests that the cases are linked through community transmission and that this has been going on for weeks, with hundreds of infections likely in the state.
Two new cases were confirmed in Washington state’s King County on Sunday, bringing that state’s total to eight. Rhode Island also announced its first probable case. If confirmed, it will be the second on the East Coast, after a previously announced case in Massachusetts. The Rhode Island patient is in his 40s and had traveled to Europe in mid-February.
The global death toll is climbing toward 3,000 on four continents. The first U.S. death, in Washington state, was man in his 50s with underlying health conditions, officials said. The patient had no recent travel history or contact with people known to be infected, officials said.
Officials in the Seattle area are monitoring a possibly outbreak at a long-term nursing home. The elderly are considered to be especially vulnerable to infection. One patient is a health-care worker in her 40s who was in satisfactory condition, according to state health officials. The other, a resident in her 70s, is in serious condition.
Earlier Saturday, the Trump administration outlined new travel restrictions affecting Iran, Italy and South Korea in response to the outbreak, and President Trump said he was considering further restrictions across the southern border.
Here are the latest developments:
Two new cases were confirmed in Washington state in King County on Sunday, bringing that state’s total to eight. Rhode Island also announced its first probable case.
As cases mounted, the White House scrambled to gain control of a rudderless response defined by bureaucratic infighting, confusion and misinformation. “It’s complete chaos,” one senior administration official said.
Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar said Sunday that the administration is watching for possible drug shortages from disruptions to the pharmaceutical supply chain in China.
New cases have been announced in the Middle East as governments there try to control the spread.
The FDA expanded coronavirus testing by speeding up hospitals’ abilities to test, though some worried that the changes fell short. The number of confirmed cases is likely to increase given the expansion in testing."

I would bet that at least some of those cases are actually coronavirus.  Its not like they even routinely test for flu- its just if someone dies with flu-like symptoms(which is identical to coronavirus) the healthcare workers just assume it is flu and document it as such.

&#x200B;

The low number in the US I bet are primarily due to the low testing rates as you say.  They were only testing people with travel history to china or contact with someone from Wuhan.  They just started allowing testing with better kits at more institutions with a more broad criteria, so the numbers are going to skyrocket this week.

2020-03-01,protissniper0,funny,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/funny/comments/fc064t/intresting/fj8enm3/,"That percentage from closed cases is massively inflated due to several factors and it's dropping every single day. You can check the entire graph with the history from the case tracker I linked below. Early on into the outbreak it was 60%+, it has been dropping every single day. Feb 02 it was 41%, Feb 10 it was 20%, Feb 21 it was 10%, today it's 6%. It will keep plummeting until it reaches a more accurate number. The reason the death rate from closed cases is very much NOT the actual chance of death if you get the infection:

1. Those who die do that noticeably quicker than those who recover. That means the deaths curve is ahead of the recovered curve. Early on into the outbreak the deaths may even outnumber the recovered count. But at some point the recovered overtake the deaths and race past. This is exactly what we have observed and it is happening at an accelerated rate. You can see the evolution of the closed cases death rate in the closed cases box here (click on ""show graph""):  [https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/](https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/) . Based on other studies this number will likely drop to somewhere around 2-3%.
2. The numbers everybody is talking about are CASE fatality rates. That is, we are talking about chance of death if tested positive. Some studies have tried to estimate which percentage of actual infections get detected. One based on Japanese data found that 91% of cases likely go undetected. That is because the people who get tested are the ones who get most sick, go to the hospital or call the ambulance. The asymptomatic cases and mild cases generally go untested and undetected and these are the vast majority. Due to this some of the latest INFECTION fatality rate estimates (taking into account undetected cases) are somewhere in the range of 0.6-0.9%.

A quick calculation, assuming 60% of the world's population gets infected and that infection mortality is 0.75% yields us total death count of 35 million worldwide. Which is twice as much as die every year from infectious diseases worldwide."

The coronavirus is spreading worldwide and more and more cases are also becoming known in Germany. In Berlin, for the first time a patient has been diagnosed with the disease. This means that there are now confirmed infections in 10 of the 16 German states. This was announced late Sunday evening by the Senate Department for Health, Care and Equality.

&#x200B;

Concrete information is still scarce. The person will be isolated and treated in hospital. The public health officer in charge has begun tracking down the contact persons.

&#x200B;

Health Senator Dilek Kalayci will inform the press about the case and further proceedings on Monday at 12 noon, it was said. More details were not disclosed by the senate administration upon request late Sunday evening.

&#x200B;

In Germany, more than 130 infections with the virus Sars-CoV-2, which can cause the lung disease Covid-19, are known so far. Results were expected on Monday by employees of the Brandenburg adventure pool Tropical Islands. A man from North Rhine-Westphalia visited the site, where the pathogen was later detected.

&#x200B;

In Baden-Wuerttemberg, four more infections were confirmed late Sunday evening, bringing the number to 20. The Mannheim Health Office reported three cases. In addition, the Heilbronn Health Office reported another confirmed COVID-19 case.

&#x200B;

The virus spreads by droplet infection, for example when coughing and speaking. The origin of the novel virus is in China. According to a recent analysis presented by China's health authority, 2.3 percent of those infected with sars-CoV-2 die there, including mainly elderly people with pre-existing conditions.

&#x200B;

Italy reports more deaths - but wants to reopen schools

In Europe, Italy is the country worst affected by the epidemic. The number of deaths there rose to 34, according to civil defence chief Angelo Borrelli on Sunday in Rome. That was five more deaths than the day before. In the meantime, according to him, 1694 people are infected with the Sars-CoV-2 pathogen. Of these, 83 have already recovered. The total number had soared to 1128 people on Saturday.

&#x200B;

Despite the continuing strong increase in numbers, the first regions want to reopen their schools starting Monday. The students in the three hardest hit regions - in Lombardy, Emilia-Romagna and Veneto - are to stay at home - at least for another week. The cathedral in Milan should also reopen for visitors on Monday.

Mass events begin today in Valencia with the first 'masclet' and the 'Crida' without restrictions being established despite the 13 contagions detected in the city

Nothing. No restrictions, no recommendations, no notices of any kind. The Fallas of 2020, one of the Spanish festivities that concentrates more public in its acts (which extend throughout the month of March), starts today its official calendar without the authorities having issued any kind of protocol to prevent the expansion of the coronavirus.

""We will establish the necessary measures that are currently zero."" The mayor of Valencia, Joan Ribó,was trying to reassure a population that was facing the first contagion of the virus last week before diving into the first mass falleros acts. Since then, the confirmed cases have risen to 15 (13 of them in the city), but the policy of the Valencian administrations in this regard has not changed one iota: there is no reason for the alarm, they insist.

And the message seems to have been drawn among the population. The night 'masclet' that was held yesterday in the Marina gathered thousands of Valencians in the port precinct and the 'macroaa"" of this morning through the streets of central Valencia has not reduced its traditional influx, confirm both the councilor of Festiva Culture, Carlos Galiana,and the president of Interununción Fallera, Guillermo Serrano, Guillermo Serrano.

But the real test of how coronavirus syndrome affects the Fallas has to be seen in two of the official acts that accumulate the most attendance historically at the beginning of the festivities: the first 'masclet' in the Plaza del Ayuntamiento and the 'Crida' in the Torres de Serranos. ""The 'Crida' can be quietly unless the health authorities say otherwise,"" said Galiana, who noted that ""everything to do"" with Covid-19 ""will have to be said by the Ministry and the Ministry of Health."".

And the response of the Valencians has been overwhelming in the first of the mass events: thousands of people have huddled in the Town Hall square to enjoy the first 'masclet' of the Fallas of 2020 making it clear that there is no widespread panic to the spread of coronavirus in the city despite recorded cases.

The mayor has also made a reference to this situation and highlighted normality in a massive event in which not a single mask has been seen (just one in the surrounding area). ""Weare working a lot to make people safe, but at the same time that there is no sense of panic because it is a situation that does not help. I call again for peace of mind. We will follow the orders of the Ministry of Health and the Ministry of Health, who have not yet told us anything. Peace of mind because the Fallas can run without any problems,"" he said at the end of the shooting.

While other countries such as Switzerland and France have restricted acts that may result in the presence of several thousand people, the Spanish health authorities have decided to wait for the evolution of contagions to determine whether restrictive measures are applied.

Fernando Simón,director of the Centre for the Coordination of Health Alerts and Emergencies of the Ministry of Health, has in fact emphasized several times during his interventions to explain the evolution of the virus in Spain that do not give the conditions to impose limits on the holding of mass acts such as the Fallas. Simon, however, has reserved himself the possibility of extraordinary measures if cases of contagion are overflowing.

If there is no explicit directive from the Ministry of Health, the City Council will keep all the acts scheduled for faults to which the alarm for the coronavirus that spreads throughout Spain threatens to leave its tourist records under minimums. Visitor numbers were already expected to be lower than on previous occasions when the big days of the holidays do not coincide on weekends, but the panic at coronavirus can be a fatal blow to the restoration and the hotel sector, which usually fill the box during the falleras."

Question for you, OP. The world is currently experiencing a particularly slippery variety of SARS, I think. This little plague seems to have adapted to countermeasures with some cleverness. The thing's got a gestation of a week or ten days, so it can be all over the place already when people start getting noticeably sick. It also either doesn't produce countermeasures by the body, or delays them long enough that people who have gotten better can be re-infected with remarkable alacrity.

It's like the damned thing knows how we go about counteracting these outbreaks. And it's a weak virus, not as virulent and deadly as SARS. Like it's a test strain.

The rumor has been swirling around that Coronavirus escaped from a Chinese Bio-warfare lab. The whole thing seems intelligently engineered to spread quickly, and virus's don't know how to be clever. Humans do.

So, is this theory plausible to you? I'll understand if you don't want to respond."

You heard wrong about SARS. the SARS issue lasted a 6 month span and totaled around 8700 total cases. This suprassed that in a week. The total cases are over 80,000 and now on every continent. If the same amount of people get the virus as do get the flu, say goodbye to alot of grandmas and grandpas prematurely. SARS did not last long because the death rate was too high. An effective virus shouldn't kill its host, because it wants to spread to new victims. 2.5 percent of people that get it will die. 15 percent of all victims will get pneumonia. Mmm yay, i'd love some pneumonia this year. How about you????"

2020-03-01,UnZaneTrader,wallstreetbets,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fbzzu9/no_more_uni/fj7o90y/,"A team from the University of Rochester Medical Center gathered in late February for a drill: What would the hospital do if someone showed up presenting with symptoms of the disease caused by the novel coronavirus?

The group went through the steps: Masks on. Get the patient into an isolation room. Rule out other possible causes. Notify county and state health officials.

Now, the student health center is setting up a similar planning session.


There have been no suspected cases of Covid-19, the illness caused by the virus, at the University of Rochester. But the school, with more than 12,000 students in western New York state, knows it might not stay that way.

“We need to really get on top of things early,” said Dr. Ralph Manchester, vice provost and director of University Health Service, the student health center.

Colleges and universities across the U.S. are updating pandemic protocols in anticipation of potential widespread outbreaks of the fast-moving virus. They have a unique challenge that can’t be addressed by setting work-from-home policies, the way companies can. On campuses, thousands of students live in close quarters, with communal bathrooms and dining facilities.

Schools look far different than they did during the H1N1 flu pandemic in 2009. The college student population has grown more diverse and mobile in the past decade, and faculty have more research relationships with counterparts in far-flung regions. That means plenty of people with recent travel to, or other connections with, China, South Korea, Europe and elsewhere.

SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS

What is the conversation on your college campus like around the topic of coronavirus? Join the conversation below.

Colleges say they are following guidelines established by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, including recommending 14-day self-isolation for individuals who may have been exposed.

Four students at three schools in the Los Rios Community College District around Sacramento are in isolation, after being exposed to an individual who tested positive in northern California. The University of California, Davis, said Saturday evening it had released three students—one being tested, and that person’s roommates—from isolation after the results came back negative for the virus.


The American College Health Association, an organization of campus health programs at more than 1,100 institutions, created a task force on the virus 10 days ago. “And it is as if we have been shot out of a cannon since then,” said Dr. Jean Chin, an associate clinical professor of medicine at the University of Georgia who is chairing the new group.

The team is reviewing guidelines from the CDC, World Health Organization, the U.S. State Department and other authorities, distilling medical literature into digestible advisories for campus communities and establishing guidelines to help members prepare for the disease.

The University of Rochester established a Coronavirus University Response Team in February, looking at everything from emergency response and public health to addressing possible xenophobia, monitoring international travel and planning for the potential impact on applications and enrollment.

The University of Colorado Boulder created a pandemic section for its emergency operations plan in 2015, and one for infectious disease a year later. The guidelines lay out things like how to coordinate with local health officials and various containment measures once a threat has been identified. The campus has roughly 35,500 students.

Decisions such as halting campus operations would depend on how many cases were confirmed and where the affected people live, said Dan Jones, Boulder’s associate vice chancellor for integrity, safety and compliance.


Some schools don’t have to dust off their doomsday guides because they have recently battled contagious diseases. Syracuse University had dozens of confirmed cases of mumps in late 2017 and had to coordinate closely with the CDC and county and state health departments.

A few years ago, Rochester had roughly 200 reported cases of norovirus, whose symptoms include vomiting and diarrhea. Dr. Manchester said there were likely closer to 1,000 people affected.

The last six weeks of spring semester that year, the university was in “all-out ‘control-this-outbreak’ mode,” Dr. Manchester said. The school stepped up regular cleaning services, switched to packaged-food distribution rather than open buffets like salad bars, and even swapped out buckets of coffee stirrers for individually wrapped ones.

Schools see coronavirus preparation as a good opportunity to remind students and others to maintain proper hygiene, including covering coughs with arms and not hands, staying home when sick and washing hands regularly. To get the message out, they are sending emails, issuing flashing alerts on central websites and posting signs around campus."

Second U.S. coronavirus death confirmed in Washington state

The second person in the U.S. has died due to the novel coronavirus, health officials in Washington state confirmed Sunday, as they announced new cases in the Seattle area. The news comes one day after officials in Washington state confirmed the first U.S. death. Both fatalities occurred in King County.

A Seattle-area man in his 70s who had underlying health conditions died Saturday after being hospitalized at EvergreenHealth, Seattle and King County Public Health officials said in a statement Sunday.

The man’s death was among four new confirmed cases of covid-19 in King County, bringing the local total of confirmed cases to ten. All four patients in the newest confirmed cases, including the death, were residents of Lifecare, a nursing facility in Kirkland, Wash., that is associated with two other previously confirmed cases in the area.

Kirkland, Wash., becomes epicenter of coronavirus response as cases spread

All three of the surviving patients in the newest confirmed cases range in age from their 70s to 90s, have underlying health conditions and are in critical condition, health officials said. Lifecare, the nursing facility, said it was not uncommon for residents to exhibit cold and flulike symptoms this time of year and that they may be sent to the hospital as a precaution so they can be tested for covid-19

“As precaution, all visits to the facility from families, volunteers or vendors are not allowed,” facility said in a statement Saturday.

Gov. Jay Inslee (D) declared a state of emergency Saturday as more than 231 Washington residents remain under public health supervision. The state has 13 confirmed coronavirus cases overall, with the majority in King County."

>  Part of it is due to their fan base but that’s also what drives people away because of how toxic they can be.

I personally don't see how the fanbase is more/less toxic compared to other fanbases, I just see that as an excuse to not check them out. 

Some examples of BTS fans not being toxic at all is the tons of charity events organized, after BTS canceled their recent concert in Korea, tons of fans refunded and gave money for coronavirus relief."

Obviously this is just one person's individual story, but it does add weight to the mildness of some of these cases:

'I just want to say that one my Italian friend is infected with this new coronavirus now - she lives in one of the closed towns. She got diagnosed today - she wrote me this message:  
“Actually I had no idea I was sick, I mean I had some cough and sore throat since last week but I was thinking I just have flu. Then they came to test us today to our street and they found out I have it and some of my neighbors too. They test everyone now, they tested my whole family and all neighbors. I’m at hospital intensive care and they treat us amazingly, I’m expected to be discharged by the end of the week, then I have to stay home for another week and then I’m good to go. It feels like flu, I wouldn’t recognize it if they wouldn’t test me, I would think I have some flu, they also treat it as some flu. Most of us who are here we have mild symptoms""'

In the comments below, she has since said her friend has since been discharged, due to being virus free, and that she 'she felt better than when she had flu last year'. 

Obviously there are a significant amount of cases that are more serious than this, but to me this supports the belief that there are many mild cases that simply go undetected."

""Coronavirus infections in Italy rise to 1577, while the number of victims reaches 34 and that of people cured at 83. Today there is an increase of 33 units among the healed, but also five new deaths. This is the Civil Protection report reported in the press conference by the emergency commissioner Angelo Borrelli, which also reports on the swabs for the tests carried out so far: 21,127. If you look at the data provided by the affected Regions there are 41 victims.""

I'm only explaining the discrepancy to foreign people. It's a well known fact in Italy, not a fake news. And it's also the reason you see only one official update a day, 6PM local time, in a press conference of Civil Protection.

&#x200B;

\----------   FAQ   ----------

&#x200B;

1. Why Italy used to update every few hours and now it almost stopped?

Government  kinda ordered regions not to tell about positive cases to the press,  before all samples are doublechecked by Rome labs. A Civil Protection  press conference is scheduled everyday at 6PM local time. Only Civil  Protection can give official updates.

2.  But I can see some updates on Reddit/Social networks, before 6PM, why?

Not  all regions or single hospitals are strictly respecting the order and  they're speaking to journalists about ""very suspected cases"". It means  cases who tested positive and are in queue for Rome doublechecking.  National press agency report them too.

3. Is there discrepancy from regional numbers and national numbers?

No, false positives cases are very very low. There is a delay, of course, because of doublecheck. Old samples still under testing, so numbers of cases you see it's a regional report (single + doublechecked). Death count you see is a national report (doublechecked only).

4. Is it true that italian National Healthcare Institute strongly suggested regions not to test suspected asymptomatics?

True, 3 days ago.

5. Is Italy now testing symptomatics only?

Not really. Given the number of daily tests done and the reports from  hospitals, it seems like many regions didn't strictly follow the  suggestion. Also, contacts of positives are still tracked and properly tested. Government stopped complaining with regions  about misuse of swabs. Things may change tomorrow, we will find it out  with tests reports. (Update: 2500 tests today, I'd say we're testing mostly symptomatics)

6) Do people  pay to get tested? No it's free. This doesn't mean you should go to  hospital and ask to be tested. First there is no need to be paranoid or panicking, it doesn't help. Second 10% of infections are caught there ;-)"

The woman, who is in her late 30s, is in Manhattan, according to state officials. It was not immediately clear when she returned from Iran.

Her test was confirmed Sunday in the Wadsworth Lab in Albany, N.Y. It will now be confirmed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

And think about what you'd need to take care of yourself at home for a couple of weeks if you came down with the milder form of the flu/coronavirus.

 So... What kinds of foods would you be willing to eat and able to prepare? Unless you have a ton of freezer storage, you may want to stick with items that could be tucked away into a pantry or closet. So canned soup, rice, crackers, potatoes, instant potatoes, tortillas, tuna, black or other beans, refried beans, canned vegetables, canned fruit, applesauce, jarred pasta sauce and dried pasta, broth, peanut butter, jelly/jam, cookies or chips or other snack foods, and so on. In particular, coffee or soda or tea if you have a strong beverage habit -- you don't want to be stressed about illness AND fighting caffeine withdrawal. If you have space in your freezer, things like meat, hashbrowns, frozen veggies/fruits, extra bread are all a good idea. And make sure you have seasonings and condiments, too! 

Cleaning supplies, TP, paper towels, soap, shampoo, skincare items, toothpaste, and so on should also be plentiful.

As for home healthcare, make sure you are stocked up with at least a few weeks' worth of any prescription meds you take. Then add in the things you'd need to handle being sick at home, like tissues, decongestants, aspirin or ibuprofin, cough drops, eye drops, surface disinfectants like bleach or alcohol wipes, hand sanitizer, Gatorade, ginger ale, stuff for digestive upset, and so on.

If you think you're getting the flu (fever, respiratory symptoms, etc.) you should contact your doctor or call public health to get guidance on what to do. If you're having breathing problems, get yourself into the ER as soon as possible -- but call ahead/let 911 know that you're having flu/coronavirus symptoms so they can take appropriate precautions from the first moment."

The package of measures is inspired by a principle of caution: there are fears for the stability of the health system and in particular of the intensive care wards in the North, which would be put to the test by a wide spread of the virus. This is why the closure of schools in Lombardy, Veneto and Emilia-Romagna has been confirmed until 8 March 2020. Friuli Venezia Giulia has also asked the Government and obtained the closure of regional schools and universities for another week. In Piedmont the schools reopen from Wednesday, after two days of ""sanitation"". Reopening also in Liguria, except in the province of Savona. The province of Pesaro Urbino is also included among the territories where ""the strongest measures of suspension of teaching and public entertainment activities"" are applied, for the Coronavirus emergency. The decree provides, in the regions most affected (but not in the ""red areas""), the reopening of museums and churches; the suspension of religious services for another week; in Lombardy, the stop to gyms."

Again aligns really closely to bat coronavirus to the extent that there is no doubt it arose from this virus or some common ancestor of it, but whatever happened to it since then is natural and it was quite some time ago.

It's hard to give a step by step but you can start by reading about BLAST on NCBI website. Anyone can run it through their web interface. You usually stick in one sequence, pick some algorithm and optionally change parameters, and pick a reference database. Their website is a bit of a mess though and different types of BLAST databases are scattered everywhere. It's gotten better in recent years though, a good starting point is here:

[https://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi](https://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi)

Start typing in the BLAST genomes field...I had trouble getting to the proper list of viruses because it kept putting me in some ""virioid"" database when I selected Viruses for some reason, so I had to enter HIV-1, go to the next page, and then delete HIV-1 from the organism field and database was now refseq viral genomes.

This is the reference (first) entry for the coronavirus sequence, full nucleotide sequence at the bottom, and you can view other features in software for reading Genbank files if you export this. I have software through my work, but one that you can use in a limited way for free is called Benchling, just search for it. I just use this to design stuff and view small sequence files (COVID-19 is easily viewable as it's so small).

[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/MN908947](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/MN908947)

The rest of the sequenced isolates are accessible from this portal for COVID-19:

[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genbank/sars-cov-2-seqs/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genbank/sars-cov-2-seqs/)

And you are correct, in that you can only check for deposited sequences. If it was human tampered, it would have had to be done with a huge amount of ""secret"" sequence data and I just frankly doubt anyone was smart enough for this. Murphy's law in my opinion is this looks natural."

This would suggest that the virus would have been around in Italy for longer, and if we consider the fact that there are now 1,694 patients there, of which 34 have died so far (2%), and 140 are seriously ill (8.2%), we can at least say those numbers are already lower than the Chinese equivalents, presumably due to a smaller number of undetected cases (because of the initial *relatively* thorough testing). If the virus has been in Italy since mid-January, as the Italian expert suggests in the article, then the number of infected should be very much higher now, especially since it went undetected for a long time, so there were zero precautions or containment measures.

* (Again in terms of the Princess Cuirse) the Japanese government released without a test more than 90 officials who boarded the ship during the quarantine, even though four had already tested positive — and this, according to one report, because of [concern](https://news.tbs.co.jp/newseye/tbs_newseye3911566.html) that “they won’t be able to fulfill their official duties if found positive.”"

>Now, the student health center is setting up a similar planning session.

>There have been no suspected cases of Covid-19, the illness caused by the virus, at the University of Rochester. But the school, with more than 12,000 students in western New York state, knows it might not stay that way.

>“We need to really get on top of things early,” said Dr. Ralph Manchester, vice provost and director of University Health Service, the student health center.

EAST  PROVIDENCE — The husband of an East Providence school teacher is being  tested by the Rhode Island Department of Health (RIDOH) for what would  be the state’s first documented case of the new Coronavirus Disease 2019  (COVID-19) after he took ill upon returning from a recent trip to Europe.  
  
>  
>Superintendent  Kathryn Crowley said Friday evening, Feb. 28, the man, himself in  education, chaperoned a February vacation excursion by St. Raphael  Academy students to Italy. Local authorities were still trying to  ascertain whether or not the coronavirus has cropped up in the part of  the country where the tourists visited.  
  
>  
>The RIDOH  has been closely monitoring the situation and issued a press release on  the matter Saturday afternoon, Feb. 29, following a second conference  call between state and city officials. The release follows later in this  story.  
  
>  
>The family does not live in East Providence.  The man, who has some history of respiratory illness, came home from  the trip late last week feeling under the weather. A few days later with  flu-like symptoms, he was eventually taken to Mariam Hospital where he  is undergoing tests to determine if he has COVID-19. RIDOH is overseeing  the testing and the Rhode Island Department of Education, the  superintendent said, is aware of the situation.  
  
>  
>The  man’s wife, a teacher at Silver Spring Elementary School, was back to  work Monday and Tuesday, Feb. 24 and 25, as classes started after the  mid-winter break. Following her husband’s admittance to hospital  mid-week, she and their two children voluntarily quarantined themselves  under Department of Health supervision “out an abundance of caution,”  Mrs. Crowley added. So far, no one else in the family has shown any  flu-like symptoms.  
  
>  
>The superintendent as well as  Mayor Bob DaSilva initially received an update on the situation from  RIDE officials and RIDOH director Dr. Nicole Alexander-Scott earlier  February 28. Later that day, the superintendent informed employees and  parents throughout the district along with the five members of the  School Committee about the matter.  
  
>  
>Mrs. Crowley said  Dr. Alexander-Scott emphasized there was no reason to be alarmed at  moment, but that the district and families should take proper  precautions like making sure sanitary conditions are maintained in the  home and classroom.  
  
>  
>Superintendent Crowley said  RIDOH officials set a target date to have the man’s test results back by  Sunday, March 1. Schools are scheduled to be open on Monday, March 2.  The superintendent added any proposed closure of schools in city would  have to gain approval of RIDE and likely RIDOH.  
  
>  
>The RIDOH press release on the matter issued Saturday, Feb. 29, is as follows:  
  
>  
>The  East Providence School Department is actively working with the Rhode  Island Department of Health (RIDOH) to take all necessary steps to help  prevent illness in our community. Although there have not been any cases  of COVID-19 confirmed in Rhode Island, we want to make sure that our  community is prepared.  
  
>  
>Rhode Islanders who recently  traveled to areas affected by COVID-19 have been self-quarantined, after  consultation with RIDOH staff, and are monitoring themselves for  symptoms related to the coronavirus. It is important to note that the  symptoms of COVID-19 are similar to symptoms presented by other viruses  and just because someone is ill does not necessarily mean they have  contracted COVID-19.  
  
>  
>RIDOH is currently working with  the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to test ill people  when there are cases of concern and symptoms consistent with COVID-19.  To date none of these tests have come back positive for COVID-19.  
  
>  
>Although  the level of risk for Rhode Islanders is still low and there have been  no confirmed cases in our state, everyone can contribute to our  preparedness work by taking simple, everyday steps to limit the spread  of viruses. Those steps include washing your hands regularly, covering  coughs and sneezes, and staying home when you are sick.  
  
>  
>At  this time, the CDC does not recommend use of facemasks among the  general public. The CDC’s position is that if you are not sick, you  should not wear a facemask. The masks should be reserved for those who  are sick, so they can prevent further spread of the virus.  
  
>  
>Because  human coronaviruses are most commonly spread through respiratory  droplets, RIDOH recommends the same measures that prevent the spread of  flu and other similar viruses.  
  
>  
>Wash your hands often  with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. Use an alcohol-based hand  sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol if soap and water are not  available.  
Avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth with unwashed hands.  
Avoid close contact with people who are sick.  
Stay home when you are sick.  
Cover your cough or sneeze with a tissue, then throw the tissue in the trash.  
Explore, understand, and update policies and resources for sick-leave and telework.  
Clean and disinfect frequently touched objects and surfaces (desks, tables, countertops, door handles, railings, etc.).  
Clean the surface first to remove all organic matter. Thorough cleaning with soap and water will remove most microorganisms.  
Use “EPA-approved” cleaners to clean high-touch surfaces and patient care areas.  
We  can all work collaboratively to share accurate information and to  reject potentially harmful myths. Remember that people who returned more  than 14 days ago from areas where COVID-19 is active and do not have  symptoms of COVID-19 do not put others at risk."
2020-03-01,haarr1,wallstreetbets,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fbzzu9/no_more_uni/fj7oojj/,">The American College Health Association, an organization of campus health programs at more than 1,100 institutions, created a task force on the virus 10 days ago. “And it is as if we have been shot out of a cannon since then,” said Dr. Jean Chin, an associate clinical professor of medicine at the University of Georgia who is chairing the new group.

>The team is reviewing guidelines from the CDC, World Health Organization, the U.S. State Department and other authorities, distilling medical literature into digestible advisories for campus communities and establishing guidelines to help members prepare for the disease.

>The University of Rochester established a Coronavirus University Response Team in February, looking at everything from emergency response and public health to addressing possible xenophobia, monitoring international travel and planning for the potential impact on applications and enrollment.

>The University of Colorado Boulder created a pandemic section for its emergency operations plan in 2015, and one for infectious disease a year later. The guidelines lay out things like how to coordinate with local health officials and various containment measures once a threat has been identified. The campus has roughly 35,500 students.

>Decisions such as halting campus operations would depend on how many cases were confirmed and where the affected people live, said Dan Jones, Boulder’s associate vice chancellor for integrity, safety and compliance.

>Some schools don’t have to dust off their doomsday guides because they have recently battled contagious diseases. Syracuse University had dozens of confirmed cases of mumps in late 2017 and had to coordinate closely with the CDC and county and state health departments.

>A few years ago, Rochester had roughly 200 reported cases of norovirus, whose symptoms include vomiting and diarrhea. Dr. Manchester said there were likely closer to 1,000 people affected.

>The last six weeks of spring semester that year, the university was in “all-out ‘control-this-outbreak’ mode,” Dr. Manchester said. The school stepped up regular cleaning services, switched to packaged-food distribution rather than open buffets like salad bars, and even swapped out buckets of coffee stirrers for individually wrapped ones.

>Schools see coronavirus preparation as a good opportunity to remind students and others to maintain proper hygiene, including covering coughs with arms and not hands, staying home when sick and washing hands regularly. To get the message out, they are sending emails, issuing flashing alerts on central websites and posting signs around campus."

And then, this could continue on as a seasonal coronavirus flu, for at least a year until a vaccine is found and manufacturing spun up.

And then, the vaccine will have only 6 to 9 months effectiveness as the genetic drift in the nCov coronavirus will require new vaccine formulations, similar to the seasonal flu vaccines.

They postulate that the virus has been floating around Washington state area for that long.   The newest case got it in the community

This is a fact due to the genome being identical and it means something very significant.

Based on the time involved, there is over 100 cases in Washington already and more.   People are having only mild symptoms and not seeking treatment OR they think it is just seasonal flu.

Why is this significant?   It points to the fact that what was speculated about China’s numbers were likely correct all along.  That is to say, there was way more cases of this virus then what has been reported and it could be due to a myriad of factors not the least of which is an over-whelmed health system and people just not going to the hospital with mild sympoms riding it out at home.

So, what does this mean?  It means that, if you use the Washington situation, for example, all of those cases are mild.  If you look at China you realize you cannot rely on their numbers because, to accurately assess percentages of mild/moderate, serious, critical and death rate you have to actually know the real numbers.  Those figures were based on the reported numbers and, ifyou add ALOT more cases that were not reported, you get a much lower mortality/critical case percentage. (assuming deaths were accurately reported though which is also an unknown)

The only thing is that Iran is not following that at the moment but some say itis mirroring Wuhan in the early stages in that there was no mitigation happening as it was an unknown and it took awhile to get the situation under control which lead to people staying at home, which skewed the numbers.

So, as for any of these numbers, nothing can be said, definitively until ALL figures are accurate. If there is a silent and mild to moderate virus that is very contagious floating around communities it would take awhile before you knew it because someof the timelines for this virus are long when coupled with incubation periods.

So, don’t run for the hills yet.  We are onlhy seeing the worst cases right now because they are those that are needing care so it might seem worse than what it will, ultimately, turn out to be.

That said, it won’t be a picnic and people will die and you might get sick, but the world won’t end."

I will keep commenting this on every post i see that downplays the coronavirus

“Its not always about mortality rate, its also about the how sick people can get. The disease is highly infectious and the incubation period is absolutely brutal, about 2-3 weeks of going through the illness which is 2-3 times longer than the average incubation period of the flu. In 3rd world countries, that could mean loss of job, home, food for family, etc. I don’t mean to be political, but living in a first world country, you don’t realize how devastating an illness can be to family living in poverty.

Its mortality rate is also 30x higher than the flu

Even if it becomes an epidemic in the Chinese, indian, Korean, filipino region of Asia, thats about 1.2B x .03 = 3.6M”"

At minimum( the spread rate of the seasonal flu. The mortality rate is below 3%. I'm not sure what you're talking about in terms of hospitalization rate.

These numbers are over inflated because a lot of people just have a cough or maybe a fever or something, so they don't go to the hospital and don't get diagnosed.

The only thing worrying about the coronavirus is that we haven't developed a vaccine for it yet, even then, some vaccines are in early trials."

Added to the other 15% that needs oxygen etc, it’s 20% that per WHO are in the hospital for WEEKS. Once there are too many cases for hospitals to handle, the fatality rate can begin to be most of the 20% that are serious/critical cases. With that kind of death, plus all the sick folks, infrastructure can break down... deliveries of food and things like supplies to water companies for cleaning public water can stop causing food and water shortages... Garbage piling up...if power lines go down and nobody fixes them, cooking and basic living can be difficult. Heat. Nebulizers and cpap machines.  Lots of things electricity does for us. People might die of unrelated things like appendicitis because surgery isn’t available due to hospitals being overrun. 

I’m not a doctor or researcher. I’m am English Lit major with an MAT in education. I taught preschool age for years. If i can understand how bad this can get... if I can read the medical studies coming out (including not peer reviewed)... if I can watch videos in mandarin (translations help but many times what I see speaks for itself) to see how things really are in Wuhan... if I could say on January 21st that this could be catastrophic... WTF is wrong with the CDC here in the states?

Only a blithering idiot would only allow testing for people who came from China or had direct  contact with a confirmed case. With all the flights coming in from China before the travel ban, what idiot thought. NOT ONE PERSON would come into the country infected? What idiot said, HEY LET’S CHECK FOR FEVER AS THE INDICATOR EVEN THOUGH WE KNOW PEOPLE ARE ASYMPTOMATIC AND CONTAGIOUS DURING THE INCUBATION PHASE?  What idiot thought we were miraculously going to avoid geting slammed by a coronavirus that we didn’t even really try to contain? 

Most of my family STILL thinks this is nothing to worry about. Why? Because the CDC is not telling people how serious this is. They stood right next to Trump and did not correct the lies he told. Our cases are decreasing. It’s like the regular flu. This should be over in April. 

Why in the world would an organization that is supposed to exist to safeguard human life, sit around twiddling their thumbs while the proverbial Rome (us in this case) burns? If people understood this was serious, they could start social distancing, etc now to help slow or precent spread. They don’t want to start a panic?? Because the dead bodies piling up won’t start a panic?? Because letting this coronavirus spread is the better choice? Do they realize that dead people don’t work or spend money?"

Reading through some very informative posts and was thinking finally there is an aggregated source of reliable information.   However, like some, I’m in the casual observer category but want to educate myself as quickly as possible.  Please forgive me in advance if any of the following is way too broad for a single post or if my questions come across as basic or even dumb.  

Main Question:  What are the mechanics of the process for identifying people who may be infected and require testing?  

Here’s what I’ve gathered to date re the general ‘workflow’.  As I walk through and try to dissect this this, I’ll include relevant links / questions.  

- A person is symptomatic OR is asymptotic but has been in contact with someone who has tested positive for COVID-19 OR has travelled to China (Wuhan).  

- Person makes appointment with local health care provider for a COVID-19 screening. 

Q: Does it make sense for a person who meets the criteria of the first bullet to physically present to a provider and risk spreading infection?  
Q: If it does make sense to be physically present, where does one go (Urgent Care, Family Practice clinic, Hospital ER, all of the above)? 
Q: Can this initial screening be done via AI on a telemedicine app (Teladoc, Babylon, etc.) with a follow on appointment with telemedicine provider?  
Q: Should the person requiring screening be segregated from the rest of the patients in the waiting room, be made to wear mask, etc.?   
Q: Are there unique COVID-19 screening centers / locations?  And if so, are these locations posted on the web?   
Q:  I’m sure this is policy dependent but is any of this covered by insurance (hate to say it but is there an ICD-10 code on COVID-19) or will the patient have to pay out of pocket?  This is important just to get in the door (typically). 

- The provider screens patient for COVID-19 to determine whether patient is at risk and meets CDC criterion for diagnostic testing. 

https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/clinical-criteria

Q: Can any medical provider conduct this screening? 
Q: Does a provider need to be specifically trained to provide this screening?  

- If the provider determines the patient meets the criterion, the provider will contact/coordinate with their respective local or state health authorities.  See CDC link. 

- The local / state health authorities will ultimately decide if the patient qualifies for testing.   (I don’t have a link for this particular step as it seems to be state driven.  Request any clarification you may have. 

- If the local / state health authorities deem the patient meets CDC criterion and qualifies for testing, the patient will then either a) have specimen collected there and then. b) referred to a local provider for specimen collection (under a telemedicine scenario).  See cdc link above regarding specimen collection. 

Q: What happens when a patient does not meet testing criterion but may need to be monitored? Q: Are there separate criterion for this sub group? 

- A local prover will collect specimens and send to local or state health lab for diagnostic testing. See CDC link above. 

- Results sent to cdc, state/local authorities as well as patient and provider.  Positive results posted publicly scrubbed for PII.  This site is the best I’ve found regarding location but only includes confirmed cases.  
https://www.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html#/bda7594740fd40299423467b48e9ecf6

Q: Why is there only publicly available location  data on ‘confirmed cases’ but not on persons who may be in the testing process / under surveillance?   Am I wrong?  

- If the patient tests positive, he or she is referred to be admitted at a local hospital.   

I know this is a high level summary, but is this more or less accurate? 

Finally, I understand the criterion for testing was significantly broadened late last week enabling many more people to qualify.  That’s a very good thing.    I also understand CDC changed the testing protocols, including updated test kits.  This change has now allowed thousands of state and local labs to perform these tests - no longer required to send to cdc for testing. Updated kits being sent out to state and local health labs now. https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.nbcnews.com/news/amp/ncna1145206]

Take the above as my best layperson attempt to gather information.  If this is too much subject matter for a single post, I sincerely apologize.  But in my career I’ve learned the devil is always in the details.   

Thanks for reading."

As of March 1, 2020, there were 71 confirmed and presumptive cases of coronavirus in the United States, including one death. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) publishes official numbers every Monday, Wednesday and Friday.U.S. health authorities, including the CDC, are urging local governments, businesses, and schools to develop plans like cancelling mass gatherings or switching to teleworking so as to be ready when the need arises. To prevent the spread of coronavirus, the CDC recommends washing hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds (or using an alcohol-based hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol if soap and water are not available), avoiding touching one's eyes, nose, and mouth, covering coughs and sneezes, staying home when one is sick, avoiding close contact with people who are sick, and cleaning and disinfecting ""frequently touched objects and surfaces using a regular household cleaning spray or wipe.""As of January 31, 2020, the U.S. government requires Americans returning home after travelling in China's Hubei Province to submit to a 14-day quarantine.

This is a tremendous logistical problem (let alone a clinical one) which involves not just your specific site but also EMS, local law enforcement, and all surrounding regional hospitals/urgent care centers. It's alarming that your hospital is not already taking the appropriate steps. Nevertheless, it's great that you're taking charge. I would start reading over all resources you can find [here](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/infection-control/control-recommendations.html) and [here](http://www.centerforhealthsecurity.org/cbn/2020/cbnreport-02272020.html). I think you're off to a great start with the focus on PPE. A good, relatively straightforward, first step could be to hold quick re-freshers for all staff on PPE.

edit: Thinking more about my experiences... something that probably is not outlined in formal protocols: Try and have a non-clinical resource (like unit secretary) from each nursing station within the ED, perform regular cleaning of all work stations within their unit. I know house staff will perform cleaning, but it wouldn't hurt to have more regularl cleanings of keyboards, counters, etc. of where the providers work. Providers usually do this themselves when they first come in for a shift. But it might help to have someone else be in charge of doing this frequently (if there's enough wipes that is)."

Hi,
Further to my previous email below, The W.H.O Director Tedros Adhanom has recommended this afternoon that ""If you are 60+, or have an underlying condition like cardiovascular disease, a respiratory condition or diabetes, you have a higher risk of developing severe COVID19. Try to avoid crowded areas, (such as public transport) or places where you might interact with people who are sick."" The UK Government have confirmed they 'will be following all W.H.O advice to stop the spread of the virus and to protect vulnerable people in at risk groups', I suspect the general public will receive more information after their Cobra meeting tomorrow. I've attached details in the link below:

https://www.google.com/amp/s/news.sky.com/story/amp/coronavirus-who-warns-elderly-and-sick-to-avoid-crowds-as-louvre-shuts-doors-11947053

I have informed my manager of the updated situation this evening and already have full laptop access to work from home.

I rely on 2 busy trains into London and back which is very high risk in our current situation. I am also a severe asthmatic and rely on steroid inhalers to control my condition. On top of this I also had two recent operations in November, and am currently undergoing investigations for cardiomyopathy.

In light of recent UK community transmissions and in line with today's updated Government and W.H.O advice, I feel that it would be a good idea for the safety of 'all staff over 60, and those with underlying conditions like cardiovascular disease, a respiratory condition or diabetes' (especially those in this category that are solely reliant on public transport networks) to be able to work from home until there are further updates.""

https://joop.bnnvara.nl/nieuws/coronapatient-verbleef-weeklang-onbeschermd-in-ziekenhuis-gorinchem

Partial translation:

A patient who later tested positive for the coronavirus in the Erasmus Medical Centre (a second test has yet to confirm the result) spent a week unprotected in the intensive care unit of the Beatrix Hospital in Gorinchem. NU.nl reveals this on the basis of an internal message from the Beatrix Hospital.
The patient in question stayed at the intensive care unit of the hospital in Gorinchem between February 21st and February 28th, according to the announcement. In that period there was no reason under the RIVM protocol to test the patient for the coronavirus, the statement states. The hospital writes that employees who have been in the department in question while the patient was there, and who show symptoms of illness, must isolate themselves and inform their manager in order to be tested for the coronavirus.

Translated with www.DeepL.com/Translator (free version)

It's sickening.

I hope you can confince them to have it tested, **maybe you can show them the atricle on the situation in the Netherlands. **

The results are still unknown as it happened today. The hospital is shut off from visitors and new patients.

Dick2015 1 March 2020 at 18:53
Heard from reasonably reliable sources that apparently 3 doctors are infected in Gorinchem, get the idea that the protocol of the RIVM is somewhat lacking in this.
First with the nitrogen hassle and now with the Covid-19 they don't really build up a good reputation when it comes to trust.

A Chinese man has been sentenced to death for killing 2 health officers at a coronavirus traffic check purpose in Yunnan province, in step with an announcement by the Yunnan province provincial government.

The man drove atiny low van to the stop and refused to follow directions by the employees. Another traveller within the van got off and tried to get rid of a road block, despite warnings from employees members at the check purpose.

When one amongst the staffers started recording the incident as “evidence,” the driving force of the van “felt dissatisfied” with the recording and began stabbing the employee with a pocket knife within the chest and abdomen, in step with the statement.

The man then enraptured on to stab the abdomen of another employee at the stop United Nations agency came up to intervene. each employees members died.

Among the many outlandish statements President Trump has made since taking office, one in particular stands out for me.
Speaking in Kansas City, Mo., in the summer of 2018, he urged the attendees of the VFW annual convention to ignore the journalism of the mainstream media.
“Just stick with us, don’t believe the crap you see from these people, the fake news,” he said. “What you’re seeing and what you’re reading is not what’s happening.”
In other words, if you didn’t hear from me or my minions, it isn’t true.
Chico Marx memorably expressed a similar idea in the 1933 comedy “Duck Soup”: “Who ya gonna believe — me or your own eyes?”
It’s a dumbfounding notion, especially given Trump’s proven propensity for lies and falsehoods. But now as a deadly disease, the coronavirus, threatens to turn into a full-blown pandemic, it’s not simply bizarre in a way that can be easily shrugged off. It’s not just Trump being Trump.
AD
Keep Reading

And it’s definitely not funny. It’s dangerous.
Coronavirus: live updates, latest news

Trump and his chosen spokespeople are attempting to dramatically play down the seriousness of the coronavirus and to blame the legitimate news media for doing their jobs of informing the public.
As Democrats slam Trump over coronavirus, Pence and Azar go on the defense

Vice President Pence and the HHS secretary panned criticism of the Trump administration's actions on the coronavirus March 1, but warned it will keep spreading. (Sarah Parnass/The Washington Post)
In reporting what Trump has to say, the news media has a huge responsibility not to repeat and amplify his misleading spin — a spin that may serve his political interests but is not in the public interest.
It’s not always easy, though, for mainstream journalists to put his claims in the proper context.
After all, it had always been normal to let a president have his say — to let his statements top the news while letting the fact checks follow.
AD

That has changed somewhat during the lie-ridden Trump administration, but not nearly enough. The reflexive media urge, deep in our DNA, is still to quote the president without offering an immediate challenge.
That’s why we continue to see headlines and chyrons that parrot his words directly, no matter how misleading: That the virus will disappear, that it’s not inevitable that the disease will spread, that a vaccine is coming along “rapidly,” that the United States is “very, very ready” to deal with whatever happens.
How chyrons took on a life of their own in the Trump era

When journalists do push back with fact checks or with dissenting sources from the worlds of science and medicine, Trump and the administration attack the messengers. Sometimes that takes the form of disparaging tweets such as one from Wednesday in which he charged cable networks MSNBC and CNN of “panicking markets” and in which he bragged “USA in great shape!”

His most dependable allies are right there with him — accusing the mainstream news media of using virus coverage to try to take down the president.
AD

Their logic seems to be that the drastic stock market declines in recent days are the result of media overkill, not legitimate business concerns. “What I might do to calm the markets is turn the television off for 24 hours,” was acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney’s advice Friday to the audience at the Conservative Political Action Conference.
Conservative pundits blame a grab bag of supposed villains amid the coronavirus outbreak

Some months ago, I wrote about the linguist George Lakoff’s prescription for handling the president’s false statements and lies, an approach that’s become known as the “truth sandwich.”
Rather than lead with the falsehood and then try to debunk it, Lakoff — an expert on how propaganda works — suggested flipping that formula: Lead with the truth, air the falsehood, and then follow with the fact check.
AD

Avoid giving prominence to lies, he advises. Don’t put them in headlines, leads or tweets. It is that very amplification that gives them power, even if they are proclaimed false in the next beat.
Of course, that recommendation runs in direct opposition to how news usually works. Traditionally, we have emphasized the words of top officials, and only then tempered them with fact checks.
What you need to know about coronavirus: Symptoms, risks, how to prepare

Too often, Lakoff told me, the media “has become complicit with Trump by allowing itself to be used as an amplifier for his falsehoods and frames.” And that’s true even when journalists make lists of lies. It’s the repetition and the prominence that does the harm.
AD

Trump’s tendency to spin out assertions untethered from reality becomes a recipe for disaster when combined with his disdain for scientists, medical experts, intelligence officials, journalists and others who deal in fact-based reality.
Add in the dangers of a disease rapidly approaching pandemic proportions, and it becomes more important than ever to emphasize truthful information over false spin.
I’m convinced that we in the media, with all our obvious faults, have learned some things about covering Trump over the past four years. Now would be an excellent time to put it into practice.

Trying some BLAST alignments on it but need to figure out how to pull up right databases since I usually do this with microbes, but putting in S protein gene against other coronaviruses, it's *totally* scrambled vs bat. It is not artificially derived from the bat one, can tell you that. It's also already mutating a bit, shows how fast that can happen considering it's got to be only dozens of viral generations. Also just BLASTed the longest ORF which is nearly half the virus and again, totally scrambled vs bat. 

Ok now just aligned the whole thing and there is not a single region that is not scrambled vs bat coronavirus (which is universally the closest betacoronavirus alignment, if there was a piece taken from another one, it'd be at top of alignment list). This is not artificially made from parts of literally any other coronavirus. Next I will try to align against all viral genomes if I can figure out how."

The only benefit I see in isolation is when you already have the coronavirus and want to stop the spread while you recover. Other than that there is no benefit to isolation because you will get the virus eventually anyway. So all the people asking when is the right time to isolate there is your answer. Thoughts?"

It is even harder when there are things we don't know- and scientists are trained that we do not know things until we 1000% know them. The fact that articles get written by journalists and published by outlets who rely on clicks doesn't help either. I don't know what articles you're looking at specifically so I can't comment about particulars, but, it is a never ending issue for us. It's just an imperfect system.

So, some points:

* Read the CDC and WHO pages, not just news outlets. And read with an open mind. We are all susceptible to confirmation bias, and reading critically is helpful. 
* As the articles you've been reading should be noting, it is very possible that the fatality rate is much lower because we are missing mild cases that aren't getting tested. 
* People also write things to write things even when there's nothing new to report. They're worried too, and again, they want clicks. I'm not bashing them- I get it. But that means we as a consuming public need to factor that in as we balance a complex series of factors. Think of how much news coverage ebola got, and how affected you were by that. 
* You have experienced a pandemic in your lifetime: H1N1, aka swine flu. COVID19 is *not* a pandemic. But if it became one: think back to 2009, think about any effects it had on you, anyone you know affected by it. That's not a promise this will be the same (as a scientist, I have to say that). But it is perspective to include in your balance of thoughts. 
* There are only 73 cases in the entire US. 
* Scientists know so much more than we did a month ago. A month from now will know more. You do have time. You can wait and see what happens. The US being so isolated geographically (in comparison to European countries, for example) certainly helps, too. 
* These articles and sources aren't just written for you, a receptive reader, but everyone. The flu kills hundreds of thousands of people worldwide *a year*- including at least 10,000 in the US compared to the single coronavirus death here- and yet we still can't get people to get their flu shot. 

It is always scary to grapple with the unknown. What you're feeling is so real. And it is hard to sit there doing nothing when you worry you should be doing something. The bottom line is though that we are many, many steps away from the hypotheticals you are dwelling on here. There's a reason the WHO has a section on dealing with stress about this- because it's an uncertain situation that could be nothing, could be something, and that eats at us. The best thing you can do for yourself is address your stress over uncertainty however works best for you and take care of yourself. If there is some preparation you can do that is healthy and useful, do it. If not, give yourself permission to wait and see. That is all any of us can do. As a scientist (also in NYC!), that's what I'll be doing- doing the standard flu season thing, no face mask, monitoring the situation and otherwise living my life. That's all any of us can do."

As seemingly bad news trickled out over the weekend -- more cases, more deaths, more dramatic preventive measures -- there was one piece of news that began to put the virus into context: coronavirus had likely been in Washington (and everywhere else) for weeks.

Unfortunately, the easiest and most visible thing for the media to cover has been the deaths. That leads to awareness of the worst possible outcome with a giant unknown (fear) of everything else.

Now, as the media works backwards, we're likely going to get a much more proper sense of the true scale of the danger, and the likely recommended response is going to be to take the same precautions you would during flu season.

Now, I still acknowledge that the situation is serious. It's serious because we're talking about stocks, and stocks are all about confidence, and confidence is on the brink of being shattered. But as China comes back online, if the US and EU commit to a more measured response, the worst may be just about here."
