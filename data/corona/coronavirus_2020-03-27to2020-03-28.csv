>But when both were tested a second time for the coronavirus on Sunday, March 22, as a precondition for seeking medical care for unrelated health issues, **they tested positive for the coronavirus even though they exhibited none of the typical symptoms, such as a fever or dry cough**. The time from their recovery and release to the retest ranged from a few days to a few weeks.

>It is possible they were first given a false negative test result, which can happen if the swab used to collect samples of the virus misses bits of the virus. **Dr. Li Wenliang, a whistleblowing doctor who later died of the virus himself in February, tested negative for the coronavirus several times before being accurately diagnosed.**

>In February, Wang Chen, a director at the state-run Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, estimated that **the nucleic acid tests used in China were accurate at identifying positive cases of the coronavirus only 30%-50% of the time.**

>Another theory is that, because the test amplifies tiny bits of DNA, **residual virus from the initial infection could have falsely resulted in that second positive reading**.

TLDR, they show traces of the virus but do not get sick again. They are being tested to make sure they're not contagious (they shouldn't be), and the primary culprit is probably just junk tests with ridiculous error rates."

2020-03-27,Viewfromthe31stfloor,Coronavirus,44,https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/fq7iao/i_am_hospitalized_with_the_coronavirus/flozzo1/,"“On March 12 I got a fever that didn’t go away.

It hovered around 101 or 102 degrees for the next week, accompanied by severe fatigue and body aches. My office was already working remotely, so I powered through and kept at it, with lots of breaks and naps. I saw a doctor via video who said it was probably the flu — possibly the coronavirus, he added, but tests were unavailable and the prescription, rest and fluids, would be the same regardless.

I naturally worried about the coronavirus, but I didn’t have respiratory symptoms. I’m also a 45-year-old, generally healthy nonsmoker (I quit years ago) with none of the high-risk conditions listed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. I didn’t seem like a probable Covid-19 candidate.

Then, about a week in, I began to cough. Taking deep breaths felt as if fire were shooting through my lungs. My primary care doctor, with whom I also consulted via video, thought it was pneumonia and prescribed a course of antibiotics. New York State set up a coronavirus testing site an hour from my home. When I called for an appointment, I waited on hold for 80 minutes, after which someone took my information and said someone else would call me back. No one did.

Eight days after the fever first manifested, I could barely move. My wife took me to an urgent care clinic, where I received a chest X-ray and confirmation that I had pneumonia. They swabbed me for the coronavirus but their lab was overwhelmed, and they didn’t know when they would receive any results. I’ve still not heard from them.
I returned home in terrible shape, chest burning and wracked with chills, unable to do anything other than shudder under a blanket. My primary doctor urged my wife to take me to the E.R., which she did. There, they gave me a coronavirus test and another chest X-ray, but blood tests suggested that my oxygen and white blood cell levels were decent. They sent me home but insisted that should I feel worse, I should call them back immediately.

The next day, my temperature spiked to 103.5 degrees. We called the E.R., and they told us to come back. That night I was admitted to Northern Dutchess Hospital in Rhinebeck, N.Y.

The first night and day were a literal fever-dream of pricks, prods, scans and sweat. I floated in and out of consciousness and hallucinations as nurses drew blood from all over and gave me shots of blood thinner in my stomach, which became a daily routine. Someone took another chest X-ray.

On the second day I was more lucid but still felt horrendous, and a friendly doctor came in with two bits of news: The coronavirus test I took in the E.R. had come back positive and the latest X-ray wasn’t good. He showed me the earlier X-ray from the E.R.: Each lung had a cloudy patch near the bottom but was otherwise clear. Then he showed me the new X-ray. It looked liked some demented handyman had sprayed my lungs with insulation.

It was one of bleakest moments of the ordeal, surpassed only by the moment when I wondered, as I hugged my 9-year-old daughter goodbye on the way to the hospital, if I would ever hug her again.
My doctor said we’d stay the course and perhaps add another antibiotic to the mix. But if things didn’t start to turn around soon, he added, I would need to move into the intensive care unit. I lay back, utterly dispirited, and turned on the TV. It was on CNN. President Trump was telling someone he wanted to reopen the country by Easter.

A few weeks ago I would have rolled my eyes and made a joke about how he should socially distance himself on some Mar-a-Lago golf course. Just go away and let the adults figure things out.

But my experience has made this pandemic much less abstract, and left me in no mood for jokes. I’m writing this from my hospital bed in Rhinebeck, on Day 14 of my Covid-pneumonia saga.

It has been miserable in general, with spikes of both awful physical pain and real terror, given the uncertainties that still surround the disease and its outcomes. I think of my wife and daughter every minute.

But I also feel humbled and awed by the care I’ve received from nurses, doctors, technicians, cleaning and food staff members, all of them strangers who risk getting this disease every time they come in to help me, which they do over and over, day after day, with good cheer and expertise. It is heroic and moving.

Every time the president minimizes this crisis, he is making these people’s lives more difficult. When he makes the pandemic seem less serious than it is, he gives those inclined to disregard it license to do so.

The virus doesn’t care about political talking points. Fewer precautions taken across the country will result in more patients. Which means that the people now helping me, and the thousands like them all over the nation, will soon have more patients than they can handle. These people — who are leaving their own families behind every day to help other people’s mothers, fathers, children and grandparents — will be asked to do even more.
For me, things did start to turn around as the drugs did their work. My fever broke a day ago and my most recent chest X-ray shows signs of improvement. I am feeling better. I feel confident that I will hug my wife and daughter again, even though plenty of quarantining will remain for each of us — their health has been fine, thankfully — after I am discharged. I know how fortunate I am, thanks to the support of my family, friends and employer — and most crucially, having health insurance. I also know the country has only begun to contend with this crisis.

I’m also lucky to have had such excellent caretakers, who help me sit up and eat and bathe and rest and heal, all the while telling me how much they are praying for me. We cannot do enough for these people, who are selflessly performing the world’s most important work. They are saving our lives. They have saved mine.

As this crisis intensifies, we must think about how to make their lives easier, whether through direct bonus payments, student loan and debt forgiveness, free groceries, free child care or all of the above (or something else entirely). We must mobilize American industry to expand our medical infrastructure. People are conducting sewing drives to make masks for health care workers. That’s sweet and noble, but why aren’t companies like Proctor & Gamble churning them out by the millions? I saw a TV ad that said Ford will work with lessees affected by the coronavirus. Great. Now why don’t you get going on a few hundred thousand ventilators?

And of course, we must expand testing as rapidly as possible.

This is a national health emergency, and we must treat it with the seriousness it deserves. We must listen to the health professionals. And we must do everything we can to help them save us.

And I want to make two points to you. I want to make two promises. This is a different beast that we are dealing with. This is an invisible beast, this is an insidious beast. This is not going to be a short deployment. This is not going to be that you go out there for a few days we work hard and go home. This is going to be weeks and weeks and weeks. This is going to be a long day and it’s going to be a hard day and it’s going to be a ugly day and it’s going to be a sad day. 

This is a rescue mission that you’re are on. The mission is to save lives, that’s what you are doing, the rescue mission is to save lives and as hard as we work we are not going be able to save everyone. and what’s even more cruel is this enemy doesn’t attack the strongest of us, it attacks the weakest of us. It attacks our most vulnerable, which makes it even worse in many ways, because these are the people that every instinct tells us we’re suppose to protect. These are our parents and our grandparents, these are our aunts our uncles, these are our relatives who is sick, and every instinct says protect them, help them, because they need us, and those are the exact people that this enemy attacks.  

Every time I’ve called out the national guard, I’ve said the same thing to you, I promise you I will not ask you to do anything that I will not do myself and I’ll never ask you to do go anywhere that I won’t go myself. And the same is true here. We are going to do this and we are going to do this together. 

My 2nd point is:

You are living a moment in history. This is going to be one of those moments they are going to write about and they are going to talk about for generations. This is a moment that is going to change this nation. This is a moment that forges character, forges people, changes people, make them stronger, make them weaker, but this is a moment that will change character.  

And ten years from now, you will be talking about today to your children or your grandchildren and you will shed a tear, because you will remember the lives lost and you’ll remember the faces, and you’ll remember the names, and you’ll remember how hard we worked and that we still lost loved ones, and you’ll shed a tear and you should, because it will be sad, but you will also be proud, you will be proud because of what you did. You’ll be proud that you showed up. You showed up. When other people played it safe, you had the courage to show up and you had the skill and the professionalism to make a difference and save lives. That’s what you will have done. And at the end of the day nobody can ask anything more from you, that is your duty, to do what you can when you can, and you will have shown skill and courage and talent, you’ll be there with your mind and you’ll be there with your heart, and you’ll serve with honor, and that will give you pride and you should be proud. I know I am proud of you. Every time the National Guard has been called out, they have made every New Yorker proud, and I’m proud to be with you yet again. And I’m proud to fight this fight with you. I bring you thanks from all New Yorkers who are just so appreciative of the sacrifice that you are making, the skill that you are bringing, the talent that you are bringing and you give many New Yorkers confidence. So I say my friends, that we go out there today and we kick Coronavirus ass. That’s what I say. And we’re going to save lives and New York is going to thank you. God Bless each and every one of you."

Second, only a small fraction of prisoners are being considered for home confinement - older convicts, who are at high risk of serious effects and low risk of reoffense. If it were some constitutional mandate, then all prisoners would be released. 

Third, the prisoners being considered *aren't* sick. Certainly there's no constitutional requirement that prisons are able to provide hypothetical future care or you go home.

Deaths will necessarily trail the increase in new cases, and the promising news has been that new cases and the percentage of positive tests have been decreasing slightly the last couple days after flattening for the previous 5-6 days.  

Specifically, there were 5959 new positive tests out of a little over 33000 new tests, which is an 18% positive rate and in line with the last two days (18% & 16%), after being in the mid-20s for the previous 5-6 days.  

Also, 33k tests is significantly more than they ran during the 5-6 day period (which was itself far above what they'd run previously).

The only thing that has changed is the education that will get you to your goals. Your college will not determine what you end up doing. You are still the same brilliant, amazing, kind person. The only difference between now and before is a VERY small part of the path you take to achieve your goals.

February 25: “CDC and my Administration are doing a GREAT job of handling Coronavirus.”

March 4: “If we have thousands or hundreds of thousands of people that get better just by, you know, sitting around and even going to work — some of them go to work, but they get better.”

&#x200B;

March 5: “I NEVER said people that are feeling sick should go to work.”

&#x200B;

March 5: “The United States… has, as of now, only 129 cases… and 11 deaths. We are working very hard to keep these numbers as low as possible!”

&#x200B;

March 6: “I think we’re doing a really good job in this country at keeping it down… a tremendous job at keeping it down.”

March 6: “Anybody right now, and yesterday, anybody that needs a test gets a test. They’re there. And the tests are beautiful…. the tests are all perfect like the letter was perfect. The transcription was perfect. Right? This was not as perfect as that but pretty good.”

&#x200B;

March 6: “I like this stuff. I really get it. People are surprised that I understand it… Every one of these doctors said, ‘How do you know so much about this?’ Maybe I have a natural ability. Maybe I should have done that instead of running for president.”

March 6: “I don't need to have the numbers double because of one ship that wasn't our fault.”

&#x200B;

March 8: “We have a perfectly coordinated and fine tuned plan at the White House for our attack on CoronaVirus.”

&#x200B;

March 9: “This blindsided the world.”

&#x200B;

Edit: March 9: ""The Fake News Media and their partner, the Democrat Party, is doing everything within its semi-considerable power (it used to be greater!) to inflame the CoronaVirus situation, far beyond what the facts would warrant.”

&#x200B;

March 10: ""It will go away. Just stay calm. It will go away.""

March 13: National Emergency Declaration

&#x200B;

March 13: “I don't take responsibility at all”

&#x200B;

March 15: ""TODAY IS A NATIONAL DAY OF PRAYER. GOD BLESS EVERYONE!""

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

March 22: “It is absolutely critical that Americans continue to follow the federal government’s guidelines. So important about social distancing, non-essential travel, and hand-washing.”

&#x200B;

March 23: Democratic concerns have focused on a $500 billion funding program Republicans want to create for loans and loan guarantees, with some Democrats calling it a “slush fund” that lacks any oversight because the Treasury Department would have broad discretion over who receives the money. Asked about this Monday evening, Trump responded, “I’ll be the oversight.” The vote Monday was 49 to 46, well short of the 60-vote threshold needed to advance the legislation for a final debate.

&#x200B;

March 24: “THE CURE CANNOT BE WORSE (by far) THAN THE PROBLEM!”

&#x200B;

But sure.

Also, pretty sure Obama would have canceled an order for ventilators just so he could haggle a bit on the price as well. Your president is a fucking moron, and it's showing.

A 56-year-old Chinese man caught the coronavirus 'within 15 seconds' of standing next to an infected woman at a market and talking to each other. Local officials revealed neither patient wore a face mask to protect themselves.

In Singapore, forty-one health-care workers in the course of four days were exposed to a critically ill pneumonia patient who was diagnosed with covid-19 later. These were high-risk exposures, including exposures during intubation and hands-on intensive care. Eighty-five per cent of the workers used only surgical masks. Yet, owing to proper hand hygiene, none of them became infected.

[http://www.donga.com/en/article/all/20200229/1992687/1/First-case-of-COVID-19-transmission-inside-an-elevator](http://www.donga.com/en/article/all/20200229/1992687/1/First-case-of-COVID-19-transmission-inside-an-elevator)

A Korean church pastor was diagnosed as a covid-19 patient. Before that, he was in an elevator with a 41-year-old female and her two children for about a minute. Both the pastor and the woman were not wearing masks. Later, she tested positive. However, her two children wearing masks tested negative.

[https://www.yna.co.kr/view/AKR20200323137000065](https://www.yna.co.kr/view/AKR20200323137000065)

A nursing home was put into cohort isolation after a nurse’s aide tested positive for the new coronavirus and was found to have come into contact with some 180 people at the facility. However, all 299 people in the cohort isolation including patients, medical staffs, and employees turned out to test negative. The nurse's aide wore a mask and dental gloves on duty.

On the other hand, a woman attended a church service without wearing a mask and was turned out to be a covid-19 patient later. She infected 20 people there.

An icecream shop owner was diagnosed as a covid-19 patient. In his shop, he talked to a deliveryman who did not wear a mask for two minutes. The deliveryman tested positive later. He also talked to another deliveryman wearing a mask, who tested negative.

&#x200B;

In South Korea, the authority informs a new case to the public and one of the most important information is whether the infected wore a mask at a specific area.

Please, wear a mask, avoid crowded places, and wash your hands. If you do not have a mask, stay safe at home.

Looks like things in Iraq are [going to escalate!](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/27/world/middleeast/pentagon-iran-iraq-militias-coronavirus.html)

> WASHINGTON — The Pentagon has ordered military commanders to plan for an escalation of American combat in Iraq, issuing a directive last week to prepare a campaign to destroy an Iranian-backed militia group that has threatened more attacks against American troops.

> But the United States’ top commander in Iraq has warned that such a campaign could be bloody and counterproductive and risks war with Iran. In a blunt memo last week, the commander, Lt. Gen. Robert P. White, wrote that a new military campaign would also require thousands more American troops be sent to Iraq and divert resources from what has been the primary American military mission there: training Iraqi troops to combat the Islamic State.

> The Pentagon directive and General White’s response — both classified internal military communications — were described by several American officials with direct knowledge of their contents. The exchange comes amid a simmering fight inside the Trump administration over policy toward Iran and the course of America’s war in Iraq, which began just over 17 years ago.

> Some top officials, including Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Robert C. O’Brien, the national security adviser, have been pushing for aggressive new action against Iran and its proxy forces — and see an opportunity to try to destroy Iranian-backed militia groups in Iraq as leaders in Iran are distracted by the pandemic crisis in their country.

> Military leaders, including Defense Secretary Mark T. Esper and Gen. Mark A. Milley, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, have been wary of a sharp military escalation, warning it could further destabilize the Middle East at a time when President Trump has said he hopes to reduce the number of American troops in the region.

> Still, American officials said Mr. Esper authorized planning for a new campaign inside Iraq — even as the military reduces its counterterrorism presence there — to provide options for Mr. Trump in the event that Iranian-backed militia groups escalate their own attacks against American troops, said two senior administration officials.

> During an Oval Office meeting on March 19, Mr. Trump did not make a decision about whether he might authorize the new campaign in Iraq, but allowed the planning to continue, according to American officials.

> A spokesman for the National Security Council declined to comment. Cmdr. Sean Robertson, a Pentagon spokesman, said in a statement: “Operation Inherent Resolve is in Iraq at the invitation of the Iraqi government and remains focused on partnering with Iraqi security forces for the shared goal of permanently defeating ISIS remnants.

> The debate is happening as top Pentagon officials and senior commanders worldwide are also expressing growing concerns about coronavirus cases expanding rapidly in the ranks, potentially threatening the military’s ability to field combat-ready troops.

> Several American officials said they were struck by the blunt tone of General White’s memorandum — sent on March 16, the day after he received the Pentagon directive to start the planning — which they said emphasized the costs and risks against an effort to try to destroy the militia group, known as Kataib Hezbollah.

> The memo also pointed out that such a campaign might run afoul of the current agreement with the Iraqi government that allows American troops to operate in the country.

> Beyond that, it would most likely put the Iraqi leadership and especially its military in the position of having to choose between its American allies — whose leaders are far away — and the Iranians, whom many senior Iraqis do not like but believe they have to live with because they are neighbors."

This is a completely different situation. Here, some mexicans want to shut down incoming people from everywhere, including the US because of the lack of proper response to this pandemic in Mexico. Had Mexico been testing people coming in, checking temperature, making sure those with questionable conditions be put in quarantine and all the other measures other countries like Japan, South Korea and even China are/were taking, then the need for the average mexican citizen to raise their voice wouldn't exist.

Was going to cost too much, now looking at other options:

> The decision to cancel the announcement, government officials say, came after the Federal Emergency Management Agency said it needed more time to assess whether the estimated cost was prohibitive. That price tag was more than $1 billion, with several hundred million dollars to be paid upfront to General Motors to retool a car parts plant in Kokomo, Ind., where the ventilators would be made with Ventec’s technology.

> Government officials said that the deal might still happen but that they are examining at least a dozen other proposals. And they contend that an initial promise that the joint venture could turn out 20,000 ventilators in short order had shrunk to 7,500, with even that number in doubt.

Her husband had all the symptoms of COVID-19, she called the 1-800 number (which didn't work at all), then tried the health department who told her to take him to the ER, where the ER tried to make them leave and call the non-working 1-800 number. 

>""I said, 'I'm going to stand here in your lobby until someone of authority can get him help or tell me where to get help for him,'"" Carolyn recalls. 

>Security guards came, she says, but eventually, so did the head nurse. She agreed to talk to Carolyn, but only in the parking lot in case Carolyn was also contagious. 

>""She was kind of trying to direct me to the 800 number as well. And I said, 'Can you just look at him through the rolled-up window? He's right over there in the car. I want you to see how sick he is because I think if you see how sick he is, you're not going to turn us away,'"" Carolyn says. 

*He tests negative for everything else, finally gets a coronavirus test. Told the results will be back in 5 days. She begins getting sick. She calls the ER, the state lab, the county health department, who tells her they have no record of his test at all. They tell her to call the health department again* 

>""I'm exasperated, and I decided I'm going to call the governor's office,"" Carolyn says. 
>They got a caseworker who listened and was courteous, but there were no answers. 

>When the phone did ring, it was the hospital saying James' tests had been lost and he had to get tested again. But they didn't want him back at the hospital, promising instead to find a location and call her back. 

>James' lungs were getting worse, Carolyn says, ""and we're back to square one."" 

>I have so little faith in getting this resolved. All I really want at this point is a doctor's order so I can take him across state lines to get tested. 

>Carolyn decided they should just drive to Virginia. That state had recorded coronavirus cases, so surely there was a better system in place. As she called around to see what she needed, she got a call back from the West Virginia state lab: They had found James' samples. But they've been sitting in the lab for days, Carolyn was told. ""They're no longer viable,"" she recalls hearing. ""You have to get tested again."" 

>Tears began streaming down her face. She had no answer and no clear path forward. 

>Carolyn had been documenting the issues on Facebook. As she posted the latest update to their saga, a friend reached out with a connection to US Sen. Joe Manchin and said someone from his office would call her. The call came, says Carolyn, who shared all her information and got a promise that they'd get to the bottom of it that day. The senator's staffer asked for Carolyn to give them one day. She agreed. But just one. 

>Justice had closed the schools and declared a state of emergency, but because zero cases had been reported, Carolyn says people in the area were acting like there was no pandemic. 

>Then the office of the state's top health official called. They asked a lot of questions and promised a quick return call.

>That call back stunned Carolyn. They told her they had the test results: James had coronavirus. The first case in the last state in the land to report one. 

>The West Virginia department of health says James' test was misplaced by a shipping company. They say James was tested a second time. Carolyn says he was not. 

>Whether James was the first case or whether he was just the first to be confirmed amid testing issues is no longer top of mind for the Vigils. They just want things to be easier for the next patients. 

>And for Carolyn, it has been. She managed to get tested at a drive-through site on Wednesday. And two days later she was called with the result. 

>She's positive, too.

That's part of the point that I don't think gets across-- that if we did have a different president, we may have been better prepared. The president is frustrating because for every thing you can give his administration credit for, he does two or three things in a row that make you slap your forehead, but because he does the right thing occasionally, that's what ends up sticking in memory. And we also don't have a concise or easily explainable picture that explains the worldwide response. Other countries are going through pains, but there's been wide variation in how it's been mitigated, and you can say that the ones that have done better are those that started early. 

[You see articles like this](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2020-03-26/coronavirus-covid19-global-spread-data-explained/12089028) that are really in-depth, but they don't fit into a soundbite, and what do they matter to the worker who's about to go on unemployment?

As an adult my weight has fluctuated pretty wildly up and down. As most people will tell you, losing weight is easy. Keeping it off is hard. That’s definitely my experience. 

I’ve been on an upward trajectory for a while but at the beginning of February I decided enough was enough and I got on the stationary bike I’ve owned for years and started watching what I eat (and drink) and since then I’ve lost nearly 10kgs. Two weeks into this I bought a set of dumbbells and have been completing [ACHV PEAK](https://youtu.be/v2vLQiU8lJQ) workouts (they may be good or bad I have no idea?). 

The timing of the decision to lose weight and get healthier probably couldn’t have come at a better time. There’s no way I could waltz into Big W today and buy dumbbells. The weight loss also definitely improves the underlying condition I have which makes COVID-19 life threatening to me. It also means I’m eating less food so have less need to buy groceries. I’ve also lost all of the incidental exercise I used to get walking to and from work four times a day. Which for a while was my only exercise. It also means if I do get coronavirus and die, at least the crematorium can use less fuel than they would have had to otherwise. 

I guess the point of this is for those who have lost their incidental or deliberate exercise it’s super important you find something. If you’re not fortunate enough to have exercise equipment at home, there’s plenty of alternatives floating around on the internet. It’s a nice distraction from worrying about Pandemic 2020. 

Anyway here ends the significant over share."

Another mad news day. In the UK the Chief Medical Officer Chris Witty, the Health Secretary Matt Hancock and the Prime Minister are now all isolating with symptoms. Hancock and Johnson have both tested positive. This comes as we have the largest daily spike in deaths recorded so far; 181 today, raising the total to 759, it appears we’re now at the point in which hundreds will be dying daily. This comes as the government announce that they will be mass testing frontline health staff, starting over the weekend but mainly beginning next week. The testing is of course vital, but time is precious and the delay could be fatal for many considering the speed at which the virus is spreading and the apparent widespread and diverse nature of who it is infecting.

In the US the stimulus package has been signed into law whilst Trump has publicly attacked, in his idiosyncratic twitter-laden way, General Motors for failing to meet the requirements needed in developing the ventilators urgently needed. Indeed as of writing it has been announced that Trump has invoked the Defence Production act, which allows the federal government to largely take charge of economic production during times of crisis, to address these challenges. Massive economic intervention from Republicans and large wellfare relief from UK Conservatives are showing just how unprecedented these times are.

In Italy it was today announced that 919 people have died of coronavirus within the last 24 hours, having lingered around the 6-7 hundred mark for the past few days I’d hoped we’d begin to start to see the beginning of a decline however those hopes appear naive now. To put the numbers into perspective regarding the scale of the current European epidemic, the worst documented day for deaths that China had saw 150 deaths. Images are flooding the internet and the media, warehouses full of coffins, the dead being moved by industrial machinery operated by people in specialist equipment, army convoys carrying hundreds off to be cremated. The sort of imagery of mass death the vast majority of mainland Europeans have no living memory of, scenes we thought had been left in history books or places far off that only exist on our TV screens and in situations most of us don’t bother looking into, partly out of hopeless optimism but largely down to the ignorance our culture of detached relative luxury has for fully comprehending humanitarian crises.

Logarithmically, the crisis in Spain continues at a rate which will see it surpass that of Italy (as does the US according to latest cases figures). 769 were announced dead today however Spanish health chiefs are claiming, in terms of the infection rate, that case numbers are ‘stabilising’. Whether these claims are cause for optimism or a statistical manipulation aimed at promoting calm remains to be seen and is beyond the knowledge of most to be able to provide meaningful analysis. One thing that sticks out for a layman like myself is the disparity between how severe the crisis is hitting state by state, Germany for instance is recording death rates startingly lower than that of the other majorly effected countries. A lot of analysis suggests, confirming the WHO’s testing recommendation, that this is mainly down to the country’s policy of rigorous testing to all sections of the population. As heroic as the work being done by those in healthcare is, the ultimate key to fighting covid-19 lies in detecting it as early as possible and limiting the infected’s interactions as much as possible. A lot of powerful (and indeed civillian) people should be held accountable for whether they adhere or fail to follow the expert recommendations now proving to be vital to saving lives.

 Most African nations now have documented cases, raising the concerns I mentioned yesterday as to how equipped they will be to handle the crisis. South Africa have instilled tough measures to enforce lockdown in the early days of the spread, but being one of Africa’s more economically prosperous nations they may not prove a good model when projecting how the pandemic will spread on the rest of the continent. The figures from the most war and poverty stricken African nations, once the spread begins to hit, could very well prove catastrophic.

The takeaway from the day though is that for Europe, the figures are continuing to rise and for Britain we are days away from losing hundreds daily, largely on par with Italy and Spain.

Uk Cases stand at 13,649 Deaths stand at 759

Worldwide cases stand at 590,506, Deaths stand at 26,952"

One in particular is Even More News, from the same folks who do Some More News on YouTube (Cody Johnston & Katy Stoll, plus occasional guests), which again if you don’t know is primarily about US politics.

This week’s episode was I think the second or third they’ve done from their homes (I believe in California, which is hit pretty bad). For a bit of background: Cody is the face of the YouTube channel, and both there and on his twitter he’s very sarcastic and always seems very quick-witted and ready to go. But today on the podcast he was asked how he was doing, and he kinda.. broke down, for lack of a more sensitive phrase, and I think that’s the first time the gravity of the situation has really hit me.

Again I’m from the UK where we probably won’t be hit as hard as the US, but to hear someone who always seemed kinda on-top of things actually sound scared is really disconcerting and eye-opening. If anyone here is struggling mentally with this situation, please know that you are not alone, and it’s ok and totally understandable to feel down. We’ll get through this.

By [Philip Bump](https://www.washingtonpost.com/people/philip-bump/) March 27, 2020 at 10:01 a.m. PDT

Millions of Americans continue to live under state-ordered shelter-in-place orders, an effort to contain the spread of the [coronavirus](https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2020/02/28/what-you-need-know-about-coronavirus/?tid=lk_inline_manual_2&itid=lk_inline_manual_2) that’s infected nearly 90,000 people. By containing the spread, officials hope to both better understand the scope of the virus’s spread and reduce the strain on hospitals due to an influx of new cases.

Alabama Gov. Kay Ivey (R) doesn’t feel any sense of urgency about implementing a similar order in her state.

“Y’all, we are not Louisiana, we are not New York State, we are not California,” she [said](https://www.montgomeryadvertiser.com/story/news/2020/03/26/coronavirus-ivey-says-right-now-not-time-statewide-shelter-place-order/2922242001/) on Thursday. “Right now is not the time to order people to shelter in place.”

In terms of raw case totals, that’s true. Data from [Johns Hopkins University](https://www.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html#/bda7594740fd40299423467b48e9ecf6) compiled through Thursday show that Alabama’s case total is in the hundreds, compared to thousands of cases in Louisiana and California and tens of thousands in New York.

[Image without a caption](https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/MFEQLELM6FC75GUTH7X4RSKPDE.png&w=1440)

But, again, the concern which shelter-in-place orders are meant to address is the *spread* of the virus. And on that metric, things in Alabama don’t compare quite as well.

On the graph below, lines which increase more rapidly (have a steeper slope) have seen faster spreads since the tenth recorded case in that state. It’s hard to tell, but Alabama’s line is rising faster than California’s.

Over the past seven days, the number of confirmed cases in California has increased by an average of 22 percent each day. The number of cases in Louisiana has grown by an average of 29 percent. In New York, the rate has averaged 33 percent — slightly higher than the 32 percent average increase in Alabama.

In other words, the virus has been spreading nearly as fast in Alabama as in New York over the past week. The number of cases in New York from March 19 to March 26 grew by more than 32,000, a 606 percent increase. In Alabama, only 439 new cases were added in that period, but that was a spike of 563 percent.

Remember that New York is also more populous than Alabama. This has been a subtext to a lot of the debate over how to limit the spread of the virus, an assumption that less densely populated places have something of a defense against it. If we control for population, though, we see that Alabama’s adding new cases relative to its population faster than New York did. Not as fast as Louisiana, but quickly.

As you probably noticed, Alabama is adding confirmed cases far more quickly than California. What might not stand out on that graph is that, relative to population, Alabama’s confirmed case totals are actually *higher* than California’s.

About 10.5 people have been confirmed to have the virus for every 100,000 Alabama residents. About 9.9 out of every 100,000 Californians have.

We tend to consider the spread of the virus relative not to when it emerged in a region but when it became a focus of the country broadly. Alabama’s got fewer confirmed cases now in part because it didn’t have any confirmed cases until later than other states.

It may also be in part because it has conducted fewer tests relative to its population. As of the end of the day on Wednesday, Alabama ranked 40th in terms of the number of tests it had conducted per 100,000 residents.

New York and Louisiana have scaled up testing quickly. California’s conducted far more tests than other states, but comparably few relative to its population. It’s still outpacing Alabama, though. (The graph below is adapted from an [analysis of all 50 states](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2020/03/26/trumps-plan-categorize-counties-coronavirus-risk-has-some-immediately-obvious-challenges/?tid=lk_inline_manual_22&itid=lk_inline_manual_22) that published on Thursday.)

The coronavirus cases in California are centered in the San Francisco Bay area. Much of the rest of the state has relatively few cases, even as a function of population. In more-compact Alabama, the number of cases as a function of population is higher in the more northern and eastern counties.

Some areas in the state, like Tuscaloosa, already have [shelter-in-place orders](https://www.al.com/news/tuscaloosa/2020/03/maddox-extends-tuscaloosas-curfew-to-24-hours-citing-rapidly-developing-situation.html), a function of local leadership. Ivey’s dismissal of a broader need to limit social interactions may, in part, be a function of where such orders are already in place.

Comparing the state more generally to California, though, misrepresents the scale and growth rate of the virus in Alabama."

As I’m sure we all know, the virus mutation was first found and classified in bats a few years ago. While there is a lot of hoopla around the animal market in Wuhan, the first confirmed patient with COVID-19 had *no* contact with that market. There’s a good chance it was already spreading in the community prior to his diagnosis.

Think back to December/January. There were thousands of people in the US who contracted an upper respiratory virus that was particularly difficult to treat and many doctors brushed it off as nothing more than a “super bug” because COVID-19 had not yet been sent out as an alert to the medical community.

The emphasis at this time is treating those who have contracted it and creating a vaccine for those of us who have not. At some point, when our medical and research capacities are less taxed, they will be able to go back and look at the antibodies of those who died from the “super bug” and determine if they in fact had undiagnosed COVID-19 months prior to the first case in China.

Because there is so much information the medical community still needs to learn about this pandemic, calling it anything other than “coronavirus” or “COVID-19” is simply inaccurate."

Though Covid-19 often begins as an upper respiratory tract infection, with cough and sore throat, coronavirus can trek down the throat and enter the lower respiratory tract. There, it damages the lung’s tiny air sacs — called alveoli — which are where oxygen enters the blood and carbon dioxide leaves.

As a result of this damage, inflammatory cells and fluid flood the alveoli. This makes it harder for oxygen to travel from the lungs into the bloodstream and deprives the organs of the oxygen that is necessary for them to function. You might hear this referred to as acute respiratory distress syndrome, or ARDS — that’s a term for rapid and extensive lung damage that compromises the body’s oxygen supply during a severe pneumonia.


--------------

The Coronavirus pandemic ARDS symptoms sound like the ""fluid in the lungs"" from the 1918 pandemic. Both were new viruses never before experienced by humans.  
If we didn't have respirators and modern medicine it would have been so much worse ( as bad as it is already.)

https://www.archives.gov/exhibits/influenza-epidemic/


Others succumbed after a few days; their lungs filled with fluid and they suffocated to death.

https://www.livescience.com/spanish-flu.html

Initial symptoms of the illness included a sore head and tiredness, followed by a dry, hacking cough; a loss of appetite; stomach problems; and then, on the second day, excessive sweating. Next, the illness could affect the respiratory organs, and pneumonia could develop. Humphries explains that pneumonia, or other respiratory complications brought about by the flu, were often the main causes of death. This explains why it is difficult to determine exact numbers killed by the flu, as the listed cause of death was often something other than the flu."

>	Thus, I am writing to let you know that pursuant to the faculty’s unanimous determination, for this semester only, we will be utilizing a mandatory Pass/Fail grading system for all of our JD and in-person LLM students. For each class that you take, Pass or Fail will be noted on your transcript, together with the words “Mandatory Pass/Fail Due to Coronavirus Pandemic” or words to similar effect.

So I called my GP again and they said to take my temperature but I don't have a thermometer. I told them I would go get one and they said not to leave my house or go to A&E so then I asked how am I supposed to know my temperature if I don't have a thermometer?

You have to wonder what the guy’s real priority is going to be when he is pressed to make a decision about pulling the trigger on it.

A lockdown is coming one way or another though. They can do it now and suffer great economic damage, or wait until the hospitals are full of dying people, be forced to do the lockdown anyway, and suffer enormous economic damage."

Positive Ireland signs
It was predicted earlier this month that Ireland would have 15,000 coronavirus cases by the end of March.

This was factoring in a 30% increase in confirmed Covid-19 cases each day starting from March 18 - with the potential for over 100,000 cases by April 10 if the curve wasn't flattened.

However, the average daily growth since March 18 has been 24% which has already seen a considerable change in graph predictions.

Fast forward to April 10 and instead of having 121,000 plus cases here in the Republic if a 30% increase was to continue, a 24% daily rise would see a little over 49,000 cases.

Italy decline

Italy is the epicentre of the virus at the moment and the number of deaths continues to surge each day.

However, in some much needed positive news there, case numbers have been declining for the past four days.

Over 7,500 people have died in the European country but with a decline in cases it is hoped that Italy is overcoming the worst period.

Spanish scientists said the rapid tests for coronavirus they reviewed were less than 30 per cent accurate. The more established lab tests were about 84 per cent accurate.

The issue is that people are comparing the tests. The PCR and antibody test are completely different and work for different purposes. 

PCR identifies actively sick patients while antibody test identifies antibodies built up from the virus. Of course your antibodies may not build up during the virus. So the antibody will never be a good way to diagnosis actively sick patients.

For example, the CDC estimates that from Oct 1 to March 1 there were 24,000 - 62,000 deaths from the flu, but when you consider that there were  38,000,000-54,000,000 total cases, that puts the fatality rate at around 0.1%. 

Right now, the numbers for coronavirus look MUCH worse- 1.5%. 100,000 confirmed cases and 1,500 fatalities. That's terrible. But as we test more, we may find the number of confirmed cases starts to rise much faster than fatalities and that % drops a bit.

Wishing death on him is wishing life and well-being on thousands, if not millions of others.

This is exactly it. 

There are some people so dangerous, so harmful, and with a clear malicious intent to continue causing harm, that the world as a whole is a better place without them in it.  Sure, an individual human life may have value by virtue of the fact it is a human life (a moral premise I wouldn't normally grant as true without further argument, but it's not really the point here so I'll grant it for the sake of brevity)... but we're weighing one life against literally millions of others that would undergo immense suffering and loss.  

It's a classic trolley problem: One Trump versus the tens of thousands who will die of Coronavirus.  

It would have been a moral good for Trump to have died two years ago so a competent person could be in charge right now without a disbanded pandemic response team.  And knowing that Trump is incompetent and has malicious intent to cause further harm if left in power... it is a moral good *anytime* he dies before he's able to bring that harm to fruition.

>I'm wishing death on a man who put kids in cages, raped a 13-year-old girl while she pleaded with him to stop, left thousands of our Kurdish allies to die, and bungled the response to COVID-19 which has killed a thousand Americans and will have killed more Americans than 9/11 before it is over.

**Question**:  Could administration of convalescent plasma transfusion be beneficial in the treatment of critically ill patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)?

**Findings**:  In this uncontrolled case series of 5 critically ill patients with COVID-19 and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), administration of convalescent plasma containing neutralizing antibody was followed by an improvement in clinical status.

**Meaning**:  These preliminary findings raise the possibility that convalescent plasma transfusion may be helpful in the treatment of critically ill patients with COVID-19 and ARDS, but this approach requires evaluation in randomized clinical trials.

[...]

**Results:**  All 5 patients (age range, 36-65 years; 2 women) were receiving mechanical ventilation at the time of treatment and all had received antiviral agents and methylprednisolone. Following plasma transfusion, body temperature normalized within 3 days in 4 of 5 patients, the SOFA score decreased, and Pao2/Fio2 increased within 12 days (range, 172-276 before and 284-366 after). Viral loads also decreased and became negative within 12 days after the transfusion, and SARS-CoV-2–specific ELISA and neutralizing antibody titers increased following the transfusion (range, 40-60 before and 80-320 on day 7). ARDS resolved in 4 patients at 12 days after transfusion, and 3 patients were weaned from mechanical ventilation within 2 weeks of treatment. Of the 5 patients, 3 have been discharged from the hospital (length of stay: 53, 51, and 55 days), and 2 are in stable condition at 37 days after transfusion.

A few paragraphs from the acompanying editorial in JAMA: [Convalescent Plasma to Treat COVID-19, Possibilities and Challenges](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2763982):

> In this issue of JAMA, Shen et al report findings from a preliminary study of 5 severely ill patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) who were treated in the Shenzhen Third People's Hospital, China, using plasma from recovered individuals.1 All patients had severe respiratory failure and were receiving mechanical ventilation; 1 needed extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) and 2 had bacterial and/or fungal pneumonia. Four patients without coexisting diseases received convalescent plasma around hospital day 20, and a patient with hypertension and mitral valve insufficiency received the plasma transfusion at day 10. The donor plasma had demonstrable IgG and IgM anti–SARS-CoV-19 antibodies and neutralized the virus in in vitro cultures. Although these patients continued to receive antiviral treatment primarily with lopinavir/ritonavir and interferon, the use of convalescent plasma may have contributed to their recovery because the clinical status of all patients had improvement approximately 1 week after transfusion, as evidenced by normalization of body temperature as well as improvements in Sequential Organ Failure Assessment scores and Pao2/Fio2 ratio. In addition, the patients’ neutralizing antibody titers increased and respiratory samples tested negative for SARS-CoV-2 between 1 and 12 days after transfusion.

> Even though the cases in the report by Shen et al are compelling and well-studied, this investigation has important limitations that are characteristic of other “anecdotal” case series. The intervention, administration of convalescent plasma, was not evaluated in a randomized clinical trial, and the outcomes in the treatment group were not compared with outcomes in a control group of patients who did not receive the intervention. Therefore, it is not possible to determine the true clinical effect of this intervention or whether patients might have recovered without this therapy. In addition, patients received numerous other therapies (including antiviral agents and steroids), making it impossible to disentangle the specific contribution of convalescent plasma to the clinical course or outcomes. Moreover, convalescent plasma was administered up to 3 weeks after hospital admission, and it is unclear whether this timing is optimal or if earlier administration might have been associated with different clinical outcomes. Despite these limitations, the study does provide some evidence to support the possibility of evaluating this well-known therapy in more rigorous investigations involving patients with COVID-19 and severe illness.

> The use of convalescent plasma is not new; it was used for severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), pandemic 2009 influenza A (H1N1), avian influenza A (H5N1), several hemorrhagic fevers such as Ebola, and other viral infections. For instance, in 2005, Cheng et al reported outcomes of patients who received convalescent plasma in Hong Kong during the 2003 SARS outbreak.2 Although this investigation was not a randomized trial, of 1775 patients, the 80 who received convalescent plasma had a lower mortality rate (12.5%) compared with the overall SARS-related mortality for admitted patients (n = 299 [17%]). The antibody titers and plasma transfusion volumes varied and did not appear to correlate with clinical response; however, patients receiving transfusion within 14 days of symptom onset (n = 33) had better outcomes. No adverse events were reported among patients receiving convalescent plasma."

>So why is our Government incompetent? Let's start with the obvious. On February 3 the Government implemented ""temporary entry restrictions into New Zealand on all foreign nationals travelling from, or transiting through mainland China to assist with the containment of the novel coronavirus and to protect New Zealand and the Pacific Islands from the disease"".

>This was the time for a blanket ban on all entries except for New Zealanders, who should have been tested for coronavirus on arrival and then quarantined – not isolated – until clearance was given from the lab.

Even with perfect hindsight this policy would have been excessive - there really were so few cases outside of China on February 3 to make such an extreme measure worthwhile at that time, even if we could anticipate needing such a policy in the future.

Without hindsight (which was obviously the situation at the time), it's insane. Consistently applied, it would suggest we should have shut the borders pretty much every time there was an outbreak of infectious disease anywhere in the world (which is pretty often!) Such a policy would almost destroy our tourism industry and make NZers reluctant to travel for fear of being quarantined the next time sometime coughs in China or Saudi Arabia.

People who develop symptoms do so after about 5 days.

If the virus has a growth rate of >15% (which is low for Coronavirus, look at the charts) then it has a doubling time of <5 days.

If your number of cases are doubling every 5 days, when you test, 50% of your population have had it less than 5 days and are presymptomatic and should be expected to develop symptoms after 5 days like everyone else.

If they find 50% asymptomatic in areas with a growth curve of well under 15%/day then I'll believe that there are a ton of asymptomatic carriers running around. But so far every one of these studies/tials I've seen has been entirely consistent with most people becoming symptomatic at \~5 days and 98%+ by 2 weeks and entirely inconsistent with having large numbers of entirely asymptomatic carriers, despite peoples' rush to interpret the data to the contrary without really thinking about what it means."

2020-03-27,ForRocky,Coronavirus,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/fq9bot/covid19_linked_to_cardiac_injury_worse_outcomes/flp9nhe/,"COVID-19 can have fatal consequences for people with underlying cardiovascular disease and cause cardiac injury even in patients without underlying heart conditions, according to a review published today in JAMA Cardiology by experts at The University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston (UTHealth).

Experts have known that viral illnesses such as COVID-19 can cause respiratory infections that may lead to lung damage and even death in severe cases. Less is known about the effects on the cardiovascular system.

""It is likely that even in the absence of previous heart disease, the heart muscle can be affected by coronavirus disease,"" said Mohammad Madjid, MD, MS, the study's lead author and an assistant professor of cardiology at McGovern Medical School at UTHealth. ""Overall, injury to heart muscle can happen in any patient with or without heart disease, but the risk is higher in those who already have heart disease.""

The study authors explained that research from previous coronavirus and influenza epidemics suggest that viral infections can cause acute coronary syndromes, arrhythmias, and the development of, or exacerbation of, heart failure.

In a clinical bulletin issued by the American College of Cardiology, it was revealed that the case fatality rate of COVID-19 for patients with cardiovascular disease was 10.5%. Data also points to a greater likelihood that individuals over the age of 65 with coronary heart disease or hypertension can contract the illness, as well experience more severe symptoms that will require critical care.

According to the study authors, critical cases are those that reported respiratory failure, septic shock, and/or multiple organ dysfunction or failure that resulted in death. ""It is reasonable to expect that significant cardiovascular complications linked to COVID-19 will occur in severe symptomatic patients because of the high inflammatory response associated with this illness,"" said Madjid, who also sees patients at the UT Physicians Multispecialty -- Bayshore clinic.

The novel virus that causes COVID-19 was first identified in January 2020. This novel virus originated in Wuhan, China, and by March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization had declared it a global pandemic. The three most common symptoms of COVID-19 include fever, cough, and shortness of breath. Other less common symptoms are muscle pain, sore throat, nasal congestion, and headache. Symptoms can appear as soon as two days after exposure to the virus to up to14 days after. There is a high viral load in both symptomatic and asymptomatic patients, meaning asymptomatic spread between person to person is likely.

Previously identified coronaviruses known to cause severe illness in humans include Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS-CoV). SARS-CoV was first identified in southern China in 2002, and by 2003 it had killed over 8,000 individuals in 29 countries. Data suggests that SARS-CoV may have resulted in cardiovascular complications, such as acute coronary syndrome and myocardial infarction. MERS-CoV was first discovered in 2012 in Saudi Arabia. As of 2019, 2,494 cases have been confirmed along with 858 deaths in 26 countries.

Current COVID-19 treatment options are being researched, and there is a large effort to develop vaccines for prevention and to test antivirals for the treatment of the disease. In the meantime, the study authors encourage all individuals to consult with their health care providers about being vaccinated against influenza and that at-risk patients seek advice on receiving a pneumonia vaccine from their primary care physician. While these vaccines will not provide specific protection against COVID-19, they can help prevent superimposed infections alongside COVID-19."

February 28: “Now the Democrats are politicizing the coronavirus, you know that, right? Coronavirus, they’re politicizing it. We did one of the great jobs.

March 6: “I like this stuff. I really get it. People are surprised that I understand it… Every one of these doctors said, ‘How do you know so much about this?’ Maybe I have a natural ability. Maybe I should have done that instead of running for president.”

March 6: “I don't need to have the numbers double because of one ship that wasn't our fault.”

March 8: “We have a perfectly coordinated and fine tuned plan at the White House for our attack on CoronaVirus.”

March 9: “This blindsided the world.”

March 22: “It is absolutely critical that Americans continue to follow the federal government’s guidelines. So important about social distancing, non-essential travel, and hand-washing.”

March 23: Democratic concerns have focused on a $500 billion funding program Republicans want to create for loans and loan guarantees, with some Democrats calling it a “slush fund” that lacks any oversight because the Treasury Department would have broad discretion over who receives the money. Asked about this Monday evening, Trump responded, “I’ll be the oversight.” The vote Monday was 49 to 46, well short of the 60-vote threshold needed to advance the legislation for a final debate.

^This.

From reports I have seen though. GM originally said they could make much more ventilators, but instead backtracked and said they could make a fraction of what they originally mentioned, for the set price point discussed originally.

So I wonder what GM does now?

Edit:

>“As usual with ‘this’ General Motors, things just never seem to work out,” Trump tweeted. “They said they were going to give us 40,000 much needed Ventilators, ‘very quickly’. Now they are saying it will only be 6000, in late April, and they want top dollar. Always a mess with Mary B. Invoke ‘P’.”
He followed up in a tweet, Trump said the meaning of “Invoke P” was referring to invoking the Defense Production Act.

**It is going to be extremely interesting to see how this plays out. GM already said they would need funds to retool factory machinery to allow for this.**

**Can the government force them to make equipment they have no tooling for? Can GM stall until ventilator production isn't as necessary?**

Droplet pathogens only pass and survive in larger drops of water. They don’t stay suspended in the air very long. They’re only a real danger when doing an aerosolizing procedure such as intimidation, bipap, a nebulizer treatment, etc.  when that happens you wear an n95 mask. For droplet precautions you wear a regular surgical mask. You may or may not need a splash shield.

Airborne precautions require hepa filters, a negative pressure room, and n95 masks or a closed system such as CAPR or PAPR. An airborne pathogen like smallpox or viral meningitis hangs suspended in the air for large amounts of time. 

SARS is an airborne virus. It’s called SARS-COV.

Coronavirus aka covid-19 aka SARS-COV-2 is being labeled as a droplet virus. I suspect this was done by the CDC and WHO simply because there’s just not enough PPE in the world right now to adequately protect healthcare workers. I believe that they’re pretending it’s droplet/aerosol instead of airborne for political and financial reasons. This pisses me off."

And let's also remember the common cold does not have a cure or prevention measure other than a healthy immune system and washing your hands.

I think MERS and Sars actually mutated itself into nothingness but I can't remember very well. 

I don't really know much about science though this is just from what I'm reading. Also, basically I would have thought if you had anti-bodies in you, if the virus randomly mutated to be worse so fast, that the anti-bodies would protect you in some way from the severity.

Shanghai Shenhua plan to rebuff any attempt from Manchester United to extend Odion Ighalo’s loan move and will insist that the club must sign the Nigeria striker on a permanent deal instead.

Ighalo, 30, has performed well for United since they signed him on a four-month loan deal from his parent club in China on the final day of the January transfer window.

He has scored four goals for the club, at an average of one goal per 80 minutes, which is better than his fellow forwards Marcus Rashford, Anthony Martial and Mason Greenwood.

The coronavirus epidemic has presented United with a conundrum regarding the forward, however, as his loan deal expires on May 31. Given that the season is now likely to run beyond that point, United must make a decision about what to do with the former Watford striker.

It had been suggested that United were considering trying to extend Ighalo’s loan until the end of the English season but it is understood that Shanghai are unwilling to do that. They want United to stump up the cash for a permanent deal. It is thought that Shanghai are demanding a fee in the region of £15 million for Ighalo, who left Watford in 2017 to join Changchun Yatai, where he spent two years before Shanghai signed him.

Ighalo is desperate to join United on a free transfer. He is presently realising a childhood dream by playing for the club he has supported since he was young. Ighalo has made a good impression on the coaching staff since he moved to Old Trafford. He has added physicality and robustness to the forward line whenever he has played and his presence within the squad has given the manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer the opportunity to rest Martial, his first-choice striker.

Solskjaer appeared to indicate that Ighalo was playing his way towards a permanent deal two weeks ago after he scored a stunning goal against LASK Linz in the Europa League. “He has qualities we saw in him and needed and we need those qualities for next season,” the Norwegian said.

Solskjaer had intended to bring in a striker at the end of the present campaign — Moussa Dembélé, of Lyons, was of interest to him — but it remains to be seen whether that would still be the case if Ighalo’s deal becomes permanent.

United have other priorities, such as a right winger, and a central midfielder.

David De Gea, the United goalkeeper, last night donated €300,000 (about £270,000) to help the fight against coronavirus in his home town of Madrid."

2.  For those of you who have yet to complete your sub-internships, options #1 and #2 will count towards your graduation requirements. 
3.  For example, our hospitals have assured us that each of our students will have appropriate personal protective equipment, you will be re-trained in their use, you will be supervised by appropriate faculty and that your safety— and that of all care providers—is paramount.

Part of your thesis suggests the fed is going to crush the dollar, which I agree with. I think this is going to happen much quicker than anticipated.... they are just throwing everything and seeing what sticks.

Fighting the fed seems like it's more difficult this time around. 

CB swaps are helping the liquidity issues overseas. They are sitting at about 200B right now and in the great financial crisis it hit a peak of about 600B. Could be temporary, but who knows.... there is of course, much greater issues to liquidity overseas, but as always there is a possibility of things reversing.

Similar viral load in asymptomatic versus symptomatic cases was reported in a study including 18 patients[38]. Persistent positivity of viral RNA in throat and anal swabs were reported in a asymptomatic female patient after 17 days of clinical observation and treatment[39].  Potential transmission from an asymptomatic person has been reported in a familial cluster of five COVID-19 patients hospitalised with fever and respiratory symptoms that had contact before their onset of symptoms with an asymptomatic family member, a young 20-year-old woman, upon her return from Wuhan [40].She remained asymptomatic for the whole duration of laboratory and clinical monitoring (19 days).

Des centaines de milliers de masques dans des stocks dormants : Castaner ne pourra pas dire qu'il ne savait pas...

4-5 minutes

« On est en train d’envoyer des soignants se tuer au travail alors qu’il y a des stocks de masques qui attendent à côté. » Fabrice Coudour est écœuré. Dans son réseau de syndicalistes, il a recensé des centaines de milliers de masques et de matériels de protection stockés, en attente d’être récupérés… depuis le 13 mars. Ce jour-là, un décret a été publié par l’État pour réagir en catastrophe à l’épidémie du coronavirus. « Eu égard à la nature de la situation sanitaire et afin d’en assurer la disponibilité ainsi qu’un accès prioritaire aux professionnels de santé et aux patients », stipule le texte, les stocks de masques respiratoires et anti-projections détenus par les entreprises « sont réquisitionnés, jusqu’au 31 mai 2020 ». Mais quels sont ces stocks détenus par les sociétés publiques et privées ? En 2013, pour réaliser des économies, l’État a décidé de transférer la responsabilité des pouvoirs publics aux employeurs dans la gestion de masques pour protéger leurs personnels. L’État évite ainsi les coûts d’entreposage. Mais une crise comme celle-ci met en évidence les limites de cette stratégie grippe-sou : pas de logistique coordonnée et des milliers de masques qui dorment aux quatre coins de la France, éparpillés dans une multitude de dépôts, notamment dans les entreprises de l’énergie et de l’industrie.

« Tout est là mais on ne peut y toucher »

« Dans l’énergie, nous avons besoin d’une certaine quantité de protections pour maintenir les services publics de l’électricité et du gaz, précise Fabrice Coudour, élu CGT et secrétaire d’un CSE d’EDF de Savoie. Mais aujourd’hui, il subsiste de gros volumes de masques qui ne nous appartiennent plus car l’État les a réquisitionnés. J’en ai vu. Les stocks sont là. On ne peut plus y toucher, mais personne n’est venu les chercher. Samedi dernier, nous l’avons signalé par écrit au préfet. Cinq jours plus tard, nous n’avons toujours pas de son ni d’image en retour. » De nombreuses filiales d’EDF confirment un stock similaire de masques, combinaisons, gants abandonnés dans des hangars qui pourraient être acheminés aux soignants, personnels de secours criant à la pénurie et aux manques de protection. « À Enedis, nous avons eu des cas de légionellose (infection respiratoire - NDLR) il y a quelques années, complète Jérôme Bation, de la CGT Rhône-Alpes. Nous avons acheté alors beaucoup de masques qui ne nous sont plus utiles dans l’immédiat. » Pour autant, l’État n’a pas organisé de ramassage massif ici comme ailleurs.

La CGT rappelle Castaner à l’ordre

Dans le secteur de la chimie, la CGT de Sanofi a interpellé la direction après avoir appris l’existence de 280 000 masques FFP2 en réserve, datant de la crise sanitaire du H1N1 mais non périmés. « Nous sommes intervenus la semaine dernière quand nous avons eu connaissance de ce stock pour demander qu’une partie soit transmise aux professionnels de santé et aux hôpitaux, détaille Thierry Bodin, délégué CGT. Au bout de quatre jours, le 23 mars, nous avons enfin obtenu une réponse mais négative concernant les hôpitaux. Pour autant, la direction a affirmé qu’une partie des masques allait partir vers nos usines. » Or, sur de nombreux sites de production de Sanofi, les masques faisaient toujours défaut ce jeudi.

Comment comptabiliser les stocks existants ? Comment récupérer les protections réquisitionnées ? Face à cette gabegie, la fédération des services publics CGT a écrit au ministre de l’Intérieur Christophe Castaner, mercredi soir, qui ne peut désormais ignorer l’existence de centaines de milliers de masques et de protections non collectés."

Today I’m sure you noticed we stalled at specific prices on our way up, $255, $257 and $260. Those prices were the “resistance”, and when you break through a resistance price the stock price goes upwards towards the next resistance.

At EOD, we drilled from a high of $260 all the way down to around $252/253, thus blowing through TWO supports ($255 and $257) 

Stocks don’t go straight down. They can drill for a while but not for long, they must go up eventually. 

We are not in the same market we were in when the coronavirus scare first began. Volume is much lower,
and “stable” in a way. Still volatile af, but less volume makes these dramatic swings less likely to happen in a short period of time like the last 3 weeks. 

So why will it be green at first? Normal everyday people will see today’s close as a buying opportunity on Monday. They may think stocks are on sale and they’re just “Buying the dip”. Not a bad idea, but they’re too early. These buyers will bring us to the last support we broke through ($255) and we’ll drill down from there on to the $247 support. 

Note, the open can also be RED, but we will rally to around $255, then drop from there towards the $247 support. 

The MMs showed us the future. They do not believe our market should go above today’s high. This virus will get worse and they are now in the process of pricing it in.

You ever hear of “buy the rumor sell the news”? This drill is the rumor. We passed the stim bill today in the house so “WHY DID WE DROP?!”. It’s because this bill is priced in already. Anyone buying now is buying the news. They will lose. 


In conclusion/TLDR: Stonks go up and down. Price action today suggests that $260 was too high to break through. MMs and other investors knew this and waited till the end to dump. Today was basically a giant bull trap. 

On Monday they will do the same but it’ll happen rapidly at open. We will have another bull trap all the way up to the last resistance ($255) then start drilling from there to $247 and below. I expect this next week to be red and green with a trend going towards SPY $180 by the end of April. 

This is not to be taken as fact. Please do your own research and don’t take this as financial advice. I may be wrong even though I’m highly confident. Good luck brotha! Apologies for the essay!"

>It’s Thursday morning, March 19 — four weeks into the coronavirus crash of 2020. The Dow Jones industrial average has opened down another 700 points, after plunging below 20,000 a day before. It’s down 30 percent in a month, the steepest drop ever, even worse than during the Great Depression.  
>  
>The fall has been nauseating. Yet I know this is a time to be buying stocks based on rules I’ve developed over decades of investing. But in order to do that, I have to log on to my brokerage account. When I do, the first number I’ll see is the current market value of my portfolio.

>  
>I’m paralyzed.  
>  
>I’ve owned stocks for nearly 40 years. I’ve lived through, survived and even prospered through four crashes.  
>  
>So I should be prepared. Yet, looking back at the last few weeks, I recognize that I’ve violated most of my time-tested rules. Whipsawed between optimism and despair as the bad news mounted and my daily life was upended, I’ve let emotions influence my decisions. I’m doing it again this morning.  
>  
>An unfathomable fall  
>  
>I first bought a stock mutual fund during the summer of 1982, as soon as I’d saved enough money to invest. My father, a Cadillac-driving sales manager for NBC’s local TV and radio affiliates, had been an avid believer in the stock market, and he’d drummed his faith into me.  
>  
>It turned out that 1982 was a great year to buy, not that I realized it at the time. For years, I enjoyed the positive reinforcement of a steadily rising market. I loved looking up my mutual fund in the newspaper stock tables. Over the next five years the market tripled.  
>  
>On Oct. 19, 1987, I was visiting my brother, who was spending a semester in France. When I left my hotel in Strasbourg early the next morning, I noticed the front pages on newsstands carried banner headlines reporting the Dow had dropped “23.” I wondered why the American market was front-page news in France. I looked more closely and saw the 23 preceded a percentage symbol. The Dow had dropped an unfathomable 508 points in one day. On a percentage basis, it was the stock market’s worst day ever.  
>  
>I felt a powerful urge to salvage what was left of my modest savings by selling. But I was far away and had no choice but to hold.  
>  
>Once I was back in the United States, the market seemed to stabilize. But volatility soon returned. In one of those downdrafts, I panicked and sold my entire fund.  
>  
>By September 1989, the market had recovered all its losses. I watched from the sidelines, waiting in vain for a good time to get back in.  
>  
>I vowed to never again trade in a panic. I made a rule — never sell on a down day — and a corollary: Never buy on an up day.  
>  
>That served me well over the next decade’s record bull market, fueled by the tech boom. Times were even headier than during the 1980s. I often overheard personal trainers at the gym boasting about their favorite tech stocks.  
>  
>The notion of diversification was largely unknown to me. In early 2000, when the tech bubble burst and the next crash came, I was fully invested and stayed that way. I watched as the value of my investments shriveled. I stopped looking at stock tables, which at least provided some psychological comfort. I dropped my monthly paper statements into the trash unopened.  
>  
>But at least I adhered to my 1987 principle: I did not sell.  
>  
>In the wake of the two-year bear market, I refined my strategy. I figured that if I bought every time the market average declined by 10 percent from its previous high — the standard definition of a correction — and then bought some more after each subsequent decline of 10 percent, then I’d never be buying at the top of the cycle.  
>  
>I didn’t think of this as market timing, since I made no prediction where the market was headed. My strategy was a variation of the now-widespread practice of portfolio rebalancing — selling some asset classes and buying others to maintain a steady allocation.  
>  
>I put this system into practice during the 2008 financial crisis. I recall shocked reactions that October when — with the market plunging and others boasting that they’d had the foresight to get out — I said I was buying.  
>  
>My timing was hardly perfect. The market fell by 10 percent on five occasions — so I had plenty of opportunities to add to my stock positions. The last came in March 2009. In hindsight, the first of those 10 percent declines was a foolish time to have been buying, given that the market went down another 40 percent. But I reaped the gains even on those early purchases during the record-setting bull market that ended this month. Back in 2009, I didn’t have to worry about getting back into the market. I was already there.  
>  
>What’s another virus scare?  
>  
>There have been only five 10 percent corrections since then, and each was a buying opportunity for me. None was followed by a second 10 percent decline. The last of these corrections came at the end of 2018. As cash built up in my account, I wondered when, if ever, I’d get another such opportunity. I grew impatient. On Feb. 19, the S&P 500 closed at a record high. No one seemed to see a bear market or recession on the horizon, even as stock multiples teetered at record highs and a strange virus began to spread.  
>  
>Until a week later.  
>  
>Stocks fell, slowly at first, then gaining steam. By Feb. 25 the S&P 500 had dropped 7.6 percent from its peak.  
>  
>From a financial standpoint, I wasn’t worried about the virus. Infections were leveling off in China. There were a few cases in the United States, most in a single nursing home in Washington State. Everyone was saying we had better medical care, better air quality and more effective means to prevent its spread than China. As an investor, I’d lived through many virus scares — SARS, MERS, swine flu, Ebola — and their ravages had no discernible impact on American stocks. Even the devastating AIDS epidemic had little effect on the broader economy or booming market.  
>  
>So I bought stock (a broad-based index fund) on Feb. 25, jumping the gun on my own 10 percent buying target. My pent-up eagerness and optimism overwhelmed my disciplined strategy. I didn’t make a conscious decision to violate it. I didn’t even think about it in my haste to take advantage of what I assumed would be a fleeting opportunity.  
>  
>Stocks dropped a little more the next day. Then, on Feb. 27, the S&P plunged nearly 5 percent. Now the market was officially in a correction, its fastest ever, down 12 percent from the peak the prior week. The coronavirus had spread globally, including to the United States.  
>  
> I realized I should have waited. I felt foolish and guilty for violating my rules. I vowed not to do it again.   
>  
>The biggest drop since Black Monday  
>  
>But how smart I felt the next Monday. The S&P soared nearly 5 percent, amid rumors the Federal Reserve was about to cut interest rates.  
>  
>The high was short-lived. By the end of the week, the S&P had erased Monday’s gains. By now I was worried, too, but I’m not an infectious disease expert. I figured stocks had priced in the risks. What I did know was that they were now deep into a correction, and so I bought more.  
>  
>My buying may have been premature the first time, but now I was back on track, sticking to my playbook. At a time of soaring uncertainty on so many fronts, I felt like I was taking charge of my destiny.  
>  
>That was the last time that buying stocks felt good, like I was pouncing on a fleeting opportunity. It soon became a source of profound anxiety.  
>  
>Over the first weekend in March, headlines were all about the explosive spread of the virus in Italy. Photos of deserted piazzas drove home the gravity of the situation. What had seemed a distant threat now seemed close to home."

So far, I've got peas, bunching onions, six varieties of lettuce (probably overkill, but I like salads), spinach, garlic, and radishes going outside.  The lettuce and radishes are about a month away from harvest, with the garlic, bunching onions, and peas about 2-3 months away.  I've also got tomatoes, regular onions, and a ton of peppers started indoors under grow lights, and those should be ready to go outside around the time I'm pulling the other plants.  Started some herbs as well (garlic chives, parsley, and basil).  I did a little bit of gardening last year, but I'm really ramping up this year, and I'm excited to see how everything turns out."

Unfortunately we have a clash of opinions: gun rights organizations are sensitive to most any new hindrance to purchasing firearms and ammo while people who don't own firearms or view firearms as part of their daily life see gun stores as secondary to reducing spread.  Courts favor access to bearing arms over closing gun stores in emergencies.  Perhaps a lower court will see it the other way in this case and it'll end up in the court system for the next 10 - 20 years.

What can be done to stop gun stores becoming coronavirus mega spreaders?  I would suggest changing the whole background check process so as to be more efficient and make it possible for customers to complete the process before making a trip to the gun store (over phone or online).  Someone who fails wouldn't have to make a trip someone who passes could be quickly verified (documents/ID) and spend the least amount of time inside the store.  Meanwhile forgo the 10 (BG check is usually done within minutes, even in CA) day wait period so as not to have customers visit twice then limit the number of customers allowed per sq ft. floor space."

We could have been prepared for this, we could have diverted corporations to produce ventilators and masks and gloves on mass for months/weeks in advance to prepare for this upcoming shitshow.

Now doctors and nurses will have to take the burden and stress and real life dangers of being infected themselves and infecting their loved ones at home while being asked to work tripple shifts and decide which patients are more likely to survive with the working ventilator and which patients who are too risky to even attempt to save because of lack of resources and staff and space.

**Its really fucking frustrating to me that people dont take this shit more seriously.** 

This is a world-wide changing event. The amount of real life damage that is going to happen simply because we are SEVERELY under-prepared for such a virulent and tough virus. 40 years ago scientists warned us about this, 20 years ago scientists warned us about this, 10 years ago after the H1N1 pandemic they warned us of stronger and harder to cure viruses. We scoffed and decided it was smarter to listen to politicians than scientists and experts.

I mean this should be a fucking wake up call for all of us but since were still at the essentially start of the pandemic, and most people still just dont fucking understand. A lot of people still think its overrated and overblown, and that this is just another sars pandemic, that its just the flu and nothing bad will happen. 

This isnt a runny nose and some sneezing thing, if you catch the worst of it, you feel like you're choking for air while simultaneously aching all over your body, dehydration, confusion, headaches. This is some serious shit, and im not just talking about the severity of the illness , but EVEN MORE IMPORTANT the logistical, transport, availability of medical supplies and medical workers and real issues of lack of space for those that WILL require emergency care for longer periods. (some states are already issuing calls for helps because of overburdened ICU units, and were just at the start of this pandemic)

[If we compare it to the H1N1 pandemic of 2009/2010](https://imgur.com/16CgevX); In the U.S., the CDC estimates there were 60.8 million cases of swine flu, with over 274,000 hospitalizations and nearly 12,500 deaths — that's a **mortality rate of about 0.02%.**

The Covid-19 Virus has been estimated to have a **mortality rate of 2-5%.** (based on tested cases so far, likely closer to half once full tests are done as a lot of people are asymptomatic/untested) 

***If the swine flu had Covid-19s mortality rate, then there would have been more than 1,200,000 - 3,000,000 deaths in the US alone.*** 

For the 2009 H1N1 virus, the mean **R-nought value was 1.46**, (regular flu is around 1.35) according to a review published in the journal BMC Infectious Diseases. For the novel coronavirus, the **R-nought value is estimated to be between 2.8-3.2**, at the moment. (European CDC)

**To specify, this is a VERY virulent virus. In simple terms, In a normal flu, you have a infection rate of 1.35. Meaning you infect that many people they infect that many people and so on, if you do so for 10 steps, you end up with around under 30 people infected. The Covid 19 virus on the other hand, it has a infection rate of 2.8-3.2. Which means by 10 steps you would have upwards of 200,000 infected**.

[Source.](https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/sites/default/files/documents/RRA-seventh-update-Outbreak-of-coronavirus-disease-COVID-19.pdf)

> Recent modelling of the basic reproductive number (R0) from Italy estimate
R0 between 2.76 and 3.25. Researchers from Lombardy who analysed the early phase of the outbreak in their
region reported a reduction in R0 shortly after the introduction of mitigation measures [23]. This is consistent with 
findings from China. A recent review of 12 modelling studies reports the mean R0 at 3.28, with a median of 2.79.
R0 is proportional to the contact rate and will vary according to the local situation. Further research is needed to
get a more accurate estimate of R0 in the various outbreak settings [23]

If the Rnaugth (R0) is indeed 3 or above, then we are really fucked.


To further emphasize on the seriousness of this virus; 

* the virus can remain airborne for upto 4 hours. It can survive on cardboard and other surfaces for upto 72 hours. 

*  there are some reports of re-infection from china & japan and other cases. Unlike the flu where it takes several years to get re-infected, there are some reports of patients having recovered but still carry the virus.

* just recently in the last 24 hours, they have found in iceland that over half of active Covid-19 carriers, have no symptoms at all but are still spreading the virus to their surroundings.

But the biggest strain will be to the hospitals and medial supplies and medical staff; 

* Currently the US has only [924,107 staffed hospital beds](https://www.aha.org/statistics/fast-facts-us-hospitals) TOTAL.

* and statistics show already the hospitals have a **[occupancy rate of 65%.](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/hus/2017/089.pdf)** 

 Meaning that out of the 1M hospital beds, on average, 600,669 Hospital beds will already be in use by other patients for other illnesses and issues. Which leaves only 924,107 - 600,669 = **323,437 available hospital beds.**

While scientists and experts project a potential up to 70% of the global population to become infected [source](https://www.businessinsider.com/coronavirus-150-million-americans-may-get-infected-2020-3), and where around 20%-30% (based on data by CDC and EuropeanCDC) of the infected WILL require hospitalization. [Source](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/69/wr/mm6912e2.htm?s_cid=mm6912e2_e&deliveryName=USCDC_921-DM23064)

Heck **IF EVEN ZERO POINT ONE %** of USA require intensive care in the US at the same 2 week period, thats going to be almost 330,000 people needing hospital beds where there are only 300,000 available (with only max 100K intensive care beds).

**Asymptomatic Cases**: Asymptomatic infections have also been taken into consideration but their frequency is unknown. So far there are three reports of tests finding 30-50% asymptomatic results out of tests. But again this is a fairly new virus, H1N1 lasted 18 months, and had a incubation period of 1-4 days while Covid-19 has only been around 2 months and has a incubation period of 1-14 days. 

> CDC officials have said that while it's clear asymptomatic spread does happen, it does not appear to be the driver of the outbreak -- or as the CDC says on its website, asymptomatic transmission ""is not thought to be the main way the virus spreads.""

AND to make matters worse, this is all disregarding the amount of hospital workers/suppliers/producers doctors, nurses, emergency respondents, equipment, Ventilators, transportation, organ transplants, blood availability, who will also be affected by Covid-19.

If this pandemic continues to be disregarded as it is, it will lead to the amount of people infected at the same time growing far beyond the capacity and resources available.

**That is why its important that everyone stay inside so that this virus can go through the world gradually and hopefully minimize the infection rates and eventually be vaccinated against and die off.**"

I went ahead and self quarantined for 2 weeks, juuuuust in case, though I stopped showing symptoms after a hellish 1.5 weeks. 

For a while I figured I had just overreacted and had the flu, but then a guy in my city died from coronavirus and when the news said when and where he likely picked it up, it was the exact place I had been at the exact time I had been there. Made me really happy I had holed up in my house and didn't go anywhere to share the wealth.

Not long after that the everything shut down so I had more reason to stay at home; so besides a grocery store run at the end of the 2 weeks (and about 4 days after my last symptom had vanished), I've been hiding inside my house since. 

Just in case it was only the flu and I might get sick again lol"

Watching this relatively young guy, gasping for air, pink frothy secretions coming out of his tube and out of his mouth. The ventilator should have been doing the work of breathing but he was still gasping for air, moving his mouth, moving his body, struggling. We had to restrain him. With all the coronavirus patients, we’ve had to restrain them. They really hyperventilate, really struggle to breathe. When you’re in that mindstate of struggling to breathe and delirious with fever, you don’t know when someone is trying to help you, so you’ll try to rip the breathing tube out because you feel it is choking you, but you are drowning."

Presidential approval rises during a crisis, but it doesn't stay that way if the crisis keeps going on and on. Carter got a bump at the start of the Iran Hostage Crisis, and in the end that's one of the things that cost him re-election.

And this isn't really like 9/11 where there's a clear ""other"", where the President and people can be like ""they did this to us!"". Sure, if coronavirus itself was on the ballot people wouldn't vote for it, but otherwise part of the reason it's so bad is the person running for re-election.

If I were a GOP strategist I'd be pretty worried - Carter's rally the flag high water mark at the start of the Iran Hostage Crisis was like 60%. Here, it's not clear Trump will break much past 45%."

China and other parts of asia may seem rosy right now, but one need only look at Italy and Spain to see how serious it is. The current stock market recovery is in my opinion what is lovingly referred to as a dead cat bounce we have in no means recovered. The fundamentals of the economy do not have to follow the movements of the stock market. As for China well they recently closed all cinemas again and are blocking foreigners again so it may seem less in control than previously thought. Again only time will tell, it’s alright to be skeptical of people’s political agendas regarding the coronavirus, but real lives have been lost and real lives are affected and that should be taken seriously. Also “drop like flys” doesn’t sound great, your thinking is pretty malthusian. It’s true the flu takes a lot of people’s lives each year, but the mortality rate of coronavirus makes it much more deadly than the flu. The other issue is some of the deaths that are preventable aren’t being prevented because of lack of resources and definitive action. I agree the media is causing panic, but we shouldn’t downplay tragedy."

How is it still up in the air? We are getting checks.

""A big question among individuals who are living on Social Security or other government benefits is whether they will be eligible for a relief check.

The answer is **yes**, regardless of whether they are on Social Security, Supplemental Security Income, or SSI, or veterans benefits.

**“They are eligible**,” said Michael Zona, a spokesman for Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, chairman of the Senate Finance Committee that put together the legislation.

“There aren’t provisions explaining a list of people eligible — it’s a broad definition, meant to be as all-encompassing as possible,” Zona said.""

The only thing up in the air, is if SSI recipients will hae to file taxes to receive the money. 

&#x200B;

“A possibility is for the \[approximately\] 4 million individuals affected by this quirk to file zero-liability tax returns,” said Webster Phillips, senior policy analyst at the National Committee to Preserve Social Security and Medicare.

“But no one knows for now how this will be handled,” Phillips said.

SSI benefits are provided to older, blind or disabled individuals who have little or no income. 

“They’re the very poorest among us,” said Nancy Altman, president of Social Security Works.

While the government already has their addresses and sends them monthly payments, they may still have to file a tax return just to get their stimulus money, she said.

Plus, all payments will be disbursed by the Treasury Department and not the Social Security Administration,  which is a complication, she said.""

Again, we will get the $$, just not sure yet how to handle those on SSI."

As is the number of deaths from Covid-19. Researchers worldwide are feverishly searching for a vaccine.

One of them, who is unable to find it fast enough, is the Basel immunologist Peter Burkhard. He develops a vaccine in his own laboratory in Riehen and tests it on himself. On SRF you can see him injecting 20 micrograms of the vaccine into his leg - even before animal experiments or toxicological tests are completed. According to the SRF report, Burkhard could at best prove in four weeks that the vaccine also produces antibodies in humans.

&#x200B;

Weighing up the risks

&#x200B;

The researcher also comments on the risk he is taking: ""What is the risk if I inject the vaccine? And what if I don't do it and am exposed to the virus instead?"" he asks rhetorically. The new coronavirus has a death rate in Italy of around ten percent.

&#x200B;

""There must be a vaccine as soon as possible. The longer it takes, the more people die,"" Burkhard continues. ""If it worked, it would be indescribable."" It's a race against the virus, not against the other vaccine developers.

In 2008/2009 there was a real argument that bailing out the banks was rewarding bad behavior. The banks bundled valueless assets and lied about them being very valuable.  That set a time bomb in the economy that was going to explode the minute housing prices stopped rocketing skyward.  Leaving aside the question of whether it was necessary to bail out the banks in 08/09 to save the economy, bailing them out rewarded their bad behavior. 

The Coronavirus situation is different. This is not a problem that the corporations caused.  This is like a meteor striking the earth and blaming the dinosaurs.  

Like it or not helping large corporations in this specific situation is necessary. The government needs to get as much cash out the door and into the economy as fast as possible.

March 20, 2020

With COVID-19 infections documented in every US state and clinicians waking up to the fact that this is everywhere, there is still lack of clarity on many basic points about the management of infection.
Although most people can be expected to recover at home without complications, patients with asthma are among those at risk for serious illness, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).
And people with asthma ""have concerns about the steroids in their asthma inhalers weakening their immune system,"" notes the Asthma and Allergy Foundation of America (AAFA) website.
But asthma specialists are stressing that patients must keep using their preventive inhalers during this pandemic.

Optimal Control of Asthma Is First Defense Against Infection

""People with asthma need their [preventive] steroids,"" said Mitchell Grayson, MD, an allergist–immunologist at Nationwide Children's Hospital and chair of the medical scientific council for the AAFA. 

Michael Blaiss, MD, executive medical director of the American College of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (ACAAI), echoed that advice.

""If a patient has asthma they need to stay on their preventive asthma medication, which in most cases would include inhaled corticosteroids,"" Blaiss, who is also clinical professor of pediatrics at the Medical College of Georgia in Augusta, told Medscape Medical News.
Optimally controlled asthma is the first weapon in the fight against the infection, other experts concurred.
""The last thing we want is patients stopping their asthma medicine and getting acutely ill,"" David Hill, MD, a pulmonary and critical care specialist in Waterbury, Connecticut, told Medscape Medical News.
""We don't want people coming to the hospital because they stopped adhering to their therapy out of fear that the therapy was going to cause a problem.""

""If you have asthma and you are sick and you're bronchospastic and wheezing that's a reason to use steroids,"" stressed Hill, who is a spokesperson for the American Lung Association.

Concerns That Corticosteroids Worsen COVID-19

Part of the confusion is arising from reports of concerns about corticosteroid treatment in patients in general with lung involvement because of COVID-19 infection.

Advice for those in the general population infected with COVID-19 is that ""corticosteroids are to be avoided"" during treatment, according to the CDC as well as the World Health Organization.

This current consensus that there is no reason ""to expect that patients [in general] with COVID-19 infection will benefit from corticosteroids, and they might be more likely to be harmed with such treatment,"" is also detailed in a Lancet commentary published last month.

This is because corticosteroids may ""inhibit immune responses and pathogen clearance"" of COVID-19, say the commentary authors, led by Clark D. Russell, MBChB, of the Centre for Inflammation Research, University of Edinburgh, UK.

And one of China's coronavirus experts has identified prolonged, high-dose corticosteroid use as a major risk factor for COVID-19 death.

""We conclude that corticosteroid treatment should not be used for the treatment of COVID-19–induced lung injury or shock outside of a clinical trial,"" say Russell and colleagues.

No Evidence That Staying on Steroids Worsens COVID-19 in Asthma

With regular influenza, not maintaining good symptom control is much more likely to result in patients with asthma being hospitalized, going to the ICU, and dying.

And there's currently no evidence to suggest the advice should be any different for COVID-19, say experts.

""The most important thing for an individual with asthma to avoid the complications of any viral respiratory infection, including COVID-19, is to maintain good control of their asthma,"" emphasized James Sublett, MD, past president of the ACAAI, and cofounder and chief medical officer of Family Allergy & Asthma, based in Louisville, Kentucky.

""We don't have any data that patients who stay on their preventive medication have more severe problems, more hospitalizations [with COVID-19],"" said Blaiss.

Eric Macy, MD, an allergist–immunologist at Kaiser Permanente in San Diego, California, and a fellow of the American Academy of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology, agrees: ""There are no data at this time that I am aware of that support an alternative plan.""

Blaiss said that only the most severe asthma patients will be on oral corticosteroids anyway, ""and with the advent of biologics, the vast majority switched.""

""However, if patients are on oral corticosteroids with severe asthma [and COVID-19], they may want to check with their pulmonologist, but I would think the risk of not controlling the asthma is much more dangerous than being on the medication.""

Pulmonologists in France, too, strongly emphasize that patients with asthma must continue treatment in the face of COVID-19. Those who are receiving inhaled or oral corticosteroid therapy should not interrupt it without the advice of their pulmonologist, or their attending physician, at the risk of exacerbating their illness, stress the French pulmonology society, Société de Pneumologie de Langue Française (SPLF), in a report today by Medscape France.

Pulmonologist Colas Tcherakian, MD, PhD, of Foch Hospital, Suresnes, France, said in a separate interview with Medscape France that, paradoxically, asthma does not always appear to be a significant risk factor for COVID-19, at least based on the experience so far in France — this may be due to the fact that background treatment is protective, he hypothesized.

So the answer as to whether to stop steroid treatment if you have asthma and are infected with COVID-19 is clearly ""no"", Tcherakian emphasized.

Not Everyone With COVID-19 Presents With Fever  

Allergist–immunologist Grayson also noted one particularly concerning observation in updated CDC guidance about presenting signs and symptoms of COVID-19 is that not all patients are febrile.

With the start of allergy season, this makes identification of COVID-19 especially challenging.

""What's scaring me is that only 44% are presenting to the hospital with fever. Cough, congestion, and rhinorrhea could be allergies — or it could also be COVID-19. I have no idea, and now they're standing in front of my nurses coughing in their faces — great,"" he told Medscape Medical News. 

""We were just discussing that in our office,"" agreed Hill. ""Essentially, our message to patients is if you're not feeling well stay home. Normally when somebody's sick we want to see them but now we don't, so we're looking at telehealth options. And if they're really sick, the hospital has a special central area."""

* Countries are not reporting accurate data.  Agreed.  Both China and the US have vastly under-reported there numbers due to their total inability and unwillingness to test everyone who needs to be tested.  A good multiplier for true case counts, in both the US and China, is a range of 10 to 35.  In other words, take the US's official numbers today (or any day), and multiply it by 35, to get an estimate of what reality is.

* This is not the flu.  You don't weld people into their apartments and lock down 25% of the population of the earth for a flu.  

* The mainstream media, for several weeks, did nothing but downplay it.  This is how we got into this situation:  politics, the media, and people who blindly follow them, refused to research and investigate it for themselves, and instead just believed whatever idiotic talking head on their favorite radio show or TV show said about it.  Well, there's that and the fact that our US leader even called it a ""hoax"" himself at one point - that didn't help much.

* Governments will need to do a lot more than ask people to stay home on the honor system.  We have businesses left up to their own devices, to decide for example that selling new cars is an ""essential service"" that must continue during a lockdown.  

* No comments about Trump; the attempt that we've seen everywhere on reddit to turn every COVID-19 discussion into a political shout-down is a waste of time and is nothing more than an attempt to distract the public from the very real global health emergency at hand.

* Hospitals working at 90 to 95% capacity is their normal situation, in many hospitals.  Hospitals and governments have totally failed to adequately prepare for this pandemic and people will die as a result.  Hospitals in Italy have had to triage patients, deciding who lives and who dies, because there isn't enough equipment to go around.  New York will be doing the same soon, if they haven't already.  So will New Orleans, Detroit, and Chicago.

* I agree the lockdown is going to do an unfathomable amount of damage to our economy.  Millions of jobs destroyed.  A new Great Depression.  I think that once we get into early April, we'll have enough credible, reliable data from US cases to make a decision about whether we must end the shutdowns or not.

I also think mandatory P/F was the better choice, but completely disagree with this description of how Michigan has handled the situation. I thought Dean West's email was thoughtful, and there are plenty of valid arguments to be made for optional P/F. People got heated on both sides of the argument on lawopen, which was a bad look for everyone.

On a personal note, my dad is currently recovering from Coronavirus (he should end up being fine, thankfully!). If the situation got worse (an outcome I had been preparing for), I would have had to explain P/Fs to an employer (I might still have to, for that matter), and Dean West's explanation of how employers are viewing this made me feel better about potentially having to do so. I know this situation is a lot worse for a lot of other students and think grades should be everyone's last priority, which is why I disagree with Michigan's decision -- but I'm not prepared to say they made it in bad faith.

In any given semester, people have all kinds of personal issues, and might elect to take a P/F that they will have to explain to an employer; this is the one semester where the need for a P/F speaks for itself should an employer ask. Maybe the bigger issue is the existing law school framework/use of curved grading at all.

If he's out and about in his uniform (getting lunch or whatever) he'll almost inevitably be stopped by someone who wants to say thanks. It's a small town, so someone might say ""You probably don't remember me, but three years ago you were the paramedic who turned up when my kid fell off their bike"" or a more general ""You work at the downtown station? I want to thank you guys for saving my aunt"" or whatever.

I was visiting him once and this big burly biker dude (who, turns out, is actually a priest) came up to me and said ""You're his brother? \[crushes my hand in a handshake\] I want to let you know he saved my life."" My brother had performed CPR on him for some ridiculous amount of time until they could get him to a hospital. They're friends now.

All of that is what happened before this Coronavirus.

I guess people have mixed views on the police (""why are you writing me a traffic ticket when there are real criminals running around?"" kinda thing), and many people go their whole lives without interacting with the fire department, but pretty much everyone knows someone who has been helped out by a paramedic."

https://www.mghf.ca/mgh1000masks

Wearing a mask is sensible for the protection of health care workers and for the protection of the public. 

The strong narrative against masks has been pushed by the need to save N95s for health care workers. But wearing a simple mask is common sense in a pandemic with asymptomatic transmission. If you believe that coughing and sneezing into your elbow is helpful, then you believe a mask is helpful too.

The mask is there to contain your spit, not to filter viruses. All social distancing and hand washing routines must be kept up. ""Two metres distance determines our existence.""

After SARS, The University of Cambridge did a study of home made masks. 

https://www.researchgate.net/publication/258525804_Testing_the_Efficacy_of_Homemade_Masks_Would_They_Protect_in_an_Influenza_Pandemic

""The researchers asked volunteers to make their own masks using cotton t-shirts and a sewing machine, using a simple protocol they’d devised. Next, they performed a fit test to test how well they could capture particles down to 0.02 microns. They compared the DIY masks against surgical masks.

The homemade cotton masks captured 50% of 0.02-1 micron particles, compared with 80% for the surgical mask. Although the surgical masks captured 30% more particles, the cotton masks did surprisingly well. The researchers concluded that homemade masks would be better than nothing.""

She spent a ton of money just getting the nomination and by Labor Day only 1/3 of the district had even heard of her. Kennedy has been the only Democrat in the race since September, so she’s gotten all the district Democratic clubs on board very early, many Labor groups are supporting her, she’s endorsed by End Citizens United, Planned Parenthood Action Fund, Blue Dog PAC, Serve America PAC, the list goes on. 

The district is way more purple than people realize, just because they see the 2018 result and don’t know how botched it really was. 

Also McClintock has never lived in the district, was the only CA Congressperson to vote against the coronavirus relief bill, and hasn’t held a town hall in over 800 days.

I was home with my sister and mum. Sometimes me and my sister slept in our parent's room because my dad would work overnight hours and my mum really hated sleeping in her room alone. Never understory why but, there was always a very uneasy atmosphere in their room. 

The house was built back in the late 1800s so the build was a little weird. My parent's room had a storage closet right at the end of their bed, but it was built like 4ft off the ground up the wall, it was bizzare. Nothing was inside, just a small brick room. I always hated the closet, it scared me every time I was in there at night. 

My sister never noticed the sounds coming from the closet, my mum said she never heard anything either. I'd hear scratching and tiny knocking sounds and the occasional voice of a woman coming from th closet. Good God did it freeze me in fear. Again, nobody but me noticed. 

We moved out in 2004 into a new house not far away from our previous house. Around 2011-2012 when I was home alone I heard the voice again, out of nowhere. Very clear and very loud, it said ""I'm here! Hello! I'm here! I'm here!"" And I just froze again.. if anyone has seen Bambi, when he thinks he hears his mother calling for him after her death, that is exactly what it sounded like. Bizzare.

My sister started making comments about feeling uneasy at night and hearing something scratching the carpet and small knocks on the walls. Sometimes she would sleep with me because it freaked her out so much. 


I never told her that I would see a shadow around her bed sometimes when I walked past, just standing above it. Her room is now my room (I'm staying with them whilst the Coronavirus dies down) and I don't experience it anymore. Though, I did have a music box that would play on itself whenever I left the room and shut the door. It would happen when we had company, whenever really. Sorry, very long lol."

Instead of it being paid it in 2021 when you file your taxes they are advancing it this year. They are using 2019 filings (or 2018 if your have not filed your 2019 taxes yet) to determine the amount of the credit). If the amount advanced is greater than what you should have received you will not be required to pay it back. If the amount credited is less than what you should have received you will be able to claim the rest on your 2020 tax return. 

These are not deductions intended to lower your taxable income. These are tax credits meaning the government owes you money. When you get money back on you taxes you are in fact receiving a tax credit. If you owe taxes you have a tax debit. These Coronavirus Credit is just a free credit up to $1200/$2400 for 2020. You will not have to pay taxes on it and it will not affect the amount of taxes you owe or are returned to you.

Definitely one of the least visited. I used to backcountry ski there regularly and would go all day without seeing anyone. One of those places where it's a relief to see someone. But on 3 day weekends the place gets a lot of Bay Area traffic. I can imagine people are treating the area like a Coronavirus escape. Could easily agitate the park service working in the visitors center and nearby small communities.

2020-03-27,MaeveyMillavey,blogsnark,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/blogsnark/comments/fpvi2z/coronavirus_megathread_march_27/flpdl9y/,"I’m newly pregnant (almost 8 wks along) and found out right before things started ramping up in the US. Of course we started trying before that, and didn’t really know things were going to escalate the way they did when I went off my birth control. The timing feels challenging for many reasons, but I am grateful overall and excited. I’m in my late thirties and felt like the timing was right (outside of Coronavirus stuff) and that we might not have another opportunity if we waited.

It’s hard not knowing what things will be like later on around the time when I am due. I feel heartbroken thinking about women giving birth alone in the hospital.

They also don’t know very much about the impact of getting the virus while pregnant, especially in early pregnancy, so I am being extra cautious. I haven’t left my house for 2 weeks except to go on walks (thankfully I am able to work from home)."
