Last week the US stock market fell by 6 trillion dollars due to coronavirus concerns. It was pretty big news, and a couple notable industries took a significant hit (airlines), but nothing collapsed, the stock market kept ticking along, and everything is essentially fine. 

The entire balance of student debt in the US is 1.5 trillion. That means 4x the entire amount of student debt in the US was wiped out of the stock market in five days last week, it had no significant effect on just about anyone, and we have nothing to show for it. 

If just 25% of those losses went to forgiving student debt instead of skittish sell offs, the housing market would erupt overnight, millennial pregnancies would skyrocket, new businesses would multiply, and we‚Äôd probably boost gdp growth by an entire % for multiple years."

KIRKLAND, Wash. ‚Äî The hardest day of Debbie de los Angeles‚Äôs life had been the day she put her mother into a nursing home. That was before coronavirus.


As fatal infections spread through the Life Care Center in suburban Seattle, where her 85-year-old mother lived, Ms. de los Angeles had tried not to worry. Nurses were monitoring her mother‚Äôs temperature. They reassured Ms. de los Angeles that her mother had no fever, cough or other signs of infection.


But at 4:15 a.m. on Tuesday, a nurse called with troubling news. Her mother, Twilla Morin, had developed a 104-degree fever. They were giving her Tylenol. Then the nurse confirmed her do-not-resuscitate orders.


‚ÄúWe anticipate that she, too, has the coronavirus,‚Äù a voicemail message from a nurse said. ‚ÄúWe do not anticipate her fighting this.‚Äù


Moving into a nursing home can be a wrenching choice for aging parents and their adult children. But families said they never imagined facing a public health crisis in the quiet hallways where they once believed their loved ones would be safe.


In the week since the Kirkland nursing facility became the focal point of an unfolding coronavirus outbreak in the Pacific Northwest, daily life has stalled into a sleepless, slow-motion agony. With visits restricted, families now call and call for updates from the overworked nursing staff. The families wonder whether they should demand a visit, risking their own health and wider contamination. Some want their parents moved to the hospital or to a different facility but have no idea who else would care for fragile patients potentially exposed to a deadly disease.



‚ÄúI just feel ill that my mom could be dying alone,‚Äù said Vanessa Phelps, whose 90-year-old mother has chronic breathing problems and has lived at the facility for four years. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs pure panic and I can do nothing. I have no control.‚Äù


Some families now call twice a day to ask how their octogenarian parents are feeling and reassure them about the alarming television news transmitted into their rooms, much of it featuring the crisis right there inside the center. Some video chat on tablet computers designed for older users. One woman stood outside her mother‚Äôs window to catch a glimpse between the slats.


It has been like seeing a ship sink without lifeboats. ‚ÄúWe are watching from the shore and not being able to do anything,‚Äù said Alex Stewart, whose 95-year-old grandmother lives in the nursing center and has been crocheting a small blanket in anticipation of Ms. Stewart‚Äôs baby ‚Äî her first great-grandchild. ‚ÄúIt is a very helpless feeling.‚Äù


Nobody knows for sure how the coronavirus first entered the facility, which has become a grim warning of how the virus can spread particularly quickly inside nursing homes. At least eight of the 14 coronavirus deaths in the United States have been Life Care residents, and at least a half dozen other people connected to the facility have been sickened by the virus.



Even amid intense scrutiny of the nursing center and its record of handling infections, families said they were struggling to get basic information from Life Care‚Äôs leaders and public health officials. They said they had spent untold hours on the phone, being shunted between county and state government offices and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.



One man said he called a federal hotline and introduced himself as the son of an octogenarian Life Care resident. The response, he said, was concerning: He was asked whether there had been any coronavirus cases in his area.


Many residents inside the 190-bed facility went days without being tested for coronavirus, families said, even as they and their roommates started coughing and feeling feverish. Families worry that the true number of infections may be higher than official totals.


Experts in infectious diseases say older people, many of whom have underlying health problems and respiratory problems, are particularly vulnerable to the virus and have a higher risk of death.

‚ÄúPeople keep saying, ‚ÄòWhy don‚Äôt you just go and bust them out?‚Äô‚Äù said Kevin Connolly, whose 81-year-old father-in-law, Jerry Wall, has been at the home for about a year recovering from heart failure.


‚ÄúIt‚Äôs his home,‚Äù Mr. Connolly said. ‚ÄúHe likes the food, he likes the care, he has friends there.‚Äù


At a news conference on Wednesday, Dr. Jeff Duchin, the officer for public health in Seattle and King County, said teams were now working to test every Life Care resident for the virus, and apologized for a breakdown in communication. A federal disaster medical assistance team was expected to arrive at the center on Thursday.

Ellie Basham, the executive director of Life Care, said in a statement that it was assigning every resident a representative who could answer questions from family members.


Continue reading the main story
Families welcomed the promised help, and praised the nurses and caregivers who showed up to work even as the virus spread and as several employees tested positive. It appeared that the virus tests were underway on Thursday; one relative reported that her father had been swabbed.


On Wednesday night, Ms. Stewart said her grandmother had begun to feel chills and short of breath.


‚ÄúShe rang for the nurse, but they hadn‚Äôt come yet,‚Äù Ms. Stewart said. By Thursday, her grandmother was feeling better. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre hoping it was just a blip and not the virus,‚Äù Ms. Stewart said. ‚ÄúBut we don‚Äôt know yet until she‚Äôs tested.‚Äù


Day by day, desperation has grown for families of sicker, weaker residents.


Bridget Parkhill‚Äôs 77-year-old mother had been ill for nearly a week inside the home. On Wednesday, she was taken to the hospital after her coughing worsened and she felt a heaviness in her chest. ‚ÄúWe are devastated that it‚Äôs come to this,‚Äù Ms. Parkhill said. Her mother returned to the home on Thursday.
Ms. de los Angeles, 65, said that her mother, Ms. Morin, had never wanted to move into a nursing home.

Ms. Morin had been a numbers whiz, once halting an embezzlement scheme while working as a bookkeeper. She had also learned to day trade stocks and would get up early for the market open on Wall Street, three time zones ahead of her home in Kennewick, in southeastern Washington State.

Ms. Morin moved into her first nursing home about four years ago after she could no longer stand or walk by herself. As her dementia deepened, Ms. Morin sometimes confused Ms. de los Angeles, her only child, for her sister.

Her world at the Life Care Center, where she had lived for two years, had narrowed to her shared room, the wheelchair she rolled to the dining room and the table where she often ate by herself. She loved a cup of hot chocolate at night and cared for a doll as if it were a real child. In lucid moments, she knew she was proud of her grandsons, Ms. de los Angeles said.



Ms. de los Angeles wanted to race to the nursing facility this week when she heard that her mother‚Äôs condition was deteriorating. But she knew the risks of infecting her husband, who has lung problems, were too great.


She got regular updates from the nurses caring for her mother, and was comforted that mother‚Äôs favorite nurse was on duty, and that her mother appeared to be mostly sleeping. And yet.
‚ÄúWe wanted to be there,‚Äù Ms. de los Angeles said. ‚ÄúShe was alone.‚Äù


Early on Wednesday morning, Ms. de los Angeles woke to a new voicemail message from Life Care. Her mother had died at 2:10 a.m., the message said. Because of the ‚Äúunique situation‚Äù at the home, her mother‚Äôs remains had to be picked up by the coroner, a nurse said.


By late morning, Ms. de los Angeles and her husband, Bob, were sitting on living-room couches at their home in Monroe, Wash., surrounded by their four grown sons, looking at old photos and sharing memories of Ms. Morin.


They had to arrange her cremation and decide whether it was safe to pick up her ring, stuffed teddy bear and other belongings. They were waiting for test results to determine whether Ms. Morin had contracted the coronavirus. It had been a month since the family‚Äôs last visit, so they were not worried about being infected themselves. Ms. de los Angeles said she simply needed to know.

‚ÄúI still question what‚Äôs going on in that nursing home,‚Äù Ms. de los Angeles said. ‚ÄúThey gown up. They wear masks. But the virus is still making its way around"

**Statement by a quarantined nurse from a northern California Kaiser facility**

*March 5, 2020*

As a nurse, I‚Äôm very concerned that not enough is being done to stop the spread of the coronavirus. I know because I am currently sick and in quarantine after caring for a patient who tested positive. I‚Äôm awaiting ‚Äúpermission‚Äù from the federal government to allow for my testing, even after my physician and county health professional ordered it.

I volunteered to be on the care team for this patient, who we knew was positive. I did this because I had all the recommended protective gear and training from my employer. I did this assuming that if something happened to me, of course I too would be cared for. Then, what was a small concern after a few days of caring for this patient, became my reality:
I started getting sick.

When employee health told me that my fever and other symptoms fit the criteria for potential coronavirus, I was put on a 14-day self-quarantine. Since the criteria was met, the testing would be done. My doctor ordered the test through the county.

The public county officer called me and verified my symptoms and agreed with testing. But the National CDC would not initiate testing. They said they would not test me because if I were wearing the recommended protective equipment, then I wouldn‚Äôt have the coronavirus.

What kind of science-based answer is that? What a ridiculous and uneducated response from the department that is in charge of our health in this country.

Later, they called back, and now it‚Äôs an issue with something called the ‚Äúidentifier number.‚Äù They claim they prioritize running samples by illness severity and that there are only so many to give out each day. So I have to wait in line to find out the results.

This is not the ticket dispenser at the deli counter; it‚Äôs a public health emergency! I am a registered nurse, and I need to know if I am positive before going back to caring for patients.

I am appalled at the level of bureaucracy that‚Äôs preventing nurses from getting tested. That is a health care decision my doctor and my county health department agree with. Delaying this test puts the whole community at risk.

I have the backing of my union. Nurses aren‚Äôt going to stand by and let this testing delay continue; we are going to stand together to make sure we can protect our patients‚Äîby being protected ourselves."

\> COVID-19 Vaccine and ant-viral Makers will get a big junk of the  8.3 billion dollar beervirus bill that went through congress on  March 4 2020. Expect to hear something from the president as early as Thursday but no later then sunday. Trump likes wins and giving these 4 top companies money can provide a vaccine quickly to keep America Great!. These companies may get as much as 2 billion between them. ($INO, $GILD, $MRNA)

\> two days ago I predicted 25-50 basis point cut and it was actually 50 basis points. This will do nothing. The market will continue to plunge despite the fake rise in indices today. The market will correct itself.

\> I expect some action from the ""Plunge Protection Team"" when the market drops 30% from the recent peak. I expect this to happen sometime in the next 3 weeks. At that time they may stop all trading. Check what happened in 2008. It will repeat.

Washington State‚Äôs death toll from the coronavirus reached 13 on Thursday, driven by an outbreak at a nursing home in the Seattle suburbs, and the state‚Äôs overall number of infections rose to 75.

Eleven of the deaths have come at EvergreenHealth Medical Center in Kirkland, near where the nursing home is located. The state has had one other person die at a different hospital and another die at home.

On Thursday, Vice President Mike Pence visited the state and met with Gov. Jay Inslee. At a news conference, the two skipped sharing a handshake and instead bumped elbows ‚Äî a greeting growing in popularity in the region as people try to keep their hands clean and avoid viral spread.

‚ÄúWashington State is on the front lines of the coronavirus,‚Äù Mr. Pence said. Mr. Inslee, a Democrat, praised Mr. Pence for his work assisting the state, while Mr. Pence said the full resources of the federal government would be brought to help combat the coronavirus.

As government leaders in the region have taken escalating action to contain the crisis, public spaces in the region have emptied out. Seattle‚Äôs notorious traffic all but vanished, and the few cars on the highways raced along unimpeded.

In the South Lake Union area, where thousands of people work for tech companies and parking is usually a challenge, spaces were easy to find. One ride-share driver reported that her income has dropped by half since a week ago.Amazon and Microsoft, which both call the region home, have encouraged employees to work from home.

A new research paper says the new coronavirus has two distinct strains ‚Äî and it's possible to be infected with both at the same time.

The study, which looked at 103 genomes of SARS-CoV-2, found the virus had evolved into two separate strains, known as ""S"" and ""L"".

The ""S"" type is older and seems to be milder, while the newer, more prevalent ""L"" type is more aggressive.

Viruses are known for constantly mutating ‚Äî in fact, these mutations are so rapid that scientists can use them to trace where in the world patients might have picked up the virus ‚Äî but these two types are so distinct they are classed into two strains.

Not only do these two strains exist, but it's possible to be infected with both at the same time. A male patient on the Gold Coast here in Australia ""might have been infected by at least two different strains"", the authors of the research paper wrote."

2020-03-05,One_Curious_Jay,Coronavirus,22,https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/fe2miv/the_coronavirus_by_the_numbers_a_mathematician/fjldmrl/,"Adam  Kucharski studies how diseases spread, but he‚Äôs not handling viruses in  the lab or treating sick people in the hospital. He‚Äôs a mathematician at the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine, and he uses  math to understand outbreaks of diseases like Ebola, SARS, influenza and  now Covid-19. His goal is to design better ways to control outbreaks.

In  a recent experiment for the 100th anniversary of the 1918 flu, he  worked with another mathematician and BBC presenter, Hannah Fry, of  University College London, to create a documentary, ‚ÄúContagion: The BBC  Four Pandemic,‚Äù using a phone app to track social contacts and map how  an infection might spread.

The news of  coronavirus epidemics around the world involves a flood of numbers that  are a challenge for any nonscientist to digest. I asked Dr. Kucharski  to help us navigate some of these numbers, and to tell us which ones we  should pay attention to. We talked on the phone and corresponded by  email this week. This is an edited version of our back and forth.

**We hear a lot about the percentage of sick people who are dying. Is that the case fatality rate?**

The case fatality rate measures the risk that someone who develops symptoms will eventually die from the infection.

**And how is that rate calculated?**

Ideally,  we would monitor a large group of people from the point at which they  develop symptoms until they later die or recover, then calculate the  proportion of all these cases who had died.

**So can we just look at the total number of deaths and the current number of cases?**

The  problem with just dividing the total number of deaths and total number  of cases is that it doesn‚Äôt account for unreported cases or the delay  from illness to death. The delay is crucial: If 100 people arrive at  hospital with Covid-19 on a given day, and all are currently still  alive, it obviously doesn‚Äôt mean that the fatality rate is 0 percent. We  need to wait until we know what happens to them eventually.

Any deaths  will be people who got sick two to three weeks ago, so it‚Äôs not simply  deaths at the moment divided by cases at the moment. Plus some cases  might be missed: If you have two deaths from two cases, as happened in  Iran last month, that most likely means you‚Äôve missed a bunch of cases.

**We‚Äôve seen all sorts of numbers for fatality rates. Does the latest estimate of 3.4 percent globally make sense?**

Early  on, people looked at total current cases and deaths, which, as I said,  is a flawed calculation, and concluded that the case fatality rate must  be 2 percent based on China data. If you run the same calculation on  yesterday‚Äôs totals for China, you get an apparent CFR (case fatality  rate) of near 4 percent. People are speculating that something is  happening with the virus, where it actually is just this statistical  illusion that we‚Äôve known about from Day 1. I‚Äôd say on best available  data, when we adjust for unreported cases and the various delays  involved, we‚Äôre probably looking at a fatality risk of probably between  maybe 0.5 and 2 percent for people with symptoms.

I had a [short Twitter thread explaining this (and predicting the rise) a couple of weeks ago](https://twitter.com/AdamJKucharski/status/1229708001243795458?s=20)

**What  about another number we hear about all the time, R, the reproductive  number, or how many people a given patient is likely to infect. Why is  it important and what goes into calculating it?**

At  its simplest, R is the answer to the question: How worried should we be  about infection? If R is above one, each case, on average, is giving it  to at least one other person. You‚Äôre going to see growth.

If  it‚Äôs less than one, then a group of infected people are generating less  infection. From a policy-planning point of view, it gives you a very  clear objective. For example, in the Ebola response in 2014, it was a  really prominent part of the response. The aim was to get R below one.

**That  seems very simple and straightforward, but you write that it‚Äôs more  complicated than it seems. In your book you say that to calculate R  you‚Äôve got to know duration, opportunity, transmission probability and  susceptibility (the ‚ÄúDOTS‚Äù). Let‚Äôs take them one by one. What is  duration?**

How long someone is  infectious. If someone is infectious twice as long, then that‚Äôs twice  as long that they are around to spread infection.

**Do we know what the duration is for this coronavirus?**

On  average, we‚Äôd probably be looking at a week or two. Of course, if  people get hospitalized, then they‚Äôre not in the community spreading  infection in the same way.

**The second component is opportunity. How do you determine that?**

That‚Äôs  a measure of how many people you come into contact with for every day  you‚Äôre infectious. With something like flu, you‚Äôre not infectious very  long but a lot of your interactions could potentially spread it. Whereas  with something like HIV, the duration is much longer but the number of  sexual partners you have relative to the number of conversations you  have is obviously much lower.

**And transmission probability?**

This  is a measure of the chance the infection will get across during an  interaction. For example, during a sexual encounter, the virus won‚Äôt  necessarily get across.

**Finally there‚Äôs susceptibility. How do you determine that?**

Susceptibility  measures the chance the person at the other end of the interaction will  pick up the infection and become infectious themselves.

**Once you‚Äôve got numbers for these four components, what‚Äôs the equation to come up with R?**

If  you multiply them together, you get the reproduction number. So if you  scale up or scale down any one of these things, it directly affects the  value of R.

**How does this knowledge help public health planning?**

Generally,  susceptibility is the easiest one to reduce if we have things like  vaccines. If we don‚Äôt, then we have to think about targeting the other  aspects of transmission, such as reducing opportunities through social  distancing, or probability of transmission during things like handshakes  by encouraging hand washing.

**What if you‚Äôre not in public health, but are thinking about your own personal chances and what your behavior should be?**

If  you imagine you‚Äôve got a reproduction number of two, each person‚Äôs  infecting two others, on average. But some situations are more likely to  spread infection than others. We‚Äôve found for things like Covid-19,  it‚Äôs close-knit interactions that seem to be most important.

What  we need to think about ‚Äî and what a lot of our modeling is certainly  thinking about ‚Äî is not just how much transmission is happening, but  where is that transmission happening. If you‚Äôre going to change your  behavior, think how to reduce those risky situations as much as  possible.

**If you were the average person, what would you pay attention to ‚Äî in terms of the news and the numbers?**

One  signal to watch out for is if the first case in an area is a death or a  severe case, because that suggests you had a lot of community  transmission already. As a back of the envelope calculation, suppose the  fatality rate for cases is about 1 percent, which is plausible. If  you‚Äôve got a death, then that person probably became ill about three  weeks ago. That means you probably had about 100 cases three weeks ago,  in reality. In that subsequent three weeks, that number could well have  doubled, then doubled, then doubled again. So you‚Äôre currently looking  at 500 cases, maybe a thousand cases.

I  think the other thing that people do need to pay attention to is the  risk of severe disease and fatality, particularly in older groups, in  the over-70s, over-80s. Over all we‚Äôre seeing maybe 1 percent of  symptomatic cases are fatal across all ages. There‚Äôs still some  uncertainty on that, but what‚Äôs also important is that 1 percent isn‚Äôt  evenly distributed. In younger groups, we‚Äôre talking perhaps 0.1  percent, which means that when you get into the older groups, you‚Äôre  potentially talking about 5 percent, 10 percent of cases being fatal.

In thinking about social behavior and thinking about your interactions,  the question should be, ‚ÄúHow do we stop transmission getting into those  groups where the impact could be really severe?‚Äù"

We Spoke to Six Americans With Coronavirus

It is one thing to be sick. It is another not to know your chances of getting well. Americans who have had the virus share their experiences.


Text messages exchanged between Dale Grizzle and John Haering while they were hospitalized separately in Japan.

By¬†Amy Harmon

March 5, 2020,¬†2:51 p.m. ET

Late one night, after a test confirmed the stealth invasion of his cells by the new¬†coronavirus, Dale Grizzle was seized with a violent fit of vomiting in his hospital room.
Until then, Mr. Grizzle, 69, of Rydal, Ga., had maintained his trademark good spirits. Like most people who have contracted the virus, he had experienced mostly mild symptoms. 

But in that moment, Mr. Grizzle, a retired house painter with 13 grandchildren, found himself unable to fend off the darkness. ‚ÄúI got to thinking about, ‚ÄòIs my life going to end here?‚Äô‚Äù he recalled in a recent interview. ‚Äú‚ÄòIs this going to be it?‚Äô I had severe anxiety.‚Äù


Anxiety is exactly what many Americans are feeling as a virus that has infected nearly 100,000 people and claimed more than 3,000 lives across the world over the last eight weeks finds its first footholds in the United States. With health officials preparing the public for a widespread outbreak here, six Americans who have already tested positive for the virus spoke to The New York Times about its predictable and unexpected consequences.



Some, like Mark Jorgensen, 55, of St. George, Utah, have experienced no physical discomfort from Covid-19, as the disease brought on by the virus is known. Others cannot shake its signature symptoms, such as Carl Goldman and his two-week-old cough.
Isolated in hospital rooms, quarantine units or their own homes, some early Covid-19 patients turned to prayer or meditation. Many expressed new appreciation for FaceTime and other video-call apps that let them stay connected to loved ones. And some found comfort among other members of the¬†fast-expanding group of Americans¬†in similar straits.



With a potentially fatal virus hijacking their respiratory tract, small pleasures, like tasting a favorite food or catching a glimpse of a family pet, took on heightened meaning. The notion of communal responsibility for public health gained new resonance. And some who divulged their disease to friends or clients had an inkling that it could become a new marker of identity. ‚ÄúThey go, ‚ÄòHey, I know someone with coronavirus!‚Äô Like it‚Äôs a badge of honor,‚Äù noted Rick Wright, of Redwood City, Calif.



But that did not stop them from despairing over their own status as a reservoir of infection,¬†or fearing ostracism. Nor did it make the defining uncertainty of the disease, which had never been seen in humans before it was¬†detected in China in December, easier to bear.
They worried about dying. They worried about living, with unknown debilitating effects on their bodies. They worried about the tests required to prove that they were virus-free ‚Äî the nasal swabs that made their eyes water and the throat swabs that made.

It is one thing to be sick. It is another not to know your chances of getting well, and to know that calculating those chances depended on how many others were sick, and to know that no one knew that, either.



Alone on that night in mid-February, Mr. Grizzle said, the fear that gripped him eased as he prayed. The next day, he texted John Haering, who, like himself, had contracted the virus on the Diamond Princess cruise ship last month as it was docked in Japan.

Get an informed guide to the global outbreak with our daily¬†coronavirus¬†newsletter.

The two men, who had met on the ship with their wives, were among some 40 American passengers admitted to hospitals in Japan. Mr. Grizzle had been escorted off the boat on Feb. 11.


‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs the word?‚Äù he typed to Mr. Haering two days later.
‚ÄúHey Dale,‚Äù came the reply. ‚ÄúIn hospital too. Hate it already.‚Äù



‚ÄúIt‚Äôs fear, it‚Äôs every bad emotion you could have.‚Äù One woman fights to help her mother on lockdown in a virus-affected nursing home.



Before the ship entered quarantine mode, when the couples thought their cruise was coming to its regularly scheduled end, they had vowed to stay in touch.


But not until their wives were evacuated to a 14-day quarantine at a California military base while they remained hospitalized in Japan did Mr. Haering and Mr. Grizzle actually lay plans to take their families on another vacation together.



‚ÄúWe want to sit in the beautiful, un-diseased waters of the Caribbean,‚Äù Mr. Haering said during a joint interview with Mr. Grizzle over WhatsApp.
‚ÄúWe just want to float around,‚Äù Mr. Grizzle added.
It was a welcome distraction. Both men had recorded 104-degree fevers. Each received CT scans of their lungs that revealed pneumonia. Both were haunted by¬†the death of a doctor in China¬†who had been reprimanded for trying to alert people early on to the viral outbreak.

Mr. Haering, like Mr. Grizzle, also suffered some combination of gastrointestinal distress and existential angst. The coronavirus death rate, they knew, was about 2 percent, which sounded low. But then, the world‚Äôs case count kept mounting. So did the cruise ship‚Äôs. With over 700 infected passengers and crew members, the odds did not look as good. And they were worse for people over the age of 60.

‚ÄúYou start thinking, ‚ÄòOh my gosh, do they really not know anything about this? Could I die?‚Äô‚Äù said Mr. Haering, who is 63.

A recently retired operations manager for Union Pacific railroad, Mr. Haering said his fever had broken even before he reached the hospital. That soon made him eligible to take the first of two tests that would need to come back negative for the virus in order for him to leave.

‚ÄúHave you ever had a nose swab?‚Äù he texted Mr. Grizzle on Feb. 21.
Mr. Grizzle, whose low-grade fever was lingering, had not. But he did have what he knew Mr. Haering craved: a hamburger. The food at their respective hospitals had provided much conversational fodder, and Mr. Grizzle had just learned how to order in. He texted back a photograph.
‚ÄúI love french fries,‚Äù Mr. Haering replied, with a touch of envy. ‚ÄúWere they still warm? Salty, I hope.‚Äù

‚ÄúLet‚Äôs live it up a little,‚Äù Mr. Grizzle replied sometime later. ‚ÄúCan I call?‚Äù
They celebrated the negative test result that Mr. Haering‚Äôs wife, Melanie, had received at the base in California, and the consistent reports from Mr. Grizzle‚Äôs wife, Sherry, that she had virtually no symptoms despite being hospitalized for the virus, first in San Francisco and then at a hospital in Spokane, Wash.
When Mr. Haering did get the all-clear on Saturday to return to his home in Tooele, Utah, Mr. Grizzle insisted that he was happy for his friend.

‚ÄúWe kind of have developed a brotherhood,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúA brotherhood of the virus.‚Äù
Mr. Haering texted him a photograph of his dinner on Friday night as he awaited a flight. It included warm, salty french fries.
‚ÄúNow that‚Äôs what I‚Äôm talking about!‚Äù Mr. Grizzle replied. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs a great-looking plate.""

No Symptoms, but Quarantined

The doctor from San Mateo County‚Äôs health department was waiting on Rick Wright‚Äôs front porch in Redwood City when the ambulance dropped him off.
From 30 feet away, the doctor indicated that Mr. Wright was to read the paperwork he had left before entering. Following instructions, Mr. Wright entered his home and called the doctor, who spoke to him from his car parked outside.
He was not to go outside. He was not to accept visitors.
The distancing protocol made sense for someone with a highly infectious disease for which there is no treatment. And Mr. Wright has tested positive for the virus three times since mid-February. First, when health officials seeking to assess the contagion on the Diamond Princess swabbed his throat and then twice more during his eight-day stay at a Northern California hospital."

##Statement by a quarantined nurse from a northern California Kaiser facility
**March 5, 2020**

>As a nurse, I‚Äôm very concerned that not enough is being done to stop the spread of the coronavirus. I know 
because I am currently sick and in quarantine after caring for a patient who tested positive. I‚Äôm awaiting
‚Äúpermission‚Äù from the federal government to allow for my testing, even after my physician and county 
health professional ordered it. 

>I volunteered to be on the care team for this patient, who we knew was positive. I did this because I had all 
the recommended protective gear and training from my employer. I did this assuming that if something 
happened to me, of course I too would be cared for. Then, what was a small concern after a few days of 
caring for this patient, became my reality:
I started getting sick. 

>When employee health told me that my fever and other symptoms fit the criteria for potential coronavirus, 
I was put on a 14-day self-quarantine. Since the criteria was met, the testing would be done. My doctor 
ordered the test through the county. 

>The public county officer called me and verified my symptoms and agreed with testing. But the National 
CDC would not initiate testing. They said they would not test me because if I were wearing the 
recommended protective equipment, then I wouldn‚Äôt have the coronavirus. 

>What kind of science-based answer is that? What a ridiculous and uneducated response from the 
department that is in charge of our health in this country. 
Later, they called back, and now it‚Äôs an issue with something called the ‚Äúidentifier number.‚Äù They claim 
they prioritize running samples by illness severity and that there are only so many to give out each day. So I 
have to wait in line to find out the results. 

>This is not the ticket dispenser at the deli counter; it‚Äôs a public health emergency! I am a registered nurse, 
and I need to know if I am positive before going back to caring for patients.

>I am appalled at the level of bureaucracy that‚Äôs preventing nurses from getting tested. That is a health care 
decision my doctor and my county health department agree with. Delaying this test puts the whole 
community at risk. 

>I have the backing of my union. Nurses aren‚Äôt going to stand by and let this testing delay continue; we are 
going to stand together to make sure we can protect our patients‚Äîby being protected ourselves."

Helicopters carrying coronavirus test kits arrived Thursday morning at the Grand Princess cruiseliner, passengers reported, as the San Francisco-bound ship was being held for a second day off the coast of California with possible cases of the illness.

A passenger aboard the ship and the relative of another said the helicopters arrived before noon. A video posted on Twitter by Keane Li, who said his parents are aboard the craft, showed what appeared to be military helicopters hovering close to or above the boat.

There are about 2,500 passengers and 500 crew members aboard the ship.

California Gov. Gavin Newsom said Wednesday about 200 test kits ‚Äî enough to test several hundred people ‚Äî [would be airlifted to the ship.](https://www.sfchronicle.com/bayarea/article/First-coronavirus-California-death-tied-to-San-15105417.php) Once test results are in, authorities with the CDC, the California Department of Public Health and the U.S. Coast Guard will develop a plan for meeting the Grand Princess when it docks, Newsom said.

Though there are no confirmed passengers yet with coronavirus, some are showing symptoms, authorities said. At least two passengers who were on an earlier trip to Mexico aboard the ship came down with the disease ‚Äî one them a 71-year-old Placer County man who died Wednesday and another person from Sonoma County who remains hospitalized.

The ship left San Francisco for a 15-day trip to Hawaii about eight hours after it returned from the Mexico trip, and had planned to return early after the virus was connected to the boat. The ship is holding [about 70 miles southwest of San Francisco.](https://www.sfchronicle.com/coronavirus/item/Location-of-the-Diamond-Princess-95054.php)

The ship is operated by Princess Cruises. Another Princess Cruises ship ‚Äî the Diamond Princess ‚Äî had a large outbreak of coronavirus off the coast of Japan that ultimately infected more than 700 people out of about 4,000 passengers and staff who were on board at the time. Six people died in that outbreak.

Neil Kran, a 69-year-old Sausalito resident, said he had been relaxing aboard the Grand Princess cruise ship with his wife for days until a piece of paper was slipped beneath their door Wednesday morning informing them the ship would skip its last stop because of the death.

‚ÄúThe mood of people we‚Äôve talked to is just kind of somber,‚Äù Kran said. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre caught up and there‚Äôs not much we can do about it.‚Äù

Lisa Egan, whose 90-year-old father Cliff is aboard the cruise with friends, said passengers have not received any updates since the Wednesday slip.

‚ÄúNow they are just anchored someone in international waters,‚Äù Egan said. ‚ÄúThey are in hurry up and wait mode.‚Äù

Cruise officials did not immediately respond to an inquiry about the ship‚Äôs most recent location."

Obviously there‚Äôs a lot of unstated personal understanding of her mindset, but that said... any tweaks? More concise phrasings? Glaring omissions? Thanks for all the suggestions!


Edit: numbering keeps getting messed up, but it‚Äôll be correct in the email.


1.	Sanders is endorsed by both Greenpeace and the Sunrise Movement as the best candidate - even better than Warren was - to deal with climate change. The scientific consensus is overwhelming: we have ten years to deal with the worst case scenarios and we‚Äôve already failed to prevent inevitable famines. The few scientists who argue otherwise are invariably funded by glaring conflicts of interest like fossil fuel companies. Biden‚Äôs plan would wean us off fossil fuels by 2050, twenty years too late.


2.	Biden‚Äôs healthcare plan involves minor tweaks in a country where people are constantly begging for help paying medical bills on gofundme. Remember how hated the individual mandate was? He wants to bring that back. Sanders is pushing for the incredibly popular Medicare For All that occasionally gets majority support even amongst republicans. Quite a few people who favor M4A voted for Biden regardless because they saw him as the safer choice, but he isn‚Äôt for all of these reasons I‚Äôm listing. Also, quite a few weren‚Äôt aware that Biden opposes M4A.


2a.  People are getting charged thousands of dollars to do the responsible thing and get coronavirus diagnosed. Right now, the rational choice for poor people is to not get diagnosed and to continue going to work. Biden would do nothing to change this. Sanders would try.


3.	Although Biden‚Äôs cognitive decline might be overstated, though I don‚Äôt think it is, it is something that Trump will exploit mercilessly and effectively. Clinton couldn‚Äôt combat his nastiness effectively, and Biden is less eloquent than she was. Move over, crooked Hillary, here comes sleepy Joe.


4.	Most of these points won‚Äôt affect you personally, just as the Trump administration hasn‚Äôt directly affected you. Sanders is, in part, banking on people looking past their immediate surroundings. One of his best rallying cries is this: are you willing to fight for someone you don‚Äôt even know? Unless enough people are willing to fight for those who are out numbered or can‚Äôt afford to go to the polls or have their votes suppressed by the Republicans and the Democrats, their lives won‚Äôt get better. Biden, in contrast, had ‚Äúno empathy‚Äù for the struggles of today‚Äôs youth because the civil rights era was tougher (more on that later), and responded to an Iraq War veteran with dead friends by saying that his son died, too. Ironically, if you want a Christian candidate, your best bet is the Jew.


5.	Biden was a segregationist who opposed bussing, a sexual harassment apologist who shouted down Anita Hill, and one of the biggest boosters of the Iraq War that killed hundreds of thousands and accomplished nothing more than making military contractors even richer. Trump will make all of this work for him. We saw in 2016 that it hardly matters if Trump‚Äôs attacks are hypocritical. The point is to demoralize the democrats and it‚Äôll work.


6.	Biden‚Äôs whole thing is returning to the Obama years. Those same years that demoralized democrats and enraged republicans to the extent that the democrats lost all three branches of government and succumbed to a racist celebrity. He stands for the trade deals that helped Clinton lose the Midwest. He won‚Äôt do anything to capture the voters who went from Obama to Trump because he won‚Äôt fundamentally be offering anything different than what Clinton did. Trump won because ‚ÄúAmerica is already great‚Äù was a losing argument for the working poor.


7.	Sanders, by far, has the most youth engagement, the biggest field operation, more individual donors than anyone, the biggest crowds, and the best argument that he‚Äôd be an agent of change. Remember, the last time a democrat won the presidency, it was ostensibly as an agent of change. Clinton told us that America is already great and Biden told rich donors that nothing will fundamentally change under his administration. Biden usually gets under 10% of the youth vote. We don‚Äôt win if they‚Äôre not engaged.


8.	Biden was doing horribly until the establishment - Pete, Amy, Bloomberg, Clyburn, etc. - rallied around him. His speaking skills are abysmal and his rallies are sparse. He‚Äôs being carried by the elites to a nail-biter of a victory, if that. All those elites rallying overwhelmingly behind Clinton - and much sooner - couldn‚Äôt carry her past the finish line. We‚Äôre just going to try the same thing again?


9.	Most polls show Bernie beating Trump, and more recently they show him beating Trump by a higher margin than Biden. Biden gets much more flattering media coverage than Bernie does. He‚Äôs not going through the crucible like Bernie is. Remember how Obama called Clinton the most qualified candidate in history? Remember what happened next? It‚Äôs a terrible mistake to handle primary candidates with kid gloves. We should be using this time to find out who‚Äôs the hardier candidate. But that‚Äôs largely not happening with Biden. Compare with all the silly attacks they‚Äôve been launching against Sanders, including holding him responsible for the behavior of each of his millions of supporters. No other candidate gets held to that standard. They‚Äôre showing us how Sanders would fare with tough crowds. They‚Äôre not doing the same for Biden."

Rice public safety officers learned of the case Feb. 29 and took immediate action to ensure the safety and well-being of those involved and the broader Rice community, including undergraduate and graduate students, faculty and staff.

The affected employee's presence on campus was limited to one building, which has been extensively and continuously sanitized along with the rest of the campus. Based on our investigation,¬†the staff member¬†had no direct contact with our undergraduate population and has not been in any residential colleges or classrooms since returning to Houston Feb. 20.

The Rice Crisis Management Team continues to take measures to protect everyone's health and safety. We are working closely with Harris County Public Health and the Houston Health Department to manage the situation.

At this time, we are not planning to suspend campus operations or classes. Going forward, we will continue to follow the guidance of the CDC and Harris County Public Health.

University staff are maintaining an intensified cleaning program, and the university recommends that individuals practice proper handwashing as suggested by the World Health Organization (using soap and water for at least 20 seconds) and general hygiene, cover coughs and stay home if sick. More information is available at https://emergency.rice.edu/coronavirus."

But if they play up the threat, they can't *downplay* the threat with reassurances from the government that make Trump seem like a sound leader navigating us through a crisis.

Everyone take a breath... you don‚Äôt need more toilet paper! That won‚Äôt help with the Coronavirus BUT HERES SOME INFORMATION THAT WILL! 

82,000 People are sick with Coronavirus at the moment, of which 77,000 are in China.
This means that if you are not in or haven't recently visited China, this should eliminate 94% of your concern.

If you do contract Coronavirus, this still is not a cause for panic because:
81% of the Cases are MILD
14% of the Cases are MODERATE
Only 5% of the Cases are CRITICAL

Which means that even if you do get the virus, you are most likely to recover from it.

Some have said, ‚Äúbut this is worse than SARS!‚Äù. SARS had a fatality rate of 10% while COVID-19 has a fatality rate of 3.4%

Moreover, looking at the ages of those who are dying of this virus, the death rate for the people UNDER 50 years of age is only 0.2%

This means that if you are under 50 years of age and don't live in China - you are more likely to win the lottery (which has a 1 in 45,000,000 chance)

Let‚Äôs take one of the worst days so far, the 10th of February, when 108 people in CHINA died of Coronavirus.

On the same day:
26,283 people died of Cancer,

Jan 30 . I (27), school teacher, live in Las Vegas . I caught a respiratory virus. Felt like COMPLETE trash within 3 hours, body aches. By noon at the school I felt so weak, I couldn't stand for my last class. Bad dry cough develops at night. I just pass out. I had the flu last October and it was mild in comparison.

Jan 31, Skip work. I'm at the doctor. Negative for flu. No other tests, doc clear me for travel says I'm good to travel. At this time I didn't even consider if I had coronavirus, just some weird intense virus.  at night it gets bad. 103 fever, dry cough. Fever so high feels like I have sunburn, I pass out at some point. I have no memory of anything after. 

Feb 1st. I wake up at 102 fever, my family forced me to stay home and cancel trip. Spreads to my 55 year old father, smoker. Hits him even worse. 103 fever. He's hacking and coughing. VA says to just drink water, no need for appointment.

Feb 2nd. My mother catches it, 102 fever, aches, cough. All the same symptoms. I have to play nurse. 

Feb 3rd. I feel like hell but I recover slowly from then on. My girlfriend never caught it, but her mother did. 

It took 1.5 weeks for me to get better. 4 days for my mother and my gf's mother. My father, it lingers in him for 3 weeks. He confides he felt like he was going to die a few times.

Hello everybody, it's ya boi, Radio Torrejon de Ardoz, bringing you regular updates from the Iberian Peninsula in its current fight against the Coronavirus.

First things first, me and my dad are still doing fine. We've both taken all of the measures we could do, and we're ready to ride this one out. Don't mistake my words for world-ending prepping, we just want to make sure that we can ride this out without any of us falling sick, of course. I hope that all of you are doing well so far too, ladies and gents. 

I have to confirm that we lost another person to the Virus here, making the official death count to 3. It was a 99 year old woman, who was living at a caretaker's home. Due to this, I have to assume that the residence, along with some of the older people in it, might be infected with it. The community's government is considering the option to close the caretaker homes until the crisis passes, but it has not been enforced yet.

Now that the regular update has been done, I  want to bring some sort of discussion to this. Something that I have noticed a long time ago.

'What is the cost of lies?'. Those words, who will always stay with me, were uttered by Valery Alekseyevich Legasov in the series of 'Chernobyl', portrayed by Jared Harris (blessed be his name). In the series, he uttered those words as criticism against the soviet apparatchik, and its blame culture, that contributed to the disastrous initial response to the disaster itself. The cost of lies is always great, and it will always collect its due, no matter how hard you try to hide it. We have seen how lies can make a problem grow worse. We have seen people flatout lying about this virus in order to promote homeopathic treatments that will not work against this. Hell, we've even seen some of the most insane theories still being paraded as 'absolute truth' (The Bioweapon theory, for instance)

Overall, do not give up. That is my recommendation to everyone that is involved in this subreddit. Your stories always bring a smile to my face, and your worries are the same as mine. I have a father who has diabetes. Not a genetical  problem, something he contracted some years ago. He doesnt need insulin, just takes some meds ocasionally, and he's had a very good diet so far. I'm proud of him, and I'm happy that he managed to do so. I have the lingering worry that somehow, this could cause him more complications, since the ministry of Health has classified it as a risk factor.

I will not lie. I am scared shitless when I think of that possibility. And I'm scared shitless because if it happens, I will be powerless to stop it. I only want to ask, can a very mild diabetes cause complications? How, and why? I need an answer to that, just the full truth.

Besides of that, I think I've already done all I could. Writing like this is the most effective coping mechanism I could find, besides of video games, and i'm happy that you're listening to my rambles. I'll still keep the updates coming, unless Corona-Chan takes my breath away all of a sudden, but I don't see that happening yet. What I will do today though, is start 'Narcos' all over again with my dad, and go back to Total War Warhammer. Sadly, the Skaven campaign was a bust, so i'll just play the Dwarves for this one. I hope that you all keep being awesome, people. Keep calm, and carry on."

I volunteered to be on the care team for this patient, who we knew was positive. I did this because I had all the recommended protective gear and training from my employer. I did this assuming that if something happened to me, of course I too would be cared for. Then, what was a small concern after a few days of caring for this patient, became my reality: 

I started getting sick.

When employee health told me that my fever and other symptoms fit the criteria for potential coronavirus, I was put on a 14-day self-quarantine. Since the criteria was met, the testing would be done. My doctor ordered the test through the county.

The public county officer called me and verified my symptoms and agreed with testing. But the National CDC would not initiate testing. They said they would not test me because if I were wearing the recommended protective equipment, then I wouldn‚Äôt have the coronavirus.

What kind of science-based answer is that? What a ridiculous and uneducated response from thedepartment that is in charge of our health in this country.

Later, they called back, and now it‚Äôs an issue with something called the ‚Äúidentifier number.‚Äù They claim they prioritize running samples by illness severity and that there are only so many to give out each day. So I have to wait in line to find out the results.

This is not the ticket dispenser at the deli counter; it‚Äôs a public health emergency! I am a registered nurse, and I need to know if I am positive before going back to caring for patients.

I am appalled at the level of bureaucracy that‚Äôs preventing nurses from getting tested. That is a health care decision my doctor and my county health department agree with. Delaying this test puts the whole community at risk.

I have the backing of my union. Nurses aren‚Äôt going to stand by and let this testing delay continue; we are going to stand together to make sure we can protect our patients‚Äîby being protected ourselves."

People here think very very short term, very short term. 

Ibio has facilities that would produce the vaccine. The vaccine that isn't ready for production yet. Ibio's potential is not in the present, it's in the future - which is at odds with the sub. 

I promise you, if/when the vaccine becomes mass produced and ibio is one of the major facilities producing it this sub will happily jump on to the bandwagon again the day that is discovered. 

People invest in companies when they see future value and current value. This sub only invests on current value, or very short notice of future value - like OPK. 

Is this a get rich quick a sub? Yea, kinda. But that's in the nature of smaller valued stocks. 

And coronavirus stocks are a mix between immediately value and short future value stocks. Some have taken off like rocket ships already and then settled down like AHPI, others haven't begun their take off yet because it's too soon for that companies specific role. 

Right now, I would imagine Ibio's facilities are prepping for future expectations of producing a vaccine but for this sub, thats not a big interest because it's too far in the future it's not as much of a sure thing.

Long term vs short term. You're looking long term for this sub. This sub is looking for waking up tomorrow morning with OPK opening at $5 and taking their $1500 dollars with a smile. Nothing wrong with that at all. Just a different mentality."

We only arrived at that 2% number for Spanish Flu years after the pandemic, where we had a larger data pool to draw conclusions from. Mortality rates are always significantly higher at the beginning of an outbreak, because our first contact with patients is usually via those who are sick enough to need hospitalization. Which is to say, there is no point comparing the 3.8% (which has already dropped) to the 2% number for Spanish Flu. At this point, they don't mean the same thing, and they can't be compared.

The mortality rate in South Korea - currently the largest outbreak outside of China, with the largest numbers of tests conducted (thereby the largest data pool) - has a mortality rate of 0.6-0.7 percent. That's affecting overall numbers if you include them with China. The same calculation used to yield 3.8% now gives 3.4%. That's a change from *just yesterday to today*.

Again, it's incredibly early, and as more cases become apparent it's likely the mortality rate will fall. When Swine Flu hit scientists were initially claiming a 10% mortality rate, but with enough data after the fact it dropped to below 1%, and that was a pandemic that infected 25% of the entire planet just a little over 10 years ago. 

As of right now, over half of all reported cases have already recovered, and of the remaining cases, 84% of them are listed as mild. Which means, right now in terms of confirmed cases, there's only a little more than 6,000 cases worldwide that need hospitalization.

 FOGGIA - San Marco in Lamis can become, or has already become, Puglia‚Äôs Codogno.  
The ""catastrophic error"" of a coroner who issued the authorization to the funeral of a 75 year old before the outcome of the swab carried out on the man to verify the presence of the virus was known.  Those funerals were celebrated and the virus might have spread uncontrollably, causing an unknown number of infections.  The official ones are four (two relatives of the victim, the general practitioner and his wife) but it is a destined to grow.

""For a series of absurdities the swab had been carried out and then in an incredible way the corpse had been released for the funeral before the outcome of the test. It is clear that in the face of a catastrophic error of the coroner of this type there is no it is a remedy ""admitted the governor Michele Emiliano.

The former civil servant traveled to Cremona, Lombardy between late January and early February. The man returned to Puglia on February 16th and informed his general practitioner that he had been in the area at risk of contagion. A few days after his return he felt the first symptoms and on the evening of February 27th he died at home. The next day the body was taken to the hospital of San Severo (Foggia) and subsequently to the mortuary in San Marco in Lamis. On March 3rd, a few hours before the outcome of the swab was known, the funeral was celebrated in the ""La Collegiata"" church of San Marco in Lamis.

At the end of the funeral, the Bari Polyclinic communicated the positivity to the coronavirus, but it was already too late. The man was well known, hundreds of people attended the funeral, hugs, handshakes. For all, at least for those who could be reached, the quarantine took place, the schools were closed and the market postponed. It is feared that the virus may spread rapidly and, in the afternoon, another man from San Nicandro Garganico, a teacher, tested positive for Coronavirus and is now hospitalized in the intensive care unit of the San Giovanni Rotondo hospital. The emergency room was closed as a precaution.

""In the North of Puglia there are situations that we have difficulty controlling,"" said Emiliano.  The reference is to this town on the heights of the Gargano which has just under 14 thousand inhabitants.  ""Very intense measures are needed. I asked the prime minister for intensive action in the Foggiano area - continued Emiliano - we must act quickly but we have difficulty closing the cluster"". The Puglia Region has asked for the establishment of a red zone."

Thousands more people in the U.S. will likely be getting tested for the new coronavirus in the coming days ‚Äî including many passengers aboard the Grand Princess cruise ship whose scheduled return to the Port of San Francisco was [delayed Wednesday](https://www.sfchronicle.com/bayarea/article/Grand-Princess-2-500-on-board-some-sick-15106141.php) so passengers could be tested for the virus. Two passengers who had disembarked from a previous cruise on the same ship have tested positive for the virus, including a Placer County man who [died](https://www.sfchronicle.com/bayarea/article/First-coronavirus-California-death-tied-to-San-15105417.php) Wednesday, California‚Äôs first death from the virus.

If earlier coronavirus patients‚Äô experience with lab testing is any indication, some may soon be receiving confusing test results.

[Rick Wright,](https://www.sfchronicle.com/business/article/What-it-s-like-to-be-a-coronavirus-patient-in-15086579.php) a Redwood City resident who‚Äôs been self-quarantining at home since being released from UCSF last week, has taken seven coronavirus tests over the last two weeks that have reaped different results: negative one day, positive the next, positive a couple days later, negative the day after that, and then inconclusive. He‚Äôs now awaiting the results of two more tests he took on Monday and Tuesday. Wright has not shown any symptoms of the virus. He was among the passengers of the Diamond Princess cruise ship who were evacuated from Japan and quarantined at Travis Air Force Base.

Wright is not the only confirmed coronavirus case whose test results came back differently within a short span of time. A Wuhan evacuee who was quarantined at Lackland Air Force Base in San Antonio was released this week after testing negative twice, per the CDC‚Äôs guidance on testing. But a subsequent test came back positive, and authorities had to put her back into quarantine and trace the people she came into contact with during the time she was out.

Experts say the conflicting results are probably not because the test itself is inaccurate, but rather because the virus can sometimes appear more strongly in a specimen from one part of the body, like the lower respiratory tract, than in a specimen from another part of the body, like the nose or throat ‚Äî or vice versa. The coronavirus test can be done using a sample from the nose, throat or phlegm coughed up from the lungs.

‚ÄúThere might be extreme virus in one part of the body but not the other ... because of the way the disease is progressing in that individual,‚Äù said Kelly Wroblewski, director of infectious disease at the Association of Public Health Laboratories.

Because it is a new virus and a new test, medical experts are still trying to determine when exactly is the best time to start testing people, and how often subsequent tests should be done.

‚ÄúShedding‚Äù the virus ‚Äî viruses in cells replicating and becoming detectable by lab tests ‚Äî can happen at different rates at different times. Someone in the very early stages of infection may not test positive even though they have contracted the virus. And as the infection progresses, the amount of virus in the body may fluctuate.

‚ÄúThat it‚Äôs there one day, gone the next and gone the third day could reflect real differences in shedding in the patient,‚Äù said Dr. Art Reingold, an infectious disease expert at UC Berkeley School of Public Health. ‚ÄúIt could be your immune system or the amount of virus you have goes up and down.‚Äù

And, as is the case with lab testing of any kind, there is the possibility of lab error or a bad sample.

‚ÄúFrankly, to someone who thinks about these things in the context of diagnosing stuff, these are all pretty common issues, and not unique to this virus,‚Äù Reingold said.

Still, it poses a challenge to public health officials with the coronavirus when they are trying to determine when a patient is ‚Äúclear‚Äù to be released from a mandatory quarantine, or free to leave the house if they‚Äôve been self-isolating at home.

The way coronavirus tests are being done is called a ‚Äútest of cure‚Äù ‚Äî a patient gets tested repeatedly until they consistently show negative results. This is also the way TB patients get tested before they can be released from isolation, Wroblewski said. This kind of testing is more difficult than, say, a more clear-cut flu test, especially when it‚Äôs being done for an emerging infectious disease whose behavior is still a bit of a mystery.

‚ÄúNormally when you test someone for flu, it‚Äôs diagnostic ‚Äî if it‚Äôs negative, it‚Äôs negative,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not going to get these serial tests to get cleared. When you‚Äôre in containment phase and you‚Äôre trying to isolate people who might be transmitting the virus, you‚Äôre using diagnostic tests very differently than you do under normal circumstances. It‚Äôs challenging.‚Äù"

> 
> The Spanish flu hit during the first world war, so authorities were unusually keen to avoid further social disruption or blows to national morale. Much of the pandemic was characterised by increasingly untenable reassurances that the Spanish flu was not something to be overly concerned about. In June 1918, just before the UK felt the full force of the outbreak, the Daily Mail advised readers that flu was no worse than a cold and that people should not have ‚Äúany great dread‚Äù but ‚Äúmaintain a cheery outlook on life‚Äù. The Times initially adopted a casual, jokey tone before growing critical of official complacency.
> 
> 3) Uncontrolled movement can lead to tragic outcomes
> 
> The unusual circumstances of the first world war reversed the normal pattern of human movement in a pandemic. Instead of the sickest people staying put in bed, many were sent home from the frontline, which may have contributed to the rapid spread of the disease. And many countries struggled to balance national war interests with public health.
> 
> In New Zealand, which was slow to clamp down on ships entering and leaving its ports, nearly 1% of the population died within two months in late 1918, triggering even worse outbreaks in Pacific territories such as Western Samoa, where 30% of men, 22% of women and 10% of children died.
> 
> By contrast, the coronavirus outbreak has prompted draconian clampdowns on civil life. The World Health Organization has credited the response in China, where entire cities were placed in lockdown and schools and work suspended, with averting hundreds of thousands of cases of Covid-19.
> 
> 4) The potential for a second wave
> 
> The first wave of Spanish flu in spring 1918 wasn‚Äôt that bad. But by August, when a second wave spread from France across Europe, the US and much of the globe, the virus had mutated to a far deadlier form and appeared to hit hardest in regions that had not already been exposed, meaning people had lower immunity.
> 
> Flu viruses are fundamentally different from coronaviruses in that they are constantly shuffling their genomes, which means they rapidly morph from one strain into another ‚Äì that‚Äôs why flu vaccines are needed annually. Coronaviruses tend to be genetically fairly stable and so scientists don‚Äôt expect a sudden shift in the mortality rate of Covid-19. But the question of whether coronavirus will disappear, reappear in waves or simmer in the background as an endemic illness still remains to be answered.
> 
> Viruses where transmission is strongly affected by temperature and humidity often come in waves and initially it was expected that Covid-19 might die down in the spring and possibly reappear next winter. But the geographic spread is already raising questions about this."
2020-03-05,PradyKK,india,9,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/fdx8cz/why_coronavirus_doesnt_scare_indians/fjla08b/,"Actually a possibility. Coronaviruses in general are known to interact with influenza viruses and other coronaviruses and mutate. So it's possible the already infectious coronavirus could cannibalise a more deadly but less infectious strain of another virus and become highly lethal. The nearest one I can think of is MERS which has a 40% mortality rate and which is prevalent in the Arabian peninsula so good luck to us all now that it's spreading there. We also have a H1N1 (Swine Flu) epidemic right now in India and that could interact with this Coronavirus too. Of course we may not see a mutation like this for maybe another year or more, if ever we do, so we're ok for now. 

Same thing happened with the 1918 Influenza Pandemic (Spanish Flu). There was a milder strain that was spreading around for a year or so before it mutated into a deadlier strain. Those who got the milder strain were actually immune to the deadlier one that came later so they got lucky. But World War 1 played a big role in spreading that around. Normally if people are mildly ill they go about their business and spread the milder strain around and if people are severely ill they usually stay at home and limit the spread of any deadlier strains. But with the war going on, if someone was mildly ill, they stayed on the front lines and died, limiting it's spread, but if they were severely ill they were put on crowded hospital trains and sent home thus enabling the deadlier version of the virus to spread. We don't have a major war on right now so less likely that any lethal mutation will spread so easily. Interestingly while the deadly strain hit in the spring of 1918, the real damage happened in the autumn of that year when temperatures went down again. So if we can learn anything from this rather impromptu history lesson, it is that we're only at the beginning of this pandemic and while it could look like it's under control in the summer, autumn is the real test and it could get out of hand. So it really isn't over until the fat lady sings."

It is mutating, as all viruses do, but rather slowly. Much slower than influenza or HIV. and the virus isnt mutating ""collectively"".

> that it can enter the nervous system or brain of the patients 

There has indeed been a confirmed case in Beijing of COVID-19 infecting the central nervous system of a patient. 
This is not a surprise nor does it come unexpected. SARS, MERS , H1N1  and H5N1 influenza have ALL been recorded to be able to infect the CNS of the infected. However this is a rare occurence and will be a very rare occurence with COVID-19.

Even the existing  Human coronaviruses NL63, OC43 and 229E, which exist all over the world and are responsible of 25% for all ""common cold"" diseases worldwide, have been recorded to cause CNS infections in rare cases. 

>and that there is a patient who died after being discharged from the hospital and declared recovered and that recovered people are falling ill again

This has been observed indeed. The simple explanation is that people have been discharged before they have been truly fully recovered and the disease has relapsed. Also most of these people dont actually fall ill again, but simply test positive(Many chinese hospitals/provinces mandate follow up virus tests during time of recovery). majority never show symptoms and they test negative again after some time. Relapses also happen with influenza.

One thing to remember when new information of this virus comes out is that *is this actually something new, or is it something that is known to happen with similair viruses already and thus it's something rather expected?*

So far there is not a single special thing about Covid-19 that hasnt been observed with SARS and influenza years ago.


OH and the patient in question with the nervous system infection? He made a full recovery."

But, the Coronavirus situation is so powerful that it could be doomed. The business is either a great buy or totally worthless.

RC owns its ships which depreciate over 30 years. If the market for cruises tanks internationally then RC will be stuck with ships that won't have much value. It will be able to save on some costs like fuel, but fundamentally it's a business with massive fixed costs that is toast if it's ships are at low capacity for a while.

It's too early to tell at this point, but personally I wouldn't want to risk being quarantined on a boat full of sick people, even after this particular virus has run its course.

I think a reasonable analogy is 9/11 and airlines. It took three years for passenger numbers to recover to their pre 9/11 levels and the airlines needed a $15bn bailout to survive. 
Eventually the industry did recover and flight numbers are way higher now, but weak operators without a cash bailout would not have survived.

I can't imagine the government bailing out cruise lines and, to me, cruises are such a specific thing that consumers could replace with 'safer' vacations elsewhere. If so, RC will be stuck with $10bn of ships it can't sell, and trips sailing at a loss for years.

I can't say for sure that it's doomed, but it's definitely a gamble to invest at this point."

We were informed of a positive case of COVID-19 (coronavirus) within Trinity College Dublin late on Thursday night (March 5). We are now working closely with the authorities to ensure that this individual receives the best care possible.


The HSE will trace anyone who has been in contact with the infected individual to ensure they receive any necessary medical attention.

The HSE and University will now take all appropriate steps to contain any further spread of the virus and protect your welfare and the welfare of the University community.¬†


The relevant part of the University (Floor 4 of the Trinity Biomedical Sciences Institute), and the lifts in TBSI, have been closed as a precautionary measure and will be cleaned in accordance with HSE guidelines.¬†


The rest of the University is open and operating as normal. However, the situation remains fluid and you should check your emails regularly as well as the latest official advice from the HSE and other statutory bodies.


Further information about COVID-19 in Trinity with useful links to other organisations can be found at¬†www.tcd.ie/about/coronavirus/

Your question and confusion is easy to understand, because when all you hear are scary headlines shouting about a ""deadly pandemic"" it's easy to assume that the illness is only severe.

It's a serious disservice that our media have done, perpetrating that perception, because *that's why this thing is spreading so rampantly*. Because people who are only mildly ill think, ""Oh I just have a cold. I couldn't possibly have that Coronavirus thing. I'm not that sick.""

Except that 80% of people who get this thing don't get that sick. They get mild symptoms only and some people (especially children) get no symptoms at all.

*What are those mild symptoms?*

Primarily fever and cough. And this is very important!! This thing DOES NOT present with a sore throat and runny nose in most cases. Doctors are actually using that information to help with diagnosis and recommendation for testing.

If you get a fever of any kind whatsoever or if you get any kind of coughing, *please stay home*. Call your doctor and ask if you can be tested for Covid-19 before you leave your house to go to any public place, including work.

You will most likely be fine, but if you leave your house, you will be endangering people like me, on strong maintenance immune suppressants for an autoimmune condition.

The people who scare me the most are the ones who think, ""Oh I'm not that sick. I couldn't possibly have Coronavirus."" Those people are the reason I'm officially isolating myself in my house starting this weekend, until the first wave of this thing blows over.

And clarification on the pneumonia confusion: Pneumonia just means a lung infection. If you have Covid at all, technically you have pneumonia. But some people who get pneumonia will experience a build up of fluid, pus, and mucus in their lungs that can obstruct the ability of the lungs to exchange oxygen and carbon dioxide to the point that it becomes life-threatening. Those are more colloquially what people are talking about when they used the word pneumonia. But medically, pneumonia is any infection of the lung tissue."

2020-03-05,cisned,Coronavirus,8,https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/fe6ed6/australian_woman_tested_positive_again_after_she/fjmdmat/,"I‚Äôve done vaccine research at Duke for CMV and HIV.

CMV is a herpes virus, and like someone said, it‚Äôs a DNA virus. HIV is an RNA virus that kills immune cells. This coronavirus is an RNA virus capable of infecting like HIV and CMV. 

About 90% of the population has CMV, and it‚Äôs one of the most prevalent viruses. It‚Äôs not a problem unless you‚Äôre a newborn, or an immunocompromised patient. Coronavirus will be prevalent, but we don‚Äôt know what it does to the immune system. 

Some sources from China claim that it reduces lymphocytes during infection. When lymphocytes reach a low number, it causes respiratory and/or multiple organ failure leading to death. HIV does the same, it attacks lymphocytes and allows a secondary infection that leads into death. 

HIV also hides in the body and causes reinfection when the body is in distress or vulnerable. It can‚Äôt be cured because it mutates constantly, and the antibodies needed are rare to make, while also being autoimmune.

This virus shows signs of reinfection, as there are multiple cases where discharged patients come back with Conv-19. Its been claimed by scientific sources that there are two strains, and both can infect you at the same time. HIV does the same, and it has multiple strains, 3 major ones, that can infect you at once.

As far as I can tell, this virus has everything. It can even infect you while being asymptomatic. Something HIV, Hep-B/C only have. We don‚Äôt know what the long term effects of coronavirus are, but if I had to guess it will be like HIV.

The body and immune system will be scarred, and constantly attacked by reinfection. The scarred tissue in the lungs will cause low oxygen saturation in the blood. This will lead into a chronic illness, possibly causing early cardiac arrest.

The virus will not be able to be cured, but rather treated. Eventually something like this will need a vaccine, but we will also need to get a bit lucky. The first step of the vaccine is to find an antigen to give universally. The problem is that some people don‚Äôt react to the antigen accordingly, or simply don‚Äôt have the genes to form the required antibodies, something that occurs with HIV. Not only that, but that antigens must also be effective against multiple strains and in multiple cells lines. Something that we also have problems with herpes and HIV.

As a biochemist turned immunologist/virologist I‚Äôm not optimistic. I believe it‚Äôs going to be challenging, but if we overcome this, we will get better. If we can cure this virus, we‚Äôll be able to tackle many other viruses. The field will advance, and eventually CRISPR technology will be used.

Unfortunately with vaccine research you always run into the same problem. How do you fix a genetic mutation without modifying its genome if you can‚Äôt do genetic experiments?"

For those getting hit with the paywall:

Coronavirus has mutated into two strains, one which appears to be far more aggressive,[ scientists have said](https://academic.oup.com/nsr/advance-article/doi/10.1093/nsr/nwaa036/5775463), in a discovery which could hinder attempts to develop a vaccine.

Researchers at Peking University's School of Life Sciences and the  Institut Pasteur of Shanghai, discovered the virus has evolved into two  major lineages - dubbed ‚ÄòL‚Äô and ‚ÄòS‚Äô types.

The older ‚ÄòS-type‚Äô appears to be milder and less infectious, while  the ‚ÄòL-type‚Äô which emerged later, spreads quickly and currently accounts  for around 70 per cent of cases.¬†

Genetic analysis of a man in the US who tested positive on January  21, also showed it is possible to be infected with both types.

The finding comes just days after government health experts warned that the virus could hit Britain in ‚Äò[multiple waves](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2020/03/03/governments-coronavirus-action-plan-detail/)‚Äô, and led to fears that some vaccines might not work on mutated strains.

Dr Stephen Griffin, of the [Leeds Institute of Medical Research](https://medicinehealth.leeds.ac.uk/homepage/160/leeds_institute_of_medical_research_at_st_jamess)  and chair of the virus division at the Microbiology Society, said that  two of the changes between the ‚ÄòS‚Äô and ‚ÄòL‚Äô lineages were in crucial  protein called ‚Äòspike‚Äô, which plays a key role in the infection process  and is a target for vaccines.

Dr Griffin said developers would need to test whether their prototype  vaccines would still neutralise viruses with the changes, but added  that the variations were ‚Äòfairly limited‚Äô and may not be a ‚Äòhuge  hurdle.‚Äô

‚ÄúIt is usually the case that when RNA viruses first cross species  barriers into humans they aren‚Äôt particularly well adapted to their new  host - us!‚Äù said Dr Griffin.

‚ÄúThus, they usually undergo some changes allowing them to adapt and  become better able to replicate within, and spread from  human-to-human.‚Äù¬†

 [UK Coronavirus confirmed cases map](https://cf-particle-html.eip.telegraph.co.uk/bbaaf42c-ed56-4a8b-975a-be7c232640b9.html)   

Some 35 laboratories and institutions are racing to [develop a vaccine ](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/science/2020/03/03/will-have-coronavirus-vaccine-human-trials-begin-april/)with  several ready to move to human trials within the next month. But a wide  scale inoculation is unlikely to be rolled out before next year.

Virologist Professor Jonathan Ball also warned that mutations could  affect vaccine production, but said that the Chinese results needed  replication with a larger study.¬†

‚ÄúAt the moment we don't have hard evidence that the virus has changes  with regards to disease severity or infectivity so we need to be  cautious when interpreting these kinds of computer-based studies,  interesting as they might be,‚Äù he added.

The Chinese scientists, who analysed the viral DNA from 103 infected  people, said it appeared the less dangerous ‚ÄòS-type‚Äô was now taking  over, possibly because of aggressive public health lockdown measures in  China, which had stopped the more virulent disease in its tracks.

However Dr Bharat Pankhania, Senior Clinical Lecturer at the [University of Exeter Medical School](https://medicine.exeter.ac.uk/), said it was impossible to know what was causing the slowdown.

‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt really know the true picture in China,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúIs the  lower number of cases a true reflection? It could be the virus mutating  to a less dangerous form, or it could be the superhuman lockdown  measures.¬†

‚ÄúOr there could be a third reason which is genetic drift. RNA viruses  are quite mistake-prone so over time they become not very good at  replicating.‚Äù

New mutations were also discovered in the case of a 61-year-old man  from Brazil, although Dr David Heyman of the London School of Hygiene  and Tropical Medicine said a vaccine should still work on the emerging  strain.¬†

‚ÄúNothing has occurred that is major and this virus appears to be stable,‚Äù he said.

‚ÄúSmall mutations are normal, especially with RNA viruses. We look for the parts of the virus that are most sustained.‚Äù

This week the government set out its battle plan to combat the  outbreak, warning that in a worst-case scenario, 80 per cent of the  population could become infected, with a relatively high death rate  among the elderly and frail.

Government scientific experts predict the outbreak could last around  four to six months. The government's Chief Medical Officer (CMO)¬†  Professor Chris Whitty said he believed there was now onward  transmission between people in the UK - which could lead to spiralling  numbers - although it is unclear which variant is spreading in Britain.

Prof Witty said Britain was unlikely to follow China‚Äôs example of  shutting down cities, because the virus has already spread too far.

‚ÄúClosing cities is really only appropriate if you have a significant  epidemic in one particular place and almost nothing anywhere else,‚Äù he  said.

‚ÄúIt made sense for China to respond in the way it did but it would be  very unlikely here... This is now in multiple places in Europe and  around the world.‚Äù

There are now more than 90,000 cases worldwide with more than 3,000 deaths.

The new findings were published in the [National Science Review](https://academic.oup.com/nsr/advance-article/doi/10.1093/nsr/nwaa036/5775463), the journal of the Chinese Academy of Sciences."

Compare that to, let say, Germany, nearly 500 cases for 80M inhabitants, way less direct exchanges with China, took better measures from the start, fought initially every reported case by chasing chains of contagion, good health and testing access for any citizen‚Ä¶

If we go south of S&P 2850 (current bottom from last week), who knows where we end up.

S&P going all the way down to 2500-2600 is reasonable in a massive selloff if coronavirus worries get worse and we start to see unemployment increase or real recession indicators flash red.

The timeline is probably something like 6-12 weeks.  We'd have to see uncontained outbreaks and massive economic disruption (stuff on the level of major cities and Disney World being shut down for weeks).

Note that you'd still see 3-4% up days here and there even if the market declines further.  Volatility increasing means you'd just see more down days than up days but the up days would be as large."

The instinct of people to want mortality rates is so that they can compare disease to disease.  But those other diseases aren't measured in deaths / ( deaths + recoveries ).

Instead, flu, etc, have data that incorporates the modeled number of infections based on statistical sampling and knowledge of flu spread that's been built over decades.  They are able to build numbers for its mortality over the field of all (quite accurately) estimated infections of the flu in a season.  And that's why it's a much lower number.

If you were to compare mortality of coronavirus cases which required hospitalization for supportive care versus mortality of flu cases which required hospitalization for supportive care, I believe those numbers are a lot closer together than the .1% versus 3.4%."

The traffic jam is pushing up transportation prices for U.S. exporters and sowing turmoil on the heels of a painful trade war.

Normally there are about 200 sailings of container ships across the Pacific a month.

That means fewer ships are available to make the return journey east, and the normal turnover of containers has stalled.

‚ÄúRight now empty \[refrigerated\] containers are in short supply,‚Äù said Peter Friedmann, executive director of the Agriculture Transportation Coalition, a trade group for exporters. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs harder to get on a vessel, and there‚Äôs not enough outbound capacity to handle all the cargo seeking bookings, particularly to China.‚Äù

It‚Äôs the height of California‚Äôs orange-growing season, but truckers for Fast Way Xpress Inc., who haul oranges and other produce from the Central Valley to the port of Oakland, have waited in line there for empty refrigerated containers for up to four hours. By the time the drivers reach the shipping terminal, they sometimes then discover all the containers are gone.

‚ÄúThe lines are so long it looks like the L.A. freeway,‚Äù said Carleton Booker, the company‚Äôs director of sales and operations.

The number of idled container ships in the Pacific region has reached 370, compared with about 230 at the beginning of the year, according to Jonathan Roach, an analyst at Braemar ACM Shipbroking. He said that, in addition to canceled sailings due to trade disruptions, about 100 of the ships have been pulled out of service to retrofit their exhaust systems to comply with new regulations.

And with the resoruces for many professors to teach online, many are upset we can't even really get that.

I agree. My greatest fear for the virus isn't my self but the weaker members of my family

Also fun fact: it has mutated! There is evidence to say that there is at least two distinct strains of the coronavirus running around.  Nothing super serious except one seems to be more virulent that the other - take that as you will"

40% (including 25% of severe cases) has normal CXRs. Similar numbers for CRP.

Religious schools have been shut.

Some festivities for the Jewish holiday of Purim are up in the air.

And officials in Westchester County, N.Y., estimate 1,000 people are quarantined at home after a well-attended bat mitzvah and funeral.

The case of a seriously ill father with deep roots in a modern Orthodox community shows [how quickly coronavirus can spread](https://www.wsj.com/articles/coronavirus-spreads-in-washington-state-as-amazon-worker-tests-positive-11583318127?mod=article_inline) in circles that live, go to school and attend services together. As of Thursday, [officials said 18 people in Westchester had been diagnosed with Covid-19](https://www.wsj.com/articles/six-new-yorkers-including-four-family-members-have-coronavirus-11583338997?mod=article_inline), and all those cases were tied to contact with that man.

Rabbis said the connectedness of their community is a great strength, but when a contagious illness strikes, the vast network of links among families can make it especially hard to control infection.

&#x200B;

 

‚ÄúWhen you‚Äôre in a tightknit kind of society, there‚Äôs lots of opportunities for interaction,‚Äù said Rabbi Yonah Berman at YCT Rabbinical School, in the Bronx‚Äôs Riverdale section, which has been affected. ‚ÄúWhen people are told to step back from that interaction, that‚Äôs harder than it would be in communities where individuals keep more to themselves.‚Äù

Rabbis throughout the New York City area are adjusting the customs of a traditional Jewish culture as they tried to halt the escalation of illness.

&#x200B;

 

They sent congregations a range of warnings: Please don‚Äôt kiss the Torah or mezuzah, a small scroll in a case attached to the doorway of many homes. Please don‚Äôt come to services or ritual baths if you feel any symptoms. And please don‚Äôt reach out to shake hands lest someone feel obliged to reciprocate.

A Westchester attorney became the second person in New York to test positive for the novel coronavirus on Tuesday. His wife, son and daughter were diagnosed with it as well, state officials said. Only the attorney is hospitalized in serious condition. His family is in quarantine at home in New Rochelle. A neighbor and friends‚Äîfive people in a local family‚Äîalso tested positive for the virus, officials said.

As of Thursday, a total of 22 people in New York had the virus, according to state officials.

After the attorney was diagnosed, his synagogue, Young Israel of New Rochelle, said it was halting services through Sunday because of potential exposure tied to him. Further, county health officials said people who attended services there on Feb. 22, and a funeral and a bat mitzvah on Feb. 23, must self-quarantine until at least Sunday.

Samuel Heilman, a Queens College professor of sociology quarantined after going to the Feb. 23 funeral, said hundreds of mourners attended the funeral because it was for a founder of the synagogue.

Many congregants ‚Äúare neighbors and friends, and live within walking distance,‚Äù he said, and after weekly religious services they have a reception. ‚ÄúEveryone is eating at the same time, talking and touching each other,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúAll of those things can increase the likelihood of transfer.‚Äù

Westchester County officials alerted residents about these quarantine rules quickly through email blasts, social media, rabbis and school leaders.

State and county officials said they were working together to identify the universe of people who might have been exposed to individuals known to have coronavirus.

This is the first instance of community spread in New York. Gov. Andrew Cuomo said that such a case could have happened anywhere‚Äî‚Äúand it will.‚Äù

The governor called the case ‚Äúone of the more complicated situations that we‚Äôve come across because of the number of interconnections that this family has presented.‚Äù

Each infected person is being investigated in an attempt to limit the number of additional infections. The governor said people in self-isolation are being contacted by the county, state, schools or other private organizations.

&#x200B;

 

The school attended by the daughter of the attorney, SAR High School, said it would remain closed until Wednesday, and its lower school, SAR Academy, will reopen Monday. Some classes were held online.

Yeshiva University, where the attorney‚Äôs son is a student, has canceled classes and events until after March 10.

Rabbi Reuven Fink of Young Israel of New Rochelle said in an email to his congregation that obeying the quarantine order is a ‚Äúsacred obligation.‚Äù

The rabbi explained practices that could shift. For example, he said people who need to say Kaddish, a mourner‚Äôs prayer by a quorum of 10 men, could do it after the quarantine is lifted.

Hundreds of thousands of Orthodox Jews lived in New York City, Westchester and Long Island‚Äôs Suffolk and Nassau counties, according to experts.

Many travel for events. The Jewish Educational Center in Elizabeth, N.J., alerted families Wednesday night that some students who attended the New Rochelle bat mitzvah last month were in self-quarantine, and none had shown signs of illness.

Three sisters were sent home Wednesday from Bnos Yisroel of Baltimore, a private school, because they went to a March 1 bas mitzvah in White Plains, N.Y., attended by one of the New Rochelle residents who tested positive, school officials said. They said the girls showed no symptoms and are in quarantine.

The virus hit shortly before Purim, a holiday commemorating the salvation of the Jewish people in ancient Persia. It will be celebrated next week, on Monday night and Tuesday, when families often visit dozens of homes to drop off gifts of food. Several rabbis suggested families scale back such plans.

Rabbi Mark Dratch, executive vice president of the Rabbinical Council of America, the umbrella group for modern Orthodox rabbis, said rabbis planned a conference call Thursday to discuss how congregants who might still be under quarantine could hear the traditional Purim reading of the scroll of Esther on Monday, perhaps by telephone or video hookup.

‚ÄúPeople may be uncomfortable because it‚Äôs not typical, but because of the emergency nature of the situation, they may have to take advantage of it,‚Äù Mr. Dratch said. Such high-tech alternatives wouldn‚Äôt work, however, for services on the Sabbath from dusk Friday through Saturday, when Orthodox Jews are barred from using technology, he said.

The Mikvah of New Rochelle, a facility offering ritual baths, closed Tuesday night and remained shut Wednesday. In New Jersey‚Äôs Bergen County, the Teaneck Mikvah Association asked clients feeling flulike symptoms to get clearance from their doctors before coming. Orthodox women are supposed to use such ritual baths after they finish their monthly period and before they can have intimate contact with their husbands.

Members of Young Israel of New Rochelle said they were praying for the families that fell ill. Janet Waller, who is in quarantine, said more than 40 women were following a tradition of baking challah bread and saying a blessing of healing.

‚ÄúOur community is coming together, and people are praying very, very hard,‚Äù she said."

My mom is South Korean and told me a story she heard in the news (we both live in America, but she watches the South Korean news).  As you know, many older people have issues with technology or mobility and as a result, aren't able to get masks since they announce where masks are on the internet.  The young people buy masks and drop them off at senior centers since the older people need it more.  She also told me that so many people are volunteering to go to Daegu that they don't have enough openings for everyone who wants to go.   


Yeah, those are feel good stories you'd hear in the news, but at the same time it's a very Korean thing.  South Koreans have spent generations digging themselves out of grinding poverty and sacrificing for future generations.  That is how they become so successful economically.  I think it is is this Confucian mentality that will help them be successful in fighting Coronavirus and that the younger generations will see that its their time to fight for the old.  When push comes to shove, people will put themselves on the line to save the collective whole.   This is something that i don't think we are going to see in the West."

‚ÄúThe LabCorp 2019 Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19), NAA test was developed internally by LabCorp and is being made available pursuant to guidance issued by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). LabCorp‚Äôs test has been validated for use with respiratory samples, including nasopharyngeal (NP) or oropharyngeal (OP) aspirates or washes, NP or OP swabs, and broncheoalveolar lavage (BAL). The test is a qualitative assay using PCR technology, which LabCorp played a central role in commercializing when PCR was introduced nearly 30 years ago.


LabCorp does not currently collect specimens for the test. Patients for whom testing has been ordered should not be sent to a LabCorp location to have a specimen collected. Instead, an appropriate specimen should be collected at the healthcare facility where the patient was seen and the test was ordered. The specimen should be sent to LabCorp using standard procedures. Test results will be available in 3-4 days. More information about the test, including specimen collection and packaging requirements, is available here: https://www.labcorp.com/tests/139900/2019-novel-coronavirus-covid-19-naa‚Äù

Felt like I should include that as well, you have to get the testing done AT YOUR DOCTORS OFFICE AND THEN THE DOCTOR SENDS THE SAMPLE TO LABCORP FOR TESTING. So if you are feeling symptoms, DO NOT COME TO LABCORP. The phlebotomists are not trained to work with suspected coronavirus patients."

The White House on Wednesday also benched Azar from a coronavirus task force press briefing, the latest sign of diminished standing for an official who was the face of the U.S. response just a week ago.

Four of Azar‚Äôs deputies ‚Äî including Medicare chief Seema Verma and Food and Drug Administration Commissioner Steve Hahn, who were both added to the task force after Pence took over the federal response ‚Äî joined the vice president and other officials at the White House on Wednesday.

Azar's absence didn't go unnoticed by allies worried about his standing in the administration and the way he's catching more flak for missteps. Azar was front and center Thursday at a Capitol Hill briefing with House members, during which he took heat from some lawmakers over transparency and whether his department is adequately prepared for the stealthy disease.

Asked why Azar didn‚Äôt attend Wednesday's televised briefing, a Pence spokesperson said that Azar left for his office after the task force meeting, and officials wanted to make room on stage for Ben Carson, the Housing and Urban Development secretary and also a task force member. A spokesperson for Azar said that members of the task force will be ‚Äúrotating through as necessary‚Äù now that the group is doing daily briefings."

Current test doesn't distinguish between them, this study used DNA sequencing not just RT-PCR.  One patient tested positive for both viruses.

Entirely possible that someone ""had coronavirus"" (the milder S strain), got sick, went to the makeshift hospital (likely lacking adequate cross-contamination equipment), started getting better but picked up the OTHER coronavirus (nasty L-strain), and then died from the L after getting kicked around by the S beforehand.

Bottom line is to not assume anything about a novel disease, avoid hospital unless you absolutely need oxygen, and stay home until a few weeks after the symptoms are gone so that you know your immune system has totally recovered."

A few months ago they had Susan Rice on to talk about her life. 20% was about her life, the rest was about how she felt about Trump. It was annoying because we all know  how she feels about Trump but she has a very interesting life.

>As a cruise ship carrying some 2,500 passengers who may have been exposed to coronavirus reaches the coast near San Francisco Thursday, officials are also trying to track down passengers of a previous ‚ÄúMexican Riviera‚Äù cruise aboard the same vessel, the Grand Princess, where three passengers later tested positive for the virus and one has since died. 

Looks like the ship went for 10 days around Mexico (which is when the woman from Calgary was on it), returning to San Fran on Feb 21.  The ship then re-loaded on passengers (2000+ people) for a 15 night cruise to hawaii.  This second cruise is the one not being allowed to dock.  A couple other people from the first cruise have now come forward with the virus (including a death) so the second cruise turned around and returned to San Fran yesterday, and around 100 people onboard are showing symptoms."

Conspiracy theorists blame U.S. for coronavirus. China is happy to encourage them.

BEIJING ‚Äî The United States is concealing the true scale of its coronavirus deaths. The United States should learn from China about how to respond to an epidemic. The United States was the origin of the coronavirus ‚Äî and the global crisis was never China's fault.

Welcome to the Chinese Internet this week.

As new coronavirus cases and the sense of panic¬†ebb in China, the country that was first struck by the disease has been gripped by a wave of nationalist pride, conspiracy theories and a perennial mix of anti-American sentiments: suspicion, superiority, schadenfreude.

Weeks after China‚Äôs government came under scrutiny over whether¬†its mismanagement¬†unleashed the coronavirus on the world, officials in Beijing and many ordinary Chinese appear relieved ‚Äî even happy ‚Äî to turn the tables and call out missteps in Italy, South Korea and, particularly, a Trump administration that has been¬†roiled by a chaotic response¬†to the gathering crisis.

In recent days, run-of-the-mill mockery of the White House has taken a darker turn as the Chinese Internet became inundated by the theory, subtly stoked by the Chinese government, that the coronavirus originated in the United States. The U.S. government, one version of the theory goes, has been covering up mounting cases, and perhaps thousands of deaths, by classifying them as regular flu.

While conspiracy theories pervade the Internet in every country, the sudden surge and overwhelming prevalence of anti-U.S. rhetoric this week has been conspicuous and significant in the context of China, where censors typically scrub speech that strays out of bounds and police¬†quickly detain¬†those deemed to be spreading rumors.

Coronavirus spread from China. Now, China doesn‚Äôt want the world spreading it back.

‚ÄúGo on WeChat, go on Weibo, look on Baidu search, and it‚Äôs full of ‚Äòlook at all the other countries getting sick,‚Äô or ‚Äòthe virus came from the United States,‚Äô or all different levels of conspiracy theories,‚Äù said¬†Xiao Qiang, an adjunct professor at the University of California at Berkeley‚Äôs School of Information who studies China‚Äôs Internet.

AD

Fringe theories, to be sure, have been widely floated on both sides of the Pacific.

Sen. Tom Cotton (R-Ark.) speculated last month on Fox News that the virus may have escaped from a Wuhan lab that researched dangerous pathogens, repeating a popular theory that had been debunked by scientists.

Some observers of Chinese politics say the crescendo of anti-American sentiment may be a product of organic nationalism or overactive imaginations of millions of Chinese cooped up at home. But Xiao said it was no coincidence that social media ‚Äî the source of news for most Chinese ‚Äî was awash in anti-American discourse precisely at a moment when the image of the Communist Party and its leader Xi Jinping has been¬†badly dented¬†after Chinese officials were found to be covering up early information about the outbreak.

AD

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs more than just some disinformation or an official narrative,‚Äù said Xiao, the founder of¬†China Digital Times, a website that regularly publishes leaked directives from the party‚Äôs propaganda department. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs an orchestrated, all-out campaign by the Chinese government through every channel at a level you rarely see. It‚Äôs a counteroffensive.‚Äù

A review of Chinese social media and state media over recent days shows how the anti-American theories gained steam through a mix of unexplained official statements magnified by social media, censorship and doubts stoked by state media and government officials.

The frenzy kicked into overdrive Feb. 27 after Zhong Nanshan, a Chinese pulmonologist who has appeared on state media to deliver key pronouncements, made a passing remark during a news conference, without offering any explanation, that ‚Äúthe coronavirus first appeared in China but may not have originated in China.‚Äù

AD

Zhong‚Äôs comments were dismissed as unfounded by the reputable Shanghai public health official Zhang Wenhong, yet Zhang‚Äôs remarks were quickly censored. Zhong later tried to clarify his comments, but by then, nationalistic social media accounts and state media had pounced.

State outlets began producing headlines that cast doubt on China‚Äôs role in unleashing the virus. China Global Television News, the overseas arm of the state broadcaster, uploaded a¬†two-minute clip¬†of Zhong‚Äôs remarks to YouTube, garnering tens of thousands of views.

Coronavirus tests Xi‚Äôs ‚Äòheavenly mandate,‚Äô but proves a godsend for his surveillance state

The rumor mill ramped up. Influential Weibo accounts such as ‚ÄúBeijing Things‚Äù circulated a¬†Taiwanese television clip¬†showing a pharmacologist speculating about the United States as the contagion‚Äôs origin. Writers at popular outlets on WeChat churned out theses laying out how the U.S. military could have deployed the pathogen as a clandestine bioweapon during a trip to Wuhan in October.

On Saturday, the New York-based College Daily, a popular WeChat account for Chinese students studying abroad that toes a nationalistic line, wondered in a headline: ‚ÄúIf it‚Äôs true that the virus originated in the United States, should China still apologize to the world?‚Äù

When the widely followed blogger Heiheig asked in a poll that day whether readers thought U.S. government data on flu cases was suspicious, 91 percent of his 116,000 respondents saw something fishy in U.S.-reported numbers.

‚ÄúThey can‚Äôt cure covid-19¬†so they‚Äôre trying to pin it on China!‚Äù said one typical response. Others mocked the United States for not being able to produce as many as masks as China.

AD

By Wednesday, Zhong‚Äôs comments came full circle. Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian did not speculate as to the virus‚Äôs origin or name any countries, but he cited Zhong‚Äôs comments to conclude that China was never proven to be the origin.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs extremely irresponsible of some media to call the new coronavirus ‚ÄòChinese virus,‚Äô and we firmly oppose it,‚Äù Zhao told reporters at a daily briefing. ‚ÄúWe have to work together to oppose the ‚Äòinformation virus‚Äô and ‚Äòpolitical virus.‚Äô‚Äù

The same day, the state-run Xinhua News Agency republished an essay that suggested the virus originated elsewhere and that called for American officials and journalists to apologize.

Dali Yang, an expert on Chinese politics at the University of Chicago, said he was not convinced that the outpouring of anti-U.S. rhetoric was wholly due to a sophisticated state disinformation campaign. But the flood of posts and essays, many seemingly written by authentic users, aligned neatly with the government narrative that casts doubt on China‚Äôs culpability, he said.

‚ÄúThe purpose is to lessen the focus on how China bungled its response,‚Äù said Yang. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a kind of blame-shifting.‚Äù

Chinese suspicions and criticisms have not only been trained on the United States or sinister theories. Online posts have widely panned other governments, from Italy to Japan.

Bill Bishop, an observer of Chinese politics who¬†writes the Sinocism¬†newsletter, said the narrative of Communist Party superiority is being systematically ‚Äî and effectively ‚Äî pushed. After Hong Kong‚Äôs¬†pro-democracy protests, party leaders resolved in November to double down on propaganda and¬†patriotic education¬†that would tout the advantages of the party‚Äôs efficient, authoritarian leadership over chaotic, Western-style democracy, Bishop said.

AD

That argument is gaining traction, Bishop said, adding that his mother-in-law in China has been urging his family to flee their home in Washington for the safety of China.

‚ÄúShe is convincing us that China has won the virus battle and the U.S. is about to descend into chaos,‚Äù he said.

It‚Äôs unclear how far the rhetoric bashing other countries will go. Many Chinese are expressing dismay at others‚Äô online behavior.

An editorial writer at the state-owned China Youth Daily, Cao Lin,¬†wrote¬†that it was ‚Äúrepulsive‚Äù to see Chinese ‚Äúgloating over misfortune‚Äù and ‚Äúdemonizing‚Äù other countries as the epidemic goes worldwide.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs belittling other people‚Äôs anti-virus efforts to feed or pander to your own sense of vanity,‚Äù Cao wrote.

But unlike Cao, others have been quickly silenced for rebuking their compatriots.

Wang Xiaolei, a former state media journalist and popular WeChat essayist, urged Chinese to stop blaming other countries and shoulder some responsibility.

Without referencing the virus, Wang used a lengthy metaphor that compared China with tenants whose apartment floods ‚Äî and then blame their downstairs neighbor.

‚ÄúBe a person with a healthy psychology and repair your floor,‚Äù Wang wrote in an essay that was criticized by influential state media officials including¬†Hu Xijin, the editor of the Global Times newspaper, after it was published Friday.

By Sunday, Wang‚Äôs essay was censored and had vanished from China‚Äôs Internet."

> There‚Äôs this big panic in the West over asymptomatic cases. Many people are asymptomatic when tested, but develop symptoms within a day or two.

> In Guangdong, they went back and retested 320,000 samples originally taken for influenza surveillance and other screening.

A lot of the people in this thread are ignorant. Coronavirus spreads by droplet transmission. And while it is true that putting a mask on the patient will limit the spread more effectively than putting masks on healthy people; both represent barriers to transmission.

>**Healthcare personnel wear a mask (a respirator is not necessary) for close contact with infectious patient**

https://www.cdc.gov/infectioncontrol/guidelines/isolation/precautions.html

> Droplet Precautions ‚Äì Surgical masks within 3 feet of patient

https://www.cdc.gov/hai/pdfs/ppe/ppeslides6-29-04.pdf

>You and the patient should wear a facemask if you are in the same room.

>Wear a disposable facemask and gloves when you touch or have contact with the patient‚Äôs blood, stool, or body fluids, such as saliva, sputum, nasal mucus, vomit, urine. 

https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/guidance-prevent-spread.html

The reason why the CDC says this:

>CDC does not recommend that people who are well wear a facemask to protect themselves from respiratory diseases, including COVID-19.

Is not because they don't work as people in this thread seem to believe. Its because:

>The use of facemasks is also crucial for health workers and people who are taking care of someone in close settings (at home or in a health care facility).

https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/about/prevention-treatment.html

And we do not have enough masks in the USA right now. By buying masks you are prioritizing your own life over the lives of the people in your community, as well as the ability of healthcare professionals to do their jobs safely. Masks should not be used by the average person because there are limited supplies so we need to use the masks we do have strategically.

>‚ÄúSeriously people,‚Äù the surgeon general said on Twitter, warning that a run on the masks could risk a shortage harmful to public health professionals.

and
