He's a pilot and has flown to Asia (not sure where) within the last 14 days.  I knew he wasn't feeling well, but I guess his symptoms must be fairly bad if they met the CDC guidelines for testing.  

My parents are terrible about keeping me up to date when it comes to their health.  I've found out about fairly significant surgeries after they happened, and it's like pulling teeth to get them to tell me how they're doing.  Now my dad has symptoms that warrant coronavirus testing (from what I can read, the standard is symptoms that require hospitalization), and I'm only informed when I get a selfie of him at a hospital. 

I'm trying not to freak out since the odds are that he doesn't have it, but it's still pretty scary. Especially so considering they live with my 80-something-year-old grandpa and my pregnant sister was staying with them the last few days.

*Update*: The motivation for the test was that he was showing symptoms, had a test for influenza which came up negative, and had traveled to one of the countries on the list.

*Update 2*: So he has not actually been tested yet.  They've run (or are running) other tests.  He may or may not be quarantined. Or he may have to stay at the hospital.  I don't know... like I said, pulling teeth."

Two. It’s not that coronavirus is more infectious than the flu, but that there is no vaccination for it and no previous exposure, which would increase one’s immunity.

Three. Another protective thing to do is to simply take care of yourself. Eat a healthy diet, drink plenty of water, and don’t let yourself become sleep deprived by staying out till the wee hours.

Full text for anyone paywalled

>Iran’s deputy health minister, Iraj Harirchi, was pale and drenched in sweat during a press conference on Monday as he told reporters that the Islamic Republic had “almost stabilized” the country’s outbreak of coronavirus. He mopped his brow so often that an aide scurried to the lectern with a box of tissues. Harirchi dismissed as hype an Iranian lawmaker’s claim that fifty people had already died from COVID-19. “I will resign if the numbers are even half or a quarter of this,” he said, adding that Iran had only sixty-one confirmed cases, with twelve deaths. Iran opposed quarantines, he said, because they belonged to an era before the First World War—“to the plague, cholera, stuff like that.” The next day, Harirchi confirmed in a video—from quarantine—that he had contracted coronavirus.

>Iran, a country of eighty-three million people, has now become one of the global epicenters of the coronavirus—with the highest mortality rate in the world. Based on official numbers, the mortality rate in Iran has fluctuated daily, between eight and eighteen per cent, compared to three per cent in China and less everywhere else. Iran is also unique, because a disproportionate number of confirmed cases are senior government officials. On Thursday, the Vice-President, Masoumeh Ebtekar—who gained fame in 1979 as Sister Mary, the spokeswoman for the students who seized the U.S. Embassy and took fifty-two Americans hostage—announced that she, too, had contracted the coronavirus. The day before, she had attended a meeting with President Hassan Rouhani and his cabinet. Two members of parliament, including the chairman of the Committee on National Security and Foreign Policy, have also been infected, as has the mayor of a district in Tehran and a senior cleric who had served as Iran’s Ambassador to the Vatican. One of the lawmakers, Mahmoud Sadeghi, tweeted on Tuesday, “I send this message in a situation where I have little hope of surviving in this world.” The former Vatican Ambassador, who was eighty-one, died on Thursday. So did Elham Sheikhi, a member of the women’s national soccer team, who was twenty-two.

> Iran’s official counts—three hundred and eighty-eight confirmed cases and thirty-four deaths, as of Friday—may be grossly underreported. In an early analysis published on Monday, six Canadian epidemiologists calculated that Iran probably had more than eighteen thousand cases of coronavirus. Their mathematical model was based on Iran’s official death toll, the disease’s infection and mortality rates worldwide, inflections in other countries traced to Iran, flight data, and travel patterns. “Given the low volumes of air travel to countries with identified cases of COVID-19 with origin in Iran (such as Canada), it is likely that Iran is currently experiencing a COVID-19 epidemic of significant size,” they concluded. Because of the wide margin of error, the number of cases could range from as low as thirty-seven hundred to as high as fifty-three thousand. In the end, the Canadian epidemiologists settled on eighteen thousand three hundred, with a ninety-five-per-cent confidence rate. All of their estimates are many, many times higher than the figures that Iran has reported. Their model was published on medRxiv, which posts preliminary research that has not yet been peer-reviewed. 

>Kamiar Alaei, a widely recognized Iranian global health-policy expert who co-founded an innovative H.I.V. clinic in Tehran, also emphasized the tricky and still evolving mathematics of coronavirus contagion. “The mortality rate elsewhere is around one to two per cent, and three per cent in China,” Alaei, who is now a co-president of the Institute for International Health and Education, in Albany, told me. “Iran has announced thirty-four deaths, although some unofficial reports claim it is at least a hundred and thirty-four and even two hundred. So if the death rate is only one per cent, then the total number of cases would be between thirty-four hundred and ten thousand or even twenty thousand.”

>The outbreak appears to have started in Qom, the conservative city of Shiite seminaries run by leading ayatollahs, about two hours from Tehran. It is also home to the Fatima Masumeh shrine—famed for its giant gold dome and intricate blue tilework—which draws pilgrims from all over the world. (For its historic beauty, I visit the shrine complex whenever I go to Qom.) The first mention of the disease by the government was a report of two deaths in the city on February 19th. Initial reports indicate that the carrier of the virus may have been a merchant who travelled between Qom and Wuhan, in China, where COVID-19 is believed to have originated. The outbreak is estimated to have begun between three and six weeks ago, which would mean that the two Iranians who died could have been sick and infecting others for weeks.

>Within eight days of the first reported death in Iran, COVID-19 had spread to twenty-four of the country’s thirty-one provinces. The number of cases has roughly doubled daily since Tuesday. Instead of closing down public sites, a measure that public-health experts have taken in other countries, the head of the shrine in Qom called on pilgrims to keep coming. “We consider this holy shrine to be a place of healing. That means people should come here to heal from spiritual and physical diseases,” Mohammad Saeedi, who is also the representative of Iran’s Supreme Leader in Qom, said in a video. Cases traced back to Iran have been reported in Azerbaijan, Afghanistan, Bahrain, Canada, Georgia, Iraq, Kuwait, Lebanon, Oman, Pakistan, and the United Arab Emirates. Many of these cases have been linked specifically to visits to Qom.

The outbreak coincided with two major milestones—the anniversary of Iran’s revolution, on February 11th, and the parliamentary election, on February 21st. “The government didn’t want to acknowledge that they had a coronavirus outbreak because they feared it would impact participation in these two events,” he said. “So for weeks there was a huge silence.” Less than forty-three per cent of Iranian voters turned out for the election, the lowest rate of participation since the 1979 revolution. Both voters and poll workers were photographed wearing masks.

>“It was the political decision that led to this outbreak in Iran,” Alaei said. “It’s very unfortunate, as Iran has a very well-established infrastructure for the health system and well-educated doctors.” Alaei was imprisoned in 2008 for “communicating with the enemy,” running espionage rings, and trying to “launch a velvet revolution” against the government in Tehran. He spent thirty months in the notorious Evin Prison. He moved to the United States after his release.
The coronavirus is also becoming a new flashpoint between Iran and the United States. After the election, the Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, accused Iran’s enemies of exaggerating the threat of coronavirus to scare voters away from the polls. “This negative propaganda about the virus began a couple of months ago and grew larger ahead of the election,” he said. “Their media did not miss the tiniest opportunity for dissuading Iranian voters and resorting to the excuse of disease and the virus.” On Wednesday, the U.S. Secretary of State, Mike Pompeo, countered that Iran was lying about “vital details” of the spread of the virus.

>The timing of the epidemic is particularly dire for Iran’s economy. As part of President Trump’s “maximum-pressure campaign,” the U.S. reimposed economic sanctions on Iran—and any foreign company or country that does business with it—in November, 2018. Iran’s economy contracted more than nine per cent last year. Since the coronavirus outbreak began, ten days ago, eleven countries, including major trading partners such as Afghanistan, Iraq, and Turkey, have closed their borders to the Islamic Republic, according to Adnan Mazarei, an economist at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, in Washington. “The entire Middle East region could soon be affected by Iran’s role as an epicenter of this contagion,”
he wrote on Thursday. “The Middle East region will certainly be hit by a new round of downward pressure on oil prices on account of a decline in demand for oil by China and elsewhere,” he added. And China has accounted for a quarter of all Iranian trade.

>Internal commerce is also likely to take a hit on the eve of Nowruz, the Persian New Year, in three weeks. Nowruz is the country’s biggest holiday, and the ritual is to buy new clothes and toys—and to travel to the Caspian coast or other vacation spots to take a break from Iran’s mounting crises. The more that Nowruz celebrations are curtailed, the greater the danger for protests about the epidemic, global isolation, and unanticipated economic setbacks. Two waves of protests have challenged the regime since November.

>Iran took steps this week to check the contagion’s spread. In Tehran’s subways, cars were disinfected and snack shops were shut. In more than a dozen provinces, public venues—college campuses, schools, and cultural centers—were closed. Events drawing large audiences, including soccer games and movie screenings, were postponed. Friday prayers were cancelled in the twenty-four provinces where the virus has appeared. Schools across Iran will be closed for three days, as of Saturday. The Health Ministry has urged people not to shake hands and to avoid crowded places. Social media was filled with parodies—a video of young men on the street shaking their shoes with one another, to avoid shaking hands, and a barber cutting the hair of a customer, who was wearing a mask, with a razor attached to an extender pole. Yet the regime has been fighting the image of a nation crippled by an epidemic as much as it has been fighting the coronavirus itself. Speaking at a national headquarters established to deal with the virus, Rouhani said, “In schools, high schools, universities, and workplaces, everybody should pay attention to health recommendations. But we must all continue our work and activities, because it is one of the enemies’ plots to spread fear in our country and close down the country.”

>The ailing deputy health minister was more candid. “I’m saying this deep from my heart . . . take care of yourselves,” Harirchi said in a
video that he posted from quarantine. “This is a democratic virus, and it doesn’t distinguish between poor and rich, statesman and an ordinary citizen. It may infect a number of people.” In the Islamic Republic, that number may be frighteningly large."

**Blue** dotted line is the extrapolation from Feb 20, 2020  
**Green** dotted line is the daily extrapolation based on daily data.

Extrapolation is based on an infection rate of 1.5 and an incubation period of 6 days and a removal rate of 12 days.

Just a reminder that this is not a prediction. It is an extrapolation to help as a visual guide for gauging the spread of the disease.

That means the virus appears to be spreading among at least two separate populations, according to people who spoke on condition of anonymity because the information has not been released publicly.

AD

Two separate cases of community transmission likely means that there are others in the United States, said Jennifer Nuzzo, senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security.

“I think there’s a strong possibility that there’s local transmission going in California. In other words, the virus is spreading within California, and I think there’s a possibility other states are in the same boat. They just haven’t recognized that yet,” she said.

Little else is known about the case, including the person’s condition and how long the resident was in the community while infectious.

To date, the virus, which originated in Wuhan China, has sickened more than 83,000 people and killed nearly 3,000."

If Trump were just an idiot, I'd be less worried. However, he's an idiot who would rather bend/alter reality than admit that he's an idiot.

Comparing deaths to the flu to Corona at this stage is disingenuous- we’re anticipating an issue (which is likely but sure, not definite) and preparing for it so as to minimize its potential to become a pandemic. Corona is new and the flu is not. However we now have confirmed Corona in every continent and, if you get it, you’re about 20x more likely to die from it at this point. The real danger according to experts at the CDC, will most likely be next fall, as it should slow its spread in the warmer months.

1. **The  virus has a R rate of 2** To determine how easily the      virus spreads, scientists will need to calculate what's known as the      ""basic reproduction number, or R0 (pronounced R-nought.) This is an      estimate of the average number of people who catch the virus from a single infected person. A study published Jan. 29 in the New England Journal of      Medicine (NEJM) estimated an R0 value for the new coronavirus to be 2.2,      meaning each infected person has been spreading the virus to an average of      2.2 people. This is similar to previous estimates, which have placed the      R0 value between 2 and 3. (For comparison, SARS initially had an R0 of      around 3, before public health measures brought it down to less than 1.) [Source](https://www.livescience.com/new-china-coronavirus-faq.html)
2. **25%      of cases are severe |** Patients end up on ICU and      require medical assistance (oxygen, medication) [Source](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/02/03/nih-dr-anthony-fauci-25percent-of-china-coronavirus-cases-very-serious.html)
3. The fatality **rate of 2%, with Wuhan being 4.9%**       | SARS had 10% and Mers 34%, whereas flu is 0.05%. With SARS and      MERS, the virus essentially kills it’s host too quickly before it could spread further. [Source](https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/coronavirus-death-rate/)
4. We believe that this virus is deadly in it’s numbers. It simply overwhelms the healthcare system as many patients require medical assistance. This medical assistance may not be readily available (especially in developing countries), and the larger the amount of infected, the higher the chances one could pass away as there is no space in the hospital (see Wuhan for example).

However, it must be noted that this is mostly based on data that is provided by China. It might not be entirely correct. The fatality rate may be a lot lower, or a lot higher than reported. The same applies for R rate.

But, if one were to argue that this virus is not as big of an issue, then why did the Chinese government lockdown their cities and implemented other measures to curb this virus?"

- A few days worth of drinking water and/or water purification supplies  

- two weeks worth of shelf stable food, importantly this should be things you will eat anyway over time, not specifically disaster rations. Stuff like extra jars of peanut butter, canned beans and veggies, etc.

- full stocks of cleaning supplies including bleach, even if you don’t use it regularly it’s good to have a fresh bottle around for killing bacteria and viruses on surfaces in an emergency situation. Also two weeks worth of toilet paper, I like to keep more than that on hand myself but I have space.

- basic first aid supplies and OTC meds. Pain relievers, allergy meds, whatever might make you need to run out to the drug store if someone gets sick from something normal, it’s worth it to have on hand already so you’re not tempted to go out in a disaster scenario. 

None of this is coronavirus specific, and it won’t result in empty shelves if you choose to stock up now. It will come in handy if things go badly, and help your community by removing you from the pool of people who need immediate assistance in a quarantine, but if things are okay you’ll still get use out of it eventually."

Anyway, just expressing my gut reaction was that this is going to get so much worse than we know right now. His response surprised me and infuriated me at the same time. His assessment was, paraphrasing:

""I don't know what to believe about it. It looks bad, but there's so much fake news out there and everyone has an agenda. There's people who want to make it look worse than it is because of the election. But the Republicans also want to play it down so they can win. There's not any good news you can believe.""

Like I said, infuriating because of the whole ""fake news"" blanket over everything. But that little sliver of seeing through the Trump/Republicans bullshit was a little, little glimmer of hope.

>""These claims simply do not reflect our business performance and consumer sentiment, which includes feedback from our distributor and retailer partners across the country. We’ve seen no impact to our people, facilities or operations and our business continues to perform very well. Unlike many of our competitors, sales of our beer brands are focused almost entirely on the U.S. market. Our company does not have much exposure to international markets such as China that have been most impacted by this situation. I’m extremely proud of the efforts of our team. We’ve built good momentum as we gear up for the upcoming summer selling season.”

>The press release cited IRI market research firm data that shows Corona dollar sales are up about 5 percent during the four-week period ending Feb. 16 — which in fact is close to double the brand’s 2.4 percent growth in 2019.

The empty shelves in the first picture have a blue pillar that says “verificator de pret” up and to the left of them. In the second picture, that same blue pillar is in the same place. The woman in the first picture has a microphone in her hand and is wearing a yellow sweater and brown pants. In the second picture, the reporter with the microphone has a yellow sweater and brown pants on. So it’s clear the second picture the same location and reporter as the first picture.

Further, based on the foodstuffs that are on the ground in the first picture, and the stocked shelves everywhere else, it’s clear there’s no shortage of anything going on at that grocery store. That means there’s no discernible reason for the shelves to be empty or for news to be there otherwise. What else could they possibly be reporting on when at a grocery store when they show empty shelving? It’s pretty clear they’re there reporting on coronavirus, because it literally says “coronavirus” on the footer. 

So, I mean - yes, it’s just two pictures. But there’s enough context in those pictures to understand what’s going on. They clearly pulled those foodstuffs off the shelf, and they clearly are there reporting on coronavirus. So what is there to doubt really? If you’re doubting that they’re saying the empty shelves are the result of coronavirus, then why else would they be showing those shelves on the news and why would the footer say “coronavirus”? 

I’m all for healthy skepticism and an awareness of disinformation online, but at a certain point we can’t eschew logic and basic common sense based on observation. We can’t just devolve into a mindset that the truth is unknowable and we can’t trust our own eyes and logic. That’s literally the point of disinformation and propaganda."

They are all trained and equipped to a single standard.

I worked in earthquakes and disasters with colleagues from 10 different forces and agencies, and we all know the same procedures, use the same equipment, follow a unified central command structure.

Italy will not fall from Coronavirus, because a global epidemic response plan has been designed and updated for more than 10 years. People will die, the economy might collapse but the emergency force is already swinging efficiently.

1. Despite an association between FCoV infection and later development of FIP in cats, *we are still not sure what causes FIP, nor why the majority of cats exposed to FCoV do not develop FIP.*   One theory is FIP is the result of an ADE-like reaction (though not ADE proper) that results in effectively induced autoimmunity; another theory is that some cats are genetically or epigenetically susceptible to FCoV infection going into fulminant FIP (that ""epigenetic"" bit is that there's genes that are normally turned ""off"" but get turned ""on"" due to specific environmental triggers, or vice versa--there is an association with cats being in stressful and crowded conditions, like kennels and animal shelters, having an increased risk).
2. FIP may actually be two separate disease processes; there's a ""wet form"" and a ""dry form"", and it is entirely possible these have different causes.
3. Feline coronavirus has a different set of target organs to human coronaviruses, particularly the viruses that cause SARS and COVID-19.  We also do not know if the immune fail that happens in end-stage FIP is in fact a result of autoimmunity or some other feline-specific immune disorder (including, again, genetic and/or epigenetic causes).
4. End-stage FIP has some symptoms with CD4 and CD8 T cells that are reminiscent of HIV infection, and coinfections with feline immunodeficiency disorders including FIV (which is caused by a retrovirus, and is effectively a feline analogue to human HIV and has been used as an experimental model for HIV--although you certainly can't get AIDS from a cat infected with FIV) and FeLV (feline leukemia virus, a different retrovirus that is...not terribly related to any human retroviruses and which is one of the first retroviruses to have a successful vaccine against it) are unfortunately distressingly common--especially in rescued feral cats.
5. The article was written in 2005, when there was less known about the pathogenesis of both SARS *and* FCoV/FIP syndromes.
6. The article, of note, is discussing the usual clinical path of fulminant FIP infection specifically in lab-reared ""pathogen free cats""--this already raises my eyebrows a bit, knowing that most ""pathogen free"" strains of lab animals are raised in sterile or nearly-sterile environments and often tend to spontaneously develop autoimmunity or adverse immune reactions.  I'd almost EXPECT CD4 and CD8 T-cell weirdness in such populations.  (In fact, the study even notes there's similar issues that pop up with inbred mice infected with various murine coronaviruses including mouse hepatitis virus--sufficiently inbred lines of laboratory mice will develop interesting immunodeficiencies and cancers if you *look* at them funny.  And before anyone makes the obvious comment: No, the CDC and NHS will *not*, in fact, authorize experimental infection of members of isolated Appalachian kindreds, Old Order Amish communities, persons of Cajun descent, members by blood descent of certain royal houses related to the Houses of Hapsburg, Bourbon or Hanover, or any other group of people who have sufficient levels of historic inbreeding (such that there are ""heritage genetic diseases"" associated) with COVID-19.  This is in general considered Highly Unethical.)
7. There has not been any evidence shown so far of an HIV-like syndrome occurring in humans with COVID-19 of the sort noted in the study in cats.  (This is not to say the immune response might not go wonky if someone with a known immunodeficiency is unlucky enough to catch COVID-19; we've just not seen a published paper on it *yet*.)
8. The general goal of the study was to determine how well FCoV might work as a ""model organism"", and FIP in cats might be used to test, various drugs that can be useful against other coronaviruses (and honestly cats aren't even a good model for THAT, in my opinion; cats have remarkably sensitive little livers and kidneys, actually cannot safely take a lot of drugs we can because they simply can't process them (otherwise we'd be giving kitties reverse transcriptase inhibitors for FIV and FeLV), and results in relatively distantly-related animals to US are not so applicable to humans, as we'll note).
9. Cats...and dogs, and other Carnivora...aren't as closely related to us as mice are, much less monkeys.  (Mice and primates (including us) are actually in a group called [Euarchontoglires](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euarchontoglires); effectively ""first cousin clades"".  Cats (and Carnivora in general) are...allllllll the way over THERE in [Laurasiatheria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laurasiatherians), cladistically speaking; basically the third-cousin-twice-removed, and about all we have in common is that we're both [boreoeutherians](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boreoeutheria) which are one of the big three clades of ""placental mammals"" along with [xenarthrans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xenarthra) (anteaters and armadillos and sloths and such) and afrotherians (elephants and mammoths and hyraxes and dugongs and manatees and sengis and tenrecs and ""otter shrews"" and ""golden moles"" and aardvarks).)

Now, as in regards to COVID-19...there hasn't been documented evidence of multiphasic infection and I've not seen reports of T-cell mymphopenia with COVID-19 (which makes sense, because for most people COVID-19 is a less severe illness than SARS is)."

A total of 544 patients recovered from COVID-19 had donated their plasma to help 245 patients, 91 of whom have seen improvements in their symptoms, Guo Yanhong, an official with the National Health Commission, said at a news briefing on Friday.

China will also incentivize and encourage recovered patients to donate their plasma to help patients in severe and critical condition, she said.

Wang Guiqiang, head of the infectious disease department at Peking University First Hospital, said that the plasma of recovered patients contains antibodies that may be effective against the coronavirus, but researchers must select the most potent ones.

Du coup là à 20H je mets BFM, j'entends une chroniqueuse qui dit ""Aucun enfant dans le monde n'a été touché par le virus ils ne sont pas atteints"". Après vérification dans la dernière étude épidémiologique paru dans le NEJM, c'est complétement faux. (1 est même dans un état severe)

There is no perceived water-borne risk at this time.  Coronavirus has decent susceptibility to chlorine in the water, and feces excretion is atypical as diarrhea is not a usual symptom.  There was a report out of Hong Kong, but it was from SARS and became airborne.  This shouldn't be an issue in a normal apartment.

Air conditioners are more of a risk for bacteria.  You may wish to get a higher grade filter for your air handler though, but make sure your system can handle it.

Does air come in under the door to your apartment?  If so, you may wish to consider putting something along the bottom to provide a better seal.  While lower risk, someone coughing in the hallway could theoretically allow the virus to be sucked in.  Again, it is more likely to put some viruses on your floor, so washing your hands after handling things around the floor and not touching your face is most important.

The odds of someone coughing on another floor and enough of the virus to hit you through an open window is extremely low.  Your air has to come from somewhere, and outside is safest.  If you have a roommate who gets sick, open windows will actually reduce the odds of infection.  Also, let the sun shine in.

Your bathroom fan pulls air, it doesn't push.  It pulls from wherever it flows easiest.  Maybe from the hallway.  Maybe from outside.  You need to determine that.  Outside is preferable."

""You may have heard it is not as deadly as the flu. This is untrue. Even if this were true, the issue is not which is worse. Influenza and C19 will both continue to infect people. The major concern is two-fold: it has a higher fatality rate, it spreads to more people, and a large percentage of the people infected require hospitalization which could overwhelm the healthcare system in areas affected . I will break down each of these in turn.
---------------------------------------------
COVID-19 v influenza: COVID about 20x higher fatality rate

""Out of 44,672 patients confirmed with coronavirus in China, 1,023 individuals had died within a short period after being diagnosed.
That leaves coronavirus with a fatality rate of 2.3 percent. Compared to the season flu’s 0.1 percent, coronavirus is significantly deadlier.""

Source: https://www.ccn.com/coronavirus-is-20x-deadlier-than-the-flu-shocking-new-data-reveals/

This may not be quite as bad as it looks, as there may be a large number of people infected but not tested or hospitalized. This could drive the number down considerably. If this is the case, it worsens the prognostication in other areas namely the number of people infected. Which brings me to....
-------------------------------------------------
R0 for COVID 19: Also known as the number of people infected by each infected person

This number is very important as it indicates how many people are likely to be infected by the virus in total, which informs how global the virus is likely to get, and also how dramatic countries should respond to this threat. 

""The conclusion is: Based our Fudan-CCDC model, the growth rate r of COVID-19 is almost in [0.30, 0.32] which is larger than the growth rate 0.1 estimated by CCDC {9}, and the reproductive number R0 of COVID-19 is estimated by 3.25≤ R0 ≤3.4 if we simply use R=1+r*Tc with Tc=7.5, which is bigger than that of SARS""

The bottom line here is current estimates put the R0 at about 3.3. 
source: https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.02.17.20023747v2

-The R0 (H1N1) = 1.5
-1918-1919 pandemic strain (mean R0 approx 2: range 1.4 to 2.8) 
-Seasonal influenza (mean R0 1.3: range 0.9 to 2.1)
Source: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19545404

This means this virus spread to about twice as many people as the H1N1 virus, seasonal influenza, or the Spanish flu. 
The reason for this is likely the long incubation period. People go between 2-14 days before presenting with symptoms, which means many people spread the disease before having the opportunity to quarantine themselves.
---------------------------------------------
COVID19: complications of infection

According to the CDC, ""Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) developed in 17–29% of hospitalized patients, and secondary infection developed in 10%. Between 23–32% of hospitalized patients with 2019-nCoV infection and pneumonia have required intensive care for respiratory support.[2–3] In one study, among critically ill patients admitted to an intensive care unit, 11% received high-flow oxygen therapy, 42% received noninvasive ventilation, and 47% received mechanical ventilation""
Source: https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/clinical-guidance-management-patients.html

About a quarter of the patients that get hospitalized can expect to develop ARDS (a very serious inflammation of the lungs). Many healthcare systems are not well equipped to deal with an influx of patients to this caliber. This does not mean 1/4 of all patients infected, but 1/4 of those hospitalized. The numbers coming out of China are not trustworthy for many reasons, so it is unclear what percentage of patients who get infected require hospitalization. Hopefully this number is low. 
---------------------------------------------
COVID19: Global impact

So far, most of the cases have been isolated to China. However, due to long delay between infection and presentation of symptoms, it is expected the virus will spread to other areas of the country/ world and potentially cause a worldwide pandemic. The WHO avoids using the term 'pandemic' because they do not want to cause a panic, but it is appearing we are headed that direction. There are now 840 cases in Japan, 833 in South Korea. The full list of countries is extensive. Iran is currently the next on the list of countries about to hit by the virus. Iran's health minister, Iraj Harirchi,  just tested positive today. Italy is starting to show cases, as well as the first case in Southern Italy confirmed just this morning.

Just this morning, Austria and Croatia had their first confirmed cases. 
Source: https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/feb/25/coronavirus-live-updates-outbreak-latest-news-italy-italia-deaths-symptoms-china-stocks-wall-street-dow-jones-economy-falls

The WHO releases a daily report of the confirmed cases and where they are in the world. Here is their report from this morning:
https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/situation-reports/20200224-sitrep-35-covid-19.pdf?sfvrsn=1ac4218d_2

Which shows about 715 new cases today globally. The concern is that with the two week delay, there may be many, many more cases of people who are going to start presenting with symptoms soon. Remember, people who are asymptomatic are unlikely to seek treatment and therefore will continue to infect. The R0 of ~3.3 means each of those new cases, on average, will infect another 3.3 people. 
---------------------------------------------
So what should you do?

If you live in the US, nothing yet. There have been several confirmed cases in the USA but we have taken great precautions to prevent the spread and so far have been successful. The most important thing right now is to stay home if you are sick. There is a culture to go to work while sick in the USA but this is not the time for that. 

The world is working on a vaccine, and if it comes to market in time, it could make a huge difference. Typically this process takes about a year so we may be on our own for a while. 

I will post again in a week or two for updates, hopefully things look better by then but right now it appears as though this is just getting started. The WHO projected in early February the peak would be sometime in mid-April, and if that's the case this could get messy worldwide"""

What's going to happen when the next economic meltdown happens, what happens if it kicks off during a sanders presidency?

There is probably going to be a recession before Sanders due to Covid-19.

A major infrastructure spending programme like the Green New Deal would stimulate the economy and create jobs, raising living standards. M4A would also make ordinary people better off because they wouldn’t be struggling to buy essential medications or going bankrupt from medical bills. 

It’s well established that the right wing response to recessions (cuts and austerity) just makes them worse, whereas left wing policies of government spending are successful as long as government debt doesn’t become unmanageable, which it won’t in the US. This was the lesson of the Great Depression that everyone has forgotten.

The Green New Deal could re-establish the credibility of government that actually does things and destroy the neoliberal consensus.

The same goes for the left in other countries, as surely the recession will be global, and it will be clear that the free market can’t handle a pandemic. The shitmunchers who voted for Trump and Brexit are disproportionately old. Coronavirus will (sadly) weaken the gerontocratic voting bloc, and the complete incompetence of right wing responses to the coming pandemic will destroy the credibility of the idea that a leader should be a “good businessman” or some public school twat.

So the left has a big opportunity."

It also guarantees you'll have a job after the quarantine is over.  The ADA is the Americans with Disabilities Act, and although nobody knows if coronavirus will end up covered as a disability, it guarantees your job after you come back as well, since a leave of absence would likely be a reasonable accomodation.

As far as the financial repercussions go, there is no way to guarantee that you'll be paid, except to cancel your trip to a place where you'll be required to be quarantined upon your return.

But first, it's worth noting an obvious issue with the current numbers: the government isn't aggressively testing for the virus. Unless you came into the country from an infected area or start displaying the more serious symptoms (which only manifest in about 15% of cases), chances are nobody's gonna test you.

So there could be thousands of infections right now, and we'll have absolutely no idea until symptoms manifest. Which could take weeks to happen.

**But...** as a counterpoint to that, it's been a good three months since the outbreak started, and we're only *just now* starting to see people get sick on American soil. Even without testing, that's a pretty solid indicator that the spread of the virus really is pretty limited here, even without hard data to confirm it. The lack of severe cases so far implies a lack of cases overall, at least until very recently.

So what's keeping it at bay? I do have a few ideas about this.

First, America was already braced for flu season when the virus started. The flu was particularly nasty this year; it really beat the crap out of a lot of people I know, and that made everyone in my social circle a bit paranoid. Many of us are already washing our hands frequently, less likely to go outside, etc. If enough people reacted the same way, that's probably slowing the virus down a tad.

Second, drugs may also be playing a part here. Thanks to the flu, pharmacies are fully stocked with cheap cold medicine. Now, don't misunderstand me; that stuff can't kill the coronavirus or make it any less infectious. But it *does* alleviate the common symptoms, and lessens the impact it has on our daily lives. That may be why we've seen so few severe cases, even though the virus is clearly in circulation. The relevant medicine is freely available, and people are already taking it.

Lastly, America just has far fewer vectors for the virus to spread. Outside of cities, population density is pretty low, making it less likely that we walk by an infected person on the street. Most of the country lacks widespread public transportation, limiting a virus's ability to infect large numbers of people at once. The prevalence of social media has made physical meetups between friends less common, screwing the virus out of even more potential hosts.

I also think an underrated factor here is the fact that we have a very antisocial culture in general. I'm not sure how it is in the rest of the country, but here in New England, we're very averse to physical contact unless it's with close friends or family members. The more physical distance between us, the more difficult it is for a virus to spread within our social circle. And we New Englanders are a very cold people.

Will all of this stop the coronavirus? Not a chance. But if we're lucky, it should make for a slower, more gradual burn through the population, with a lower kill rate overall."

The manufacturer had recently notified the agency of its shortage but it just became clear that it was related to disruptions in the production of its active ingredient in China, Commissioner Stephen Hahn said. He added the agency is working with companies to mitigate the shortage.

FDA did not identify the medicine, but it updates its drug shortage list daily. New additions over the past few days included antibacterial infusion Avycaz and Mylan-made beta-blocker Pindolol, for which stock is low because of shortage of an active ingredient.

FDA also shed light on possible challenges for device supplies. It announced that is knows of 63 manufacturers that utilize 72 factories in China to make ""essential"" medical devices — including many with worker shortages due to the coronavirus. No such devices are reported to be in short supply, but device makers aren't legally required to disclose if circumstances exist that could lead to shortages.

Widespread shortages of personal protective equipment like masks, gloves or surgical gowns are not being reported, but FDA said it is aware of reports that health care providers are increasing orders of the protective devices to prepare for a potential severe U.S. outbreak. Some related supply challenges for certain devices have been reported to the agency.

LIMITED CORONAVIRUS TESTING CAPACITY THREATENS U.S. RESPONSE — Federal officials are also scrambling to avert a public health crisis and reduce the odds of a full-fledged coronavirus outbreak.

CDC announced the first potential case of community spread in Northern California on Wednesday night, shortly after President Donald Trump addressed the nation on the outbreak. A hospital memo revealed that stringent federal rules prevented testing of the patient for a full week, despite multiple requests by doctors.

Public health laboratories have faced widespread challenges verifying CDC’s emergency diagnostic, and only a handful are actively testing for the virus. The agency’s Atlanta headquarters is only able to test 350 to 500 samples a day, according to agency Director Robert Redfield.

The CDC chief said that other countries have been able to expand screening faster than the United States, blaming the delay on federal regulations that govern tests developed in-house by hospitals and laboratories. Redfield also said that FDA has been supportive of efforts to boost testing, POLITICO’s Brianna Ehley reports.

The Association of Public Health Laboratories told POLITICO that even if all public health labs were able to test for the virus using the CDC diagnostic, they would only be able to analyze about 100 tests per day. That raises questions about whether the United States would be able to screen enough suspected cases in a large outbreak.

“We haven’t looked widely enough to believe that it is not here outside the known cases,” said Marc Lipsitch, an epidemiology professor at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health. “China tested 320,000 people in Guangdong over a three-week period. This is the scale we need to be thinking on,” he added.

CDC EXPANDS TESTING CRITERIA — Redfield told lawmakers Thursday that doctors nationwide will now be allowed to screen anyone they suspect is infected with coronavirus.

Earlier CDC criteria limited testing to people experiencing symptoms who had traveled from affected countries or had been in contact with someone known to have the virus.

MORE CAPACITY ON THE WAY? — HHS Secretary Alex Azar told lawmakers Thursday at least 40 labs should now be able to test for coronavirus after FDA authorized a modified version of CDC’s diagnostic.

But APHL senior director of public policy Peter Kyriacopoulos said it will likely take days for those labs to get testing up and running.

“They are now working through the process of making certain that the science works in each of their operations, which is exactly what you want to do,” Kyriacopoulos said.

FDA appears open to allowing labs to use a shared laboratory developed test under a standard protocol, according to a letter Commissioner Stephen Hahn sent to APHL.

The public health labs still must submit the test to FDA for review, according to the agency — which says the law requires it to evaluate such tests in emergency situations.

“FDA has developed a template to streamline the process to facilitate the protocol that you propose while ensuring FDA’s appropriate oversight,” Hahn wrote in the letter.

Diagnostic maker Qiagen confirmed to POLITICO that it plans to ask FDA to grant an emergency use authorization for its coronavirus diagnostic by Monday at the latest.

AZAR: WE CAN’T CONTROL A CORONAVIRUS VAX’S COST, BUT WE’ll TRY — HHS Secretary Alex Azar said in a congressional hearing this week that the government can’t promise an affordable coronavirus vaccine when one eventually launches (which NIAID’s Anthony Fauci says is still at least a year away).

“We would want to ensure that we work to make it affordable, but we can’t control that price because we need the private sector to invest,” Azar told the House Energy and Commerce committee Wednesday. The secretary softened his approach in a Ways and Means hearing the next day, telling lawmakers that the administration would “work to ensure that there are appropriate protections” to make federally funded vaccines — like the Moderna product with NIH, or the BARDA-funded Johnson & Johnson candidate — affordable.

Drug pricing advocates and Democrats remain unimpressed. Any potential coronavirus vaccine ""should be available to everyone, not dependent on 'Big Pharma,’” Speaker Nancy Pelosi said in a press conference Thursday.

The U.S. government is driving coronavirus vaccine research, Public Citizen president Robert Weissman pointed out in a statement that called for the government to commit to nonexclusive licensing of whatever vaccine is developed.

It’s “not just a matter of justice and avoiding profiteering, it’s a matter of public health urgency,” said Weissman. “If the vaccine is not made affordable around the world, then it won’t work to stop what could turn into a global pandemic.”

INDUSTRY: WE’RE DONATING COMPOUNDS, SUPPLIES IN CORONAVIRUS FIGHT — Drugmakers have donated compounds with the potential to treat coronavirus for emergency use and research, along with much-needed medical supplies, drug industry lobby PhRMA said this week. Several companies are also at work on vaccines or treatments, including Moderna, J&J and Gilead.

PhRMA also said that its members are working hard to prevent or mitigate potential drug shortages, and have partnered with both U.S. and Chinese health agencies to focus on research that could speed up development of coronavirus therapies."

I think isolated situations where the case number can be considered more accurate are better indicators, such as the Diamond Princess cruise ship, where we probably know most of the positive cases, even the mild ones.

Currently the numbers for Diamond Princess stand at 705 cases and 6 fatalities, which amounts to a 0.85% CFR. This may change over time, of course, as there are still 34 serious/critical cases. There's also the problem that the cruise passengers are probably not representative of the full population. They're probably older on average, but at the same time, probably don't include the sickest people in the full population.

>In its latest budget proposal, the Trump administration sought to cut CDC funding by 16% - even as Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar seeks emergency spending from lawmakers to combat the coronavirus.

EDIT: I'll also add data from OPs link below that shows the effect of prior budget cuts, submitted by the President and approved by Congress.

https://fortune.com/2020/02/26/coronavirus-covid-19-cdc-budget-cuts-us-trump/

https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/to-your-health/wp/2018/02/01/cdc-to-cut-by-80-percent-efforts-to-prevent-global-disease-outbreak/

It appears that the funds CDC had for the GHSI were running out.

>And he also suggested $15 billion in reduced health spending, cutting the global disease-fighting budgets of the CDC, National Security Council (NSC), Department of Homeland Security (DHS), and Health and Human Services (HHS) in the process.

>The effects of those cuts are being felt today. While the CDC announced plans to test people with flu-like symptoms for COVID-19, those have been delayed and only three of the country’s 100 public-health labs have been able to test for coronavirus. The administration’s request for additional funding came roughly two weeks after officials said HHS was almost out of funding for its response to the virus.

So with the 2018 cuts, the CDC had limited resources to respond without additional funds.

This is similar to historical military reductions, followed by the outbreak of conflict where the military had to rush to refill the ranks. Many had learned from this. Some haven't. It's not quick and easy to ""get the right people."""

The coronavirus, or the COVID-19 virus, originated in Wuhan, China, and has killed 2,700 people and spread to 30 countries. There are at least 36 confirmed cases in the US, including repatriated citizens.

Here are some other actions the Trump administration undertook to dismantle government-spending programs related to fighting the spread of global diseases, [according to Foreign Policy](https://foreignpolicy.com/2020/01/31/coronavirus-china-trump-united-states-public-health-emergency-response/):

&#x200B;

* Shutting down the entire global-health-security unit of the National Security Council.
* Eliminating the US government's $30 million Complex Crises Fund.
* Reducing national health spending by $15 billion.
* Consistently attacking Mark Green, the director of the US Agency for International Development.

The CDC is working on a new test to screen for the coronavirus, but [according to New York magazine](https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2020/02/what-we-know-about-the-trump-admins-response-to-coronavirus.html), problems with the test's development resulted in only three out of 100 public-health labs being equipped to screen for the virus. Moreover, each test costs as much as $250, and the Health and Human Services Department is already running out of money to finance an adequate response to the outbreak.

In its latest budget proposal, the Trump administration sought to cut CDC funding by 16% — even as Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar [**seeks emergency spending**](https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/democrats-health-officials-trump-coronavirus-comment-emergency-funding-package-small-2020-2-1028937498?utm_source=markets&utm_medium=ingest) from lawmakers to combat the coronavirus.

The Belt and Road Initiative (BRI, or B&R) is a global development strategy adopted by the Chinese government in 2013 involving infrastructure development and investments in nearly 70 countries and international organizations in Asia, Europe, and Africa.The leader of the People's Republic of China, Xi Jinping, originally announced the strategy during official visits to Indonesia and Kazakhstan in 2013. ""Belt"" refers to the overland routes for road and rail transportation, called ""the Silk Road Economic Belt""; whereas ""road"" refers to the sea routes, or the 21st Century Maritime Silk Road.Formerly known as One Belt One Road (OBOR) (Chinese: 一带一路, short for the Silk Road Economic Belt and the 21st-century Maritime Silk Road (丝绸之路经济带和21世纪海上丝绸之路)), it has been referred to as the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) since 2016 when the Chinese government considered the emphasis on the word ""one"" was prone to misinterpretation. However, ""One Belt One Road"" (一带一路) is still used in Chinese-language media.The Chinese government calls the initiative ""a bid to enhance regional connectivity and embrace a brighter future"". Some observers see it as a push for Chinese dominance in global affairs with a China-centered trading network.

Her friend said it was the worst cold of her life and that she felt like she couldn't breath. She said their fevers would go and come back and that at one point the three of them just slept in the living room together to keep an eye on each other. Her grandma brought them food and left it at their door. Keep in mind these people never got tested for the virus, never went to the doctor and just took regular cold medicine. They're better now but they're convinced they had it, as they had all the same symptoms. Another cousin of her friend had the same thing happen with all the same symptoms and he recovered and was not tested by doctors. Sure, its possible none of these people got the coronavirus but given the similarity of the symptoms and the pandemic happening its very likely they had it, recovered and never got tested.

Local health officials and doctors were silenced and some jailed because they were trying to blow the whistle.

Anthony Eden, another old Etonian prime minister, believed in 1956 that the nation and the world would rally around his decision to go to war with Egypt after Gamal Abdel Nasser decided to take the Suez Canal into public ownership.  
>  
>Johnson appears to believe that the British nation and global public opinion will support his breaking off talks with Europe if Britain is not awarded a special status by June and he opts for a no-deal crash-out instead.  
>  
>He may be right and he will have the support of the *Daily Express* and *The Sun*, but he may have misjudged how far Britain wants to go into a war with 450 million Europeans.  
>  
>Unlike the finest hour of 1940, when there was a real threat to Britain, all that the rest of the EU27 wants to do is keep frontiers open, welcome British business and allow Britons to keep living, working or retiring in the warmer regions of Europe.  
>  
>Johnson may attempt to dress himself in Churchill’s boiler suit, just as Eden believed that by attacking Egypt he was defending core Western interests against a mad dictator in Cairo.  
>  
>But the world watched with horror. The American president, Dwight Eisenhower, phoned up Eden, saying: “Anthony, are you mad?” and cut off financial support and access to US oil supplies. Tory MPs, beyond the usual lumpen loyalists and knee-jerk Nasser-bashers, then went very quiet.  
>  
>Johnson should pay heed to Steve Baker, head of the European Research Group (ERG), a pressure group of anti-EU MPs that did all the organising and coordinating to make Theresa May’s life impossible and replace her with Johnson.  
>  
>Baker stood down this week as leader of the ERG because he says Brexit has happened – thus, mission accomplished. He is not an intellectual or a political theorist, but he is cunning and fluent, and he held the group together.  
>  
>He is being replaced by [Mark Francois](https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/mark-francois), whose election campaigning consists of walking around his constituency with a Union Jack coat on his bulldog, and denouncing to all and sundry the presence of immigrants in Britain.  
>  
>In 2007, William Hague chose Francois to be shadow minister of state for Europe as a way of pandering to the growing Ukip tendency in the Conservative Party.  
>  
>In 2010, when Hague became foreign secretary, he shunted Francois into a minor post in the Whips’ Office as it would have been too embarrassing to send the boorish Europhobe to represent the UK in European capitals.  
>  
>Francois can be expected to parrot Johnson’s anti-EU lines, but there is an internal contradiction between Baker’s belief that Brexit has happened and any future statement by Johnson that this is not the case and that the UK has to go for a full-on rupture by walking out of talks.  
>  
>In a world fearful of the coronavirus and uncertain about Trump’s isolationist and protectionist tendencies, rejecting all cooperation and patient dialogue with Europe will seem badly misjudged.  
>  
>The Tories will have to raise taxes or massively increase government borrowing, which Sajid Javid warned against in his resignation speech. The government will soon have to make decisions soon will annoy a lot of people and upset business.  
>  
>The proposal by some ministers to open UK supermarket shelves to food produced by corrupt American food and agro giants, which operate under much lower safety standards, has been denounced by Minette Batters, president of the National Farmers' Union, as “immoral and insane”.

>Tory shire MPs are very close to farmers, and “red wall” Tory MPs must be uneasy when they hear the CEO of Nissan’s European operations saying that losing existing market access would lead to the closure of the Sunderland plant.

Your analysis does not properly consider transmission rate. R0 for the Flu is 1.3, and estimates for coronavirus are around 2.  That means for every 10 people who get exposed, 1.3 and 2 people get infected, respectively. If you want to calculate the fatality rate for an exposed population, multiply your numbers by R0/10.

Influenza: 1/757 \* 1.3/10 = 1 in 5823

COVID-19: 1/48 \* 2/10 = 1 in 240

Put another way, COVID-19 is 24 times more deadly in a population than Flu. To line this up apples-to-apples to your analysis, you say ""20-40 living in an average city block"" would die from coronavirus. If that were true, you'd expect to see 1-2 people on an average city block dying of the Flu each season."

Listen to the WHO and CDC and other government websites.

You set the paw down, its last finger curling inward, and pick up the headset turning back to your games. Finally, you'll be at perfect harmony here in your safe and cozy room. You unpause skyrim as the TV in the corner plays the news.

After awhile you end up back on Rainbow Six, you're crushing it, even as your teammates fall leaving you alone you hunt the remaining four enemies out. ""Das sah ich nicht kommen"" one of your teammates laughs as you blast an enemy through a wall. ""Die linke!"" Another teammate shouts as the second to last enemy drops down through a hole. You finish them and their ally. Victory.

The endorphin rush feels amazing, even better than before. You smile fondly at the paw. Turning to the news on the TV, a reporter sits behind a desk, ""...Amerikanische Präsident hat keine Quarintine ausgegeben"" you think about those crazy people across the sea. If they wanted to pretend the Coronavirus wasnt a threat so be it.

Days pass, you never want for food or water. The games are all a rush. You never grow bored, and even still you have all the media you could desire, movies, anime, Reddit. The news outside grows worse however.

The virus had mutated, finally adapting fully to its new human host, fatality rates jump from .2% to 34%. Your parents call, several family members are dead, your father is sick. You watch a new Isekai.

A war starts in Egypt, the fertile cresent once again being torn apart. You enjoy some games of overwatch.

The Americans have resorted to flooding into Canada to try and evade the high prices on their own medicine. The Canadians kill them at the border. You watch some episodes of Dark.

North Korea bombs South Korea and takes over the husk that is left behind. You smile absentmindedly out the window. The city is burning.

Eventually everything calms down. Or at least no one seems interested in televising the news. You sit and use some canned air to clean out the vents on your PC.

You scour the internet looking for news, but its been months, or perhaps years, since the tinder box that was the world had ignited and burned. You smile while looking at the last published post on reddit. An ask Reddit thread about those people that were lost. It was published four years ago.

You reminisce about all the fun you've been having, safe in your bubble, while your country burned and you family died. You think about how much fun there will be, forever into the future, playing the games and tv shows and replays of the news over and over. Forever, and forever happy."

>MHLW states that Japan has so far conducted the test on 1,017 people until Feb. 24, but this number is flawed, since this nation-wide official statistics (in Japan) in fact don't include the test conducted to the closed contacts of the previous confirmed (by individual prefectures and other municipalities). In short, what MHLW offers as the total tested cumulative figure is, to to speak, a tip of iceberg.  


This passage from Hokkaido Shinbun is also confirmed by the following small annotation in MHLW statistics of the tested as well as confirmed in their official site that has just added since the update of Feb. 25 version:  

* Feb. 21 (without annotation) : https://www.mhlw.go.jp/stf/newpage_09690.html

(English translation) Proviso: The figures of PCR tested in domestic cases only counts on the reported cases conducted in the framework of pseudo cases reporting system, i.e. not includes all the cases conducted by individual municipalities, such as the re-confirming negative when discharged or not pseudo cases reporting (Note from the translators: this apples to the test for the closed contacts, I suppose).

2020-02-28,thenetmonkey,Coronavirus,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/fau5wd/new_york_is_making_its_own_test_because_theyre/fj1otfa/,"This article summarized the problems the US faces in managing this novel coronavirus: https://foreignpolicy.com/2020/01/31/coronavirus-china-trump-united-states-public-health-emergency-response/

This quote in particular is possibly what the commenter before you is talking about:

>	In 2018, the Trump administration fired the government’s entire pandemic response chain of command, including the White House management infrastructure. 

This fortune article explains that part of that chain of command that the whitehouse cut was CDCs pandemic response unit. https://fortune.com/2020/02/26/coronavirus-covid-19-cdc-budget-cuts-us-trump/ The first few paragraphs of that article show all of that programs and services that were cut or received significantly reduced funding. 

Normally there is a system of checks and balances where the legislative branch pushes back on a President’s budget recommendations but that was not the state of affairs in 2018. 

So now we have Mike Pence as the President’s appointee for head of coronavirus response. This is problematic because he has no background in successfully managing large public health issues. 

Here is an article from 2018 explaining how he mismanaged an aids epidemic while he was governor of Indiana. https://www.thenation.com/article/archive/mike-pence-is-still-to-blame-for-an-hiv-outbreak-in-indiana-but-for-new-reasons/ 

Neither does he have any experience or expertise in this area so it will be a struggle to create a team and chain of command appropriately staffed with people who are actually good at this because he doesn’t know how to even verify them. Coming up with a team and organization able to effectively manage a potential nationwide pandemic is not something you can create out of thin air on short notice. 

All of this combined means that if this virus spreads the US is ill equipped to manage and respond to it."

she first worked for an escort agency from 20-21, then quit and returned to the normal world. 

apparently, she got engaged to some dude at some point. dude (allegedly) cheated on her, and she called off the wedding, and had a mental breakdown. afterwards, she returned to the hoe life: found a main sugar daddy and built up additional clientele on the side. 

she would still ""date"" people (men and women) off tinder (in addition to her clients/SD); she wouldn't tell these ones about her ""job"", which is honestly pretty worrying from a health perspective. 

we stopped being friends recently after she told me she was worried about catching coronavirus from her clients, and I pointed out she had a higher risk of catching STDs. lol. this triggered tf out of her.

I don't necessarily think she was a bad kid. she was ashamed about it all, told me she felt guilty when dudes with rings showed up especially, but the money was too good.

she's 27 now (I'll give her props for being a childless latina at this age, too, lol), and while she still looks pretty young (save for the sad/traumatized eyes), her youth is coming to an end, and boy, are things gonna get worse for her."

They correctly observed that its not hard for a coronavirus in bats to become a risk to humans. 


The characteristic of the coronavirus that makes it really infectious isnt taken directly from HIV. Its just common to a lot of dangerous diseases and HIV and Ebola virus disease are the ones people will be familiar with. 

It's not really surprising that an HIV researcher with decades of experience in government and global health would get picked to work in responding to a global virus threat.

And your last link says absolutely nothing about a 14 percent reinfection rate. We don't know if this was due to reinfection, bad testing, or other issues.

“This is not the first respiratory virus epidemic or pandemic we’ll see, nor will it be the last,” said infectious disease specialist [Anita Sircar](https://www.providence.org/doctors/profile/867900-anita-devi-sircar), MD, Providence Little Company of Mary Medical Center in California.

“It’s too easy to believe everything that’s posted on Facebook or Twitter and get swayed into hysteria. Educating yourself on what’s happening is the strongest weapon against panic,” she added.

 [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus) 

 **Coronaviruses** are a group of [viruses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus) that cause diseases in mammals and birds. In humans, coronaviruses cause [respiratory tract infections](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Respiratory_tract_infection) that are typically mild, such as the [common cold](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_cold), though rarer forms such as [SARS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Severe_acute_respiratory_syndrome), [MERS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_East_respiratory_syndrome) and [COVID-19](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19) can be lethal. Symptoms vary in other species: in chickens, they cause an [upper respiratory tract disease](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Upper_respiratory_tract_infection), while in cows and pigs they cause [diarrhea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diarrhea). There are no [vaccines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccine) or [antiviral drugs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antiviral_drug) to prevent or treat human coronavirus infections. 

&#x200B;

TLDR: Stop panicking, stop believing every news report you read, and stop with the fear mongering.  This is not the first coronavirus humanity has faced, and it won't be our last.    Stop spreading misinformation.  You are more likely to die from a strain of the Flu or Pneumonia then you are this latest coronoavirus."

I think it's best to focus on what we do know.

We know the severe cases + deaths that they are releasing.

And we know that 20% of cases become severe - based on the study of 44,000 cases. 

From this we can calculate a *relatively* accurate total infection number.

As the virus spreads I'm sure most countries will eventually stop trying to find and confirm every case, and instead we'll be basing high-risk areas and countries on severe + deceased numbers."

The CDC warnings, stock market crashing, and the major press conference to all of the country about a looming unpredictable threat, thus the mainstream media is finally allowed to cover the coronavirus topic, which in turn will fuel social media platforms like Reddit. These huge events culminated very quickly the last few days, so now we are seeing the media frenzy.

In the past week, Covid-19 has started behaving a lot like the once-in-a-century pathogen we’ve been worried about. I hope it’s not that bad, but we should assume it will be until we know otherwise.

There are two reasons that Covid-19 is such a threat. First, it can kill healthy adults in addition to elderly people with existing health problems. The data so far suggest that the virus has a case fatality risk around 1%; this rate would make it many times more severe than typical seasonal influenza, putting it somewhere between the 1957 influenza pandemic (0.6%) and the 1918 influenza pandemic (2%).

Second, Covid-19 is transmitted quite efficiently. The average infected person spreads the disease to two or three others — an exponential rate of increase. There is also strong evidence that it can be transmitted by people who are just mildly ill or even presymptomatic. That means Covid-19 will be much harder to contain than the Middle East respiratory syndrome or severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), which were spread much less efficiently and only by symptomatic people. In fact, Covid-19 has already caused 10 times as many cases as SARS in a quarter of the time.

National, state, and local governments and public health agencies can take steps over the next few weeks to slow the virus’s spread. For example, in addition to helping their own citizens respond, donor governments can help low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) prepare for this pandemic. Many LMIC health systems are already stretched thin, and a pathogen like the coronavirus can quickly overwhelm them. And poorer countries have little political or economic leverage, given wealthier countries’ natural desire to put their own people first."""

His administration is also handling this terribly. 

Trump supporters literally think that all of this is a lie that the Democrats have the entire world in on some kind of ploy to make Trump look bad.
I've even heard a MAGA supporter say that coronavirus is from a man made lab, but it's here in the US and Democrats traveled to China to start all of this. Again to make Trump look bad. 

Trump is getting well deserved blame for the way he is handling this. Trump supporters are just straight up delusional."

*From the story, from health care reporter* [*Ben Conarck*](https://twitter.com/newsbysmiley#storylink=authorcard) *and politics reporter* [*David Smiley*](https://twitter.com/newsbysmiley#storylink=authorcard)*:*

>The news from Florida officials came hours after the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention announced that it has significantly expanded its guidance on selecting patients who should be tested for novel coronavirus. Federal officials said physicians should now be determining whether any patient who presents with severe pneumonia symptoms should undergo tests for novel coronavirus, regardless of their travel history.  
>  
>That expansion of criteria for testing could pose logistical issues in South Florida, where state and local health officials have yet to shore up their ability to confirm cases of the disease on their own without relying on sending specimens to be tested at the federal lab in Atlanta.  
>  
>Dr. David Farcy, chairman of the department of emergency medicine at Mount Sinai Medical Center, said the move by the CDC was surprising because of the difficulties seen so far with testing for coronavirus, but he also said it was reasonable given the global spread of the disease.  
>  
>Farcy said the next 24 to 48 hours will be crucial in determining whether state and local health officials can get testing capabilities up to speed to keep up with the expansion of criteria. He anticipated that the number of patients subject to being quarantined at home or in a hospital could rise sharply.  
>  
>“There could be lots of logistical challenges,” Farcy said, adding that Mount Sinaihas been preparing since early January to streamline its own protocols for identifying patients who might have coronavirus.  
>  
>The developments on Friday represented the latest shifts in the epidemiological landscape for the tourist hub of Miami-Dade as the global threat of novel coronavirus, also known as covid-19, intensifies. The virus has already forced drastic responses across the world, putting South Florida on edge as it braces for two of the biggest events on its calendar: Spring Break and Ultra music fest.

Also, Im a little worried because the last time this happened was 6 years ago, and Id imagine more labs have popped up in that time to handle things like this (though CDC says our preparedness for diseases is laughably bad).


I dont know anything about how a stock works, but PURELY based on previous performance, which only 3 or 4 instances have occurred so its not even the best indicator, I think the targets of $10 are very reasonable

All I have to back this up are the years lining up and the fact that the october rise in 2014 of IBIO matches up almost exactly with experimental Ebola vaccines being produced around that time.

2020-02-28,TIYAT,Coronavirus,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/fayyqu/chinese_scientists_found_that_the_new_coronavirus/fj1xv03/,"Caixin reports that by December 27 labs in Guangzhou and later Beijing had already identified a dangerous new SARS-like virus after receiving samples from Wuhan, and that both Hubei provincial authorities (on January 1) and the Chinese National Health Commission (on January 3) issued orders to restrict information and destroy samples. 

But the orders came too late to stop samples from reaching Professor Zhang Yongzhen at Fudan University in Shanghai. Professor Zhang completed his own sequencing by January 5, alerted the Chinese CDC, and publicly posted the genomic information for the new virus on January 11. 

> As early as Dec. 27, a Guangzhou-based genomics company had sequenced most of the virus from fluid samples from the lung of a 65-year old deliveryman who worked at the seafood market where many of the first cases emerged. The results showed an alarming similarity to the deadly SARS coronavirus that killed nearly 800 people between 2002 and 2003.
> 
> Around that time, local doctors sent at least eight other patient samples from hospitals around Wuhan to multiple Chinese genomics companies, including industry heavyweight BGI, as they worked to determine what was behind a growing number of cases of unexplained respiratory disease. The results all pointed to a dangerous SARS-like virus.
> 
> ...
> 
> On Jan. 1, after several batches of genome sequence results had been returned to hospitals and submitted to health authorities, an employee of one genomics company received a phone call from an official at the Hubei Provincial Health Commission, ordering the company to stop testing samples from Wuhan related to the new disease and destroy all existing samples. The employee spoke on condition of anonymity, saying they were told to immediately cease releasing test results and information about the tests, and report any future results to authorities.
> 
> Then on Jan. 3, China’s National Health Commission (NHC), the nation’s top health authority, ordered institutions not to publish any information related to the unknown disease, and ordered labs to transfer any samples they had to designated testing institutions, or to destroy them. The order, which Caixin has seen, did not specify any designated testing institutions.
> 
> ...
> 
> A different social media post, believed to have been made by a Vision Medicals employee, sheds more light on the company’s early work. The author of the post, made on Jan. 28, said only that they worked at a private company based in Huangpu, Guangzhou, where Vision Medicals is located.
> 
> The post’s author said they noticed a close similarity with the SARS coronavirus in test results of a sample collected on Dec. 24, but decided to study the results more closely before returning them, due their significance. The company did, however, share the data with the Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, according to the article.
> 
> ...
> 
> While researchers at Vision Medicals mulled their findings, the Central Hospital of Wuhan sent swabs from two other patients with the mysterious pneumonia to a Beijing-based lab, CapitalBio Medlab Co. Ltd., for study.
> 
> ...
> 
> On the evening of Dec. 30, several doctors in Wuhan, including the late Li Wenliang, privately shared CapitalBio’s results as a warning to friends and colleagues to take protective measures. Those messages then circulated widely online and sparked a public uproar demanding more information. Several people, including Li and two other doctors who sent the messages that night, were later punished by authorities for “spreading rumors.”
> 
> ...
> 
> On Jan. 1, gene sequencing companies received an order from Hubei’s health commission to stop testing and destroy all samples, according to an employee at one. “If you test it in the future, be sure to report it to us,” the person said they were told by phone.
> 
> Two days later on Jan. 3, the National Health Commission issued its gag order and said the Wuhan pneumonia samples needed to be treated as highly pathogenic microorganisms — and that any samples needed to be moved to approved testing facilities or destroyed.
> 
> One virologist told Caixin that even the Wuhan Institute of Virology (WIV) under the Chinese Academy of Sciences was not qualified for the tests and told to destroy samples in its lab.
>

4. Would really space out any travel stock purchases considerably. This situation is going to effect travel in particular and best case is probably if things stay around these levels for a while. Worst case and these names can go a lot lower.

5. There has been considerable concern about Google getting further into travel and this has effected Expedia in particular. In terms of the Google aspect, there was a good speech by Chamath Palihapitiya about Google late last year.

""Palihapitiya said this can be seen in how Google is being run. “The first thing they do is separate the core search business, which is effectively Google, from everything else.

“The second thing to buy themselves more time is they turn up the heat on the core search business to make more money. The longer they take to find that second act the more you’re fucked.”

Palihapitiya added this means that every firm that feeds off Google will see their profitability erode while Google’s remains stable.

“If you have not figured out how to be unique, you are in a very bad situation. I see this playing out with TripAdvisor and Expedia."""

There has been talk for a while now (years) about how consumer spending has been carrying the economy as business investment has fallen back. Also talk about how recovery from events like this often is generated by stifled consumer demand jumping back up after forced hiatus, and the markets recovering from a natural flow of investors moving to depressed stocks.

Here is my question in that context. With the govt scheduled to slow repo spending in April. Stacked with sustained limited manufacturing during quarantine, potential small/med business failure from lack of consumers and components, job loss from failing businesses and depleted individuals funds from a month or two with no pay from many not able to work from home. The corrections after govt stops subsidizing liquidity, and a returning workforce with sequelae requiring cont'd medical care. How can this economic recovery look anything like previous models being used today?

People with no jobs and no money can't have pent up demand to buy supply that will take months to replenish and be unavailable at scale until what seems like q3 or q4. The consumer both economically and literally is going to be sick and dying for what [@ScottGottliebMD](https://twitter.com/ScottGottliebMD) [@DrTomFrieden](https://twitter.com/DrTomFrieden) [@T\_Inglesby](https://twitter.com/T_Inglesby) and others suggest could be seasonal or sustained until a vaccine is developed. I am not trying to be apocalyptic, but more curious where a trajectory of economic recovery might come from.

One realm consumer confidence comes from seems to be jobs availability, but with \~90% of Fortune 1000 exposed to the Chinese supply chain disruption, as the virus spreads and losses occur... Closed companies, contracted growth at company and state levels, and a market unsubsidized. It seems like tree strikes for the consumer and a significant blow to the last leg the market had to stand on. Is this time to settle in for a long ride and can you please poke holes is what I hope is an oversimplified view of a complex situation?

It looks like the backstop against the bottom falling out of the economy is employment numbers/ consumer spending capability/ consumer confidence/ supply chain recovery. All of these variables being in the same pipeline feels like a stack of cards. The following three videos from CNBC segments seem to address this observation. Am I reading this incorrectly?

This is the post


Exactly a week before the ban on travel from China, IBM design flew in 6-7 chinese nationals for a deaign incubation program. one of those people was sick at the start of the program. Design leadership downplayed the situation and stated nothing to worry about. Cue a month later and moat of the studio is sick or trying to recover.

The level of irresponsibilty from leadership is astronomical. There has been no communication from them at all around coronavirus preparation. At the last Design Camp fire, the head of Design even made a joke regarding the virus.

Anyone else in Austin concerned?"

According to an expert, many people in Germany will be infected with the new coronavirus. ""It is likely that 60 to 70 percent will become infected, but we do not know in what time,"" said virologist Christian Drosten of the Berlin Charité hospital on Friday. ""This could well take two years or even longer."" The infection process is only problematic if it occurs in a compressed, short time. ""That's why authorities are doing everything they can to detect and slow down incipient outbreaks.""

After the corona virus Sars-CoV-2 was detected in an employee of a large consulting company in Düsseldorf, 1500 colleagues of the man are to stay at home for the time being. The management consultancy Ernst & Young (EY) reported on Friday that it had been informed about the illness of its employee on Thursday evening and had drawn conclusions from this. ""We have informed all employees of the branch concerned about it and have asked them to stay at home until further notice,"" explained a company spokesperson.

The first man in the north to contract the new coronavirus is a doctor. This was stated by Hamburg's health senator Cornelia Prüfer-Storcks (SPD) at a press conference. He works in paediatrics and youth medicine at the University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf (UKE). According to the senator, about 50 contact persons of the patient from Henstedt-Ulzburg (Segeberg district) were identified.

Gli ospedali della Lombardia alle prese con l'emergenza coronavirus sono ""ai limiti della tenuta"". Lo afferma il professor Massimo Galli, infettivologo dell'ospedale Sacco di Milano, nel corso di una conferenza stampa nella sede della Regione Lombardia. ""Gran parte dei letti, nei reparti di Rianimazione, sono occupati da questa patologia - aggiunge - Alcuni ospedali sono in grave crisi, come Lodi e Cremona, dove registriamo un sovraccarico di pazienti"".

Degli 821 contagiati (383 confermati), 345 sono i ricoverati e 85 sono in terapia intensiva.
