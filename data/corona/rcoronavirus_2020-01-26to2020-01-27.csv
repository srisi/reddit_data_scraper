Due to the long incubation period (up to 14 days), there could be hundreds if not thousands of infected individuals who are asymptotic (not showing symptoms) that are still contagious.

Not only this, but thousands of Chinese students who were in Wuhan for winter break came back to college campuses last week and could have spread the disease without showing symptoms. (Already 1 confirmed case at Arizona State University) 

Additionally, the US is still allowing flights from many parts of China, where 5 million people escaped through the Wuhan quarantine. This means that countless infected individuals could have already reached the US, and due to them being asymptomatic, are not registering on the screening systems that test for fever."

My take? - this is going to be very very bad.

Reasons ?

1) China lied/lying about original outbreak - this is the most important part. They lied which allowed the virus to reach out further

2) asymptomatic period. Biggest factor here. Too many people can be infected with having no idea, for too long of a period of time. Basically it’s a bomb with a 2 week timer, and that person spreads bombs during 2 weeks with no clue. To continue the analogy, you now have a mass terrorism issue as a large portion of the population is actively exploding (dying, becoming very ill) and actively making other people spread and explode.

3) the misinformation of deaths/chinas response. Videos we see cannot be verified, but chineese citizens risk a lot by uploading anything remotely bad. I highly doubt there’s  a large volume of people who speak Chineese clearly with Wuhan dialect taking time to stage multiple fake videos in real facilities. 

Basically, I think every single person on this planet is at risk of this effecting their area. Stay healthy, drink vitamin c. 

People on this sub are being delusional with their masks and goggles, and probably just raise their risk of infection by constantly having to put hands near their face."

If you are going by unofficial numbers (aka people in China who are trying to get word out) there are corpses lying around, and thousands infected and not getting diagnosed, and subsequently dying.

Yes, if you’re healthy and young you’re probably okay. But how many people do you know who are old? What about your parents, your grandparents? What about children?

Now, of every disease outbreak like this, how many would get that big? Idk.

In terms of fatality rate, total cases, incubation time and transmission rate, everything points to ""really really bad"" and as we're reliant on China for official numbers, there's a possibility this is much more worse- more cases, more fatalities, higher fatality rate, higher transmission rate.

But at this point it appears you've reached a critical mass of cases, with a strong suggestion quarantines were largely ineffective in China and cases have gone international. So you have people busy airports, big cities, walking around with a highly transmissible virus without showing symptoms for a whole two weeks? That's really bad news.

Maybe it's overly cautious, but if I were elderly or were immunocompromised or had a respiratory disease and in the US I'd probably be vigilant, not go outside or wear an N100 mask. Especially until it's clear there's a handle on total cases and it's not exploding upwards.

There's a strong desire not to look stupid. But given the dormancy period, by the time there's a substantial number of confirmed cases, the number of infected will be astronomical.

I'm tough so I'm not as concerned, but if new information develops suggesting someone in my city is infected I'll probably take significant precautions."

If under 40y old and generally healthy you should not have much of a risk even if you contract the disease .

The problem is that you may carry the virus with you and be contagious even if you do not yet show any symptoms so you could potentially become a vector of transmission .

I’d say make your choices based on knowing that it’s unlikely you’ll have a life threatening situation , but be wary of protections whenever out and about in the city (especially in public places or transportation) 

Masks with N95 or higher protection level are a must (they will also protect you from the raging air pollution occurring at the moment in the region due to agricultural burning)

Be wary of always disinfecting your hands after you touch people or objects (use soap and hand sanitizers) 

My personal opinion is that you should postpone your trip if you can, because seeing how worried you are may just dampen everything you’ll get to experience and see ."

Tips

1. Dont touch door handles or public items with ur hands use a cloth, rag or gloves

2. Wash your hands and sing happy birthday to yourself twice before being done that's how long it takes to get rid of contaminants on your hands

3. Use your elbows more your hands less.

4. Train yourself to not touch your face unless absolutely necessary 

5. Wear a mask you might look silly but at least you will have less of a chance on getting infected


Also just enjoy yourself and dont let this stop your life from continuing to be fun :)"

I was 17 and young males my age typically don't care about world conditions but i was watching with my dad (and shit this was rough for me even then) they interviewed this guy living in a hut in the desert. He had just lost one of his sons the week before. There food was a rotting slab of beef in a burlap sack and it was covered in flies and maggots.

Thousands had been dying. And the next day happened and they never finished the special. 

People weren't going to tune in to see dead starving Africans, that was old news anyway. The news masquerades as a moral authority and voice for the world but its really just a job, they want a profit and they go with what sells. CNN, fox, MSNBC etc are all bullshit"

Some if not, most of those people that have already died, had pre-existing medical / immune conditions.

On top of that, the people who are “falling over and dying”, they’re likely exerting themselves too much when they’re already too sick. Pneumonia can cause lack of oxygen, tie that up with over exerting yourself, yeah, you’ll fall and likely get concussed and maybe even die.

Doctors themselves are working around the clock with little to no sleep. Lack of sleep mean lack of ability to defend themselves against a virus like this. So they too, can die easily.

Bottom line is, it’s too early to tell what is going on with this virus. The ratio of infected, survivor and deaths is just too low to gauge just how serious this is besides how infectious this is."

The 14 day incubation period means exactly what you're saying. Why second guess yourself.

Common sense says 14 days means they have no idea who these people breathed on from point A to point B before being diagnosed at a healthcare facility.

Bottom line is, the virus is aggressive, it's thought to be mutating, and for the CDC to act like they got this under control is a massive lie to keep people from panicking. No better than China right now.

Fact is , hundreds of people in USA could be hosts right now and showing ZERO symptoms. The virus is transmitting in incubation stages with no signs  of being sick."

I did a quick google search, and according to the Kaiser Family Foundation, 14.3 people in the US die for every 100,000 people infected with influenza or pneumonia. That would mean your chances of dying if you have the flu is about 0.0143 percent. Meanwhile, the current estimates of your chance of dying if you have the coronavirus is around 6%, and could be higher due to hidden cases or improper accounting. That means you’re more than 400 times more likely to die from the coronavirus than the flu, while the coronavirus is also very infectious and difficult to catch in the infectious period before symptoms show.

If things were to get really bad be it any disease, goggles with a complete seal and no openings work just fine if you don't wanna buy a full facemask. Lab-approved goggles, particularly chemical splash goggles, would suffice. Gloves aren't a bad idea either.

Technically the only masks that would completely filter out the virus have to say they work for pathogens because they are extremely small. Small enough to get through most masks. N99 is the best option I've found and it makes me wonder if they actually sell pathogen ones to the public. The most it will do for you is prevent large droplets of saliva from being inhaled while helping to prevent you from touching your mouth, eyes and nose. Which is a major positive for sure. It will also keep you from spreading illnesses to other people.

I got one anyway. I figure it's better than nothing whether it helps or not."

3.	Conclusion: The mean estimate of R0 for the 2019-nCoV ranges from 3.30 (95%CI: 2.73-3.96) to 5.47 (95%CI: 4.16-7.10), and significantly larger than 1. Our findings indicate the potential of 2019-nCoV to cause outbreaks.


Significantly larger than 1 is an interesting conclusion. Basically saying “each one person who contract the 2019nCoV (2019 novel corona virus)” will pass it on to one or more people, estimation between 3 and 5 people. 

Which is really bad. This means sure, some people do not infect anyone. However for the numbers to be pulled up to 5.5 and on the low end to be 3.3 means that some people infect a lot of other people at once. Like the example of the person who infected 14 all at once."

2020-01-26,Thereian,Coronavirus,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/eudszr/asymptomatic_man_infects_14_medics_with/ffpn31f/,"I worked in an immunology lab for 4 years, I have a chemical and biomolecular engineering background, and work as a process engineer on a clinical phase immunotherapy drug (FDA new drug application submitted, so soon commercial phase). One of my closest professors was a virologist too, so I have good working knowledge of immune response to viruses.

That being said, to be clear, I don't have an epidemiology background.

This is going to be very bad, as others noted. BUT theres something super important to realize. I'm assuming you live in a developed country in the western world. We have different social customs than most of Asia, particularly when it comes to hygiene and personal space. I don't mean that as a knock on any culture, it is just a fact. Europeans and Americans just don't stand on top of eachother in the subway or in mobs at ticket counters like they do in China. We also spit a lot less and wash our hands a lot more. These cultural differences all add up to different infectivity profiles in different regions - and ours will almost certainly be lower than theirs.

In addition, \*on average\*, our hospitals are better equipped to treat critical patients. Wuhan is a very big city though, and I'm sure they have some fantastic academic setting hospitals with top-line care as well, though. But clearly they are overburdened to the point of being ineffective (see first point about rate of spread).

The big question is how much lower will infectivity be in developed western countries. If significantly lower, we'll be okay. If not, we will have massive, massive problems.

I live in the USA and I stocked up on masks and canned food today, FWIW. Better safe than sorry. I live downtown in a major city though."

The virus is ""airborne"" to the extent that it goes out into the air when someone who has it coughs or sneezes.  If you're away from people when they sneeze/cough (and not in an enclosed place like an airplane), you're pretty safe since it's not going to fly around on it's own without being human-propelled by sneeze-coughs. 

I don't know how much protection a mask would provide.  From what I understand, this virus can also enter through the eyes -

2020-01-26,PhenomenalKid,Coronavirus,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/euhzne/longer_incubation_period_compared_to_sars/ffpk1uo/,"According to [https://www.cdc.gov/sars/about/faq.html](https://www.cdc.gov/sars/about/faq.html), the incubation period of SARS is between 2-7 days, rarely 10 days, and very rarely up to 14 days.

The exact incubation period distribution of Wuhan Coronavirus is between 1-14 days; I don't think there is really enough data to say whether the 14-day case is common or if it's rare. As a corollary, I don't think there is enough data yet to say whether the incubation period of Wuhan Coronavirus is longer than that of SARS.

Out of an abundance of caution, it may be reasonable for officials to treat the incubation period as up to 14 days (for purposes of quarantine, for example) until shown otherwise.

The values that you've been hearing on social media--14-day incubation, R0 of 3.8-- these are the upper bounds of the estimates. So while the virus has the potential to match those numbers, it's likely that the real values are lower than those upper bounds."

If you want protection use handsanitiser everywhere because is confirmed that the alcohol in handsanitiser is enough to kill the virus and avoid crowded places if avoiding crowded places isn't possible wear mask that are n95 qualified (I think it will be out of stock soon or the price will skyrocket.... It already is on Amazon so) if you can't find n95 mask a common medical grade mask is better than nothing.   

It's also important to keep the house clean and with a good air circulation. Avoid airport and hospitals and don't panic just because people around you show symptoms and don't rush to the hospital because you are suspecious. Call them if you are not sure but remember hospital are crowded places and there's a higher chance you get the virus in the waiting room of the hospital than at your home.

Stop things that can reduce your immunity such as alcohol and smoking can help you lower the chance of getting the virus

Other than that...food hmmmm. Don't eat bat I guess lmao you won't become batman .

And be positive. Humanity is stronger than that. They are already working on a cure that shows significant progress you can check it on other post that I have made.  Good luck"

3. Bio-labs exist a lot more than you think, it's where research is done to develop cures for serious diseases like for instance Coronavirus. After SARS and MERS a lot of labs have been doing research into these types of viruses.
4. There is no proof linking the development of a coronavirus to this outbreak, nor is there proof showing that it was deliberately designed to have an incubation period of 2 weeks.

2020-01-26,STARWARSenal,Coronavirus,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/eu5gac/i_updated_some_charts_comparing_this_outbreak/ffn8z3j/,"Six out of the inital 41 patients have died. [That's 15%](https://www.theglobeandmail.com/world/article-weeks-before-lockdown-wuhan-authorities-used-refrigerating-strategy/) however admittedly at that sample number there is a 15% margin of error. 

There are 56 confirmed novel coronavirus deaths out of 1975 confirmed novel coronavirus cases. That's 2.8%. That number is also fluid - it is wholly irresponsible to factually state the rate is that low, because in order for that to be the case there can be no other deaths in the other 1870 cases that have not ended up yet in recovery or death (so far there are only [49 confirmed cases of recovery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_the_2019–20_Wuhan_coronavirus_outbreak)).  It could also go down, due to underreporting ([only 15% get respiratory distress](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019–20_Wuhan_coronavirus_outbreak) \- maybe it only kills 15% of the 15% that get respiratory distress, sitting mortality rate about 2.25, we just don't know), however that's a double edge sword, because it means it's way more transmissible too.

In contrast, seasonal flu is estimated to have a mortality rate [less than .1%](https://www.popsci.com/story/health/wuhan-coronavirus-faq/).

Seasonal flu has an R0 of about 1.3. Novel Coronavirus was estimated by WHO to have a R0 of somewhere between 1.4 and 2.5, at least as contagious as the flu and as much as 2x. A word of caution though, since cases have more than quadrupled in the last 5 days - this is guess work too, and the OP graph in this post of actual data suggests it's more than R0 of 2. Regardless, 1.4 is concerning enough. 

Novel Coronavirus can be [spread during the incubation period](https://www.cnn.com/2020/01/26/health/coronavirus-spread-symptoms-chinese-officials/index.html) while asymptomatic. This makes containment almost impossible without mandatory isolation and travel lockdown. 

We *may* get in front of this, and we *may* stop its spread, or it *may* mutate and do it for us. We *may* get better numbers, that explain the mortality rate better. We *may* get a better grasp of how it transmits (the talk about cough to eye transmission is alarming). You are right that ***today*** the seasonal flu is probably a greater concern for you, but there is every possibility that will change tomorrow. At present, this virus has no cure, is 1 to 2 times more transmissible than the flu, is 28-150 times more deadly, and basically cannot be contained without drastic measures. There is literally no one saying China has over reacted in locking down 50+ million people, but there are people saying too late. People that know better than you and I. 

Really the worst news so far is the asymptomatic transmission. I do hope you change your mind."

And they've been isolated and none of the cases here have been fatal. You have to realize that the situation in China and Wuhan are dramatically different than here. I imagine things will become more certain one way or the other in the next few weeks but for now just wash your hands and relax. We're nowhere near the point where you need to worry like this.
Honestly just stay of these subs for now. If there is a critical development the CDC will make an announcement (I. E. Person to person infections out in the populace)  for now there is no reason to get worked up to the point of worrying about the mortality of you family.

We have hospitals that are in good supply and aren't over crowded even if you somehow got sick it would very likely feel like a really really shitty cold and you would be isolated and given medical assistance while your body fought it off.

This is a virus; antibiotics won’t do anything. Current antivirals aren’t doing much, with the possible exception of anti HIV drugs but that’s just rumors. 

I’m not saying you should panic, but you should remain vigilant. If you believe official numbers, this has a death rate 200x that of the flu (~2% compared to 0.01%). If you go by official numbers of the original people infected, it’s even higher (I don’t remember the exact numbers of people, but 15% of the first people diagnosed died.) 15% is high. If you are going by unofficial numbers (aka people in China who are trying to get word out) there are corpses lying around, and thousands infected and not getting diagnosed, and subsequently dying.

Yes, if you’re healthy and young you’re probably okay. But how many people do you know who are old? What about your parents, your grandparents? What about children?

Looking at [flu statistics for the US](https://www.cdc.gov/flu/about/burden/index.html) alone and taking the highest projections the total infected is approximately 45million and 61,000 of which die (likely due to old age or preexisting conditions) this represents a mortality rate of 0.135% this is likely an underestimate of the mortality rate worldwide as the US healthcare system is much better than the world average.

The current Coronavirus outbreak has a [total infected](https://gisanddata.maps.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html#/bda7594740fd40299423467b48e9ecf6) of 2800 and 80 deaths.

They are genetically very close to each other... Perfect breeding grounds for everything you don't want. To have raw parts of dead chicken in your house is a safety hazard and theoretically requires to desinfect the whole area after. Nobody I know does that really. Same for raw eggs. To eat raw pig flesh can infect you with a deadly sickness and it's a totally accepted thing. The list goes on.

Colloidal silver is a solution of silver nano-particle suspended in water. It by a physical process (aka bypassing resistance) is able to decimate bacteria, virus and fungus.

DMSO is an really interesting old school solvent that allows the colloidal silver to penetrate soft tissue, enabling it to move quickly throughout the body with no resistance.

When you nebulize these two into an aerosol solution, it enables the colloidal silver to work through the lungs into the bloodstream and rapidly dispense with foreign invaders."

This means that people infected today won't know for another 20 days and for 25% of that time, they will be contagious without knowing it. 

This means the exponential spread of confirmed cases we are seeing reported right now are really from people infected 20+ days ago.

The travel bans and quarantines just went into effect a few days ago!

The are likely thousands of people infected (from before the quarantines and travel bans) that don't even know it yet. 

In the past 24 hours the official number of cases has doubled, and the number of affected countries has doubled.

We will know a lot more in a week or two.  Either it continues to spread exponentially (as it has been the past few days), OR  the quarantines and travel bans stop the spread."

Hand washing is the best thing you can do.  And dont touch you face including eyes, and stay 6 feet away from anyone coughing."
